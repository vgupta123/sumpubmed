BACKGROUND
one of the main challenges of current nature conservation is the accelerating loss of biodiversity. even if this problem is generally recognized, there are several difficulties in quantifying the loss of biodiversity at the level of species. for example, there is a lack of traditional taxonomic specialists for particular groups of organisms and the real amount of biodiversity is therefore unknown  <cit> . this is especially true for some tropical areas, where the overall biodiversity level is the highest and its loss is the most intensive. another problem for practical biodiversity conservation is the delimitation of species . traditional concepts of typological or biological species are not universally applicable and with accumulating knowledge in evolutionary biology it is increasingly difficult to define generally what a species is. genetic approaches, like dna barcoding, are now routinely used to overcome some of these problems. they provide a cheap and easily applicable approach for discovering the taxa worth future taxonomical research and areas with high phylogenetic diversity with special conservation concern . for example,  <dig> new extant taxa of mammals were described from african mainland, madagascar and all surrounding islands between 1988– <dig>  <cit> , and in the majority, the first consideration for taxonomic delimitation was motivated by the use of genetic data.

rodents of the genus mus represent one of the most valuable biological models for biomedical and evolutionary research  <cit> . out of the four currently recognized subgenera, i.e. mus, coelomys, pyromys and nannomys, the latter comprises the african pygmy mice  <cit> . these are small rodents , endemic to the sub-saharan africa. the phylogenetic relationships, species diversity, ecology and chromosomal evolution of nannomys were recently reviewed  <cit> . they represent the most diverse lineage of the genus, with currently about  <dig> species recognized  <cit> , comprising almost half of the described mus species  <cit> . while predominantly savannah dwellers  <cit> , several species have also been trapped in forest, agricultural fields and rural areas  <cit> .

mainly due to their extensive chromosomal diversity coupled with highly conserved morphology, african pygmy mice have attracted the attention of evolutionary scientists  <cit> . they exhibit chromosomal features that are rarely recorded in other taxa, e.g. the greatest diversity of sex-autosome translocations reported so far in any mammalian lineage . thus nannomys became an important biological model for the study of processes of chromosomal speciation and mechanisms of sex determination in mammals  <cit> . recent studies have also shown that african pygmy mice are important hosts of arena viruses  <cit> , making them a target group for epidemiological surveys.

increasing numbers of molecular genetic data provide evidence for high cryptic diversity in nannomys and it is highly probable that further integrative taxonomy research will reveal new undescribed species  <cit> . furthermore, the inclusion of poorly known african mus-related rodents in molecular phylogenetic datasets may provide surprising results changing the current view on the evolutionary scenarios of nannomys. for example, the ethiopian endemic genus muriculus was recently recognized to be an internal lineage of mus  <cit> .

the genus mus diverged in asia approximately  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya and shortly after this time the ancestor of nannomys colonized africa through the arabian peninsula and miocene land bridges  <cit> . the oldest fossils of mus in africa are reported from tugen hills  about  <dig>  mya  <cit> . the highly heterogeneous environment of eastern africa can thus be considered as the place of first diversification of african mus in early pliocene, followed by a radiation caused by climatic oscillations and habitat modification  <cit> . in this context it is important to note that genetic data used so far for molecular phylogenetic inference of the african pygmy mice are strongly biased geographically in favour of material collected from savannahs in the western and southern part of the continent, while specimens from eastern africa  are clearly under-represented .figure  <dig>

more thorough geographical sampling is necessary for obtaining the correct biogeographical scenario of nannomys evolution. only a comprehensive and reliable phylogenetic hypothesis can lead to meaningful inferences on the evolution of sex-determination or virus-host co-evolution. in this study, we provide the so far most comprehensive geographic sampling of genetically characterized african pygmy mice composed of  <dig> nannomys individuals from most parts of sub-saharan africa. first, we use this pan-african dataset for the reconstruction of phylogenetic relationships within nannomys lineage. second, using the combination of species delimitation methods, we aim to estimate the presumable species richness of nannomys, highlighting groups and geographical regions necessitating further taxonomical research. finally, the dating of divergences and biogeographical reconstructions allow us to modify previous scenarios that were suggested to explain the nannomys radiation in africa.

methods
sampling
new genetic data were produced for  <dig> individuals of subgenus nannomys sampled in sub-saharan africa by the authors and their collaborators. all fieldwork complied with legal regulations in particular african countries and sampling was in accordance with local legislation . each individual was identified to the genus by the external features and the tissue sample  was stored in 96% ethanol until dna extraction. gps coordinates of each locality were recorded. new data were supplemented with  <dig> published records of genotyped and georeferenced nannomys, i.e. partial or complete sequences of mitochondrial gene for cytochrome b  were downloaded from genbank. geographical coordinates of published data were either retracted from original publications  or approximately estimated from google maps. in total, the analysed dataset includes genetic information of  <dig> individuals from approximately  <dig> localities in  <dig> african countries . for more details on analysed individuals see additional file  <dig> 

dna sequencing of cytb and irbp
dna was extracted using the dneasy blood & tissue kit . the complete cytb gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction  using primers l <dig> and h <dig>  <cit> . pcr mix contained 3 μl of genomic dna,  <dig>  units of taq polymerase , final concentrations of 3 mm mgcl <dig>   <dig> x taq buffer with 2so <dig> ,  <dig>  mm of each dntps,  <dig>  μm of each primers and ddh2o to final volume of 30 μl. the thermal profile of the pcr started with an initial denaturation at 94°c for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles composed of 30 s of denaturation at 94°c, 30 s of annealing at 50°c, and 3 min of extension at 72°c and pcr was finished by a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. the part of nuclear gene encoding the interphotoreceptor binding protein  was amplified in selected individuals  by the primers irbp <dig> and irbp <dig>  <cit> . pcr conditions were the same as above, except the final concentration of mgcl <dig> . the thermal profile of the pcr started with an initial denaturation of one step at 94°c for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of 60 s at 94°c, 60 s at 55°c, 2 min at 72°c and finished by a final extension at 72°c for 10 min. the pcr products were purified with calf intestine alkaline phosphatase  and exonuclease i  and sequenced along both strands commercially in macrogen europe using the same primers as for the pcr. both genetic markers have been previously used to successfully resolve systematic relationships in a wide range of related murid rodents  from the royal museum for central africa , muséum national d'histoire naturelle , american museum of natural history  and hungarian natural history museum  . museum samples comprised only minor part of analysed material and we used especially those from geographical areas difficult to be accessed today  and the type material of mus bufo. all museum samples were handled in a specialized laboratory of institute of vertebrate biology ascr in studenec, designed for work with rare dna to prevent contamination by samples with high quantity of dna or pcr products. dna was extracted using the jetquick tissue dna spin kit . pcr amplification and pyrosequencing on gs junior were performed according to mini-barcode protocol described by  <cit> . the main advantage of this approach in analysis of museum samples is that it allows for separating individual sequences in samples contaminated by distantly related organisms , which is not possible through the sanger sequencing.

phylogenetic reconstructions
sequences of cytb and irbp were edited and aligned in seqscape v <dig>  , producing a final alignment of  <dig> and 1276 bp, respectively. the findmodel web application  was used to identify the most appropriate substitution model for each gene. the akaike information criterion , compared among  <dig> substitution models, revealed that the model best fitting the ingroup data was the general time reversible model with a gamma-distributed rate variation across sites  for both cytb and irbp. as outgroups, we used sequences of four species from other subgenera of the genus mus, i.e. m. platythrix , m. pahari , m. caroli  and m. musculus ; two sister lineages of the genus mus within subfamily murinae, i.e. apodemus flavicollis  and ratus norvegicus ; and one species from the subfamily acomyinae, acomys cahirinus  see also  <cit> .

phylogenetic relationships within nannomys were inferred by maximum likelihood  and bayesian  approaches. ml analysis was performed using raxml  <dig>   <cit> . the gtr + g model  was selected for the six partitions, i.e. 1140 bp of cytb, 1276 bp of irbp, and both genes were partitioned also by the position of nucleotides in the codons . the robustness of the nodes was evaluated by the default bootstrap procedure with  <dig>  replications . bayesian analysis of evolutionary relationships was performed by markov chain monte carlo  method in mrbayes v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . three heated and one cold chain were employed in all analyses, and runs were initiated from random trees. two independent runs were conducted with  <dig> million generations per run; and trees and parameters were sampled every  <dig>  generations. convergence was checked using tracer v <dig>   <cit> . for each run, the first 10% of sampled trees were discarded as burn-in. bayesian posterior probabilities were used to assess branch support of the bayesian tree.

the most widespread nannomys species  is m. minutoides. for this species we performed more detailed analysis of intraspecific genetic variability. we selected  <dig> sequences belonging to this clade and trimmed the final alignment to the length of 741 bp. haplotypes were generated using dnasp software  <cit>  and a median-joining network of haplotypes was produced in the software network  <dig> . <dig>  .

delimitation of motus
we estimated the possible number of putative species  of nannomys in the sampled dataset by using two types of divergence thresholds and the cytb dataset. the first was the time threshold estimated by the generalized mixed yule coalescent  model  <cit>  which describes single-locus branching pattern as a succession of speciation events replaced at a fixed threshold time by a succession of intraspecific coalescent events. the two stages are modelled by yule process and neutral coalescent, respectively, which allows finding maximum likelihood estimate of the threshold time and evaluating statistical support for the delimited species  <cit> . in this framework reliably delimited species are those whose basal internal split occurred well after the speciation-coalescence threshold and which diverged from sister species well before it. we therefore calculated two kinds of support:  for each intra-specific basal split we calculated relative likelihood that it represents coalescence rather than speciation event by summing up akaike weights of all threshold times older or equal to its age;  for each inter-specific split we calculated relative likelihood that it represents speciation as a sum of akaike weights of threshold times younger to it. the ultrametric tree required by gmyc was produced by beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  with uncorrelated lognormal distribution of substitution rates and lognormal priors for node ages mimicking posteriors from the divergence dating . we used the yule prior assuming no intra-specific divergences . the topology was constrained to match the branching order of main lineages observed in the maximum likelihood phylogeny. the gmyc analysis was performed using the r package ‘splits’ .

the second threshold was based on sequence divergence, taken as a proxy for the amount of genetic difference among distinct gene pools. we therefore analyzed the distribution of kimura- <dig> parameter  corrected genetic distances on cytb among gmyc-delimited species  and merged the lineages with less than  <dig> % genetic distance, i.e. the mean value between sister species of rodents  <cit> . the resulting groups were designated as molecular operational taxonomic units  and provisional names were assigned to them. it is important to note that the aim of our motus delimitation approach is not to change the current taxonomy, but to highlight the taxa and geographical areas worthy of further taxonomic study, including morphological, ecological and more detailed genetic approaches.

divergence dating
time to the most recent common ancestors  of clades identified by phylogenetic analyses was estimated using a relaxed clock model with substitution rates drawn from an uncorrelated lognormal distribution in beast  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and three fossil-based calibration points: origin of extant mus, origin of extant apodemus and the arvicanthis/otomys lineage split. to avoid disproportionate impact of nannomys we fitted the evolutionary model to  <dig> concatenated cytb and irbp sequences representing main lineages of nannomys and correspondingly deep divergences across the tribes apodemini, arvicanthini, malacomyini, murini, otomyini and praomyini . the data set is reported in detail in the additional file  <dig> 

following  <cit>  we used lognormal calibration densities with zero means whose 5% and 95% quantiles were specified by appropriately chosen standard deviations and offsets and corresponded to the fossil derived minimum and maximum ages. in particular the parameters  were:   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mus, based on the earliest fossil mus and a member of progonomys considered belonging to mus stem lineage  <cit> ;   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for apodemus corresponding to 95% confidence interval of first appearance as reported by  <cit> , although we applied it to the basal split of extant species rather than to the origin of their stem lineage;   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for arvicanthis/otomys split which was derived from the earliest records of otomys  and arvicanthine genera aethomys, arvicanthis and lemniscomys  and the next relevant sample where these and related genera  are absent . based on the previous studies  <cit>  we constrained the topology to include a basal split between arvicanthini+otomyini and the rest of the species.

the mcmc simulations were run twice with  <dig> million iterations, with genealogies and model parameters sampled every  <dig> iterations. trees were linked, models and clocks were unlinked for two markers. convergence was checked using tracer v <dig>   <cit> , both runs being combined in logcombiner  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  and the maximum clade credibility tree calculated by treeannotator  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> , following the removal of 10% burn-in.

biogeographical analysis
ancestral habitat types were inferred by the bayesian analysis of discrete traits  <cit> . it models discrete states of a trait at the end of each branch as a result of a continuous time markov chain with infinitesimal transition rates determined by an overall transition rate, pair-wise transition probabilities and a base frequency of the states. following the current implementation in beast  <dig> . <dig> we used strict clock time-irreversible model so the overall transition rate was assumed uniform across the tree and transition probabilities were allowed to differ in the opposite directions. using the distribution data, we coded the  <dig> motus as inhabiting either  tropical forests in the congo basin, central and western africa;  mountains in eastern africa , or  savannah habitats in sub-saharan africa. some motus can inhabit more habitat types . the analysis in beast does not allow more variants of the tip trait, so we assigned the trait  that is the most widespread in a particular motu . the topology was fixed to match relationships between motus on the ml tree and branch lengths were time-calibrated as in the ultrametric tree for gmyc.

alternatively, we identified ancestral habitat types and rough geographic ranges by using the maximum likelihood approach implemented in the software lagrange  <cit> . the implemented model estimates geographic range evolution using a phylogenetic tree with branch lengths scaled to time, geographic  areas for all tips, and an adjacency matrix of plausibly connected areas. we used the same tree and distribution data as in the beast analysis described above. we allowed the connection between all three habitats with equal probabilities of each transition. the maximum number of ancestral ranges was set to two. the resulting reconstructions returned all models within two likelihood units of the best model, which we summarized for each daughter branch and plotted in the form of pie-charts along the tree in r  <cit> .

RESULTS
overview of collected data
for the phylogenetic analysis we retained  <dig> cytb sequences at least 700 bp  representing as complete a geographical distribution of each clade as possible . the remaining  <dig> sequences , including  <dig> sequences obtained by  <dig> pyrosequencing of old museum samples, were unambiguously assigned to particular motu by neighbour-joining analysis in mega  <dig>   and these data were used for mapping the geographical distribution of phylogenetic clades.

we also selected 1– <dig> individuals from each of the main significantly supported cytb clades  and sequenced them at irbp gene. the final phylogenetic analyses included  <dig> sequences of irbp  from all main species groups except the baoulei group . ml analyses were performed separately for both genes, and because the topology of trees was very similar , we finally performed both ml and bi reconstructions only using a concatenated cytb and irbp dataset produced in seaview  <cit> .

phylogeny of african nannomys
phylogenetic trees based on the concatenated dataset were well resolved and with very similar topology of  <dig> ingroup sequences in both ml and bi analyses . subgenus nannomys  was strongly supported. there are three long branches representing three ancient mountainous species with unresolved relationships to other groups  and five well supported species groups. we call them hereafter triton, setulosus, baoulei, sorella, and minutoides groups, based on the previous use of these names, representing the best known species within particular clades. each group contains several distinct lineages that may represent separate species; the most diversified is the minutoides group. the relationships among species groups are not well resolved, but in most topologies the triton group is non-significantly clustered with three ancient species, while all other species groups cluster together. within the latter, the setulosus group separates the first, and the baoulei group is the sister of the sorella group .figure  <dig>

number of potential species and their distribution
the application of the gmyc model provided the delimitation of  <dig> maximum likelihood entities  based on the ml estimate of speciation-coalescence threshold at  <dig>   mya. figure 3a depicts support for the “intraspecific” basal splits as coalescences as well as support for “interspecific” splits as speciation events. in both cases white circles indicate support <  <dig>  and black circles >  <dig> . low “intraspecific” support suggests there may be more species present, whereas low “interspecific” support suggests the two sister clades may be in fact conspecific populations. where two neighbouring “interspecific” and “intraspecific” supports are low, the speciation-coalescence transition is blurred.figure  <dig>

k2p distances among the gmyc-species  were not overlapping with “intraspecific” distances  . the detailed analysis of geographical distribution of gmyc-species showed that many sister groups among them are parapatric, i.e. most probably representing the results of allopatric differentiation and secondary contacts. for example, in the clade corresponding to m. minutoides in previous studies , the gmyc method delimited  <dig> gmyc-species with prevailing parapatric distribution pattern and with “interspecific” k2p distances  <dig> - <dig> %. using the threshold value of  <dig> %, we grouped these lineages and considered them as phylogeographical differentiation within the single species m. minutoides . using this combined approach , we reduced  <dig> gmyc-species to  <dig> highly supported molecular operational taxonomic units , which are further discussed below. genetic distances among  <dig> motus were always significantly higher and did not overlap with those within motus .

there were  <dig> motus that exactly matched a single gmyc-species,  <dig> of them represented by more than one sequence.  <dig> motus comprised two gmyc-species,  <dig> motus were composed of three gmyc-species and a single motu, motu 27 = m. minutoides, comprised  <dig> gmyc-species . in  <dig> cases, however, there was strong support for the presence of multiple species within a single motu .

below we follow the nomenclature of  <cit>  that recognizes  <dig> valid species. possible names for newly recognized motus are discussed in the text.ancient mountain lineages :



a tri-phyletic group with very restricted distribution ranges. they are known from only a few individuals captured in the highest east african mountains. they were not included in previous phylogenetic studies of nannomys and on the phylogenetic tree they form very long branches, in most topologies they are related to the triton group, but not always with significant nodal support.

 mus sp. “nyika”

it is a very distinct ancient lineage of nannomys, known from a single, relatively large individual , captured in the high plateau of nyika mts. in malawi . albeit partially broken, the cranium of this specimen clearly shows features that are typical for insectivorous rodents, namely proodont  incisors and slender mandibles. this lineage is sympatric with motu  <dig>  and even syntopic with motu  <dig> .

 mus imberbis rüppell, 1842

it is an easily distinguished taxon, very large  and with a black dorsal stripe. it has been considered as a separate genus muriculus, but genetic analysis of a recently captured individual clearly shows that it is an internal lineage of mus  <cit> . it is an endemic species of the high plateaux of ethiopia, known only from a few of individuals .

 mus sp. “harenna”

it is a large species , very probably endemic to the moist harenna forest in the bale mts. in ethiopia, a region with very pronounced endemicity  <cit> . based on morphometry this taxon was previously reported as m. triton  <cit>  and in most topologies it is also the sister taxon to the triton group. genetically it is a very distinct lineage  with a remarkably different karyotype than m. triton  <cit> . earlier studies have already suggested that this taxon represents a valid species  <cit> . it can be sympatric with m. mahomet, but differs in habitat preferences; m. sp. “harenna” lives mostly in the forests, while m. mahomet inhabits more open grassy habitats . the triton group :



it is the group of motus of relatively large body size, distributed mostly south of the equator . genetic data suggest important cryptic variability . only nominotypical motu has a clear valid name, remaining lineages require further taxonomic studies.

 mus triton 

this species was described from mt. elgon in kenya and we provide the sequence from the type locality. it is distributed in the kenyan highlands and northern part of albertine rift. the same species probably occurs in southern sudan also   <cit> ), but this should be confirmed by barcoding sudanese specimens.

 mus sp. “kikwit”

this distinct genetic lineage within the triton group was detected in two localities in south-western democratic republic of congo . it may represent a new species, but more material and analyses are necessary to substantiate this claim. this motu supports important biogeographical distinctiveness of the kikwit region in drc . the type locality of mus callewaerti   is relatively near, so it is possible that they are conspecific, but a comparison with the type material will be necessary before a final conclusion can be reached .

 mus cf. callewaerti

this taxon forms a well-supported separate lineage within the triton group. its distribution range comprises a fairly important area situated between the tanzanian eastern arc mountains, through southern rift mountains and northern zambia till the angolan highlands. in miombo woodlands of north-western tanzania, it may have overlapping distribution ranges with m. triton, but no locality with sympatric occurrence was found in our study. the angolan specimens were recently reported as m. callewaerti   <cit> . it is therefore possible that the whole clade should belong to m. callewaerti, but a comparison with type material will be necessary. the taxon prefers the miombo woodland or montane forest edges. there is important genetic variability within this taxon, with animals from eastern arc mountains forming a distinct clade supported as a separate gmyc-species . the setulosus group :



we recognized five motus within this highly supported monophyletic lineage. it includes relatively large-bodied species, with distribution ranges mostly north of the equator, i.e. largely parapatric with the triton group. two of these motus were only recorded in ethiopia.

 mus cf. proconodon

it represents a lineage probably endemic to ethiopia, where it mainly occurs in lowlands of the rift valley. we suggest assigning this motu to the species m. proconodon rhoads,  <dig>  i.e. the ethiopian taxon that was synonymised with m. setulosus  <cit>  even if genetically it represents the most distinct lineage of the whole setulosus group.

 mus setulosus peters, 1876

this highly supported motu from western-central africa  represents the true m. setulosus . the western border of its distribution likely lies in the dry region of the dahomey gap. in the north-east ), it is probably in contact with m. bufo , and it is worthy of further study to analyse the possible contact zone and reproductive barriers between these two taxa in car.

 mus cf. setulosus “west”

motus 8– <dig> form a monophyletic group of four strongly supported lineages with roughly parapatric distribution . two of them  have been previously named m. setulosus . motu  <dig> is distributed in central african forests, while motu  <dig> in western africa . motus  <dig> and  <dig> represent valid species m. bufo  and m. mahomet rhoads,  <dig>  respectively. the topology and genetic distances  suggest that motus  <dig> and  <dig> should be given different names. because m. setulosus was described from cameroon , we suggest that the west african populations of m. cf. setulosus, i.e. motu  <dig>  may represent a separate new species, but this claim needs to be substantiated by further taxonomic work.

 mus bufo 

the species was described from ruwenzori mts. in uganda and it was considered endemic to the albertine rift. there are few sequences identified as m. bufo in genbank. the first  from bujumbura in burundi was reported by  <cit>  as an incorrectly assigned species. recently, new sequences of m. bufo from kahuzi-biega  were published  <cit>  and all clearly cluster with the new sequences from car, drc and kenya reported in our study. furthermore, we obtained a short sequence from the paratype of m. bufo from drc  that also grouped with this clade. although the morphological comparison with additional type material is necessary, we suggest that m. bufo has a much larger distribution range than previously assumed. this taxon may also involve additional populations of the setulosus group from eastern africa, especially those assigned to m. emesi heller,  <dig> , and m. pasha thomas,  <dig> .

 mus mahomet rhoads, 1896

it is an abundant species with a distribution range restricted to the ethiopian plateau. we provide the first sequences of this taxon, confirming its position within the setulosus group as a strongly supported monophyletic lineage. we therefore support the view of  <cit> , who considered m. mahomet as an ethiopian endemic, contrary to previous opinions merging it with kenyan and ugandan populations . the baoulei group :



this is a west african clade, until now known as a single species, but with very pronounced divergences between two subclades  that have partially overlapping distribution ranges in ghana and ivory coast. only very limited genetic data are available, because the species of the baoulei group are probably rare or difficult to capture  <cit> . the species of this group occur in the forest-savannah ecotone and are generally larger than other west african species   <cit> . the baoulei group is a sister lineage to the sorella group , which is also reflected in morphology  <cit> .

 mus baoulei 

the species m. baoulei was described from lamto in the ivory coast  <cit> . two individuals sequenced from the type locality  <cit>  belong to the genetic clade that is distributed mainly in ghana, benin and western nigeria .

 mus cf. baoulei “west”

specimens from this lineage were found in guinea and single individuals were sequenced from the eastern ivory coast  <cit>  and ghana  <cit> . future more-detailed studies  are required to resolve whether motus  <dig> and  <dig> represent separate species. the sorella group :



it is a lineage of relatively large animals living in the congo basin’s forest-savannah transit zones, but also reported from south-eastern africa   <cit> . while very limited genetic data are available, our sampling shows very divergent sequences that may represent up to four species, but more data are required for taxonomic revision of this group.

 mus sp. “dakawa”

two sequences from dakawa  belong to the m. sorella group, but they are very distinct from other lineages of the group . it is possible that they represent a new species, but more taxonomic research is necessary. there is an existing name, m. wamae, that may be valid for this motu. this taxon was described as a member of the sorella group from the kapiti plains in southern kenya  <cit> .

 mus sp. “koi river”

a single specimen from the moist savannah area near koi river in south-western ethiopia clearly belongs to the sorella group, but is very divergent at cytb . further taxonomic work is necessary to resolve the taxonomic rank of this lineage. this is the first record of the sorella group in ethiopia.

 mus sorella 

the first sequence of this motu was published under the name m. sorella by  <cit>  from sangba . the species m. sorella was described from hills around mt. elgon, an area which has clear biogeographical connections to car . we obtained one additional short sequence from this lineage by  <dig> pyrosequencing of a museum specimen from the garamba national park in north-eastern drc, thus connecting sangba with the type locality. however, it is also possible that these sequences represent another currently valid species described from car, i.e. m. oubanguii petter & genest,  <dig> or m. goundae petter & genest,  <dig>  more samples and detailed analyses are required to resolve this taxonomic problem.

 mus neavei 

even if more morphological comparisons are necessary, hereafter we call this south-east african clade m. neavei and we report the first sequences of this species. the type locality of m. neavei  is petauke, zambia. in our material, this taxon is distributed in hilly areas of southern tanzania, malawi and one locality in zambia . it occurs in sympatry with motu  <dig> from the triton group  <cit>  and in the nyika mountains in malawi also with motu  <dig>  the records from south african republic  are not yet confirmed genetically; the specimen mentioned by  <cit>  was finally identified as m. minutoides and no other sequences of m. neavei were obtained despite intensive recent sampling efforts in sar  the minutoides group :



this is the most diversified group within nannomys, inhabiting various, mostly open habitats of sub-saharan africa. it harbours the real “pygmy” mice, i.e. the rodents with the smallest body size . most previous published genetic studies of nannomys mainly targeted representatives of this group. our phylogenetic analysis reveals three clear subgroups: subgroup  <dig> , subgroup  <dig> , and subgroup  <dig> .

 mus sp. “zakouma”

a single specimen of this taxon was captured in the zakouma national park in south-eastern chad  <cit> . it is genetically very distinct from its sister species, m. mattheyi f. petter,  <dig> and m. haussa , and further taxonomic work on more material from southern chad may confirm it as a new distinct species. together with m. mattheyi and m. haussa, this species forms a monophyletic group that diverged in west african savannahs.

 mus haussa 

it is a sahelian taxon, recorded in the belt from senegal to western chad  <cit> . similarly as in m. mattheyi and other west african savannah species of rodents  <cit> , there is also indication of longitudinal genetic structure in m. haussa, but more detailed data are needed for more conclusive phylogeographical inferences.

m. mattheyi is typical species of guinean savannah-forest mosaic from westernmost africa  to the dahomey gap, the relatively dry region separating guinean and congolese forest blocks  <cit> . it is divided into western and eastern phylogeographic subclades with a presumable contact zone in the ivory coast . it is often the most abundant nannomys in the rodent assemblages  <cit> .

 mus cf. kasaicus

two sequenced individuals from the kikwit region  formed this genetically very distinct genetic motu. there are also indications from other rodent groups that the kikwit area is a local centre of endemism . there is an existing name, m. kasaicus , described from kasaï occidental province, kananga, drc, for the taxon belonging morphologically to m. minutoides group  <cit> , that may apply to this motu.

 mus indutus 

m. indutus is a south african species, found in a relatively large area from northern botswana to southern sar  <cit> . records from zambia and malawi are based on genotyping of old museum material  <cit>  and should be taken with caution. it is probably sympatric with m. minutoides smith,  <dig>  in most of its distribution range.

 mus cf. gratus

specimens from this taxon were typically captured in forest clearings and the ecotone between forest and open habitats in equatorial africa. there are three distinct clades with clear west–east geographical structure:  a single specimen from lowland tropical forest in congo ;  the kisangani region in drc; and  both montane and lowland tropical forests in southern kenya and northern tanzania. more taxonomic work is necessary to link this clade to an existing species; possibly m. gratus , a taxon from the minutoides group described from eastern ruwenzori, “upper congo” and virunga mountains. again, the comparison with the types will be required to verify this hypothesis.

 mus cf. gerbillus

this taxon is distributed in dry somali-maasai savannah in kenya and tanzania. in all phylogenetic analyses, it is a sister clade to the ethiopian motu  <dig> . further taxonomic work is necessary, but m. gerbillus   is an available name that may apply to this lineage.

 mus cf. tenellus

this lineage was found at two close localities in northern ethiopia - in hagere selam and in the mekelle university campus. it may represent true m. tenellus  described from blue nile in sudan, but the comparison with the type material is necessary. on the contrary, morphological studies of museum material suggested that most published ethiopian records of m. tenellus were actually m. minutoides  <cit> .

 mus musculoides temminck, 1853

it is a typical species of the sudanian savannah belt. it was previously reported from western africa  <cit>  and northern cameroon  <cit> . we provide a new very distant record from western ethiopia, representing the easternmost genetically confirmed locality of the species. very probably it is also present in poorly sampled countries such as chad, northern car and south sudan.

 mus minutoides smith, 1834

m. minutoides is a widely distributed species in most of sub-saharan africa . this motu also includes specimens from southern ethiopia; some of them were previously called m. tenellus  <cit> . this species has a very strong intraspecific phylogeographical structure. median-joining network analysis of  <dig> sequences from this motu resulted in  <dig> haplotypes that form  <dig> strongly delimited haplogroups . the mean k2p-corrected distances among haplogroups ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . all haplogroups are connected in the form of a star, suggesting multiple synchronous vicariance events. allopatric divergences with subsequent expansions are further supported by current parapatric distribution of most clades and frequent, but narrow, secondary contacts among them . the geographic structure within individual haplogroups is relatively weak, except clade se, where it is possible to distinguish the separate sublineages from south africa , mozambique  and tanzania . two haplogroups are only represented by animals from single localities , but it is possible that they are more widespread in neighbouring regions in eastern drc, where the relevant samples are missing.figure  <dig>

divergence dating
the basal split of the extant nannomys was dated at  <dig>  mya with 95% of the highest posterior density  between  <dig> – <dig>  mya. successive divergence of the extant major species groups then took place throughout pliocene, with median estimates of divergence times ranging from  <dig>  mya  to  <dig>  mya, i.e. the divergence of motu  <dig>  and motus 24– <dig>  . posterior estimates of divergence dates at the calibration points are shifted towards past in the case of apodemus  and arvicanthis-otomys  but towards the present in the case of mus . two other divergence dates are also worth noting: the split-off of myomyscus yemeni estimated at  <dig>   mya, which is consistent with its migration to arabian peninsula across the land bridge during the messinian crisis, and the origin of modern otomys  <dig>   mya, first appearing in the fossil record around  <dig> mya . complete results of the divergence dating analysis are reported in additional file  <dig> 

the full set of branching times between  <dig> motus is given in figure 3a. it is based on the secondary dating of the ultrametric tree for gmyc, but the posterior estimates of divergence dates are consistent with previous analysis . main species lineages diverged in lower pliocene  and an intensive period of speciation is also visible in the lower pleistocene , when many extant lineages within main species groups appeared.

biogeographical analysis
bayesian analysis of discrete traits in beast revealed that the most ancestral distribution  of nannomys included mountains of eastern africa . this type of distribution is currently present in all three ancient monotypic lineages , as well as in numerous lineages of the triton and setulosus groups. there are two major habitat shifts in the nannomys evolution.  the lineage leading to the baoulei group colonized the forests  in western africa cca  <dig> mya, where it split to western and eastern sublineages later on;  the minutoides group descended from mountains, adapted to more arid open habitats, and started to radiate across the whole sub-saharan africa cca  <dig>  mya. in the first radiation phase, motus 18– <dig> speciated in savannah-like habitats over all of africa . geographically similar, but much more recent  radiation occurred inside motu  <dig>  i.e. m. minutoides .

very similar results were obtained by the maximum likelihood approach in lagrange . most basal splits occurred with the highest probability in the mountains of east africa, also where most of the motus from the triton group diverged. the first clear shifts to other habitats are visible in the ancestors of the baoulei group  and in the ancestors of the minutoides group . the most intensive radiation in the latter took place in savannahs, with one shift to the forest habitat detected in motu  <dig> . the estimates of ancestral ranges are less clear in the setulosus and the sorella groups. while the former started to diverge most probably in mountains , the latter had ancestors occurring with similar support either in savannahs or in hills of eastern africa.

discussion
for the purpose of our study, we compiled new and existing sequences into the largest genetic dataset to date of the subgenus nannomys and performed the first phylogenetic analysis of the group that contains most of the currently recognized valid species across the whole sub-saharan africa. we detected a surprisingly high amount of cryptic diversity, with numerous candidates for new species. wide geographical sampling also allowed the first empirical definition of the distribution areas of all the detected lineages based on physically present genotyped individuals. using several calibration points and the current distributional data, we also carried out biogeographical analysis and reconstructed the possible evolutionary scenario of this highly successful group of sub-saharan murines.

species concepts and estimation of the number of nannomys species
species diversity crucially depends on the adopted species concept. widely used concepts of typological or biological species are not always applicable for species delimitation because of frequent convergent evolution, cryptic species, and the impossibility of proving reproductive isolation among allopatric populations. together with the rapidly increasing amount of genetic data from free-living populations, these concepts are often complemented by genetic  <cit>  or phylogenetic  <cit>  species concepts, creating the so-called integrative taxonomic approach. although genetic approaches can sometimes lead to an unjustified increase in the number of species , they often detect cryptic diversity within evolutionary lineages that can be generally important from the taxonomic as well as conservation point of view. in our study, we used the combination of maximum likelihood delimitation of phylogenetic species and the genetic distances to estimate the number of motus  of nannomys in africa. we are aware of the drawbacks of these approaches , however, our aim was not to perform the taxonomic changes based solely on limited genetic data, but rather to identify the taxa and regions of high cryptic diversity requiring more detailed taxonomic studies.

the combination of different approaches revealed the existence of  <dig> motus. this is considerably more than the  <dig> currently accepted nannomys species  <cit> , suggesting that numerous putative species have so far remained undetected, and therefore undescribed. most of the genetic data of nannomys that have been collected to date originate from western and southern africa, where the taxonomy of this group has been intensively explored . the number of candidates for potential new species in western africa revealed by our study is therefore relatively low  and it is also possible that these motus just represent marked phylogeographical structure of within-species lineages with parapatric distribution .

the situation is completely different in eastern africa, from where only fragmentary genetic data were available prior to this study. our results may lead to the description of more than  <dig> new species that are already now sufficiently delimited using the combination of genetic, ecological and geographic data. many of these so far undescribed taxa occur in mountains or highland habitats, but a few other potential new species  are typical inhabitants of dry savannahs. the taxonomic diversity of nannomys is probably the highest in ethiopia. as for many other organisms, the ethiopian highlands represent an important hot-spot of african endemism for mus. we have revealed the presence of  <dig> motus in this country, and only two of them  have also been recorded outside ethiopia. the six remaining species are probably endemic, making mus the genus with the second highest number of ethiopian mammal endemics .

even if we have not sequenced the type material of most currently valid taxa , we have been able to assign the most probable species names to 13– <dig> motus based on previous genetic studies , geographical distribution  and external morphology. therefore, the genetic dataset from this study represents a solid basis for future identification of morphologically similar nannomys species via dna barcoding . unfortunately, our dataset lacks sequences of four valid species. m. oubanguii peter & genest,  <dig> and m. goundae peter & genest,  <dig> represent two species from the sorella group known only from few localities in the central african republic. they were described mainly on the basis of external morphology  <cit>  and their specific status has been questioned previously . the whole sorella group requires a profound revision including new sampling in savannahs north of the congo basin and additional genetic data. we found high genetic variation within the sorella group, but most clades are represented by only one or two localities  and in most cases it is not possible to assign the particular clades to currently valid species names. m. setzeri petter,  <dig> is a rare taxon with limited distribution in dry areas of namibia, botswana and western zambia  <cit> ; it is probably a valid species as it can be morphologically distinguished from sympatric nannomys species  <cit> . m. orangiae roberts,  <dig> is the fourth species that is currently valid and missing from our dataset. it also is a southern african species with unclear taxonomical status. it was previously considered a subspecies of either m. setzeri or m. minutoides  <cit>  and may just represent one of the cytotypes of the latter  <cit> .

phylogenetic estimate of species richness of nannomys in our study  suggests that it is one of the most speciose groups of african terrestrial mammals. similarly well studied species-rich genera of african rodents usually have a lower number of monophyletic genetic lineages considered as species, e.g. praomys  or hylomyscus . the only genus with higher described species richness is lophuromys . however, this genus is specialized to tropical forests and ecotones and it is likely that intensive genetic drift in fragmented forest habitats  caused morphological distinctiveness allowing differentiation of a high number of genetically similar morphospecies  <cit> . it is also worth to note that in comparison with the above-mentioned genera, nannomys colonized a much wider spectrum of habitats .

mus minutoides as a model for pan-african phylogeography
the motu with the largest distribution of all nannomys is m. minutoides . there are only a very few such widespread savannah-forest mosaic species distributed across almost complete sub-saharan africa. among rodents, only the ubiquitous mastomys natalensis had held this habitat breadth, and it was considered the rodent species with the largest distribution area in africa  <cit> . our genetic data confirm that m. minutoides has very similar and probably even larger distribution than m. natalensis. it can be argued that motu  <dig> does not represent a single species but rather a species complex, which may be supported by the gmyc analysis revealing significant support for additional speciation events within this clade . however, in absence of more detailed evidence, we prefer to maintain all genetic lineages of motu  <dig> within the species m. minutoides. they do not show visible external differences , they radiated relatively recently  and the tamura-nei corrected genetic distances among clades  are comparable with those among clades of m. natalensis , i.e. much lower than usual genetic distances between sister species of rodents  <cit> . further detailed studies should focus on the contact zones of divergent clades to reveal whether they can interbreed or not.

species with large distributions and strong affinities to open habitats can serve as possible models for comparative pan-african phylogeography of the savannah-like biomes. recent phylogeographic studies of m. natalensis showed that populations were strongly influenced by pleistocene climate fluctuations  <cit> . the presence of genetically divergent clades with parapatric distribution is congruent with the scenario invoking allopatric fragmentation and vicariance. almost the exact same geographic pattern of genetic differentiation is visible in m. minutoides . the phylogeographic pattern suggests at least  <dig> different savannah refugia approximately  <dig> mya, i.e. in the period of very strong climatic instability  <cit> ). the genetic lineages evolved in allopatry and subsequently spread during suitable periods of savannah expansion. further research should focus on precise localization of refugia by combining information from population genetics with modelling of past ecological conditions  <cit> ).

a new biogeographical scenario of nannomys radiation in africa - from mountains to lowland forests, savannahs and arid sahelian environments
more complete taxon sampling from the whole sub-saharan africa now allows significant modification and increased precision of the previously proposed biogeographical scenario of nannomys radiation in africa  <cit> . our molecular dating based on plausible paleontological calibration and taxon-unbiased phylogenetic tree suggests that the divergence of the genus mus to the current subgenera occurred in asia in the late miocene , which is in good agreement with previous studies  <cit> . the colonization of africa by mus occurred very probably in the messinian period  when the temporary land bridge connected africa and southwest arabia. in this period, many faunal exchanges between africa and asia are well documented  <cit> . it is therefore highly probable that mus was already in africa at the beginning of the pliocene. the basic split of the extant nannomys was dated at  <dig>  mya , i.e. very soon after a land bridge between africa and southwest arabia disappeared . the oldest fossil evidence of the genus mus in africa was from the early to middle pliocene in ethiopia  and kenya .

due to incomplete sampling  previous studies could not adequately explore the evolutionary history of nannomys, especially since our biogeographical reconstructions demonstrate that the first divergence of nannomys occurred in eastern africa. paleoclimatic and paleoanthropological research in eastern africa suggested repeated association of critical events in hominin evolution with the most prolonged intervals of high climate variability. potts   <cit>  defined eight intervals of predicted high climate variability in the last  <dig> my and argued that most important events in hominin evolution occurred within these periods. three of the most prolonged intervals of predicted high climate variability are  <dig> - <dig>  ma,  <dig> - <dig>  ma, and  <dig> - <dig>  ma and they largely overlap with the previously defined periods of the occurrence of large lakes  <cit>  as well as with inferred aridity phases based on dust records, paleosol δ13c, and the prevalence of grazing bovids  <cit> .

clear associations between periods of climatic instability and divergence events are also visible in phylogenetic reconstructions of nannomys. the first splits leading to ancestors of most current species groups probably occurred in eastern africa in the period  <dig> - <dig>  mya , which corresponds to the longest era of strong wet-dry variability  <cit> . nothing is known about the ecology of the extinct mus taxa, but surviving ancient lineages  may provide some clues. they can be considered “living fossils”, i.e. monotypic relict taxa living in very restricted areas in eastern african mountains. the period 4– <dig>  mya is considered relatively stable with few documented evolutionary events  <cit>  and we observed only two vicariance events in nannomys during this period. the first is the north–south split of motu  <dig>  and the triton group, and the second is the west–east split of the baoulei and the sorella groups . the most intensive radiation of nannomys is dated into the period  <dig> - <dig>  mya , when most current motus  appeared. the beginning of this period coincides with the start of a cooling and aridification trend  <cit> . the open savannah-like habitats were spreading intensively and at the same time the climate was very variable . this variable climate likely yielded environmental changes that increased the frequency of evolutionary responses like adaptation, dispersal , and ultimately, speciation . our biogeographic analyses are consistent with these findings because the most intensive radiation occurred in the minutoides lineage in savannahs. the presumed shift from mountains to more arid and open habitats was clearly linked with the decrease of the body size in the minutoides lineage. the ancient m. imberbis  has a body size of 25 g  <cit> , motu  <dig>  has 14 g, motu  <dig>  has cca 16 g  and the members of other non-minutoides groups weight 8–13 g  <cit> . in contrast, all species of the minutoides clade have body size 3–8 g, making them one of the smallest mammals in the world  <cit> . the last period of climatic instability is dated to  <dig> - <dig>  mya, which coincides with the likely simultaneous split of the motu  <dig>  i.e. mus minutoides, into  <dig> distinct genetic lineages .

ecological constraints and multi-species sympatry
previous studies revealed that at several sites more than one species of nannomys occurs in sympatry  <cit> . their observations are in agreement with the distribution ranges based on genotyped individuals  showing largely overlapping distribution areas of many species. however, if we exclude widely distributed m. minutoides , the distribution of individual species within the same species group is predominantly parapatric , while sympatry is typical for species from different species groups. this suggests that the species groups might have evolved specific morphological adaptations that allow their sympatric occurrence with the members of other nannomys lineages. although detailed morphological analysis of genetically identified specimens is still missing, preliminary data suggest clear differences in the skull morphology among the species groups , with possible functional consequences in separation of ecological niches .

even if the distribution areas of two or more species from the same species group overlap, closer examination of our data provide evidence for the preference of different habitats. for example two ethiopian endemics from the setulosus group, m. cf. proconodon  and m. mahomet , have never been captured at the same locality; the former prefers lowland habitats in the rift valley, while the latter is common species across the ethiopian highlands. up to four species of the minutoides group can be found in western africa, but their ecological requirements are probably different. based on the data summarized at figure  <dig> and published records, it seems that m. minutoides is able to live in western africa in relatively humid places, m. mattheyi prefers dry guinean savannah and the transition zone between forest and savannah, m. musculoides is a typical inhabitant of sudanian savannah belt from guinea to western ethiopia and m. haussa lives in arid sahelian environment . similarly m. minutoides can occasionally be found in the same localities as m. indutus in southern africa, but the latter probably prefers drier habitats .

relevance to the understanding of karyotype evolution and sex determination
the subgenus nannomys has previously been used as a suitable model for studies of karyotype evolution due to very high variability of chromosomal rearrangements  <cit> . the ancestral karyotype of the pygmy mice was composed of  <dig> acrocentric chromosomes  <cit> , but the wide spectrum of mutational mechanisms modified the chromosomal constitution. besides relatively frequent robertsonian translocations, other chromosomal rearrangements were described in nannomys, including variable sex-autosome translocations, pericentric inversions, tandem fusions and warts   <cit> . pan-african phylogeny based on more complete taxon sampling presented in our study can help to understand the karyotype evolution in general and sex determination mechanisms in particular. the mapping of karyotype features on the phylogenetic tree can help to define specific predictions that can be further verified by sampling focussed on particular species and geographical areas.

for example, tandem fusions - one of the rarest chromosomal rearrangements - were evidenced in m. triton  and m. sp. “harenna”  that in most phylogenies cluster together. even if they were suspected in two other species of the sorella group in the car , further detailed studies of these rare mutations should direct their focus on widely distributed and common motu  <dig> belonging to the triton group. one of the most conspicuous features of nannomys karyotypes is the fusions of autosomes and sex-chromosomes. these fusions were most frequently studied in two terminal taxa of the minutoides group , but they were also observed in m. goundae and m. oubangui  and in m. triton   <cit> . since they appeared several times independently, it is therefore clear that predispositions for translocations of sex chromosomes exist in more lineages of nannomys, yet these translocations are not a general feature of the whole subgenus, as, for example the setulosus group is very conservative and all motus karyotyped until today have the ancestral karyotype  . future research on east african species of the minutoides group , the sorella group and the triton group could thus potentially bring interesting new insights on the evolution and polymorphism of sex-autosome translocations. finally, the phylogeographic pattern described in our study for the most karyotypically variable species, m. minutoides, can help to design further sampling of chromosomal data in lineages, where the karyotypes are not yet known. the haplotype network suggests  <dig> main lineages that probably differentiated in small allopatric populations at the same time, which could have led to establishment and fixation of important karyotypic differences  <cit> ), possibly involving presently unknown means of sex determination  <cit> . if such karyotype differences among genetic lineages exist, it would be also extremely interesting to study the possible contact zones among them .

consequences for future epidemiological studies
rodents are reservoir hosts of important human pathogens, of which some can cause serious diseases. most recent examples of emerging and re-emerging diseases have been caused by rna viruses  <cit>  and understanding of their evolution and epidemiology is essential for predicting future emergences and designing interventions . among rna viruses hosted primarily by african rodents, the lassa arenavirus has received most attention, because it is responsible for lassa hemorrhagic fever in west africa, which causes thousands of human deaths each year  <cit> . the host specificity of arenaviruses is thought to be relatively strict with often a single species described as the primary reservoir host  <cit> . a long-term evolutionary history between arenaviruses and their hosts  was originally suggested due to the almost perfect sorting of arenavirus lineages into rodent clades . recent studies suggest that pygmy mice are frequent hosts of arenaviruses  and they often live close to human habitations . the pan-african phylogeny of nannomys proposed in this paper can help to describe the co-evolutionary patterns of arenaviruses and their hosts and even provide the potential clues for understanding the occasional disease outbreaks.

the first virus found in nannomys was the virus kodoko, described from mus minutoides in western africa, and belonging to the lineage of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus  that is hosted by the house mouse  <cit> . this finding  thus supported a co-evolutionary scenario, because all arenaviruses known from african murine hosts at that time grouped according to taxonomic position of theirs hosts . however, the next arenavirus, called gbagroube and described from mus cf. setulosus  from the ivory coast, does not belong to the lcmv lineage , but surprisingly clusters with the lassa virus strains  <cit> . very recently, two other arenaviruses were found in nannomys in ghana  <cit> . the virus natorduori is hosted by m. mattheyi  and clusters clearly into mus-specific lcmv lineage. in contrast, the virus jirandogo, the first arenavirus reported from m. baoulei, in various phylogenies based on its different genome segments belongs to the lassa virus group . african pygmy mice are therefore the first group of african rodents that host two very different lineages of arenaviruses; one of them seems to be mus-specific , but the second forms the sister lineage of the highly pathogenic lassa virus . further surveillance for new arenaviruses focussed preferentially on nannomys lineages where no viruses have yet been found  can increase understanding of the evolution of these pathogens and predict the regions of possible epidemiological importance.

CONCLUSIONS
the known species diversity of tropical organisms is highly underestimated even for relatively well known animals like mammals. here we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the largest available set of genetic data collected from the only indigenous african lineage of the genus mus, called nannomys. a conservative definition of motus suggests that the number of species described to date represents only approximately 60% of possible species diversity and intensive taxonomic work is now required to allow the formal description of genetically divergent lineages. we also provide the first reliable genotype-based distribution ranges of particular motus that can aid in future species inventories in different parts of africa. the dating of divergences and biogeographical analyses strongly suggest that ancestors of nannomys colonized africa at the end of miocene and diverged to ancestors of the main species groups in mountains of eastern africa in lower pliocene. the aridification that started in africa cca  <dig> mya led to spreading of open habitats and provided new ecological niches that were fully utilized by nannomys. in particular, the so-called minutoides lineage underwent an exceptionally intensive radiation in savannah-like habitats and occupied almost whole sub-saharan africa in several colonization waves. the combination of a detailed phylogeny based on an almost complete taxon sampling combined with genotype-based distributional data of lineages, taxa and valid species provides a solid foundation to address specific ecologically-explicit evolutionary hypotheses using nannomys as a model system, i.e. in evolution of sex determination and host-virus co-evolution.
