BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is important for gene regulation and is a major source of proteome diversity in mammals  <cit>  through altering the composition of mrna transcripts by including or excluding specific exons  <cit> . as can further modulate organism complexity not only by effectively increasing regulatory and signaling network complexity, but also by doing so in a temporal- and spatial-specific manner, supporting cell differentiation, developmental pathways, and other processes associated with multicellular organisms. indeed, as shows a strong relationship with organism complexity, as estimated by the organism’s number of different cell types  <cit> . the recent encode project concluded that at least 90 % of human genes express multiple mrnas through alternative splicing of exons or exon segments  <cit> . as might be expected, deregulation of this process is associated with numerous diseases .

bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  are adult stem cells capable of self-renewal and differentiation into numerous cell lineages, including osteocytes, adipocytes, and chondrocytes  <cit> . one promising use of bmscs is repair of ischemia-damaged cardiac tissue. bmscs are easy to expand in vitro, can be genetically modified and exhibit significant immunotolerance properties , making bmscs an attractive candidate for tissue repair/regeneration therapy. intramyocardial injection of bmscs reduces inflammation, fibrosis, infarct size, ventricular remodeling, and therefore, improves cardiac function following tissue insult .

because the majority of bmscs are soon lost during after injection, the observed therapeutic effects likely derive from paracrine effects of bioactive molecules released from these cells  <cit> . indeed, bmsc-mediated release of cytoprotective protein factors or transfer of intracellular components  via cell membrane exosomes, represents a novel mechanism of cell-to-cell communication  <cit> . to date, however, clinical trials have demonstrated that while effective, delivery of bmscs to ischemic myocardium results in only modest and short-lived benefits  <cit> . therefore, there is a critical need to elucidate the mechanisms by which bmscs mediate their therapeutic benefits, including identification of their specific paracrine factor, and conditions under which their functions can be optimized.

upon injection into damaged heart tissue, bmscs face a hypoxic, ischemic environment that severely limits their therapeutic efficacy. thus, preconditioning bmscs with various growth factors and endogenous or exogenous molecules has been used to improve bmsc therapeutic efficacy . indeed, it has been reported previously that bacterial endotoxin  could stimulate bmscs to release paracrine factors, including angiogenic growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines that facilitate tissue repair  <cit> . in addition, our previous study suggested that bmsc expression of the lps receptor, toll-like receptor  <dig> , regulates bmsc paracrine properties and intracellular stat <dig> signaling cascades  <cit> . moreover, preconditioning of bmscs with lps improves their therapeutic efficacy in rodent models of ischemia/reperfusion injury  <cit> . however, bmsc transcriptomic changes  that occur following lps stimulation have been little studied.

besides use as an attractive therapeutic tool for repairing ischemic heart, bmscs have been used for numerous other diseases, including graft-versus-host disease, crohn’s disease, stroke, cartilage defects, diabetes and many others . with the growing incidence of bacterial endotoxin lps detected in older or immunocompromised patients with multiple-drug resistant bacteria, diabetes, cancer, indwelling iv catheters, and on complex chemotherapy regimens  <cit> , it is of great importance to study whether the stimulation of these implanted bmscs by endogenous lps would alter their therapeutic efficacy. moreover, because mscs are present in bone marrow and many other tissues, it merits extensive investigation whether lps stimulation of these endogenous mscs would influence the clinical outcomes of complex therapeutic regimens.

despite bmsc’s strong clinical potential, the role of alternative splicing in lps response has not been fully explored. the recent development of high-throughput sequencing technology has now made transcriptome-wide profiling of splicing isoforms possible. in this study, we used rna-seq analysis of bmscs to identify and characterize gene transcripts whose splicing patterns were altered by lps treatment.

RESULTS
to investigate lps-induced transcriptomic changes in bmscs due to alternative splicing, rna-seq analysis was conducted on bmscs before and after lps treatment, in triplicate. a strand-directed single-end rna-seq protocol  was used with the solid 5500xl instrument.

the total analysis resulted in  <dig> million reads, with each of the six samples ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> million reads. after removing the reads with low sequencing quality  and filtering reads mapped to ribosomal rnas and repeats, the remaining reads were mapped to the standard mouse reference genome . the total number of mappable reads in each sample ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> million, with an average mapping percentage of 59 %. among the mappable reads in each sample,  <dig>  to  <dig>  million are mapped to protein coding exons, and  <dig>  to  <dig>  million are mapped to splice junctions. detailed mapping statistics for the six samples are listed in additional file  <dig> 

lps-induced alternative splicing
we applied a miso  algorithm  <cit>  to identify alternative splicing events elicited by lps treatment. based on a bayesian inference framework, miso is a probabilistic framework that quantitates the expression levels of alternatively spliced genes from rna-seq data, and identifies differentially regulated exons across samples. miso computes percent spliced in  values for each alternative splicing event, representing the fraction of a gene’s mrna that includes the exon. for each event, miso also calculates a bayesian factor  that quantifies the likelihood of the changes. for instance,  =  <dig> indicates it is five times more likely that a specific alternative splicing event occurred than did not occur.

overall, we identified  <dig> exons whose splicing patterns differed between control and lps-treated bmscs . this number represents  <dig>  % of all  <dig>  events whose inclusion percentages could be reliably measured from the rna-seq data; these genes generally had higher expression levels to generate enough read depth for splicing analysis. for genes with lower expression levels, our rna-seq experiment did not have enough read depth for such analysis. the  <dig> lps-induced alternatively spliced events included  <dig> cassette exons,  <dig> alternative donor site events ,  <dig> alternative acceptor site events , and  <dig> intron retention events. figure  <dig> demonstrates the magnitude  and significance  of lps-induced splicing pattern changes on all the alternatively exons that could be reliably identified by miso under both untreated and lps-treated conditions . among these  <dig> events ,  <dig> showed positive ∆Ψ values, indicating that the percentage of transcripts containing the specific exon increased in the lps-treated samples compared to control samples. similarly,  <dig> events showed negative ∆Ψ values, indicating a decrease in the percentage of transcripts containing specific exons. for each of the four types of splicing events , we show one sashimi plot for the exons with the largest lps-induced changes  in percentage of inclusion in the gene product . the sashimi plot demonstrates the rna-seq read densities along exons and junctions, in the context of the structure of the gene’s isoforms. in addition, the distribution and the confidence intervals of the estimated Ψ under both conditions  are also included.fig.  <dig> lps-induced alternative splicing events. scatter plot of all the as events identified in miso. the x-axis represents ∆Ψ, and the y-axis represents log . the shape of the dots indicates the type of the events. specifically, circle indicates cassette exon events; star indicates intron retention events; triangle indicates alternative 5′ splice site events; and diamond indicates alternative 3′ splice site events. alternatively spliced events with bf ≥  <dig> are colored in red

to validate whether the alternative splicing events were induced by lps treatment, we performed rna-seq on bmscs derived from myd88−/− animals before and after lps treatment. myd <dig> is a key signaling molecule responsible for lps response  <cit> . among the  <dig> lps-induced alternative splicing events in wild-type bmscs,  <dig> did not occur following lps treatment of myd88−/− bmscs . this observation indicates that a large majority of bmsc splicing changes were a direct consequence of lps induction, and such effects were negated in cells whose lps response is compromised. it should be noted that in addition to myd <dig> pathways, lps also functions through trif pathways  <cit> ; the functions of trif pathway is intact in the myd88−/− cells. this partially explains why some lps-induced splicing effects remained in myd88-deficient animals.fig.  <dig> lps-induced splicing changes in wild-type bmsc were repressed in myd88−/− cells. the x-axis and y-axis represents ∆psi in wild type and myd <dig> knock out animals respectively. blue diamond represents lps induced as events in wild type only, and red square represents lps induced as events in both wild type and myd <dig> knock-out cells



among the  <dig> lps-induced alternative splicing events,  <dig> were located in the coding regions of transcripts, and  <dig> were either in the 5′- or 3′- untranslated regions . among the  <dig> alternatively spliced coding events,  <dig> were composed of multiples of three nucleotides, leading to the inclusion or exclusion of specific amino-acid residues in the final protein products. these events could potentially generate multiple viable protein products having the same translation frame. thirty-eight of the  <dig> coding exons contained either a premature stop codon, and/or a shift in their translation frames. such events trigger either nonsense-mediated decay  mechanisms  <cit> , or a translated protein having a complete different amino acid sequence downstream of the alternatively spliced exon.

we then systematically examined the localization and functions of the gene products possessing alternatively spliced exons . among them,  <dig> were nuclear proteins, including  <dig> transcription regulators,  <dig> enzymes,  <dig> kinases,  <dig> peptidase, and  <dig> ligand-dependent nuclear receptor. the  <dig> cytoplasmic alternatively spliced gene products included  <dig> enzymes,  <dig> kinases,  <dig> transporters,  <dig> peptidases, and  <dig> translation regulators. in addition, we also observed six potentially secreted proteins and  <dig> plasma membrane-spanning proteins. a detailed list of the genes in each category is provided in additional file  <dig>  these results strongly suggest that lps induces splicing changes in highly diverse proteins having a variety of cellular functions.fig.  <dig> distribution of as genes in different cellular locations



to understand the biological functions of genes whose splicing patterns were altered by lps treatment, we conducted functional annotation analysis using the database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery  v <dig>   <cit> . three functional terms in the sp_pir  category showed significant enrichment in our gene list. among the  <dig> genes that could be mapped to david gene annotations,  <dig> categorized as phosphoproteins . in addition,  <dig> genes contained zinc finger domain proteins  whose functions range from dna or rna binding to protein-protein interactions and membrane association  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> genes were involved in protein acetylation . together, these results suggest that lps treatment has major effects on the splicing patterns of signaling proteins.

both gene expression levels and splicing patterns may be altered by bmsc responses to lps treatment. while differential gene expression may lead to changes in the abundance of the entire gene product, alternative spicing modifies the structural composition of a specific protein. to evaluate to what extent the two mechanisms interact, we examined the number of genes present in both differentially expressed and alternatively spliced gene sets. we utilized edger  <cit>  to identify genes differentially expressed between lps-treated and control samples. in total,  <dig> differentially expressed genes were identified using a false discovery rate ≤  <dig> . surprisingly, only one gene, plscr <dig>  was both differentially expressed and alternatively spliced. the expression level of plscr <dig> increased  <dig> -fold in lps-induced samples with fdr =  <dig> , while the percentage of inclusion of one cassette exon in the 3′-untranslated region  increased by  <dig> .

known protein domains are alternatively spliced in lps-induced transcripts
alternatively spliced exons residing in known protein domains are more likely to disrupt protein function. therefore, we systematically searched the overlap between lps-induced as events for known protein family domains documented in the pfam database  <cit> . among  <dig> alternatively spliced exons that did not disrupt codon frame, seven overlapped with known protein domains . in addition, seven other known domains that overlapped flanking exons had functions ranging from rna and protein binding, enzymatic activities, methyltransferase activity, phosphopantetheinyl transferase activity, rna editing, and microrna processing.table  <dig> alternatively spliced genes containing known protein domains



alternative splicing in known protein domains may affect protein-protein interactions
to examine whether alternatively spliced protein domains modulate protein-protein interactions, we searched for their binding partners based on two criteria:  at least one experimental study supporting direct interaction between the partner protein and the alternatively spliced protein in a known protein-protein interaction network  <cit> ; and  at least one structural study in the protein data bank  supporting direct interaction between a domain in the binding partner and the domain modified by alternative splicing. for the first criterion, we merged two datasets of experimentally validated direct interactions  <cit>  and compiled a library of  <dig>  protein-coding genes with  <dig>  experimentally validated interactions. for the second criterion, we derived the domain interactions in pdb from ipfam  <cit>  and then searched for proteins containing these domains in pfam  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  interactions with structural evidence were found between  <dig> alternatively spliced coding transcripts and  <dig> binding partners. by joining two interaction tables, we identified eight interactions having both experimental and structural evidence. as shown in fig.  <dig>  these eight interactions involved three genes with altered splicing domains, rabep <dig> , camk1d , and nr1h <dig> . the alternatively spliced exons in these genes overlapped with known protein domains, including rabaptin, pkinase, and ligand-binding domain of nuclear hormone receptor.fig.  <dig> ppi with both structural and experimental evidences. ten as gene products involved in protein-protein interactions. gene symbols are displayed in white regions, and corresponding protein domains are displayed with gray background. blue line indicates a gene/protein contains a domain, and a red line indicates an interaction between protein domains



the differences in the percentage of inclusion for these three events ranged from  <dig> to 31 %. the potential protein partners included rabep <dig>  gga <dig> , gga <dig> , gga <dig> , camkk <dig> , nr0b <dig> , rxra , and rxrb . lps-induced splicing changes could significantly impact these proteins’ interactions with their partners. among these putative protein interaction partners, only one protein, nr0b <dig> , was not expressed.

intrinsic disorder and molecular recognition features in lps-induced alternative spliced regions
it was previously reported that alternatively spliced regions are enriched with unfolded protein regions   <cit> . to examine these features within lps-induced alternatively spliced regions , we performed disorder prediction on the protein sequences of these regions using vsl2b  <cit> , a bioinformatics algorithm for predicting intrinsically disordered regions based on the biophysical properties of amino acids. among the alternative regions of  <dig> protein sequences translated from lps-induced alternative splicing events,  <dig>  were predicted to be totally disordered,  <dig>  partially disordered, and only  <dig>  totally structured . these percentages are consistent with previous reports that alternatively spliced exons tend to locate in intrinsically disordered regions  <cit> .fig.  <dig> predicted disorder of as gene products. a the distribution of  <dig> non-frameshifting protein coding as genes in three categories, including totally disordered, partially disordered and structured. b the morf containing and non-containing events among partially disordered as genes. the list of morf containing genes is shown on the right. c the same distribution and gene list as panel b but it is for totally disordered as genes



a molecular recognition feature  is a region in an rna that undergoes a disorder–order transformation while bound by another protein. we predicted morf regions within the alternative regions using the software tool morf <dig>  <cit> . as a result, among the  <dig> alternatively spliced exons in the partial or totally disordered regions,  <dig> contained regions predicted to be morfs ; these regions could thus be regarded as potential protein-protein interaction sites.

post-translational modification sites within alternatively spliced regions
we next annotated post-translational modification  sites in regions affected by lps-induced alternative splicing. we searched known ptm sites deposited in uniprot, and we also predicted novel ones using modpred  <cit> . three alternatively spliced exons containing known ptm  sites localized to three genes, abi <dig> , depdc1a , and ybx <dig> . in addition,  <dig> ptms were predicted to occur in  <dig> alternatively spliced regions, including proteolytic cleavage, phosphorylation, amidation, hydroxylation, carboxylation, adp-ribosylation, o-linked glycosylation, acetylation, gpi anchor amidation, palmitoylation, pyrrolidone carboxylic acid, methylation and ubiquitination . proteolytic cleavage sites were the most common ptm sites, appearing in  <dig> alternative regions. it is possible that lps affects the signaling activities of these proteins by inclusion or exclusion of the ptm sites in the final protein product .fig.  <dig> predicted ptm sites in as regions. column displays different types of ptm sites, and row displays the event types and lps-induced as genes. the numbers in the shadowed grids on the crossing of gene a and ptm type b shows how many type b ptm sites fall in the as region of gene a. the total number of ptm sites in each gene is displayed on the right, and the total number of ptm sites in each type is displayed on the top



characterization of potential splicing regulators
we defined  <dig> regulatory regions for each cassette exon event , among which region  <dig> and  <dig> are 150 nt constitute exon segments, region  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are 300 nt intronic segments, and region  <dig> is the whole cassette exon. we used fimo  <cit>  to search for cisbp-rna  <cit>  motifs within the regulatory regions of both up-regulated and down-regulated cassette exon events. with p-value cutoff of 1e- <dig> and fdr cutoff of  <dig> , we identified  <dig> rbp motifs in the up-regulated events, and  <dig> in the down-regulated events. brunol <dig>  brunol <dig> and rbm <dig> are the most frequently observed rbps. their motifs concentrate in region  <dig> and  <dig> for up-regulated events, and in region  <dig> for down-regulated events. these three proteins are all known as rna-splicing related. motifs of several other rna-splicing related proteins, including srsf <dig>  hnrnpl, hnrnpll, hnrnph <dig> and pcbp <dig>  are observed in both up-regulated and down-regulated cassette exon regulatory regions. some rbps  are found exclusively in up-regulated cassette exon events, and some  are found exclusively in down-regulated events.fig.  <dig> rna binding protein  motifs in regulatory regions of differentially spliced events. rbp names and their occurrences are listed adjacent to corresponding regulatory regions



discussion
lipopolysaccharide  is a complex associated with the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria, capable of triggering a series of cellular responses in many cell types. one promising advance is to use lps as a pre-conditioning agent to improve bmsc therapeutic efficacy for repairing ischemic, injured tissues  <cit> . for such application, because lps is a potent stimulant for the host immune system, bmscs should be washed using pbs to completely remove any residual endotoxin before administration. we reported previously that bmscs treated with lps produced more angiogenic factors vegf, igf- <dig> and hgf  <cit>  which can spur the formation of new blood vessels in ischemic tissue and survival and differentiation of implanted bmscs. by contrast, with the growing incidence of sepsis, in which free lps can bind to and activate toll-like receptor  <dig> on many cell types, the roles of lps on endogenous bmscs and other cell types are worth detailed investigation.

microarray studies have reported that expression levels of hundreds of genes can be altered after lps treatment in different tissues. in recent years, high-throughput rna sequencing technology has provided a more accurate and comprehensive measurement of rna transcript levels and their isoforms than historic array-based methods. this technological advance has enabled measuring not only gene expression level alterations amongst different conditions, but also complicated splicing pattern changes in response to specific cellular perturbations. in this study, we systematically identified alternative splicing changes in mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  in response to lps treatment, using rna-seq technology. we further implemented a series of bioinformatics tools to evaluate the biological functions of alternatively spliced exons and their host genes.

we observed strong enrichment in three functional categories amongst the gene products whose splicing patterns were altered by lps treatment, phosphoproteins, zinc finger proteins, and proteins subject to acetylation. most of these proteins were signaling proteins, and the subtle differences in their splicing isoforms could affect their function.

among  <dig> gene products containing as exons,  <dig> belonged to phosphoprotein families, five of which contained documented phosphorylation sites in their as regions found in the uniprot database. these proteins included kansl <dig> , depdc1a , abi <dig> , ybx <dig> , and ubl4a . the functions of these proteins strongly associate with the functions of bmscs. for instance, abi <dig> contains one cassette of exons whose percentage of inclusion increased by 14 % after lps induction , with one phosphorylation site in the as region documented in the uniprot database. widely expressed with highest levels in bone marrow, spleen, brain, testes, and embryonic brain, abi <dig> may negatively regulate cell growth and transformation by interacting with the nonreceptor tyrosine kinases abl <dig> and/or abl <dig>  thus regulating egf-induced erk pathway activation and egfr signaling. in addition to these five proteins, eight other as regions were predicted to have phosphorylation sites, based on their amino acid contents. these proteins included usp <dig> , mark <dig> , ncor <dig> , ctnnd <dig> , ambra <dig> , ddx <dig>  box helicase 6), ehbp1l <dig> , and akt1s <dig> . overall, lps may affect the functions of these proteins by including/excluding specific domains amenable to phosphorylation.

among the proteins containing lps-induced alternative splicing events,  <dig> contained multiple types of zinc finger domains, including phd , ring , and c2h2-type zinc-finger domains. four proteins, phf <dig> , phf <dig> , phf20l <dig> , and phrf <dig> , contained phd-type zinc finger domains known to recognize trimethylated histone lysines . four other proteins, rnf <dig> , rad <dig> , trim <dig> , and trim <dig> , all contain ring-type zinc fingers, known ligases for ubiquitination enzymes and their substrates. it is well documented that both phd and ring-type domains are usually involved in protein-protein binding  <cit> , and such binding could possibly be disrupted by splicing variations.

overall, the lps-induced as genes could be classified into several categories , including kinases, zinc-finger proteins, transcription, rna-binding, cytoskeleton, and protein acetylation. many of these proteins were also phosphoproteins, which play significant roles in cell signaling. analysis of the relationship between splicing and protein structure has suggested that as exons play major roles in controlling protein-protein interactions  through disrupting either known protein interaction domains or molecular recognition sites, which typically locate in intrinsically disordered regions. our analysis suggests that lps-induced alternative splicing could affect ppis through both mechanisms. in particular, protein interaction domains of three proteins with known ppi partners were disrupted by lps-induced splicing alterations . interestingly, all three interactive domains could self-interact , and one of these domains facilitates homodimerization of rabep <dig> . expressed in embryonic tissues and most types of stem cells, rabep <dig> showed abundant expression in bmscs . homo-dimerization of this protein is involved in early endosome fusion  <cit> , an event directly related to the paracrine effects of bmscs, where small vesicles are released when multivesicular endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane  <cit> . in addition, rabep <dig> also moderates intracellular transportation between lysosomes and the golgi apparatus  <cit> , and between the golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . lps treatment also increased the inclusion of the interaction domain by 14 %, which could increase either homodimerization or heterodimerization with other interaction partners.fig.  <dig> predicted interaction network among lps-induced as genes. red nodes indicate genes producing phosphoproteins, and gray nodes indicate genes not involved in protein phosphorylation. genes associated with terms other than phosphoproteins are clustered in corresponding shadowed areas. these terms include acetylation, cytoskeleton, transcription, zinc-finger, rna-binding and kinase



we further evaluated how differences in splicing patterns in transcriptional regulators affected their regulatory activity by assessing gene expression changes of their downstream target genes. nfya  contains an alternative acceptor site whose splicing pattern in bmscs is altered by lps treatment; the overall percentage of inclusion of the alternative acceptor site decreased by 31 % . moreover, the expression of five downstream target genes of nfya were enriched for genes found differentially expressed  by lps treatment , including col11a <dig> , col5a <dig> , fgfr <dig> , pgk <dig>  and rgs <dig> . it was previously reported that nfya activates transcription levels of col11a <dig> and fgfr <dig>  <cit> ; these two genes were both downregulated by lps, suggesting inhibition of nfya function by the removal of 18 nt  after lps treatment, thus impacting nfya downstream effectors.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we used rna sequencing to analyze lps-induced alternative splicing changes in bmscs. lps modified the alternative splicing pattern of phosphoproteins, zinc finger proteins, and proteins subject to acetylation. most of the affected proteins were signaling proteins that could change bmsc biological function. although it is still to be determined whether such modifications underlie bmsc therapeutic efficacy, our characterizations provide greater understanding of the mechanisms and clinical usage of promising bmsc therapies.
