BACKGROUND
the mechanisms and morphological changes that underlie the apoptotic process leading to cell death have been well-described  <cit> . in this regard, the induction of apoptosis has been shown to be important in embryonic development and in defending against infection of a eukaryotic host by microorganisms. examples of the latter have been shown for both viral and bacterial infections  <cit> . in contrast, some organisms, such as the intracellular pathogen chlamydia pneumoniae, have the capacity to inhibit the apoptotic process following infection  <cit> . this inhibition has been demonstrated in a number of different cell types, including neutrophils  <cit> , monocytes  <cit> , epithelial cells  <cit> , and microglial cells  <cit> . some chlamydia-infected host cells are resistant to pro-apoptotic stimuli such as tnfα, fas antibody, staurosporine, and uv-light  <cit> , and c. pneumoniae infection has been shown to down regulate pro-apoptotic cytoplasmic proteins such as caspase- <dig> and cytochrome c. intriguingly, c. pneumoniae infection also has been shown to activate anti-apoptotic proteins such as bcl- <dig> and nf-κβ  <cit> , the latter of which is critical in the expression of multiple genes involved in inflammatory responses and anti-apoptotic mechanisms  <cit> .

our laboratory has demonstrated c. pneumoniae infection in brain tissues from patients diagnosed with ad  <cit> . many cell types including monocytes, endothelial cells, glial cells and neurons were shown to be infected. interestingly, the infected cells did not appear to be undergoing degenerative changes, even though they were in the vicinity of cells demonstrating neurodegenerative pathology characteristic of ad. c. pneumoniae also has been identified within neurons in the ad brain by in situ hybridization  <cit>  as well as in the olfactory neuroepithelia, the olfactory bulbs and endothelia from c. pneumoniae-infected balb/c mice by immunohistochemistry  <cit> . collectively, these studies have correlated infection with c. pneumoniae to the neuropathology characteristic of ad, but the specific influences of infection on neuronal cell injury, cell death, and chronic inflammation are still being determined.

a major factor in ad is an inflammatory process thought to be stimulated by the processing and deposition of β-amyloid . although β-amyloid may promote inflammation, infectious agents such as c. pneumoniae also could provoke neuroinflammation in sporadic, late-onset ad that precedes or coincides with the deposition of aβ1– <dig> in the ad brain. the exact role that chlamydial infection plays with respect to abnormal processing and deposition of amyloid, however, remains to be determined and is beyond the scope of this report. in contrast, the focus of the current study was to determine how c. pneumoniae infection influences the apoptotic process within neuronal cells in culture during both short and long term infections.

RESULTS
several experimental paradigms  were utilized in these studies to determine the relationship between c. pneumoniae infection and apoptosis in neuronal cells as it relates to the pathogenesis of ad. c. pneumoniae was identified within neurons in hippocampal ad brain tissues . immunolabeling using antibodies specific to c. pneumoniae revealed a punctate labeling pattern identifying the chlamydial bodies within several neurons . delineation of the chlamydial bodies from lipofuscin in the neurons was determined using a secondary antibody conjugated to alkaline phosphatase red as compared to the substrate diaminobenzine , since lipofuscin and dab typically have a brownish appearance in histological preparations.

to confirm that a homogenous neuronal phenotype was maintained in culture, sk-n-mc neuroblastoma cells were screened with antibodies to βiii-tubulin , a cytoskeletal protein expressed in neuronal cells. quantitation yielded a homogeneous neuronal phenotype; greater than 90% of the cells labeled for βiii-tubulin. these cells were also analyzed for any morphological changes that may occur following incubation with  <dig> % dimethylsulfoxide , the vehicle for the apoptotic inducing agent staurosporine, as dmso has been used at higher concentrations to induce apoptosis in cultured cells. in these control experiments, the cell's nuclear integrity did not reveal any morphological changes characteristic of apoptotic nuclear fragmentation as is evident from the hoechst-stained nuclear profiles . additionally, when cells were incubated with the fitc- or rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody without prior labeling by primary antibody, non-specific binding of either the fitc- or rhodamine-conjugated secondary was not observed ; this confirmed the specificity of the secondary antibodies.

in order to determine the effects exerted on the apoptotic process by an infection with c. pneumoniae in neuronal cells, sknmc neuroblastoma cells were inoculated with the respiratory strain of c. pneumoniae, ar- <dig>  at an moi of  <dig>  these cells were propagated for  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection followed by immunolabeling with fitc-conjugated anti-chlamydial antibodies, 60c <dig> and imagen containing evans blue staining the cytoplasm red . at both  <dig> and  <dig> days post-infection chlamydial inclusions were observed and the nuclei did not appear fragmented as revealed by hoechst staining.

during apoptosis, phosphatidylserine is translocated from the inner to the outer plasma membrane leaflet. this externalization was analyzed with annexin v-fitc in conjunction with hoechst staining to examine nuclear fragmentation in  <dig> day infected cells. in the absence of staurosporine, uninfected cells  and those infected with c. pneumoniae  showed no evidence of apoptosis by either hoechst or annexin v staining. staurosporine-treated, uninfected cells, however, showed prominent nuclear fragmentation and phosphatidylserine externalization . in the case of staurosporine-treated, chlamydia-infected neuroblastoma cells, most nuclear profiles appeared unaffected with only a few cells demonstrating very early apoptotic morphologic changes .

hoechst staining was used to visualize the nuclear morphology of neuroblastoma cells in which uninfected cells and cells infected with c. pneumoniae were induced to undergo apoptosis by staurosporine . nuclear profiles were analyzed in  <dig> random fields from three separate experiments . uninfected cells , cells infected for  <dig> days  and cells infected for  <dig> days  that had not been exposed to staurosporine yielded minimal nuclear fragmentation. when treated with staurosporine, 84% of uninfected neuroblastoma cells demonstrated apoptotic nuclear profiles . in contrast, nuclear fragmentation characteristic of apoptosis was observed in only 47% of cells that were infected for  <dig> days  and 50% of cells infected for  <dig> days  when subsequently treated with staurosporine. chi-squared analysis indicated that this inhibition of apoptosis by the infection was highly statistically significant .

the effect of infection by c. pneumoniae upon the caspase pathway in the apoptotic process was examined using immunocytochemistry techniques. sk-n-mc neuronal cells were infected with the ar <dig> strain of c. pneumoniae and incubated with  <dig> μm staurosporine for  <dig> hours to induce apoptosis , then screened for apoptosis with an antibody specific for the activated form of caspase  <dig>  in conjunction with hoechst staining to reveal the nuclear profiles. in the absence of staurosporine, uninfected sk-n-mc cells revealed a normal nuclear profile  with minimal active caspase- <dig>  whereas uninfected cells treated with staurosporine clearly demonstrated the characteristic apoptotic nuclear fragmentation and activated caspase  <dig> . in cells infected with c. pneumoniae , inclusion bodies were detected by immunolabeling with a specific anti-chlamydial antibody. in non-staurosporine treated cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs post-infection, there was virtually no visual evidence of apoptosis . in contrast, in cells infected with c. pneumoniae and treated with staurosporine , only in the  <dig> hr post-infection culture was there limited evidence of apoptotic nuclear fragmentation and activated caspase  <dig> .

to assess whether caspase activity is inhibited by c. pneumoniae in acute or extended stages of infection, caspase activity was quantitatively measured for uninfected cells and cells at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours post-infection. the change in caspase 3/ <dig> activity induced by  <dig> μm staurosporine is plotted in figure  <dig> relative to the change observed in uninfected cells . in cells assayed at  <dig> hours post-infection , caspase 3/ <dig> activity in the absence of staurosporine was slightly suppressed compared to uninfected cells, but most notably the increase in activity induced by staurosporine was suppressed to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  compared to staurosporine-treated, uninfected cells . at longer times post-infection, staurosporine induced a larger increase in activity , indicating that the infection was less inhibitory at these time points, most likely as a result of a decrease in the fraction of infected cells in the cultures at these longer infection times.

discussion
the current in vitro neuronal studies demonstrate that infection of human neuroblastoma cells by c.pneumoniae has an effect on apoptosis following staurosporine induction, as measured by characteristics of apoptosis such as nuclear fragmentation, cytoplasmic membrane inversion, and caspase 3/ <dig> activation. the data suggest that neuronal cells can develop and maintain a chronic and prolonged infection with c.pneumoniae through  <dig> days post-infection. inhibition of apoptosis was measured from  <dig> hours through  <dig> days post-infection, and apoptosis inhibition was observed throughout this period. however, c. pneumoniae had a more robust effect on inhibiting apoptosis in neuronal cells at  <dig> hr post-infection as compared to  <dig> day post-infection. these results are consistent with other studies that have determined that c. pneumoniae infection inhibits apoptosis in monocytes  <cit> , neutrophils  <cit> , and epithelial cells  <cit> .

human neuroblastoma cell lines can be induced to undergo apoptosis when incubated in staurosporine at several concentrations  <cit> . staurosporine is a potent inhibitor of numerous kinases, including protein kinase c and camp-dependent protein kinases  <cit> , calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  <cit> , and receptor tyrosine kinases  <cit> . in cells undergoing staurosporine-induced apoptosis, levels of the pro-apoptotic protein bax at the mitochondrion are increased, resulting in release of cytochrome c and subsequent activation of caspase  <dig> and caspase  <dig>  <cit> . this release has been shown to be blocked upon infection with c. pneumoniae  <cit> . in our studies, caspase 3/ <dig> activity was inhibited upon infection with c. pneumoniae, possibly resulting from inhibition of cytochrome c release. alternatively, activation of caspase 3/ <dig> could be inhibited by infection with c. pneumoniae downstream and/or upstream of cytochrome c release, consistent with inhibition of apoptosis at several levels of the apoptotic mitochondrial pathway  <cit> . one report indicated that apoptosis of endothelial cells was indeed inhibited by infection with c. pneumoniae, although cell death by necrosis was not  <cit> . necrosis of these cells was correlated to an increased concentration of intracellular reactive oxygen species following infection.

interestingly, while there is evidence for the induction of apoptosis in the alzheimer's diseased brain, data on the completion of this process are questionable  <cit> . in ad brains, increased levels of pro-apoptotic proteins governing mitochondrial integrity and caspase activity have been demonstrated. these data suggest that caspase activation may be a key factor in modulating the apoptotic process in neurons  <cit> . in vitro experiments have shown that β-amyloid peptides can activate the caspase cascade in neurons resulting in cell death  <cit> . however, the extent to which neurons die in ad as a result of apoptosis remains controversial  <cit> .

apoptosis is not necessarily congruent with a slow, progressive neurodegenerative disease. it is plausible that neuronal cell death may occur through several mechanisms even though neurodegeneration may commence along with early apoptotic events. at first glance, our infection data appear to controvert findings of significant neuronal degeneration and cell death. however, because infection with c. pneumoniae can both inhibit apoptosis and promote cell death by necrosis  <cit> , and because we have continually observed c. pneumoniae infection in sporadic, late-onset ad brain tissues  <cit> , the possibility that infection of neuronal cells in ad could lead to cell death by necrosis is compelling as this would implicate the inflammatory process. there are numerous reports of significant neuroinflammation in ad in which cell damage and death are thought to occur as the result of inflammation  <cit> .

because the amount of amyloid precursor protein  is increased in areas of ad neuropathology, many studies have focused on the cytotoxic effects of exogenous  β-amyloid  <cit> . however, the role of endogenous  β-amyloid in the neuronal cell's viability remains a conundrum. recently, endogenous app has been shown to have anti-apoptotic effects on cells isolated from dorsal root ganglia  <cit> . suppression of apoptosis by the neuron could be an adaptation to combat stimuli that pathologically up-regulate endogenous amyloid. these stimuli, such as perhaps infection with c. pneumoniae, may indirectly block death of the host cell through this anti-apoptotic effect, thereby promoting the obligate intracellular bacterium's ability to replicate within the host. while inhibiting apoptosis may be favorable to the bacterium, maintaining a chronic or prolonged infection that also up-regulates amyloid could ultimately lead to chronic disease states. the neuron's tolerance to amyloid is likely to be concentration-dependent and overwhelming amyloid production and processing may result in the amyloid pathology characteristic of ad.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, c. pneumoniae readily infects neuroblastoma cells in vitro and maintains a prolonged infection by inhibiting apoptosis. as c. pneumoniae also has been demonstrated to infect neurons in ad brains  <cit> , the ability to inhibit the apoptotic process could result in long-term infection in situ. inhibition of apoptosis by suppression of caspase 3/ <dig> activity, and/or by decreasing levels of active caspase  <dig>  may be mechanisms by which c. pneumoniae can sustain a prolonged infection in the host and optimize its intracellular environment. chronic and/or prolonged infection in the ad brain may promote amyloidogenesis, neuroinflammation, and ultimately pathology found in late-onset sporadic ad. in this way, infection with c. pneumoniae in neuronal cells could contribute to the overall neuropathogenesis of this disease.
