BACKGROUND
soybean  merr) seed oil is the most widely utilized edible oil in the united states , and the second most widely consumed edible oil worldwide . the majority  of us soybean oil is used for salad/cooking, frying/baking and industrial uses, representing ~53%, ~21%, and 20% respectively .

until very recently the majority of soybean oil underwent partial or full hydrogenation to increase oxidative stability  <cit> . this practice also generates trans fats, which has attracted negative public attention due to the findings that high dietary intake of trans fats elevated blood serum levels of low density lipoprotein  cholesterol  <cit>  and elevated serum ldl levels are directly correlated with increased risk of coronary heart disease  <cit> . as a result, labeling of products containing trans fats is required by law within the united states  <cit>  and the american heart association has recommended that trans fats be reduced as much as feasible .

stearic acid  is the desired end product of full hydrogenation of soybean oil  and stearic acid has been shown to neither elevate nor reduce blood serum ldl cholesterol  <cit> . in controlled diets, the replacement of other saturated fats  with “heart neutral” stearic acid was shown to be beneficial on ldl cholesterol levels  <cit> . regrettably, stearic acid forms a minute portion of the total seed oil for most plants; only 3-4% of soybean seed oil is present as stearic acid in typical cultivars  <cit> . theobroma cacao  seeds possess an exceptional ~ <dig> % stearic acid content, which is used to make cocoa butter  <cit> , but t. cacao is a rare exception and the potential for enhancing production of this tropical tree crop is extremely limited.

in arabidopsis, loss of function for one specific  stearoyl-acyl carrier protein desaturase  gene isoform increases both seed  <cit>  and leaf stearic acid content  <cit> , but also has pleiotropic effects on plant defense signaling  <cit> . studies in arabidopsis identified at least seven distinct isoforms that are expressed in various tissues. these isoforms were demonstrated to have activity differences for either c16: <dig> or c18: <dig> precursors  <cit> . in contrast to arabidopsis, soybean has a smaller subset of sacpd gene isoforms, with only three actively transcribed . sacpd-a and –b protein products are highly similar  and are predicted to be targeted to plastids  <cit> . sacpd-c is quite divergent from the other two sacpd isoforms  and it is not clear if sacpd-c protein is targeted solely to plastids or is dual targeted to plastids and mitochondria in planta <cit> .

mutant soybean lines with elevated seed stearic acid content were first reported in the 1980’s. one sodium azide induced mutant line, a <dig>  has a remarkable ~28% of the total seed oil present in the form of stearic acid   <cit> . the increase in stearic acid content of seeds in a <dig>  <cit>  was reported to be due solely to deletion of sacpd-c <cit> . unfortunately, a significant negative correlation was found between elevated stearic acid content and seed yield using the a <dig> mutant line. additional mutant sources with slightly less stearic acid content  do not have the same negative association with seed yield  <cit> .

in this work, we utilized cgh with four radiation induced mutant soybean lines with moderately elevated seed stearic acid . the complimentary methods of cgh and genetic analysis were used to identify and confirm that the genetic basis for the moderately elevated seed stearic acid phenotype was due to mutations affecting the sacpd-c gene, in five independent mutant lines from multiple genetic backgrounds and mutagens. the sacpd-c gene is strongly expressed in seeds but also in nodules. in all of the independent mutant lines with elevated seed stearic acid, sacpd-c mutations also resulted in nodules with very atypical nodule structure. under laboratory growth conditions, however, these changes did not affect nitrogen fixation levels.

RESULTS
oil phenotypes of mutant lines with elevated seed stearic acid
the mutant lines kk <dig>  mm <dig> and m <dig> were previously identified by a forward screen of x-ray induced mutant lines  <cit>  of the soybean cultivar ‘bay’  <cit> . none of these three mutant lines  were significantly different in seed stearic acid content when grown in either  <dig> or  <dig>  at a columbia, mo field location. a <dig> was released in  <dig> as a sodium azide induced mutant of ‘fa8077’ and was reported to have an  <dig> to 10-fold increase in seed stearic acid levels   <cit> . when grown in columbia, mo, a <dig> was found to have 257 ± 44 g stearic acid kg−1seed oil in  <dig> and similar levels  when grown in  <dig>  full details on fatty acid profiles of these mutants are provided in table  <dig>

comparative genome hybridization and sequence analysis of mutant line mm106
radiation induced mutagenesis can result in genomic deletions, which can vary in size from single base deletions/alterations to chromosomal level deletions, translocations and inversions  <cit> . comparative genomic hybridization  using microarray slides has emerged as a powerful tool to quantify genomic deletions and copy number variants  <cit> . we utilized a custom soybean cgh array  <cit> , based on the ‘williams 82’ genome sequence  <cit> , to compare the mutant line mm <dig> with its progenitor line ‘bay’. based on previous work which demonstrated that deletion of the sacpd-c locus in line a <dig> elevated seed stearic acid to ~28%  <cit> , we anticipated that mm <dig> bore a deletion distinct from sacpd-c.

the cgh technique revealed a moderately large deletion  affecting chromosome  <dig> in mm <dig> . in contrast to our a priori expectations, the larger deletion was found to include the sacpd-c locus ,  <dig> additional genes from the glyma  <dig>  high confidence gene set , and  <dig> genes from the “low confidence” gene set . despite attempts with  <dig> different primer pairs, all efforts to bridge this deletion were unsuccessful . however, the absence of sacpd-c was confirmed by pcr  and by southern blot analysis .

sacpd-c
two additional small deletions affecting separate chromosomes are predicted to result in partial deletions of two gene models in mm <dig> . we also noted several genomic regions which displayed increased probe signal, which could indicate the presence of a radiation induced duplication, herein termed a copy number variant . a summary of all genomic deletions identified is provided in table  <dig> and full details on statistically significant deletions and putative cnv are included in additional file  <dig> 

cgh and sanger sequencing analysis of m <dig> and kk24
we also utilized the cgh technique to compare two other ‘bay’ derived high stearic lines, created during the same mutagenesis experiment  <cit> . we noted highly similar hybridization patterns for m <dig> and kk <dig> as compared to ‘bay’  and both kk <dig> and m <dig> have a common ~182 kbps genomic deletion affecting chromosome  <dig> . we utilized pcr to bridge this deletion  and sequencing of the pcr product revealed that both lines bear an identical simple ~ <dig> kbp genomic deletion  with no extraneous dna inserted. the common gm <dig> deletion is predicted to result in loss of  <dig> genes from the high confidence glyma  <dig>  gene set, and another  <dig> from the low confidence list .

for m <dig>  the hybridization signal for probes corresponding to the proximal arm of chromosome  <dig> were highly variable . a similar variability was observed for certain genomic regions when comparing ‘williams 82’ accessions from different seed stocks  <cit>  and was attributed to residual heterozygosity in the original bc6f2: <dig> ‘williams 82’  <cit>  line, prior to seed distribution. we examined several simple sequence repeat  markers corresponding to this region for m <dig>  kk <dig>  mm <dig> and ‘bay’ and noted polymorphism between m <dig> and kk24/bay/mm <dig> , which supports the hypothesis that the common ancestor of ‘bay’/mm106/m25/kk <dig> bore residual heterozygosity in this region.

the cgh technique did not reveal any large deletions in the vicinity of any sacpd genes for m25/kk <dig> . however, small deletions could potentially be missed using the current array. to address this possibility, we also pcr amplified and sanger sequenced each of the four known sacpd genes in soybean for m <dig>  kk <dig> and ‘bay’ . sequence traces for sacpd-a, −b and –d were identical to ‘bay’. for sacpd-c, kk <dig> and m <dig> bear a common single base deletion within exon  <dig> of sacpd-c , which results in the introduction of a frameshift mutation starting at codon  <dig> .

based on the highly similar overall cgh pattern, the identical single base deletion within exon  <dig> of sacpd-c, and the identical genomic deletion affecting gm <dig>  it is clear that m <dig> and kk <dig> arose from a single line. despite this common origin, these lines are not identical. the most likely possibility is that the original ‘bay’ seed that gave rise to m25/kk <dig> had residual heterozygosity for the gm <dig> region that has since segregated in the progeny.

analysis of segregating f2: <dig> progeny from crossing mm <dig> or kk <dig> to wild type lines
a simpleprobe based molecular marker assay was developed to track the single base deletion in kk24/m <dig> . this allowed statistical analysis of phenotypic data points based on sacpd-c genotypic categories. homozygosity for the single base deletion was found to be perfectly associated with moderately increased seed stearic acid content .

since it was not possible to bridge the deletion in mm <dig>  we used pcr primers specific for the sacpd-c locus  to detect homozygous mutants. it was not possible to differentiate heterozygotes from homozygote wild type lines using this method. nevertheless, homozygosity for the sacpd-c deletion in mm <dig> was completely associated with elevated seed stearic acid levels .

k <dig>  m <dig> and mm <dig> were phenotypically indistinguishable from the genomic deletion present in mm <dig> during both field years . we also crossed the single base deletion line kk <dig> with the entire locus deletion line mm <dig> and found no statistically significant difference between any of the progeny of this cross .

comparative genome hybridization of elevated stearic fast neutron induced mutant line fn8
as part of an existing reverse genetic study  <cit> , a fast neutron induced mutant line was identified which bears a relatively small deletion  predicted to contain the sacpd-c locus . this line displayed elevated seed stearic acid , which was statistically indistinguishable from the sacpd-c deletion line mm <dig>  kk <dig> or m <dig> .

we examined the association of this deletion with seed fatty acid profile in a small bc1f <dig> population. as with other sacpd-c mutants, homozygosity for this deletion, as determined by southern blot analysis  or by pcr based assay , was perfectly correlated with the elevation of seed stearic acid content .

identification of ems induced sacpd-c mutant line 194d
we also performed a forward genetic screen on an ethyl methanesulphonate  induced mutant population of ‘williams 82’ for alterations in fatty acid composition. one line demonstrated elevated stearic acid  and was selected for further analysis. a single snp was identified within exon two of the sacpd-c gene , which resulted in a missense substitution of an almost invariant residue .

cgh and dna sequence analysis of sacpd-c deletion line a6
the genomic deletion containing sacpd-c in a <dig>  <cit>  was reported to have arisen due to sodium azide mutagenesis performed on seeds from ‘fa 8077’  <cit> . however, the full extent of the genomic deletion has not been quantified. we utilized cgh to contrast a <dig> with the progenitor line ‘fa 8077’ . this revealed a range of small to medium deletions , a moderately large deleted region  and one extraordinarily large deletion corresponding to ~1/ <dig> of chromosome  <dig> . the largest deletion identified  contains the sacpd-c locus, as well as at least  <dig> genes from the high confidence gene set  as defined by the current glyma  <dig>  gene annotation . we also identified several overrepresented probe regions .

analysis of sacpd-a and –b gene expression in a6
one hypothesis for the difference in seed stearic acid content between the high stearic line a <dig> and the series of moderate stearic acid lines is that sacpd-a or –b could have impaired function. we amplified and sanger sequenced these genes from ‘fa 8077’ and a <dig>  for sacpd-a and –d, we observed no polymorphisms between a <dig> and ‘fa 8077’. we unexpectedly identified a large number of intronic and silent polymorphisms in sacpd-b  . we also utilized quantitative rt-pcr to evaluate expression of sacpd-a, −b and –c during mid-maturation of green soybean seeds. the expression levels of sacpd-a and –b were not statistically different between any of the lines examined . in contrast, sacpd-c expression was completely absent in seeds from both mm <dig> and a <dig>  as compared to ‘bay’ .

analysis of nodule function and morphology in sacpd-c mutant lines
soybean plants can establish a symbiotic interaction with certain soil bacteria  which leads to the development of a new root organ, the nodule, where bacteria differentiate into bacteroids that fix atmospheric nitrogen for assimilation by the host plant. the ability of soybean to perform biological n <dig> fixation contributes to its agronomic importance and, on average accounts for 50-60% of soybean n requirement  <cit> . we utilized the publicly available genome-wide gene expression index for soybean  <cit>  and the soyseq resource  to investigate the expression pattern of sacpd-related genes. we noted very high levels of expression of sacpd-c in both seeds and nodules . therefore, in addition to the effects of sacpd-c mutations on seed stearic acid levels, the potential exists for additional impacts on nodule development and physiology.

to determine if mutations in sacpd-c result in altered fatty acid composition in other soybean tissues besides seeds, we examined the oil profile of leaves, roots and nodules for a subset of homozygous sacpd-c mutants and selected wild-type lines . as previously mentioned, fn8- <dig>  and 194d  are derived from ‘williams 82’. fam94- <dig> is a naturally occurring mutant line selected from a cross involving cultivar brim, which contains a spontaneous  point mutation  in sacpd-c <cit> . like fn8- <dig> and 194d, a sacpd-c mutation in fam94- <dig> resulted in moderately increased seed stearate  levels compared to the reference wild-type cultivar dare  <cit> . stearic acid precursors  were significantly higher and oleic acid  precursors were significantly lower in nodules of mutant lines as compared to their wild type progenitors . these alterations in fatty acid profile were not observed in leaf and root tissues, indicating that functional sacpd-c is not necessary in the desaturation of c18: <dig> to c18:1Δ9cis precursors in these vegetative tissues.

to determine if the mutations in sacpd-c negatively impact nodule development, we performed morphological examination of nodule sections formed by mutant and wild-type plants. hand sections of nodules obtained from the sacpd-c deletion lines a <dig> and fn8- <dig>  as well as the point mutant lines 194d, kk <dig> and fam94- <dig>  showed gross morphological defects which were not observed in any wild-type nodules . we also examined nodules from another ‘bay’ mutant, m <dig>  which has increased seed oleic acid due to deletion of the fad2-1a locus. nodules of this line lacked aberrant nodule morphology . nodules formed by sacpd-c mutants showed aberrant formation of central cavities, usually accompanied by obvious discoloration . formation of central necrotic zones was observed on older nodules as early as two weeks after bacterial inoculation and was slightly more prominent in the nodules formed by the mutant line a <dig> . we also examined the co-segregation of the nodule phenotype with the sacpd-c mutant allele derived from kk <dig>  in a blinded experiment on progeny of a single heterozygous f <dig> plant , we ascertained that only f2: <dig> progeny plants homozygous for the sacpd-c mutant allele formed aberrant nodules . a minute number of degrading nodules was found in lines which inherited either heterozygosity or homozygosity for wild type alleles, and these categories were not statistically significantly different. taken together, these segregation data and, more importantly, the occurrence of the aberrant nodule phenotype in several independent mutation events  provides unequivocal evidence that functional sacpd-c is required for normal nodule development in soybean. this phenotype is consistent with the high level of sacpd-c expression in nodules.

nodule sections were stained with toluidine blue to further characterize the aberrant nodule development in the sacpd-c mutants. microscopic examination of wild-type nodule sections showed infected nodule cells filled with toluidine blue-stained bacteroids . in contrast, fewer bacteroids were observed in the necrotic regions of sacpd-c mutant nodules . we also performed phase contrast microscopy of thick resin sections of nodules prepared for electron microscopy using ultra-rapid freezing to examine the sub-cellular detail of cells bordering the necrotic zone . cells are absent in the necrotic zone  and those bordering the nz are in various stages of degradation. intact cells near the nz that contain bacteroids have little if any host cytoplasm . thin section electron micrographs of this material revealed a dichotomy of bacteroid quality. in host cells at the periphery of the nodule, bacteroid ultrastructure is indistinguishable from wild type plants , but those in cells close to the nz, such as marked with the asterisk in figure 9b, are senescent .

lastly, we determined the effects of the sacpd-c mutations on nodule formation and symbiotic n <dig> fixation. nodulation efficiency, measured as nodule fresh weight per plant, was not affected in the sacpd-c mutants . likewise, acetylene reduction activity, a well-established, proxy method to assay the conversion of atmospheric n <dig> into ammonium , showed no statistically significant difference between the wild type and sacpd-c mutant lines . we did, however, note statistically significant differences between soybean cultivars ‘williams 82’ and ‘dare’ in nitrogenase activity but not in nodule accumulation . the genetic basis and practical significance  of these differences between the soybean cultivars are currently unknown.

discussion
clarification of the genetic mechanisms behind elevated seed stearic acid in soybean
in this work, we expanded on previous studies with soybean lines bearing elevated seed stearic acid content  <cit> . we analyzed radiation induced mutant lines  from two independent sources  that all had very similar elevations in stearic acid content . deletion of the sacpd-c locus was reported to elevate seed stearic acid levels in a <dig> to ~28%  <cit> , so we anticipated that a second locus could be mutated or deleted in these moderately elevated  seed stearic acid lines.

in contrast to expectation based on the phenotype of the a <dig> line, we observed that deletion of the entire sacpd-c locus was only able to elevate seed stearic acid content to ~ <dig> to 15% . one study reported genetic segregation of ~9% to 27% stearic acid content in a cross between the sacpd-c deletion line a <dig> and a missense sacpd-c mutation line fam94- <dig>  <cit> . the overall conclusion of the researchers was that a single locus was causative, but an alternate hypothesis is that an unlinked locus is present in a <dig> which acts in conjunction with the sacpd-c deletion to elevate stearic acid content beyond the 10-15% threshold.

we evaluated the possibility that one of the two other seed expressed sacpd genes could be non-functional in a <dig>  however, we found no significant differences in sacpd-a and –b mrna accumulation , and no polymorphisms were identified that could affect the coding regions . collectively, these results support the hypothesis that another unidentified, non-sacpd locus is acting synergistically with the deletion of sacpd-c locus to elevate seed stearic acid levels to the extremely high levels  found in a <dig>  the identification of the additional locus/loci will require significant population development and advancement, as detection of deletions is most successful with advanced populations which have low heterozygosity.

prior studies indicated that sodium azide typically induces a/t → g/c transversions, but not genomic deletions  <cit> . we observed multiple independent polymorphisms between a <dig> and ‘fa8077’  within sacpd-b. neither this observation nor the presence of large genomic deletions is compatible with a <dig> arising from sodium azide mutagenesis being performed on ‘fa 8077’. it is likely that a <dig> arose from a radiation-induced mutagenesis project performed on an unknown breeding line.

inheritance of the elevated stearic trait from a <dig> has been reported to be associated with reduced seed yield  <cit>  and greater than normal sensitivity to temperature stresses  <cit> . although unproven, it is very likely that the seed yield reduction and temperature sensitivity of a <dig> may be due to the extremely large deletion affecting chromosome  <dig> . studies with mutations allelic to a <dig>  but which only accumulate 10-15% stearic acid, failed to reveal a correlation with reduced protein content or reduced seed yield  <cit> . these deleterious effects are not apparently due to the loss of sacpd-c, though the deletion may contain other linked genes whose loss results in these effects.

applicability and limitations of cgh for analysis of deletion mutants
although the detection of homozygous deletions was straightforward using cgh, we were unable to bridge the majority of the radiation-induced deletions by pcr with flanking pcr primers. this may be due to non-simple deletions  or due to difficulties presented by the relatively diffuse probe placement  complicated by the ancestrally polyploid nature of the soybean genome  <cit> . we also noted that many such deletion borders occur in regions of the genome rich with repetitive elements. however, other approaches to detect the deletions identified by cgh can be employed, such as southern blot analysis or pcr amplifications to determine the presence or absence of the gene of interest. all of the cnv and deletions identified for induced mutant lines  identified in our studies will be publicly available on the soybase community website  and will hopefully prove useful for reverse genetics approaches to annotate soybean gene function.

sacpd-c enzymatic activity has a functional role in nodule development
the functional role of sacpd-c in converting stearic acid to oleic acid in soybean seeds is well established  <cit> . however, publicly available whole-genome soybean gene expression data show sacpd-c to be highly expressed in both seeds and root nodules  compared to sacpd-a or sacpd–b . a homolog of the soybean sapcd-c gene was also identified as a nodulin gene  in yellow lupine   <cit> . to obtain broader insight on the effects of sacpd-c mutations on plant fatty acid metabolism, we extended our fatty acid profile analysis to other plant tissues in addition to seeds. indeed, we found altered levels of stearic and oleic acid levels in both seeds and root nodules of sacpd-c mutants . in contrast, we found no consistent statistically significant differences between the fatty acid profile of either leaves or roots of sacpd-c mutants in comparison to parental lines . our results are consistent with the “subfunctionalization” hypothesis  <cit>  for restriction of sacpd-c function to seeds and nodules, in concordance with the sacpd-c expression profile. likewise, functional redundancy among the sacpd isoforms is likely the reason for the largely unaltered fatty acid profile in leaves and roots of sacpd-c mutant plants.

the nodules of fast-growing annual legume species are relatively short-lived and n2-fixing capacity begins to decline at 3– <dig> weeks after infection. in determinate nodules such as those produced by soybean, senescence develops radially, starting from the center and gradually spreading toward the outside  <cit> . detailed morphological evaluation of root nodules formed by sacpd-c mutants and wild-type parental lines indicated that mutant plants harboring any of six independent sacpd-c mutations showed aberrant nodule development. mutant nodules formed central cavities surrounded by senescent cells in various stages of degradation , indicative of premature senescence. this nodulation phenotype was observed in the sacpd-c deletion lines a <dig>  mm <dig>  and fn8- <dig>  as well as multiple, independent the point mutant lines; i.e. 194d , kk <dig>  and fam94- <dig> . the aberrant nodule phenotype also co-segregated perfectly with homozygosity for sacpd-c mutant alleles encoded by kk <dig> in progeny of a heterozygous f <dig> plant . since multiple, independent sacpd-c alleles were analyzed, three of which are point mutants, we are confident that the observed nodule phenotype is due to the sacpd-c lesions per se, rather than linked co-deleted genes in a <dig>  mm <dig> and fn <dig>  the major sacpd-c isoform in soybean seeds was previously shown to have a markedly specific activity  for c18: <dig> precursors relative to c16: <dig> precursors  <cit> . this is also the case in nodules, as indicated by the significantly increased stearic acid  and decreased oleic acid  levels in sacpd-c mutant nodules, whereas a similar increase in c16: <dig> levels was not observed. the data argue for a crucial role of sacpd-c in nodule development with the early nodule senescence phenotype due to altered biosynthesis of stearic and oleic acid precursors in sacpd-c mutant nodules.

a dramatic expansion of the plant host cell membrane occurs during root nodule organogenesis and down-regulation of genes involved in membrane lipid biosynthesis and transport was recently shown to adversely affect nodule development  <cit> . metabolomic profiling studies also showed differential accumulation of fatty acids, the key building blocks of membrane lipids, between roots and nodules, as well as between infected and uninfected root hairs  <cit> . interestingly, oleic acid precursors, which are a direct product of sacpd enzyme action, were found to increase significantly in root hairs in response to bradyrhizobium japonicum rhizobial infection  <cit> . the sacpd-c mutants showed comparable nodulation efficiency to that of wild-type plants , indicating that a functional sacpd-c is not critical for nodule formation per se. however, it is unclear why alterations in fatty acid metabolism in sacpd-c mutant nodules can lead to premature nodule senescence.

one possibility is that changes in the ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in sacpd-c mutant nodules destabilizes nodule membranes, leading to premature nodule senescence. such changes in fatty acid composition are known to affect membrane lipid fluidity in plants  <cit> . moreover, biochemical and cytological studies indicate that the symbiosome membrane, i.e. the membrane surrounding the n2-fixing bacteroids, may be the first target for degradation in the nodule senescence process  <cit> . on the other hand, down-regulation of sacpd genes, through mutations or gene silencing, is known to trigger constitutive plant defense responses and spontaneous cell death lesions  <cit> . altered fatty acid metabolism in sacpd-c mutant nodules  may potentially trigger plant host defense responses to restrict endosymbiont proliferation.

under laboratory growth conditions, we did not detect a significant reduction in n2-fixing capability of mutant nodules compared to wild-type . we surmise that the nitrogen fixing activity is in the peripheral nodule cells that contain healthy bacteroids  and in newly formed, n2-fixing nodules on younger roots.

root nodule senescence is often initiated by stress conditions such as extremes of temperature, drought, pathogen or heavy metals  <cit> . this is consistent with the known function of polyunsaturated fatty acids in enhancing the ability of plants to tolerate environmental stresses  <cit> . although several early nodule senescence mutants have been identified , and the value of nodulation is well documented in agriculture, relatively little is known about developmental and stress-induced nodule senescence. it is probable that sacpd-c contributes to significantly increased nodule sustainability under field conditions. nevertheless, the full role of sacpd function in the interaction of soybean with symbiotic bacteria remains to be elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
previous studies had reported that deletion of one specific soybean stearoyl acyl carrier protein desaturase gene  as solely causative for highly increased  seed stearic acid in mutant line a <dig>  we investigated a series of five independent mutation events with moderate increases  in seed stearic acid content, which arose from multiple genetic backgrounds and/or mutagenic agents, using comparative genome hybridization and targeted sequencing of sacpd genes. in contrast to expectation, all lines with moderately elevated seed stearic acid bear deletions or loss-of-function mutations affecting sacpd-c. a <dig> was found to have multiple, extremely large genomic deletions; the deletion of sapcd-c in a <dig> consists of ~1/ <dig> of chromosome  <dig> and contains at least  <dig> genes. defective nodule development is unlikely to explain the yield drag seen in the a <dig> deletion line since all the mutants examined were altered in sapd-c function but not all sacpd-c mutants show a reduction in yield. therefore, it is more likely that the extraordinarily large deletion may explain a6’s extremely poor agronomic characteristics, which has hindered commercialization of high seed stearic acid lines. another, independent locus must be deleted or mutated in line a <dig>  which acts synergistically with the sacpd-c deletion to elevate seed stearic acid from ~ <dig> % to ~28%.

analysis of sacpd-c in public gene expression databases revealed high expression in both developing seeds and nitrogen fixing nodules, which suggested a subfuntionalized role for sacpd-c in seed and nodule biology. we investigated nodules of sacpd-c mutant lines, from multiple genetic backgrounds and mutagenesis experiments, and found all bear dramatically altered nodule morphology and seed/nodule fatty acid profiles. although the nodule morphological defects were not correlated with reduced nitrogen fixation under laboratory growth conditions, it is probable that sacpd-c contributes to increased nodule sustainability and/or maintenance under field conditions where plants are subjected to more pronounced environmental stresses.
