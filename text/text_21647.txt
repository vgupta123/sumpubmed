BACKGROUND
plant cell walls are complex structures composed of polysaccharides influencing plant morphology, defense, growth, and signaling. they also constitute the most abundant biomaterial on earth and have the potential to provide a source of cheap sugars for industrial biotechnology. in lignocellulosic biomass, the cell wall polysaccharides comprise mostly cellulose and glucuronoxylan, a hemicellulose, embedded in highly cross-linked lignin polymers, which protect the polysaccharides from chemical and enzymatic degradation. the hemicellulosic fraction is mostly composed of pentoses , which unlike hexoses cannot be easily fermented by yeast into fuels. two main goals of engineering plants with an altered cell wall composition in order to lower costs and improve efficiency of biofuel production is to decrease recalcitrance by decreasing the lignin content or altering the lignin composition  <cit>  or to reduce the content of glucuronoxylan and at the same time increasing the content of polysaccharides composed of a larger proportion of fermentable hexoses  <cit> .

β- <dig> -galactan is found as sidechains attached to rhamnogalacturonan i and is generally not highly abundant in lignocellulosic biomass. however, since β- <dig> -galactan is composed entirely of galactose residues, which can be easily fermented by yeast, an increased content of this polysaccharide would potentially improve the biomass composition for biofuel purposes. in this study we used a genetic engineering approach to specifically increase the amount of β- <dig> -galactan in stem cell walls.

cell wall polysaccharides are synthesized by glycosyltransferases, which catalyze the formation of glycosidic linkages to form glycosides. during this process monosaccharides from activated sugar substrates are transferred onto glycosyl acceptors. donor sugars are usually nucleotide sugars, while acceptors can be oligo- or polysaccharides, lipids, proteins, nucleic acids or other small molecules  <cit> . recently, the arabidopsis glycosyltransferase galactan synthase  <dig>  was shown to be a β- <dig> -galactan synthase. constitutive overexpression of gals <dig> in arabidopsis wild-type plants led to a 50% increase in cell wall bound galactose in leaves  <cit> . loss-of-function mutants in gals <dig> or its homologs gals <dig> and gals <dig> had a larger decrease in cell wall bound galactose in leaves than in stems  <cit> , which suggested that the supply of udp-galactose might be limiting in stems.

nucleotide sugars are synthesized by different types of interconverting enzymes such as epimerases, decarboxylases and dehydrogenases. most of these enzymes are located in the cytosol but some are found within the golgi lumen  <cit> . changes in nucleotide sugar pools can affect the biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharides, as shown for example for the udp-glucose dehydrogenase  double mutant ugd2/ugd <dig>  which exhibits significantly reduced cell wall arabinose, xylose, apiose, and galacturonic acid levels  <cit> . similarly, the udp-xylose 4-epimerase  mutant mur <dig> has a 50% decrease in cell wall arabinose  <cit> .

the nucleotide sugar udp-galactose is formed from udp-glucose by udp-glucose 4-epimerase . five uge isoenzymes exist in arabidopsis , all of which have been functionally characterized in vivo  <cit> . differences in the expression pattern, kinetics and amino acid sequences of the five atuges suggest that these isoenzymes have an overlapping, but not identical function in plants. uge-overexpressing plants and knockout mutants have been generated, but specific roles for each of the uges could not be unambiguously concluded from those experiments. only the atuge <dig> knockout mutant root hair deficient  <dig>  produces a visible phenotype. roots of uge <dig> mutants are shorter as compared to the wild type, and the root epidermis cells are swollen due to a defective synthesis of xyloglucan and type ii arabinogalactan  <cit> . all five atuges can rescue this phenotype when expressed under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter  <cit> . in double, triple and quadruple atuge mutants, rösti et al.  <cit>  observed growth defects and cell wall compositional changes that suggested a partial functional overlap of the five uge isoenzymes. the authors concluded that atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> affect vegetative growth and cell wall carbohydrate biosynthesis whereas atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> act in stress situations, and atuge <dig> seems to be important for pollen development. analysis of global co-expression profiles led to the conclusion that atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> are co-expressed with putative trehalose-6-phosphate synthase genes, whereas atuge <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> are co-expressed with various known glycosyltransferases and other cell wall biosynthetic enzymes, suggesting that atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> might preferentially act in the udp-galactose  to udp-glucose  direction, while atuge <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> might act in the udp-glc to udp-gal direction in vivo  <cit> .

all uge isoenzymes can interconvert udp-glc and udp-gal in vitro, although they show differences in the substrate affinity and reaction requirements  <cit> . interestingly, two isoenzymes, atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> have been shown to also interconvert udp-xylose  and udp-arabinose   <cit> . this bifunctionality is reflected in the amino acid sequence of the different atuges. phylogenetic analysis of uge homologs in different organisms revealed that uges in plants are distributed in two plant-specific clades with atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> grouping together in clade i, while atuge <dig>  − <dig>  and − <dig> group together in clade ii . besides atuge <dig> and atuge <dig>  the pea psuge <dig> has also been shown to interconvert udp-xyl and udp-ara  <cit> . psuge <dig> is also located in uge clade i, indicating that this clade contains additional bifunctional uges. overexpression of two potato uges  led to an increase of galactose in potato tuber cell walls  <cit>  consistent with the hypothesis that the amount of available udp-gal rather than that of galactosyltransferases can be the limiting factor for the accumulation of cell wall galactose.figure  <dig>

in the present study, we overexpressed different uges from arabidopsis and poplar, in order to increase the level of cell wall galactose and thereby improve the c6/c <dig> sugar ratio. in addition to constitutive overexpression of one poplar and three arabidopsis uges, we expressed one of the arabidopsis uges  under the control of the secondary cell wall specific promoter pirx <dig> together with the master transcription factor nst <dig>  irx <dig> is one of the catalytic subunits of the cellulose synthase complex in secondary cell walls  <cit>  and its expression is induced by the transcription factor nst <dig>  <cit> . expression of nst <dig> under the pirx <dig> promoter has been shown to create a transcriptional positive feedback loop enhancing overall expression of secondary cell wall biosynthesis genes and thereby increasing secondary cell wall deposition in fiber cells  <cit> . finally, constitutive and fiber-specific promoter atuge <dig> constructs were expressed in the background of transgenic plants overexpressing the galactan synthase gals <dig>  <cit> .

while expression of any of the four uges alone did not alter the galactose content significantly, regardless of the promoter used, co-overexpression of atuge <dig> and gals <dig> led to an increase in the cell wall galactose content of stems of up to 80%.

RESULTS
populus trichocarpa ugec is bifunctional in vitro
in order to compare the performance of different uges for the engineering purpose, we first cloned a uge from poplar since it might be preferable to use a poplar gene for the ultimate translation on the engineering approach to a biofuel crop such as poplar. out of the uges encoded in the populus trichocarpa genome, we selected one, referred to as ptugec . due to its higher sequence similarity to the non-bifunctional atuges of clade ii that preferentially act in interconverting udp-glc to udp-gal , ptugec seemed a good candidate for generating higher amounts of galactan. the in vitro activity of purified his-ptugec  was tested in reactions with different nucleotide sugars . proportions of udp-sugars after incubation for 30 min show that the ptugec enzyme is bifunctional, interconverting udp-glc and udp-gal, as well as udp-xyl and udp-ara . the enzymatic reaction does not require the addition of nad+, most likely because of non-covalent binding and co-purification of nad+ together with the enzyme, as it has been shown for the barley hvuge <dig>  <cit> . final udp-gal and udp-glc concentrations were the same in reactions starting with udp-gal or with udp-glc, indicating that equilibrium levels were reached. the reactions starting with either udp-xyl or udp-ara did not completely reach the equilibrium level, suggesting that the reaction rates for udp-xyl/udp-ara interconversion are slower than for udp-gal/udp-glc. the bifunctional enzymatic characteristics of ptugec were somewhat unexpected for a uge belonging to clade ii since other uges from this clade have been found to be specific for udp-glc/udp-gal interconversion. however, structural features that determine bifunctionality vs. mono-functionality are not known yet.figure  <dig>

all uge constructs complement the uge4rhd <dig> phenotype
in order to verify the functionality of uge constructs, ptugec and the arabidopsis atuge <dig>  atuge <dig>  and atuge <dig> proteins were overexpressed under the control of the constitutive cauliflower mosaic virus 35s promoter in the arabidopsis uge <dig> mutant background. loss of function of uge <dig> results in a reduced root elongation rate and swelling of root epidermal cells probably as a result of defective cell wall matrix carbohydrate biosynthesis  <cit> . thus, a simple visual screen can confirm complementation of the wild-type phenotype and thereby not only expression but also functionality of the uge proteins. the four different uge constructs all suppressed the root epidermal swelling and the reduced root length confirming previous uge complementation results published by barber et al.  <cit>  and demonstrating that the poplar ptugec is functional in planta . the slight root length decrease in our uge overexpressor plants as compared to wild type indicates however, that complementation is not complete. expression of atuge <dig> and atuge <dig> resulted in almost complete complementation.figure  <dig>

plants overexpressing uge show no increase in cell wall bound galactose in leaf or stem cell walls
all atuge <dig>  atuge <dig>  atuge <dig>  or ptugec overexpressing arabidopsis plants had a growth phenotype similar to wild-type col- <dig> and the empty vector control plants. the monosaccharide composition of non-cellulosic polysaccharides from leaves and stems was analyzed by high-performance anion exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection . two to four independent transgenic lines were analyzed for each construct in the t <dig> generation. data for one representative line for each construct is shown in figure  <dig>  the transgenic arabidopsis uge lines had no significant changes in sugar composition compared to the empty vector control plants in leaf cell walls  or in stem cell walls .figure  <dig>

recently, we have shown that overexpression of gals <dig> in planta can lead to a significant 40% increase in total cell wall galactose in leaves  <cit> . thus, the udp-gal substrate does not seem to be limiting for galactose incorporation into the cell wall in leaves and therefore an increase in interconverting uge enzymes is not necessarily expected to lead to an increase in cell wall galactan.

cell wall bound galactose levels are increased in stem cell walls of co-overexpressers
since overexpression of atuge <dig>  atuge <dig>  atuge <dig>  or ptugec alone did not result in a significant increase of total galactose in stems, we designed a gene stacking approach by co-expressing atuge <dig> together with the galactan synthase gals <dig>  atuge <dig> was chosen because it showed efficient complementation of the uge <dig> root phenotype . although we had initially preferred to use a poplar uge, ptugec was not a good choice because of its bispecificity and incomplete ability to complement uge <dig>  we designed two different constructs for atuge <dig> expression. one under the control of the constitutive 35s promoter  and a second fiber-specific construct . the fiber-specific construct is under control of the irx <dig> promoter and in addition expresses the transcription factor nst <dig> leading to a positive-artificial feedback loop and increased wall thickness in fiber cells, as previously reported  <cit> . in this construct uge <dig> is expressed from the same pirx <dig> promoter, separated from nst <dig> with the 2a sequence from foot-and-mouth disease virus allowing coordinate expression of multiple proteins  <cit> . the stem cell wall composition was analyzed in the t <dig> generation for three independent lines for each construct. for each construct there was no difference between the independent lines and one line was selected for confirmation of the results in the t <dig> generation . expression of p35s:uge <dig> and pirx5:nst1-uge <dig>  respectively, in the background of plants constitutively overexpressing gals <dig>  led to significantly increased galactose levels  as shown by analysis of the monosaccharide composition of cell walls from stems . while p35s:uge2/p35s:gals <dig> plants showed a galactose increase of more than 80%, the pirx5:nst1-uge2/p35s:gals <dig> galactose levels were only increased by 44% as compared to empty vector control  plants . plants expressing p35s:gals <dig> alone had only a slight increase in stem wall bound galactose, and no galactose increase was observed when the pirx5:nst1-uge <dig> construct was incorporated in the wild-type background. the apparent increase in xylose in plants containing the pirx5:nst1-uge <dig> construct for overexpression of the feedback-loop construct with nst <dig> could be expected in plants with increased fiber cell wall density and more xylan. however, the xylose content in these plants is not significantly different from the control . these results show that gals <dig> is limiting for galactan synthesis in both leaves and stems while uges are not. however, when gals <dig> is overexpressed, atuge <dig> or other uges seem to become limiting for how much galactan can be accumulated in cell walls of arabidopsis plant stems. the 80% increase in cell wall galactose may not be the limit for what can be achieved. udp-gal formed by uge <dig> must be transported into the golgi lumen to be used by gals <dig>  and it is possible that the transport becomes limiting when both uge <dig> and gals <dig> are overexpressed. recently, a udp-gal transporter urgt <dig> has been characterized, the overexpression of which results in increased cell wall galactan in leaves  <cit> . we are currently investigating the effect of overexpressing the transporter together with uge <dig> and gals <dig> figure  <dig>

the increase in galactose of p35s:uge2/p35s:gals <dig> and pirx5:nst1-uge2/p35s:gals <dig> co-overexpressor plants was further investigated by immunofluorescence microscopy of stem sections . although immunofluorescence microscopy is not easily quantified, the detection of the lm <dig> galactan epitope was strongly increased specifically in the secondary cell walls of top and bottom stem sections of p35s:uge2/p35s:gals <dig> and pirx5:nst1-uge2/p35s:gals <dig> co-overexpressors, as compared to overexpressor lines of p35s:gals <dig> or pirx5:nst1-uge <dig> alone, or the empty vector control. the fiber-specific pirx <dig> constructs in addition resulted in highly thickened cell walls as an effect of overexpressing nst <dig> under the irx <dig> promoter and as visualized by lignin autofluorescence using a confocal microscope . on the one hand this increase in biomass density is highly desirable to improve the cost-effectiveness of lignocellulosic bioenergy production. on the other hand however, the increase in xylan rather results in more recalcitrance and is counteracting the increase in the c6/c <dig> sugar ratio, which is obtained due to increased galactan deposition. therefore, future implementation of galactan overexpression could be improved by simultaneously downregulating xylan deposition in fiber cells. this could be achieved by using mutants deficient in xylan that have been complemented by reintroducing xylan biosynthesis specifically into the xylem vessels in order to restore wild type-like growth of the plants, as recently described  <cit> . conceivably, the lignin content in fiber cells also needs to be decreased.figure  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
rescuing of the uge <dig> root phenotype proved functionality of the constitutively expressed poplar p35s:ugec and the three arabidopsis p35s:uge <dig>  p35s:uge <dig> and p35s:uge <dig> constructs. overexpression of any of the four uge proteins alone did not increase the total cell wall galactose content in arabidopsis leaves or stems. however, our gene stacking approach, combining overexpression of atuge <dig> and gals <dig>  clearly showed that it is possible to engineer plants with an even higher galactose content than gals <dig> overexpressing plants by combining the overexpression of multiple genes into one plant. the arabidopsis plants obtained have a more than 80% increase in stem galactose levels as compared to wild-type or empty vector control plants. importantly, these transgenic plants exhibit no impairment of growth and development. our study shows the promise of the gene stacking approach for engineering plants with improved properties for biofuel applications.
