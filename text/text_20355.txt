BACKGROUND
reproductive roles of mads box genes in plants extend from determination of floral organ identity to other floral processes such as control of meristem identity and determinacy, inflorescence architecture, and induction or inhibition of flowering . the current view is that mads domain regulatory proteins accomplish this multitude of tasks by forming higher order complexes, which then act on promoter sequences of their target genes  <cit> . in the simplest model, the higher order complexes are tetramers, or 'dimers of dimers'  <cit> . in this 'floral quartet' model, sepal identity is defined by an aaee quartet, petals by abbe, stamens by bbce and carpels by a ccee quartet, the letters referring to functions of the mads domain proteins in the abc and the extended abcde models  <cit> . other reproductive functions such as meristem identity could be controlled by similar tetramerous complexes in which at least the a and e function proteins are thought to participate  <cit> . however, none of these higher order complexes have been observed or verified in planta, and they could be larger and more extensive than tetramers of mads domain proteins.

mads transcription factors are highly conserved across the plant kingdom and are easily recognizable by the eponymous mads domain, named after the first identified members of the gene family  <cit> . the general structure of the best studied type ii mads domain proteins consists of the conserved mads and the plant-specific k  domains, which flank the less conserved i  domain, and the c  domains. all of these protein domains have been shown to be able to participate in dimerization processes. the mads domain has further dna binding capacity  <cit> , whereas the variable c domain of some, but not all, mads domain proteins contains amino acids that function in transcriptional activation  <cit> .

the first observed mads protein dimer was the b function heterodimer between deficiens and globosa in antirrhinum majus  <cit> . many of the protein-protein interactions defined since then are highly conserved among homologs in both monocot and dicot plants  <cit> . the multimeric protein complexes interact with their target promoter sequences  <cit>  by binding to cis elements with the canonical sequence ccgg, termed the carg box  <cit> . each mads protein can participate in a number of different complexes, making the potential number of combinations, and thus target gene sets, very large. most of the reported protein-protein interactions are between mads domain proteins themselves, but involvement of other proteins have also been observed. examples are the anther-specific secreted protein ata <dig>  the leucine zipper protein mip <dig>  the seed specific histone fold protein nf-yb, leunig, which shares sequence similarity with yeast tup <dig> corepressor, the plant specific regulatory protein seuss, and proteins pfmago <dig> and pfmago <dig>  which are homologous to highly conserved rna binding proteins involved in many developmental processes  <cit> . mads domain protein complexes have also been shown to act on their own promoters to regulate their own expression, and to form autoregulatory loops that stabilize their expression after induction  <cit> .

we have contributed to floral developmental genetics by investigating a model member of the sunflower family, the ornamental plant gerbera hybrida . the highly compressed inflorescences  of the asteraceae family differ from other model systems in that they bear flowers of dissimilar type, showing differences in sexuality, morphology and sometimes coloration. the different flower types combine in the flower head into a second-order structure resembling a single large flower - an apparent pollination adaptation  <cit> . control of flower and inflorescence development therefore has extra tiers in gerbera. not only must the correct floral organs develop in correct places, but also particular types of flowers must emerge along precise radial coordinates of the inflorescence. we have previously shown that many general principles of flower development apply to gerbera  <cit> , and that functional homologues for b, c and e function genes can be identified. however, gerbera also has its own unique features. whereas the arabidopsis thaliana sepallata  genes encode the e function in a redundant and whorl non-specific manner, among several gerbera sep-like mads box genes, a paralogous pair  has apparently undergone subfunctionalization, showing non-redundant whorl-specific functions in stamen and carpel development, respectively  <cit> . interestingly, gerbera mads box genes also show differential expression patterns along the radius of the capitulum, suggesting that different complexes may act on flower primordia to engender their different developmental fates  <cit> .

studies on mads domain protein higher-order complexes have been carried out in arabidopsis, snapdragon, petunia hybrida and tomato  <cit> . our aim was to map mads domain protein-protein interactions in gerbera, and to compare these interactions between gerbera and other model systems. in this study, a total of fourteen gerbera mads domain proteins active  in reproductive development were included in an interaction study using yeast two- and three-hybrid assays. these data, in combination with our previous reverse genetics studies, provide intriguing new information for gerbera mads domain proteins. along with the highly specialized e function proteins grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  gerbera harbors a redundant pair of e function proteins, grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  which have an apparently general non-whorl-specific function. despite functioning as obligate heterodimers  <cit> , b function proteins of gerbera are able to participate in higher order complexes as independent proteins. furthermore, they have an extensive interaction capacity when present as a dimer. the b function proteins show interaction with c function proteins and with all gerbera sep-like proteins except with staminodia-determining grcd <dig>  this might indicate a special role for grcd <dig> as a whorl- and flower-type specific c function partner.

RESULTS
phylogenetic positioning of gerbera mads box genes
of the tested gerbera mads box genes, gsqua <dig>  gglo <dig>  gdef <dig>  gdef <dig>  gaga <dig>  gaga <dig>  grcd <dig>  grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> were included in a phylogenetic tree published previously  <cit>  and were placed among orthologous genes from other plant species. the phylogenetic placements of grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> was further refined by zahn et al.  <cit> , who showed them to be more distantly related paralogs than previously suspected. grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  were added to the data set of zahn et al.  <cit>  and phylogenetic results show them to be related to other sep-like genes . the phylogenetic position of gerbera squamosa/apetala <dig>  -like genes  is reported elsewhere  <cit> . to summarize, gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> group together with ap <dig> and cauliflower  of arabidopsis  <cit> , while gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> are phylogenetically closer to the arabidopsis fruitfull  gene  <cit> .

expression patterns of gerbera sep-like genes
of eudicot mads box genes, c and b function genes generally show a narrow expression pattern, which directly reflects their function in carpel, stamen, and petal development, respectively  <cit> . on the other hand, the arabidopsis sep genes, necessary for several processes in floral development, are widely expressed in flowers  <cit> . in order to gain potential insight into their function and interaction range, the expression patterns for gerbera mads box genes were studied using rna gel blots and in situ hybridization.

the expression patterns for gsqua <dig>  gdef <dig>  gdef <dig>  gglo <dig>  gaga <dig>  gaga <dig>  grcd <dig>  grcd <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  and gsqua <dig> were reported previously  <cit>  .

according to rna gel blots probed with a gene specific probe, strongest expression of grcd <dig> was seen in inflorescence, petals and ovary. grcd <dig> was also expressed in carpel and receptacle and weak expression was detectable in stamens, pappus bristles and bracts . grcd <dig> expression was found to be strongest during the earlier stages  of gerbera ray flower petal development , and only very weak expression was seen at the last stages assayed, 10- <dig> 

grcd <dig> expression was found to be strongest in young gerbera inflorescences  and in petals and ovaries, while carpels and pappus bristles gave a slightly weaker signal for expression in the rna gel blot. weak, but detectable signal was observed in the receptacle and stamens. no signal was detected in the inflorescence-derived green organs , or vegetative organs, which included leaf petioles, leaf blades and roots . grcd <dig> was expressed throughout ray flower petal development, clearly fading toward later developmental stages .

the expression of grcd <dig> was inflorescence-abundant according to an rna gel blot probed with a gene specific probe. grcd <dig> was expressed in all floral whorls, with the strongest expression detected in young inflorescence  and petal samples. slightly weaker expression was detected in receptacle, stamens, carpel and ovary. in bracts and the outmost floral whorl of gerbera, pappus bristles, grcd <dig> was expressed at a very low level . interestingly, the expression of grcd <dig> differs from the expression of  grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> during ray flower petal development. both grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> were expressed at earlier stages of development, whereas grcd <dig> showed remarkable upregulation in the late stages, when the gerbera inflorescence starts to open . our microarray study supported this observation  <cit> .

grcd <dig> was expressed in several floral organs as shown by in situ hybridization. strong expression was visible in ovule, carpel and petals. slightly weaker expression was discovered in stamens and pappus bristles . in situ, both grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> were widely expressed in all floral whorls, confirming the results shown by rna gel blots . overall, the expression patterns for both grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> were remarkably similar.

gerbera sep-like proteins are involved in broad pairwise interactions
pairwise interaction capacity between gerbera mads domain proteins was tested for all combinations of the fourteen proteins using the yeast two-hybrid assay. the gerbera proteins were translationally fused separately to both the binding domain and the activation domain, and were combined in both directions.

as summarized in figure  <dig>  the most broadly interacting proteins in pairwise assays are those phylogenetically grouping with the e function, or sep-like, mads domain factors. grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> each interacted with eight of the fourteen proteins in the interaction screen, including the only two self-interactions  observed among our assays. these factors interacted with all other gerbera mads domain proteins except those from the b-clade , the sep-like protein grcd <dig>  and the ful-like protein gsqua <dig>  in addition, grcd <dig> did not interact with gaga <dig>  and grcd <dig> not with grcd <dig>  both grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> were assayed as truncated proteins due to a strong autoactivation reaction.

grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> have been functionally characterized previously, and they take part in whorl-specific homeotic functions in stamens and carpels, respectively. furthermore, grcd <dig> is required for meristem identity and determinacy  <cit> . compared to the arabidopsis sep proteins, these two gerbera proteins showed a limited interaction capacity in our assays. grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> both interacted with the c-function proteins gaga <dig> and gaga <dig>  as we have previously observed. in addition, grcd <dig> had no other pairwise partners, while grcd <dig> interacted with grcd <dig> and gsqua <dig>  grcd <dig> has perhaps the most limited interaction pattern of the e-class family, interacting pairwise only with grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  grcd <dig> is placed in the outermost branch together with agl <dig> of arabidopsis  <cit> .

the floral homeotic c function genes gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> show similar expression patterns and similar transgenic phenotypes  <cit> . indeed, gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> behaved similarly as well in protein interaction assays, forming dimers with the sep-like gerbera proteins grcd <dig>  grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  gaga <dig> also formed a dimer with grcd <dig> 

the homeotic b function is represented in gerbera by the genes gglo <dig> and gdef <dig>  these genes show strong whorl-specific expression patterns typical of b function mads box genes, as well as characteristic homeotic changes in transgenic gerbera lines  <cit> . gerbera also harbors a tm6-like gene, gdef <dig>  which is closely related to gdef <dig>  but based on its expression pattern and transgenic analyses, apparently does not contribute to the classical b function. recent results indicate that tm6-like genes take part in the control of stamen development  <cit> , also in gerbera  <cit> . the gglo <dig> and gdef <dig> proteins show strong interaction as expected for a pair responsible for the b function. interestingly, gdef <dig> also interacts with gglo <dig> in yeast. in a pairwise interaction assay, these three proteins do not interact with any other gerbera mads domain proteins.

homeotic a function genes have not been described in gerbera - in fact mads box genes responsible for sepal and petal identity as per the abc model have not been identified in plants other than arabidopsis, . nevertheless, gerbera contains several genes similar to the arabidopsis a function mads box gene ap <dig> and its paralogs cal and ful, or its ortholog in snapdragon, squa  <cit> . altogether six squa-like genes have been identified in gerbera  <cit> . full length cdnas for gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig>  gsqua <dig> and gsqua <dig> were included in this study. the corresponding proteins did not interact among themselves in any pairwise combination. all but gsqua <dig> interacted with the sep-like protein grcd <dig>  interestingly, gsqua <dig> also interacted with grcd <dig> in the pairwise assay. grcd <dig> represents another sep-like gene in gerbera, with pleiotropic functions in carpel identity, floral meristem identity and inflorescence determinacy  <cit> .

higher order complexes between gerbera mads domain proteins
plant mads domain proteins are known to bind dna only after dimerization  <cit> . however, their function in the regulation of flower development has been implied to involve formation of higher order protein complexes, possibly tetramers as depicted in the floral quartet model  <cit> . we tested if higher order complex formation could be promoted between gerbera mads domain proteins that did not show pairwise interactions. this was done by introducing a third protein into the system in the yeast three-hybrid assay. for example, sep-like proteins have previously been reported to act as "glue proteins" by facilitating interactions between partners that remain inactive in yeast two-hybrid studies  <cit> . in the yeast three-hybrid assay, care was taken to avoid a positive signal due to a pairwise interaction. however, the assay became uninformative for this reason only in situations where the three proteins all interacted pairwise. our survey was not exhaustive, but out of  <dig> possible  combinations,  <dig> that were considered to be of high relevance were tested. in a few cases, we found out that an activation function emerged when two mads domain proteins interacted. this type of autoactivation  was unexpected but is interesting. in practice, however, it resulted in some uninformative three-hybrid assays.

the gerbera b function proteins gglo <dig> and gdef <dig> formed a closed interaction pair showing pairwise association only with each other. still, the gglo1/gdef <dig> heterodimer is involved in different developmental processes, leading to petal development in whorl  <dig> and stamen development in whorl  <dig>  we tested formation of higher order complexes by fusing gdef <dig>  to the binding domain in pdest <dig>  then providing gglo <dig> as an unfused protein in parc <dig> to the yeast cells, and assaying which gerbera mads domain proteins , fused with the activation domain of pdest <dig>  gave a positive signal when gglo <dig> was already complexed with either gdef <dig> or gdef <dig>  in these assays, both c-function proteins gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> interacted with the gglo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> dimers. all gerbera sep-like proteins except grcd <dig> showed interaction with gglo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> dimers as well, although none of them interacted with the b-class proteins alone. similarly, all gsqua proteins interacted with the dimer gglo1/gdef <dig> - but none of them with the dimer gglo1/gdef <dig> .

these results indicate that gglo <dig>  gdef <dig> and gdef <dig> are activated not only for their  transcriptional function by heterodimer formation, but also for their capacity to recruit additional proteins to form a transcriptional complex. we also observed that all three b clade proteins were, individually, captured into higher order complexes when expressed together with various combinations of grcd and gsqua proteins. further, combinations of a gaga protein and a grcd protein typically recruited the gdef proteins, but not gglo <dig>  in higher order complexes .

the two c-clade genes gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> have been considered similar in their function based on expression patterns and transgenic analysis. also the pairwise interaction patterns of gaga <dig> and gaga <dig> are very similar. the test for higher order complexes with yeast three-hybrid assay showed differences, however. generally gaga <dig> was more active in threeway complexes than gaga <dig>  and in addition they showed complementary specificities in some cases. gaga <dig> was active together with grcd <dig> and gsqua proteins while gaga <dig> was not, and gaga <dig> was active with several other grcd/gsqua combinations where gaga <dig> was not active.

emerging transcriptional activation by complex formation
interestingly, when the dimers gglo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> were combined with an empty activation domain containing vector pdest <dig>  or completely without an activation domain carrying plasmid, yeast growth resulted on plates selecting for weaker interactions . this was unexpected, since transcriptional activation of mads domain protein complexes are thought to be brought on by specific members of the complex, typically proteins of the sep family  <cit> . in order to avoid false results from the yeast three-hybrid assay, we reassayed all sets of binding domain/unfused proteins where yeast growth was observed, irrespective of which mads domain protein was fused to the activation domain . in addition to growth under weak selection for the gglo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> dimers mentioned above, we observed that the combinations gaga1/grcd <dig>  gaga2/grcd <dig> and gsqua2/grcd <dig>  resulted in prominent growth of yeast under strong selection. all of these proteins interacted pairwise in yeast two-hybrid assay, but none of them alone had autoactivation capacity. while obstructing a number of yeast three-hybrid results , this phenomenon is interesting in itself and shows that transcriptional activation may be a combined function of two interacting proteins.

discussion
the major aim of this work was to investigate the interaction capacity of gerbera mads domain proteins using the yeast two-hybrid and three-hybrid assays. in addition, we report expression patterns for three gerbera sep-like mads box genes, grcd <dig>  grcd <dig>  and grcd <dig>  expression of other gerbera mads-box genes has been published previously . although protein interaction in yeast is not always conclusive for interaction in planta, our analysis uncovered intriguing information that can be used to compare and classify gerbera mads domain proteins with reference to those of arabidopsis and petunia, as well as to speculate, in the light of our reverse genetics studies, about the regulatory roles of mads box genes during differential development of flowers and floral organs in asteraceae.

grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> encode general e function proteins in gerbera
e function proteins have been reported to be particularly active in forming heterodimers in yeast two-hybrid experiments in several plant species  <cit> . for example, the arabidopsis proteins sep <dig> and sep <dig> form nodes in the pairwise interaction map and are thought to be responsible for transcriptional activation of a number of different higher order complexes of mads domain proteins  <cit> . at least one of the redundant sep proteins is required for floral organ identity determination where specificity is determined through the combination of a, b and c function proteins  <cit> . in gerbera, similarly to the  e function in arabidopsis, proteins from the sep clade are needed to accomplish correct organ identity determination, and specifically, to mediate the activity of the gerbera c function encoded by the genes gaga <dig> and gaga <dig>  <cit> . as the sep-like gerbera gene grcd <dig> is needed for stamen  identity determination, and grcd <dig> for carpel identity determination, we have concluded that the homeotic e function has evolved into a whorl-specific set of subfunctionalized gene paralogs  <cit> .

mapping of gerbera mads domain protein interactions sheds new light on these conclusions and to the roles of gerbera sep-like genes. while the gerbera grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> proteins have evolved to carry out whorl specific functions similar to the e function in arabidopsis, they have concomitantly lost their general focal position in the interaction map - they interact with a very limited number of other mads domain proteins, in fact nearly exclusively with the c function gaga proteins, for which they were described as necessary companions based on transgenic phenotypes  <cit> .

instead, grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> display a hub-like position in the gerbera interaction map similar to sep <dig> and sep <dig> in arabidopsis . further, like sep <dig> and sep <dig>  grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> harbor transcriptional activation domains based on their autoactivation capacity in yeast, making them the most likely gerbera candidates for the necessary and general, whorl non-specific floral e function proteins. this is supported by their expression analysis, which shows that grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> are expressed in all floral whorls. although their interaction capacity is partly complementary , lack of prominent transgenic phenotypes for either of them downregulated alone  suggests redundancy. specifically, this interpretation predicts that a double transformant  should show a strong  floral phenotype.

grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> provide specialized functions in gerbera
while a general e function is encoded by grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> in gerbera, our interaction data reinforces the conclusion  <cit>  that grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> are specific and necessary activators of the gerbera c function, encoded by the genes gaga <dig> and gaga <dig>  however, the whorl specificity of grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> function remains incompletely characterized. both genes are expressed in whorls three and four, and both proteins interact with gaga <dig> and gaga <dig>  nevertheless, grcd <dig> cannot replace grcd <dig> in whorl three, and grcd <dig> cannot replace grcd <dig> in whorl four  <cit> . furthermore, transgenic gerbera plants in which grcd <dig> is downregulated carry petal-like organs in whorl three of ray flowers , but the stamens of the central disc flowers are nearly normal and male fertile. as we have concluded previously, redundant action by other mads domain proteins may be taking over the function of grcd <dig> in disc flowers  <cit> . unless a very low level of expression for grcd <dig> is sufficient for normal stamen development in disc flowers, we have yet to determine a disc-flower whorl-three-specific grcd1-like c function activator in gerbera.

differential interactions with the b clade proteins
both the developmental and biochemical aspects of b function genes have been found to be highly conserved . b function proteins are necessary for petal and stamen development  <cit> . as gerbera flower types differ in size and development of exactly these two organs, the behavior of b function proteins is of particular interest to us. we have earlier concluded that arrest of stamen development in marginal flowers is not due to differential expression of gglo <dig> or gdef <dig> in developing flower primordia; both genes are expressed strongly at early stages of all flower types  <cit> .

yeast two-hybrid results indicated that both gdef <dig> and gdef <dig> proteins readily form heterodimers with gglo <dig>  remarkably, the b function dimers were discovered to have an intrinsic activation capacity, not present in the proteins when expressed alone in yeast . it is well known that dimerization of mads domain proteins is necessary for their capacity to bind their target sequences  in dna  <cit> , but it has apparently gone unnoticed that dimerization may also render them functional in transcriptional activation, at least in yeast. other proteins are expected to enhance activation by bringing in more activation capacity; however, even without external activation, the b protein dimer is active.

yeast three-hybrid results further indicate that gglo <dig>  gdef <dig> and gdef <dig> are also activated by heterodimer formation for the capacity to recruit additional proteins in higher order complexes. both glo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> heterodimers interact strongly with the gerbera c function proteins gaga <dig> and gaga <dig>  similarly, all gsqua proteins interact with the b function dimer gglo1/gdef <dig>  but none of them with the gglo1/gdef <dig> dimer. the latter is the clearest difference we observed regarding the two gerbera deficiens-like proteins, and it demonstrates that gdef <dig> and gdef <dig> are not simply redundant. instead of the classical b-function proposed for gdef <dig>  expression pattern and transgenic phenotypes for the tm6-like gdef <dig> suggest a role in stamen development  <cit> .

although none of the gerbera sep-like proteins  interact pairwise with the b-clade proteins, all of them - except grcd <dig> - show strong interaction with gglo1/gdef <dig> and gglo1/gdef <dig> complexes. this may speak for a very specific role for grcd <dig> as a whorl- and flower-type specific c function partner. the observation relates to the findings of ito et al.  <cit>  regarding an early, traditional homeotic role of ag in flower organ development, and a late function in anther development. the latter requires postulation of a yet-undescribed activator of ag in arabidopsis  <cit> , providing yet another example where the c function is modulated in a certain developmental context.

single gerbera b clade proteins participate in higher order protein complexes
gerbera b function proteins also participate in trimerous complexes as single proteins. a recent study with tomato proteins showed similar results  <cit> . although gdef <dig> and gglo <dig> are traditionally thought to form an obligatory heterodimer to conduct their joint function, and show dramatically increased interaction capacity when expressed together in yeast three-hybrid, they also show individual interactions with pairs of gaga and grcd proteins. the b function proteins alone are also capable of participating in trimerous complexes where none of the involved proteins interact pairwise. gglo <dig> complexes with grcd <dig> and gsqua <dig>  or with grcd <dig> and gsqua <dig>  as well as with grcd <dig> and gsqua <dig>  gdef <dig> complexes with gsqua <dig> or gsqua <dig> when grcd <dig> is present, and weakly with gsqua <dig> or gsqua <dig> when grcd <dig> is present. it is not clear what roles, if any, lone b function proteins may have in floral development.

the pleiotropic grcd <dig> protein has hidden activation capacity
grcd <dig> has an extended role in flower development and controls carpel identity, floral meristem identity and inflorescence determinacy  <cit> . down regulation of grcd <dig> in transgenic plants affects on all these processes, but ectopic expression of grcd <dig> does not lead to observable phenotypes, indicating that this protein's activity is dependent on additional factors. we have previously observed  protein-protein interactions between grcd <dig> and both of the gerbera c-function gaga proteins, which is in concordance with both the homeotic and floral meristem identity role of grcd <dig>  to our surprise, grcd2/gaga <dig> and grcd2/gaga <dig> dimers showed strong capacity for transcriptional activation, not present for any of the proteins alone. another protein pair which gains marked transcriptional activation upon dimerization is grcd2/gsqua <dig>  g squa <dig> has, unlike any of the other mads box genes of gerbera, a strong flowering inducing capacity when expressed ectopically  <cit> . both grcd <dig> and gsqua <dig> are co-expressed in the young undifferentiated inflorescences at the early stages of development, and later the expression patterns of these genes overlap in several floral organs  <cit> .

a multitude of higher order protein complexes may be critical for gerbera stamen development
based on the protein interactions presented in this study, we propose hypothetical higher order protein complexes involved in gerbera stamen identity determination. for determination of stamen identity, a b function protein pair  is required, along with a c function protein . due to the expression pattern of gdef <dig>  and its links to stamen development  <cit> , the gdef1/gglo <dig> dimer may also be involved. the broad interaction capacity and transcriptional activation properties of grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> suggest that they, or one of them, are needed for development of all floral organs by bringing together higher order protein complexes and activating them. in this scenario, an obvious deviation from the quartet model is that the number of mads domain proteins required for stamen development exceeds four.

grcd <dig> is needed for stamen development in marginal flowers, and in pairwise assays both gerbera c function proteins interact with grcd <dig>  we postulate that even if grcd <dig> does not interact directly with the b function protein pair , one possibility is that it would participate in a higher order protein complex by first forming a protein dimer with a gaga protein. alternatively, the weaker interaction capacity of grcd <dig>  compared to other grcd proteins, could indicate a compromised function, easily competed out by other components necessary for stamen development and eventually leading to release of the developmental arrest in central flowers. data from microarray experiments show that grcd <dig> is in fact upregulated in marginal flowers compared to disc flowers  <cit> .

in vitro data confirming a specific role for mads domain protein tetramers has recently emerged  <cit> , but in planta data is still lacking. combined analysis of interaction between gerbera mads domain proteins indicate that the actual higher order protein transcriptional complexes could be larger than proposed by the quartet model, or  that higher order complex formation in quartets could be transient, with different proteins participating in an alternating manner. relatively broad expression patterns, especially of grcd1- <dig>  and gsqua2- <dig>  <cit> , summarized in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  provide opportunities for both types of increased complexity.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that gerbera mads domain proteins are capable of forming a multitude of higher order complexes in yeast assays. gerbera mads domain protein behavior in higher order complexes displays both characteristics that are common to all higher eudicots, but also specialized features, some of which may be specific to asteraceae and its complex inflorescence structure. for example, in gerbera the e function is split between the highly specialized grcd <dig> and grcd <dig> factors, which are active in stamens and carpels, respectively  <cit> , and a more general activation capacity provided by grcd <dig> and grcd <dig>  in other model species, such division of labor among e function proteins has not been observed to this extent. however, petunia e class proteins also differ in their higher order complex formation capacity, and single mutant analysis shows only minor phenotypic changes  <cit> . in contrast to what has been observed for b function proteins in general, gerbera b function factors  can participate in higher order complexes as single proteins, with the requirement for heterodimerization bypassed. based on the data presented here, we speculate that the differential development of gerbera flower types, especially that of the stamen whorl, requires more complexity than development of flowers in simple inflorescences that bear uniform flowers.
