BACKGROUND
rna secondary structure conformational switches play an essential role in a number of biological processes, such as regulation of viral replication  <cit>  and of viroid replication  <cit> , regulation of r <dig> plasmid copy number in e. coli by hok/sok system  <cit> , transcriptional and translational gene regulation in prokaryotes by riboswitches  <cit> , regulation of alternative splicing in eukaryotes  <cit> , and stress-responsive gene regulation in humans  <cit> , etc. due to the biological importance of conformational switches, several groups have developed algorithms that attempt to recognize switches - in particular, thermodynamics-based methods such as parnass <cit> , rnashapes <cit> , rnabor <cit> , as well as an approach using the second eigenvalue of the laplacian matrix  <cit> .

riboswitches are portions of the 5' untranslated region  of messenger rnas, experimentally known to regulate genes in bacteria by allostery  <cit> , and to regulate alternative splicing of the gene nmt <dig> in the eukaryote neurospora crassa  <cit> . riboswitches are composed of a 5' aptamer and a 3' expression platform. since the aptamer binds to a specific ligand with high affinity , thus triggering the conformational change of the expression platform upon ligand binding  <cit> , its sequence and secondary structure tend to be highly conserved. in contrast, there is lower sequence for the expression platform, which forms a bistable switch, effecting gene regulation by premature abortion of transcription , or by sequestering the shine-dalgarno sequence . due to the conserved sequence and secondary structure within the aptamer, all existent algorithms , such as  <cit> , attempt only to detect riboswitch aptamers, without the expression platform. in addition to these specific algorithmic approaches, more general computational tools that rely on stochastic context free grammars, such as infernal <cit>  and cmfinder <cit> , have been trained to recognize riboswitch aptamers; in particular, infernal was used to create the rfam database  <cit> , which includes  <dig> families of riboswitch aptamers.

since current riboswitch detection algorithms do not attempt to predict the location of the expression platform, we have developed tools, rnabor-sample and rnabormea, described in this paper, which yield information concerning alternative, or suboptimal, structures of a given rna sequence. these tools can suggest the presence of a conformational switch; however, much more work must be done to actually produce a riboswitch gene finder, part of the difficulty due to the fact that riboswitch aptamers contain pseudoknots that cannot be captured by secondary structure.

in previous work  <cit> , we described a novel program rnabor to predict rna conformational switches. for a given secondary structure s of a given rna sequence s, the secondary structure t of s is said to be a k-neighbor of s, if the base pair distance between s and t is k.  given an arbitrary initial structure s <dig>  for all values  <dig> ≤ k < k, the program rnabor <cit> , computes the secondary structure mfe, having minimum free energy over all k-neighbors of s <dig>   as well, rnabor computes for each value  <dig> ≤ k ≤ k, the boltzmann probability pk=zz, where z is the sum of all boltzmann factors exp/rt) of all structures s having base pair distance k from an initially given structure s <dig>  and where the partition function z is the sum of all boltzmann factors of all secondary structures of the given rna sequence. here e is the free energy of secondary structure s, with respect to the turner energy model  <cit> , r =  <dig>  kcal mol- <dig> k- <dig> is the universal gas constant, and t is absolute temperature. in the case that s <dig> is the minimum free energy structure, the existence of one or more 'peaks', or values k ≫  <dig>  where pk is relatively large, suggests that there are two or more low energy structures having large base pair distance k from s <dig> - i.e., a potentially distinct meta-stable structure, as shown in figure  <dig> 

in  <cit> , do et al. introduced the notion of maximum expected accuracy  secondary structure, determined as follows:  compute base pairing probabilities p using a trained stochastic context free grammar;  compute probabilities q=1-∑i<jp-∑j<ip that position i does not pair;  using a dynamic programming algorithm similar to that of nussinov and jacobson  <cit> , determine that secondary structure s having maximum score ∑∈s2α⋅p+ ∑iunpairedβqi, where the first sum is over paired positions  of s and the second sum is over positions i located in loop regions of s, and where α, β > <dig> are parameters with default values  <dig>  subsequently kiryu et al.  <cit>  computed the mea structure by replacing the stochastic context free grammar computation of base pairs in  by using mccaskill's algorithm  <cit> , which computes the boltzmann base pairing probabilities

  p=∑{s:∈s}exp/rt)∑sexp/rt) 

the sum in the numerator is taken over all secondary structures of the given rna sequence, that contain base pair , while the sum in the denominator is taken over all secondary structures of the given rna sequence. thus p is the sum of the boltzmann factors of all secondary structures that contain the fixed base pair , divided by the partition function, which latter is the sum of boltzmann factors of all secondary structures. in fact, kiryu et al.  <cit>  describe an algorithm to compute the mea structure common to all rnas in a given alignment. later, lu et al.  <cit>  rediscovered kiryu's method; in addition, lu et al. computed suboptimal mea structures by implementing an analogue of zuker's method  <cit> .

our motivation in developing both rnabor-sample and rnabormea, was to simplify and improve our previous software, rnabor, in detecting conformational switches. since rnabor computes the minimum free energy structure, mfe, over all structures having base pair distance k from an initially given structure s <dig>  a complex portion of the code in rnabor concerns the retrieval of free energy parameters from the turner model  <cit> . the idea of rnabormea was to compute the base pairing probabilities p - see equation  - by mccaskill's algorithm using rnafold, then to compute the maximum expected accuracy structure, mea, which needs no retrieval of energy parameters, and which we hoped would be very similar to the mfe structure, in light of previously mentioned results  <cit> . surprisingly, it turns out that mea structures are quite different from mfe structures, as shown later in one of the figures.

in this paper, we begin by showing rigorously how to approximate the output of rnabor by frequency counts from sampling, using sfold <cit> . we then extend the mea technique to compute the maximum expected accuracy k-neighbor of a given rna secondary structure s0; i.e., that secondary structure which has maximum expected accuracy over all structures that differ from s <dig> by exactly k base pairs. by analyzing the family of purine riboswitches, obtained by retrieving full riboswitch sequences  from corresponding embl genomic data, by extending the aptamers from the seed alignment of rfam family rf <dig>  <cit> , we show that our software rnabormea produces strikingly different results from other software that produce suboptimal structures .

since the detection of computational switches remains an open problem, despite the success of some tools such as rnashapes and rnabor, we feel the addition of the tool rnabormea could prove useful, since it appears to be orthogonal to all other methods of generating suboptimal secondary structures.

RESULTS
in this paper, we describe the following new results, discussed in the 'methods' section in greater detail with attendant definitions of unexplained concepts.

 <dig>  we describe a python script rnabor-sample that approximates the output pk=zkz of rnabor by frequency counts p ^k from sampled structures, for all  <dig> ≤ k ≤ 2n, using sfold <cit> , or rnasubopt -p <cit> .

 <dig>  we prove that for any desired accuracy  <dig> < ε and probability  <dig> < α < <dig>  if at least

  n=Φ-1p2k24ε <dig> 

structures are sampled, then

  p>1-α 

for all  <dig> ≤ k < k; i.e., rnabor-sample furnishes estimates p ^k of pk, for all  <dig> ≤ k < k, which with confidence  <dig> - α are within ε of the actual values pk. here, Φ is the cumulative distribution function  for the standard normal distribution.

 <dig>  we develop an algorithm, rnabormea, running in time o and space o, which computes simultaneously for all  <dig> ≤ k ≤ k, the maximum expected accuracy k-neighbors of a given rna secondary structure s0; i.e., for each  <dig> ≤ k ≤ k, rnabormea computes that structure sk which has maximum expected accuracy over all structures that differ from s <dig> by exactly k base pairs. the algorithm rnabormea additionally computes, for each  <dig> ≤ k ≤ k, the pseudo partition function

 zk ˜= ∑{s:dbp=k}exp/rt). 

moreover, rnabormea allows the user to stipulate  hard constraints, that stipulate whether particular nucleotides are unpaired, or base-pair with certain other nucleotides. the implementation of hard constraints follows ideas from mathews  <cit> , albeit suitably modified to simultaneously consider all k-neighbors, for  <dig> ≤ k ≤ k.

we now describe the  <dig> figures and  <dig> tables, corresponding to computational experiments performed with rnabor-sample and rnabormea. these tables and figures are only briefly described, and we refer the reader to the captions of the figures and tables, which explain the results in greater detail.

we now briefly describe tables  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  table  <dig> provides some sample sizes n, computed by the formula from equation , for an ε approximation of boltzmann probabilities pk,  <dig> ≤ k < k, with  <dig> - α confidence level. tables  <dig> and  <dig> provide the numerical values for the earlier described figures  <dig> and  <dig>  where the nestedalign structural similarity is computed for the most similar k-neighbor, determined by rnabormea, rnabor-sample and rnalocopt. table  <dig> presents the number of times that each of the methods rnabormea, rnabor, rnabor-sample, rnalocopt, rnashapes, unafold output the most similar structure to the gene on resp. gene off structure for the xpt purine riboswitch described in figure  <dig>  this computational experiment was performed for all rna sequences in the seed alignment of the rfam purine riboswitch family rf <dig>  <cit> . this table shows that rnabormea and rnabor both outperform any other method in determining structures similar to the gene off xpt structure; however, rnabormea uniquely outperforms all methods, including rnabor, in determining structures similar to the gene on xpt structure. one of the reasons for this excellent result is that unlike other methods, rnabormea does not look for low energy structures, but rather for maximum expected accuracy structures.

number of times that the most similar structure to the gene on resp. gene off structure of the b. subtilis xpt riboswitch was produced by each of the six methods investigated. although the test was made with  <dig> sequences from the seed alignment of rfam family rf <dig>  <cit> , the sums of each column may exceed 34; this is because if two or more methods produced the maximum score, then each was counted. structural similarity was measured using the nestedalign structural alignment algorithm  <cit> . while the gene off structure involves a terminator loop, that is often correctly found by thermodynamics-based software, the gene on secondary structure, having higher free energy  is less likely to be found using thermodynamics-based approaches.

the figures and tables show, in summary, that rnabormea provides useful suboptimal structures, which may be closer to metastable structures of a conformational switch than more traditional methods, which rely on searching for low energy structures.

CONCLUSIONS
we have applied the notion of maximum expected accuracy within the context of structural neighbors of a given rna sequence a <dig>  .. ., an and structure s <dig>  our software rnabormea not only computes the structures mea having maximum expected accuracy over all structures s, whose base pair distance dbp is equal to k. in addition, rnabormea allows the user to enter structural constraints, which specify partial secondary structures required of all mea structures, if so desired. additionally, rnabormea computes an analogue of the temperature-dependent partition function, defined by

 z ˜k= ∑{s:dbp=k}exp)/rt 

and

 z ˜= ∑kzk ˜= ∑sexp)/rt. 

here, the expected accuracy score σ is defined by

 σ=2⋅∑∈spi,j+ ∑iunpairedqi 

where first sum is taken over all base pairs  belonging to s, and the second sum is taken over all unpaired positions in s, and where pi,j  is the probability that i, j are paired  in the ensemble of low energy structures, as computed by mccaskill's algorithm  <cit> . finally, rnabormea allows the user to sample structures from the maximum expected accuracy ensemble, in a fashion analogous to ding-lawrence sampling from the low energy boltzmann ensemble, as in sfold <cit> .

our preliminary investigations have not indicated a clear application of the partition function analogue, though it may be construed to provide a representation of the temperature-dependent mixing of various structures having large score σ. on the other hand, in computational experiments reported in the results section, it appears that rnabormea produces near-optimal structures that are closer to the biologically functional structures, in the case of conformational switches that are difficult to predict by any method.

indeed, in  <dig>  out of  <dig> instances, rnabormea produced the secondary structure most structurally similar to the experimentally determined xpt gene on  structure, as measured by nestedalign <cit> . see table  <dig>  since there appears to be little to no correlation between the structures mfe output by rnabor <cit>  and the structures mea output by our current program rnabormea, it appears that rnabormea yields a signal that is orthogonal and complementary to that provided by state-of-the-art thermodynamics software, such as unafold, rnafold, rnastructure, sfold, rnashapes, rnabor, etc. for these reasons, we feel that rnabormea has a certain value, along with the programs unafold, rnafold, rnastructure, sfold, rnashapes, rnabor, etc. when producing suboptimal structures. rnabormea is written in c and available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/rnabormea/ and http://bioinformatics.bc.edu/clotelab/rnabormea/.
