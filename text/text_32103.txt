BACKGROUND
the adult mammary gland of the mouse contains a branching structure of epithelial milk ducts embedded in the mammary fat pad. the epithelial ducts are bi-layered; the outer basal layer consists mainly of contractile myoepithelial cells and the luminal layer contains both hormone receptor positive  and negative  cells. hr+ cells are identified by their expression of the steroid hormone receptors for estrogen and progesterone   <cit> , and they also have a high expression of the prolactin receptor  <cit> . luminal hr- cells are characterised by expression of the transcription factor elf <dig> and already express low levels of milk genes even in the virgin state  <cit> . in the adult virgin epithelial cells rarely proliferate, but the ones that do are usually luminal hr- cells  <cit> . in in vitro assays, hr- cells form colonies whereas the majority of hr+ cells are non-clonogenic  <cit> . together, this has led to the concept that hr+ cells are relatively mature, or terminally differentiated, cells  <cit> . however, ewan and colleagues showed that tgfbeta signaling is actively required to prevent proliferation by hr+ cells  <cit>  and another report documented a 10-fold increase in proliferating hr+ cells in early pregnancy  <cit> . interestingly, a study that used ovarectomized mice treated with hormone injections to mimic early pregnancy in a time-controlled manner showed that there is a short first wave of proliferation of hr+ cells, followed by a larger wave of proliferation of hr- cells  <cit> .

upon pregnancy, there is increased branching of the milk ducts on which lobular structures of alveoli  are formed  <cit> . hr- luminal cells are molecularly primed for milk production and as such are referred to as alveolar progenitor cells. however, these progenitor cells do not provide all the progeny that generate the alveoli. recent data by others and us showed that alveologenesis occurs to a large extent by collaborative outgrowth of the three main epithelial cell lineages; basal cells and luminal hr+ and hr- cells  <cit> . this is consistent with an important role for cellular communication in alveolar development  <cit> .

pregnancy causes an increase in progesterone and prolactin levels and both these hormones are required for the initiation of alveologenesis  <cit> . hr+ cells translate these systemic hormonal signals into local instructions for neighboring cells by paracrine signaling. for instance, progesterone and prolactin induce expression of rankl  <cit> , a growth factor that is essential to induce proliferation of neighboring hr- cells  <cit> . in addition, we found that another growth factor that is essential for alveologenesis, igf <dig>  <cit> , was produced specifically by hr+ in early pregnancy  <cit> . notably, igf <dig> is undetectable in virgin state  <cit>  and therefore we wondered what other factors these cells produce specifically during active morphogenesis in early pregnancy.

here, we analyzed the transcriptome of hr+ cells at two early time points in naturally-induced pregnancy to characterize these cells in a state of active proliferation and cellular communication.

RESULTS
pregnancy induces proliferation in both hr+ and hr- cells
to characterize the changes that occur in hr+ cells in early pregnancy, we obtained mammary glands from fvb/n mice that were adult virgins , and from timed-mated mice at day  <dig> and day  <dig> of pregnancy. carmine staining of the thoracic mammary glands confirmed the presence of relatively bare milk ducts at the virgin state , increased branching and thickening of the ducts at day  <dig> of pregnancy and the appearance of alveolar structures by day  <dig> of pregnancy . we evaluated the proliferative status of the hr+ cells by edu injection 24 hours before harvest. paraffin sections were stained with antibodies against cytokeratin  <dig>  to identify luminal epithelial cells and the estrogen receptor  as a marker for hr+ cells. in this case, we chose er to identify hr+ cells but it is important to note that not all er+ cells co-express the progesterone receptor  and vice versa  <cit> . this can be due to receptor downregulation upon active signaling  <cit>  but potentially could also indicate a further heterogeneity within the hr+ cell population  <cit> . similar to previous literature  <cit> , we found that in mammary epithelium not many epithelial cells are proliferating in the virgin state, and the rare cells that do are all er- . pregnancy induced considerable proliferation of luminal epithelial cells, including the er+ cells . by day  <dig> of pregnancy, the proportion of proliferating luminal cells that are er+ diminishes, whereas the proportion of proliferating er- luminal cells  continues to increase . beleut and colleagues demonstrated that steroid hormone injections first induced proliferation in a portion of progesterone receptor positive  cells, followed by proliferation in a much larger proportion of pr- cells  <cit> . our data show that this response also occurs during a natural pregnancy, in which er + hr+ cells proliferate for a brief initial period, whereas the luminal hr- cells also start proliferating early on, but continue to expand considerably during the course of pregnancy.figure  <dig>

identification of hr+ cells by cell surface markers in early pregnancy
to identify molecular changes during the burst of proliferation of hr+ cells, we isolated hr+ epithelial cells from the abdominal mammary glands of virgin mice at metestrus and 3-day and 7-day pregnant mice. single cells were stained with cell surface markers and isolated by facs. after exclusion of doublets, dead cells and lymphocytes, luminal epithelial cells were identified by their high expression of cd <dig> and relatively low expression of alpha6-integrin . the luminal cell population was separated into hr+ and hr- cells based on sca <dig>  and alpha2-integrin  expression . the proportions of the various facs populations for individual animals can be found in additional file  <dig>  notably, sca <dig> expression went gradually down in hr+ cells upon pregnancy. due to the continued proliferation of the luminal hr- cells, the relative proportion of hr+ cells at day  <dig> of pregnancy is considerably smaller compared to the virgin state . to ensure that the cell surface profiles in pregnancy still identified the hr+ population despite the changes in sca <dig> expression, the two distinct populations were sorted for qpcr analysis. we made use of a direct lysis method we recently developed for mrna analysis of small numbers of cells  <cit>  and  <dig> cells per population were analyzed from three individual mice. there is some fluctuation in hormone receptor transcription during pregnancy , which could be due to changes in transcriptional activity but also potentially to alterations in cellular subsets within the hr+ population  <cit> . note that er protein levels go down in early pregnancy  but er transcript levels do not. because ligand binding induces hormone receptor degradation  <cit>  the relation between transcript and protein levels is not straight forward. nevertheless, this qpcr validation shows that the cd49flo population clearly contains the hr+ cell population despite the reduction in sca <dig> expression. in addition, the hr- population is identified by the expression of elf <dig> and this population does not contaminate the hr+ population sorted based on sca <dig> and cd49b .figure  <dig>

transcriptome analysis of hr+ cells obtained in early pregnancy
to carry out a comprehensive gene expression analysis of the changes that occur in hr+ cells in early pregnancy, we adapted our direct lysis protocol for microarray analysis. in this case, we sorted a thousand hr+ cells per animal and used an aliquot equivalent to  <dig> cells for rna amplification and subsequent hybridization to illumina arrays. note that this cell number is low enough to allow sampling from individual mice even when the cellular subset is small, while the cell number is large enough to provide a robust average of the population without the need for many repeats, as would for instance be the case with single cell analysis. the assumption that a few hundred cells per population provides a consistent representation of the changes that occur within the hr+ cell population is supported by the high reproducibility of the transcriptional profiles of samples taken from individual animals , as indicated by a principal component analysis . unsupervised hierarchical clustering also confirms that the hr+ populations of the different time points are most similar to samples of the same developmental stage .figure  <dig> 
transcriptome analysis clusters hr+ cells by developmental state.  principal component analysis  was performed on three biological replicates of hr+ cells derived from virgin , 3-day  and 7-day  pregnant mice based on  <dig>  probes . a scatterplot of the first two principal components demonstrates a separation by pregnancy along the first principal component  and by duration of pregnancy along the second principal component .  unsupervised hierarchical clustering based on  <dig> probes  of 10% or less) shows that the biological replicates cluster according to developmental state.  venn diagram illustrating the number of genes that were changed more than 2-fold with a fdr of  <dig> in the  <dig> replicates of hr+ cells isolated at day  <dig> of pregnancy  compared to virgin samples and the overlap of this gene set compared to differentially expressed genes at day  <dig> of pregnancy .



at day  <dig> of pregnancy, there is a set of  <dig> genes that have changed more than  <dig> fold compared to the virgin samples and that are distinct from changes that occur at day  <dig> of pregnancy. there is a larger group of  <dig> genes that is changed at both the 3-day and 7-day time point, in addition to  <dig> genes whose expression only starts changing at day  <dig> of pregnancy .

figure 4a illustrates that distinct gene clusters can be recognized based on the direction of the transcriptional changes. for instance, there are genes that are strongly upregulated at day  <dig> but are reduced again at day  <dig> , genes that are induced gradually from day  <dig> to day  <dig> , or become induced only by day  <dig> . similar trends can be observed for downregulation of genes, in which a cluster of genes is abruptly downregulated at day  <dig> , but there are also genes whose expression gradually decreases with the progression of pregnancy  and some genes are only downregulated by day  <dig> .figure  <dig>

response of hr+ cells at day  <dig> of pregnancy is characterized by proliferation and changes in hereditary breast cancer pathways
in our previous work, we noticed that igf <dig> transcription is strongly induced in hr+ cells in early pregnancy  <cit> . analysis of the microarray data shows that additional players in the igf signalling network are also induced , such as insulin-like growth factor acid labile subunit  which increases the half-life of igfs  <cit>  and also two insulin-like growth factor binding proteins  that have opposing roles in mammary gland involution  <cit> . the long non-coding rna h <dig>  whose transcription is tightly linked to that of igf <dig>  <cit> , is strongly induced already at day  <dig> of pregnancy . this seems earlier than the induction of igf <dig>  but that could also be due to differences in detection sensitivity of the array. both igfbp <dig> and h <dig> have been suggested to antagonise igf signalling and therefore these data suggest an intricate regulation of igf signalling in mammary epithelium in early pregnancy.figure  <dig>

an unbiased examination of changes in signalling pathways was performed by ingenuity pathway analysis. the pathways that were most significantly changed in hr+ cells at day  <dig> of pregnancy compared to the virgin samples comprised pathways related to the cell cycle and dna repair check points . interestingly, several of the transcriptional changes at day  <dig> occur in genes that have been implicated in hereditary breast cancer, such as p <dig>  chek <dig> and fancd <dig>  a complete list of the  <dig> genes that are responsible for the significant change in the hereditary breast cancer ingenuity pathway is included in additional file  <dig>  at day  <dig> of pregnancy, changes grouped according to ingenuity signalling pathways were less significant and occurred to some extent already at day  <dig> . these pathways were mostly related to immune function and cell migration and included genes such as integrins and pi3kr <dig>  that were for instance assigned to the ingenuity pathway ‘invasive glioma signaling’.

the individual genes whose transcription is changed most dramatically in hr+ cells in early pregnancy are listed in figure  <dig>  for instance, at day  <dig> of pregnancy several of the most highly induced genes are involved in proliferation . this includes cell cycle genes  and mitotic genes such as pdz-binding kinase   <cit> , kinesin-like protein  <dig> , kinetochore associated  <dig> , nucleolar and spindle-associated protein  <dig> . minichromosome maintenance complex component  <dig>  is a dna replication licensing factor  <cit>  and rad54b plays a role in homologous recombination and repair of dna  <cit> . additional file  <dig> contains a summary of genes involved in the cell cycle that are transcriptionally changed in early pregnancy.figure  <dig>

other top upregulated genes at day  <dig> of pregnancy are known targets of steroid hormones, such as calcitonin  and igfals  <cit> . the genes that are strongly down regulated at pregnancy day  <dig> are mostly similar to the genes that are down regulated at day  <dig>  and they do not cluster into obvious functional groups. indoleamine  <dig>  dioxygenase , an enzyme that catabolizes trypthophan, has a potentially immunosuppressive role and high ido expression in er+ breast cancer is associated with a better overall survival  <cit> . d site of albumin promoter  binding protein  is a transcription factor that for instance binds to the insulin promoter. the sodium/iodide transporter  is negatively regulated by igf- <dig> and tgf-beta signalling in the mammary gland  <cit>  and therefore its down regulation may be a reflection of increased igf signalling.

taken together, at day  <dig> of pregnancy the most striking change in the transcriptome of hr+ cells compared to hr+ in the non-pregnant mammary gland is the induction of proliferation. this is indicated by the ingenuity pathway analysis, the individual genes that change most significantly based on the microarray analysis, and this was further validated by qpcr on some of the cell cycle genes on independent cdna samples .figure  <dig>

transcriptional changes in hr+ cells at day  <dig> of pregnancy involve immune regulation and cellular communication
the expression of cell cycle progression genes is still apparent at day  <dig> of pregnancy, but to a lesser extent. this is consistent with the initial wave of proliferation in hr+ cells that is superseded by proliferation in the luminal hr- cells . part of the overlap in gene changes at pregnancy day  <dig> and day  <dig>  is due to the induction of cell cycle genes, but there are other processes that partially overlap that are only just detectable at day  <dig> and become much more robust at day  <dig>  for instance, the induction of progesterone targets calcitonin and rankl is detectable at day  <dig> of pregnancy, but the fold induction is much higher at day  <dig> . another target of the progesterone receptor , wnt <dig>  is not detectable with the relatively low sensitivity of the microarray but an increase in wnt <dig> expression at day  <dig> of pregnancy can be detected by qpcr . cyclin d <dig> has also been found to be partially regulated by pr  <cit>  but we do not find evidence for cyclin d <dig> induction either by microarray or qpcr . induction of cyclin d <dig> transcription was described 24 hours after progesterone injection, but in that case rna from the entire mammary gland was used  <cit> , implying that the cyclin d <dig> induction could have occurred in neighboring hr- cells.

in addition to elevated cell cycle genes and known hormone-induced target genes, this data set provides insight to other processes that are initiated in hr+ cells at day  <dig> of a murine pregnancy, the time when alveoli become clearly visible . in figure  <dig>  we highlight a few of the top molecules that are all secreted factors . a complete list of transcriptional changes in secreted factors  is included in additional file  <dig> 

wfdc  is a protease inhibitor with a potential role in immune regulation. interestingly, wfdc is part of the same gene cluster as slpi   <cit>  and both genes are strongly induced in hr+ cells at pregnancy day  <dig> . secreted slpi specifically reduces growth of mammary but not colon cancer cells grown in mice  <cit> , suggesting a functional role for slpi in mammary epithelial cells. the role of the induced sftpd  seems straight forward; surfactant secretion prevents the collapse of lung alveoli and likely also of the developing mammary alveoli that become apparent by day  <dig> of pregnancy. in addition, sftpd is thought to play an important role in innate immunity because it binds a wide variety of microorganisms and may modulate leukocyte responses  <cit> . curiously, dmbt <dig>  is also expressed in the lung and seems to interact with sftpd at the protein level  <cit> . dmbt <dig> is induced in inflammatory conditions as part of an anti-microbal defense but it is downregulated in the process of terminal differentiation in gastric epithelia  <cit> . our data show that dmbt <dig> is strongly downregulated in hr+ cells in early pregnancy . in contrast, sftpd is strongly induced and it is currently unclear whether in mammary alveologenesis dmbt <dig> and sftpd are functionally linked. similar to its downregulation in early pregnancy, dmbt <dig> expression is also reduced in breast cancer where its expression was anti-correlated with the proliferation marker mcm <dig>  <cit> . thus, the downregulation of dmbt <dig> in hr+ cells in early pregnancy could be related to an induction of proliferation. taken together, several of the most strongly induced genes play a role in the protection against microorganisms. speculatively, there may be an increased risk for a compromised epithelial barrier during active morphogenesis.

another category of induced genes is involved in cell to cell communication. igf <dig> is a prime example of this , but we also observed the induction of for instance midkine  and il- <dig> and a strong downregulation of il- <dig> . like igf <dig>  midkine is a growth factor  and is widely expressed during embryogenesis but is absent from most adult tissues with the notable exception of the nervous system  <cit> . we show here that it is just detectable in virgin hr+ cells  and strongly induced in pregnancy . mdk has been reported to promote proliferation of cancer cells  <cit> . however, reports about its role in breast cancer are contradictory  <cit>  and warrant further investigation of the role of mdk in the different mammary epithelial cell types in normal and malignant mammary development. the cytokine il- <dig> was approximately 8-fold upregulated in the biological replicates used for the microarray analysis, but the independent validation by qpcr showed a more moderate response . it will nevertheless be interesting to further explore the role of il- <dig> because it induces proliferation and migration of breast cancer cells and the expression of il- <dig> is correlated with a poor clinical outcome  <cit> . il- <dig> is highly expressed in epithelial barrier tissues  <cit>  and thought to act as an ‘alarmin’ that amplifies the innate immune response in case of tissue damage  <cit> . in contrast to the other genes shown in figure 7d, il- <dig> is abruptly downregulated, possibly to prevent an ‘alarmist’ response in case of alveolar morphogenesis. preliminary data suggest that il- <dig> enhances tumor growth in a mouse model of breast cancer  <cit>  and it will be interesting to investigate the role and cellular target of il- <dig> in the mammary gland.

CONCLUSIONS
pregnancy induces considerable changes in the mammary gland, and many studies have characterized this. molecular analysis has been primarily performed on entire mammary glands, thereby blending the characteristics of all cell types of the fat pad and all epithelial cells types  <cit> . sorting mammary epithelial cell populations based on cell surface markers has already provided new insights into cell-type specific transcriptomes of the three epithelial lineages in the adult virgin gland  <cit>  and of the involuted mammary gland  <cit> . here, we have taken that a step further and analyzed the dynamic transcriptional changes within a specific cell population in early pregnancy. we focussed on the changes in hr+ cells specifically, but similar dynamic changes are likely to occur in the other lineages that contribute to alveologenesis. our data underscore that hr+ proliferate as part of a normal developmental program that is active in early pregnancy. estrogen-dependent proliferation is one of the defining features for er+ breast cancer, however this has been considered a newly acquired trait because er+ cells in normal non-pregnant breast tissue rarely proliferate. it will be interesting to explore to what extend er+ cancer cells hijack this developmentally-restricted program.

the transcriptional changes at day  <dig> of pregnancy show a wide range of responses, part of which seem to involve the increase in anti-microbial defense which might be due to a suboptimal barrier function during active epithelial morphogenesis. another part of the response at day  <dig> is likely involved in the coordination of the collaborative outgrowth of different epithelial cell types to form the milk-producing alveoli. many of the most significantly changed genes have a role in breast cancer and given the heterogeneity within breast tumors, where er+ breast tumors can contain as few as 10% er+ cells  <cit> , it will be important to investigate heterotypic signaling in both normal and malignant mammary gland development.
