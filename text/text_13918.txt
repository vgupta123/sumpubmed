BACKGROUND
non-ribosomal peptides are an important class of secondary metabolites produced by a range of bacteria and fungi
 <cit> . these peptides have many biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications such as the antibiotics penicillin
 <cit>  and daptomycin
 <cit> , and the anticancer bleomycin
 <cit> . they are synthesized on large modular non-ribosomal peptide synthetase  and polyketide synthase  enzyme complexes. each nrps module is responsible for the recognition and incorporation of an amino acid during elongation of the peptide intermediate. the basic nrps module has a condensation , adenylation , and peptidyl carrier protein  domains. the adenylation domain is responsible for the selection and activation of amino acids in the form of aminoacyl adenylates
 <cit> . it is followed by the peptidyl carrier protein and condensation domains, the former holding the activated amino acid and the latter making a peptide bond between two adjacent amino acids
 <cit> . in addition, auxiliary enzymes may be present and have activities such as the epimerization, cyclisation, n-methylation, formylation, and reduction of amino acids
 <cit> . the large variety of non-proteinogenic amino acids and hydroxyl acids that can be incorporated and further modified by tailoring enzymes allows the production of highly complex peptides.

microcystins are the most frequently reported cyanobacterial toxins in aquatic blooms. they are small cyclic heptapeptides with extensive variation in amino acid residue composition and are commonly produced by planktonic strains in fresh and brackish water
 <cit> . microcystins are potent inhibitors of serine/threonine protein phosphatases  and can cause human intoxication, tumor promotion, and death
 <cit> . the general structure of microcystin is cyclo . a hybrid nrps-pks enzyme complex directs the synthesis of microcystin and is encoded in the 55– <dig>  kb  gene cluster 
 <cit> .

phylogenetic studies indicate that the mcy gene cluster has an ancient origin among cyanobacteria
 <cit> . other studies suggest that horizontal transfer, gene loss, and recombination events in the microcystin gene cluster explain the distribution and variation of the genes among the closely related microcystis spp.
 <cit> . recombination events affecting the adenylation domain have been described in genes encoding mcya <dig>  mcyb <dig> and mcyc
 <cit> . positive selection acting on the adenylation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc was reported as the possible cause of the large number of microcystin variants produced by cyanobacteria
 <cit> . deletion of the entire n-methyltransferase domain of mcya in anabaena or point mutations in this gene in microcystis were associated with the absence of n-methylation in the microcystins produced by these strains
 <cit> . furthermore, recombination in the same region  was related to the synthesis of microcystins containing 2-amino-2-butenoic acid  in some strains of the genus planktothrix <cit> . such genetic rearrangements, positive selection, and recombination events act to increase the chemical variability of microcystins found in nature. however, the production of the same rare microcystin variant in disparate taxonomic lineages of cyanobacteria raises questions about the genetic mechanism underlying this phenomenon
 <cit> . evolutionary diversification of nrps and pks pathways is achieved through genetic mechanisms such as recombination, duplication, fusion or fission of genes, deletion or substitutions of domains, circular permutations, gene loss and horizontal gene transfer
 <cit> . here, we show that the production of a rare  microcystin  variant in three distantly related genera of cyanobacteria is the result of three independent evolutionary events leading to convergence on the same chemical structure. there is an interest in engineering non-ribosomal peptide biosynthetic pathways in order to increase the production levels of known compounds or create new bioactive compounds
 <cit> . our results suggest that the replacement of entire adenylation domains might be a more successful strategy for changing substrate specificity in the engineering of nrps than point mutations.

RESULTS
production of the mc variant by taxonomically disparate cyanobacteria
we documented the production of the rare mc variant in morphologically disparate cyanobacteria . these cyanobacteria were assigned to the genera nostoc, phormidium and microcystis. nostoc sp. strain uk89iia was identified based on morphology and 16s rrna gene sequence similarity . the phormidium sp. cena <dig> strain has a thick sheath, tangled filaments and small  cells that indicate the presence of similar characters with phormidium, even though the cells in the trichomes are distinctly wider  than their length . the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain cena <dig> was 98% of phormidium sp. dvl1003c, which also produces microcystin. these two strains form a clade with phormidium, lyngbya, oscillatoria and oscillatoriales strains in the 16s rrna trees . the two microcystis strains had previously been identified
 <cit> .

nostoc sp. uk89iia produced four variants of microcystins, while phormidium sp. cena <dig> produced five variants . all of the detected microcystin variants produced by these two strains contained d-leu, and none of the strains produced detectable levels of microcystins that contained d-ala. the two microcystis strains produced at least twelve variants altogether . however, 97% of the microcystin variants in microcystis aeruginosa nplj- <dig> and 80% of the microcystin produced by microcystis sp. rst  <dig> contained d-leu at position  <dig> . we carried out further chemical analysis to characterize the new microcystin variants produced by these strains.

values given as the percentage of relative area of the peaks in the protonated molecular ion chromatograms for the main microcystins variants produced by the studied strain. hil, homoisoleucine. hph, homophenylalanine. har, homoarginine.

in all known microcystin variants, the amino acid configuration is d in position  <dig> and l in positions  <dig> and  <dig> . therefore, the chirality of the amino acids in positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the major microcystin variants produced by the studied strain was investigated by using deuterated acid hydrolysis reagents . this confirmed that the hydrolyzed microcystins contained d-leu .

production of mc-lr by microcystis spp
mass spectrometry strongly suggested that microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig> produced new microcystin variants that contained met instead of d-leu . in order to confirm these results, microcystis sp. rst  <dig> cells were grown with 32s and 34s as the sole source of sulfur. lc-ms revealed an increase in mc-lr protonated ion mass from m/z  <dig> . <dig>  to  <dig> . <dig> , indicating the presence of a sulfur atom in the microcystin, and the same differences could be visualized in the fragmentation analysis . the product ion spectra of mc-lr could be compared with the spectra of mc-lr and -rr . the results confirmed the presence of a new variant of mc in the two microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig>  however, microcystis sp. rst  <dig> produced  <dig> times more mc-lr than strain nplj- <dig>  on the other hand, microcystis aeruginosa nplj- <dig> produced a larger diversity of microcystin variants, but most of them in trace amounts, such as mc-lr and mc-lr.

phylogenetic analysis of microcystin catalytic domains
in order to understand the order and timing of genetic events leading to the production of the rare mc variant, we conducted phylogenetic analysis of the mcy gene cluster. phylogenetic trees based on concatenated mcyd and mcye gene sequences and the housekeeping 16s rrna gene were robust and found to have a similar pattern . strains producing the mc variant do not group together but instead group with strains that produce the mc variant in both trees . we constructed alignments based on the nrps catalytic domains encoded in each of the microcystin biosynthetic genes . the condensation domains and peptidyl carrier proteins of each module encoded in the mcy gene cluster grouped together according to their encoding gene and were placed in separate clades in the phylogenetic tree . a similar pattern was also observed for the adenylation domains of mcyg, mcye, and mcyb <dig> , and the epimerization domains of mcya . however, the adenylation domain sequences of mcya <dig>  mcya <dig>  mcyb <dig>  and mcyc are mixed and do not form separate clades . a phylogenetic tree was constructed using adenylation domain sequences of mcya <dig> and other nrpss obtained from blastp searches of the nr database at ncbi . the mcya <dig> adenylation domains of the microcystis strains were grouped in a single well-supported clade, irrespective of whether they produced mcs or mcs variants. by contrast, the mcya <dig> adenylation domain of phormidium sp. cena <dig> and nostoc sp. uk89iia did not group together with other mcya <dig> adenylation domains. instead, the phormidium sp. cena <dig> mcya <dig> adenylation domain was placed in the same clade of mcyb <dig> adenylation domain of microcystis strains. the mcya <dig> adenylation domain of nostoc sp. uk89iia grouped with adenylation domain sequences from nostoc punctiforme pcc <dig> and nostoc sp. gsv <dig> 

substrate specificity of the mcya <dig> adenylation domain
conservation of the tertiary structure of adenylation domains makes it possible to predict amino acid binding pockets and consequently the substrate specificity. all strains that produce the mc variants analyzed in this study have identical predicted mcya <dig> adenylation domain binding pocket sequences, with the exception of planktothrix agardhii niva-cya 126/ <dig> . there are only two conserved residues  in the predicted binding pocket in strains producing  or mc variants. however, nostoc sp. uk89iia and phormidium sp. cena <dig> have identical predicted binding pockets, differing substantially from those of strains producing mc variants . microcystis aeruginosa nplj- <dig> and microcystis sp. rst  <dig> have identical predicted binding pockets, which differ by three amino acids at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in comparison to strains that activate l-ala . strains producing mc variants have polar amino acids  at position  <dig> of the binding pocket, while strains producing mc variants have hydrophobic non-polar amino acids  at this position .

the adenylation domain of mcya <dig> is responsible for amino acid activation in position one of microcystins.

genetic variations in the mcya <dig> adenylation domain
microcystis spp. nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig>  nostoc sp. uk89iia and phormidium sp. cena <dig> produce the same rare mc variant
 <cit> . recombination events affecting the substrate specificity of the mcya <dig> gene were detected in nostoc sp. uk89iia and phormidium sp. cena <dig> by four different methods . breakpoints with statistical support within the mcya gene were identified in uk89iia and cena <dig> . the identified predicted breakpoints were visualized in a recombination breakpoint distribution plot . a lengthy region replaced in a recombination event in the mcya gene in nostoc sp. uk89iia  and phormidium sp. cena <dig>  was observed in the present study . the predicted binding pockets responsible for amino acid selection and activation were found within this region in both cases.

analysis was performed in the rdp <dig> program and breakpoint positions are indicated in figure

discussion
identification of the rare mc and other microcystin variants
microcystins form a large family of cyclic toxins characterized by a highly conserved chemical structure with an extensive amino acid composition at the two variable positions, two and four . in this study, we detected rare mc variants from strains of the distantly related genera microcystis, nostoc, and phormidium. almost all microcystins reported in the literature contain d-ala in position 1
 <cit> . previously, microcystins containing d-leu
 <cit> , gly
 <cit> , and d-ser
 <cit>  have also been reported. the mc variant has previously been found from microcystis aeruginosa nplj- <dig>  microcystis sp. rst  <dig>  and water blooms from brazil and canada dominated by microcystis strains
 <cit> . the production of microcystins in lichen thalli by nostoc symbionts has previously been reported
 <cit> . nostoc strains isolated from lichen symbiosis produce a large variety of microcystins including the mc variant
 <cit> .

microcystins are best known from aquatic habitats, where they are frequently reported from blooms. although microcystins are more commonly detected in planktonic strains, terrestrial and benthic strains have also been reported to be producers of these compounds
 <cit> . benthic environmental samples containing microcystins have been reported from switzerland
 <cit> , spain
 <cit> , australia
 <cit> , and antarctica
 <cit> . microcystin production in isolated cyanobacterial strains from benthic environments has been reported from egypt
 <cit> , new zealand
 <cit> , and the usa
 <cit> . it is not always clear which cyanobacterium produces the toxin in benthic mats of cyanobacteria. a strain of the genus phormidium was isolated from the walls of a reservoir in the usa and shown to produce a range of microcystin variants, all of which contained d-ala 
 <cit> . our results demonstrated that phormidium sp. cena  <dig>  isolated from a pond in the northeast of brazil, also produces microcystins but with d-leu in place of d-ala. in the phylogenetic analysis of the 16s rrna gene, the two phormidium strains cluster together with lyngbya, oscillatoria, phormidium and oscillatoriales . the biomass of benthic strains can go unnoticed to the casual observer but be massive enough to cause animal poisonings
 <cit> . moreover, when the strains lyse, microcystins are released into the water, which suggests that the analysis of toxic benthic cyanobacteria is also important in water-quality management.

the chemical structure of microcystins is highly conserved, with variation at x and z positions  resulting in over  <dig> reported variants
 <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig> produce new microcystin variants containing methionine in addition to the rare mc variants. met is also present in oscillamide b
 <cit>  and in microcystin-mr and -ym
 <cit> . nodularia spumigena strains also produce nodulapeptins, which commonly contain met
 <cit> . according to analysis using the nrps norine database, met contains a methylthiol group and is rare in non-ribosomal peptides
 <cit> . the presence of the highly active sulfhydryl group in the thiol group could explain the scarcity of secondary metabolites containing met or cys. if amino acid recognition by the mcya <dig> adenylation domain is not strict, the incorporation of met instead of leu is logical because of the similar size and hydrophobicity of the side chains. here, we demonstrated that methionine is incorporated in the microcystins produced by microcystis strains from brackish water. microcystin variants are constantly being discovered, making the microcystin family extremely diverse, and posing a challenge for the detection of microcystins from water samples.

convergence on mc variant chemical structure
phylogenetic analysis of the mcya <dig> adenylation domains provided evidence for independent evolutionary events affecting the substrate specificity of the enzyme in three disparate genera of cyanobacteria . breakpoint analysis suggests the replacement of almost the entire substrate specificity-conferring portion of the adenylation domain in phormidium sp. cena <dig> and nostoc sp. uk89iia. these gene conversions dramatically altered the predicted substrate specificity of the mcya <dig> adenylation domain in these strains and are linked to the synthesis of the mc variant. however, point mutations affecting the substrate specificity of the mcya <dig> adenylation domain in microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig> led to the synthesis of the mc and mc variants.

phormidium sp. cena <dig> and nostoc sp. uk89iia are not grouped together with other mcya <dig> adenylation domains . the mcya <dig> adenylation domain of phormidium sp. cena <dig> grouped with the mcyb <dig> adenylation domain from microcystis strains, which produce microcystin variants containing d-ala
 <cit> . the adenylation domains of nosa <dig> and nosc <dig> from the nostopeptolide gene cluster are placed in the same clade with the mcya <dig> adenylation domain from nostoc sp. uk89iia . they are involved in the incorporation of ile/leu/val and leu, respectively, in nostoc sp. gsv224
 <cit> .

genetic variation in the microcystin synthetases can be visualized in the phylogenetic trees showing two different patterns. while the amino acids of condensation, peptidyl carrier protein, and epimerization domain regions can be grouped according to the enzyme sequence , the adenylation domain phylogeny clearly indicates recombination . recombination in adenylation domains has previously been described for the adenylation and condensation domains of mcyb <dig> and mcyc
 <cit> . the recombination and positive selection in the mcyb <dig> adenylation domain are involved in the high variability of amino acids incorporated at position  <dig> of the microcystin
 <cit> . these genetic events have been related to the increase in the chemical diversity of microcystin. interestingly, our results show that these different evolutionary events are involved in the convergence of the mc-lr.

nevertheless, the selective forces behind this convergent evolution remain unclear. competition in brackish water and different seasonal periods have possibly acted as selective forces. the chemical diversity of microcystins could be related to protein phosphatase inhibition as a form of chemical defense, for example against predators. previous studies have indicated that microcystins can affect some predators, acting as metal chelators, in gene regulation, or in the inter- and intra-specific signaling
 <cit> . however, microcystins join a large number of secondary metabolites produced by different organisms that have no assigned biological function. according to the most accepted view, these compounds are produced due their ecological or physiological function and benefits for the producer organisms
 <cit> . however, more information is still needed concerning the advantages in the production of these secondary metabolites. the biological role of a mixture of different bioactive compounds produced by the same strain would be interesting to study.

prediction of mcya <dig> adenylation domain substrate specificity
the eight to ten amino acid residues forming the adenylation domain binding pocket are the main determinants of substrate specificity
 <cit> . in our study, phormidium sp. cena <dig> and nostoc sp. uk89iia were shown to produce mc variants and have identical binding pocket sequences . such amino acids signatures had been already described as presenting leu specificity
 <cit> . the microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig> differ in the binding pocket positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> from the strains producing mcs. residues at positions  <dig> and  <dig> are regarded to be less variable than at position 331
 <cit> .

the adenylation domain binding pocket of microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig> has three different amino acid residues and a broader diversity of microcystin variants at position  <dig>  despite the fact that almost the entire binding pocket of phormidium sp. cena <dig> and nostoc sp. uk89iia differs from the other studied strains, only microcystin variants containing leu at position  <dig> were detected. re-engineering of non-ribosomal peptides has been a challenge in order to synthesize new peptides or to increase the activity of known compounds. the engineering of nrpss to change substrate specificity can in some cases be achieved by point mutations. however, our results suggest that the replacement of entire domains might be a more successful strategy for producing a single product.

replacement of almost the entire mcya <dig> adenylation domain in nostoc sp. uk89iia and phormidium sp. cena <dig> resulted in specificity towards leu. neither strain produced detectable levels of microcystin variants that contain other amino acids at this position. the recombination detected in the mcya <dig> gene of these strains affects the substrate-conferring portion of the mcya <dig> adenylation domain, which is important for the selection and activation of amino acids
 <cit> . previously, it has been reported that recombination among different adenylation domains from mcyb <dig> and mcyc genes has led to a change in amino acid activation
 <cit> .

we designed an experiment in order to test whether point mutations at positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> could change the substrate specificity of the adenylation domain. however, single amino acids changes did not have the expected results. all the constructs and the wild type were found to activate valine in atp-pyrophosphate  exchange assays. a previous study
 <cit>  demonstrated that in the case of single or multiple mutations, the specificity of the wild type is not lost, but there is an increase in new substrate specificity. a comparison of adenylation domains from microcystis strains that activate ala and leu reveals that several amino acid residues differ between them . of these different amino acid residues, five are  <dig> Å or less distant from the substrate and only three belong to the binding pocket. although it is predicted that amino acid residues in the binding pocket are involved in selectivity, the catalytic efficiency could also be affected by the tertiary structure and proteinogenic surrounding area of the adenylation domain
 <cit> . promiscuity of the enzymes, allowing them to activate different substrates, could also be involved in the high variability of microcystin variants. promiscuous activation of amino acids with a hydrophobic side chain by tyca, involved in the synthesis of the antibiotic tyrocidine a, has been reported
 <cit> . moreover, adenylation domains activating multiple substrates have been described from the fengycin
 <cit> , lychenysin
 <cit> , nostopeptolide
 <cit> , and cyanopeptolin
 <cit>  biosynthetic pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
our study revealed that independent gene conversion events and point mutations led to the production of the same microcystin variant by strains belonging to three different cyanobacterial orders. the large chemical diversity of microcystins is proposed to be mostly the result of genetic rearrangements, positive selection, and recombination acting to increase structural diversity. furthermore, the replacement of the entire adenylation domain seems to result in a more specific change in non-ribosomal peptides than point mutation. new variants of mcs were detected in microcystis strains nplj- <dig> and rst  <dig>  our study also revealed a new cyanobacterial strain  producing a rare variant of the potent hepatotoxic microcystin. this finding expands on the recent increase in the detection of microcystin-producing terrestrial and benthic cyanobacterial strains.
