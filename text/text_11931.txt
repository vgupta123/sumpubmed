BACKGROUND
single nucleotide polymorphism  mapping has transformed studies of genetic linkage in c. elegans since its introduction in  <dig> <cit> . in snp mapping, dna sequence polymorphisms between the wild-type c. elegans strain  and a closely related strain  are used as genetic markers. compared to other markers that have been used for genetic mapping, snps have two distinct advantages. first, unlike conventional marker mutations that cause visible phenotypes, snps in general have no associated phenotype. thus, mutant phenotypes that are masked by conventional marker mutations, such as those with subtle behavioral defects, can be mapped using snps. second, snps are far denser than other markers, including both visible markers and dna polymorphisms such as tc <dig> insertions. because snps are approximately as dense as genes, snp mapping can in theory provide single-gene resolution  <cit> . together, these two advantages have made snp mapping the technique of choice for many c. elegans researchers.

snp mapping is usually done in two phases. the first phase, chromosome mapping, is similar to traditional two-factor mapping and seeks to identify the relevant chromosome and rough position of the gene of interest. the second phase, interval mapping, seeks to place the gene of interest in an interval between two snps, and can be used iteratively to fine map the gene. snp detection in both phases is typically performed by using only snps that alter a restriction site, which are also known as snip-snps  <cit> . although other snp detection methods have been used for mapping in c. elegans, such as fluorescence polarimetry and indel detection  <cit> , snip-snps are attractive because they require low initial investment and do not require specialized equipment. however, snip-snp detection requires pcr amplification of the snp region, digestion with the appropriate restriction enzyme, and gel electrophoresis. these multiple steps can be daunting, particularly during chromosome mapping when many snps need to be assayed simultaneously.

the method described here streamlines the procedure for detecting snip-snps, making faster, more efficient mapping possible. first, we identified  <dig> snps that met our criteria . this means that every part of the genome is linked to multiple snps, so that adjacent snps serve as internal controls, and also that sub-chromosome position can be determined. second, we simplified the pcr step by identifying primer sets that all work at identical amplification conditions, and that are tolerant of being added to reactions by pin-replication. this enabled us to quickly amplify across  <dig> snip-snps in a single 96-well pcr plate. third, we streamlined restriction digestion by using only snip-snps that can be distinguished by a single restriction enzyme, drai. this enzyme is relatively inexpensive and tolerant of pcr buffer salts. this allowed us to perform digestion in the original pcr plate, by adding to each well an identical digestion cocktail. finally, primer locations were designed so that the informative digestion products can be resolved on an agarose gel. the accessibility of this mapping procedure, together with its speed, low cost, robustness, and accuracy, should make it a preferred option for most c. elegans labs.

RESULTS
chromosome mapping
to facilitate mapping a mutation onto a chromosome, we designed a set of pcr reagents based on modifications of the principle of bulk segregant analysis described by wicks et al.  <cit> . our primary goal was to simplify the procedure by performing all steps in a 96-well format pcr plate, and designing each snp reaction to be performed under identical conditions. to design a set of primers that can be used for snp mapping in a 96-well format, two conditions must be met: the primers must all use the same conditions for polymorphism detection, and the primers must all use the same conditions for amplification. first, we simplified snp detection by using only snps that could be detected using a single restriction enzyme. since snps are concentrated in non-coding a/t-rich regions of the genome, we reasoned that good coverage would be obtained from the enzyme drai, which recognizes the sequence ttt^aaa. we identified all drai snps in a custom database  that incorporated all snps identified by the genome sequencing center, washington u, st. louis, mo   <cit>  and by exelixis, south san francisco, ca   <cit> . from among these we selected eight candidate drai snps on each chromosome that were far enough from nearby drai sites  to enable detection of cleavage at the snp drai site. the genetic positions of the resulting  <dig> drai snps are shown in figure  <dig> 

next, to enable simultaneous amplification of all selected snps in a 96-well format, we chose primer pairs with similar annealing temperatures and product length. the program primer <dig>  <cit>  was used to design primers to amplify short sequences  containing each selected drai snp. optimum tm was set to 60°c. primer pairs were tested, and unsatisfactory pairs were redesigned until all  <dig> primer pairs amplified robustly in simultaneous pcr reactions in a single plate. the resulting primer sequences are shown in table  <dig>

finally, we devised a set of procedures that maximize speed and minimize the potential for error during reaction set up and gel loading . our chromosome mapping procedure begins with the same genetic manipulations as other snp mapping protocols. hawaiian males are crossed into the mutant strain to produce heterozygous f <dig> animals. homozygous f <dig> animals from the heterozygous f <dig> animals are identified based on their mutant phenotype. at the same time, animals with a non-mutant phenotype, which are enriched for hawaiian sequences at the locus of interest, are also isolated . thirty to fifty animals of each class are combined into two tubes and lysed using detergent and proteinase k . a pcr master mix, not including pcr primers, is then assembled and added to each lysate. these pcr mixes are then dispensed into alternating rows of a 96-well pcr plate using a multi-channel pipettor . these three simple steps generate a set of  <dig> pcr master mixes ready for the final addition of primers.

because there are  <dig> separate reactions, each requiring addition of a specific primer pair, we generated a pre-arrayed set of primers, which are then added to the pcr master mixes by pin replication. primer pairs described above are arrayed in pairs into a microtiter plate at  <dig> μm each primer , with each row containing the primer pairs for the eight snps along a single chromosome. adjacent rows contain a duplicate set of primers for a particular chromosome, and the plate of primers is pin-replicated into the master pcr mix. after amplification, pcr products are digested in the plate with drai in a final volume of  <dig> μl and loaded onto a  <dig> % agarose gel using an 8-channel pipette. because we use a gel comb with wells spaced half the distance between pipette tips of the multi-channel pipette, we can automatically load the mutant samples from the upper row and wild-type samples from the lower row for each snp pair in adjacent wells. the resulting gel displays all  <dig> snp markers, from left to right and from chromosome i to x . each mutant snp is next to its non-mutant control, so that the whole genome can be quickly scanned for linkage.

to validate the final set of primers for chromosome mapping experiments, we used them to map dpy- <dig>  a mutation with a well known genetic position. we crossed cb <dig> hawaiian males to a triply-marked mapping strain, eg <dig> dpy- <dig> i; rol- <dig> ii; lon- <dig> iii. we allowed the heterozygous f1s to self, and from the f <dig> generation we picked  <dig> dpy and  <dig> non-dpy animals into separate lysis reactions. we performed chromosome mapping pcr on these lysates using primer sets from lgi and lgii . as expected, we found linkage to the center of lgi and no linkage to lgii.

interval mapping
after determining the rough position of a mutation on a chromosome using chromosome mapping, mutations can be quickly mapped to a genetic interval using the same efficiencies of the 96-well format employed in chromosome mapping. interval mapping differs from chromosome mapping in that the genotype of individual mutant animals, rather than the genotype of pooled animals, must be determined. also, it is necessary to assay these mutant dnas for many snps within the interval for which linkage has been established. therefore, it is most convenient to pin replicate the dna templates, rather than the primers .

briefly, we crossed hawaiian males into our mutant strain  to generate a heterozygous strain. from the progeny of these heterozygotes, we singled  <dig> mutant animals onto worm growth plates and allowed them to lay self-fertilized embryos. after the f <dig> progeny had grown to the adult stage, we washed about a quarter of the f <dig> progeny from the plate into individual wells of the 96-well plate . deriving templates from the self progeny of a homozygous mutant has the advantage of allowing each mutant recombinant to be scored as a population, rather than a single animal. also, having additional template is convenient for additional rounds of pcr if higher resolution is desired. we found that 96-well plates containing the lysed worms can be frozen at -80°c and reused successfully after many rounds of thawing and re-freezing. if more rapid mapping was required, we found it possible to remove the single f <dig> animal  and to lyse it for analysis of its snps. specifically, a drawn out and sealed pasteur pipette was used as a pick to place each f <dig> adult individually into  <dig> μl of lysis buffer in a 96-well plate. the embryos on the worm plate could later be used as a source of dna for additional mapping experiments.

lysed dna from each well was pin replicated into 96-well pcr plates containing complete pcr cocktail minus template. each plate included the primer set for a single snp. typically we use plates representing four adjacent snps from the section of a particular chromosome that had shown linkage in the chromosome mapping experiments. for each plate, pcr, digestion and gel electrophoresis were performed as for chromosome mapping.

to validate the technique for mapping a mutation to an interval, we once again used the previously mapped gene dpy- <dig>  we crossed hawaiian males into the strain eg <dig> as described above, and allowed the heterozygous progeny to self-fertilize. from the f <dig> progeny, we singled  <dig> dpy animals onto individual plates. when these plates had starved, we washed each population of progeny into a well containing lysis buffer in a 96-well plate. the lysed dna was assayed using three snp primer pairs from the center of lgi . since each well contained progeny of a single f <dig> animal, it was possible to determine whether that animal was homozygous bristol, homozygous hawaiian, or heterozygous bristol/hawaiian at each snp. from these data we could identify dpy-5-containing bristol chromosomes that have recombined with hawaiian dna to the left of dpy- <dig> , and to the right of dpy- <dig> . keep in mind that each worm contains two dpy- <dig> containing chromosomes, but at regions near the mutation, usually only one is recombinant as illustrated in figure 3c. we found, as expected, that our map data placed dpy- <dig> between - <dig> and  <dig> on lgi at approximately  <dig> , very close to the known map position of  <dig>  for dpy- <dig> . interestingly, one of the  <dig> dpy f <dig> animals showed no linkage to lgi . the plate of worms that had been used to generate that lysate was chunked onto a new plate to verify the dpy phenotype. surprisingly, they were dpy, but less so than dpy- <dig> homozygotes. we have observed that this dpy phenotype segregates at a low frequency from several unrelated crosses between hawaiian cb <dig> and bristol n <dig>  indeed, the plate segregated rol- <dig> animals that were also dpy. this confirms that the phenotype is not due to a dpy- <dig> mutation, since dpy- <dig> is epistatic to rol- <dig>  but apparently the synthetic dpy phenotype is not.

mapping unknown mutations
to illustrate the utility of these methods we mapped a suppressor mutation of a behavioral phenotype. the map data demonstrate that these methods were able to map the original uncoordinated mutation and two other loci that synthetically suppress it in a single experiment. this strain, ky <dig>  was isolated in a screen for suppressors of unc- <dig> . unc- <dig> encodes the c. elegans homolog of caps, a protein required for dense-core vesicle release  <cit> . unc- <dig> mutants are very inactive – almost paralyzed – on food. the suppressor strain ky <dig> moves well, in fact it is slightly hyperactive. the strain ky <dig> was crossed to hawaiian males. heterozygous f <dig> progeny were singled to plates.  <dig> unc- <dig> animals were singled from among the f <dig> progeny. most of these plates of unc- <dig> animals segregated active suppressed animals, demonstrating that the suppressors are recessive. two relatively active animals from each of the  <dig> plates were singled. from among the  <dig> plates,  <dig> plates were found to have the hyperactive phenotype of ky <dig>  animals from these  <dig> plates were combined and used for chromosome mapping. from the chromosome mapping experiment we found that the suppressed unc- <dig> phenotype of ky <dig> animals was linked to three genetic regions, on chromosomes i, ii, and iv . the region on chromosome iv contains unc- <dig>  and linkage to iv is expected since unc- <dig> animals were selected from among the f <dig> generation. thus, the regions on chromosomes i and ii must contain mutations suppressing the unc- <dig> phenotype.

we found that the individual suppressor loci are weak unc- <dig> suppressors on their own. from the unc- <dig> plates we singled animals that were less strongly suppressed; specifically, they were slightly sluggish rather than hyperactive. linkage to the bristol n <dig> genotype in these animals was observed on chromosomes i and iv, while linkage to the hawaiian genotype was observed on chromosome ii . thus, chromosome i contains a novel suppressor of unc- <dig> that partially suppresses the unc- <dig> phenotype. chromosome ii contains a mutation that, in combination with the mutation on chromosome i, suppresses the unc- <dig> phenotype to produce hyperactive worms. further analysis determined that the suppressor on ii could also partially suppress unc- <dig> on its own. to simplify future mapping experiments we mapped the independent suppressing activities of the mutations on chromosome i and ii in the unc- <dig> background. both suppressors were then fine mapped using primer sets on i and ii independently to the genetic intervals depicted in figure 5a and 5b. together, these data suggest that ky <dig> contains two mutant loci in addition to unc- <dig>  these complex interactions were deciphered with a minimum of time, effort, and confusion.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, these methods comprise an accurate and fast technique for mapping that has advantages over both traditional mapping experiments and over other snp mapping approaches that have been previously described. compared to traditional mapping, this technique offers standardized, efficient mapping to small intervals for large numbers of mutations, such as might result from a genetic screen. in addition, it allows the mapping of subtle phenotypes  and complex genotypes .

compared to other snp mapping methods, the technique described here occupies a comfortable midpoint between the simple but less efficient method described by wicks et al.  <cit> , and the high-throughput but complex techniques published by swan et al.  <cit>  and zipperlen et al.  <cit> . although the snp detection technique described by wicks is simple and inexpensive, it requires setting up a number of individual pcr reactions and matching the correct pcr product with the correct restriction enzyme. in the methods described here, once the primers  or templates  are arrayed into a plate, reaction components are accurately dispensed automatically and repeatably. errors in matching restriction enzymes and buffers to primer sets have been eliminated by using drai for all reactions. further, we have found that assaying  <dig> snps on each chromosome means that every mutation is linked to multiple snps, giving a high level of redundancy. in fact, because of its cost and accuracy advantages, our technique has been successfully applied in an undergraduate teaching lab setting .

the fluorescent polarimetry technique described by swan et al., and the indel detection technique described by zipperlen et al., enable high throughput snp detection in c. elegans. however, these techniques require specialized equipment  that are not accessible to every laboratory and that require significant operator knowledge. compared to those snp mapping approaches, the technique described here is cheaper and more accessible, since it relies on methods that most labs already use.

in this paper, we present a happy medium between previous approaches to snp mapping in worms. we build upon the simple, inexpensive, accessible and robust restriction digestion snp detection technique of wicks. however our primer sets, equipment and techniques substantially reduce user effort relative to the wicks method, and so provide the efficiency and low error rate of the swan or zipperlen technologies.
