BACKGROUND
glutamate is the most abundant fast-excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system  and glutamate receptors  play a vital role in the mediation of excitatory synaptic transmission. because of their roles in neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity, glurs are thought to be key molecules in cognitive functions such as learning and memory . based on their structural and functional characteristics, glurs are classified into two major groups: ionotropic glutamate receptors  and metabotropic glutamate receptors  . vertebrate iglurs are pharmacologically classified into four subgroups by their ligand selectivity: nmda, ampa, kainate, and delta. while iglurs directly regulate the ion flux across the cell membrane as ion channels, mglurs are involved in a variety of intracellular signaling pathways by activating phospholipase c and/or suppressing adenlylate cyclase and subsequently mediating excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity by affecting iglur activities.

recent studies have reported that the genetic variations in glurs are associated with multiple neurobehavioral phenotypes in humans including addictions, anxiety/dysphoria disorders, schizophrenia, and epilepsy . these observations suggest that genetic variations in glurs cause brain dysfunctions in humans. a study of the evolutionary genetic changes in the glur genes would provide us with insights into the molecular basis of human-specific brain and nervous system functions.

the evolutionary changes that occurred in the glur genes in the lineage leading to humans are poorly understood, mainly because of the limited availability of relevant information in public databases. to overcome this problem, we determined the complete coding sequences of  <dig> glur genes in chimpanzees  and conducted a comparative genomic analysis of all glur genes. we examined whether positive selection plays a role in the evolution of the glur gene family after the divergence of humans and chimpanzees and investigated human-specific "fixed" nonsynonymous substitutions in the glur genes that might be associated with human-specific brain function.

RESULTS
we determined the complete nucleotide sequences of the coding exons for  <dig> chimpanzee glutamate receptor  genes: gria <dig>  gria <dig>  grid <dig>  grid <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grin <dig>  grin2a, grin2c, grin2d, grin3a, grin3b, grm <dig>  grm <dig>  grm <dig>  grm <dig>  grm <dig>  and grm <dig>  the sequences of five additional chimpanzee glur genes, gria <dig>  gria <dig>  grin2b, grm <dig>  and grm <dig> were obtained from the ucsc genome database   <cit> . successful alignments of the entire coding regions and splice sites of the human and chimpanzee glur genes indicated no gross structural differences such as protein truncation between humans and chimpanzees.

the pairwise nucleotide divergence
we calculated the pairwise nucleotide divergence in total and synonymous sites between humans and chimpanzees for all of the genes encoding nmda, ampa, kainate, delta, and metabotropic glutamate receptors . the divergence for the entire set of glur genes both at total and synonymous sites was  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which is significantly lower than the genome-wide average values, which are  <dig>  and  <dig>  . indeed, except for the nmda type, the divergence for each type was significantly lower than the genome-wide average at total and synonymous sites .

the ampa type genes showed the lowest divergence of the glur types at both total and synonymous sites . the divergence of the four individual ampa genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at total sites and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  at synonymous sites. therefore, the ampa type genes showed lower divergence than the other glur types. the divergence for the nmda type genes was the highest of all of the glur types at both total and synonymous sites . this observed higher divergence can be attributed to two nmda type glur genes, grin3a and grin3b. the grin3b and grin3a genes are the most and the second most diverged glur genes between humans and chimpanzees at both types of site . when we excluded grin3a and grin3b from this analysis, the nmda type genes were found to have similar divergences to the other gene types at total and synonymous sites .

lineage-specific ka/ks ratios and selection tests
intrigued by the possible functional implications of the glur genes in the evolutionary process of the human lineage, we examined whether positive selection acted on the glur genes in humans and chimpanzees. at first, using macaque sequences as an outgroup, we calculated the human and chimpanzee lineage-specific nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates  and their ratios . notably, the ka/ks ratios for the glur genes were less than one in both the human and chimpanzee lineages, although we could not calculate the ratios for  <dig> human and  <dig> chimpanzee glur genes due to the absence of nonsynonymous substitutions. excluding the genes with no substitutions, the ka/ks ratios ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  in human and chimpanzee lineages, respectively. the ka/ks ratios for  <dig> human glur genes and all of the chimpanzee glur genes are smaller than the species-specific genome-wide mean values . these results indicate that the functional constraint on the glur is relatively strong.

ka, ks, and ka/ks indicate nonsynonymous, synonymous, and the nonsynonymous/synonymous substitution rate , respectively.

two maximum likelihood ratio tests  were employed to examine the ka/ks for the glur genes in the human lineage and to evaluate the accelerated selection for the glur genes in humans and chimpanzees. first, we compared the ka/ks ratios in the human lineage vs. background  lineages. we observed that the human-specific ka/ks ratio is significantly different from the background ratio in grm <dig> according to test b outlined in  <cit>  . taking the ka/ks value into account, this result implies that the human ka/ks ratio is significantly lower than that of the background in grm <dig>  we then applied the improved branch-site model  <cit>  to examine whether positive selection acted on the glur genes in humans and chimpanzees, but could not detect any significant accelerated selection in either human or chimpanzee lineages .

identification of human-specific "fixed" nonsynonymous mutations
to evaluate the functional changes of the glur genes in the human lineage, we searched for human-specific "fixed" nonsynonymous substitutions. first, we carried out a pairwise comparison between the human and chimpanzee orthologs of  <dig> glur genes. we found a total of  <dig> nonsynonymous substitutions including four indels  . out of the  <dig> substitutions, two substitutions were excluded from further analysis due to discrepancies among the ucsc reference and our chimpanzee sequences; these two substitutions are possibly polymorphic within chimpanzees. second, we sequenced the remaining  <dig> substitution/indel sites in five additional apes: the bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, siamang, and crab-eating macaque. we regarded human alleles that were not shared with any of the great apes to be "human-specific". we pooled substitutions that were found specifically either in chimpanzees or in bonobos as "chimpanzee-specific" substitutions, because these mutations must have occurred in the chimpanzee and bonobo lineages after the divergence of the human lineage. out of the  <dig> human-chimpanzee substitution sites, we identified  <dig> human-specific  and  <dig> chimpanzee-specific substitutions/indels . the remaining  <dig> are recurrent substitutions in the primate lineages. to determine whether these substitutions/indels are "fixed" or "polymorphic" in human populations, we sequenced  <dig> human samples representing seven different populations around the world for the  <dig> human-specific substitution/indel sites. table  <dig> shows the  <dig> "fixed"  and  <dig> "polymorphic" substitutions/indels that we confirmed in the human populations. the  <dig> human-specific "fixed" substitutions are potentially responsible for human-specific functions.

abbreviations are: hum - human, chimp - chimpanzee, bon - bonobo, gor - gorilla, ora - orangutan, gib - gibbon, in - insertion, del -- deletion, rs -- refsnp accession id.1: this shows the lineage in which the substitution  occurred. in cases in which the substitution independently occurred at the same site in more than two lineages, the specificity is not assigned . we pooled substitutions found specifically in chimpanzees or in bonobos as "chimpanzee-specific" substitutions.

functional implications of human-specific "fixed" nonsynonymous substitutions
to evaluate the functional significance of each amino acid substitution in the glur genes, we calculated grantham's distance  <cit> , a measurement of the chemical drasticity of amino acid replacements. we examined the differences in amino acid substitution patterns between humans and chimpanzees using  <dig> human-specific and  <dig> chimpanzee-specific substitutions after excluding  <dig> indel sites. we classified amino acid substitutions into two groups: substitutions with grantham's distances greater than  <dig>  were classified as "radical" changes and substitutions with grantham's distance less than  <dig> were classified as "non-radical" changes. we found four radical and  <dig> non-radical changes in the human lineage and four radical and  <dig> non-radical changes in the chimpanzee lineage, indicating that there are no significant differences in the amino acid substitution patterns between humans and chimpanzees . we then summarized grantham's distance for each glur gene that contained one of the  <dig> human-specific "fixed" substitutions . among the  <dig> glur genes that have human-specific "fixed" substitutions, grantham's distance analysis showed that grin2c and grin3a are the most diverged in humans from the human-chimpanzee ancestor sequence . four out of the five "fixed" substitutions in grin2c and five out of the six "fixed" substitutions in grin3a are non-radical changes with grantham's distances of less than  <dig>  these substitutions are not located in any particular region, but instead are distributed throughout the entire gene regions . these results imply that it is unlikely that the accumulation of non-radical substitutions in grin2c and grin3a caused their functional divergence from their ancestors.

using the memsat <dig>  <cit>  and myhits  <cit> , we annotated the transmembrane and protein motif domains around the  <dig> "fixed" human-specific substitution/indel sites . we found that ten substitutions are located within either transmembrane or protein motif domains: four in transmembrane domain sites, two in n-glycosylation sites, two in n-myristoylation sites, and two in phosphorylation sites. out of these ten substitutions, there are two human-specific and "fixed" substitutions, d71h in grin3a and r27h in grin3b, which alter the functional assignments of their respective genes as determined by the aforementioned annotation software. d71g in grin3a abolishes an n-myristoylation site that is conserved in other apes and r727h in grin3b generates a novel phosphorylation site for protein kinase c in the human lineage. these substitutions may cause functional changes in human glurs that contribute to human brain function.

discussion
in this study, we examined the evolutionary changes of the glutamate receptor  genes in humans and chimpanzees. we found no gross differences in the coding regions or splice sites of the glur genes between humans and chimpanzees. we also demonstrated that the average rate of protein evolution  is significantly lower in the glur genes than the genome-wide average values for humans and chimpanzees. this pattern is consistent with previous genome-wide studies  <cit> , indicating that strong purifying selection acts on brain-expressed genes including the glur genes due to their strict functional constraint. there are no significant differences between humans and chimpanzees with regard to their ka/ks values  or substitution patterns . these results imply that no gross functional changes occurred in either lineage after the human-chimpanzee divergence.

dorus et al.  <cit>  found an increase in the ka/ks ratio of genes involved in the nervous system of primates relative to rodents when housekeeping genes are treated as a control, leading to the conclusion that the primate nervous system genes have experienced accelerated evolution. our results indicate similar ka/ks ratios between these primate nervous system genes and the glur genes. although our ka/ks ratio values for the glur genes are higher than those of housekeeping genes as discussed in dorus et al.  <cit> , we conclude that the glur genes have been subject to strong functional constraint rather than rapid positive selection detected as accelerated evolution for the following reasons: first, we could not detect any positive selection for the glur genes using the statistical tests reported by dorus et al.  <cit> . although the statistical power of the tests may have been somewhat affected by the scarcity of substitutions, the improved branch-site test can detect single amino acid substitutions positively selected  <cit> . second, there is no local accumulation of amino acid substitutions that could have caused the functional divergence of domains in the glur genes. grantham's distance analyses showed that grin2c and grin3a are the most and the second most diverged glur genes between humans and chimpanzees. however, most of the substitutions in these genes are non-radical and are not clustered in any particular region. third, we identified only two out of the  <dig> human-specific "fixed" substitutions in the assigned functional transmembrane region. this observation strongly supports severe functional constraint acting on the coding regions of the glur genes, especially on the functionally important domains.

niemann et al.  <cit>  reported a common null allele of grin3b with no particular phenotype, indicating relaxed functional constraints on grin3b in the human lineage. however, we observed a low ka/ks ratio  and a low grantham's distance  for human grin3b. gene loss or decay might still contribute to functional changes by modifying the genetic network. in fact, nr3b knockout mice have been reported to show highly increased social interaction with their cage mates in their home cage but moderately increased anxiety-like behavior and decreased social interaction in a novel environment  <cit> . the presence of nr <dig> in nmda receptors has been shown to decrease mg+ <dig> sensitivity and ca+ <dig> permeability, reduce agonist-induced current responses, and give rise to a new class of excitatory glycine receptors  <cit> . these observations suggest that nr <dig> has a significant role in higher brain functions through tetrameric formation with other nr subunits. two out of the  <dig> human-specific "fixed" substitutions, d71g in grin3a and r727h in grin3b, changed the functional assignments between humans and other apes, causing the loss of a myristoylation site and the gain of a phosphorylation site, respectively. since myristoylation and phosphorylation are commonly involved in processes related to synaptic plasticity including long-term potentiation and long-term depression in glutamate receptors  <cit> , these two substitutions possibly affect human-specific brain function by modulating nmda receptor characteristics.

CONCLUSIONS
the results of our comparative genetic study enable us to speculate about the evolutionary changes affecting human-specific brain function that occurred in the glur genes. we showed that strong purifying selection is the major evolutionary force in the glur genes shared by humans and chimpanzees. we identified  <dig> human-specific "fixed" amino acid substitutions/indels including two amino acid substitutions that potentially alter the functional roles of their genes as candidate sites responsible for human-specific brain function. our results are valuable for understanding the molecular basis of the brain and nervous system in humans and help us to clarify human glur functions in in vitro and in vivo experiments.
