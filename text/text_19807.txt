BACKGROUND
testicular development is marked by the development and differentiation of sertoli cells, leydig cells and germ cells. these developmental processes are strictly regulated by a well-coordinated program of gene expression . during spermatogenesis, the genetic information from male germ stem cells undergoes editing and reorganization and is finally distributed into spermatozoa. the most notable functions of this process are performed by numerous testis-specific and/or germ cell-specific genes  <cit> . thus, identification and further characterization of testis- and germ cell-specific genes contribute greatly to our knowledge of spermatogenesis.

rab gtpases, the largest family of small gtpases, are known as master regulators of intracellular membrane traffic  <cit> . in humans, this family is made up of approximately  <dig> members, subdivided into  <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . rab proteins are present in all compartments of endomembrane system such as golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, the nucleus, the plasma membrane, mitochondria and centrioles. in addition to their role in the extraordinary complex membrane trafficking circuit, the characterization of the rab gtpases has revealed their diverse functions . for example, rab proteins have been identified to cross talk with different kinases and play a role in cellular signaling. rab <dig>  rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig>  have been associated with phosphoinositide kinases, rab <dig> have been associated with germinal center kinases   <cit> , rab <dig> and rab <dig> have been associated with protein kinase a   <cit> , and rab <dig> has been associated with protein kinase c   <cit> . rab proteins have also been reported to have other functions, including nuclear signaling   <cit> , regulation of mitochondrial fission   <cit> , regulation of cell-matrix and cell-cell adhesion  and involvement in cell growth and division or apoptosis  .

among the rab family of proteins, only a few are reported to be expressed in the testis. small gtpase rab <dig> is highly expressed in rat sertoli cells and aids in the transport of vesicles from cellular fringe to perinuclear centrosome region  <cit> . rab proteins have also been identified to have an important role in sperm development. rab3a, a monomeric gtp binding protein, is expressed in the acrosomal membrane of mouse sperm and regulates zona pellucida-induced acrosomal exocytosis  <cit> . tbc1d <dig>  a rab gtpase accelerating protein , is abundantly expressed in spermatocytes and is reported to interact with rab <dig>  rab <dig> and rab <dig>  <cit> . recently rabl <dig> has been shown to be essential for sperm tail function and male fertility  <cit> . in addition, rab8b is known to assist in junction dynamics of the testis  <cit> .

in the course of cloning androgen-induced genes from murine testis, we identified a gene encoding a protein with gtpase activity, which is likely a variant of the mouse homolog of human rasef  <cit> . the expression of this gene was testis-specific; thus, it was named tsg . tsg has a well conserved rab domain which provides gtpase activity and classifies it among the members of the rab/ras family. very limited numbers of rab proteins have been associated with the testis. thus, finding and characterization of a testis-specific rab can aid our understanding of testicular development and spermatogenesis.

RESULTS
chromosomal organization of tsg

tsg is present on chromosome  <dig> in the mouse genome. it consists of  <dig> exons, and the translation start site lies in the 2nd exon, while the stop codon is found in the 16th exon . the mrna has an open reading frame of  <dig> base pairs, encoding a protein of  <dig> amino acids. the tsg protein shares 100 % identity with a part of rasef in mouse , the predicted homolog of human rasef. rasef is also known as rab <dig>  and belongs to the rab family of gtpases. the main difference between the predicted mouse rasef and tsg lies in the size of mrna. mouse rasef is predicted to generate an mrna of  <dig> base pairs, which encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids, while the tsg has an open reading frame  of 2159 bp spanning from nucleotides  <dig> to  <dig>  which encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids . the marked difference lies within the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the predicted rasef, which is missing in tsg. this difference is due to the use of an alternative transcription initiation site and the alternative exon  <dig> of tsg mrna, which results in translation initiation at an internal met codon of rasef, thereby restricting the size of protein . tsg shares more than 80 % identity with the human rasef, while the expression of rasef has not yet been confirmed in mouse.fig.  <dig> exonic organization of rasef and tsg. the size of boxes corresponds to the size of exons, while the space between the boxes corresponds the introns for the genomic organization of predicted mouse rasef  and tsg   representation of the first two exons of tsg in comparison with the first four exons of rasef. the in-frame upstream stop codon and the start codon for tsg are underlined with single and double lines, respectively 




expressional analysis of tsg
the expression of tsg was examined in different tissues by northern blot analysis . expression was confined to the testis with no expression in somatic tissues or ovary. tissue level rt-pcr analysis also confirmed the male specificity with expression confined to the testis . northern blotting revealed two larger transcripts that hybridized with the cdna probe of tsg, which could be either tsg mrna precursors, variants of tsg mrna or homologous transcripts including mouse rasef. the expression of tsg in the testis is developmentally regulated, appearing approximately  <dig> dpp . the major change during this period in testicular development is the appearance of haploid round spermatids which appears approximately  <dig> dpp  <cit> . rt-pcr analysis confirms the appearance of the tsg transcript at 19 ~  <dig> dpp, which continues to increase with development .fig.  <dig> expression analysis of tsg in mouse tissues and developing testis. total rnas used in northern blot analysis were isolated from various tissues of adult mice and 28s rrna was used as a loading control  expression of tsg is specific to the testis as analyzed in different tissues of 6-week-old mice by rt-pcr. β-actin was used as an endogenous control  total rnas from the indicated age of developing testis were used for the analysis  expressional analysis of tsg in the indicated aged testis by rt-pcr 




at the protein level, tsg shows a similar expression pattern as the rna. the expression is specific to the testis, but with a higher molecular weight than expected . to verify the size of tsg, we performed in vitro translation using a cdna clone. the result confirmed two different sizes of the protein: the expected size of approximately 58 kda and a second of approximately 72 kda . similar sized proteins were visualized in the lysate of tsg-overexpressing 293 t cells, which was immunoblotted using purified tsg antibody . the expression of tsg in the testis was detected at 24 days . furthermore, immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of tsg in the testis. the immunofluorescent localization confirmed expression, mainly confined to germ cells, particularly in elongating spermatids . tsg transcripts seem to be under translational regulation because the messages are expressed earlier than protein detection, at 19 ~  <dig> dpp when round spermatids are developing. due to the limited transcriptional activity in elongating spermatids, messenger rnas for many proteins expressed in elongating spermatids are actually produced in round spermatids and undergo translational repression until development has reached the elongating spermatid stage  <cit> .fig.  <dig> expression of tsg protein in mouse tissues and developing testis. tsg exists as a higher molecular weight form in the testis  in vitro translation using radioactively labelled methionine clearly shows two forms of tsg produced from the cdna clone after autoradiography. similar forms of tsg were detected using anti-tsg antibody in immunoblot analyses using the lysates of 293t cells transfected with ha-tagged tsg.  stands for samples of in vitro translation using radioactive methionine. empty pcdna ha vector was used as a negative control  tsg expression during testis development

domain analysis
architecture domain analysis of tsg using the smart database  revealed a coiled-coil motif present in the n-terminus of tsg . further motif scan analysis  ascertained the presence of a bipartite nuclear targeting sequence, suggesting that tsg is a nuclear-targeted protein. the coiled-coil motif extends from amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig>  with the nuclear targeting sequence embedded extending from residues  <dig> to  <dig>  the coiled-coil motif region also harbors a tpr/mlp1/mlp2-like domain, which is a feature of myosin-like proteins. the c-terminus of tsg contains the rab/ras gtpase domain, which is evolutionarily conserved.fig.  <dig> structural organization of tsg protein. the n-terminal region harbors the coiled-coil motif and the c-terminus contains the rab domain. bipartite nuclear targeting sequence is located in the middle of coiled-coil motif. the coiled-coil region also harbors the tpr/mlp1/mlp2-like domain




self-interaction of tsg through the coiled-coil motif
tsg is detected at a higher molecular weight than expected in the testis . therefore, we sought to determine whether tsg is capable of undergoing self-interaction and, if so, whether the coiled-coil motif of tsg is involved in that interaction. to investigate this, we prepared full-length tsg constructs tagged with flag or ha and tsg deletion mutants lacking the coiled-coil motif or containing only the coiled-coil motif. ha-tagged full-length tsg was expressed with flag-tagged full-length or deletion mutants of tsg in 293t cells, and the cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-ha  or anti-flag antibody . flag-tagged full-length tsg as well as the isolated coiled-coil domain interacts with ha-tagged full-length tsg, while the tsg deletion mutant lacking the coiled-coil motif loses the ability to interact with full-length tsg. these results show that tsg is able to form multimers through the coiled-coil motif and suggest that this property may be the reason for the higher than predicted molecular weight form of tsg.fig.  <dig> tsg is able to self-interact through the coiled-coil motif. immunoprecipitation using anti-ha antibody  or anti-flag antibody  the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by western blotting using anti-flag and anti-ha antibodies. all ha- and flag-tagged constructs were cloned into the pcdna <dig> vector, and 5 % of the total protein was taken as input. the asterisk  represents the non-specific igg




tsg is a nuclear protein
tsg contains a nuclear localization signal . in addition, immunohistochemical analysis of tsg expression in the testis showed that tsg is localized to the elongating spermatids . therefore, we validated the functionality of the nls using a tsg deletion construct, lacking the most n-terminal region containing the nls. the n-terminus-deleted gfp-tagged tsg clone was restricted from the nucleus and remained distributed in the cytoplasm, while the full-length gfp-tagged protein was localized to the nucleus .fig.  <dig> tsg is likely a nuclear protein. gfp-tagged tsg expressed exogenously in hela cells was concentrated predominantly in the nucleus  while n-terminus-deleted tsg was localized to the cytoplasm similar to gfp  only. nuclear dna was stained using to-pro- <dig> 




tsg has gtpase activity
proteins containing the rab domain have been shown to have gtpase activity. tsg contains a rab domain at the c-terminus; thus, we expected it to display gtpase activity. to verify the gtpase activity, pegfp only or pegfp-tsg fusion protein constructs were expressed in cos- <dig> cells, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated using anti-gfp antibody. the eluted protein was incubated with γ--labeled gtp for 24 h. the gfp-tagged tsg released the γ- from gtp, which was detected by thin-layer chromatography .fig.  <dig> functional characteristics of tsg. tsg has gtpase activity. the extract from cos- <dig> cells transfected with pegfp or pegfp-tsg was incubated with γ- -gtp for 24 h and then subjected to tlc  tsg binds to actin inside the cell. cos- <dig> cells were transfected with gfp only or with gfp-tsg, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp antibody. a total of 10 % of the sample was loaded as input 




myosin-like property
myosin is a motor protein that utilizes the energy from atp hydrolysis to move along the actin filament. tsg has a tpr/mlp1/mlp2-like domain, which is a feature of myosin-like proteins. to confirm the myosin-like property, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation experiment using cos- <dig> cells transfected with gfp-tagged tsg or gfp vector only. the cell lysate with gfp-tsg expression was immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp antibody, and gfp-tsg was co-immunoprecipitated with actin protein, while no such interaction was seen in the lysate expressing only gfp . these results indicate the possibility for tsg to behave like myosin protein.

discussion
several rab proteins and rab effectors have been reported to form oligomers and the self-interacting property of these proteins are important for their function. for example, rilp forms a homodimer to interact with rab <dig>  and disruption of dimerization abolishes its interaction with rab <dig>  <cit> . a family of rab11-interacting proteins  has also been reported to have the ability to self-interact . human rasef has been characterized as a self-associating gtpase localized in perinuclear area of cells  <cit> . the mouse homologue of rasef has not yet been verified, but the predicted protein reported in the ncbi database is completely identical to tsg except for an additional  <dig> amino acids located at its n-terminus and thus is predicted to self-interact as shown for tsg. as per our analysis, tsg is highly expressed in the testis and is a nuclear localizing gtpase because deletion of the bipartite nuclear localization signal restricts its localization to the cytoplasm. conversely the human rasef is ubiquitously expressed and localized to the membrane. both of these proteins share a rab domain at the c-terminus and thus have gtpase activity.

proteins with coiled-coil motifs typically have a role in membrane traffic and have functionally distinct domains at their n- or c-terminus  <cit> . rabaptin <dig>  a large coiled-coil protein, has a distinct n and c terminal domains that binds to rab <dig> and rab <dig> respectively  <cit> . rab <dig>  also called human rasef, has an ef-hand domain at the n-terminus, and a rab homology domain in the c-terminus  <cit> . in the same manner, the predicted mouse rasef has an ef-hand domain as well as a rab domain, but tsg lacks the ef-hand domain, which makes it different from rasef. mouse rasef, if verified, may show membrane localization similar to the human rasef. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that mouse rasef is a nuclear-targeted protein because the bipartite nuclear localization sequence found in tsg is also present in the predicted rasef protein, while human rasef completely lacks this sequence.

human rasef is a  <dig> amino acid protein with an expected molecular weight of approximately 81 kda, but the wild type clone expressed in hela cells was actually observed to be approximately 100 kda  <cit> . similarly, tsg is a  <dig> amino acid protein and is expected to have a size of 58 kda, but it appears as a mixture of both 72 kda and 58 kda; the reason might be its self-interacting property. when we checked the protein expression level in mouse testis, the majority of the protein appears as the high molecular weight form, while a very small, almost undetectable, portion of the expected size is observed. this suggests true functionality of this protein in the testis because most coiled-coil proteins need to self-interact and form oligomers to be functional. such self-interacting proteins lose their function when the interaction is abolished  <cit> . the appearance of this protein in the elongating spermatids after three weeks of murine testis development indicates its importance in later stages of germ cell development. in the course of germ cell development in the testis, round spermatids appear around  <dig> dpp and the condensing/elongated spermatids start to appear around  <dig> dpp. the final spermatozoa are released at  <dig> dpp  <cit> .

myosins consist of atp-dependent proteins that are involved in a wide range of cell motility processes as well as muscle contraction. heavy chains of myosin have three chiseled regions: the motor, neck, and tail domains  <cit> . the motor domain binds to actin in an atp-dependent manner  <cit> . the neck domain accords the binding of light chains and assists as a lever arm to permit movement of motor domain  <cit> . the tail domain is the most variable region of myosins with various lengths and functions depending on the motifs present in its sequence, such as coiled-coil dimerization regions, myth <dig>  ferm, or sh <dig> domains for protein–protein interactions  <cit> . tsg does not have the head region of myosin but it still interacts with actin, which suggests tsg may be part of complex which functions as a gtpase protein. gtpases are known to complex with myosin  <cit> . the rat myosin protein myr <dig> has been described as a gtpase activation protein in vivo  <cit> . tbrab <dig> is a nuclear-associated rab protein that renders stability to nuclear structure  <cit> . there are recent reports identifying multiple rab proteins that interact with myosin va. lindsay et al. screened all human rab proteins for the ability to bind myosin va and revealed an interaction with rab3b, 3c, 6a, 6a´, 6b, 11b,  <dig>   <dig> and 39b  <cit> . this report adds to the previously reported interactions of rab3a, 8a,  <dig>  11a and 27a with myosin va .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have elaborated the expression and localization of tsg, a protein with gtpase activity and self-interacting properties capable of forming oligomers. the germ cell-specific expression of tsg makes it an attractive candidate to address its biological role during testicular germ cell development.
