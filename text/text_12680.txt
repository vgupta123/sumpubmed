BACKGROUND
soon after birth, bacteria colonize the previously germ-free infant gastrointestinal tract. the colonizing bacteria participate to the barrier effect of the gut mucosa, facilitate carbohydrate assimilation, and modulate the immune system. therefore, the establishment and dynamics of gut microbiota have a great influence on the healthy development of the infant. microbiota composition and its dynamics have been described for healthy neonates  <cit>  and to a lesser extent for pre-term neonates  <cit> . knowledge regarding the gut microbiota dynamics in very premature infants  remains limited whereas digestive complications are frequent and life-threatening in this population, particularly in the case of necrotizing enterocolitis   <cit> . in addition, disequilibrium in the gut bacterial community might increase the risk of late-onset sepsis  after disruption of the immature mucosal barrier, resulting in translocation of luminal contents  <cit> .

the impact of some bacterial species on the infant health and growth has been underlined  <cit> . for instance, de la cochetière et al. showed by a molecular-based method that clostridium perfringens appeared in the first 2 weeks of life in  <dig> infants who later developed a nec  <cit> . more recently, unclassified bacteria of the family enterobacteriaceae appeared to be associated with nec  <cit> . on the opposite, bifidobacteria are considered to enhance installation and equilibrium of the microbiota, especially by maintaining the intestinal microbial balance and inhibiting the growth of pathogens  <cit> . however, the role of a single bacterium in health or diseases is doubtful  <cit>  and one hypothesis is that inappropriate dynamics of gut colonization involving distortion and disequilibrium of the microbiota can cause nec  <cit>  and los  <cit> .

knowledge about the microbiota development arising from the chronological follow-up of extremely premature infants stool bacteria was initially based on culture studies. among numerous studies, sakata et al.   <cit>  reported the longer study period  but included only  <dig> infants. other studies usually included more infants  with variable median gestational age   and follow-up period   <cit> . molecular methods have complemented or replaced cultural approaches for the study of complex ecosystems such as human resident microbiota  <cit> . the 16s ribosomal rna  gene-based pcr in association with sequence-specific separation tools such as t-rflp   <cit> , dgge   <cit>  and ttge   <cit>  were used for studying bacterial gut communities in the premature population. more recently, studies based on pyrosequencing technology used deeper molecular analysis of the gut-associated microbiota of preterm infants. these studies revealed previously unappreciated biodiversity  <cit> , including that of viruses and fungi  <cit> . however, this descriptive power is often underexploited, most high-throughput sequencing-based data being interpreted at the phylum level or with a focus on dominant operational taxonomic units   <cit> . exception is a recent metagenomic study that track strain level variations in  <dig> fecal samples chronologically collected in one premature infant .

considering dominant otus and high-level taxonomic ranks, fingerprint-based methods and high-throughput sequencing gave roughly congruent results  <cit> . therefore, results of high-throughput studies validate approaches with lower resolution such as pcr-ttge for dominant otus detection. pcr-ttge allows a snapshot of the dominant microbiota and a monitoring of microbiota dynamics by identification of the dominant otus and analysis of multiple serial specimens in large population of preterm infants. we previously proposed an optimized approach for studying premature infant gut microbiota by pcr-ttge and showed its reliability for bacterial identification and semi-quantitative estimation by comparison with culture  <cit> . this approach demonstrated a positive relationship between the diversity of the intestinal microbiota, digestive tolerance and weight gain in very preterm infants  <cit> .

the aim of this longitudinal study was to describe the temporal dynamics of bacterial diversity in very preterm infant stools by a low-resolution focusing on dominant gut microbiota. thirty infants born before 30 weeks of gestation were included, and a mean of  <dig> stool samples per infant were obtained chronologically from the 1st to the 8th week of life. a total of  <dig> stool samples were collected.

RESULTS
diversity of species-level operational taxonomic units
we analyzed  <dig> samples obtained from  <dig> patients. figure  <dig> shows a representative ttge gel corresponding to the chronological follow-up of the gut microbiota of the infant d. no dna amplification was obtained for  <dig> samples from  <dig> infants . among the  <dig> ttge bands detected,  <dig> corresponded to artifactual bands, mainly heteroduplexes. this result underlined the high frequency occurrence of pcr artifacts when bacterial community was analyzed. if they remained unrecognized, they could lead to overestimated diversity. a total of  <dig> bands  could not be analyzed because they did not correspond to bands present in the diversity ladder and because they were too faint to be cut and sequenced. finally,  <dig> bands were affiliated to a species-level operational taxonomic unit . our approach combining sequencing and comparison to a diversity ladder allowed artifact exclusion and slotu affiliation for about 93% of the bands with a sequencing effort of only  <dig> bands. we identified  <dig> different slotus that reflected the overall microbiota diversity in  <dig> patients. the number of slotus per patient varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  the diversity was probably underestimated because among the  <dig> bands not affiliated to a slotu,  <dig> different distances of migration were distinguished. in a previous study associating ttge and cloning/sequencing approaches,  <dig> clones were sequenced and  <dig> different slotus were described  <cit> . a comprehensive culture-based study of the microbiota of preterm neonates of less than 1000 g surveyed during 30 days showed a total diversity of  <dig> bacterial species  <cit> . comparatively with these previous approaches, we describe a wider bacterial diversity in stool samples of preterm neonates.figure  <dig>

the  <dig> slotus were distributed in  <dig> genera or families named genus-level operational taxonomic unit , which were defined on the basis of bacterial taxonomy . the genera escherichia, enterobacter and klebsiella were grouped in enterobacteriaceae owing to the 16s rrna gene relatedness among the genera of this family. the species clostridium innocuum was affiliated to erysipelotrichaceae because it does not belong to the genus clostridium despite confusing nomenclature. the ttge bands were distributed in each glotu as presented in figure  <dig>  seven glotus represented from  <dig> % to  <dig> % of total ttge bands, staphylococcus, clostridium enterococcus, veillonella, enterobacteriaceae, streptococcus and bifidobacterium. each other glotu represented 1% or less of the total ttge bands .table  <dig>

as expected, pyrosequencing approaches detected more slotus but most of them belonged to minority populations, each representing less than 1% of the total diversity  <cit> . again, higher genus-level diversity was reported with high-throughput sequencing methods revealing up to  <dig> genera in the fecal microbiota of premature infants  <cit> . however, latuga et al.  <cit>  showed that  <dig> to  <dig> genera out of the  <dig> found in their study comprised over 90% of the sequences in most individual samples  <cit> .

to determine the relative repartition of high-level taxa per patient, the glotus were grouped in their corresponding phylum or class for the phylum firmicutes to form plotus . the bacteria described belonged to the  <dig> following plotus: phyla actinobacteria, proteobacteria, fusobacteria and classes bacilli, clostridia and negativicutes in the phylum firmicutes. although most patients carried only  <dig> to  <dig> plotus, we observed important variations among patients . the firmicutes represented the large majority of slotus in all patients and  <dig> patients harboured only firmicutes. bacilli was the sole and generally predominating plotu found in all neonates and was the only plotu recovered in  <dig> patients. beside bacilli, clostridia was the most represented plotu found in  <dig> neonates. finally, gram-positive bacteria largely dominated the bacterial community since they represented 88% of the identified slotus.figure  <dig> 
relative abundance of high-level taxa per patient.




high-throughput sequencing methods revealed higher diversity than we observed herein but the  <dig> dominant phyla  were concordantly found  <cit> . however, discrepancies between studies were observed for the phylum bacteroidetes, most often found as a rarely represented phylum while representing about 8% of the sequences in the study by mai et al.  <cit> . surprisingly, members of the phylum fusobacteria found in our study were not reported by these sequencing-based studies  <cit> . the phylum diversity was not markedly higher in the gut microbiota of adults and infants. ten phyla were detected in the stool specimens of the  <dig> adults included in the human microbiome project but this number generally decreases to  <dig> to  <dig> phyla if each subject is considered  <cit> .

in adults and weaning children, bacteroidetes is the major bacterial phylum constituent of the gut microbiota followed by firmicutes such as eubacterium, ruminococcus and clostridium. in the extreme premature neonates studied herein, firmicutes appeared the major component of the gut microbiota but bacteroidetes were unrepresented . members of firmicutes differed from those described in adults since the class bacilli with the genera staphylococcus, streptococcus and enterococccus was the most represented. members of the class negativicutes were also well represented.

finally, although pcr-ttge lacks sensitivity in the detection of minority population, major glotus and plotus were detected in accordance with molecular methods with higher throughput.

dynamics of extremely premature infant gut microbiota
we studied the repartition of the  <dig> major glotus per infant and per age post-delivery. the figure 4a shows the relative proportion of infants displaying each major glotu and the weekly development of the glotus’ occurence. the only glotu shared by all the infants and found in more than 75% of the analysed samples was staphylococcus spp. the percentage of infants colonized with enterococci, clostridia and enterobacteria increased over the survey period, markedly towards the 5th week of life when the percentage of neonates carrying staphylococci began to decrease. the increase in members of the family enterobacteriaceae was slightly delayed compared to the gram-postive bacteria, enterococci and clostridia. in a previous study, we showed a global congruence between a semi-quantitative score calculated from intensity of ttge bands and the number of colony-forming units , thereby validating the semi-quantitative approach based on band intensity  <cit> . we explored here the semi-quantitative dynamics of the major glotus detected in the gut flora of the  <dig> neonates . we showed that staphylococcus, enterococcus and enterobacteriaceae successively dominated the very preterm neonate gut microbiota. indeed, the semi-quantitative approach showed that staphylococcus was the predominant population for the first 3 weeks of life followed by enterococci from the 4th to the 6th week of life and then by enterobacteria . semi-quantification of clostridium showed they did not vary significantly over time . detailed microbiota composition over time is given for the  <dig> patients in the additional file 1: table s <dig> together with semi-quantitative scores deduced from band intensity for each otu occurrence . less than 25% of the patients carried each minor glotu whatever the date after delivery and their qualitative or semi-quantitative  representation did not change significantly with the date of sampling.figure  <dig>

staphylococci dominate the extremely premature infants gut microbiota
the genus staphylococcus represented  <dig> % of bands affiliated to a slotu . all infants carried staphylococcus spp. at least once over the follow-up period. up to four staphylococcal otus may be found in an infant  but successive or concomitant colonization by  <dig> otus was observed in most infants . for most neonates, staphylococci appeared during the first week of life and persisted up to the 8th week post-delivery with a slight decrease in colonized infants after the 4th week . the semi-quantitative approach showed that staphylococci quantitatively dominate the gut microbiota up to the third week of life . most of the staphylococci were coagulase-negative staphylococci  belonging to the s. epidermidis genomic group defined by dna-dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene phylogeny that included s. epidermidis, s. caprae, s. capitis, s. aureus and staphylococcus warneri  <cit> . in this group of genetically very related species, s. warneri displayed particular ttge behaviour and therefore could be identified separately. different behaviours were observed for the cons species found in this study. contrarily to other species, s. warneri was only found in the first month of life . colonization by a cons species may be transient as observed for s. warneri but also for s. hominis and staphylococcus cohnii while s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus usually appeared as persistent colonizers over the study period. after first detection, these two species were indeed found in more than 50% of the subsequent samples in  <dig> out of the  <dig> and in  <dig> out of the  <dig> infants colonized by each species, respectively.

cons predominance could be considered as a specific trait of the extremely premature infant gut microbiota fed by human pasteurised milk since staphylococci appeared as a minor or an unrepresented population in the gut community of adults  <cit>  or infants born at term, whatever their feeding pattern  <cit> . cons have received a marginal attention for their role in the early colonization of the premature and extremely premature infant gut microbiota. few studies reported the detection of cons in neonate stools by culture, with controversial results concerning the load and the prevalence of these bacteria  <cit> . molecular-based studies also detected staphylococci that seemed to dominate the extremely premature infant gut microbiota in the first weeks of life  <cit> . in these studies, predominance of cons was observed in only few cases due a low number of extremely preterm neonates included  <cit>  or to the low sampling effort in each patient  <cit> .

cons also retained attention since they are the major cause of los in neonatal intensive care unit   <cit> . cons were supposedly acquired postnatally  <cit>  and sometimes during nosocomial outbreaks  <cit> . the gut has recently been described as a reservoir of cons implicated in late-onset infections of extremely premature infants  <cit>  and distortion in gut microbiota seemed to be related to los  <cit> . the breast-feeding origin of the neonate gut colonization by cons has been suspected because of the high prevalence of s. epidermidis in the milk of lactating women  <cit> .

clostridium spp
 <dig> % of the ttge bands obtained in this study corresponded to sequences affiliated to clostridium spp. the genus clostridium appeared as the most diverse since it was represented by  <dig> different slotus . clostridium difficile , clostridium neonatale , clostridium butyricum  and clostridium perfringens  were the most represented slotus. each other minor clostridium slotu was found in  <dig> to  <dig> patients. infants may be colonized by up to  <dig> clostridial otus  but more frequently harboured  <dig>  to  <dig>  otus during the study period. clostridium represented qualitatively a major group among the premature neonate gut microbial community , colonizing 70%  of the infants over the study period. the percent of clostridium colonization of premature neonates is congruent with the result obtained by stool culture   <cit> . the colonization began on the second week of life, then the number of colonized infants increased regularly from the 4th to the 6th week of life reaching 50% of neonates colonized by clostridium spp. the semi-quantitative approach showed that clostridium spp. represented a relatively important bacterial population as soon as they appeared and that bacterial load appeared stable over the survey period . considering otus shared by  <dig> infants or more, transient or persistent colonization was observed for the major clostridial otus  and clostridium tertium depending on the infants while clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium disporicum group appeared as transient colonizers only.

c. difficile is a recognized pathogen since the toxinogenic strains cause severe enterocolitis and antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. the species represent up to 50% of the bacterial species isolated from infants, particularly from formula-fed infants  <cit> . in breast-fed infants c. difficile represented from 6% to 20% of the cultivated micro-organisms  <cit> . healthy neonates may harbour c. difficile and its toxins without apparent pathologic consequences  <cit> . in our population, about 1/ <dig> of very preterm neonates were colonized by c. difficile. “clostridium neonatale” is a non-validated species described during a nicu outbreak where  <dig> % of neonates carried the same “c. neonatale” strain  <cit> . we showed that out of an epidemic context, 1/ <dig> of our patients were colonized by c. neonatale. the role of c. neonatale and its specificity for the neonate microbiota need to be explored. clostridium spp., particularly c. perfringens  <cit> , c. difficile  <cit>  and c. butyricum  <cit>  have been related to nec. we showed that these otus frequently colonized the neonates included in this study. one patient developed a nec, c. butyricum was detected twice, at the onset of the clinical signs and at day  <dig> after the onset of nec .

enterococcus spp
slotus affiliated to the genus enterococcus were among the most represented  and were found in  <dig> out of the  <dig> infants . however, diversity of enterococcal otus was rather low with  <dig> slotus found during the study: enterococcus faecalis which was the most represented and enterococcus durans group . among the population, only  <dig> patients  were successively or simultaneously colonized by these  <dig> slotus. at the first week of life, 13% of the patients were colonized. the level of colonization increased regularly over time, about half of the patients being colonized at the 5th week of life and up to 77% at the 8th week . the semi-quantitative evaluation showed that enterococci were the second dominating genus of the very premature gut microbiota after staphylococci up to the 3rd week of life. then, enterococci became quantitatively the major population during the following 3 weeks of life.

despite inter-individual variations  <cit> , enterococci were found among the main groups encountered in the gut microbiota of preterm infants  <cit>  and represented one of the main groups during initial colonization in healthy infants in other molecular-based studies  <cit> . as observed herein, culture-based studies previously showed early enterococcal colonization that increased over time with a dynamic roughly similar to enterobacteria colonization   <cit> , even if the quantitative increase in enterobacteria was delayed relative to enterococci . however, in our population, the level of colonization was slightly lower than previously described in culture-based studies. for example, enterococcal colonization was shown by hufnagel et al.   <cit>  in 23% of the patients admitted to a nicu. in another instance, at the end of the first week of life, enterococci were isolated from stools of a large majority  of the preterm infants  <cit> . persistant colonization was the most frequent finding for enterococcus otus found in this study, observed in 83% of the infants harbouring e. faecalis and in the two infants colonized by e. durans group.

both prematurity and low birth weight were statistically associated with enterococcal colonization on the first day of life  <cit> . influence of the diet was also reported with significantly higher enterococcal counts for formula-fed infants compared to breast milk-fed infants  <cit> . although enterococci were responsible for life-threatening infections, enterococcal colonization on the first day of life was not associated with differences in the outcome of infants with respect to death and life-threatening diseases  <cit> .

the genus veillonella
the genus veillonella was the only representative of the class negativicutes detected in this study. five percent of the ttge bands were affiliated to the genus veillonella . eight out of the  <dig> patients  were colonized with veillonella at least once during the survey . about 5% of the neonates were colonized during the first week of life, this rate reaching about 20% from the 4th week of life. semi-quantitatively, high representation of veillonella was observed between the 5th and the 7th week of life . large inter-individual variation was noted since veillonella spp.-corresponding ttge bands accounted for less than 5% to more than 30% of the generated bands depending on the patient . we showed here that members of the genus veillonella could be present in gut microbiota of very premature infants, sometimes with high representation  and persistent after the first colonization  .

veillonella spp. is part of several normal human microbiota including the fecal microbiota of healthy adults  <cit>  and is predominant in the upper digestive tract  <cit> . variations in the count of veillonella spp. were previously noted depending on diet, pathology or antimicrobial treatment  <cit> . veillonella may play a role in gut microbiota development at an early age  <cit>  since they were shown to appear in neonate faeces on the first days of life  <cit> , with significantly higher count in bottle-fed than in breast-fed children  <cit> .

in oral flora, veillonella spp. are early colonizers  <cit>  establishing a nutrition chain with other bacteria  <cit>  and are statistically associated with periodontal health  <cit> . veillonella obtain energy from lactic acid produced by the streptococci as an end product of carbohydrate fermentation  <cit> . by analogy, one can expect that such a metabolic interaction between veillonella spp. and lactic acid producers, notably staphylococci and streptococci, the main representatives of the major class bacilli in this study, may occur in the digestive tract. the role and the impact of such a potential metabolic cooperation between early colonizers of the gut microbiota of premature infants are worth to be investigated.

enterobacteriaceae
the family enterobacteriaceae was represented by  <dig> % of the ttge bands observed in this study  and was demonstrated in  <dig> infants  during the study period. most colonized patients  harbored a unique enterobacterial otu while  <dig> otus were recovered during the follow-up of patient y. the representation of this family was lower than observed in culture-based studies  <cit>  as well as in previous molecular-based studies, 36% of the clones detected in the study of magne et al.,  <cit>  being affiliated to enterobacteriaceae. in our patient population, enterobacteria were found in about  <dig> to 10% of the neonates during the  <dig> first weeks of life, then the rate of colonization increased to reach 45% of the neonates at the 8th week . semi-quantitatively, we observed a rapid increase in the population after the 30th day of life, enterobacteria being the dominating bacteria of the microbiota from the 7th week of life . four slotus were retrieved, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter cloacae. e. coli was the main species represented, accounting for more than half of the slotus of the family enterobacteriaceae and was found in  <dig> preterm neonates. klebsiella spp. and enterobacter cloacae were found in  <dig> and  <dig> patients, respectively, and always showed a complex ttge profile composed of several bands probably corresponding to 16s rdna intragenomic variability as previously described  <cit> .

most of the ttge bands  corresponding to enterobacteriaceae were observed in samples obtained after the 25th day of life and it was only after the 30th day of life, when the population quantitatively increased, that we observed enterobacteriaceae in several successive samples. this suggests a durable implantation of enterobacteria after the first month of life of very premature neonates contrary to the early implantation described in healthy infant  <cit>  and in pre-term infant gut  <cit> .

minority populations
fourteen minor glotus, each representing less than  <dig> % of the total glotus , were detected in this study. generally, less than 10% of the patients were colonized with such minor groups whatever the week of sampling  and semi-quantitative analysis showed that these groups were present at low load in the microbiota . they included  <dig> slotus, some of them being found in only one sample . others were able to colonize durably the neonate gut and were detected in several chronological samples in one or more patient. this was the case for bifidobacterium breve , bifidobacterium longum , rothia mucilaginosa , streptococcus salivarius , and streptococcus thermophilus , which were previously described in neonate gut microbiota.

the genus streptococcus appeared as a major group in the study of magne et al.  <cit>  whereas in accordance with our results streptococci were seldom detected in other studies  <cit> . moreover, streptococcal otus were most often transient colonizers of the neonatal gut except for s. salivarius in patients x and y.

bifidobacteria were detected in  <dig> patients  and represented less than 1% of the ttge bands analysed in this study. the rarity of bifidobacteria in our population of very preterm infants confirmed previous results  <cit> . bifidobacteria were described as early and dominant colonizers of healthy full-term neonates specially breast-fed neonates  <cit> , but their colonization is delayed in pre-term infants  <cit> . in a recent study, probiotics, in the form of bifidobacterium and lactobacillus, fed enterally to very low birth weight preterm infants for 6 weeks were shown to reduce the incidence of death and necrotizing enterocolitis  <cit> . the low prevalence of bifidobacteria in very preterm neonate gut could be an additional argument for their use as probiotics. however, the patient za who developed a nec was one of the four patients colonized by bifidobacteria in this study. we did not detect lactobacilli in this study.

to our knowledge, burkholderiales , sneathia sanguinegens and rothia mucilaginosa were described here for the first time as colonizers of the neonate gut. of note, a. commune and a. citraphilum have been found in four samples from the patient za, who developed a nec. some patients displayed very atypical microbiota; for instance, the patient t showed a persistent gut colonization by streptococcus thermophilus and an unidentified burkholderiales beside staphylococci over a 15-day period. no clinical or epidemiological particularity was noted for this neonate. the patient g was colonized by staphylococci, snethia sanguinegens , and an unidentified taxon and died at day  <dig> of life due to a non-digestive cause .

CONCLUSIONS
today, pyrosequencing and other high-throughput sequencing methods allow the in-depth description of microbiota. however, high throughput metagenomics is until today limited to a relative low number of samples  <cit> , as examplified in recent matagenomic studies of the neonate gut microbiota. despite low resolution, fingerprinting-based methods remain complementary of sequencing-based approaches because they allowed the follow-up of the dominant gut microbiota in larger cohorts of patients.

we describe here bacterial colonization dynamics in consecutive stool samples of  <dig> very premature infants. gram-positive bacteria  represent the quantitatively dominant microbiota established in the neonate gut during the first month of life, staphylococci being the earliest colonizers found in a large majority of infants. gram-negative bacteria  established a delayed and inconstant colonization over the study period compared to gram-positive bacteria.

beside dominant microbiota, satellite taxa are numerous, generating a great interindividual variability in the composition and chronology of colonizing species, despite a monocentric recruitment, like in term neonates. according to the literature, this variability has to be related to multiple factors such as ga, mode of delivery, birth weight, per partum maternal antibiotherapy and early neonatal antibiotherapy. thus, defining the normal gut-associated microbiota in preterm infants remains a challenge but is a prerequisite not only for future therapy aiming to intestinal microbiota modification but also for future research on intestinal diseases of the neonate.
