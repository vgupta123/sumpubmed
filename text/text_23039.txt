BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a gram negative opportunistic pathogen. as a frequent colonizer of catheters and the most frequent fatal causative agent of ventilator-assisted pneumonia, it is one of the most common agents in health-care associated infection  <cit> . lung deterioration due to chronic infection by p. aeruginosa affects patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder and is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> . p. aeruginosa infection treatment is often difficult because of the organism's intrinsic and acquired antibiotic resistance. this is due to the presence of multidrug efflux pumps  <cit> , low outer membrane permeability  <cit> , hypermutability  <cit> , biofilm formation  <cit> , and β-lactamase expression  <cit> .

p. aeruginosa has two chromosomally encoded β-lactamases: the poxb oxacillinase and the ampc cephalosporinase  <cit> . much of what is known about ampc regulation is from studies in escherichia coli, citrobacter freundii and enterobacter cloacae. these studies have elegantly demonstrated that induction of ampc, the chromosomal β-lactamase, involves ampr, ampd, and ampg, encoding a lysr type transcriptional factor, an amidase, and a permease, respectively  <cit> .

expression of c. freundi ampr in e. coli revealed that during normal physiological growth, ampr, in the presence of udp-murnac-peptide, binds to the ampc promoter and inhibits expression  <cit> . in e. coli, the addition of β-lactam antibiotics causes an increase in the cytosolic  <dig> -anhydro-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-γ-d-glu-meso-diaminopimelic acid  concentration, and a decrease in the cytosolic udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-γ-d-glu-meso-dap-d-ala-d-ala   <cit> . it was postulated that ampr can either activate or repress transcription from the ampc promoter and that its activity is dependent upon the nature of the bound effector molecule. in vitro, in the presence of udp-murnac-pentapeptide, ampr represses transcription of ampc, whereas in the presence of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide, ampr activates ampc  <cit> . thus, it is postulated that binding of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide alters the conformation of ampr from the repressive to the activating mode, facilitating the expression of ampc  <cit> . high-levels of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide accumulate in the absence of ampd. ampd is an amidase that cleaves  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide  <cit> . induction of e. cloacae ampc was also shown to be ampg-dependent  <cit> . β-lactamase fusion analysis suggests that e. coli ampg contains  <dig> transmembrane segments and two large cytoplasmic loops  <cit> . e. coli ampg was shown to transport n-acetylglucosamine-anhydrous n-acetylmuramic acid  and glcnac-anhmurnac-tri, -tetra, and -pentapeptides  <cit> .

comprehensive and elegant studies using enterobacteriaceae established the paradigm of the β-lactamase induction mechanism. orthologs of ampr, ampd, and ampg are found in numerous gram-negative species  <cit> . whether similar mechanisms are employed in all these organisms has not been established. it is possible that the induction mechanism could differ. the β-lactamase induction mechanism of p. aeruginosa has not been well-defined; however, it is known that p. aeruginosa ampr regulates expression of ampc as in other organisms  <cit> . similar to other systems, ampr is located upstream of the ampc gene  <cit> . additionally, p. aeruginosa ampr controls transcription of the oxacillinase, poxb, and several genes involved in virulence  <cit> . loss of ampr in p. aeruginosa causes a significant elevation in β-lactamase activity and other virulence factors  <cit> . p. aeruginosa also differs from other previously studied systems in that its genome has two ampg orthologs, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  <cit> . the current study reveals that these two genes, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  are required for β-lactamase induction, hence they have been named ampp and ampg, respectively. consistent with their putative roles as permeases, fusion analysis suggests that ampg and ampp have  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane helices, respectively. expression of ampp is dependent upon ampr and is autoregulated. together, these data suggest the distinctiveness of p. aeruginosa β-lactamase induction, as it is the first system that potentially involves two permease paralogs, and contribute to the general understanding of the induction mechanism.

RESULTS
genome sequence analysis of the pa <dig> and pa <dig> operons
e. coli ampg has been shown to be a permease that transports glcnac-anhmurnac peptides from the periplasm to the cytoplasm  <cit> ; however, the ampg function in p. aeruginosa has not been described. blast analysis of the e. coli ampg sequence against the six-frame translation of the pao <dig> genome identified two open reading frames, pa <dig> and pa <dig>  with significant homology  <cit> . global alignment using the needleman-wusch algorithm  <cit>  demonstrated that pa <dig> is  <dig> % identical and  <dig> % similar, while pa <dig> is  <dig> % identical and  <dig> % similar to ampg . the pseudomonas genome database identifies pa <dig> as encoding a putative permease with an alternate name of ampg, while pa <dig> is identified as encoding a probable transporter  <cit> . thus, pa <dig> will be referred to as ampg and pa <dig> as ampp .

analysis of the sequences around ampg and ampp revealed that they were in close proximity to two respective upstream orfs. based upon sequence analysis, it is likely that ampg and ampp constitute two two-gene operons with their respective upstream orfs . pa <dig>  overlaps the first seven base pairs of ampp . ampo is a putative seven-transmembrane protein with a strong lipoprotein signal peptide that has a potential cleavage site between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the ampg gene is located  <dig> bp downstream from pa <dig> , which encodes a putative protein with a dna-protein cysteine methyltransferase domain . the function of this domain remains unknown. no lipoprotein signal was detected in ampf.

to determine if ampg and ampp constitute two-gene operons with their upstream orfs, rna isolated from pao <dig> was analyzed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  using primers flanking the intergenic   and the overlapping  region . the expected amplicon sizes are  <dig> and  <dig> bp for the ampf-g junction and ampo-p junction, respectively  <cit> . as expected, amplification was observed with genomic dna . in the rna analyses, pcr products were observed in reverse transcription pcr when the template was prepared in the presence of reverse transcriptase , but not in the control reaction when reverse transcriptase was omitted . this confirms that ampo and ampp constitute a two-gene operon and ampf and ampg constitute another. in addition, reverse transcriptase real time pcr data is in agreement with ampo and ampp belonging to the same operon and ampf and ampg comprising another operon .

topology analysis of ampg and ampp
the ampg and ampp genes encode predicted proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids, isoelectric points of  <dig>  and  <dig> , and calculated molecular weights of  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda, respectively. hydrophobicity plots predict that ampg has  <dig> or  <dig> predicted transmembrane  helices, depending upon the algorithm used and ampp has  <dig>  <cit> . to determine the membrane topology of ampg and ampp, phoa or lacz was cloned downstream of the ampg and ampp genes. the 3'-end of the ampg and ampp genes were progressively deleted using exonuclease iii. at various time-points, the truncated genes were ligated and assayed for phoa and lacz activities in e. coli. clones were also sequenced to determine the reporter and amp gene junctions.

ampg fusions at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  as well as full length were lacz-positive and phoa-negative, and fusions at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were phoa-positive and lacz-negative domains, suggesting that ampg has only  <dig> tm helices . ampp fusions at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> as well as full length were lacz-positive and phoa-negative, and fusions at amino acids  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were lacz-negative and phoa-positive, consistent with  <dig> tm domains .

β-lactamase activity in strains containing mutations in ampg and ampp
the failure to induce c. freundii ampc in the absence of e. coli ampg suggested that ampg is essential for the induction of chromosomal β-lactamases  <cit> . to ascertain the role of the permeases in p. aeruginosa, isogenic ampg and ampp insertional inactivation mutants were constructed in the prototypic p. aeruginosa strain pao <dig>  referred to as paoampg and paoampp, respectively. the β-lactamase activity in the two isogenic mutants, paoampg and paoampp, was compared to pao <dig>  in the absence of β-lactam antibiotics, all strains showed a basal level of β-lactamase activity . upon challenge with  <dig> μg/ml of benzyl-penicillin, this level was elevated 10-fold  in pao <dig> . however, the β-lactamase activities of paoampp and paoampg remained low in the presence of β-lactam antibiotic, indicating a loss of β-lactamase induction . the loss of inducibility in paoampg could be partially restored by expressing ampg in trans, whereas the β-lactamase inducibility of paoampp was completely recovered when ampp was supplied in trans . both paoampp and paoampg mutants had the other copy of the permease gene intact. these observations suggest that ampg and ampp are individually important members of the β-lactamase induction system. to confirm that ampg and ampp play independent roles, cross-complementation of paoampp with pampg, and paoampg with pampp was performed. similar to the mutants, the cross-complemented strains did not show inducible β-lactamase activity .

a cultures at od <dig> of  <dig> - <dig>  were divided in two. one set was induced with  <dig> μg/ml benzyl-penicillin for three hours before harvesting. assays were performed on sonicated lysate using nitrocefin as a chromogenic substrate. one milliunit of β-lactamase is defined as  <dig> nanomole of nitrocefin hydrolyzed per minute per microgram of protein. assays were performed in triplicate.

b induction was carried out using  <dig> μg/ml benzyl-penicillin

c p <  <dig>  compared to uninduced pao1

d p <  <dig>  compared to induced pao1

to further understand the role of ampg and ampp in β-lactamase induction, β-lactamase activity was assayed at different concentrations of benzyl-penicillin in pao <dig>  paoampg and paoampp . upon encounter with the inducer , there was approximately 38% induction . for strain pao <dig>  this increase in β-lactamase activity continued in a dose-dependent manner until the maximum level of β-lactamase activity was reached when  <dig> μg/ml of benzyl-penicillin was added . a higher concentration of inducer did not result in a concomitant increase in the expression of the β-lactamase .

in paoampg, the initial increase of β-lactamase activity was observed at  <dig> μg/ml, suggesting that this burst of β-lactamase production is ampg-independent . however, unlike pao <dig>  the induction level failed to increase after  <dig> μg/ml of benzyl-penicillin and even significantly decreased with addition of increased concentrations of benzyl-penicillin .

mutation of ampp also prevented maximum induction of β-lactamase, but the defect was not quite as severe as in paoampg. in paoampp, the pattern of β-lactamase induction was very similar to pao <dig> at concentrations of benzyl-penicillin up to  <dig> μg/ml . however, unlike pao <dig>  addition of benzyl-penicillin at concentrations greater than  <dig> μg/ml failed to further induce production of β-lactamases . thus, low induction is independent of ampg or ampp. the observation that paoampp exhibited higher levels of β-lactamase expression at higher concentrations of benzyl-penicillin may suggest that ampg plays a greater role at higher concentrations of β-lactam.

most of the β-lactamase activity of p. aeruginosa can be attributed to ampc, however, p. aeruginosa does contain another chromosomally encoded β-lactamase, poxb  <cit> . to further analyze if the loss of β-lactamase induction in the paoampg and paoampp strains was due to loss of ampc function, the ampc promoter  activity was measured in pao <dig>  paoampg, and paoampp. as expected, upon treatment with benzyl-penicillin, pampc-lacz activity increased approximately 15-fold . benzyl-penicillin dependent induction of pampc-lacz was lost in paoampg or paoampp .

to further characterize the role of ampg and ampp, the sensitivity of pao <dig>  paoampg, and paoampp to several β-lactams was determined . inactivation of ampg led to a significant decrease in resistance to amoxicillin  and imipenem . no difference was observed with ampicillin/sulbactam, cefaclor, cefepime, oxacillin, piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, or ticaricillin/clavulonic acid . inactivation of ampp in pao <dig> did not alter its resistance profile with these β-lactams .

ampr regulation of pampfg and pampop
in inducible amp systems, the expression of ampc is tightly regulated by the transcription factor, ampr  <cit> . in order to investigate the role, if any, of ampr in the regulation of p. aeruginosa ampg and ampp, pampfg-lacz and pampop-lacz promoter fusions were generated and integrated into the chromosome of pao <dig> and paoampr via attb-attp site-specific recombination. these constructs are likely to mimic the chromosomal regulation of the ampfg and ampop operons. in the absence of inducer in pao <dig> and paoampr, there was a detectable basal level of promoter activity . the expression of the pampop-lacz promoter fusion was significantly increased in the presence of inducer in the wild-type pao <dig>  and this induction was lost completely in paoampr . however, the activity of the pampfg-lacz promoter fusion was comparable to the basal level in the absence and presence of inducer in pao <dig> and paoampr.

autoregulation of the ampg and ampp genes
to determine if ampg or ampp affected their own or each other's expression, pampfg-lacz and pampop-lacz promoter fusions were introduced into the chromosomes of paoampp and paoampg. interestingly, the activity of the pampop-lacz promoter fusion was significantly de-repressed in paoampp in the absence and presence of inducer . the activity of the pampfg-lacz was unchanged in paoampg in either the absence or presence of benzyl-penicillin. interestingly, pampfg-lacz activity was significantly increased in the presence, but not absence of β-lactam in the paoampp mutant, suggesting β-lactam-dependent repression of pampg by ampp. no change of the promoter activity of the ampop operon was observed in the paoampg mutant.

discussion
members of the pseudomonadaceae family are intrinsically resistant to β-lactam antibiotics. earlier reports successfully identified ampc, ampr, ampd, and ampe as genes involved in the β-lactamase induction mechanism. however, the question of how chromosomal β-lactamase is induced remains elusive. this study examines the role of two previously uncharacterized p. aeruginosa putative permeases.

p. aeruginosa harbors two distinct and independent ampg orthologues
in enterobacteriaceae, besides ampr, ampd and ampe, ampg has also been implicated in the ampc-encoded β-lactamase induction, acting as a membrane permease that transports  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide and  <dig> -anhmurnac-pentapeptide  <cit> . in p. aeruginosa, two paralogs, pa4393/ampg and pa4218/ampp, were found   <cit> . both ampg and ampp appear to be one member of two independent two-gene operons . pfam analysis of ampp identifies a major facilitator superfamily  domain between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  in agreement with a role in transport  <cit> . upstream from ampp is pa4219/ampo, a gene that has seven putative transmembrane domains  <cit> . together, these genes form an operon  that is conserved in p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  les, pacs <dig>  and pa <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, pfam analysis of ampg does not reveal any significant hits, however, there was an insignificant match to the mfs <dig> domain   <cit> . the ampg gene is downstream from pa4392/ampf, which encodes a protein with a putative 6-o-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase domain  <cit> . these two genes also form an operon  that is conserved in p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  les, and pa <dig>  <cit> .

the topology of the e. coli ampg permease has been analyzed using β-lactamase fusion proteins  <cit> . it was shown that ampg has ten transmembrane domains with the amino- and carboxyl-termini localized to the cytoplasm  <cit> . in accordance with roles as transporters, ampg and ampp have  <dig> or  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively predicted tm domains. phoa and lacz fusion analysis corroborates the existence of  <dig> and  <dig> tm domains in ampg and ampp, respectively . in ampg, the predicted transmembrane helices between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> and either  <dig> and  <dig> or  <dig> to  <dig> of pa <dig> are likely false positives. ampg fusions at amino acids  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicate that these amino acids are cytoplasmic , suggesting that if the region between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> is membrane associated, it may be an integral monotopic domain. similarly, ampg fusions at residues  <dig> and  <dig> are cytoplasmic, while that at  <dig> is periplasmic, suggesting that if the region between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig> is membrane associated, it may be an integral monotopic domain. the fusion data indicates that the carboxyl-termini of both ampg and ampp are cytoplasmic . bioinformatic analysis predicts that the amino termini of both proteins are also cytoplasmic. thus, like e. coli ampg, both the amino and carboxyl termini would be cytoplasmic  <cit>  .

consistent with a role in transport, ampp has an mfs domain  <cit> . the major facilitator superfamily domain is present in approximately one-fourth of all known prokaryotic transport proteins  <cit> . interestingly, most mfs proteins have  <dig> tm domains, while ampp, like e. coli ampg, has only  <dig>  <cit> . the topology analysis suggests pao <dig> ampg has  <dig> tm domains. pao <dig> ampg also has an insignificant mfs <dig> domain. a few mfs proteins have also been shown to have  <dig> tm domains  <cit> .

the ampg and ampp genes are essential for maximum β-lactamase induction
because of the similarity between ampg from enterobacteriaceae and pao <dig> ampg and ampp, β-lactamase levels of single ampg and ampp mutant isogenic strains were determined. although an increase in β-lactamase activity was observed, neither the ampg nor ampp mutant strain produced the same level of β-lactamase in the presence of benzyl-penicillin as pao <dig> . moreover, inactivation of ampg or ampp abolishes induction of pampc. this indicates that both ampg and ampp are essential for chromosomal β-lactamase induction. these genes did not cross-complement or exhibit gene dosage effects indicating that they play different roles in the induction pathway . these results are consistent with recent data demonstrating that mutation of ampg affects induction of β-lactamase and failure of ampp to complement an ampg mutation  <cit> . furthermore, the analysis using increasing benzyl-penicillin concentrations, shows that ampp plays an important role at lower inducer concentrations, whereas ampg is crucial at higher concentrations . mutation of ampg affects pao <dig> β-lactam resistance   <cit> . recent studies by zhang et al., in which deletion of ampg results in increased sensitivity to ampicillin  <cit> , are consistent with results presented here . in addition, ampg inactivation increases imipenem sensitivity . loss of ampp  function did not affect β-lactam sensitivity in either study   <cit> . ampp  has previously been named fptx due to its homology to rhtx in sinorhizobium meliloti  <dig>  <cit> . pa <dig> does not have a s. meliloti orthologue  <cit> . mutation of ampp in a p. aeruginosa cdc <dig> derivative that produces pyochelin but not pyoverdine, resulted in loss of pyochelin utilization  <cit> . in agreement with a role in pyochelin utilization, ampp is located next to genes involved in pyochelin biosynthesis and transport  <cit> . thus, the results presented in table  <dig> and figures  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrate that ampp is involved in β-lactamase induction in addition to its previously characterized role in pyochelin utilization  <cit> .

expression of ampp is induced by β-lactam addition in the presence of ampr
despite the importance of ampg in β-lactamase induction, little is known about its regulation. e. coli ampg is also the second gene in a two gene operon. upstream and divergently transcribed from the e. coli ampg operon, is the bola transcriptional regulator  <cit> . expression of bola is dependent upon rpos. previous studies suggest the expression of the e. coli ampg gene is independent of bola, rpos or ampd  <cit> . neither the p. aeruginosa ampg nor ampp gene is located near the bola locus  <cit> , thus pampfg and pampop -lacz transcriptional fusions were integrated into the chromosome of isogenic pao <dig> strains to begin to understand ampg and ampp regulation.

in light of the requirement of ampg and ampp for maximum p. aeruginosa β-lactamase induction, it was of interest to determine if expression of either was affected by β-lactam addition . in the absence of antibiotic, pampfg and pampop were constitutively expressed. expression of pampop significantly increased in the presence of inducer, while pampfg did not .

the lysr type transcriptional regulator ampr induces the expression of the ampc β-lactamase in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics  <cit> . ampr also affects the regulation of additional genes involved in p. aeruginosa antibiotic resistance and virulence  <cit> . insertional inactivation of ampr, did not affect pampfg - lacz activity, however, the increase in pampop-lacz activity previously observed upon β-lactam addition was lost in the absence of ampr . this indicates that ampp expression is regulated by ampr. future analyses will determine if this regulation is direct or indirect.

ampp affects regulation of both its own promoter and that of ampg
given that both ampg and ampp are required for maximum β-lactamase expression, both contain structural elements consistent with roles in transport, and the regulation of ampp expression by β-lactam and ampr, it was feasible that ampp could contribute to its own expression, perhaps by transporting potential effector molecules for ampr. indeed, ampp does appear to inhibit its own expression, as pampop activity increased ten-fold in paoampp in the absence, and approximately seven-fold in the presence of β-lactam . insertional inactivation of ampp also resulted in increased expression of pampfg in the presence of β-lactam .

proposed model for regulation of β-lactamase induction
the results presented contribute to what is known concerning β-lactamase induction in p. aeruginosa. it is well established that induction of the expression of the ampc β-lactamase is dependent upon ampr. although the exact mechanism has not been well characterized in p. aeruginosa, it is believed that the induction is triggered by conversion of ampr from a repressor to an activator . evidence from enterobacteriaceae suggest that this is a result of inhibition of the cell wall remodeling process by β-lactam antibiotics and subsequent accumulation of intermediates which in turn serve as effector molecules for ampr. consistent with previous findings suggesting that ampr acts as a positive regulator of amp genes  <cit> , activation of ampp expression required the presence of ampr and β-lactam antibiotic . based upon glycopeptide accumulation studies in other organisms, these findings suggest that the accumulation of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide and  <dig> -anhmurnac-pentapeptide in the presence of β-lactam antibiotics activates ampr that in turn up-regulates the expression of ampp. however, p. aeruginosa appears to use two non-redundant permeases in β-lactamase induction, suggesting, one may be involved in the import of muramyl peptides and the other in an as yet unknown function. the second permease may be involved in export of muramyl peptides or import of different muramyl peptides. further studies to determine the identity of these peptides and how they regulate ampr will be a critical next step in deciphering β-lactam resistance in p. aeruginosa.

the ampp gene is also auto-regulated via an unknown mechanism. if ampp performs a similar function as e. coli ampg, the absence of ampp would result in the accumulation of the periplasmic pool of glcnac-anhmurnac peptides or the reduction in the cytoplasmic pool of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide and  <dig> -anhmurnac-pentapeptide alerting the cell that the peptidoglycan recycling process is inhibited. this signalling could result in a positive feedback mechanism that up-regulates the expression of ampp. the accumulation of the periplasmic pool of  <dig> -anhmurnac-tripeptide and  <dig> -anhmurnac-pentapeptide in paoampp is also likely to up-regulate the expression of p. aeruginosa pao <dig> ampg in the presence of β-lactam.

currently, it is not known if pao <dig> ampg and ampp function similarly to e. coli ampg, however, like ampg, the pao <dig> ampg and ampp are important for β-lactamase induction  <cit>  . moreover, ampg and ampp are not functionally redundant as both are required for maximum induction. their expression is also differentially regulated. an ampp promoter-lacz fusion exhibited increased activity in the presence of ampr and β-lactam or the absence of ampp. an ampg promoter-lacz fusion was unaffected by the absence or presence of ampr or ampg. increased β-galactosidase activity was observed from the ampg promoter fusion in the presence of β-lactam in an ampp mutant . it is not known if this is dependent upon ampr, related to an ampr-independent function of ampp in β-lactamase induction or the function of ampp in pyochelin utilization.

CONCLUSIONS
p. aeruginosa appears to have two ampg paralogs, ampg and ampp, which encode proteins with  <dig> and  <dig> transmembrane domains. both are required for maximum induction of chromosomal β-lactamase and induction of the ampc promoter. expression of ampp did not restore maximum β-lactamase induced activity in an ampg mutation nor did expression of ampg complement an ampp mutation, indicating that ampg and ampp have distinct functions in β-lactamase regulation. in addition to being autoregulated, ampp is regulated by ampr and β-lactam. ampp is also involved in the regulation of ampg in the presence of β-lactam. in summary, the presence of two distinct permeases required for β-lactamase induction suggests that the p. aeruginosa β-lactamase resistance mechanism is more complex and distinct from the current paradigm.
