BACKGROUND
variability: a marker of neuro-behavioral functioning
when a person is performing a motor task, behavioral output is characterized by fluctuations over time. behavioral variability is also a generic manifestation of aging in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system . indeed, it has been repeatedly observed that aging leads to a significant increase in intra-individual variability of cognitive and motor outputs  <cit> . according to information theory and the neural noise hypothesis, such increase in variability might lead to lower information processing efficiency  <cit> , that is currently measured by the signal-to-noise ratio .

however, the increase in the magnitude of behavioral variability is not the only consequence of aging. indeed, its dynamic structure, i.e., deterministic rules and correlated fluctuations, can be also affected. specifically, it is widely recognized that the loss of complexity of behavioral output fluctuations – i.e., change in time-structure of variability toward either an increase or a decrease in the regularity measured by entropy metrics   <cit>  – is a functional indicator of organismic functions in health and disease. it may as well contribute to the better understanding of age-related reorganization of physiological and motor control systems  <cit> .

the distinction between the amplitude and the structure of variability is based on the assumptions that:  random/uncorrelated variability extracted from the signal’s variance is a proxy of the amount of white gaussian  noise in the system and an index of its efficiency through the measure of signal-to-noise ratio ; and  the structure of variability, which is reflected in the signal’s complexity, is a proxy of the underlying organization of the multiple components or processes involved at different temporal and spatial scales in task performance  <cit> . presumably, the magnitude of variability and its time-correlation structure stem from different origins and, accordingly, have specific functional significance. however, the question arises as to how the amplitude of variability  and its time-structure evolve in principled ways as a function of task constraints  and during aging. one of the objectives of the present study was to address this issue in an isometric force control task.

isometric force production: a prominent paradigm in motor control
isometric force control is one of the most prominent paradigms that are currently used in motor control and aging research to explore the different mechanisms underlying perceptuo-motor variability  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that force output fluctuations around a target value are sensitive to task demands, e.g., the required force level. further, variability of the force output also changes with age  <cit> . this latter effect is often attributed to age-related changes in motor unit recruitment and/or firing rate to maintain a given level of force output  <cit> . however, age-related changes in force control are not limited to the product of intra-muscular alterations. they are actually also driven by task-specific control and coordination constraints  <cit> . indeed, as in many functional tasks, accurate control of magnitude, direction, and timing of force results from a coalition of multiple constraints of various origins  and, in particular, from central integration of different sensory feedback loops with specific time delays  <cit> . the involvement of different control processes in task-goal achievement can be assessed through the relative amount of power expressed in specific frequency ranges . from this perspective, low frequency bands  are associated with sensorimotor processing  <cit> , whereas higher frequency bands  are considered to reflect the neural components of physiological tremor  <cit> . it has been suggested that with increasing difficulty of the task, the relative contribution of low frequency displays an inverted-u shape evolution with a minimum around 40% of mvc  <cit> . compared to young adults, elderly were found to present greater relative power in the 0–4 hz bandwidth  <cit> , which was presumably associated with deficits in visuo-motor processing capacities .

overall, changes in magnitude, structure, and frequency content of force fluctuations convey valuable information about underlying modifications and reorganizations between the aforementioned control mechanisms as a function of force levels and age. in the present study, we hypothesized that these changes should occur concomitantly in principled ways, as a signature of  dynamics between functional mechanisms underlying force- and age-related changes in efficiency and complexity of the neuro-behavioral system  <cit> .

variability, information transmission, and complexity in isometric force control
in commonly used force control tasks where subjects are requested to either maintain or modulate their forces as instructed by a visually presented target line , the magnitude of behavioral fluctuations is measured in either absolute terms  or in relative terms . it has been shown that in young adults, sd increases non-linearly with increasing force level  <cit> , whereas the cv is highest for low force levels  <cit> . older adults are generally found to exhibit larger variability than young adults when expressed in relative terms  <cit> . the results for variability expressed in absolute terms are less consistent and vary between studies, from a significant  <cit>  to a nearly significant  age effect or even no difference . it is noticeable, however, that the effect of age on these two metrics has not been systematically investigated across the range of possible  force levels. available findings regarding changes in the time-structure of force production with advancing age indicate that, at least for low force levels, the variability of force maintenance gets more regular, and thus less complex   <cit> .

slifkin and newell  <cit>  addressed the issue of the co-variation between signal-to-noise ratio  and entropy measure during isometric force control in young adults. they assumed that maintaining a given level of isometric force results from interactions between multiple component processes   <cit> . according to this assumption they hypothesized that optimal complexity of the system’s organization and information processing efficiency should be functionally related. the different experiments carried out in both studies comprised force levels between  <dig> and 95% of the individuals’ mvc. although a smooth pattern could be less consistently drawn from the second study, authors concluded that:  signal-to-noise ratio  and complexity measure  followed a similar nonlinear trend  and  the optima of the two curves roughly corresponded to the same range of force level . these findings are compatible with the hypothesis that complexity of behavioral outputs is related to variability and information processing in the system  <cit> . in other words, the optimal organization of the nmss, which is reflected in entropy metrics, presumably improves the efficient transfer and circulation of information necessary to produce and control force over time  <cit> . such integrated view, which constitutes a theoretical alternative to the classic approach to neuro-muscular control, has not been completely elucidated and suffers from some limitations that preclude its extension to aging without further empirical investigation. to our knowledge, no other published work attempted to reproduce slifkin and newell’s  <cit>  results.

variability of force output and the system’s efficiency: limitations and challenges
beyond the above-mentioned inconsistencies in slifkin and newell’s study , some other limitations deserve to be pointed out and addressed before  confirming the link between information processing in the system and the expressed complexity in behavioral outputs, and  understanding how this link is affected by task and age factors. a major point is the single scale metric of entropy that was used  to infer complexity of force fluctuations. indeed, apen is known to be highly sensitive to data length and to produce less consistent and reliable results than its subsequent version, i.e., sample entropy . additionally, both single scale measures do not make the distinction between a completely random signal and a complex one that contains long-range correlations. for instance, white noise  always yields higher entropy values than pink noise . to overcome this limitation and to offer a better differentiation between random and complex processes, costa et al.  <cit>  introduced multi-scale entropy  and showed that this measure is more reliable than the single scale estimators to characterize physiologic and sensorimotor complexity by taking long-term correlations into account .

through the use of mse, the different time-scales can be, to some extent, linked to different processes operating at certain bandwidths. this has been recently exploited in brain studies  but, to our knowledge, never in behavioral studies and, especially not, in force control experiments. the underlying reasoning is that the coarse graining procedure acts in similar fashion as a low-pass filter, which would result in eliminating progressively the processes operating at the fastest scales. thus, mse offers a valuable addition to the spectral slope  analysis that is more conventionally used to hint at changes in auto-correlations characterizing the signal, and thereby revealing information about underlying control processes . for instance, sosnoff and newell  <cit>  proposed that with age a more broadband profile of the frequency structure should be related to less structure in the variability, and could be hence indicative of a change in the number of active degrees of freedom. using mse, this should be reflected in time-scale dependent changes, thereby indexing the specific contribution of the different processes to the observed changes in complexity with increasing age.

aims and hypotheses of the study
in the present study, we aimed to attain a better understanding of what distinguishes between different conditions of functioning of the same system  and different functional systems  during isometric force production. to achieve this objective, we analyzed complementary variables that characterize the changes in the amplitude and the structure of the variability of the force output. we hypothesized that a more global picture of task- and age-related differences could be afforded by linking them with mechanisms known to operate on specific time-scales and frequency bands. accordingly, the comparisons with previous studies that used single scale entropy measures and/or different acquisition frequencies and filtering were made more straightforward by converting scale factor  to time-scales .

for absolute variability as well as for frequency-based measures, we expected a non-linear increase with increasing force level. for the efficiency, we expected to observe an inverted-u shape function with a maximum around 35–40% of the mvc. in line with findings by slifkin and newell  <cit> , we expected that global complexity measures of force fluctuations would match the efficiency functions, with roughly aligned optima at intermediate force levels. it was hypothesized that this matching would be more pronounced for the time-scales containing mostly information about lower frequencies that are relevant to sensorimotor processing . indeed, focusing on specific scales would inform about process-dependent changes in the signal’s complexity  and predictability .

with respect to aging effects, we expected older participants to be overall more variable, less efficient, and less complex in their force output. with regard to the age-by-force levels interaction, we tested two contrasting hypotheses:  the general organization and operating mechanisms would remain the same as the system ages but efficiency would be lower, inducing hence a downward shift in the values of the different measures regardless of the force level; or  the underlying organization and control would breakdown at specific levels of constraints .

methods
participants
eleven healthy older adults  and eleven healthy young adults  participated in this study. all participants took part voluntarily and provided their informed consent to the procedure of the study. they were not aware of the specific purpose of the study and it was stated that they could stop the experiment at any time they would wish to. participants self-declared that they were healthy, physically active, and autonomous in daily living activities. further, all participants reported to be right-hand dominant, to have normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and no trauma of upper limb or known disease that might affect the results of the experiment. the experimental protocol was approved by the local ethic committee of aix-marseille university and was in accordance with the ethical standards laid down in the declaration of helsinki.

experimental setup
participants sat at an experimental table with their forearms resting on the table , so that the right index finger was lying comfortably on the force transducer . to collect the force data and to provide visual feedback to the participants, a customized labview  program and a national instruments acquisition card  were used. the force data were sampled at 240 hz and saved for later analysis. in front of the participants, the target area and task-specific online feedback was presented on a 19” screen. the online feedback consisted of a bar indicating the level of the produced force in% mvc in reference to the target level . it was given at a sampling rate of 12 hz .figure  <dig> 
experimental setup. participants were seated in a comfortable position with both forearms resting on the tabletop so that the right index finger was easily placed on the force transducer. visual feedback of their performance was provided on a screen in front of them. the experiment included two steps with specific feedback displays: 1) the mvc estimation  and 2) the force maintenance task . for the mvc, the pressure of the finger that was applied to the force transducer raised up a blue column by  <dig>  cm per 1 n. for the maintenance task, two lateral red bars represented the target line  and a mobile blue bar restituted the applied force level.



each trial was initiated by the participants starting to press the force transducer. data collection began as soon as the average value of  <dig> sample points exceeded a threshold of 2 n. this was indicated to the participant by a bar next to the target area that was illuminated and remained illuminated until the trial was completed. the participants were instructed to release their force when the bar turned off. the start of each trial was self-paced, but a mandatory break of 3 s was implemented in the program. data were stored in absolute force values.

tasks and procedure
participants were informed verbally about the general procedure and were provided with written instructions explaining the task and their positioning during the trials. the experimental setup is summarized in figure  <dig>  firstly, mvc was measured by using data from three trials of 5 s each. this procedure is the standard procedure to determine mvc for isometric force production with the finger  <cit> . the participants were instructed to press as hard as they could on the force transducer to lift then hold the mobile bar on the screen as high as possible. a resting period of about 30 s was given between trials. the mean force obtained during the last three seconds of each trial was considered as the mvc and was used to calculate the relative target force levels of the consecutive task conditions. initial verification showed that the groups differed with regard to their mvc, f =  <dig> , p < . <dig>  ηp2 = . <dig> .

next, participants had a phase of familiarization with the experimental setup, during which they practiced all the force levels used in the following step. afterwards, participants performed the force maintenance task at various force levels. the target force levels were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 80% of each participant’s individual mvc. the target force level to be maintained was indicated on the screen with two red lines , between which a blue line could be moved up and down as function of the force applied on the force transducer. the participants were instructed to align the blue line with the red ones and to maintain it as stable as possible for 15 s. timing was indicated by the illumination of the green bar next to the display . each force level condition was performed twice consecutively. the order of force levels was randomized. verification, preliminary to data analysis, confirmed that all participants respected task instructions and that there were no significant differences between groups in terms of relative mean force production .figure  <dig>

data analysis
the acquired data of the produced force over time were analyzed with the use of a matlab r2012b customized program . the data were low-pass filtered with a 4th order butterworth filter at 30 hz. to exclude the ramp phase from further analysis, the first  <dig>  s were discarded. all the following analyses were accordingly conducted on  <dig>  s trials. data were converted to relative force values in percentage of the participants’ individual mvc. all variables were calculated per trial and then averaged over the two trials. the mean of the produced force, the standard deviation, and the cv were calculated to characterize general properties of force production cv = sd/mean force. as an index of efficiency, the signal-to-noise ratio was computed as: signal-to-noise ratio = mean force/sd. the variability structure of force time series was characterized using mse as introduced by costa and colleagues  <cit> . this method consists of calculating sampen  <cit>  over multiple time-scales contained in the analyzed time series, and thus in the expressed dynamics  <cit> . sampen measures the degree of irregularity in the fluctuations of a time series by calculating conditional probabilities, which represent the likelihood that a vector of m data points matches a template with the same number of data points within a tolerance range of r normalized to the sd of the signal  <cit> . we set r to  <dig>  and m to  <dig>  the time-scales were constructed by coarse graining the original time series using a moving average with non-overlapping windows of the size  of the scale factor . then sampen was calculated for each of the coarse grained time series. based on our signals’ length and sampling rate, sample entropy was calculated for  <dig> scales. the mse curves were obtained by plotting sampen values as a function of the scale factor. to capture their general characteristics, based on zhang’s definition of complexity as the integral of all scale-dependent entropies  <cit> , the area underneath the curves was calculated . then, focus was brought on the area of the time-scales range representing sensorimotor processing . additionally, specific scales were examined to explore whether task and age effects on behavioral regularity show clear scale dependence that would be mediated by the control mechanisms at stake. namely, three functionally relevant scales were selected: scale  <dig> , representative of the signals’ frequency range after filtering ; scale  <dig> , more representative of the mechanisms known to operate in force control, that is, sensorimotor processing and physiological tremor ; scale  <dig> , the most representative of sensorimotor processing .

the structure of the force output in the frequency domain was characterized by spectral analysis. the power spectrum was calculated by use of the pwelch function implemented in matlab by means of a hanning window with  <dig> data points with a non-overlapping window of  <dig> data points. to characterize the overall changes in the distribution of power, the slope of the log-log plot was determined per participant for each condition. it quantifies how broadband the power spectrum is, with a  <dig> slope being that of white gaussian noise. peak power was determined in the frequency band from 0–4 hz and in the frequency band from 7–14 hz. the window to detect peak power of the tremor component was defined after visual inspection to account for inter-individual differences in peak frequency. additionally, proportional power spectra were calculated and the same detection of peak power within the aforementioned frequency bands was performed.

moreover, signal-to-noise ratio and mse areas as well as mse values per representative scales were plotted over the force levels and polynomial fittings were performed to capture characteristics of task-related changes per group. for the mse values per scale the fitting was used for visualization, for the signal-to-noise ratio and the mse area the peak values per group were detected and interpreted.

statistics
statistical analyses were conducted in statistica . all dependent variables  were analyzed with an age  × force level  anova with repeated measures on the latter factor. in order to analyze the mse for the specific scales, an age  × force level  × scale  anova with repeated measures on both latter factors was calculated. the sphericity of the data was verified with the test of mauchley. the greenhouse-geisser correction was applied when the epsilon value was smaller than  <dig>  <cit> . non-adjusted degrees of freedom are reported. the level of significance was set to p <  <dig> . when significant, effect sizes are given as partial eta squares . significant main effects and interaction effects were followed by newman-keuls’ post-hoc test.

discussion
in the present study, we investigated the sensorimotor processes underlying isometric force control through measures of the magnitude and the time-frequency structures of behavioral variability.

as a preliminary observation, our participants groups presented significant differences in mvc, with older participants’ values being lower than those of younger ones. this result was expected and can be considered as a typical marker of age-related dynapenia  <cit> . it is noticeable however that the observed group difference in mvc is considerably larger than what is usually reported in the literature , which insured that we tested here significantly different force control systems. however, the use of relative force levels, which is a procedure commonly used in the literature to normalize for inter-individual strength disparity  <cit> , also insured that force conditions were comparable between participants. in this respect, we found that participants of both groups were equally capable of correctly scaling their produced force and performing the task according to the instructions.

variability and efficiency differ between force levels in young and older adults
absolute variability of force outputs  non-linearly increased with force level in both groups. relative variability  was higher at the lowest force level  than for all the other levels and older adults were more variable than young participants. these results are consistent with previous studies reporting that cv is an age-sensitive measure  <cit>  and that the age effect is more pronounced for relative than for absolute variability  <cit> . they are also consistent with christou’s  <cit>  assumption that age effects on force output variability are more consistently observed for lower than for higher force levels. overall, age-related changes in variability can also be related to those reported using other tasks. indeed, the observed increase in relative variability of force output with age  is consistent with the general observation that older adults are more variable than young adults in a wide range of cognitive  and motor tasks, e.g., repetitive reaching  <cit>  or gait  <cit> .

the efficiency of information processing of the force control system was estimated through the use of the signal-to-noise ratio , which showed an inverted-u shape in both groups, with a peak value around 35% of the mvc in young adults, and around 40% in older adults. this result is consistent with the findings reported by slifkin and newell  <cit>  in young adults. it shows additionally that, while conserving a general inverted-u shape in both groups, aging does not dramatically affect the range of optimal functioning relative to the maximum force level. results also showed a lower signal-to-noise ratio in older adults, which supports the hypothesis that aging leads to a decrease in information processing efficiency in the central nervous system. this has been already observed in both the sensorimotor  and the cognitive domains . nonetheless, the difference between young and older adults was significant at low and medium force levels, with the largest difference at the level corresponding to optimal signal-to-noise ratio  and no difference was found for the higher force levels. although the maximization of age differences for intermediate relative force levels is currently admitted for force control , such pattern differs from that observed with different paradigms, as for instance in fitts’ task  <cit>  and, more generally, from the age-by-complexity effect  <cit> , which has been reported in aging literature. indeed, the relation between task difficulty and performance is, in general, described as being linear and age-related differences as being more pronounced with increasing task difficulty. presumably, the present different pattern of age-by-complexity effect reflects the specificities of the task . indeed, in isometric force control tasks, the difficulty does not seem to increase linearly with force level, as attested by the inverted-u shape of the signal-to-noise ratio in both groups. however, the shapes of the efficiency functions are slightly different between the two groups, i.e., more marked in young participants, thereby leading to a specific pattern of age differences. the observed age-related differences presumably also depend on whether absolute or relative variability is measured. as an illustration, we did an exploratory analysis by studying the force levels for which younger and older participants had on average comparable absolute force levels. by doing so, group differences in variability  were reversed such as higher differences were observed for the higher force levels. similarly, older participants were found to have lower signal-to-noise ratios at higher force levels , but were equivalent at the low force level .

the frequency structure of the force output fluctuations was captured by the power distributions of frequency spectra and by the spectral slopes. with respect to the power spectra analysis, results showed that the power distribution changed comparably in both groups as a function of force level. specifically, the spectral power distribution showed two peaks that were located in the frequency ranges presumably representing sensorimotor processing and tremor, respectively. this distribution structure is consistent with the findings previously reported by taylor et al.  <cit> , whereas it remained unobservable in other studies that focused on the frequency range representing sensorimotor processing  <cit> .

overall, for both frequency bands absolute peak power increased with force levels. this effect was previously reported for the frequencies reflecting sensorimotor processing . proportional power analysis showed that, compared to absolute power, the effect of force level was diminished in the frequency range reflecting sensorimotor processing, and reversed for the tremor component . these results suggest that force levels change the relative contribution of the sensorimotor processing and the tremor components to the produced behavior, which is reflected in different frequency structures of force fluctuations. such changes are accompanied by changes toward steeper spectral slopes with increasing force level. this indicates that the frequency content of force output is not randomly distributed, but rather dominated by structured fluctuations. the contribution of lower frequencies increases as the relative force requirements increase.

it is striking that similar frequency profiles and spectral slopes were observed for both age groups. these results differ from those observed in previous, but not strictly comparable, studies where higher absolute power values were reported for older than for younger participants, for both frequency ranges, i.e., 0–4 hz  <cit>  and 8–12 hz  <cit> , respectively. with regard to proportional power analysis, current literature is not unanimous when it comes to age effects. for instance, looking at age-related differences in low relative force production , sosnoff and voudri  <cit>  found higher proportional power for older participants than for younger ones, but not for the frequencies representing sensorimotor processing. conversely, heffernan et al.  <cit> , who used the 30% mvc force condition, for which the highest group difference was expected, did not report a significant age effect on any of the examined frequency ranges . other studies also did not report age-related differences for the frequency range related to physiological tremor  <cit> . in this respect, morrison and newell  <cit>  proposed two possible explanations:  the increase of tremor might be only detectable for participants older than 80 years; and  the task conditions under which the tremor is assessed might be decisive, with more challenging situations  being more affected by age . however, as we didn’t study tremor explicitly , we refrain from drawing extensive and speculative interpretations. at least, it might be that, for both the sensorimotor and tremor components, discrepancies between the present results and those reported in previous studies result from group differences in absolute force levels.

in addition to the analysis of frequency structure of fluctuations, we also investigated variability structure in the time domain.

complexity and time-scale dependent structure of force output change across force levels in young and older adults
the changes in the time structure of force output fluctuations were captured by the mse analysis. to our knowledge, no previous study has investigated age-related differences of mse of force output fluctuations across a wide range of relative force levels. this metric is considered as a more reliable estimator of the system’s complexity than single scale measure of entropy, e.g., apen and sampen. indeed, restricting the analysis to the original time-scale of the acquired time-series conveys simply information about its regularity, which could change depending on the used sampling frequency and filtering . thus, plotting mse curves provided information about the richness of the signal across the different scales, as a function of increasing force levels and age.

results showed that, across groups and force conditions, the overall shape of mse curves was prominently characterized by an eventual stabilization, or a slight increase, of sampen values over longer time-scales. the observed mse profiles clearly differ from those corresponding to random signals, e.g., white noise, for which entropy values dramatically decrease beyond the first scales . instead, they indicate the presence of long-range correlations that are not dominated by a single time constant. the presence of these non-random fluctuations of force outputs reflects the inherent complexity of the force control system, which implicates the interaction of somatosensory and visual feedback networks, numerous brain regions, and muscular processes operating over multiple time scales. in addition, these long-range correlations constitute non-invasive markers to elucidate multi-scale contribution of specific task- or system-related constraints.

for both age groups, the increase in force level resulted in an increase in sampen values for most of the higher scales, thereby suggesting an increase in long-term correlations. for each force level, a visual inspection of group mean curves suggested lower complexity in the elderly for the low and intermediate force levels , as shown by the lower entropy at most longer scales . the whole area underneath the mse curve plotted as a function of force reveals an inverted-u shape for both groups. this pattern indicates an optimal complexity around 60% of mvc, which is a higher percentage than those corresponding to the optimum of the signal-to-noise ratio in young and older participants groups. the area underneath the scales representing the sensorimotor processing component  also displayed a similar pattern of results. it is noticeable, however, that, although the visual inspection of mse curves suggested a decrease in complexity with increasing age, this was not confirmed by the statistical analysis. this result does not allow us to draw conclusions consistent with the currently admitted loss of complexity hypothesis , which predicts a decrease in behavioral complexity with aging . the reasons that explain such lack of statistical evidence are not completely clear. however, it can be noticed that most of previous studies, including those on force control, inferring or predicting age-related changes in complexity in support of the loch have used single scale entropy measures .

though a single scale cannot be used to faithfully describe the overall dynamics, which emerges from interactions between processes operating at multiple time-scales, we contend that it could be of interest to assess specific control processes. this was supported by the three-way interaction of age, force level, and scale, which revealed a differentiated pattern of the signal’s regularity at time scales related to the different components of force output fluctuations. for instance, the analysis of scale  <dig> , which characterizes the overall dominant/meaningful fluctuations of the force output, revealed that behavioral regularity increased  with increasing force level. this result corroborates the findings of the spectral slope analysis, and supports the hypothesis that with increasing force level more long-term correlations are present. conversely, for scale  <dig>  including frequencies up to 12 hz  and around the crossing of mse curves of different force levels, no effect of task conditions was observed on sampen values. it can be concluded that, after high frequencies were averaged out from the signal , the structure of force fluctuations was found to be similar across all force levels. at scale  <dig> the sensorimotor processing component can be more specifically examined. here, as expected, results showed an inverted-u shape pattern that is comparable to the mse area and to the signal-to-noise ratio curves. although no clear pattern of age differences could be extracted, the observations related to the interaction of group factor with force level and time-scale suggest that, compared to young adults and depending on the control processes under scrutiny, elderly could show more or less structured behavior at different force levels.

overall, on the one hand, our results show that young and elderly participants adopt a qualitatively similar organization of the force control system that is reflected by the time-structure of fluctuations and the similar changes in response to task requirements. however, it is noticeable that these findings were highlighted by confronting young and elderly to comparable constraints that is, by controlling for the age-related deficit in strength through the use of relative force. on the other hand, group differences did not completely vanish, which suggests that age differences can be more or less maximized, depending on task settings. for instance, if task difficulty was scaled in absolute instead of relative values, or if different degrees of freedom or muscular synergies were used, age effects could be presumably larger . thus, the present observations suggest that, at least in isometric force control tasks, a coalition of multiple factors determines how the system organizes its degrees of freedom to accomplish the task, which is reflected in the amplitude and structure of variability of behavioural outputs. this perspective is consistent with morrison and newell’s  <cit>  assumption that the confluence of constraints including aging, instead of the aging process itself, determines the complexity of force outputs. further research is still needed to disentangle the contributing processes to force control and their interactions at various task settings and in different groups.

correspondence between efficiency, complexity, and frequency structure observed in young and older adults
the use of several measures provides multiple markers to characterize variability, complexity, and efficiency of the force control system and to capture information about the contribution of the underlying sensorimotor processes. therefore, considering these measures in conjunction, instead of separately, might afford a global picture of how the force control system is organized in principled ways under different task conditions and whether this organization changes during aging.

inspired by slifkin and newell’s  <cit>  study, we searched for the correspondence between the evolutions of signal-to-noise ratio and complexity measure , as well as entropy at specific scales, as function of force levels. this was theoretically grounded on the presumed functional relation between information processing efficiency and systemic organization  <cit> . we extended this reasoning to the force control system under the hypothesis that such a correspondence would indicate that an optimal information transmission between the different subsystems results from an optimal organization of the underlying physiological connectivity. however, in the present study, optima of the system’s efficiency , and its complexity were not aligned. in addition, since the proportional peak power showed no differentiated pattern between force levels, we could not confirm that the peak power mirrors the function of the information transmission measure. thus, our results were consistent with those previously reported by slifkin and newell  <cit>  with respect to the profiles of the efficiency and complexity patterns over the range of force levels, but not in terms of their correspondence. to avoid misleading conclusions, it is noteworthy to acknowledge that the present study is not directly comparable to those of slifkin and newell  <cit>  that use apen, which refers to regularity and is therefore considered as insufficient to assess the changes in complexity  <cit> . moreover, unlike mse, their single scale measure doesn’t offer the possibility of focusing on multiple specific and functionally-relevant time-scales. indeed, in the present study, the adopted multiscale approach revealed the presence of strong time-scale dependence in the observed changes in behavioral regularity. this finding implies different involvements of the control mechanisms in the structure of force fluctuations at the different force levels. in particular, it is noticeable that the inverted-u profiles of complexity curves were only observed, in both age groups, at scale  <dig>  which is the scale capturing closely the functioning of sensorimotor processes. the convergence between mse and power spectra shows how the increase in force level modifies the contribution of the two control processes. more specifically, it reflects the decrease in the relative implication of the tremor component with increasing force requirements. in the frequency domain, this was shown by the decrease of the proportional peak power of the 7–14 hz range, as well as by the steeper spectral slope with increasing force level. in the time domain, it can be seen by the change in the overall shape of the mse curves. in particular, the presence of a peak at short scales  <cit>  for the curves at the lowest two force levels indicates that some meaningful information is contained at higher frequencies . conversely, the flatter profiles observed for 40–80% conditions indicate that, under these task constraints, the signal’s entropy is rather uniformly and predominantly contained in lower frequencies, i.e., within the sensorimotor range, which underlies the prominence of long-range correlations in force fluctuations.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we used mse to assess changes in long-range correlations in force output fluctuations and to make the link with the findings observed with other conventional analyses . as currently argued within the framework of dynamical system analysis  <cit> , our results support the view that behavioral variability, in terms of both magnitude and structure, have a functional meaning and provide non-invasive markers of the adaptations of the whole force control system to various constraints. specifically, the time and frequency structures of force outputs can be used to assess the dominance of processes underlying force control. here, we found that, for both age groups task adaptation presented a strong dependence on time-scales, with force control being increasingly dominated by long-scales  dynamics as force requirements increased. although not statistically significant, a tendency for an age-related loss of complexity was observable for the easy and moderate force levels. the surprisingly weak age effects on variability and complexity measures suggests a similar organization of the system underlying force control for participants of both age groups, even though efficiency was lower in older as compared to younger participants. nevertheless, we argue that the use of relative scaling could have attenuated age effects. indeed, it could be that by normalizing for the most prominent age-related deficit, which in our task is force weakness, we masked age-related changes in the dynamics. for instance, to reveal how aging modifies the spontaneous dynamics in the widely used bimanual coordination paradigm, task constraints are commonly scaled in absolute terms .

overall, our findings suggest that the behavioral expression of the loch is not as straightforward as conventionally admitted . accordingly, a number of results reported in the literature should be interpreted with caution.
