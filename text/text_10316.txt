BACKGROUND
cleft palate  is the second most common birth defect  in humans, and is caused by the lack of fusion of the embryonic palatal shelves early in gestation 
 <cit> . the formation of a continuous palate is a complex process involving multiple steps, including: palatal shelf growth, elevation, attachment, and fusion. the stages of palatogenesis are regulated by numerous genes that are essential for normal palate development. our laboratory has a long-standing interest in identifying the genetic and molecular mechanisms that regulate palatogenesis in order to understand the factors involved in the development of orofacial clefts
 <cit> . it has been shown that both genetic and environmental elements contribute to the development of cleft palate
 <cit> . we previously presented that transforming growth factor -β isoforms play essential roles in the regulation of palatal morphogenesis, including the finding that tgfβ <dig> mediates palatal fusion both in primary cells and organ culture
 <cit> . according to several population-based mutation screening studies, tgfβ <dig> is considered a candidate gene for non-syndromic cp in humans
 <cit> . furthermore, tgfβ <dig> knockout mice are born with cp but lack other major defects
 <cit> .

in our earlier studies
 <cit> , we examined gene expression during palatal fusion in normal mice using microarray analysis and detected several genes essential for completion of palatal development. as genome sequencing technologies advanced, it has become feasible to systematically analyze global transcriptomal changes and identify the key molecular components in the developing palate during crucial stages of palatogenesis. failure to regulate functional or structural genes during these stages may result in cleft palate. next-generation sequencing  technologies, or rna-seq, have recently emerged as a revolutionary tool of transcriptomics
 <cit>  by revealing the complex landscape of the transcriptome with high-throughput at an incomparable level of sensitivity and accuracy
 <cit> . the results of rna-seq demonstrate high levels of reproducibility for both technical and biological replicates
 <cit> . the analysis of tgfβ <dig> knockout mice by rna-seq provides a valuable resource to facilitate our understanding of the complex genetic and molecular mechanisms of palatogenesis. this technology also allows us to detect allelic and splice variants of some of the genes involved in palate development in tgfβ <dig> knockout mice, which is currently beyond the scope of this article.

evidence suggests that tgfβ <dig> is essential to palato-genesis, especially during embryonic days  e <dig>  to e <dig> . however, the cellular mechanisms maintained and regulated by tgfβ <dig> signaling have not been extensively explored to enable an understanding of those genes functionally regulated by tgfβ <dig> during normal palatogenesis or those genes deregulated in tgfβ3-null mice. our objective in this study was to analyze transcriptome changes and their contribution to the development of cp among different gestational ages and tgfβ <dig> knockout alleles. in this study, we analyzed the transcriptome of tgfβ <dig> mice by rna-seq at crucial stages of palatogenesis, including: palatal convergence, adhesion, and fusion; and we characterized some crucial transcripts that may play key regulatory roles throughout palatal development. we used palatal shelves extracted from e <dig> , e <dig>  and e <dig>  allelic mice to analyze differential expression patterns of their transcriptome throughout the palatal developmental process. the overall transcriptome analysis of tgfβ <dig> wt mice revealed that almost  <dig> genes were upregulated during the transition from e <dig>  to e <dig>  and more than  <dig> were downregulated from e <dig>  to e <dig> , which suggests that regulation of these transcripts is essential during the stages of palate development. in order to streamline the analysis of the high number of transcripts, we downsized the list of genes to cp genes only. using biological databases, we categorized a comprehensive inventory of cp genes both in human and mouse genomes and focused on their differential expressions and biological interpretations. unexpectedly, the expression patterns of cp genes between tgfβ3+/− and tgfβ3−/− were not significantly different from each other, and the expression of the majority of cp genes remained unchanged from e <dig>  to e <dig> . using this data, we identified  <dig> unique genes , which may regulate cleft palate formation in tgfβ3−/− mice. we used ingenuity pathway analysis  software to analyze downstream effects of these genes on biological functions, molecular networks, and regulatory pathways- particularly tgfβ signaling. this is the first genome scale analysis of the palatal transcriptome of mice generated by rna-seq technology during critical stages of palatogenesis. this data will allow the comprehensive analysis of tgfβ signaling during palatogenesis and provide information on the chronological regulation of downstream tgfβ-activated transcription factors that function to induce cellular differentiation, transformation, and apoptosis.

RESULTS
analysis of rna-seq data
as outlined in the experimental workflow of our study , rna samples were extracted from mouse palatal tissues of tgfβ <dig> knockout mice , heterozygous , and wildtype ) at three developmental stages ; libraries were prepared, converted to cdna, and sequenced by using the illumina hiseq <dig> next generation sequencer. the bioinformatics analysis of rna-seq data was processed using the tuxedo protocol
 <cit> , which includes tophat, cufflinks and cummerbund packages from r. the cp genes were identified from omim and mgi databases and downstream effects were analyzed using ipa.

our data clearly demonstrate that tgfβ <dig> wildtype  palates from e <dig>  expressed increased tgfβ <dig> protein, double the expression of heterozygous  and as expected the homozygous  palates were completely devoid of any tgfβ <dig> expression . extracted rna samples were evaluated by rna integrity numbers  to monitor quality and degradation with bioanalyzer . we confirmed that all of the palatal rna samples had an rin ≥  <dig> , indicating the high quality and low degradation of our experimental samples . the rna libraries were prepared for cdna conversion and the samples were sequenced by illumina techniques using hiseq  <dig>  we obtained total reads from the rna-seq samples ranging from  <dig> million to  <dig> million . among all samples, only  <dig> samples have less than  <dig> million reads. we did not apply sequence manipulations on either 3′ or 5′ ends because the rna-seq sequencing quality was high across all samples based on our fastqc data quality control analysis. the relative abundance of transcripts was normalized to the total read number and shown as fragments per kilobase per million  and mapped via cufflinks.

in order to evaluate the reproducibility of our experimental samples and procedures, two independent biological and technical replicates for each gestational age and each allele resulting in  <dig>  paired-end samples were assayed
 <cit> . using the scatter plots generated by cummerbund, biological and technical replicates of our samples were validated based on the comparison of their read numbers per transcript. we detected a high correlation among both the biological and technical replicates of each gestational age and allele  . the replicates of e <dig>  of tgfβ3−/− mice are presented in figure 
 <dig>  additional scatter plots for all of the other samples with their replicates are shown in additional file
 <dig>  because the expression values  of certain cp related genes differed significantly among the gestational ages, we transformed the fpkm value of each gene into log <dig> , rounded up to  <dig> decimal places, and used transformed values for further analysis.
 <dig> 

overall transcriptome expression profile
using the r venndiagram package, we created venn diagrams to illustrate the number of transcripts in each experimental group that passed the significance and fold change  thresholds designated by cufflinks . from our overall transcriptome analyses of tgfβ <dig> knockout mice alleles , in all genotypic groups, the majority of the differentially expressed transcripts between e <dig>  and e <dig>  were upregulated: 62% for tgfΒ3−/− , 53% for tgfΒ3+/− , and 80% for wt . out of  <dig> transcripts upregulated in tgfΒ3−/−,  <dig>  were shared with wt. interestingly, a significant portion of the upregulated genes in wt  were downregulated between e <dig>  and e <dig> , but not in tgfΒ3−/−’s e <dig>  to e <dig>  . the names of the genes significantly increased from e <dig>  to e <dig>  followed by downregulation in e <dig>  and their corresponding venn diagrams are presented in additional file
 <dig>  this first-up-then-down pattern of expression suggests that these transcripts may be crucial at e <dig> , which corresponds to the stage of midline epithelial seam  degradation and palatal fusion. since it was not feasible to analyze all significantly altered genes during palatal stages, we have shortlisted the genes to be analyzed to cp-causing genes only.

identification of cp related genes and their expression patterns
following the identification of genes causing cp in humans and mice, as described in the methods, we generated a venn diagram to detect common genes between humans and mice that cause cp after becoming dysfunctional . we identified  <dig> common genes that cause cp in both species. within the human cp list, there were  <dig> transcripts that share orthologous copies with mice. we approached these genes as putative cp genes, considering that their ko models have not been generated yet. overall, the cp gene list we developed includes  <dig> genes:  <dig> genes derived from mouse and  <dig> genes derived from human databases . for an enhanced visualization of the expression values  of all cp genes , a circos image was drawn based on the circular composition of cp genes located on human chromosomes
 <cit>  .

on the basis of our differential expression profile data between genotypes and gestational ages , we decided to group and analyze the potential cp genes based on their expression patterns throughout different stages of palatogenesis. we categorized the  <dig> cp genes identified above into  <dig> possible expression patterns based on the comparison of their expression values  across the  <dig> different gestational age groups analyzed by rna-seq  . the patterns  represent the change in expression value of the transcript first from e <dig>  to e <dig> , and second from e <dig>  to e <dig> , which is explained in detail in figure 
 <dig>  the genes in each expression pattern group are listed and common genes among them are diagrammed in additional file
 <dig> 

considering the differential expression of cp genes throughout palatogenesis, we generated individual heatmaps according to the expression patterns of cp related genes and grouped them into corresponding genotypes . in tgfΒ3−/−, the majority of transcripts  were placed in p <dig>  which denotes unchanged expression of genes throughout gestation. similarly, in tgfΒ3+/− samples, the majority of transcripts were in p <dig> . surprisingly, the list of genes in p <dig> from tgfΒ3−/− and tgfΒ3+/− were highly comparable  . the genes clustered in p <dig> unique to tgfΒ3−/−, but not in tgfΒ3+/−, were chrng, foxc <dig>  h <dig>  kcnj <dig>  lhx <dig>  meox <dig>  shh, and six <dig> . we concluded that these  <dig> genes demand additional attention due to their unchanged level of expression during crucial stages of palatogenesis.
 <dig> 

finally, in wt samples, the transcripts were more equally dispersed into p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> as 29%, 32%, and 23% respectively. these results suggest that in normal mice, the majority of cp transcripts are required to be upregulated between e <dig>  and e <dig>  , which corresponds to the most crucial stages of palatogenesis- the adhesion and the fusion stages
 <cit> . some of these upregulated genes were eventually downregulated  or remained at the same expression levels , which suggest that they may contribute to the final phase of palate development.

downstream pathway analysis of cp genes
we used the ipa software to determine how the expression pattern-clustered cp genes interconnected with each other to facilitate cellular biofunctions and signaling. according to the core analysis of all cp genes  using the ipa, the most significant top  <dig> cellular functions were cellular development, gene expression, cellular growth and proliferation, cell signaling and cell morphology . although the numbers of molecules were higher in some cellular functions, the ranking was based on p-values calculated by ipa according to relevance of datasets with ikb. differentially expressed molecules clustered into go of these cellular biofunctions are tabulated in additional file
 <dig>  the pattern-oriented distribution of the top cellular biofunctions  in relation to the tgfβ pathway are illustrated with a color coded matrix with the darker color representing higher relevance between cellular functions and uploaded cp gene pattern datasets .

the cp genes unique to p <dig> of tgfΒ3−/−  may have necessary functions for the complete development of palatal shelves. therefore, we analyzed the interaction of these genes with each other, as well as with key biofunctions and tgfβ signaling using ipa . we found that  <dig> of these genes  are closely related to each other, with tnf  and ccnd <dig>  being their intersecting molecules. these genes were mostly associated with cell morphology and cell death biofunctions, and were indirectly associated with tgfβ signaling through pias <dig> .

according to ipa core analysis, there were  <dig> molecules associated with tgfβ signaling  among all of the cp genes . tgfβ signaling molecules along the pathway and their cellular locations are illustrated in figure 
 <dig>  tgfβ signaling transcripts expressed in both tgfΒ3−/− and tgfΒ3+/− were : acvr <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  bmp <dig>  crebbp, grb <dig>  inhba, inhbb, kras, map2k <dig>  map2k <dig>  nkx2- <dig>  runx <dig>  smad <dig>  tgfβ <dig>  tgfβ <dig>  tgfβr <dig>  tgfβr <dig> . all of these molecules followed the p <dig> expression pattern, which represents a uniform level of expression throughout all time points. however, within wt transcripts, tgfβ-associated molecules were almost equally distributed among p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig>  all represented tgfβ pathway molecules  were grouped into genotypes according to their expression patterns . when the significantly altered cp genes were overlaid with tgfβ signaling, all of these genes followed the smad-dependent pathway .

discussion
global transcriptome of tgfβ <dig> alleles
palatogenesis is a complex process involving multiple steps, including: palatal shelf growth, elevation, adhesion and fusion . it requires the orchestration of several key cellular functions  regulated by numerous genes and signaling pathways. it has been well documented that disruption of structural and regulatory genes involved in any stage of palatogenesis, which occurs between e <dig>  and e <dig>  in mice, contributes to the formation of cleft palate
 <cit> . on the basis of our studies and others
 <cit> , the stages from e <dig>  to e <dig>  have been identified as the most critical phases. during these stages, the palatal shelves adhere to each other with a seam and the seam begins to disintegrate in order to complete fusion, resulting in a confluent palate. therefore, we anticipated that the majority of the genes contributing to physiological palatogenesis would be progressively regulated during these phases. in this study, we took advantage of high-throughput sequencing technology, rna-seq, to quantitatively analyze the expression of transcripts in mouse embryonic palatal tissues at three developmental stages.

the integrity and quality of the isolated rna are the primary factors contributing to successful rna-seq studies
 <cit> , therefore we ensured that our palatal rna samples were of high quality based on their rin . in our study, we used the “paired end” approach for rna-seq, wherein a single 100bp-long read is sequenced at both ends, which allows the tracking of alternate splice junctions, as well as further analysis of snps, insertions and deletions; thus providing more accurate and informative sequencing results from our samples
 <cit> . we submitted the raw reads of rna-seq data  to sra and the assembly data to the transcriptome shotgun assembly database.

our global transcriptome analyses of tgfβ <dig> alleles showed that significant numbers of transcripts  were differentially expressed between e <dig>  and e <dig> , particularly within the wt fetuses, indicating functional roles of these genes during this time period of palatogenesis . interestingly, we found lower numbers of transcriptome alterations between the same time points within the tgfβ3−/− mice , which can be explained by the consequential suppression of gene clusters due to inactivation of the tgfβ <dig> gene. however it was surprising to observe that the lowest number of transcriptome changes were in tgfβ3+/− mice, n =  <dig>  which are phenotypically identical to wt mice
 <cit> . this may suggest that only this number of gene alterations is sufficient to enhance the palatal growth and fusion.

furthermore, in normal mice  the majority of transcripts were upregulated during the early transition of palatogenesis  and downregulated during the later transitions , suggesting that these are critical stages of palatogenesis requiring extensive gene regulation. this pattern of upregulated-downregulated expression suggests that particular cp genes may follow the same expression pattern to stimulate disintegration of the palatal seam, resulting in a confluent palate.

understanding the expression of cp genes
the omim and mgi databases provide up-to-date and adequately classified information about genetic diseases in humans and mice, respectively; therefore, the identification of cp related genes from either species was uncomplicated. however the merger of the information from these databases required further computer analysis to identify common and individual cp genes between the two species . to our knowledge, our list of cp genes  covers the most comprehensive number of genes , which cause cp when mutated in either species alone or both species
 <cit> .

it was expected that tgfβ <dig> allelic mice follow  <dig> different expression pattern combinations during the e <dig> -e <dig>  and the e <dig> -e <dig>  transitions . interestingly, none of the genes followed pattern  <dig>  which represents the continuous downregulation of the transcript throughout all palatal stages. we observed that the majority of the cp genes were equally clustered into p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> in wt samples , representing normal palate development . conversely, in both the tgfΒ3−/− and tgfΒ3+/− samples, almost all cp transcripts  were accumulated in p <dig>  and demonstrated high similarity between datasets  . this suggests that expression regulation of cp genes in both of these allelic mice was either delayed or abandoned.

unique tgfΒ3−/− genes following the p <dig> pattern
although the pattern of transcriptional expression between tgfΒ3−/− and tgfΒ3+/− are unexpectedly similar, phenotypic expression of cp occurs only in tgfΒ3−/− and not in tgfΒ3+/− pups
 <cit> . this suggests that the unique p <dig> genes of tgfΒ3−/−  may play crucial roles in the completion of palatogenesis. therefore, we analyzed their specific functions within the cell, their roles in palatogenesis, and their interactions with the tgfβ signaling pathway using ipa and genecards
 <cit> .

chrng  is a transmembrane glycoprotein and has been shown to play a role in neuromuscular organogenesis and ligand binding
 <cit> . mutation of chrng causes the developmental disorder multiple pterygium syndrome in humans, exhibited by isolated cp, short stature, vertebral  defects, joint contractures, and webbing of the neck, armpit, elbow, and knee
 <cit> . pterygium is also associated with irf <dig> and p <dig> mutations in humans
 <cit> , and both irf <dig> and p <dig> are known to be closely associated with tgfβ signaling. nevertheless, according to current literature, we could not find any relationships between chrng and other molecules of the tgfΒ3−/− unique p <dig> list , or the tgfβ pathway.

foxc <dig>  is a member of the forkhead box  family of transcription factors and has been shown to be functional during development of mesenchymal tissues
 <cit> . mutations in foxc <dig> are responsible for the hereditary lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome with cp observed in some patients
 <cit> . in addition, foxc <dig> is also involved in cancer metastases. in particular, expression of foxc <dig> is induced when epithelial cells undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition 
 <cit> . recently, lindley at al.  showed that foxc <dig> may play a role in emt maintenance when human mammary epithelial cells are treated with tgfβ
 <cit> . . overall, these relationships suggest that foxc <dig> could be a vital element of palatal confluency through facilitation of emt. furthermore, failure of proper foxc <dig> transcript regulation may result in cp in tgfβ3−/− fetus.

h <dig> is an imprinted maternally expressed transcript and expresses a long noncoding rna. it has been shown that an enhancer deletion affects the expression of both h <dig> and insulin-like growth factor  <dig> , thus the igf <dig> and the h <dig> genes are proposed to utilize a set of common enhancers
 <cit> . when thomas et al.  produced transgenic mice that express the igf <dig> gene under the control of the h <dig> enhancers, a large fraction of homozygous mice developed cp
 <cit> . in our network analysis , we found that h <dig> is indirectly related with tgfβ signaling through tnf, which suggests that it may play a crucial role during palatogenesis under regulation of tgfβ.

the kcnj <dig> gene encodes a member of the inwardly rectifying potassium channel family of proteins and regulates ion transmembrane transport and mutations in kcnj <dig> are associated with snowflake vitreoretinal degeneration
 <cit> . there were no significant relationships found between kcnj <dig> and other molecules of the tgfΒ3−/− unique p <dig> list , or the tgfβ pathway. however, this does not rule out its potential regulatory interaction with tgfβ signaling, and therefore demands additional studies to determine its role during palate development.

lhx <dig> is a member of the lim homeobox family of transcription factor proteins, which are involved in patterning and differentiation of various tissue types. lhx <dig> is expressed in the mesenchyme of the mouse palatal structures throughout their development
 <cit> . zhao et al.  showed that in lhx <dig> homozygous mutant embryos, the bilateral primordial palatal shelves formed and elevated normally, but they often failed to make contact and to fuse properly, resulting in a cleft secondary palate
 <cit> . inoue m et al.  proposed that the l3/lhx <dig> gene contributes to epithelial mesenchymal interactions during facial morphogenesis and that fgf-8b and tgfβ <dig> were responsible for lhx <dig> expression in the maxillary process
 <cit> . our rna-seq study of tgfβ <dig> −/− fetuses further confirmed the requirement of upregulated expression of lhx <dig> throughout palatal morphogenesis.

the meox <dig> gene  encodes a member of a subfamily of non-clustered, diverged, antennapedia-like homeobox-containing genes
 <cit> . jin et al.  found that meox <dig> is highly expressed in the posterior region of the developing palate, and the reduction of meox <dig> gene levels increased the susceptibility of mice to cleft palate through a novel post-fusion mechanism
 <cit> . the posterior cleft in e <dig>  meox <dig> −/− mice contained no epithelial cells, therefore they proposed that meox <dig> may function to strengthen the fusing zone of palatal shelves. the lack of strong fusion of epithelial cells during stable expression of meox <dig> may explain why the palatal shelves of tgfβ3−/− mice attach to each other, but fail to fuse
 <cit> . recently, valcourt et al.  showed that ectopic meox <dig> suppressed epithelial cell proliferation in cooperation with tgfβ <dig>  and mediated induction of the cell cycle inhibitor gene p21
 <cit> . furthermore, they showed that meox <dig> failed to promote emt and partially blocked tgfβ1-induced emt
 <cit> . considering the requirement of emt during palatal fusion, meox <dig> expression needs to be downregulated at the later stages of palatogenesis, as observed in both wt and tgfβ3+/− mice in our study.

sonic hedgehog, shh, is a member of the hedgehog family of secreted proteins and has been implicated as the key inductive morphogen in patterning of vertebrates during organogenesis; particularly the ventral neural tube, the anterior-posterior limb axis, and the ventral somites
 <cit> . shh signaling plays essential roles in craniofacial development by regulating a number of transcription factors and signaling interactions that take place between the epithelium and mesenchyme during normal palatogenesis
 <cit> . lan et al.  showed that shh is predominantly expressed in palatal epithelia and signals directly to the palatal mesenchyme to regulate palatal mesenchyme cell proliferation through maintenance of cyclin d <dig> and d <dig>  expression
 <cit> . recently, sasaki et al.  showed that shh expression in the palates of tgfβ3-null mice was reduced throughout e <dig> –e <dig> , and thereby proposed that shh may be involved in tgfβ <dig> regulation of normal palatal fusion
 <cit> . our results further support that upregulated expression of shh is necessary for the successful completion of palatogenesis, as observed in the tgfβ3+/− and wt mice, but not in tgfβ3−/−.

six homeobox  <dig>  is a transcription factor crucial to embryonic development by providing the necessary instructions for the formation of the forebrain and eye development
 <cit> . similar to shh
 <cit> , mutations in the homeodomain of the human six <dig> gene cause holoprosencephaly and are associated with midline facial cleft - tessier cleft 14
 <cit> . in mice, it has been shown that six <dig> protein increases expression of ccnd <dig> protein
 <cit> , which is directly related to tgfβ signaling . our results indicate that six <dig> expression has to be upregulated after e <dig>  for the precise progression of palate development. therefore, the interaction of six <dig> with tgfβ <dig> and their mechanism of activation deserve further analysis using biological techniques.

cellular biofunctions and tgfβ pathway molecules
the expression pattern-clustered cp genes interconnect each other to facilitate cellular biofunctions and canonical pathways. the relevance of these groups of gene datasets was detected using ipa core analysis .

our primary objective in this study was to analyze the transcriptomal differences among the alleles of tgfβ <dig> knockout mice. thus, it was critical to find the relationship of cp genes with the tgfβ signaling pathway, which encompasses  <dig> molecules . tgfβ <dig> controls the fusion of palatal shelves by emt and apoptosis
 <cit> . furthermore, tgfβ <dig> and tgfβ <dig> regulate mesenchymal cell proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis in the palate
 <cit> . although not all of the molecules of the tgfβ signaling pathway are associated with cp genes, it is noteworthy that all of the related cp genes followed the smad-dependent pathway. this may indicate that tgfβ <dig> regulates the cp genes through smad-signaling, with ancillary involvement of erk, pi3k, jnk, mapk, etc. thus, the promoter regions of these cp genes should be analyzed for smad-binding elements using chip-pcr or chip-seq. the majority of these cp genes followed the p <dig> expression pattern in wt mice, which represents the unchanged-downregulated expression pattern. this suggests that tgfβ molecules are required during e <dig>  and e <dig> , but are less necessary during e <dig> , which correlates with our previous findings demonstrating the sequential function of tgfβ <dig> throughout the degradation of the palatal seam
 <cit> .

overall, these sequencing and bioinformatics analysis studies are used as gene identification tools for future experiments to further understand the detailed mechanism of palate development. the  <dig> putative cp causing genes and smad-dependent tgfβ signaling molecules will be analyzed in detail using gene and protein expression studies, as well transcription factor and promoter binding assays.

CONCLUSIONS
as a result of the complexity of tgfβ signaling, apparently simple but highly important questions regarding the development of cleft palate remain unanswered, including: what is the genetic footprint of tgfβ <dig> in normal palatogenesis and how does the deregulation of tgfβ <dig> signaling cause cleft palate? in this study, we have attempted to answer these questions through the extensive quantitative transcriptome analysis of the palates of tgfβ <dig> knockout mice through rna sequencing technology. our study represents the first detailed analysis of palatal transcriptomes generated by rna-seq technology during critical stages of palatogenesis. the dataset described here will provide an enriched resource for searching transcripts that may play key regulatory roles at different stages of palatal development. furthermore, we identified  <dig> key genes which may play fundamental roles in the development of cleft palate in tgfβ3−/− mice. our combined results provide an initial understanding of the complex genetic mechanism of tgfβ3-mediated palatogenesis, and may lead to the identification of genes for the targeted prenatal treatment of cleft palate.
