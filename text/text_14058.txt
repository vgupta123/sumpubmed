BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a major human pathogen responsible for diseases including pneumonia and meningitis which are characterized by significant inflammatory responses  <cit> . such responses are associated with the release of cytokines including cxcl <dig>  also known as interleukin - <dig> as well as il- <dig>  il-1β, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor , transforming growth factor  α and β  <cit> . triggering of an inflammatory response may be due to interaction between host cells and several different bacterial factors. respiratory epithelial cells express pattern-recognition receptors  such as toll-like receptors  2– <dig> with tlr <dig> recognizing bacterial factors such as peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid  <cit> . epithelial cells expressing tlrs may release cxcl <dig> during respiratory infection which has chemotactic activity for neutrophils and monocytes  <cit> . innate immunity is also comprised of antimicrobial effectors including antimicrobial peptides which have been shown to be effective against s. pneumoniae  <cit> .

excessive inflammation can have a deleterious effect on the host and therefore treatments are sought which can moderate this response to the bacteria. a major trigger for inflammatory cytokine release from the host is thought to be the cholesterol-dependent toxin, pneumolysin. however, natural variants of pneumolysin exist with different haemolytic activity, particularly a non-haemolytic pneumolysin associated with serotype  <dig> strains of multi-locus sequence type  st <dig>  <cit> . a liposomal formulation has been designed with the specific aim of sequestering pore-forming toxins, including pneumolysin, thereby preventing it from inserting into host cell membranes and initiating the inflammatory response  <cit> . these liposomes have so far been tested on a limited number of pneumococcal strains  <cit> .

as well as the virulence factor pneumolysin, most pneumococci express one of more than  <dig> different polysaccharide capsules  <cit> . the presence or absence of polysaccharide capsule can affect cxcl <dig> release by human respiratory epithelial cells in vitro  <cit>  but whether the capsule serotype plays a role in cxcl <dig> induction is unknown. here we have tested whether clinical isolates of different serotypes induced different levels of cxcl <dig> release from respiratory epithelial cells and whether this is linked to capsule type using mutants with the same genetic background expressing capsules of different serotypes.

to date, studies on the effectiveness of liposomes have been confined to a limited number of pneumococcal strains. here we tested the effectiveness of liposomes against a panel of clinical isolates including serotype  <dig> strains of different haemolytic activity. pneumolysin mutants were also tested to determine whether these liposomes had an effect on any other cxcl8-inducing bacterial factor.

methods
bacterial strains
fourteen wild type streptococcus pneumoniae strains with different serotypes and haemolytic activity were used, including strain  <dig> , a non-haemolytic serotype  <dig> strain of st <dig>  also used were one non-encapsulated mutant of strain  <dig>   and  <dig> capsule switch mutants of strain  <dig> , for example mutant  <dig> cpsb <dig>  refers to strain  <dig>   which has had its capsule operon replaced by that of strain b <dig>  resulting in it becoming serotype 19 f  <cit> .

also,  <dig> mutants of the d <dig> strain in which the pneumolysin and/or capsule gene had been deleted were used. the d <dig> strain lacking pneumolysin  was a kind gift of jeremy brown, ucl, london. the bacteria are listed in table  <dig> and mutant construction is described in previous publications  <cit> .table  <dig> wild type and mutant s. pneumoniae strains used



bacterial culture
bacterial stocks were stored at −80 °c using protect bacterial preservers . the bacteria were plated out on columbia sheep blood agar  plates and incubated overnight at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig>  three to ten colonies were used to inoculate 5 ml brain heart infusion  broth  for overnight culture in a waterbath at 37 °c. 1 ml of the overnight culture was added to 9 ml bhi and incubated in a waterbath at 37 °c until reaching mid-log phase, od600nm =  <dig> . the bacterial cells were collected by centrifugation of 10 ml culture and were washed with minimum essential media . the pellets were re-suspended in 10 ml mem.

detroit cell culture
the human pharyngeal epithelial cell line detroit  <dig>  was cultured submerged in complete medium consisting of minimum essential media  with 10 % heat-inactivated fetal calf serum , 2 mm of l-glutamine,  <dig>  % sodium bicarbonate, 1x mem non-essential amino acid solution, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 100 μg/ml streptomycin and  <dig> u/ml penicillin  at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig>  cells were harvested using  <dig>  % trypsin-edta  when the cells reached 70–90 % confluence.

cxcl <dig>  cytokine assay
 <dig> ×  <dig> detroit cells in 1 ml mem without antibiotics, was added to each well of a 24-well plate . the plate was incubated overnight at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig> then integrity of the monolayer checked by microscopy. the medium was aspirated and  <dig>  ml mem without fcs or antibiotics added per well.

a suspension of bacteria of approximately  <dig> × 106 cfu/ml was made . serial dilutions of the suspension were plated out for accurate quantification of cfu/ml, and therefore moi.

liposomes  were provided by lascco  and have previously been shown to be neither bactericidal nor toxic to epithelial cells  <cit>  . the liposome concentrations utilized in these experiments were chosen based preliminary experiments using liposome concentration ranging from 50ug to 1 mg . therefore, 1 mg or 100 μg of liposomes were added per well followed by  <dig>  ml mem containing the bacteria  in the subsequent experiments the plate was centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 3 min at 25 °c and then incubated at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig>  for experiments involving lysis of the p <dig> strain of bacteria by antibiotic, 10 μl / well of a 10 mg/ml solution of ceftriaxone  was added after 3 h of incubation. after incubating for a total of 24 h at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig> the supernatant was collected in  <dig>  ml tubes, spun down at  <dig>  <dig> x g for 3 min at room temperature and the supernatant stored at −80 °c. cxcl <dig> concentrations were measured by elisa . experiments were performed in triplicate on three different days. mean cxcl <dig> concentration for detroit cells plus 1 mg liposomes, but no bacteria, for all experiments involving liposomes was 412 pg/ml, indicating that the liposomes do not have a cytotoxic effect on eukaryotic cells as reported previously  <cit> .

haemolysis assay
the bacteria were grown overnight on csba plates at 37 °c at 5 % co <dig> and then cultured overnight in 5 ml bhi containing 5 % fcs. 1 ml of overnight culture was added to 5 ml bhi + fcs and subcultured until od600nm  <dig> . the bacteria were then centrifuged at  <dig> x g for 10 min at room temperature and resuspended in 100 μl pbs. to release haemolysins from the bacteria, they were sonicated for 5 min on ice. in a round-bottomed 96-well plate , 50 μl pbs  was added per well along with 50 μl of bacterial sonicate or 50 μl pneumolysin  and doubling dilutions made across the plate. one row of wells was used as negative control . 50 μl of 2 % sheep red blood cell suspension in pbs was added per well and incubated for 30 min at 37 °c and lysis monitored.

to assess the significance of the results anova  or student t test was used in graphpad prism as indicated. a p value <  <dig>  was considered statistically significant.

RESULTS
clinical pneumococcal isolates varied in their induction of cxcl <dig> from epithelial cells
the cxcl <dig> response from detroit  <dig> human pharyngeal epithelial cells was measured following exposure to a selection of clinical pneumococcal isolates of different serotypes. cxcl <dig> concentrations varied according to the pneumococcal strain, ranging from 2909 pg/ml for the serotype 23 f strain to 8092 pg/ml for the serotype  <dig> strain . . the strain of serotype  <dig> induced significantly more cxcl <dig> than either the strains of serotype 23 f or 7 f  but there were no other significant differences in cxcl <dig> induction between the clinical isolates. to determine whether serotype plays a role in level of cxcl <dig> response, we compared the effects of a 6b clinical isolate  with its capsule deletion mutant  and capsule switch mutants with the same genetic background expressing capsules of eight different serotypes  i.e. with the genetic background of strain  <dig>  but expressing the capsules of the clinical strains in fig. 1a . cxcl <dig> response varied between the lowest value of 2384 pg/ml observed for serotype 18c and the highest 4209 pg/ml for the 6b parent strain but no differences were statistically significant by anova.fig.  <dig> effect of pneumococcal strains of different serotypes on cxcl <dig> induction in human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. detroit  <dig> nasopharyngeal epithelial cells were assessed for cxcl <dig> release after exposure to wildtype  or capsule switch mutant  pneumococcal strains. a strain  <dig>  induced more cxcl <dig> than either strain  <dig>  or strain  <dig>  but there were no other significant differences in cxcl <dig> induction between the clinical isolates. b no significant differences in cxcl <dig> induction were detected between any of the strains of different serotypes but the same genetic background. all experiments were performed in triplicate. serotypes are indicated in brackets, nt refers to the nontypeable capsule deletion mutant. negative control refers to detroit cells in the absence of bacteria. * indicates significant difference by anova with tukey’s post hoc test. error bars indicate standard deviation



liposomes reduced cxcl <dig> from epithelial cells exposed to different clinical pneumococcal isolates
as the most important virulence factor in inducing a cxcl <dig> response in the epithelial cells is thought to be pneumolysin, we tested the effectiveness of liposomes which absorb cholesterol-dependent toxins, such as pneumolysin, in reducing the cxcl <dig> response to different clinical pneumococcal isolates. we found that these liposomes were effective for all the pneumococcal isolates tested . 1 mg of liposomes reduced the concentration of cxcl <dig> to a mean value of  <dig>  % of that in the absence of liposomes. 100 μg reduced cxcl <dig> levels to a mean of  <dig>  % of those in the absence of liposomes. .fig.  <dig> liposomes  reduced cxcl <dig> concentration from human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells induced by different pneumococcal strains. values shown are means of three independent experiments and are the values with 1 mg or 100 μg of liposomes expressed as percentages of the cxcl <dig> concentrations obtained in the absence of liposomes in the presence of wild type clinical isolates. liposomes reduced the cxcl <dig> response to all pneumococcal strains tested. numbers in brackets indicate serotypes. error bars indicate standard deviation



lytic antibiotic is required to induce cxcl <dig> response to serotype  <dig> strain p <dig>  which was reduced by liposomes
unlike the other wild type clinical isolates in this study, strain p <dig>  serotype  <dig>  has been passaged in an animal model and has an extremely thick capsule. using the same protocol as used for the strains in figs.  <dig> and  <dig> we found no induction of cxcl <dig> release by strain p <dig> . however, treatment with the lytic antibiotic ceftriaxone enabled strain p <dig> to induce a cxcl <dig> response which was reduced by the presence of liposomes .fig.  <dig> treatment of serotype  <dig> strain p <dig> with lytic antibiotic is required for release of cxcl <dig> from human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells which is reduced by liposomes. values shown are means of three independent experiments and are the absolute cxcl <dig> concentration in the  absence of antibiotic and  following addition of the lytic antibiotic ceftriaxone in the absence or presence of 1 mg or 100 μg of liposomes. lytic antibiotic caused strain p <dig> to induce cxcl <dig> from the epithelial cells, the level of which was reduced by liposomes. * indicates significant difference. error bars indicate standard deviation



reduction of cxcl <dig> response by liposomes depended on haemolytic activity of serotype  <dig> pneumococcal strains
haemolytic activity was determined for four serotype  <dig> clinical isolates  and used to assign them as haemolytic, poorly haemolytic or non-haemolytic. the non-haemolytic strains did not trigger cxcl <dig> levels above the baseline secretion by epithelial cells suggesting that, without active pneumolysin, these strains were not releasing any other significant cxcl8-inducing factors. for the haemolytic and poorly haemolytic strains, liposomes significantly reduced cxcl <dig> concentration  . since the non-haemolytic strains did not induce cxcl <dig> production in detroit  <dig> cells, liposome treatment had no observable effect.fig.  <dig> cxcl <dig> responses of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells to serotype  <dig> pneumococcal clinical isolates with different haemolytic activities in the absence and presence  of liposomes. for the haemolytic and poorly haemolytic strains, liposomes significantly reduced cxcl <dig> concentration . the non-haemolytic strains induced so little cxcl <dig> that no reduction was observable by adding liposomes. * indicates significant difference. error bars indicate standard deviation



liposomes acted on pneumolysin and another virulence factor
to determine whether the effect of the liposomal formulation was entirely due to their ability to neutralize pneumolysin, we analysed their effect on cxcl <dig> levels from detroit cells exposed to the pneumococcal laboratory strain d <dig>  and its mutants in which pneumolysin or capsule or both had been deleted. figure  <dig> shows that, as expected, liposomes reduced cxcl <dig> levels following exposure to d <dig> strain, which possesses both capsule and pneumolysin. however, the liposomes also had a significant effect in the mutant in which the pneumolysin gene had been deleted  indicating efficacy against a proinflammatory bacterial factor other than pneumolysin. consistent with this, 1 mg liposomes also reduced cxcl <dig> concentration induced by the capsule-deficient mutant   and the mutant lacking both pneumolysin and capsule .fig.  <dig> cxcl <dig> responses of human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells to pneumococcal strain d <dig>  and its mutants lacking pneumolysin  or capsule  or both  in the absence and presence  of liposomes. liposomes reduced cxcl <dig> levels following exposure to the wildtype strain d <dig> strain but also reduced the cxcl <dig> response to its mutants lacking pneumolysin. * indicates significant difference. error bars indicate standard deviation



discussion
an excessive inflammatory response can cause damage to the host during pneumococcal diseases which may be exacerbated by treatment with lytic antibiotics as they cause release of inflammatory factors. the cholesterol-dependent toxin pneumolysin plays an important role in induction of inflammation but the presence of capsule has also been shown to have an influence  <cit> . here we determined whether the inflammatory response, as measured by release of the inflammatory cytokine cxcl <dig> from human nasopharyngeal epithelial cells in vitro, was affected by the pneumococcal serotype. the pneumococcal clinical isolates tested induced different amounts of the inflammatory cytokine cxcl <dig> . by using capsule switch mutants we have shown that capsule serotype had no significant effect on cxcl <dig> levels, under the in vitro conditions used . deletion of capsule in strain d <dig> resulted in an increase in release of cxcl <dig> from the epithelial cells but when capsule was deleted in strain  <dig>  no significant difference in cxcl <dig> was observed, suggesting a strain-specific effect. cytokine networks involved in pneumococcal infections are incompletely understood but il-1β has been shown to regulate cxcl <dig> release from epithelial cells in reponse to s. pneumoniae  <cit>  and would be an interesting target for future study. furthermore, it has also been shown, in vivo, that pneumococcal capsule could impair recognition by the innate immune system, in particular the toll-like receptor mediated pathways  <cit> . however, the most evident difference was between wild types and pneumolysin mutants indicating that pneumolysin is the predominant cxcl <dig> inducer.

liposomes designed to sequester cholesterol-dependent toxins such as pneumolysin  <cit>  caused a marked, and dose dependent, decrease in cxcl <dig> release from the epithelial cells for all the serotypes of clinical isolates tested . this indicates the potential of this liposome treatment to be effective against pneumococcal diseases caused by different pneumococcal strains in patients.

in pneumococcal meningitis mortality and morbidity are exacerbated by an excessive inflammatory response. treatment with lytic antibiotic, although effective at killing the bacteria, causes release of pneumolysin triggering an even greater inflammatory response. in an infant rat model of pneumococcal meningitis a serotype  <dig> strain  is often used to induce the disease  <cit>  and here we have shown that in vitro, following antibiotic lysis, which would release the pneumolysin, liposome treatment greatly reduced cxcl <dig> levels from the epithelial cells . this raises the possibility of a future anti-inflammatory treatment for pneumococcal meningitis including this liposomal formulation. serotype  <dig> strains are also associated with severe forms of pneumonia and with septic shock  <cit>  and so the effectiveness of the liposome treatment against this serotype, as least in vitro, is encouraging.

in nature several different alleles of pneumolysin exist with differing haemolytic activity  <cit> . serotype  <dig> has particularly been noted to include non-haemolytic and poorly-haemolytic variants. we found liposomes to be effective at reducing the cxcl <dig> response to haemolytic and poorly-haemolytic strains . non-haemolytic strains did not trigger cxcl <dig> levels above the baseline secretion by epithelial cells so liposomes did not reduce the level further. overall, the results indicate that liposomes may be useful in counteracting the inflammatory effect of a wide range of clinical pneumococcal strains of different haemolytic activity as well as different serotypes.

using pneumolysin and capsule mutants of strain d <dig> , we showed for the first time that the liposomes act not only on pneumolysin, but also significantly reduce the cxcl <dig> response to another factor which remains to be identified.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that clinical pneumococcal isolates varied in their capacity to induce cxcl <dig> production by respiratory epithelial cells. capsule type had little effect on this variation compared with pneumolysin which had the predominant effect. liposomes designed to sequester pneumolysin were extremely effective in vitro in reducing cxcl <dig> levels from epithelial cells exposed to a range of clinical pneumococcal isolates. liposomes also reduced cxcl <dig> release induced by mutant pneumococci lacking pneumolysin indicating that they also act on another factor.
