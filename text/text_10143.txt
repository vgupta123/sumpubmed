BACKGROUND
for long time it has been thought that the existence of a stable three dimensional structure is necessary for a protein molecule to be functional. nevertheless, the evidence that many proteins are unfolded in their functional state has induced, in the last decade, a re-assignment of the structure-function paradigm  <cit> . natively unfolded proteins, also known as "intrinsically unstructured" or "intrinsically disordered"  <cit>  lack a well defined tertiary structure, being functional in states made of an ensemble of flexible conformations. it is known that these proteins are involved in important cellular processes like signalling, targeting and dna binding  <cit> . it has been suggested that they may play critical roles in the development of cancer  <cit>  and in some amyloidotic diseases  <cit> ; moreover, the absence of a rigid structure allows them to bind different targets with high specificity and low affinity, suggesting that they may be hubs in protein interaction networks  <cit> . the current release  <dig>  of the disprot database  contains  <dig> proteins with different "flavours" of disorder  <cit> .

a great effort has been made to predict natively unfolded proteins through an ab-initio analysis of their amino acidic sequences. many methods have been proposed , both to predict disordered amino acids of a protein, i.e. amino acids whose atoms are hard to localize by x-ray crystallography or nmr spectroscopy  <cit> , and to define synthetic binary scalar indexes that express the probability that a protein has a global tendency to fold or to remain unfolded. it has been observed that predictors of natively unfolded proteins are, basically, functionals of the amino acidic composition  <cit> . szilagyi et al. reported that hydrophobicity and charge distributions of folded and natively unfolded proteins overlap, and, on a hydrophobicity/charge plane, there is an area occupied by proteins from both groups  <cit> . this suggests that, in the vector space of amino acidic compositions, it is not possible to find a hyper-plane separating the points corresponding to sequences of folded proteins and those corresponding to sequences of unfolded proteins, but there exists an overlap volume, that is reasonable to identify with a "twilight zone" between order and disorder  <cit> .

in this work we are interested in finding an operational method to identify proteins in this twilight zone.

in the following paragraphs of this section we outline the perspective of our work and anticipate the main results we shall present and discuss in the next sections.

in the first part of this study we revisit several methods to predict natively unfolded proteins through binary scalar indexes of folding. uversky et al. propose to analyse the mean hydrophobicity and mean net charge of the protein sequences  <cit> ; following their method, prilusky et al. developed a web-based server named foldindex  <cit> . galzitskaya et al. propose to use the mean packing of a protein sequence as an indicator of its folding status  <cit> . recently, mean pairwise energy was used to effectively discriminate folded proteins from natively unfolded ones in a peculiar set of  <dig> protein complexes  <cit> . a more refined approach is poodle-w by shimizu et al.  <cit> ; they analyse the amino acid composition of the protein sequences with a spectral graph transducer  <cit> .

we compared the performances of these predictors on several datasets. we also defined a global binary folding index, named here gvsl <dig>  using vsl <dig>  <cit> , a predictor of disordered amino acids that excellently performed in the casp <dig> experiment  <cit>  and which is an evolution of the predictors that evidenced different flavours of disorder  <cit> .

we observed that in many cases a number of sequences were differently classified by different indexes . to identify these proteins we introduced, by combining several indexes, a strictly unanimous consensus score ssu that leaves unclassified a protein if at least two indexes disagree in classifying it. we verified that proteins unclassified by ssu span, on a hydrophobicity/charge plane, an overlap area occupied both by folded and natively unfolded proteins . we checked also that these proteins have amino acidic frequencies intermediate between those of proteins that ssu predicts either as folded or natively unfolded , so we have concluded that they belong to a twilight zone in the space of amino acidic composition. proteins in this twilight zone have a flexibility intermediate between that of folded and that of natively unfolded proteins and have a dependence of chain length similar to that reported by szilagyi et al.  <cit> .

we used ssu to scan several genomes from archaea, bacteria and eukarya looking for natively unfolded proteins; the obtained percentages are similar to those already reported in the literature  <cit> ; through ssu we found robust scaling laws both in the classified and unclassified sets of proteins, of possible significance for studies in molecular evolution  <cit> .

RESULTS
performances of single indexes of folding
to compare the performance of the synthetic predictors we computed them on set a, that prilusky et al. selected to test foldindex  <cit> . the results are reported in table  <dig>  the index hq is our implementation of the algorithm described by uversky and co-workers  <cit> . mean packing and mean pairwise energy were computed following the original protocols  <cit>  . we classified a protein as natively unfolded if it had a mean packing below  <dig>  and a mean pairwise energy above - <dig>  arbitrary energy unit ; these threshold values were optimized to reach a sensitivity of at least  <dig>  and a level of false predictions as low as possible. gvsl <dig> is the arithmetic mean of the disorder scores obtained by the predictor vsl <dig>  <cit>  .

performance of hq, mean packing <p>, mean pairwise energy <ec>, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w in discriminating natively unfolded proteins from folded ones in the set a . sensitivity , specificity , rate of false positives  and the area under curve  are defined in methods. mean packing threshold is fixed at  <dig>  and mean pairwise energy threshold is fixed at - <dig>  a.e.u.

from the auc values shown in table  <dig> it is possible to rank the single indexes. we observe that mean pairwise energy, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w have about the same performance and are the best three.

to test the stability of these results over different datasets, we repeated the experiment using two other groups of proteins: set b, used by shimizu et al. to test poodle-w  <cit>  and set c, our own selection of proteins. set b contains  <dig> folded proteins with a level of disorder below 5% and  <dig> natively unfolded proteins with a level of disorder above 70%; it has been built as a very discriminative set, aiming at including either fully ordered or fully disordered proteins. set c was compiled to test the ability of previously proposed methods to separate, on one side, fully ordered folded proteins but also proteins containing a percentage of disordered amino acids above 5%, from, on the other side, fully disordered proteins containing more than 70% of disordered residues. it contains  <dig> folded proteins,  <dig> fully ordered with a level of disorder below 5% and the remaining  <dig> proteins with higher percentage of disordered amino acids. set c contains also  <dig> natively unfolded sequences with a level of disorder above 70% . the performances of the single folding indexes on set b and c are reported in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the auc values confirm that poodle-w, gvsl <dig> and mean pairwise energy <ec>are the best performing on both sets. note also that poodle-w and <ec>have a low level of false positives fp, whereas gvsl <dig> tends to have a higher sensitivity sn.

performance of hq, mean packing <p>, mean pairwise energy <ec>, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w in discriminating natively unfolded proteins from folded ones among those in the set b . mean packing threshold is set at  <dig>  and mean pairwise energy threshold is set at - <dig>  a.e.u.

performance of hq, mean packing <p>, mean pairwise energy <ec>, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w in discriminating natively unfolded proteins from folded ones among those in our own set c . mean packing threshold is fixed at  <dig>  and mean pairwise energy threshold is fixed at - <dig>  a.e.u.

it is evident the lower performance of all the indexes on set c, with respect to set b. as said above, the protocol followed by shimizu et al.  <cit>  is more restrictive; their set contains folded proteins whose average composition is different from that of unfolded ones  whereas set c, being more generic, contains a large number of untypical folded sequences. poodle-w confirms itself as the relatively best single index, both on the optimized dataset b and on the more generic dataset c.

we checked that set c includes  <dig> proteins that are complexed with peptides or other macromolecules. these proteins may be partially disordered, particularly if they are not linked with their targets. we controlled however that the changes in the performance of the indexes are negligible if we exclude these proteins. the performance of the folding indexes computed on set c purged from these  <dig> complexed proteins are included in the .

a consensus score to detect a twilight zone of amino acidic composition
in figure  <dig> we compare, in a venn diagram, the results of the predictions obtained by mean pairwise energy <ec>, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w for the  <dig> proteins in set c. we see that the three indexes predict in the same folding class  <dig> proteins, and that the indexes partly overlap, i.e. <ec>and gvsl <dig> predict in the same folding class  <dig> proteins, and there are other  <dig> proteins on which at least two indexes of folding agree. on the other hand, there are proteins that are uniquely predicted by each single folding index:  <dig> by <ec>,  <dig> by gvsl <dig> and  <dig> by poodle-w. so, globally, there are  <dig> proteins on which at least two indexes disagree.

it is reasonable to think that proteins differently classified by two single folding indexes have amino acidic frequencies different from those typical of folded and natively unfolded proteins, then they are natural candidates to belong to a twilight zone in the vector space of amino acidic compositions. to identify these proteins we used a consensus score. the use of combination scores is not new  <cit>  and a meta-server is also available  <cit> . we introduced a combination rule that we called strictly unanimous score, ssu. we decided to combine mean pairwise energy, gvsl <dig> and poodle-w because, among the global indexes here considered, they are the best performing ones . ssu classifies a protein as folded if all the indexes agree in predicting it as folded; conversely, it classifies a protein as natively unfolded if all the indexes agree in predicting it as natively unfolded; proteins are left unclassified when two indexes disagree. ssu classifies the majority of the sequences analysed : of the  <dig> folded proteins,  <dig> are left unclassified, whereas of the  <dig> natively unfolded proteins,  <dig> are left unclassified; overall, the unclassified proteins are therefore  <dig>  27% of all proteins in set c. in set b the percentage of unclassified proteins is 11%.

because of the strict unanimity clause the performances of the single indexes poodle-w, gvsl <dig> and <ec>, evaluated on a set purged by the unclassified proteins, coincides with that of ssu, here reported on sets b and c. nc is the fraction of unclassified proteins; ncf and ncu are the fraction of folded and unfolded proteins left unclassified.

note that, due to the clause of unanimity, the performance of the single indexes on sets b and c purged from the unclassified proteins coincides with that of ssu and it is improved . this improvement after filtering can be obtained only if one combines in ssu a set of indexes of comparable performances, as discussed in the second subsection of the discussion. we observe, in table  <dig>  a relatively high sensitivity, and a low level of false positives, suggesting that removing the unclassified proteins is a filter of false predictions. we checked that 68% of the false predictions of <ec>, 74% of those of gvsl <dig> and 54% of those of poodle-w are unclassified by ssu. note also the small fraction of unclassified unfolded proteins; that is essentially due to the fact that unfolded proteins are less numerous in the datasets.

since unclassified proteins by ssu are often false predictions of the single indexes, they should have an untypical amino acidic composition. we checked that on the hydrophobicity/charge plane, which is a projection of the space of amino acidic compositions . figure  <dig> refers to set b, figure  <dig> to set c. points in blue and in red correspond to experimentally determined unfolded and folded proteins, respectively. points in green and in black correspond to the proteins unclassified by ssu. to give all the information we have distinguished with green points folded unclassified proteins, and with black points unfolded unclassified proteins. it is evident that in set c folded and unfolded proteins are largely mixed up. this is due to the inclusion in the dataset of a number of protein complexes , as well as of binding, signalling, nucleic acids associated and membrane proteins . many of them could have a composition typical of unfolded proteins, but nevertheless are folded and crystallizable after binding with a ligand. we checked that the overlap decreases if we exclude these proteins from the dataset and the hydrophobicity and charge distributions tend to those of set b . note, however, that in both figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the centroids of the areas spanned by the three groups of proteins are well separated and aligned; those referring to unclassified proteins  are intermediate. interestingly, in the more curated set b, the proteins unclassified by ssu fall in a more restricted and well defined overlap area. a similar result is obtained from set c purged from complexes and ligand binding proteins . in the supplemental figure s <dig> we plot, on the hydrophobicity/charge plane, folded proteins in set c that are protein complexes or ligand binding proteins. therefore, supplemental figure s <dig> reports those folded proteins that have been excluded in supplemental figure s1; the unfolded proteins in set c are reported both in the supplemental figures s <dig>  and . let us note that unclassified proteins are not all or mostly membrane proteins, signalling and dna binding proteins. it is also clear that the centroids of the unclassified proteins are always intermediate both in the whole set c , in the set purged by untypical proteins ) and in its complement ). these observations confirm that proteins we assign to the twilight zone belong to an overlap volume in the amino acidic composition space.

amino acidic composition of proteins in the twilight zone
it is interesting to check directly whether proteins which are unclassified by ssu have amino acidic frequencies intermediate between those predicted as folded and those predicted as natively unfolded. we computed the frequencies of the amino acids for the three groups of proteins in set c. the results are reported in figure  <dig>  we see that w, c, f, i, y, v, l, h and n are more present in folded than in unfolded proteins, whereas a, r, q, s, p, e, k are more frequent in unfolded than in folded proteins; this result is consistent with that reported in the literature  <cit> . following romero et al.  <cit> , we indicate the first group of amino acids as order-promoting and the second group as disorder-promoting. we observe also that the unclassified proteins by ssu have a peculiar composition with respect to folded and natively unfolded ones; more precisely, the frequencies of w, f, i, y, v, l, q, s, p, e and k are comprised between those of proteins predicted either ad folded or natively unfolded. m, t, a, n and d have frequencies similar in the three groups of sequences. by looking at figure  <dig> one would conclude that the amino acidic composition of the unclassified proteins is substantially intermediate between those of proteins predicted as folded and those of natively unfolded. however, this could only signals that the set of unclassified proteins is a balanced mixture of folded and unfolded proteins. to exclude this hypothesis we checked that only a small fraction of unclassified proteins belong to the set of natively unfolded sequences .

we further characterized the amino acidic composition of the proteins in set c by computing the log-odds ratio s of the likelihoods, for a sequence, of being composed mainly by order-promoting or disorder-promoting amino acids . positive  values of s indicate that the sequence is composed mainly by order-promoting  amino acids  <cit> . the distributions of log-odds ratios are reported in figure  <dig> for sequences that are either classified by ssu or left unclassified. note that, visually, the s scores are not normally distributed in each group of sequences; their statistics are different as checked by wilcoxon's rank-sum test . as expected, proteins classified as folded have positive log-odds ratios . proteins classified as unfolded have negative log-odds ratios . unclassified proteins have values of the log-odds ratio distributed around zero , between those of folded and natively unfolded proteins. this means that they are composed approximately by the same number of order-promoting and disorder-promoting amino acids, i.e. their amino acidic composition is intermediate between that of folded and natively unfolded proteins. we found a similar result for set b. note that, in figure  <dig>  the frequencies of c, h, r and g in the unclassified proteins, are not comprised between those in the other two classes but are even higher than those. this means that the amino acidic composition of the unclassified proteins is not strictly in between those of folded and natively unfolded proteins. the important point to make here is: the composition in the twilight zone is different, possibly corresponding to different folding propensities.

discussion
general remarks
most global predictors of disorder rely on the amino acidic composition of protein sequences  <cit> . the distribution of the amino acids in folded proteins partly overlaps with that in natively unfolded proteins, moreover, as also noted in  <cit> , the existence of two-state homodimers, that are disordered as monomers but fold on homo-dimerization, indicates that composition alone does not determine the folding status of a sequence. in this paper we have presented the unanimous consensus score ssu; this score effectively selects proteins that, in the vector space of amino acidic composition, belong to an overlap volume occupied both by folded and natively unfolded proteins. this overlap volume has been theoretically investigated by szilagyi et al.  <cit>  as a twilight zone between order and disorder. proteins in the twilight zone, as identified by ssu, have a distribution of the log-odds ratios s concentrated around zero, statistically different and intermediate between the s distributions of folded and unfolded proteins. this suggests that proteins in the twilight zone are those with approximately the same number of order-promoting and disorder-promoting amino acids.

it is important to point out that ssu assigns proteins to the class of folded, unfolded or unclassified considering only their amino acidic composition and not the percentage of disordered amino acids they contain. so, proteins unclassified by ssu generally do not have a higher fraction of disordered amino acids than proteins classified as folded. in figure  <dig> we report the distributions of disordered amino acids in proteins assigned by ssu to the class of folded and unclassified proteins; it is evident that both classes have the same distribution. we checked that, in set c, of the  <dig> proteins with a percentage of disordered amino acids higher than 5%,  <dig> are classified by ssu as folded,  <dig> as unfolded and  <dig> are unclassified. we also checked that of the  <dig> complexed proteins alluded to in the results section and in the supplemental table st <dig> ,  <dig> are classified as folded,  <dig> as unfolded and  <dig> are unclassified. so, proteins in the twilight zone cannot directly be identified with proteins with long flexible segments or loops. in figure  <dig> we report the distributions of mean flexibility in predicted folded, unfolded and unclassified proteins . interestingly, unclassified proteins exhibit a mean flexibility  which is intermediate between that of proteins predicted folded  and natively unfolded . this suggests that the mean flexibility of proteins in the twilight zone is not directly related to the number of disordered amino acids. it will be interesting, on a case-by-case study, to investigate how the distribution of disordered amino acids correlates with the localization of flexible tracts in the proteins of the twilight zone.

an interesting point is raised by szilagyi et al.  <cit> , who underscore the relevance of the chain length for the tendency of a protein to be folded or unfolded. this suggested us to look at the distribution of lengths in the proteins of the three classes: folded, unfolded and unclassified . it is interesting to note that in all cases there is a scaling power law, but the scaling exponents are quite different in the three classes; remarkably the twilight zone has the more negative scaling exponent , indicating that proteins in this class tend to be shorter than folded and unfolded ones. we subdivided proteins of set b into different bins of length, corresponding to sequences of 50- <dig>  100- <dig>  200- <dig> and up to  <dig> amino acids, respectively. then, we estimated the extent of the projection of the twilight zone in the hydrophobicity/charge plane for each bin considered. the results are reported in graphs of supplemental figure s <dig> , where dashed lines refer to a twilight zone determined by a logistic regression similar to that in ref.  <cit> , whereas solid lines delimit the twilight zone as detailed in the methods section; our estimates of the projection of the twilight zone are given by areas delimited by parallel solid lines drawn to include, for each bin of length, not less than 75% of the dots referring to proteins left unclassified by ssu. we observe a narrowing of the extent with the increase of chain lengths, consistently with the observations in szilagyi et al.  based on a logistic regression. moreover, we have observed that the narrowing is quite independent from the choice of the threshold of 75% we use to delimit the zone. it is important to observe that the projection of the twilight zone, as selected by ssu , does not coincide with the twilight zone determined by the logistic regression in the hydrophobicity/charge plane, as done in  <cit>  . it is out of scope here to study how many and which of the proteins left unclassified by ssu are also recognized by the logistic regression in a twilight zone of the hydrophobicity/charge plane; let us only remark again that we have shown here that unclassified proteins are characterized by an s score close to zero, related to a mean flexibility which is intermediate between that of folded and unfolded proteins .

we believe that ssu can be useful as a starting point for further studies of the proteins lying in the region between order and disorder. we already used ssu in a previous work  <cit> , scanning several genomes from different kingdoms; we obtained percentages of natively unfolded proteins of about  <dig> % for archaea,  <dig> % for bacteria and  <dig> % for eukarya, consistent with those previously reported  <cit> . the percentage of unclassified proteins is of  <dig> % for archaea,  <dig> % for bacteria and  <dig> % for eukarya. we also found scaling laws: the scaling exponent of the percentage of disordered proteins as a function of the number of proteins in the genome is  <dig>  ±  <dig> , whereas the percentage of unclassified proteins scales with an exponent  <dig>  ±  <dig>   <cit> . in that analysis we combined mean packing, mean pairwise energy and gvsl <dig>  but we did not use poodle-w, since it was then unavailable to us. we are planning to extend that research using the operational combination of indexes proposed in the present study.

in the next section, at last, we propose a generic protocol on how to combine indexes into a strictly unanimous score.

a protocol for the combination of indexes able to select a reliable subset of proteins in the twilight zone
the extent of the twilight zone made of the unclassified proteins depends on the particular choice of the combined indexes. we checked that if one combines indexes with relatively low performance with more performing ones then only a small fraction of unclassified proteins corresponds to the false predictions of most single indexes. in this case many mistakenly classified proteins by the poor performing indexes are just unrecognized true positives and true negatives of the best performing ones, and then the twilight zone is poorly characterized. to avoid that we propose the following simple protocol: the folding indexes are initially ordered by decreasing values of the auc; then one or more indexes are subsequently used to form consensus scores, monitoring the parallel decrease of fp. ssu  is just the best performing single index; ssu  is the combination of the first with the second best index; ssu  the combination of the first three indexes, and so on. an enhancement of the performance of the indexes on the more and more polarized subsets is expected at each step, together with a parallel increase in the percentage of unclassified proteins. in fact, these trends are shown in table  <dig> for the indexes considered in this work; by looking at this table it is clear that, from step  <dig> on, fp tends to saturate, whereas the fraction of unclassified proteins increases. as a rule of thumb we propose to add indexes until the fp starts to saturate and we adopted this criterion in selecting poodle-w, gvsl <dig> and mean pairwise energy <ec>in the present study.

performance of unanimous scores obtained by subsequently combining different indexes, starting from the one with the highest auc, down to that with the lowest auc. ssu  refers to poodle-w alone; ssu  is obtained combining poodle-w with gvsl2; ssu  is the combination of poodle-w, gvsl <dig> and <ec>; ssu  is the combination of poodle-w, gvsl <dig>  <ec>and <p>; finally ssu  is the combination of poodle-w, gvsl <dig>  <ec>, <p>and hq; nc is the fraction of unclassified proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
it has been pointed out that the separation between order and disorder in proteins is not sharp  <cit> , but there exists a twilight zone between them. in szilagyi et al.  <cit>  the twilight zone is identified as an overlap volume in the space of amino acidic compositions, occupied both by folded and natively unfolded proteins. in this work we used the consensus score ssu to select, operationally, proteins belonging to the twilight zone, out of a generic dataset. the method can be easily adopted for large database screening, since it is easy to implement and computationally efficient. our results show that proteins unclassified by ssu: i) belong to an overlap region in the vector space of amino acidic compositions occupied by both folded and unfolded proteins; ii) are composed by approximately the same number of order-promoting and disorder-promoting amino acids; iii) have a mean flexibility intermediate between that of predicted folded proteins and that of predicted unfolded proteins. these last remarks indicate these unclassified proteins belong to a class that possibly has physical properties intermediate between those of folded and those of natively unfolded proteins.
