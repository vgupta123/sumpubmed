BACKGROUND
shigella is the primary pathogen causing bacillary dysentery in developing countries. there are an estimated  <dig>  million people worldwide infected by shigella annually; resulting in  <dig>  million deaths, most being children under five years  <cit> . a more recent study estimated approximately  <dig> million annual shigellosis cases and  <dig>  related deaths in asia  <cit> , suggesting that the death rate has decreased significantly in recent years. among the four shigella species, s. dysenteriae, s. flexneri, s. boydii, and s. sonnei, s. flexneri is the predominant species  <cit> .

s. flexneri serotyping are based on structure of the o-antigen lipopolysaccharide. there are  <dig> known serotypes: 1a, 1b, 1c, 2a, 2b, 3a, 3b, 4a, 4b, 5a, 5b,  <dig>  x, xv and y  <cit> . except for serotype  <dig>  all share a common tetrasaccharide backbone of repeating units of n-acetylglucosamine-rhamnose-rhamnose-rhamnose  <cit> . by adding glucosyl and/or o-acetyl groups to one or more of the sugars on the tetrasaccharide unit, various serotypes are formed. serotype y possesses the primary basic o-antigen without any modification of the tetrasaccharide backbone  <cit> .

it is well known that s. flexneri serotype conversion is mediated by temperate bacteriophages  <cit> . six different serotype-converting phages or prophages, sfi, sfii, sf <dig>  sfiv, sfv and sfx, have been identified and characterized  <cit> , which can convert serotype y to serotype 1a, 2a, 3b, 4a, 5a and x respectively  <cit> . except for sf <dig> which carries a single gene, oac, for acetylation of the o-antigen  <cit> , the other phages carry three genes, gtra, gtrb, and gtrtype for o-antigen modification. the first two gtr genes are highly conserved and interchangeable in function, while the third gtr gene encodes a type-specific glucosyltransferase responsible for the addition of glucosyl molecules to sugar residue on the basic o-antigen repeating unit  <cit> . these phages integrate into the s. flexneri host chromosome either at trna-thrw downstream of proa  <cit>  or at trna-argw adjacent to yfdc  <cit> . once integrated, the int and o-antigen modification genes are located at the opposition ends of the prophage genome, flanked by an attl sequence on the left and an attr sequence on the right  <cit> .

recently, untypeable or novel serotypes of s. flexneri from natural infections had been reported worldwide  <cit> . a novel serotype 1c was identified in bangladesh in the late 1980s and was a predominant serotype in vietnam and other asian countries  <cit> . serotype 1c was a result of modification of serotype 1a with addition of a glucosyl group by a cryptic prophage carrying a gtr1c gene cluster  <cit> . more recently, a new serotype named as xv emerged in china, and replaced 2a to become the most prevalent s. flexneri serotype  <cit> . although the antigenic determinant for the v variant is not yet known, the phage sfx, which is responsible for the group 7; <dig> antigenic determinant, was inducible from the sequenced s. flexneri xv strain  <dig>  <cit> . therefore emergence and spread of novel s. flexneri serotypes in nature poses a significant public health threat globally and in particular in developing countries where s. flexneri is the predominant cause of shigellosis.

in order to reveal possible roles played by the serotype-converting phages in the emergence of new serotypes, and potential of emergence of novel serotypes through this mechanism in nature, we performed infection assays using sfi and sfx, the  <dig> most common serotype-converting bacteriophages carried by s. flexneri based on serotype frequency data  <cit> . we demonstrate that a novel serotype, named serotype  <dig> d was created in laboratory by infecting s. flexneri serotype x strains with a sfi phage or by sequential infection of serotype y strain with sfx and sfi.

RESULTS
creation of a new serotype, serotype  <dig> d, through serotype conversion with phages sfi and sfx
using the procedures described by mavris et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> serotype-converting phages, sfi and sfx, were induced and isolated from s. flexneri serotype 1a strain  <dig> and serotype xv strain  <dig> respectively. the  <dig> phages were then used to sequentially infect a serotype y strain  <dig> in different order.

we first performed sequential infection in the order of sfi and sfx. by infection with sfi, the s. flexneri serotype y strain  <dig> was converted into serotype 1a , which agglutinated with both diagnostic typing sera i and grouping sera 3; <dig>  as shown in table  <dig>  strain 036_1a was then used for infection by sfx, but surprisingly, no plaques appeared, indicating the strain cannot be infected by sfx.

*y- <dig> is a synonym of grouping 3; <dig> antisera

next we performed infection in the order of sfx and sfi. the s. flexneri serotype y strain  <dig> was converted to serotype x by phage sfx infection, which agglutinated only with serotype x-specific grouping sera 7; <dig>  we named this strain as s. flexneri 036_x . when 036_x was further infected with phage sfi, it was converted to a new serotype, which agglutinated with both of the diagnostic serotype 1a-specific typing sera i and serotype x-specific grouping sera 7; <dig>  and were negative for all other type and group-specific sera . the conventional serological identification results were further confirmed by western-blot assay. as shown in figure 1c, the lipopolysaccharide  pattern of the newly constructed strain was identical to that of serotype x strain  <dig>  and that of serotype 1a strain  <dig> , when probed by group specific sera 7; <dig> and type specific sera i respectively. since the original serotype y strain and its sfi convertant 1a strain can agglutinate with grouping sera 3; <dig>  we also tested whether this antigen is detectable in serotype  <dig> d. the lps of the new serotype was not recognized by the grouping sera 3; <dig> . additionally, serotype-specific genes, gtrx for phage sfx and gtri for phage sfi, were detected from these new strains by pcr and sequencing of the pcr products.

s. flexneri serotype  <dig> has three known subtypes, 1a, 1b and 1c, the agglutination patterns of which are defined by a combination of typing and grouping sera, namely typing sera i and grouping sera 3; <dig>  for 1a, typing sera i and grouping sera  <dig> for 1b, s. flexneri group antigen specific masf b and provisional specific monoclonal antibody masf1c for 1c  <cit>  . since the newly constructed serotype agglutinates with typing sera i, but showed a different serological pattern from all known serotype  <dig> subtypes , we named this new serotype  <dig> d.

in order to determine whether such serotype-converting events could occur in nature, we randomly selected  <dig> s. flexneri serotype x strains in our collection, and infected them with serotype-converting phage sfi. all  <dig> strains tested were successfully converted to serotype  <dig> d.

we have no good explanation why serotype 1a strain 036_1a, constructed from  <dig> by infection with sfi, could not be further infected by sfx. we randomly selected  <dig> s. flexneri 1a isolates from our collection for infection by sfx but found that none of them could be infected by sfx. clearly, the sfi can infect the strains carrying serotype-converting phage sfx, but not vice versa, likely due to phage immunity from modified o-antigen receptors  <cit> .

interestingly, a recent study reported s. flexneri strains with identical serological characteristics to the novel serotype  <dig> d created in this study  <cit> . four strains were designated as untypeable serotype i:  among  <dig> s. flexneri isolates collected in a passive surveillance project from henan, china in  <dig>  <cit> . thus it seems that this novel serotype has already appeared in natural infections. although serotype  <dig> d represented less than 1% of the isolates, it would be important to monitor this new serotype epidemiologically, considering that novel s. flexneri serotypes such as 1c and xv achieved its dominance among the s. flexneri serotypes in a very short time frame  <cit> 

sfi and sfx integrated in tandem into the same site of host chromosome
it has been observed that the serotype-converting phages, except for sf <dig>  usually integrate into the trna-thrw gene of the host chromosome, which is adjacent to proa upstream  <cit> . however, the gene downstream the integrated phage have not been consistently identified  <cit> . genomic analysis of s. flexneri serotype 2a strain  <dig> ,  <dig> t  and serotype xv strain  <dig>  showed that the serotype-converting phages were all integrated upstream of host gene yaic. thus cross-bridging pcr analyses of s. flexneri  <dig>  036_x, and 036_1d across the proa-yaic region were conducted using a series of primers and found that both phages sfx and sfi were integrated into the trna-thrw site, which is immediately downstream of gene proa, and upstream of gene yaic . the phage sfi was found to be integrated immediately upstream of sfx genome, with an att site at both ends . by comparing the joining sequences between the serotype-converting phage genomes, we found that the phage sfi was integrated at the attl site of phage sfx . the integration site for the  <dig> serotype x isolates converted by sfi was also found to be the same site and thus it appears that the integration is very site specific.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel serotype  <dig> d was constructed by sequentially infecting a serotype y strain of s. flexneri with phage sfx and sfi, or by infecting clinical serotype x isolates with sfi. these results indicate that serotype conversion with phages sfi and sfx could occur in nature. however, the observation that the order of infection by the  <dig> phages affects convertibility of a strain indicates that serotype conversion is not only determined by the modification specific genes but also constrained by the properties of the serotype-converting phages. our findings provide possible mechanisms how new serotypes of s. flexneri could emerge in nature.
