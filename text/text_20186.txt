BACKGROUND
defensins are small cationic peptides with a characteristic conserved six cysteine signature and are present in a wide range of species from insects to plants and animals. on the basis of differences in their size and their cysteine residue spacing, mammalian defensins are divided into α, β, and θ sub-classes  <cit> . α-defensins are characterised by having disulphide bonds between cysteines in positions 1– <dig>  2– <dig> and 3– <dig> whereas the cysteine disulphide bonds of β-defensins lie between  <dig> and  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the third type, θ-defensins are a recently acquired primate specific class of peptide, which are formed by the merging of the other two class of defensins  <cit> . the sub category β-defensins are most numerous among vertebrates and have been extensively studied. their usual gene structure consists of  <dig> exons, the first exon containing the 5’ untranslated region and signal peptide of the preproprotein; the second encoding the mature peptide with the characteristic conserved six cysteine domain  <cit> .

β-defensins are produced by phagocytic cells, leukocytes and epithelial cells within the gastrointestinal tract, liver, skin and lungs  <cit>  and constitute an important and versatile component of the innate immune system  <cit> . originally described as anti-microbial peptides  because of their microbicidal activity  <cit> , additional immunoregulatory and stimulatory functions has led to the term host defence peptide  <cit> . it is now known that β-defensins link the innate and adaptive immune responses in higher organisms, by acting as signalling molecules in the immune system and chemoattractants for t-lymphocytes and immature dendritic cells  <cit> . more recently a role in fertility has been also demonstrated for these pleiotropic molecules  <cit> .

many studies have documented expression of β-defensin genes along the epididymis, particularly in the caudal region of the epididymis  <cit> . the epididymis is a single, convoluted duct, which can reach about 50 m in length in sheep and up to 80 m in horses. attached along the caudomedial border of the testis, the epididymis can be divided into three main segments, the caput , corpus  and cauda , which finally tapers into the vas deferens. it is through this tube that sperm progressively acquire functional competency for fertilisation, and therefore characteristic highly regionalised gene and protein expression profiles give rise to a dynamic intraluminal environment  <cit> . one particular β-defensin,  has been documented to play a number of roles critical to sperm survival, motility and interaction with the female reproductive tract and its secretions . a dinucleotide deletion in the human bd <dig> gene has also been associated with subfertility in men  <cit> . in agreement with their broad role in reproductive physiology, a recent study has also shown that β-defensin gene knock-out male mice are infertile  <cit> .

extensive analysis of β-defensin gene expression profiles have been performed in humans and model-organisms, the same is not true for the majority of livestock species. our group discovered a cluster of novel β-defensin genes in the bovine genome  <cit>  which were preferentially expressed in the reproductive tract in the bull  <cit> . immunohistochemistry and western-blotting showed that bovine bd <dig>  exists as a dimer expressed by epithelial cells of the caudal epididymis and vas deferens and coats sperm  <cit> . furthermore, addition of the recombinant bbd <dig> protein induces increased motility of immature corpus sperm  <cit> .

to date, only two β-defensin genes have been characterised in sheep in any detail. originally discovered in  <dig>  sheep β-defensin  <dig>  and  <dig>  were identified in the trachea and ileum, respectively  <cit> . obd <dig> mrna and peptide expression were highest in the intestinal tract and tissue distribution progressively decreases with maturity  <cit> . the induction of these amps in response to viral and bacterial infection suggests they may play a role in mediating disease resistance  <cit> , however their expression in reproductive tissues has not previously been assessed.

here, we used a comparative genomics approach to identify and classify β-defensin genes in the ovine reference genome. based on our work in related species  <cit> , expression profiling was used to validate these predicted sequences and provide insight into a potential functional role for these novel genes.

methods
bioinformatic identification of ovine β-defensin orthologs
all  <dig> characterised bovine β-defensin genes  <cit>  were used to identify orthologs in the ovis aries genome  via the basic local alignment search tool   <cit>  using tblastn, which compares the query peptide sequence to the subject dna translated in all six open reading frames. only sequences exceeding 70% identity and 50% coverage were selected for further study. the  <dig> predicted ovis aries β-defensin protein sequences were aligned using clustal omega  <cit>  and jalview  <cit> . identified ovine β-defensin peptide sequences were also searched against the uniprot and ensembl database to identify any β-defensin homologs not found using the ncbi database reference genome. chromosomal locations and exon/intron boundaries were determined by blast-like alignment tool  and reconfirmed via genscan  <cit> .

blast retrieved ovine β-defensin sequences often had to be manually completed before phylogenetic analysis could be carried out properly, due to short sequence length and sequence diversity of the β-defensins. missing first exons for obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd109a were discovered by extracting a section of the sheep reference genome via ncbi genome browser that lay between the defensin of interest and the nearest upstream β-defensin. these chromosomal intervals were then translated via linux based emboss transeq into all six open reading frames. the bovine first exons most closely related to the ovine β-defensin gene of interest were aligned to this translation to find a potential first exon. the new first exons and their respective second exons were then aligned to the entire bovine and sheep β-defensin repertoire to determine similarity. first exons for obd <dig>  spag11e and obd <dig> could not be found using this method, as the alignment of the bovine first exons to the region of interest proved inconclusive due to low similarity and coverage.

hidden markov models  searches of the ovine reference sequence were also carried out to identify novel β-defensin sequences. to achieve this, genome intervals in which the β-defensin clusters lay were translated into all six open reading frames using the linux based emboss transeq  <cit> . the hmm was then built using a t-coffee alignment of the entire bovine and ovine characterised β-defensin repertoire, as well as the newly identified ovine β-defensin genes that exhibited high similarity to the bovine β-defensins, and the hmmbuild program in the hmmer  <dig> . <dig> software package  <cit> . the nucleotide sequences were subsequently aligned using t-coffee  <cit>  to determine putative domains between the cattle and sheep β-defensins.

second exons were also evaluated and manually edited. ovine genes obd125a, obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd109a, obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd <dig> did not have stop codons at the 3’ end of the second exons. a custom python script was written to extend all ovine defensins to the nearest in frame stop codon. the extended sequences were then aligned with the rest of the ovine β-defensins. to ensure that the extensions identified were not a result of poor genome assembly, sequences were then searched against the ncbi genome database to determine whether they existed in other organisms. with exception to obd <dig> and obd <dig>  all extensions existed in  <dig> or more different species, including capra hircus , turisops truncates  and canis lupus .

all ovine β-defensin gene and protein sequences  are available in additional file  <dig> 

phylogenetic and syntenic analysis
β-defensin gene sequences with identified first and second exons were aligned via clustalw <dig> with gap open and extension penalties of  <dig> and  <dig> , respectively. the phylogenetic relationship between the β-defensin gene repertoire of cattle and sheep was then investigated via mega  <dig>   <cit> , using the maximum likelihood method and a bootstrapping value of  <dig> for each tree constructed. upon identifying both exon/intron boundaries and phylogeny, the conserved gene orientation between the different chromosomal clusters of β-defensins of both sheep and cattle was investigated and illustrated via arkmap  <cit> .

reproductive tissue collection, rna extraction and cdna synthesis
tissues were aseptically collected at a local abattoir from healthy rams  within 30 min of slaughter. reproductive tracts were retrieved from post pubertal 12 month old suffolk rams and dissected to obtain 3 mm sized tissue samples of testis , caput , corpus  and cauda  of the epididymis as well as the vas deferens . each tissue sample that was collected was preserved in rnalater  and stored at -20 °c.

rna was extracted using trizol and rneasy plus mini kit with on-column dna digestion . the quantity of the purified rna was measured using nanodrop nd- <dig> uv–vis spectrophotometer . the quality of rna was assessed on agilent  <dig> bioanalyzer using agilent rna  <dig> nano kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions . rna integrity numbers  > <dig> were obtained for all samples and the rna stored at -80 °c. the high-capacity cdna reverse transcription kit  was used to convert 200 ng of rna into cdna as per manufacturer’s instructions. the reverse transcription process was carried out under the following conditions: 10 min at 25 °c, 120 min at 37 °c and 5 min at 85 °c. the stock cdna was stored at -20 °c.

primer design, qpcr and data analysis
intron-spanning gene-specific primers were designed using primer  <dig> . for obd122/obd122a and obd125/obd125a, primers were designed to amplify products from regions of exon  <dig> containing different nucleotides to maximise the chances of differentiating between the closely related sequences. primer specificity was confirmed by primer blast  before commercial synthesis .

quantitative rt-pcr  was performed on applied biosystems  <dig> fast real-time pcr system, using sybr green intercalating dna dye, according to the manufacturer’s instructions . the reaction efficiency for each primer pair was calculated using a two-fold dilution series on a pooled cdna sample, obtained by pooling 2 μl of cdna from each sample in a single eppendorf tube. the standard curves were represented as the semi-log regression line plot of ct value vs. log of the relative input cdna concentration. the efficiencies between 85% and 110% were considered acceptable and primers with efficiencies within these limits were included. all genes were normalised to the expression of actb as a reference gene. the software package genex  <dig> . <dig>   was used for qpcr data analyses  <cit> . melt curve analysis was also performed to ensure a single product was formed and to ensure minimal formation of primer-dimer artefacts. data obtained for obd <dig> and obd <dig> were excluded as expression levels were low in all tissues assessed and primer amplification excluded reliable quantification of product. the amount of target, normalised to an endogenous reference and relative to a calibrator, was: 2-ΔΔct, where Δct is the difference in ct between target and reference and ΔΔct is the difference in Δct between all the samples and the calibrator, the sample with the lowest expression  <cit> . the differences in gene expression levels between tissue segments were analysed by anova and tukey post-hoc test as implemented in graphpad prism .

RESULTS
prediction of β-defensin genes in the ovine reference genome
bovine β-defensin genes, some of which were previously discovered by our group  <cit> , were used to search the ovine reference genome to identify evolutionarily conserved orthologs. of the  <dig> resulting hits,  <dig> passed the cut offs which included 50% sequence coverage, 70% sequence identity and an e-value of 10^- <dig> or lower. all of the resulting hits had at least 80% sequence identity, indicating a high likelihood of β-defensin homology. additionally, the previously annotated obd <dig> and obd <dig> were also identified as having similarity with  <dig> β-defensins on chromosome  <dig>  though the similarity was always between  <dig> and 69%. of the  <dig> hits, obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd109a and spag11e did not have first exons identified via a blast hit. all first exons of the above genes, as well as the first exons for bovine defensins bd <dig> and bd <dig> were discovered after parsing through the genomic region the exons were predicted to lie within and making local alignments of first exons of genes that share high similarity with the missing first exons. the first exons of obd <dig> and spag11e however could not be identified using this method, as the first exons of the bovine ortholog could not be accurately aligned to any part of the sheep genome possibly due to incomplete sequence assembly. additionally, obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd122a, obd <dig>  obd109a and obd <dig> were found not to extend to their first in frame stop codon after analysis of the flanking genomic regions of the second exons. as such, each of these genes were extended to the first in frame termination site.

on the basis of these filtered hits, all  <dig> putative novel ovine β-defensin genes plus two previously characterised ovine β-defensins  were aligned . the characteristic  <dig> cysteine signature was conserved in all β-defensins, although the spacing between cysteines varied. the cysteines represent the only sites at which the amino acid sequences are 100% conserved, with significant diversity between amino acid residues constituting the remainder of exon  <dig> fig.  <dig> jalview multiple sequence alignment of the second exons of the  <dig> ovine β-defensins highlighting the conserved cysteine residues  characteristic of β-defensin genes. the level of amino acid conservation is shown at the bottom of the figure




obd <dig> has only  <dig> cysteines in its sequence, which differs from the usual  <dig> cysteine defensin motif. obd <dig>  shares high similarity with bbd <dig> between their first exon and the first half of the second exon. however, the second half of the second exon differs greatly from any other defensin gene. upon further analysis, it was discovered that a thymine base is missing from the reference genome, causing a frameshift leading to the generation of an incomplete second exon and thus a vastly different mature peptide. whether this is an assembly issue or a prevalent mutation in the population remains unclear.

in contrast obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd <dig> all contain an additional cysteine, all of which occur after the 6th canonical one .

analysis of ovine and bovine β-defensin phylogeny and gene order conservation –  <dig> distinct genomic clusters
upon completion of the first and second exon annotation of the  <dig> newly characterised ovine β-defensins, a phylogenetic analysis was carried out using mega  <dig>  to determine the phylogeny between the bovine and ovine β-defensin sequences. newly annotated ovine β-defensins were named based on their sequence similarity with the bovine β-defensin with which it was found. results indicate a strong evolutionary relationship between the bovine and ovine genes. however, due to the short sequence length, high phylogenetic support can usually only be determined between homologs of high similarity . clear 1: <dig> orthologs of ovine bd <dig> and bd <dig> are not present in the bovine genome but both showed a uniform similarity with the  <dig> member bnbd gene family in bos taurus, and had 1% greater similarity with bnbd <dig>  as indicated by the phylogenetic tree .fig.  <dig>  maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree for ovine β-defensin proteins compared to their bovine orthologs on  chromosome  <dig> and  chromosome  <dig>  respectively. trees were constructed using full length β-defensin sequences from bos taurus and ovis aries aligned via clustal omega, representing two of four β-defensin clusters. the values at each node represent percentage bootstrap scores at  <dig> iterations




the gene order conservation of β-defensin gene clusters between bovine and ovine β-defensins was investigated and the chromosomal arrangement or overall defensin orientation of these genes agreed with what we previously published in cattle  <cit> . four distinct clusters were identified, and to ensure consistency for comparison to closely related species were named clusters a to d. the similarity in gene orientation of ovine chromosome  <dig> is highly similar to bovine chromosome  <dig> with the exception of a possible inversion in gene order . bovine chromosome  <dig> shares 1: <dig> gene orientation with sheep chromosome  <dig> , as does chromosome  <dig> in sheep with chromosome  <dig> in cattle . in contrast, the conservation of gene order between ovine chromosome  <dig> and bovine chromosome  <dig> is very low, with many genes missing from the ovine chromosome  <dig> repertoires .fig.  <dig> gene order maps of the four β-defensin clusters found in bos taurus and ovis aries, respectively. clusters are denoted a ; b ; c  and d . genes without connecting vectors have no match within the other species




cluster a consists of  <dig> genes located on chromosome  <dig> in sheep and  <dig> in cattle . cluster b consists of  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> in sheep . cluster c consists of  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> ; and finally, cluster d consists of  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig> .

sequence matches for bovine tap, bbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig>  bnbd <dig> bnbd <dig>  eap, lap and bt <dig> could not be conclusively identified in the sheep genome, as each of these genes matched sheep β-defensin  <dig> and  <dig> with almost uniform similarity . of the  <dig> new ovine genes identified,  <dig> had been provisionally characterised at the computational level previously . as indicated in fig.  <dig>  there is a high level of conservation in gene order between  <dig> of the four clusters. a clear feature of this conservation is that the defensin clusters span similar chromosomal distances between cattle and sheep. bovine β-defensin cluster on chromosome  <dig> spans  <dig>  nucleotide bases. similarly, the sheep cluster on chromosome  <dig> spans  <dig>  bases. likewise, there is only a difference of  <dig>  bases between cattle chromosome  <dig> and sheep  <dig> and a difference of  <dig>  bases between chromosome  <dig> and  <dig>  in contrast, bovine β-defensin cluster on chromosome  <dig> spans  <dig>  bases, whereas, the ovine cluster on chromosome  <dig> spans only  <dig>  bases.

expression of novel β-defensins in reproductive tissues of the ram
the expression profiles of  <dig> β-defensin genes, which included the previously examined obd <dig> and obd <dig>  were examined across the five distinct tissues , caput , corpus  and cauda  epididymis as well as the vas deferens ) from mature rams . the genes were chosen to represent each of the four gene clusters  and corresponding to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in sheep, respectively.fig.  <dig> relative gene expression profiles for β-defensin genes across reproductive tissues of the ram  and clustered by chromosomal location. a genes on ovine chromosome 2;  genes on ovine chromosome 13;  genes on ovine chromosome  <dig> and  genes on ovine chromosome  <dig>  tissues are identified on the x-axis; t-testes; e-ct, caput epididymis; e-cs, corpus epididymus; e-ca, cauda epididymis and vd, vas deferens. significant differences are denoted with different subscripts above each box-plot 




cluster a –differential expression was detected between tissue sections for all four genes ; p <  <dig> ). for each gene in the cluster, lowest gene expression was detected in the testes, and maximal gene expression in the epididymis. obd <dig> showed significantly elevated expression in the corpus epididymis as well as the vas deferens relative to the expression level in the testes. expression of obd <dig> was significantly elevated in all epididymal regions and vas deferens compared to the testes. similarly, obd <dig> expression was significantly higher in e-cs than in the testes. a significant increase in obd <dig> expression was detected in the cauda, relative to the testes.

cluster b –differential expression was detected between tissue sections for  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes characterised by qpcr in this cluster ; p <  <dig> ). interestingly, whereas obd <dig> was significantly differentially expressed, its closely related counterpart obd125a was not. maximal gene expression levels were detected in the testes for only three genes – obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd <dig> expression was significantly lower in the e-cl, and obd <dig> exhibited significantly lower expression in all three epididymal regions relative to the testes. maximal gene expression levels were detected in the e-ct for obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd <dig>  obd122a and obd <dig>  maximal gene expression levels were detected in the corpus epididymis for only obd <dig>  obd <dig> and obd125a. only obd <dig> and obd <dig> showed maximal gene expression in the cauda epididymis. no gene exhibited maximal expression in the vas deferens. in general, inter-ram gene expression levels were found to be most variable in the vas deferens.

cluster c – two of the three genes characterised in this cluster showed significant differential expression between tissue sections ; p <  <dig> ). in both cases, gene expression was lowest in the testes and significantly elevated in all epididymal regions. gene expression for obd <dig> was significantly reduced in the vas deferens .

cluster d – twelve genes in this cluster were assessed and differential expression was detected between tissue sections for seven genes ; p <  <dig> ). this cluster contains the two already characterised ovine β-defensins, obd <dig> and obd <dig>  whereas obd <dig> was significantly elevated in the caput and the corpus epididymis compared to the testes, obd <dig> was not differentially expressed. all significantly differentially expressed genes  exhibited maximal expression in the caput. a general trend of reduced expression was apparent for these genes in the cauda epididymis and vas deferens.

of the  <dig> genes profiled by qpcr,  <dig> were found to be significantly differentially expressed across reproductive tissues of the ram. no clear differences in expression profile between chromosomal clusters were observed.

discussion
although defensins have been extensively characterised in humans, rodents, chickens and cattle, β-defensin families remain uncharacterised in many non-model organisms. identifying novel amps in diverse species has significant potential for understanding the evolutionary history of this important gene family and also for application in breeding programmes for multiple livestock species  <cit> . the increasing availability of genomic sequence data via advances in next-generation sequencing facilitates a more comprehensive assessment of the β-defensin gene complement across species. a comparative genomics approach has previously been used to identify new gene families in chickens, cattle and horses  <cit> . species specific differences in β-defensin gene number suggest that multiple gene-duplication events and sequence diversification in the lineage leading to mammals has resulted in many β-defensins with divergent amino acid composition but almost identical tertiary structures, even amongst closely related species  <cit> . this could possibly be due to the specific pathogenic niche-based insults members of closely related species are exposed to over the course of their evolution  <cit> .

the identification of  <dig> novel β-defensin genes in the ovis aries genome here brings the current tally of β-defensin genes characterised to  <dig>  but the final number is likely to change in line with increasingly accurate annotation of the ovine reference genome. the comparison of the  <dig> bovine β-defensin clusters which share a high level of gene order conservation with the ovine β-defensin clusters in this study indicates common ancestry for these genes, as well as positive selective pressure to maintain these genes through the divergence of the different ruminant species. comparison of the bovine chromosome  <dig> cluster to the ovine chromosome  <dig> cluster reveals an expansion of bovine β-defensins not seen in ovis aries illustrating the discontinuous nature of the β-defensin catalogue in mammals, where in some cases individual genes can be gained or lost, perhaps due to varying niche-based pathogenic insults. future more accurate annotation of livestock genomes will likely shed light on the specific genomic changes in β-defensin gene repertoire between species.

bovinae and caprinae  diverged about  <dig> million years ago  <cit>  and a plausible explanation for the selection pressure which originally drove the expansion of large β-defensin gene families was postulated to be the evolution of the rumen . it is thought that the complexity of the microbial populations within the rumen required a vast array of defence peptides to manage the mucosal interface and prevent dissemination resulting in inflammation and disease. however, the presence of these genes in monogastrics including horses  <cit>  and pigs  <cit>  supports an alternative rationale. while the retention of these genes in monogastrics does not exclude a role in managing the mucosal microflora, it is likely that defensins play a more widespread and direct role in immunoprotection across body surfaces in mammals.

only two β-defensin genes have previously been characterised in sheep , and their expression documented in mucosal tissue in the trachea and ileum  <cit> . however, no previous study examined expression of these or related sequences in reproductive tissues in sheep. here, we demonstrate extensive but site-specific expression of an expanded repertoire of  <dig> β-defensin genes in the reproductive tract of the ram. in agreement with our previous results in cattle, expression of all of these genes is highest in the epididymis and particularly in the caudal region  <cit> , suggesting a role for these molecules in sperm function and fertility.

a remarkable recent discovery has been the identification of a seminal fluid microbiome in mice  <cit> . it is logical, given the abundance of amino acids and other nutritional substrates in basic seminal fluid, that it would promote bacterial growth. in fact, researchers now propose that this microbiome impacts directly on the etiology of infertility  <cit> . in this context, it now seems plausible to propose that β-defensins evolved to regulate the microbiome in seminal fluid and prevent the growth of bacterial populations that may be detrimental to either sperm quality or uterine health. however, detailed follow on studies are required to further investigate this hypothesis. the expression of all evaluated β-defensins in the reproductive tract of the ram  shown here highlights the priority to which prevention of ascending infection acquired over the course of evolution. it is relevant that infectious epididymitis is considered a major cause of economic losses for the sheep industry worldwide  <cit>  and future work should examine the potential efficacy of epididymal β-defensins against the causative bacteria.

CONCLUSIONS
the high level of gene expression and region-specific changes in β-defensin gene expression suggest epididymal specific roles for these molecules during sperm maturation in sheep, in line with what has been documented in other species. this bioinformatics search and validation has brought the current number of β-defensin genes in sheep to  <dig>  increasing our knowledge of the structure and composition of amp related genes sheds light on the divergent evolution of the immune system of different ruminants, as well as identifying new targets to breed for traits of agricultural and economic importance.
