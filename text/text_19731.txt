BACKGROUND
plant defensins are a family of small , basic, cysteine-rich proteins that are widespread in the plant kingdom and have been described in various tissues and species  <cit> . many, but not all plant defensins, have potent antifungal activity and thus have generated interest in their application for control of fungal disease in crop plants  <cit> .

plant defensins are divided into two classes based on precursor proteins predicted from cdna clones  <cit> . class i defensin precursors have an endoplasmic reticulum  signal peptide and a defensin domain. defensins from this class enter the er where they are folded and subsequently secreted via the default pathway into the extracellular space  <cit> . many of the well-characterised seed defensins belong to this class  <cit> .

class ii defensins have an additional c-terminal propeptide  of about  <dig> amino acids. most members of this class are produced by solanaceous species where they are expressed constitutively in floral tissues and fruit, and are induced in leaves during salt-stress . however, a small number of defensins with ctpps have been discovered outside the solanaceae such as zmesr- <dig>  from maize   <cit> . the ctpps from nad <dig> , phd <dig> and phd <dig>  are not present on the mature, biologically active defensins  <cit> . this led to our hypothesis that the ctpp could be a vacuolar targeting signal  since vtss are removed from vacuolar proteins during transit to, or deposition in the vacuole and unlike the extracellular class i defensins  <cit>  the nad <dig> defensin is deposited in the vacuole  <cit> .

the ctpps of solanaceous class ii defensins carry an overall negative charge that closely matches and counter-balances the positive charge of the defensin domain  <cit> . this led us to ask whether the ctpp could have an additional role in protein folding and/or protein detoxification   <cit>  like the propeptides on plant α-/β-thionins and mammalian defensins that share an analogous charge disparity between their pro- and mature protein domains  <cit> .

in a recent paper  <cit> , we described the production and performance of transgenic cotton plants expressing the natural nad <dig> precursor consisting of the mature  <dig> amino acid defensin domain flanked by an er signal peptide and the  <dig> amino acid ctpp. these plants were phenotypically indistinguishable from the non-transgenic parents and exhibited enhanced resistance to both fusarium and verticillium wilt over three years of field trials.

in this paper, we investigated the role of the  <dig> amino acid ctpp of nad <dig> by generating transgenic cotton plants expressing nad <dig> without the ctpp to determine its effect on vacuolar targeting and potential phytotoxicity. furthermore, we examined whether the defensin ctpp was sufficient to direct cytosolic green fluorescent protein to the vacuole.

RESULTS
production of transgenic cotton
twelve pcr-positive primary transgenic plants  representing  <dig> transgenic events were produced with the phex <dig>  construct . all of these plants had detectable levels of nad <dig> in the leaves as determined by elisa . an immunoreactive protein of ~5 kda protein was observed on protein blots of leaf extracts from lines  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> consistent with the size of mature nad <dig> . in contrast, immunoreactive proteins of ~5 kda and ~9 kda were present in leaf extracts from the transgenic cotton line d <dig> , consistent with the sizes of mature nad <dig> and pronad <dig> , respectively . fifty-eight primary transgenic plants representing  <dig> transgenic events were produced with the phex <dig>  construct. ten plants , all representing different events, were either infertile and/or had distorted or small leaves. the remaining plants had a normal phenotype and were fertile. in contrast,  <dig> of the  <dig> primary phex <dig> transgenic plants , representing nine events, exhibited distorted or small leaves and/or short internodes . furthermore, seven of these  <dig> primary transformants were infertile . two of the primary phex <dig> transformants  had a normal phenotype.

characterisation of segregating t <dig> transgenic plants
to determine if the abnormal phenotype of the phex <dig> transformed cotton plants segregated with the nad <dig> gene, seed from the four fertile transgenic events  were planted in the greenhouse and the germinated t <dig> plants were assessed for nad <dig> accumulation, number of transgene inserts and phenotype. pcr screening of the t <dig> plants indicated that the primary transgenic plants  of lines  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> had only one copy of the transgene nad <dig> . real-time pcr revealed the distribution of homozygous, hemizygous and null plants expected for a single insertion  and southern blot analysis confirmed single inserts . there were very few null plants in the segregating t <dig> populations of lines  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> which is consistent with the presence of more than one transgene insertion in the primary transgenic plants .

*hom = homozygous, hem = hemizygous, mc = multicopy lines, zygosity not determined. nad <dig> levels were determined 6 weeks after sowing. ppm = ng nad1/mg wet weight tissue.

phytotoxicity was observed in the phex <dig>  segregating t <dig> plants that was correlated with the level of nad <dig> in the leaves. all the leaves on line  <dig> . <dig> homozygous plants, which had the highest levels of nad <dig>  were severely distorted  and these plants were shorter than the null plants. furthermore, line  <dig> . <dig> homozygous plants were either infertile or produced fewer bolls that were smaller and had less seed than the null plants . all null plants had a normal phenotype  whereas the hemizygous  <dig> . <dig> plants had a phenotype that was intermediate between that of the homozygous and null plants. that is, there was moderate distortion of the leaves  and some reduction in seed production. in comparison, line d <dig> homozygous plants  had a normal phenotype .

homozygous plants of line  <dig> . <dig> exhibited some phytotoxicity but it was much less obvious than for line  <dig> . <dig> and was correlated with lower nad <dig> expression levels in leaf tissue. there was no difference in leaf morphology between line  <dig> . <dig> transgenic plants and the nulls in the first few weeks, but as the plants matured, some leaf distortion was observed . at 87 days after sowing, when plants were flowering, the homozygous plants were shorter and more spindly than the null plants . hemizygous line  <dig> . <dig> plants had an intermediate phenotype between homozygous and null plants . all line  <dig> . <dig> transgenic plants were fertile although some bolls were smaller than the bolls from null plants . the t <dig> line  <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> . <dig> plants had, on average, less nad <dig> at  <dig>  and  <dig>  ppm than the other two transgenic lines, respectively. they had normal phenotype and were fertile .

cellular structure of leaves from transgenic cotton plants
leaves from the non-transgenic coker control and line d <dig>  plants presented characteristic, well-ordered arrangements of upper epidermal, palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll and lower epidermal cells . in contrast, cells in the leaves of homozygous line  <dig> . <dig> plants were more irregular in shape and the cell layers were disordered. this observation may explain the altered  leaf morphology presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> 

subcellular location of nad <dig> in transgenic cotton plants
sections from leaves taken from equivalent positions on the homozygous line d <dig>  and line  <dig> . <dig>  transgenic plants and non-transgenic coker control plants were probed with anti-nad <dig> antibodies and alex fluor 568®-labelled secondary antibodies to examine the subcellular location of the expressed nad <dig>  nad <dig> was present in the vacuoles of mesophyll cells from line d <dig>  but was confined to the periphery of cells in sections from line  <dig> . <dig> . the antibody did not bind to the leaf sections from the non-transgenic control plants .

examination of subcellular targeting of the gfp chimeras
in order to assess whether the ctpp from nad <dig> was sufficient to direct an otherwise cytosolic protein to the plant vacuole, constructs encoding green fluorescent protein  linked to the ctpp from nad <dig> or the known c-terminal vacuolar sorting determinant  of napi were expressed transiently in n. benthamiana leaves. micrographs showing the location of the gfp  produced during transient expression of the various constructs in n. benthamiana leaves are presented in figure  <dig>  the middle panels are equivalent sections showing membranes highlighted by the fm5- <dig> dye while the right panels are an overlay of the two images. spectral analysis of emitted fluorescence was used to confirm the specificity of the signals for gfp and the fm5- <dig> dye  <cit> .

gfp was located in the vacuole of cells expressing sp-gfp-ctppnad <dig> . in these cells, the junction between the vacuole and the cytoplasm was highlighted by fm5- <dig> dye which stained both the plasma membrane and the tonoplast. a similar result was obtained with the positive control sp-gfp-vsdnapi construct . in cells expressing the gfp construct with an er signal peptide  but no ctpp or vsd, gfp was located in the extracellular space, with fluorescence concentrated around the periphery of the cell . this contrasted with the gfp construct lacking both the er signal  and ctpp/vsd sequences where the expressed gfp was present in the cytoplasm, which was outlined by the fluorescently labelled plasma and tonoplast membranes .

structure of the nad <dig> ctpp
circular dichroism  and nmr spectroscopy were conducted to determine whether a  <dig> amino acid synthetic peptide corresponding to the ctpp from nad <dig> adopts a helical structure as reported for several other c-terminal vacuolar sorting determinants   <cit> . the cd spectra indicated a propensity for helical structure that was stabilised in the presence of trifluoroethanol , as shown in figure 7a. the nmr data were consistent with this interpretation and analysis of the secondary shifts, shown in figure 7b, indicated that residues 10– <dig> form a helix in solution. the secondary shifts for these residues became more negative on addition of tfe, again indicating that the helical structure was stabilised in the presence of tfe .

discussion
we have discovered that the class ii defensin, nad <dig>  can be phytotoxic in transgenic cotton plants when expressed without its  <dig> amino acid ctpp. this phytotoxicity was manifested in the leaves of transgenic plants as distortions in the cellular architecture that presented as a wrinkly phenotype at the macroscopic level. the plants were stunted and had short internodes, but more critically, were often infertile or produced small bolls with reduced seed number. the phytotoxicity was most obvious in plants that had accumulated about 7 ppm nad <dig> in their leaves and was not detectable at nad <dig> levels of about 1 ppm or less. the phenotype segregated with nad <dig> in the t <dig> generation, demonstrating that it had been caused by expression of nad <dig> and was not an artefact that had been introduced during tissue culture. this is supported by the observation that  <dig> out of the  <dig> primary transformants produced with the sp-nad1Δctpp construct had an abnormal phenotype. this is distinguished from the low number of plants  with an unusual phenotype that normally arise from the cotton embryogenesis regeneration method used to produce the transgenic cotton . this effect was most likely responsible for the  <dig> plants out of  <dig> primary transformants  with the sp-nad1-ctpp construct that were either infertile and/or exhibited distorted or small leaves. thus, phytotoxicity was not evident in plants when nad <dig> was expressed with its cognate ctpp.

line d <dig> plants have been assessed in greenhouse bioassays for resistance to fusarium oxysporum f. sp. vasinfectum  and subsequently in field trials over three growing seasons in fields naturally infested with fov and in two growing seasons in fields naturally infested with v. dahliae. in both fov or v. dahliae infested soils, line d <dig> plants had higher survival rates, greater tolerance to the pathogens and 2- to 4-fold increases in lint yield compared to the non-transgenic control plants  <cit> . line d <dig> plants typically accumulated about 3–6 ppm nad <dig> in their older leaves and did not exhibit any detrimental agronomic features such as short internodes, decreased height or fertility relative to the non-transgenic parent. additionally, when the plants were grown in non-diseased soil there was no yield penalty or difference in lint quality when compared to the non-transgenic control plants  <cit> .

almost  <dig> unique plant defensins have been transformed into more than  <dig> different plant species ranging from arabidopsis to monocot and dicot crop species in an attempt to enhance resistance to a variety of fungal diseases  <cit> . given the number of plant defensins tested, the number of crop species transformed and reports of enhanced disease resistance, it is interesting that none have been developed into a commercial trait. one of the most promising reports was from gao and co-workers  <cit>  who demonstrated that constitutive expression of the class i defensin alfafp in potatoes conferred enhanced resistance to verticillium dahliae. this enhanced resistance was maintained in the laboratory and under field conditions over several years at different geographical sites. much later they reported that plants expressing alfafp had smaller tubers  <cit> .

to date, the majority of these studies have used class i defensins. in reports where it was explicitly stated, the plants had no obvious deleterious effects from defensin expression. however yield was not reported in any of the glasshouse or field trials and thus, the effects of constitutive expression of class i plant defensins have not been fully evaluated. as reported here, removal of the ctpp from the class ii defensin nad <dig> to make it more like a class i defensin resulted in abnormal morphology and loss of fecundity. likewise, ghag and co-workers have recently demonstrated that the class ii petunia defensins  <cit>  are not toxic when expressed in bananas but become phytotoxic when expressed without their cognate ctpps  <cit> . transformation experiments using these defensins without their ctpp produced significantly fewer embryos and these did not develop into mature transgenic banana plants  <cit> .

it is interesting to contemplate why class i defensins are not phytotoxic to their own host plants when they are naturally expressed without a ctpp. either they do not accumulate to the same high levels as the class ii defensins or they have a different mechanism of action. examination of the three-dimensional structures of the mature domains of various defensins does not indicate any obvious differences between those of class i or class ii defensins  <cit> . they all adopt comparable and superimposable folds centred on the cysteine-stabilized αβ motif comprising an α-helix and a triple stranded antiparallel β-sheet that is stabilized by a network of four disulfide bonds  <cit> .

however, although the three-dimensional structure is conserved, the amino acid sequence of plant defensins is highly variable apart from the eight highly conserved cysteine residues, serine  <dig>  an aromatic residue at position  <dig>  glycine  <dig> and glutamates at position  <dig> and  <dig>   <cit> . this has led to the hypothesis that defensins have a conserved scaffold that presents surface loops that are highly variable in sequence and that this variability accounts for the diverse range of biological activities that have been ascribed to defensins  <cit> . nad <dig> and other class ii defensins from the solanaceae are thus likely to have a different mechanism of antifungal activity to antifungal class i defensins  <cit> . nad <dig>  for example, interacts with a specific target on the fungal cell wall before it accesses and permeabilises the plasma membrane and enters the cytoplasm where it may interact with a specific target in the cytoplasm and initiate cell death  <cit> . psd <dig>  the class i defensin from peas, also enters the fungal cell and travels to the nucleus where it inhibits cell cycle  <cit> . in contrast, the class i defensins from radish , dahlia  and alfalfa  do not enter the cell but interact with specific sphingolipids in the plasma membrane and cell wall leading to membrane disruption and cell death  <cit> . in another mechanism, plant defensins such as msdef <dig> and zmes <dig> have been reported to interact with ion channels  <cit> .

we have previously suggested that the difference in net charge between the mature defensin domain and the ctpp of class ii defensins may have evolved as a strategy to prevent deleterious effects on the host cell by making the defensin less reactive   <cit> . this could reduce the likelihood of defensin aggregation or undesirable interactions with other proteins and membranes in the cell during folding and transport through the endomembrane system. in effect, the ctpp could act as an intramolecular chaperone and impart transport competency to the prodefensin.

it is likely that part of the cytoprotective function that is mediated by the ctpp in nad <dig>  is inextricably linked to its vacuolar targeting function. in this paper, we showed by two approaches that the ctpp of nad <dig> is necessary and sufficient for vacuolar targeting. immunofluorescence microscopy on the stably transformed cotton plants revealed a different location for nad <dig> expressed with or without its ctpp. when the ctpp was present, nad <dig> was targeted to the vacuole and when it was absent, nad <dig> was directed to the periphery of the cell. this is consistent with the observations for the well-characterised class i defensins such as rsafp <dig> from radish and msdef <dig> from alfalfa, which have an extracellular location  <cit> . the observation that the nad <dig> ctpp can direct cytosolic gfp to the vacuoles of n. benthamiana plants in transient expression studies demonstrates its sufficiency as a vacuolar sorting determinant.

the sequence of the ctpps from nad <dig> and other class ii plant defensins  were compared to other well characterised vacuolar sorting determinants  from other plant proteins . the defensin ctpps are longer, that is, about  <dig> amino acids in length compared to  <dig> amino acids for the c-terminal vsd of barley lectin  <cit>  or seven for tobacco chitinase  <cit> . furthermore, while no consensus motif has been identified for c-terminal vsds, they are all enriched in hydrophobic and acidic amino acids . the first half of the nad <dig> ctpp also shares two tetrapeptide motifs with the barley lectin vsd; vfde and ilae in the nad <dig> ctpp and the motifs vfae and lvae in the barley lectin vsd . others have reported that as few as three or four amino acids can function as vacuolar sorting signals in plants  <cit> , including the vfae or lvae motifs of barley lectin  <cit> . the defensin ctpps may be longer than normal vacuolar sorting motifs because of their dual function in targeting and detoxification.

we demonstrated that the nad <dig> ctpp forms a helical structure in solution like other c-terminal vsds  <cit> . from a structural context, it would be interesting to examine the presentation of the ctpp with respect to the mature nad <dig> defensin domain. such information could provide details of possible contacts that could be mediated between the two domains and may form the molecular basis for the protein folding and/or detoxification hypothesis. alternatively, such information could provide clues as to whether the ctpp is indeed helical in the context of pronad <dig> and whether it’s helical structure is important for its vacuolar targeting function as has been proposed for the napi c-terminal vsd  <cit> . nielsen et al.  <cit>  suggested that the α-helical structure of the napi vsd may be a necessary requirement for the sorting signal to be relatively exposed to interact with the sorting receptor. indeed, when the slightly curved amphipathic α-helical structure of the napi vsd was combined by molecular modelling with the structure of one of the adjoining proteinase inhibitor  domains, the vsd seems to protrude from an otherwise compact pi domain  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the class ii defensin nad <dig> is phytotoxic in transgenic cotton plants when expressed without its ctpp. these plants had distortions in their cellular architecture that presented as a wrinkly leaf phenotype, were typically stunted and often infertile or produced small bolls with reduced seed number. we demonstrated by two approaches that the ctpp of nad <dig> is necessary and sufficient for vacuolar targeting and when the ctpp was absent, nad <dig> was directed to the periphery of the cell. thus the ctpp plays an important role in targeting and detoxification of the defensin as it moves through the plant secretory pathway. the ctpp is crucial for the transgenic expression of class ii defensins to avoid a yield penalty from phytotoxic side-effects.
