BACKGROUND
alternative splicing  is a ubiquitous phenomenon occurring across all eukaryotic organisms as many biological processes are regulated through this type of post-transcriptional process, leading to the production of more than one coding or noncoding transcript from a single locus . several types of as events occur during precursor mrna  splicing, including exon skipping, intron retention, and/or the use of alternative acceptor and donor splice sites, producing transcripts with premature stop codons and altered coding potential  <cit> . as provides a basis for protein diversity by generating proteins with distinct amino acid sequences, leading to altered numbers and types of functional domains, protein modification sites, or truncated proteins with different biological functions . because many of these protein isoforms are membrane bound, not abundant, and often too short to be captured by proteomics approaches , alternative approaches are needed to assess the influence of as on protein diversity.

pre-mrna splicing involves over  <dig> regulatory spliceosomal components, including small ribonucleoproteins, specific splicing factors , and other proteins, collectively referred to as splicing-related proteins   <cit> . srps are involved in protein-rna  such as sfs) and/or protein-protein interactions within a spliceosome. the final splicing outcome is the result of the action of several srps. the specificity of splicing is brought about through the action of sfs, which bind to their target pre-mrnas in a position-dependent and rna-motif-specific manner, acting as exonic or intronic splicing enhancers or silencers  <cit> . the position of splicing regulatory elements determines the action of the cognate sf because they affect the representation or misrepresentation of the splice site to the sf, which ultimately results in inclusion or exclusion of the corresponding rna sequence in the final transcript  <cit> . this being the case, the production of spliced transcripts is dependent, in part, on the presence and activity of each sf required for the splicing of its corresponding pre-mrnas. coordination exists between the expression of an sf and the transcripts produced by that sf. coordinated splicing  is defined here as the action of the spliceosome on a group of pre-mrnas to produce a population of coordinately expressed and spliced transcripts.

extensive protein-rna binding information based on photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation   <cit>  and clip-seq-based  <cit>  experiments is only available in animals. in human and mouse, several computational tools have been developed to integrate protein-rna binding data with splicing patterns to define the splicing code  <cit> , including tissue-specific splicing code  <cit> , and to infer co-splicing networks for specific regulatory sfs . computational pipelines have been implemented to identify conserved rna-binding motifs for individual rbps using these types of data  <cit> . since direct protein-rna binding data is lacking for other organisms  <cit> , computational tools are needed that can systematically identify putative sfs, predict rna-binding sites for the corresponding pre-mrna targets of sfs of interest, and infer global networks of co-spliced product transcripts.

here, we introduce cosplicenet, an integrated computational framework for unraveling co-splicing regulation on a global scale using rna sequencing  data and de novo predictions of sf rna-binding sites. the cosplicenet framework was applied to existing temporal and organ-specific co-expression data obtained from developing arabidopsis thaliana embryos  <cit>  to infer a co-splicing network for  <dig> selected rbps that are differentially expressed during embryo development. the tool can be easily applied to any temporal or other rna-seq or splicing microarray datasets obtained from any eukaryotic organism to infer predictive co-splicing networks.

RESULTS
as and protein diversity in arabidopsis embryo development
in order to characterize the effect of as on protein diversity, first, genes encoding pre-mrnas that were alternatively spliced were identified. five thousand six hundred two genes were identified that were alternatively spliced from the total population of  <dig>  detected transcripts. these genes encoded at least one non-canonical sv  each, which was compared in each case with the canonical sv for protein diversity analysis. assessment of differences in coding potentials, peptide ratios, pairwise global alignment scores, and functional domain compositions were carried out . among these  <dig> sv pairs, only  <dig> genes produced both a coding and a noncoding sv. in cases when a sv was predicted to be noncoding, the corresponding “peptide length” ratio was found to be  <dig>  on average  as non-coding rnas typically contain short open reading frames  <cit> .table  <dig> terminology and the corresponding definitions used in this manuscript.

our results revealed that as may result in the production of protein isoforms with identical, disparate, or truncated domains. among the  <dig> sv pairs, about 40 %  of inferred protein isoforms contained identical domains, indicating that as affected amino acid sequences other than those in the conserved domains. approximately 23 % of protein isoforms  were missing a domain completely . about  <dig>  %  of the protein isoforms had truncated domains, suggesting that as partially affected functional domains as opposed to removing them altogether . the majority of protein isoforms originating from transcripts with similar coding potentials had either identical or similar domains . comparing conserved domain differences with the population of protein isoform lengths revealed that short protein isoforms had either truncated domains or had lost a domain completely . therefore, as events that result in the production of a protein isoform that is approximately 30 % shorter than the canonical protein isoform have a higher probability of causing loss or truncation of the functional domains .

because a main focus on this manuscript is on the differentially expressed transcripts, we performed protein diversity analysis on them as well. two thousand three hundred forty-five genes were identified that were alternatively spliced. each non-canonical sv was compared with its corresponding canonical sv, leading to the identification of  <dig> sv pairs . these  <dig> sv pairs were subjected to protein diversity analysis. the differentially expressed transcripts follow the same distributions as the whole population of detected transcripts in the protein diversity categories .

characterization of differentially expressed transcripts in developing arabidopsis embryos
identification of the set of transcripts whose expression changed significantly in developing arabidopsis embryos is of central importance for understanding any time and/or developmentally dependent relationships that may exist between the action of specific sfs and their targets. therefore, further analysis for co-splicing network inference was performed on this specific set of differentially expressed transcripts. the population of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts was categorized into coding or noncoding based on codewise  <cit>  predictions and genic or intergenic, sense or antisense, coding or non-coding as defined in the “tuxedo suite” package  <cit>  . most differentially expressed transcripts were known, or predicted, to be coding, with only  <dig> differentially expressed ncrnas detected in the developing arabidopsis embryo dataset .table  <dig> categorization of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts into cuffcompare classes. differentially expressed transcripts in developing arabidopsis embryos belong to different classes  and can be coding or noncoding based on codewise predictions.




co-expression network analysis
to identify trends among  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts, k-means clustering was performed to obtain  <dig> clusters . grouping of clusters containing transcripts that were expressed at the same developmental phase yielded six super-clusters, containing six combinations of the three embryo maturation phases defined above . these super-clusters comprised transcripts expressed at:  early maturation,  early and middle maturation,  middle maturation,  middle maturation and early desiccation,  early desiccation, and  both early maturation and desiccation phases. grouping transcripts into color-coded super-clusters facilitated visualization of co-expression and co-splicing networks from the temporal perspective of embryo development. although some transcripts were expressed only at one developmental phase, the expression of the majority of differentially expressed transcripts  spanned two or more developmental phases .fig.  <dig> classification of transcripts into super-clusters. the set of  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts were grouped into  <dig> clusters using k-means clustering. clusters were further merged into  <dig> super-clusters based on the extent of transcript expression rather than the actual expression profiles during the three major developmental phases in arabidopsis seed maturation . the colors assigned to each super-cluster were used to visualize the nodes  in all networks within this manuscript to obtain temporal information on transcript expression in developing arabidopsis embryos.




the set of  <dig> significantly differentially expressed transcripts contained  <dig> srps. these srps were distributed across the six super-clusters , however, 42 % of srps were expressed during the “early”  and 30 % of srps were expressed during “early maturation and desiccation” phases of embryo development  . to identify associations between srps and their potential products, spearman correlation analysis was performed on the set of  <dig> srps and the set of  <dig> remaining differentially expressed transcripts. this analysis led to the identification of  <dig> transcripts whose expression was highly correlated with at least one srp . a list of transcripts  associated with each srp can be found in additional file 6: table s <dig>  the resulting co-expression network is shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> association of differentially expressed transcripts with srps in a co-expression network. spearman correlation analysis was performed between  <dig> srps and  <dig> differentially expressed transcripts. transcripts showing temporal trends that highly correlated with each srp  were extracted  and visualized as a co-expression network in cytoscape. srps are shown as diamonds and transcripts as circles. nodes are color-coded based on super-clusters introduced in fig.  <dig>  the  <dig> rbps are presented.




as shown in this network, some transcripts were co-expressed only with a single srp, forming individual sub-networks . the majority of transcripts, however, co-expressed with more than one srp, resulting in a highly interconnected large sub-network with potential associations among individual srps . although most edges in this network likely reflect transcriptional co-expression, some may reflect co-splicing relationships, or a combination of transcriptional co-expression and co-splicing. to further explore possible specific splicing-related associations between srps and their product transcripts, co-splicing networks were constructed by integration of de novo motif discovery at the splice junctions.

co-splicing network inference by using cosplicenet
because not every srp is involved in pre-mrna-protein interactions and the goal was to identify srps responsible for splicing specificity, the population of  <dig> srps was mined to identify genes encoding sfs and rbps that possess potential rna-binding capabilities based on experimental evidence and/or the presence of at least one single rna-binding domain. this resulted in the identification of  <dig> transcripts encoding rbps with an rna-binding domain . transcripts belonging to the sub-networks of these  <dig> rbps were used for subsequent motif discovery and co-splicing network construction . the transcripts whose expression was positively correlated with any of these  <dig> rbps  were extracted from the large co-expression network . de novo motif discovery was performed using meme  <cit>  as described in methods to identify consensus sequences in the splice junctions, specifically in the 30-nucleotide  r-regions, of co-expressed transcripts with each rbp. r <dig> and r <dig> are within intronic, while r <dig> and r <dig> are within exonic regions of the splice junctions . the transcripts that contained at least one significant motif  at one of their r regions  were retained for the co-splicing network analysis. the motif was then incorporated into the final predictive co-splicing network, such that an edge was formed between the rbp and its predicted products whose pre-mrnas had that motif in the corresponding r region. co-splicing networks were constructed only for rbps to specifically predict connections between proteins capable of interacting with rna and their products at each splice junction.fig.  <dig> co-splicing network construction. the following steps were performed to construct a co-splicing network: first, the sets of transcripts highly correlating with at least one srp  were identified. second, 30-nucleotide regions surrounding each exon/intron splice junction  were extracted for each transcript co-expressing with any of the selected rbps. in this example, transcripts x and y are encoded by genes x and y. third, the resulting sequences were subjected to meme analysis separately for each of the sf groups to find consensus motifs. fourth, transcripts containing significantly enriched motifs at each region  were retrieved from the meme results. fifth, for each transcript that had a significantly enriched motif in at least one of the r regions , the corresponding weighted edges representing the individual r regions were constructed between each sf and its potential product in cytoscape. edges are weighted based on –log .




to construct a co-splicing network related to the population of  <dig> rbps and their potential products, an edge was formed between transcripts co-expressing with any of the  <dig> rbps when at least one conserved rna motif was present in any of the four r regions, as defined above. the resulting co-splicing network contained  <dig> transcripts connected through at least one r-related edge to at least one specific rbp . please note that no significantly enriched motif was found for scl <dig> and, as such, this network contained  <dig> rbps. all r regions that did not have statistically significant motifs compared with background noise  were eliminated from the co-splicing network . a transcript was predicted as a potential target of an sf if the expression of that transcript was highly correlated  with the expression of that sf in developing embryos and a statistically significantly occurring enriched motif existed in at least one of the r-regions .

in order to assess how frequently the motifs occur in exon/intron junctions, the ri ratio was defined . we compared the sequence motifs detected in the r <dig> through r <dig> regions for each group and identified motifs that were specifically enriched in each region. the list of  <dig> rbps and their corresponding significantly enriched motifs in each ri region are available in additional file 11: table s <dig> in the format of motif logos and in text format in additional file 12: table s <dig>  the position weight matrices for these motifs are available in additional file 13: table s <dig>  some motifs were found to be present in multiple co-splicing networks. for example, the aggu motif was enriched in more than half of the r <dig> regions, and the ugcag motif in most of the r <dig> regions. c/u-rich motifs were found in the majority of r <dig> and r <dig> regions with a consensus sequence of cuucuu.

identification of differentially spliced transcripts
the networks presented above are based on transcriptional co-expression and/or co-splicing associations between srps and transcripts that showed expression trends nearly identical to the trends of these srps. the expression profile of a pre-mrna is dependent on the action of specific tfs, but pre-mrnas are transient and usually not captured by rna-seq data as most splicing co-occurs with transcription in the nucleus. the resulting transcripts can either show trends that are similar to those of their corresponding pre-mrna , trends that correspond to the action of a sf , or a combination of the two. one way to computationally distinguish co-splicing from transcription-related co-expression is to identify svs that show different expression profiles. svs are encoded by the same gene and any differences in their expression profiles can be explained by a post-transcriptional event, e.g., differential splicing when distinct sfs bind to their motifs on pre-mrna to facilitate splicing, in our case, sfs expressed at different developmental stages.

differentially spliced transcripts were defined here as svs of a gene encoding a pre-mrna predicted to be spliced by distinct sfs  belonging to different super-clusters. fifty two genes were identified that encode differentially spliced transcripts , having at least one sv connected to one of the  <dig> rbps and at least one other either differentially expressed sv or an sv that showed stable expression during embryo development . the resulting splicing-specific network contained  <dig> rbps and  <dig> transcripts . for example, the toe <dig> gene in this network has one sv  associated with the rbp at5g <dig>  and two other svs  were connected to the rbp at2g <dig> and at4g <dig>  in contrast, fes1a. <dig> and  <dig> co-express with the sf sc <dig> , while the third svs  is only expressed during the seed desiccation phase and is not associated with any of the  <dig> rbps within this sub-network.fig.  <dig> co-splicing sub-networks for differentially expressed and differentially spliced transcripts. this sub-network shows transcripts represented by at least two svs connected with different srps. this analysis separates transcriptional co-expression from co-splicing.




inferred splicing events associated with the upr in the er
er stress occurs in plants under specific conditions  <cit> , one of which may be the intense production of secretory proteins during specific developmental phases. this is manifested as the accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins in the er, called the upr. the role of the upr is to sense er protein-folding activities, signaling the genome to modulate the expression of genes affecting the protein folding machinery. in the co-splicing network presented in fig.  <dig>  the expression of  <dig> transcripts encoded by upr-related genes was found to be correlated with irea1a, rbp-dr <dig>  and at1g <dig> transcripts, each encoding a cytoplasmic rbp .fig.  <dig> co-splicing sub-networks for er-related transcripts. ire1a, atrbp-dr <dig>  and at1g <dig> are rbps involved in er-associated splicing and are expressed during early and middle maturation or middle maturation and desiccation phases of embryo development. associations between these rbps and their predicted products are shown through weighted edges , representing the presence of significantly enriched conserved motifs in the corresponding r regions of these products.




the expression of a previously unknown ire1a sv, an er-resident transmembrane protein which carries out unconventional, extra-nuclear, splicing in the cytosol  <cit> , was found to be significantly correlated with the expression of  <dig> svs . the motif present in r <dig> regions of these  <dig> sv is present in about 50 % of the exons, while r <dig> and r <dig> motifs are present in more than 30 % of the exons-intron junctions . all transcripts whose expression was correlated with that of ire <dig> fell into either the middle maturation or middle maturation and dt super-clusters. the expression of two svs of bzip <dig> tf, encoded by at2g <dig>  correlated with the expression of ire1a, suggesting that bzip <dig> may be a product of ire1a-associated splicing common to both svs. closer examination of bzip <dig> svs and protein isoforms revealed the existence of a conserved ggu motif  located in the r <dig> region of not only the first consensus intron, but also in a small and unconventional  intron. an alternative donor and acceptor splice events within a large exon resulted in the formation of bzip <dig> n <dig> sv, which yielded a truncated protein due to truncation of the bzip domain . bzip <dig> is a membrane-tethered, er-localized tf activated by release from the er membrane  <cit> .fig.  <dig> ire1a co-splicing network a the co-splicing network for ire1a illustrates the presence of consensus motifs in r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> regions of potential pre-mrnas targets. b r ratio distributions for ire1a potential targets. r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> motifs are present in more than  <dig>   <dig>  and 32 % of the target exons.

a search for common putative sf-binding motifs among the  <dig> svs whose expression correlated with that of ire1a revealed commonalities among r <dig>  r <dig>  and r <dig> groups. all detected r motifs were unique to the ire1a group. this result suggests that additional direct targets of ire1a may be present among this population of co-expressed and co-spliced transcripts. however, the expression of bzip <dig>  encoded by at1g <dig>  the most well established target of ire1a for well-studied uprs in seedlings, was not significantly correlated with the expression of ire1a. only the un-spliced form of bzip <dig> was detected in developing arabidopsis embryos, and it was significantly expressed during embryo development at the early maturation phase.

in addition, the expression of  <dig> transcripts encoded by genes associated with the upr that were present in the early and middle maturation super-cluster was highly correlated with the expression of another sf, rbp-dr <dig>  a cytoplasmic protein, encoded by at4g <dig>  which, to date has been associated only with the salicylic acid signaling pathway and responses to pathogens  <cit> , and the regulation of flowering  <cit> . the inferred network for rbp-dr <dig> is available in additional file 17: table s <dig>  among the inferred targets of rbp-dr <dig> that are known to be upr-related were a bip, , sec <dig> , a pre-protein translocase, , two svs of pdi <dig>  , pdi <dig>  , and calnexin  <dig> . bip is known to be a global regulator of the upr  <cit> .

the expression of a third cytoplasmic, relatively unstudied, rbp  was highly correlated with the expression of six upr-related genes , a haem-oxygenase-like protein, and ferric reduction oxidase).

the presence of a motif in transcripts of several co-splicing groups would indicate that a motif is not specific for a particular sf. in order to examine whether motifs in the upr-related co-splicing network involving ire1a, rbp-dr <dig>  and at1g <dig>  are specific or non-specific, the presence of the reported motifs was investigated in the rest of the co-splicing groups using fimo search and the identified motifs were then subjected to the chi-square test. the specificity test revealed that, in all cases, the motif was significantly specific . therefore, the motifs in all er-related co-splicing groups are specific for each splice region.

although the expression of other plant upr-related genes/transcripts  <cit>  was not correlated with the expression of the three sfs discussed above, many upr-related genes were significantly expressed in developing arabidopsis embryos, including  <dig> transcripts that were present in the same super-clusters as the group of transcripts co-expressing with ire1a. in addition,  <dig> other transcripts encoded by upr-related genes were present in the early and middle maturation super-cluster .

discussion
as and protein diversity
as-related diversity at the transcriptome level can result in an increase in protein plasticity in eukaryotes, as evident from proteomics data  <cit> . to address this question, a high-throughput rna-seq transcriptomics data set obtained from developing arabidopsis embryos  <cit>  was used to evaluate the changes in protein diversity caused by alternative splicing. this led to the identification of  <dig> sv pairs encoded by  <dig> genes in developing arabidopsis embryos. subsequent classification of transcripts into coding or noncoding using codewise  <cit>  revealed that the majority of transcripts were predicted as coding and only  <dig>  % of transcripts were noncoding, represented primarily by natural antisense and intergenic noncoding transcripts. sense and antisense, and genic and intergenic long noncoding rnas  act in cis or trans as they can interact with nucleic acids or proteins and regulate gene expression through epigenetic, transcriptional, or post-transcriptional mechanisms .

comparisons of sequences of in silico translated peptides revealed that approximately 24 % of the  <dig> sv pairs had identical protein sequences. the same analysis was performed on the set of differentially expressed transcripts. global pairwise alignment of protein isoforms in the latter population showed that as did not change the open reading frame in the case of 34 % of the sv pairs. in these cases, some codons were removed during the splicing process. approximately 40 % of the sv pairs showed amino-acid differences. although these differences between protein isoforms make them different proteins, by definition, minor sequence differences may not result in a loss or gain of protein function and these peptides might be expected to have similar activities. as at the unusual gyngyn donor and nagnag acceptor splice sites at the exon/intron and intron/exon junctions, respectively, causes an insertion or deletion of three nucleotides without a frame shift in primary transcripts, resulting in a single amino acid change in the resulting proteins in eukaryotic organisms . in some cases, insertion of three nucleotides may result in the introduction of a stop codon within the sequence of the final transcript, contributing to protein diversity  <cit> .

loss, or truncation, of crucial functional domains, on the other hand, provide a potentially major contribution to protein diversity. domain comparisons revealed that about 40 % of the peptide variant pairs detected contained identical functional domains. approximately 23 % of the peptide variants had lost at least one functional domain and only 4 % had truncated domains. the remaining peptide variants did not have any known functional domains. the loss or truncation of at least one domain in 27 % of the peptide variants may affect their function, stability, regulation, and/or ability to interact with molecules. in terms of function-relevant protein diversity associated with as, nearly a third of protein isoform pairs were considered to be diverse.

comparing cosplicenet with other existing methods
emerging studies support the existence of co-splicing in plants  <cit> . pre-mrna splicing is controlled by differentially expressed splicing regulatory proteins that confer splicing specificity in a cell-, development-, and/or growth condition-dependent manner  <cit> . several co-splicing networks have recently been constructed to associate sfs with their target exons and introns and transcripts  <cit> , for example, a bayesian approach was used to generate a regulatory co-splicing network for the human sf nova  <cit> . one of the goals in this rapidly growing field is to develop bioinformatics methods for inferring comprehensive co-splicing networks for a large number of sfs that would be suitable for cases where clip-based data are not available or limited, such as developing arabidopsis thaliana embryos, the model system analyzed here.

we took advantage of an existing rna-seq dataset related to transcriptome changes during embryo development in arabidopsis. to infer co-splicing networks and sub-networks in developing arabidopsis embryos, functional associations between sfs and their products were predicted. this task was achieved by integrating transcript co-expression and splicing regulatory elements for  <dig> differentially expressed rbps as de novo identified conserved multivalent rna-binding motifs, to which sfs within spliceosomes are recruited for splicing.

our method is distinct from other applications, such as rnamotif, in several ways. first, rnamotif combines r <dig> and r <dig> regions, whereas these exonic regions are separated in our method in order to be able to detect distinct rna motifs at the 5′ and 3′ ends of exons. second, we hypothesized that a sf and its potential product may be co-expressed. therefore, the motif search was performed on co-expressing transcripts rather than on the entire population, enabling sf-specific motif and corresponding target transcript predictions. this also allowed the generation of co-splicing networks and sub-networks related to temporal aspects of embryo development in arabidopsis using super-cluster information. considering only differentially expressed sfs resulted in the elimination of sfs that were ubiquitously expressed and regulated at the post-translational levels. however, the goal of the current study was to identify developmentally related rbps and their conserved rna-binding motifs, which is the reason for selecting only differentially expressed rbps. in many cases, the ri ratio, which reflects how frequently a conserved motif was present in a transcript , was less than  <dig> , indicating that the motif was present in less than 40 % of the splice junctions. therefore, some other sfs are likely involved in producing the final svs.

several motifs were specifically enriched in particular r regions. for example, the sr45-binding spliceosomal protein u2af <dig>  <cit>  was differentially expressed, and unique binding motifs were present in the r <dig> and r <dig> regions of the co-splicing group associated with u2af <dig>  motifs in the r <dig> and r <dig> regions unique to the sc <dig> co-splicing group were also identified. sc <dig> is a member of the ser/arg-rich  protein family, which are homologs of the corresponding sr protein family in mammals  <cit> .

er-associated co-splicing sub-networks
the majority of transcripts are spliced in the nucleus concurrently with transcription of pre-mrna. however, some pre-mrnas are transported outside of the nucleus to the cytoplasmic side of the er to get spliced  <cit> . among the  <dig> rbps within the co-splicing network, ire1a, rbp-dr <dig>  and at1g <dig> were found to co-express with a number of transcripts involved in the upr that are involved in maintaining proper protein folding at the er. in addition, several enriched consensus rna-binding motifs were identified on pre-mrnas of these transcripts that may represent the specific binding sites for these three rbps. rbp-dr <dig> and at1g <dig> are cytoplasmic proteins with rna-binding rrm/rbd/rnp motifs with no prior association with the er-associated splicing of upr-related targets  <cit> . while the function of at1g <dig> is unknown, rbp-dr <dig> is involved in promoting a hypersensitive response through positive regulation of salicylic acid signaling during plant-pathogen interactions and inhibition of flowering through mrna decay of suppressor of overexpression of constans  <dig>  a component of flowering signaling pathway  <cit> . based on a highly significant correlation between the expression of these rbps and the expression of several upr-related genes, rbp-dr <dig> and at1g <dig> may be involved in upr.

ire1a is a well-studied, er-localized transmembrane protein, which is documented to engage in unconventional, non-nuclear, splicing of pre-mrnas present in the cytosol through the action of its c-terminal rnase domain facing the cytosol  <cit> . specifically, ire1a is known to splice bzip <dig> pre-mrna, encoding a tf that mediates the activation of some of the genes involved in the upr in plants  <cit> . two branches of the upr are known in plants, one involving the splicing of bzip <dig> and the other facilitating the release of two membrane-bound tfs in the er, bzip <dig> and bzip <dig>  <cit> . expression of two spliced forms of bzip <dig> was correlated closely with the expression of ire1a, suggesting that ire1a is also involved in splicing bzip <dig> pre-mrna. in contrast, only the unspliced form of bzip <dig> was significantly differentially expressed in developing arabidopsis embryos, suggesting that ire1a did not act to splice the corresponding pre-mrna. based on these predictions and observations, the upr in developing embryos may differ from that in seedlings in regard to the aspects related to bzip <dig> and bzip <dig> splicing.

ire1a may have as yet unknown direct targets that modulate ire1a signaling under specific conditions  <cit> . to date, the upr has been studied almost exclusively in leaves and seedlings under different stress conditions. however, the role of ire1a also appears to include effects on vegetative growth and reproductive development  <cit> . upr-like events, called “erqc, er quality control”, can occur within the er during development when high levels of secretory proteins are being synthesized, rather than a response to a classical stress condition  <cit> . this may also occur during the maturation and desiccation phases of arabidopsis seed development when seed storage proteins are made. it should also be noted that, under normal conditions, loss of ire <dig> causes changes in root growth  <cit> , suggesting that this sf is also an essential part of development, in addition to its role in er-related stress responses. based on the transcriptomic data reported here, some form of this process is likely part of embryo development as  <dig> transcripts encoded by genes associated with erqc were differentially expressed in developing arabidopsis embryos, several of which were highly correlated with the expression of one or other of ire1a or rbp-dr <dig>  the splicing actions of ire1a, rbp-dr <dig>  and at1g <dig> are likely to be part of this qc process. with respect to specific rna-binding motifs, the agguaag motif was found in the r <dig> region of the co-splicing group of ire1a-associated transcripts . this motif is similar to the binding motif of the rbp dazap <dig>   <cit>  found in human reproductive tissues that is involved in both oocyte maturation  <cit>  and spermatogenesis  <cit> . the upr system has not previously been associated with the regulation of seed development, nor have specific sfs, nor have specific rna-binding motifs been identified as part of that process. it is interesting to note that the three rbps that showed high correlation with the expression of upr-related transcripts are all cytoplasmic proteins. these observations suggest that the processing of this category of transcripts may have a cytoplasmic component and that non-nuclear splicing may be an essential part of the process of protein synthesis during seed development.

CONCLUSIONS
splicing is a highly regulated combinatorial process involving multiple srps and small nuclear rna molecules interacting within the spliceosome and/or with pre-mrna. cosplicenet has been developed for the inference of co-splicing networks through identification of sfs and their potential targets through joint analysis of co-expression and de novo motif prediction at the splice junctions. pre-mrna secondary and tertiary structures are known to be important for the regulation of splicing also  <cit> . consequently, the integration of rna structure and rna-protein interactomes together with transcriptomic data is needed to obtain a comprehensive view of the regulation of splicing events  <cit> . the co-splicing networks presented here are predictive and intended to serve as a basis from which to begin to unravel this complex phenomenon. these networks facilitated the identification of groups of transcripts that were potential splice products of one or more sf. the pre-mrnas of these candidate splice products possessed unique consensus cis-regulatory elements in at least one of their splice junctions, yielding predictions regarding the associations of sfs with their respective conserved rna-binding motifs.
