BACKGROUND
cotton is the leading natural textile fiber crop in the world. approximately  <dig> % of the world’s arable land is used for cotton planting, generating about $ <dig>  billion in  <dig>  <cit> . cotton belongs to the gossypium genus of malvaceae, which contains five tetraploid species  and approximately  <dig> diploid species   <cit> . upland cotton  is the most widely cultivated species and its production accounts for over 95% of the world’s cotton production  <cit> . during the development of its cultivars, cotton has been subjected to long-term artificial selection, which narrowed its genetic base and gave rise to several difficulties in breeding. cotton breeders face a scarcity of genetically diverse resources, therefore expanding the genetic base of cotton cultivars is imperative. wild or untapped species have many excellent characteristics and contain abundant desirable genes, which have yet to be unlocked by pre-breeding. g. anomalum  which is native to africa, mainly angola and namibia  <cit> , has the favorable characteristics of drought tolerance and resistance to diseases  and insect pests : more importantly, it also possesses genes with the potential to produce high quality fibers   <cit>  and cytoplasmic male sterility . however, it is difficult to transfer these desirable genes into cultivated cotton through conventional breeding methods due to the isolation of wild species from cultivated species, which limits chromosome pairing and genetic recombination.

monosomic alien addition lines  contain only one alien chromosome in addition to the receptor background chromosomes. maals can be used as a bridge to transfer desired genes from wild species into g. hirsutum  <cit> . over the past two decades, maals have been widely available for numerous crops  <cit> , and these can be used for effectively identifying favorable genes in wild species, allowing for more accurate and faster transfer of such genes to create introgression lines, the effect of specific alien chromosomes to be examined, homeologies with chromosomes of cultivated species to be compared  <cit> , and physical maps of specific chromosomes to be constructed  <cit> . in cotton, however, the high number and smaller size of the chromosomes has resulted in difficulties in discriminating chromosomes from wild species in cultivated cotton background, therefore the development of cotton maals has lagged far behind many other crops. no set of cotton maals was reported until cotton molecular genetic maps were constructed and a genomic in situ hybridization  technique for cotton was developed. previously, only one complete set of g. hirsutum-g. australe maals had been developed using simple sequence repeat  markers and gish  <cit> . two g. hirsutum-g. somalense maals and several g. hirsutum-g. sturtianum maals have also been obtained  <cit> .

in this study, the g. hirsutum-g. anomalum hexaploid was used as a maternal parent in the continuous backcrossing with upland cotton , and eleven maals were isolated using gish and ssr markers. these maals may be useful for mining and transferring favorable genes from g. anomalum into g. hirsutum on a genome-wide scale, mapping genes on chromosomes, analyzing genome structure and evolution, and micro-cloning for chromosome-specific library construction.

RESULTS
alien chromosomes from g. anomalum in g. hirsutum were examined by the improved gish
the gish technique used in our previous research was improved as follows. genomic dna extracted from g. anomalum and g. herbaceum was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dutp and bio-16-dutp  by nick translation, respectively. the labeled dna was mixed at a variety of ratios for gish analysis using chromosomes from the mitotic metaphases as target templates. the results indicate that a ratio of 4: <dig> is the most suitable for discrimination of chromosomes from g. anomalum and the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum. at this ratio the chromosomes from g. anomalum only hybridized with the g. anomalum probe to produce a red signal, while chromosomes of the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum cross-hybridized with both the g. anomalum and g. herbaceum probes to produce a white signal and chromosomes of the dt-subgenome of g. hirsutum were stained with 4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  , producing a blue color. therefore, the gish technique has been improved and can be further used to differentiate chromosomes from g. anomalum and the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum .fig.  <dig> genomic in situ hybridization of the putative alien chromosomes of g. anomalum in the g. hirsutum background using two g. herbaceum and g. anomalum probes. genomic dna from g. anomalum and g. herbaceum was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dutp and bio-16-dutp by nick translation, respectively. chromosomes of the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum were cross-hybridized with both the g. anomalum and g. herbaceum probes and produced white signals and chromosomes of the dt-subgenome of g. hirsutum were stained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole  and produced blue signals. chromosomes from g. anomalum were hybridized with g. anomalum probe and produced red signals. a mitotic chromosome spread of the  <dig> chromosomes of g. hirsutum. b mitotic chromosome spread of the  <dig> chromosomes of g. anomalum. c–l mitotic chromosome spread showing the  <dig> g. hirsutum  chromosomes and three , two , and one  individual chromosomes of g. anomalum , respectively. scale bar = 5μm




progenies of the pentaploid of  × g. hirsutum backcrossed with g. hirsutum were subjected to gish to determine the number of alien chromosomes transferred from g. anomalum to g. hirsutum using visible fluorescent hybridization signals. thirty eight individuals of the bc <dig> population were examined by gish analysis . the analysis demonstrated that  <dig>  carried  <dig> to  <dig> alien chromosomes, and  <dig>  carried  <dig> to  <dig> alien chromosomes. only two  individuals carried one chromosome, 6ba and 13ba of g. anomalum, resepctively. one  plant had no alien chromosomes and the final two  plants had  <dig> alien chromosomes from g. anomalum .table  <dig> incidence of alien chromosomes in the bc <dig> to bc2

a total of  <dig> individuals from the bc <dig> generation were further analyzed by gish. the results indicated that  <dig>  individuals had one alien chromosome of g. anomalum and  <dig>  had no alien chromosomes in the g. hirsutum background.  <dig>  and  <dig>  individuals carried two and three alien chromosomes, respectively, and another  <dig>  carried four alien chromosomes. the results demonstrated that most of the bc <dig> individuals carried 0- <dig> alien chromosomes, and only a small number contained multiple alien chromosomes .

screening of a set of putative g. anomalum chromosome-specific ssr primer pairs
during the evolution of gossypium, chromosomal translocations occurred between genomes a <dig>  a <dig>  and b <dig>  while genome d remained relatively stable  <cit> . numerous recent reports also show that translocations occurred between chromosomes in the at-subgenome of the tetraploids  <cit> , while no large structural variation was found in the dt-subgenome. therefore, we only selected ssr primers from the dt -subgenome of the tetraploid cotton linkage map to screen putative g. anomalum chromosome-specific ssr primer pairs. of the  <dig> pairs of primers we selected,  <dig> amplified distinct fragments in g. hirsutum and g. anomalum, including  <dig> dominant markers of g. hirsutum,  <dig> dominant markers of g. anomalum and  <dig> codominant markers, while  <dig> pairs produced no amplified polymorphic bands and another  <dig> pairs produced vague bands, which were excluded from further study. then, based on the tetraploid cotton linkage map constructed by our institute  <cit> , the above  <dig> codominant markers were located, and of these,  <dig> well-amplified and evenly distributed codominant markers within an interval of  <dig> cm were finally selected for use in genotyping the entire bc1f <dig> and bc2f <dig> population. the  <dig> codominant markers were distributed on the dt-subgenome chromosomes, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> markers per chromosome, with coverage of  <dig> – <dig>  % and a density of  <dig> – <dig>  cm of each chromosome . the g. anomalum-specific ssr markers could be used to track and identify the alien chromosomes from g. anomalum in g. hirsutum.table  <dig> ssr primers used for screening g. anomalum chromosomes in the alien addition lines

one hundred seventy g. hirsutum- and g. anomalum-specific codominant markers distributed on  <dig> dt-subgenome chromosomes of the tetraploids were used to identify the alien chromosomes in  <dig> maals and multiple alien addition lines. the results demonstrated that  <dig>  maal individuals were maal-10ba , followed by  <dig>  maal-4ba,  <dig>  maal-6ba,  <dig>  maal-13ba,  <dig>  maal-2ba,  <dig>  maal-12ba,  <dig>  maal-7ba,  <dig>  maal-11ba,  <dig>  maal-3ba, and  <dig>  maal-9ba . two maals were not found, maal-1ba and maal-5ba; therefore chrs. 1ba and 5ba were not isolated and remained as multiple addition lines.fig.  <dig> genomic in situ hybridization of the putative monosomic alien chromosomes of g. anomalum in the g. hirsutum background using g. herbaceum and g. anomalum probes. a mitotic chromosome spread of the  <dig> chromosomes of g. hirsutum, showing  <dig> chromosomes each of the at-  and dt-  subgenomes. b-l mitotic chromosome spread showing the  <dig> g. hirsutum  chromosomes and different individual chromosomes from g. anomalum , corresponding to 2ba to 4ga  and 6ga to 13ga , respectively. scale bar = 5μm

during the development of maals, chr. 10ba appeared most frequently, with an incidence of  <dig>  %, followed by  <dig>  % for 4ba,  <dig>  % for 6ba, and  <dig>  % for 12ba. chrs. 5ba and 9ba showed very low incidences of  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %.

morphological traits of maals
morphological data were gathered during the cotton growing stage. the results shown in tables  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> indicate that the eleven maals differed from one another and also differed from their parents in terms of their morphological traits, such as plant type, leaf shape, size of flower and boll . most of these maals grew slower than the recipient, tm- <dig>  we found that maal-8ba leaves had a very dark green color. we also observed that maal-7ba, maal-12ba and maal-13ba had relatively bigger leaves, while maal-8ba, maal-9ba and maal-10ba had relatively smaller leaves than the other lines . in addition, maal-6ba, maal-10ba, maal-11ba and maal-12ba had relatively larger flowers than the others. only maal-7ba showed petal spots and maal-6ba had very light brown fibers, indicating that genes for petal spots and light brown fibers are located on chromosomes 7ba and 6ba , respectively. maal-2ba and maal-12ba had relatively longer bolls and maal-7ba had the widest boll diameter, while maal-8ba had the shortest bolls and maal-10ba had the smallest boll diameter . maal-6ba, maal-7ba and maal-9ba had a relatively larger boll weight, while maal-8ba, maal-10ba and maal-11ba had a relatively smaller boll weight than the others . we found that maal-7ba had longer fibers than the others table  <dig> morphological characteristics of the eleven maals

discussion
maals are powerful tools in crop breeding since they can be used to produce alien translocation and substitution lines, to study interspecific relationships, and to construct single chromosome libraries. they can also be used in gene mining, gene assignment, gene expression pattern analysis, gene function analysis, physical gene mapping, isolation of chromosome-specific probes, selective isolation and mapping of cdna/gene of a particular chromosome. numerous reports have shown that the development of maals has been successfully achieved in many crops such as wheat , rice  <cit>  tomato  <cit> , potato  <cit> , cucumber  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , oat  <cit> , sugar beet  <cit> , and rapeseed  <cit> . maals have played and are playing important roles in numerous types of plant genomic research. the development of maals in gossypium began as early as the 1980s but greatly lagged behind other crops due to the large number  and small size of chromosomes, which led to difficulty in accurately discriminating each chromosome, therefore, little progress has been made in cotton. so far only one set of maals has been completed  <cit> , and this work benefited from advances in the development of gish and molecular markers in cotton.

however, in this study, due to the very close relationship between chromosomes of the at-subgenome in g. hirsutum and those in g. anomalum often leading to cross-hybridization in gish, we had to first improve the gish technique by adjusting the ratio of the two different probes used. we tried five different combinations and found that the ratio of 4: <dig> was more suitable than any others for the discrimination of chromosomes from g. anomalum and the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum. therefore, using a combination of the improved gish methodology, g. anomalum chromosome-specific ssr molecular markers and conventional morphological survey, eleven maals were isolated and characterized, and two remain to be isolated from multiple addition states by further backcrossing.

several previous reports showed that g. anomalum contains the favorable characteristics of drought tolerance and resistance to diseases  and insect pests ; and more importantly, it also possesses genes with the potential to produce high quality fibers   <cit>  and cytoplasmic male sterility . our previous reports also demonstrated that using g. anomalum as a donor parent and g. hirsutum as a recipient parent, a series of introgression lines with longer, stronger and finer fibers has been developed  <cit> . shen et al.  <cit>  mapped qtls on chr.  <dig> affecting fiber length in an f <dig> population derived from g. anomalum introgression line  <dig> crossed with tm- <dig>  however, in this study, we investigated some agronomic traits of maals and observed that most maals had poor performances in fiber quality or fiber yield components, implying that the added alien chromosomes had negative effects on most agronomic traits . for example, the bolls of all maals were lighter than those of the recipient tm-1; and the fibers of all six maals were shorter than tm- <dig> . the resultant phenomena may be caused by linkage drag, which means that there were very close linkages between favorable and unfavorable genes on the same chromosome, even though the fibers of some maals were found to be stronger than those of tm- <dig>  therefore, to enhance the transfer of desirable genes and eliminate undesirable genes from g. anomalum, it is necessary to break the linkage drags to promote chromosome recombination between g. hirsutum and g. anomalum. the development of chromosome translocation lines or introgression lines may be an alternative choice based on the maals. we deeply believe that these maals of g. hirsutum-g. anomalum would be a powerful tool for systematically transferring desirable genes chromosome by chromosome from g. anomalum into g. hirsutum, as well as for gene mining, gene assignment, gene function analysis, gene physical mapping, isolation of chromosome-specific probes, selective isolation and mapping of cdnas for a particular chromosome, and genomic research.table  <dig> fiber quality traits from some maals measured by hvi

CONCLUSIONS
from this study, we draw two conclusions.  the gish technique used in our previous research has been improved by using a mixture of two probes at a ratio of 4: <dig>  to avoid cross-hybridization caused by the very close relationship between chromosomes from g. anomalum and the at-subgenome of g. hirsutum, which can be suitable for recognizing alien chromosomes of g. anomalum in g. hirsutum background.  eleven out of  <dig> potential maals were isolated, which would be used, at the chromosome level, for effectively identifying favorable genes in g. anomalum, allowing for more accurate and faster transfer of such genes to create introgression lines, the effect of specific alien chromosomes to be examined, homeologies with chromosomes of cultivated species to be compared, and physical maps of specific chromosomes to be constructed.
