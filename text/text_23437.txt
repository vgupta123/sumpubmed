BACKGROUND
periodontal disease is a bacterially induced and highly common chronic inflammatory condition in humans, and severe periodontal disease  remains the major cause of tooth loss in adult population worldwide  <cit> . dysregulated host response to pathogenic plaque biofilm critically contributes to destructive inflammation resulting in tissue damage and alveolar bone loss  <cit> . porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periodontal pathogen in the mixed microbial community and it releases copious amount of lipopolysaccharide  which perpetually interacts with host cells, thereby significantly contributing to periodontal pathogenesis  <cit> .

lps is a potent immuno-inflammatory modulator which causes serious complications in host. it is comprised of three major components viz. outermost o-antigen, core oligosaccharide regions and innermost lipid a  <cit> . lipid a is the biologically most active component of lps that imparts the endotoxin activity. its structure differs widely among gram-negative bacteria species depending on the differences in composition of attached fatty acids, number of phosphorylation sites and substituted groups attached to the phosphate residues  <cit> . the canonical lipid a structure in escherichia coli lps is a hexa-acylated diphosphorylated glucosamine disaccharide. previous studies have shown that p. gingivalis possesses highly heterogeneous lipid a structures containing penta-acylated lps <dig> and tetra-acylated lps1435/ <dig>  and this structural discrepancy may critically account for contrasting biological activities induced by p. gingivalis lps  <cit> .

human gingival fibroblasts  are the major cell type in human gingiva  <cit> . they play a key role in maintenance and remodeling of extra cellular matrix  by producing various structural components, such as collagen, elastin, glycoprotein and glycosaminoglycans. in addition, hgfs also synthesize and secrete various members of matrix metalloproteinases  in response to p. gingivalis lps challenge, which ultimately contribute to periodontal tissue destruction  <cit> . mmps are a family of structurally and functionally related proteolytic enzymes containing a zinc-binding catalytic domain and they are active against the components of ecm  <cit> . the activity of mmps is largely regulated by several naturally occurring inhibitors like tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases   <cit> . overall, there is a remarkable balance between mmps and timps in periodontal connective tissues and disturbance of this balance is therefore critically implicated in the destruction of periodontal tissues  <cit> . in normal conditions, mmps are involved in the remodeling and turnover of periodontal tissues under the strict control of timps, which bind specifically to the active site of the enzyme thereby maintaining the equilibrium between degradation and regeneration of ecm  <cit> . increased production of mmps 1– <dig> is observed in chronic inflammatory condition such as periodontitis that results in excessive connective tissue breakdown  <cit> . mmps such as mmp- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> are synthesized in periodontal tissues in response to periodontopathic bacteria like p. gingivalis. previous studies have suggested that lps could regulate the mmp expression in various host cell types including hgfs  <cit> .

currently, there are no studies on the role of p. gingivalis lps lipid a heterogeneity with respect to expression of mmps in hgfs. the present study therefore aimed to investigate the expression and regulation of mmps 1– <dig> and timp- <dig> in hgfs in response to the different isoforms of p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and p. gingivalis lps <dig> as well as e. coli lps as a reference. this study sheds light on the regulation of mmp expression and underlying signal transduction pathways in hgfs in response to heterogeneous p. gingivalis lps, which could have important implications in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

RESULTS
heterogeneous p. gingivalis lps lipid a structures differentially modulate mmps 1– <dig> and timp- <dig> mrnas
the dose-dependent experiments showed that both p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig> differentially modulated the expression of mmp- <dig> transcript. the latter  markedly upregulated the expression of mmp- <dig> mrna while the former did not affect the expression . similarly, e. coli lps  significantly upregulated mmp- <dig> expression. both isoforms of p. gingivalis lps upregulated to different extent the expression of mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> mrnas, while e. coli lps significantly upregulated the expression of these transcripts . timp- <dig> mrna expression was significantly induced in p. gingivalis lps1435/1449- and e. coli lps-treated cells, and no significant induction was observed following p. gingivalis lps <dig> stimulation .

notably, mmp- <dig> transcript was differentially expressed in the cells treated by the two isoforms of p. gingivalis lps. p. gingivalis lps <dig> significantly upregulated mmp- <dig> mrna expression at  <dig> and 48 h, while e. coli lps showed prompt expression at 12 h . mmp- <dig> mrna was significantly upregulated by both p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig> at 48 h , and mmp- <dig> transcript was significantly upregulated by p. gingivalis lps <dig> . e. coli lps significantly upregulated both mmp- <dig> and mmp- <dig> mrna expression. timp- <dig> transcript was differently modulated by p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig>  the former significantly upregulated its expression at  <dig> and 48 h, so did e. coli lps at 48 h.

p. gingivalis lps <dig> significantly upregulates mmp- <dig> protein expression
both dose- and time-dependent experiments showed that mmp- <dig> protein was differentially modulated by p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig> in consistent with its transcript expression profile . p. gingivalis lps <dig> at 1 μg/ml and 10 μg/ml significantly upregulated mmp- <dig> protein expression in a time-dependent manner  . the mmp- <dig> level detected in the culture supernatant was greatly higher than that in the cellular fraction . similar observations occurred in e. coli lps-treated cells. moreover, the mmp- <dig> level induced by p. gingivalis lps <dig> was significantly greater than that stimulated by p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> .

next, western blot analysis confirmed that mmp- <dig> protein markedly increased in p. gingivalis lps1690- and e. coli lps-treated cells at 48 h, while p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> did not induce mmp- <dig> at a notable level .

the mmp- <dig> protein expression is not significantly affected by p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps
basal expression of mmp- <dig> was observed at 24 h, and increased at 48 h . with reference to the control, p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps did not significantly affect the expression levels of mmp- <dig> proteins . gelatin zymograms revealed that the mmp- <dig> presented in two forms including pro-mmp- <dig>  and active-mmp- <dig> . in both culture supernatant  and cellular fraction , the activity of mmp- <dig> at  <dig> and 48 h was not significantly affected by p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps.

p. gingivalis lps <dig> induces mmp- <dig> expression via mapk signaling pathway
blocking assays were performed to elucidate the involvements of nf-ĸb and mapk signaling pathways of p. gingivalis lps <dig> induced mmp- <dig> expression in hgfs. both erk inhibitor  and p <dig> mapk inhibitor  significantly suppressed the expression levels of mmp- <dig> transcript  and protein  in p. gingivalis lps1690- and e. coli lps-treated cells. notably, u <dig> inhibited mmp- <dig> expression to a greater extent with reference to sb <dig>  the expression of mmp- <dig> was not significantly reduced by ikk- <dig> inhibitor iv in p. gingivalis lps1690-treated cells, whereas it significantly suppressed mmp- <dig> in e. coli lps-treated cells .

discussion
periodontal disease is a complex inflammatory disease initiated by pathogenic plaque biofilms and results in destruction of tooth-supporting tissues and alveolar bone  <cit> . proteolytic enzymes like mmps play a major role in the degradation of collagens in periodontal tissues. the expression and regulation of mmps and timps in hgfs are therefore crucial for maintenance of tissue homeostasis and periodontal health. although many studies have been performed to elucidate the mechanisms involved in the synthesis and regulation of mmps in periodontal research, no studies are available on the effect of p. gingivalis lps structural heterogeneity on the expression of mmps and the underlying regulatory mechanisms.

mmp- <dig> is known as stromelysin which has both elastinolytic and collagenolytic activities that degrade basement membrane components such as laminin, elastin fibronectin as well as collagen types ii, iii, iv, v, ix, x and xi  <cit> . its level could significantly increase following the stimuli of pro-inflammatory cytokines, growth factors and lps  <cit> . it has been shown that hgfs could upregulate the expression of mmp- <dig> due to the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as il-1β and tnf-α  <cit> . the current study showed that the expression of mmp- <dig> mrna and protein was markedly upregulated by p. gingivalis lps <dig>  whereas no induction was observed in cells treated with p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig>  indicating that the heterogeneous lipid a structures of p. gingivalis lps may differentially modulate the expression of mmp- <dig> in hgfs. moreover, timp- <dig> expression was differently modulated by the two isoforms of p. gingivalis lps as well. it functions as an inhibitor of mmps by forming non-covalent complexes with mmps. it has recently been shown that mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> variants may significantly contribute to chronic periodontitis and disease progression  <cit> . the imbalance between mmps and timps has been implicated in periodontal tissue destruction  <cit> .

p. gingivalis has long been recognized as a major periodontopathogen  <cit> . recently, it is regarded as a keystone pathogen due to its ability to significantly influence the oral microbial community by modulating the innate host response  <cit> . moreover, this bacterium adopts multiple pathogenic mechanisms to evade or subvert the host immune system  <cit> . notably, p. gingivalis lps exhibits significant structural heterogeneity with both isoforms of lps1435/ <dig> and lps <dig>  and our recent studies show that they differentially affect the innate host defense and underlying signaling pathways, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of periodontal disease  <cit> . the current observation that the different isoforms of p. gingivalis lps modulate the expression of mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig> may represent an additional pathogenic mechanism adopted by this noxious species to disturb the physiological tissue remodeling and tissue homeostasis, leading to the initiation of periodontal disease.

p. gingivalis and its virulence attributes such as lps can stimulate various cells types to secrete mmps including mmp- <dig>  <cit> . on the contrary, some studies have suggested that p. gingivalis lps may not induce mmps such as mmp- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig>  <cit> . a study performed on gingival epithelial cells using p. gingivalis lps and e. coli lps showed that neither lps nor il-1β induced mmp- <dig> or mmp- <dig>  <cit> . studies on tissue models such as synovial membranes dissected from rat knee joints showed induction of mmp- <dig>  - <dig> and − <dig> mrna levels but not mmp- <dig> in response to lps stimulation  <cit> . however, foregoing studies have not considered the heterogeneous nature of bacterial lps lipid a structures. therefore, the conflicting findings of the previous studies could to some extent be due to different isoforms of p. gingivalis lps as demonstrated in the present study.

in the present study, e. coli lps-treated hgfs exhibited rapid and significant induction of mmps  <dig> and  <dig> mrnas with reference to the cells treated with p. gingivalis lps <dig>  one possibility for this observation may be the higher responsiveness of hgfs to hexa-acylated nature of the e. coli lps as compared to the penta-acylated structure of p. gingivalis lps <dig>  this notion is consistent with previous findings that e. coli lps is a potent inducer of the production of mmps in fibroblast-like synovial cells and rat chondrocytes, as well as other innate host response molecules in hgfs and gingival/oral epithelia  <cit> . moreover, it was noted that both p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and e. coli lps significantly upregulated the expression of mmp- <dig> mrna but not its protein as compared to the controls. a number of factors may account for this finding, such as the stability of mrna, its processing and splicing patterns, half-life of the target protein and post-translational modifications  <cit> . therefore, in the present study increase in mmp- <dig> mrna expression level may not be necessarily reflected at its protein level.

timps exhibit high affinity for binding with mmps and lead to inhibition of their activities. in the present study, timp- <dig> mrna was upregulated by p. gingivalis lps1435/1449-treated hgfs, while no significant up-regulation was observed in p. gingivalis lps1690-stimulated cells. the current results may not be comparable with previous studies in which the structural heterogeneity of lps was not fully considered  <cit> . this omission may account for the conflicting reports in the literature. hence, some studies have observed lower timp- <dig> levels in the conditioned media of hgfs in response to p. gingivalis lps  <cit> . in contrast, other studies have noted the increased expression level of timp- <dig> in gingival crevicular fluid of periodontitis patients  <cit> . moreover, periodontal treatment could alter the balance between mmp- <dig> and timp- <dig>  <cit> . based upon the current findings, further study may be warranted to explore the association of different isoforms of p. gingivalis lps with periodontal conditions in periodontal patients and the possible effect of periodontal treatment on the expression of these lps isoforms by p. gingivalis. in addition, the discrepancy observed in timp- <dig> mrna and protein expression following the stimulation of both p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> and e. coli lps in hgfs could be due to the complex regulation of transcription and translation  <cit> .

lps is the major immuno-stimulatory component of p. gingivalis which has shown to be capable of interacting with tlrs. binding of lps to tlrs activates the downstream signal transduction pathways such as nf-ĸb and mapk  <cit> . previous studies have suggested that the activation of mmps could be through both nf-ĸb and mapk signaling  <cit> . the present study demonstrated that p <dig> mapk and erk are critically involved in p. gingivalis lps1690- and e. coli lps-induced expression of mmp- <dig> in hgfs. this finding is supported by a previous study that p <dig> mapk and erk1/ <dig> pathways are essential for the expression and regulation of mmps in various cell types in response to lps  <cit> . erk, jnk and p <dig> mapk pathways play vital roles in regulating the expression of mmps induced by various stimulants such as cytokines  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the nature of the stimuli could result in specific signal transduction pathway in the same cell type. for instance, mapk inhibitor significantly reduced the mmp- <dig> production in hgfs stimulated with il-1β, but not with epidermal growth factor  <cit> . in addition, nf-ĸb pathway may be involved in regulation of mmp- <dig> expression in rabbit dermal fibroblasts, human saphenous vein and rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells  <cit> . the present study showed that nf-ĸb signaling is not critically involved in lps-induced mmp- <dig> expression in hgfs. notably, the mapk pathway but not nf-κb was significantly involved in the regulation of mmp- <dig> expression in hgfs in both mrna and protein levels. previous studies have also proven that the expression of mmp- <dig> is mainly mediated through p <dig> mapk, erk and tyrosine kinase pathways, but not through nf-κb pathway  <cit> . moreover, although a study reported that the activation of nf-κb could be important for mmp- <dig> secretion, no consensus nf-κb binding site was identified in the mmp- <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . it suggests that nf-κb may regulate the expression of this gene through different binding sites or interacting with other transcription factors  <cit> . therefore, within the context and limitations of the present study, it is tempting to speculate that mapk pathway may be crucial for mmp- <dig> expression in hgfs in response to p. gingivalis lps <dig>  furthermore, it would be interesting to extend the study to other cells types in human gingiva like gingival epithelial cells to ascertain whether mapk pathway plays a predominant role in the expression and regulation of mmp- <dig> in other cells of oral tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study reveals that hgfs significantly express mmp- <dig> in response to penta-acylated p. gingivalis lps <dig> and hexa-acylated e. coli lps, but not to the tetra-acylated p. gingivalis lps1435/ <dig> in hgfs. blocking p <dig> mapk and erk pathways significantly down-regulates p. gingivalis lps1690- and e. coli lps-induced expression of mmp- <dig>  these findings indicate that the heterogeneous lipid a structures of p. gingivalis lps differentially modulate the expression of mmp- <dig> in hgfs, which may play a role in periodontal pathogenesis.
