BACKGROUND
protein-protein interactions  play key roles in various cellular processes, including metabolic cycles, dna transcription and replication, and signalling cascades. correctly identifying and characterizing protein interactions are critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms inside the cell  <cit> . in recent years, the researchers developed a couple of innovative techniques for identifying the interactions among proteins  <cit> . due to the progress in high-throughput biological techniques such as mass spectrometric , tandem affinity purification   <cit>  and other large-scale experimental approaches for ppis identification, an immense amount of ppis data for different organisms has been accumulated  <cit> .

however, the high-throughput experimental approaches are time consuming and expensive. thus, current ppis data generated with experimental methods only cover a small fraction of the complete ppi networks  <cit> . in addition, high-throughput biological techniques suffer from high false negative and false positive rates  <cit> . therefore it is very important and urgent to develop the efficient and reliable computational approaches to facilitate the detection of protein interactions  <cit> .

a number of computational techniques have been developed to provide either complementary information or supporting evidence to experimental methods  <cit> . existing approaches typically use binary classification frameworks that differ in the features used to represent protein pairs. different protein attributes or feature sources, such as protein domains, gene neighbourhood, phylogenetic profiles, gene expression, and literature mining knowledge are employed to infer protein interactions <cit> . there are also approaches that integrate the interaction information from a couple of different biological data sources <cit> . however, if the pre-knowledge about the proteins is not available the aforementioned approaches cannot be implemented.

recently, a number of attempts which derive information directly from amino acid sequence have been made to develop computational model to help in discovering new ppis  <cit> . the experimental results in previous works showed that the information of protein primary sequences alone is sufficient to detect protein interactions  <cit> . shen et al. developed an automatic and excellent identification system for predicting ppis based on protein amino acids sequence information  <cit> . in their study, the twenty protein amino acids were firstly clustered into seven clustering according to their dipoles and volumes of the side chains, and then we use the conjoint triad feature to represent of the given protein sequence based on the classification of amino acids. this approach achieves a high prediction accuracy of  <dig> % on human ppis data set. however, shen's work cannot takes neighbouring effect into account and it is generally agreed that the interactions among proteins occur in the discontinuous amino acids segments of the protein sequence. lately, guo et al. employed auto covariance  transformation method to consider the discontinuous amino acids segments in the sequence  <cit> . when applied to predict saccharomyces cerevisiae ppis, their approach achieved a high prediction accuracy of  <dig> %. in our previous studies, our methods which used autocorrelation descriptors and correlation coefficient also yielded good prediction performance  <cit> .

in this study, a novel feature representation method for prediction of ppis is proposed. we hypothesize that the continuous and discontinuous amino acids segments play an important role in determining the interactions between proteins. for example, discontinuous regions consist of amino acid residues remote from each other in primary protein sequence, yet spatially proximate in protein three-dimensional structure, which determines the interaction of proteins. in other words, the proposed protein representation method account for the interactions between sequentially distant but spatially close amino acid residues, thus it be able to adequately capture multiple overlapping continuous and discontinuous binding patterns within protein sequence.

to sum up, in this paper we propose a sequence-based approach for the prediction of protein-protein interactions using support vector machine  combined with a novel multi-scale continuous and discontinuous protein feature representation. in order to reduce the dimensionality of data and improve the accuracy of the predictor, an effective feature selection method minimum redundancy maximum relevance  is employed to select a compact and discriminative new feature subset  <cit> . the saccharomyces cerevisiae ppi dataset was employed to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. the experiment results demonstrate that our approach yielded  <dig> % prediction accuracy with  <dig> % precision at the sensitivity of <dig> %. our proposed method was also evaluated using the independent dataset of the helicobacter pylori ppis and achieved a high overall accuracy of  <dig> %, which further demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method.

RESULTS
in this section, we first briefly introduce the ppis datasets which is employed to evaluate the proposed method. then we discuss the evaluation strategies used in performance comparisons. finally, we analyse the experimental results and compare our results with the related research.

benchmark ppi datasets
to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the ppis dataset collected from yeast core subset of database of interacting proteins  has been employed. this dataset is originally derived by guo et al. and consists of  <dig>  protein pairs, where half are from the positive dataset and half are from the negative dataset  <cit> . it should be noticed that the protein pairs which contain a protein with fewer than fifty residues or have ≥40% sequence identity were removed in our ppis dataset; the remaining  <dig>  protein pairs comprise the final positive dataset. choosing negative examples is a very important for training a predictor of ppis. the common method is based on annotations of cellular localization. in this study, the  <dig>  protein pairs occurring in two different subcellular localizations were chosen as negative ppis dataset.

evaluation measures
in the experiment, the five-fold cross-validation was employed to evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed method. more specifically, the ppis dataset is randomly divided into five equally sized subsets, and then each subset is used as a testing set in turn, while the other four subsets are used for training set.

four evaluation metrics, sensitivity , precision , overall accuracy  and matthews correlation coefficient  are used to measure the prediction performance of our method. they are defined as follows:

  acc=tp+tntp+fp+tn+fn 

  sn=tptp+fn 

  pe=tptp+fp 

  mcc=tp×tn-fp×fn××× 

where tp, fp, tn and fn refer to number of true positive, number of false positive, number of true negative and number of false negative ppis, respectively. mcc is considered to be the most robust metric of any class prediction method. an mcc equal to  <dig> is regarded as a completely random prediction, whereas  <dig> is regarded as a perfect prediction.

experimental setting
in this paper, the proposed sequence-based ppi predictor was implemented using matlab platform. for svm algorithm, the implementation of libsvm available from http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm was utilized, which was originally developed by chang and lin  <cit> . the radial basis function was chosen as the kernel function and the optimized parameters  were obtained with a grid search approach. regarding mrmr, the implementation by peng and ding available from http://penglab.janelia.org/proj/mrmr/ was used. all the simulations were carried out on a computer with  <dig>  ghz 2-core cpu,  <dig> gb memory and windows operating system.

prediction performance of proposed model
the dip ppis data which investigated in guo et al. was adopted to evaluate the performance of the proposed model  <cit> . proper parameters setting can improve the svm classification accuracy; therefore the corresponding parameters for svm were firstly optimized. here, two parameters, c and gamma , were determined using the grid search approach within a limited range. to guarantee that the experimental results are valid and can be generalized for making predictions regarding new data, the dataset is randomly partitioned into training and independent testing sets via a 5-fold cross validation. each of the five subsets acts as an independent holdout testing dataset for the model trained with the rest of four subsets. thus five models were generated for the five sets of data. the advantages of cross validation are that the impact of data dependency is minimized and the reliability of the results can be improved.

the prediction performance of svm predictor with mcd representation of protein sequence across five runs are shown in table  <dig>  compared with several published results for the same dataset. from table  <dig> we observed that high overall accuracy in the range of  <dig> %- <dig> % is obtained for the proposed model. to better evaluate the prediction performance of the proposed method, other four evaluation metrics including sensitivity, precision, mcc, and auc are calculated in the study. it can be observed from table  <dig> that the proposed method yielded good prediction performance with an average sensitivity value of  <dig> %, precision value of  <dig> %, ,auc value of  <dig> %and mcc value of  <dig> %. in addition, we can observed from table  <dig> that the standard deviation of overall accuracy, precision, sensitivity, mcc and auc are as low as  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively.

we further compared our method with guo et al. <cit> , zhou et al. <cit>  and yang et al. <cit> , where the svm, svm and knn was performed with the conventional auto covariance, local descriptor, and local descriptor representation as the input feature vectors, respectively. from table  <dig>  we can see that the performance of all of these methods with different machine learning model and sequence based feature representation are lower than ours, which indicates that our improvements are resulted from adopting the proposed mcd descriptor to represent the protein sequences. in a word, we may safely draw the conclusion that the proposed method generally outperforms the previous approaches with higher discrimination power for detecting ppis based the information of protein amino acids sequences. therefore, we can see clearly that our model is a much more efficient method for predicting ppis compared with existing approaches methods. therefore, it makes us be more convinced that our new method will be a useful tool for protein interaction prediction community.

comparing the prediction performance with other methods
we performed the ppis dataset for helicobacter pylori to highlight the advantage of the proposed model. the h. pylori ppis dataset is originally derived by martin et al. and composed of  <dig>  interacting pair and  <dig>  non-interacting pairs for a total of  <dig>  protein pairs,  <cit> . this dataset is adopted to performs a comparison of proposed method with several existing works including phylogenetic bootstrap <cit> , hknn  <cit> , ensemble of hknn  <cit> , signature products  <cit>  and boosting  <cit> . the methods of phylogenetic bootstrap, signature products and hknn are based on individual classifier system to infer ppis, while the methods of hknn and boosting belong to ensemble-based classifiers. the average prediction results of ten-fold cross-validation over six different approaches are given in table  <dig>  from table  <dig>  we can see that the average prediction performance, i.e. accuracy, sensitivity, precision and mcc achieved by proposed predictor, are  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. it demonstrates that our method outperforms all other individual classifier-based methods such as phylogenetic bootstrap. it can be also observed that the proposed method clearly yields a comparable performance with the other ensemble classifier systems . all these results demonstrate that our model substantially improves the performance in the prediction of ppis.

incremental feature selection  and optimal feature subset
the incremental feature selection  procedure was used to find an optimal subset from the mrmr feature list generated above  <cit> . suppose the total number of the features is . we can obtain feature subsets which are initiated from a subset containing one feature and generated by adding them one by one from the mrmr feature list. then svm predictors were constructed with 5-fold cross-validation based on the feature subsets. finally the ifs curve of mcc to the different feature subset was plotted. an optimal feature subset was obtained with which the corresponding predictor yields the best mcc. the detailed analysis of the experimental results in this section and the ifs curve are available at the website: http://csse.szu.edu.cn/staff/youzh/mcdppi.zip.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have proposed an efficient technique for predicting protein interactions from protein primary sequences by combining a novel multi-scale continuous and discontinuous  feature representation with svm model. the mcd representation takes into account the factors that the ppis usually occur in discontinuous segments in the protein sequence, where distant amino acid residues are brought into spatial proximity by protein folding. a protein sequence was characterized by a number of regions using mcd representation, which is capable of capturing multiple overlapping continuous and discontinuous binding patterns within a protein sequence. in order to reduce the noise and irrelevant features which affect the protein prediction performance, the mrmr method was adopted for feature selection. experimental results show that our method performed significantly well in predicting protein interactions. achieved results demonstrate that the proposed approach is very promising for predicting ppi and can be a useful supplementary tool to traditional experimental method.
