BACKGROUND
glaucoma is a blinding disease characterized by the progressive death of retinal ganglion cells. the principal risk factor for glaucoma is elevated intraocular pressure   <cit> . biomechanical engineering studies suggest that iop-related stress is focused on ganglion cell axons exiting the eye through the lamina cribrosa  <cit> . current models suggest that optic nerve glia are adversely affected and that this leads first to destruction of the ganglion cell axon, and secondarily, to the apoptotic death of the ganglion cell soma .

glaucoma is a complex genetic disease  <cit> . after elevated iop, family history is the next most important risk factor  <cit> . while many important studies have revealed a great deal about the genetics of this disease, the majority of these have been restricted to relatively rare forms that exhibit some form of mendelian inheritance and for which there are large pedigrees that contribute both phenotypic and genotypic information. for most forms of glaucoma, there is limited understanding of the genetics underlying disease susceptibility. one approach to identifying glaucoma susceptibility alleles is to first identify candidate genes using mouse genetics. specifically, we hypothesized that the process of retinal ganglion cell death may be affected by genetic background. several studies in mice have documented quantitative trait loci  that associate with neuronal degeneration. these include loci that affect neuronal susceptibility in the substantia nigra to the parkinsonian drug mptp  <cit>  or sensitivity to kainic acid in the hippocampus  <cit> . additionally, reduced bax expression in ganglion cells created in gene dosage experiments, completely abrogates soma death in both acute optic nerve lesion and chronic glaucoma models in mice  <cit> .

in an effort to identify alleles affecting ganglion cell death, we screened inbred mice to examine if genetic background influenced cell loss after optic nerve crush. this lesion stimulates several of the same molecular pathways active in dying ganglion cells in glaucoma  <cit> . a screen of  <dig> different lines showed that genetic background did affect the loss of these cells. reciprocal backcross breeding experiments using the most resistant  and susceptible lines  indicated that the resistant phenotype was attributable to 1– <dig> dominant loci  <cit> . in this report, we have extended this observation to show the results of a genome wide screen of a large f <dig> mapping population generated from these two parental inbred lines. this study reveals a single significant dominant qtl on chromosome  <dig> that associates with the cell death phenotype. we have designated this locus as retinal ganglion cell susceptible  <dig> .

RESULTS
a single dominant qtl affecting retinal ganglion cell death is located on chromosome 5
a population of  <dig> f <dig> mice underwent optic nerve crush and cell loss phenotyping. the distribution of phenotypes in this population  matched well with a smaller population of f <dig> mice examined previously  <cit> , indicating that the phenotype was consistently inherited. for genome wide mapping, we selected mice from the f <dig> population that had 54% or less cells remaining  and 64% or more cells remaining . these animals are indicated by the filled bars in the phenotype frequency histograph of the f <dig> population .

quantitative trait linkage analysis using  <dig> microsatellite markers, with and without sex as a covariate, showed a single significant peak on chromosome  <dig> between markers d5mit <dig>  and d5mit <dig>  . the maximum lod score predicted by interval analysis was  <dig>  at chr <dig> loc <dig> , which was the only locus that exceeded the significance level of p =  <dig>  . the next highest lod score in the analysis of all the samples modeled without interactive covariates was  <dig>  for d6mit <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . it is notable that evaluation of larger numbers of animals from the f <dig> population may have not only increased the significance of the locus on chromosome  <dig>  but also increased the lod score at chr <dig> loc <dig>  to above the threshold value. the qtl dataset was also analyzed for interacting loci, again including sex as a covariate. no significant associations were detected at the resolution of this genome-wide screen, thus a single locus on chromosome  <dig> accounts for  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance of this trait. this locus has been designated as retinal ganglion cell susceptible  <dig> . for subsequent analyses, we have conservatively defined this locus by the nearest markers used for mapping. this  <dig> mb region includes an approximation of the 95% confidence interval as suggested by a  <dig>  lod drop from the peak  <cit> .

we also examined the inheritance pattern of phenotype as a function of marker d5mit <dig>  which lies closest to the region with the statistical maximum lod score . mice inheriting  <dig> balb/c alleles have significantly fewer cells remaining than mice inheriting  <dig> or  <dig> dba/2j alleles . conversely, mice heterozygous for the dba/2j locus exhibited a statistically equivalent phenotype to mice homozygous at this locus . together, these data are supportive of our original observation of the mendelian-dominant nature of the rgcs <dig> locus obtained from reciprocal breeding experiments  <cit> .

identification of candidate genes in the rgcs <dig> locus
genomic sequence information, available for multiple different strains of mice , was examined to identify candidate genes. the region of chr <dig> loc34- <dig> was found to be relatively gene poor, with a total of  <dig> known genes and/or expressed sequence tags  identified. based on existing sequence data, we used in silico analysis to find single nucleotide polymorphisms  creating non-synonymous amino acid changes between the dba/2j and balb/cbyj strains. this search identified  <dig> amino acid changes in  <dig> genes . of these changes,  <dig> were conservative changes and  <dig> were non-conservative, including  <dig> that change a hydrophobic amino acid in dba/2j mice to a proline in balb/c mice .

*conservative vs non-conservative amino acids  were assigned based on differences in charge and hydrophobicity. †strain clustering refers to data showing the same snp in at least one reference mouse strain with a similar quantitative phenotype. a score of no indicates a dba/2j or balb/c polymorphism in at least one conflicting reference strain. a score of possible indicates polymorphisms that fit trend for intermediate strains, but for which there is limited data for reference strains, or where there is data only for one set of reference strains. reference strains examined were 129x1/svj and c57bl/6j for dba/2j mice, and nod/ltj and c3h/hej for balb/cbyj mice. intermediate strains were a/j and nzb/binj  <cit> .

we also examined the list of polymorphisms for similarities to other mouse strains with cell death phenotypes similar to either the resistant or susceptible strains. of the  <dig> genes identified,  <dig> genes clearly exhibited strain clustering of a polymorphism, while  <dig> other genes  showed possible clustering. the basis for this latter definition was that only partial sequence data was available for reference strains or intermediate strains . of these  <dig> potential genes,  <dig> exhibited non-conservative amino acid changes.

a second layer of analysis was then conducted to identify genes in this region that were highly expressed or enriched in cells of the ganglion cell layer, including ganglion cells themselves, by screening available microarray data. four genes in the rgcs <dig> region were found as being either highly enriched, or highly expressed, in the ganglion cell layer and optic nerve head, including pcdh <dig>  uchl <dig>  sparcl <dig>  and cplx <dig> . of these  <dig>  sparcl <dig> appeared on both lists of snp-containing genes and genes expressed in the ganglion cell layer. all  <dig> of these candidate genes showed a decrease in expression level in arrays of axotomized or glaucomatous rat retinas  <cit> .

csingle nucleotide polymorphism  analysis was conducted in silico using sequence information available on the mgi data base. snps that resulted in coding region changes between dba/2j and balb/cbyj mice were examined.

dcoding region snps between dba/2j and balb/cbyj mice were compared to reference strains if sequence data were available. reference strains included 129x1/svj and c57bl/6j as resistant strains comparable to dba/2j mice, and nod/ltj and c3h/hej as susceptible strains comparable to balb/cbyj mice. intermediate strains included a/j  and nzb/binj . for genes showing a snp difference, if the same snp was noted in the reference strains it was scored as showing a positive strain association. a possible strain association was recorded if sequence data was limited to only a resistant or susceptible reference strain, or the intermediate strains showed the predicted strain association, but there was not data available for the reference strains. if no snp was noted, the strain association analysis was not applicable .

finally, a search of the  <dig> genes was made to identify candidates that had already been identified as susceptibility alleles for other neurodegenerative diseases. this search yielded  <dig> genes, hspb <dig> and uchl <dig>  the latter gene was also identified in the search of genes present in the retinal ganglion cell layer. collectively, using the criteria of expression in the retina, ganglion cell layer, or other cns neurons; and/or the presence of strain-specific non-conserved amino acid changes; and/or the involvement of genes in neurodegeneration, we identified  <dig> genes as possible candidate genes that could affect retinal ganglion cell death after lesion to the optic nerve .

discussion
in an attempt to determine if genetic background influences the process of retinal ganglion cell death after damage to the optic nerve, we conducted a screen of inbred mice for susceptibility to a crush lesion of the optic nerve. breeding studies conducted as part of this series of experiments, suggested that resistance to crush was inherited in a dominant fashion involving relatively few alleles  <cit> . this finding was expanded to conduct genome wide mapping of a population of f <dig> mice generated from resistant  and susceptible  parental strains. mapping identified a single qtl on chromosome  <dig>  spanning a region of  <dig> cm delineated by markers d5mit <dig> and d5mit <dig>  which significantly associated with the dominant inheritance of resistance to the crush procedure. in silico analysis of the  <dig> known genes and ests in this region identified  <dig> candidate genes that can be studied further, in concert with more detailed mapping studies to narrow the region of interest.

rgcs <dig> represents a novel qtl relative to other loci that have been mapped in association with neurodegeneration. these include qtls on chromosomes  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  <cit> , that associate with mptp toxicity and a qtl on chromosome  <dig> that affects susceptibility to kainic acid  <cit> . interestingly, rgcs <dig> lies within a qtl that maps between  <dig> and  <dig> cm on chromosome  <dig> that affects the thresholds for electroshock induced seizures in mice  <cit> . the causative gene is likely not linked to rgcs <dig>  however, since dba/2j mice exhibit greater susceptibility to electroshock. lastly, inbred strains of mice exhibit a bimodal distribution of retinal ganglion cell number in adult animals that has been genetically mapped to a qtl on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . since ganglion cell number in adults is influenced by the process of cell death during development, this region has been examined for its effects on both ganglion cell specification and production, and on programmed cell death   <cit> . examinations of cell number before the onset of pcd, however, showed that strains with large numbers of ganglion cells as adults generally had equally large numbers of immature cells, and vice versa, suggesting that the process of cell death was not affected by this qtl.

summary of candidate genes and their relevance to retinal ganglion cell death and neurodegeneration
the  <dig> candidate genes  are distributed in two main clusters, each at either end of the  <dig> cm interval currently defining the rgcs <dig> locus . in response to a lesion of the optic nerve, each candidate gene could realistically play a role in the process of retinal ganglion cell death. however, this does not preclude the possibility that a different gene  in this region may be responsible for the qtl. also, it is important to note that our evaluation of candidate genes did not address the possibility that the causative gene could be an expression qtl, where polymorphisms in the promoter region could affect expression levels. alternatively, non-coding polymorphisms could also create alternative splice variants in some genes that can affect protein structure or transcript stability. lastly, our in silico analysis did not address the possibilities of differences in non-coding rnas  that may exist between the two strains, but which could also affect gene expression and cellular processes. still, the filters we used for selection criteria were biased towards assessing relevant features that could dramatically account for a qtl between the two strains. a summary of each gene follows:

pcdh <dig> 
pcdh <dig> is one of a member of a family of cadherin like molecules that play a specialized role in cell-cell interactions within the central nervous system  <cit> . the functional role of pcdh <dig> is not well understood, but splice variants have been implicated in altering cell adhesion properties. this may affect both ganglion cell and retinal glial cell gene expression profiles by modifying cellular interactions with the extracellular matrix.

tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> 
there are  <dig> known tlr genes in mice and all of them are expressed by microglia in the cns  <cit> . in addition, indirect evidence suggests that astrocytes also express at least some tlr genes. they function by allowing microglia to recognize and respond to a wide variety of pathogens and injury-resulting antigens, thus implicating these cells in both the innate and adaptive immune response of the cns. it is not known if tlrs play a role in the activation response of microglia after optic nerve injury, but through tlr activation  <cit> , these cells have been shown to express mhc class ii proteins and act as antigen presenting cells in models of demyelinating diseases in mice  <cit> . genetically controlled selective autoimmunity responses in mice can modulate the severity of retinal damage in acute  and chronic  models of optic nerve lesion  <cit> . this, along with the growing evidence that neuroinflammation can affect both neuronal survival and death  <cit> , makes these genes attractive candidates for the cell death phenotype.

uchl <dig> 
uchl- <dig> plays an integral role in the ubiquitin proteosome pathway. it hydrolyses small ubiquitin c-terminal adducts and may have a role in regulating the degradation of free ubiquitin monomers. studies have documented  <dig> separate polymorphisms in human uchl- <dig> that associate with either increased or decreased susceptibility to parkinson's disease, although the concordance of these studies is variable. the pathology of uchl- <dig> is most likely linked to changes in activity or expression levels. the putative parkinson's disease causing allele in uchl- <dig> results in a 50% decrease in enzyme catalytic activity  <cit> . similarly, reduced overall gene expression of uchl- <dig> is associated with the formation of lewy bodies in patients with dementia  <cit>  and the development of gracile axonal dystrophy and intraneuronal inclusions in mice  <cit> . these observations suggest that uchl <dig> expression levels may play a factor in neuronal susceptibility. in addition to its suspected role as a susceptibitily allele for chronic neurodegeneration, uchl <dig> expression is highly enriched in the ganglion cell layer. although not polymorphic, quantitative differences in expression, if any, could account for the different cell death phenotypes between strains.

sparcl <dig> 
the sparcl <dig> gene product is a secreted protein that acts as a de-adhesive molecule  <cit> . it is expressed and secreted by neurons and glia presumably to allow cells to release contact from the extracellular matrix and begin to migrate. increased sparcl <dig> expression is associated with regions of neuronal injury, possibly playing a role in the glial activation response. sparcl <dig> is the only gene we have identified that is enriched in the ganglion cell layer and has a polymorphism that results in a non-conservative amino acid change .

cplx <dig> 
complexin i is involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking in neurons. complexins associate with the vesicle snare complex at some point during or just after the process of ca2+-dependent fast synchronous transmitter release  <cit> . both complexin i and ii have been implicated in human neurodegenerative disorders, but this involvement is not clear. the increased expression of both molecules has been documented after traumatic brain injury, suggesting involvement in the glutamate release response of damaged neurons  <cit> . mice mutant for cplx <dig> develop severe ataxia and behavioral disorders  <cit> . this gene was principally identified because it is highly expressed in the ganglion cell layer. however, its potential role in excitotoxic damage may affect ganglion cell death in both optic nerve crush and glaucoma insults, where secondary degeneration mediated by glutamate-toxicity has been implicated in both models of damage  <cit> .

hspb <dig> 
hspb <dig> is a member of the small heat shock protein  family of molecular chaperones  <cit> . mutations in the α-crystallin domain of hspb <dig> in humans leads to distal hereditary motor neuropathy  <cit> , a disease characterized by the degenerative loss of motor neurons. there have been reports that several members of the shsp gene family are differentially regulated in animal models of glaucoma  <cit> , although no study has focused specifically on hspb <dig> 

rgcs <dig> and retinal ganglion cell death in glaucoma
although rgcs <dig> affects ganglion cell death after acute optic nerve crush, the role of the causative gene in this region as a susceptibility allele in glaucoma is not yet resolved. acute nerve lesion and elevated iop appear to activate a similar intrisinc apoptotic program, associated with bax-dependent mitochondrial changes  <cit>  and the activation of the caspase cascade  <cit> . additionally, genome wide microarray studies conducted on early, intermediate, and late retinal gene expression changes from both axotomy injured rat eyes and eyes with experimental glaucoma showed significant overlap in the genes that were differentially expressed in both conditions  <cit> . these changes included early injury response genes , and stress response genes . additionally, ganglion cell specific genes, such as thy <dig> and sncg, were similarly down-regulated. there were specific differences in the pattern of differentially regulated genes, however, that may reflect different mechanisms of ganglion cell pathology between the two modalities of injury. most prevalent was the up-regulation of genes involved in neuroinflammation, such as components of the complement cascade, in the experimental glaucoma retinas. thus, neurinflammation may play a greater role in ganglion cell death during a chronic neurodegenerative process, than in an acute paradigm.

interestingly, dba/2j mice, which carry the resistant rgcs <dig> genotype, exhibit a glaucoma phenotype characterized by progressive ganglion cell loss  <cit> . since the dominant rgcs <dig> allele does not completely abrogate cell death, we would not expect this strain to be completely resistant to glaucoma. instead, we speculate that dba/2j mice would exhibit a more severe phenotype if they carried the balb/cbyj allele and experiments to create such a congenic strain are underway.

the role of rgcs <dig> in glaucoma may also be inferred by comparison of mouse locus with the syntenic region in the human genome. the interval of interest on mouse chr <dig> is principally represented on human chr <dig> between 4p <dig> and 4q <dig> and a short segment of human chr <dig>  centered at 12q <dig> . to date, no linkage studies examining forms of glaucoma with mendelian inheritance patterns have identified genes or loci in these regions  <cit> . this is not surprising since these studies have depended on relatively rare forms of glaucoma, while most forms of primary open angle glaucoma exhibit much higher levels of genetic complexity  <cit> . we predict that the retinal ganglion cell susceptibility allele, if it does influence cell loss in glaucoma, would be just one of several genes that contribute to a more complex genetic disorder.

interestingly, markers on human chr <dig> that map near the region of interest , showed promising results in a genome-wide screen of dna from  <dig> sib-pairs affected with primary open angle glaucoma  <cit> . in particular, marker d4s <dig>  was initially positive in  <dig> independent analyses, including model-dependent lod scores and sib-pair maximum lod scores. marker d4s <dig>  was positive in  <dig> of  <dig> analyses. these markers on chr <dig>  however, failed to continue to show positive results when this analysis was expanded to include a second cohort of affected sib-pairs. given the small size of this sib-pair screen, it may not yet be possible to interpret the relative importance of this region in human glaucoma, but it is encouraging that it has shown some promising results in linkage studies.

CONCLUSIONS
susceptibility of retinal ganglion cell death to a crush lesion of the optic nerve is influenced by genetic background. linkage analysis of a large mapping population has helped resolve this genetic contribution to a locus on chromosome  <dig> between 34– <dig> cm. in silico examination of this region has identified  <dig> potential candidate genes that may account for the difference in ganglion cell death phenotype exhibited by the dba/2j and balb/cbyj strains. evaluation of the effect of the balb/cbyj locus in the dba/2j mouse model of glaucoma will help confirm this gene/region as being a susceptibility allele for glaucoma as well as for acute optic nerve crush.
