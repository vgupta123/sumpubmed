BACKGROUND
xanthomonas fragariae  is a bacterial strawberry pathogen and the cause of angular leaf spot. it was first described in the united states in  <dig>  <cit>  and has since spread globally. under favourable conditions the pathogen may cause significant damage to both plant stock and strawberry production  <cit> . xf is a quarantine pest on planting stock within the eu  <cit> , which may explain why this generally considered mild pathogen has remained at the heart of scientific and legislative debate for decades. xf is a distinct and homogeneous species within the otherwise complex and highly dynamic genus xanthomonas. a certain degree of infraspecific diversity within xf has been observed, but in general it is considered as a coherent and stable species .

unlike its clear taxonomic position, the disease-related capabilities of xf are still obscure. one well-established characteristic of xf is its narrow host range: fragaria spp. are the only natural hosts, although close relatives of fragaria, such as potentilla fruticosa and p. glandulosa, showed symptoms after artificial inoculation and therefore are considered potential hosts  <cit> . another, poorly characterized feature of xf is its symptomless persistence in strawberry crops  <cit> , which holds significant relevance for xf as quarantine organism in strawberry planting stock. molecular testing repeatedly demonstrated xf presence in symptomless rhizomes of strawberry plants intended for planting  <cit> . knowledge on the in planta movement of xf is limited:so far, only one study presented experimental evidence for the endophytic spread of xf down from infected strawberry leaves to the rhizome and to newly emerging runners and daughter plants  <cit> . xf is a challenging organism to study because of its fastidious nature on most common growth media  <cit> , and its rapidly declining viability after contact with strawberry leaf extracts  <cit> . moreover, xf appeared insusceptible to genetic manipulation, which hampered our efforts in developing fluorescent and functional mutants .

a whole genome sequence of xf can provide insight in its life style and help solve some of the technical problems it presents in the laboratory. recent advances in sequencing technology and bioinformatics, together with emerging commercial whole genome sequencing services, have resulted in rapid and cost-effective means of generating draft genomes fit for most plant-pathology related studies  <cit> . also within xanthomonas, multiple genome sequences are available and already provided interesting insights in the most common pathogenicity determinants of the genus  <cit> . one of the final technical challenges associated with next-generation sequencing techniques is the presence of repetitive genomic sequences  <cit> . multiple paired-read datasets with varying insert sizes are often used to resolve assembly ambiguities associated with these repetitive sequences, or at least to bridge sequence gaps by concatenating related contigs into larger scaffolds. in addition, several software tools providing automatic scaffold gap-closure have recently been released: gapcloser  <cit> , image  <cit>  and gapfiller  <cit> .

the aim of the current study was to generate a draft genome sequence of a belgian, virulent xf strain  and to analyse its virulence-related gene content by comparison to available xanthomonas whole-genome sequences. two commercially obtained paired-read datasets were combined, and an automatic gap-closure algorithm was applied, to overcome encountered assembly problems related to repetitive dna. here, we present the resulting draft genome sequence of xf lmg  <dig> and the observed virulence-related features.

RESULTS
repetitive dna content complicates genome assembly
assembling the draft genome sequence of xf was more challenging than anticipated. a first de novo assembly using a single paired-end  illumina short-read dataset  did not meet our expectations: although the contig number and n50-values of this initial draft genome sequence were on par with comparable assemblies of other xanthomonas genomes , it was considerably smaller than anticipated  and revealed an exceptionally high insertion sequences  related repetitive dna content. a second, mate-paired  illumina short-read dataset with a larger insert size was generated to avoid incomplete genome assembly caused by read ambiguity. the mp dataset did not improve the de novo assembly , and the initial pe-based de novo assembly was used to start a second assembly stage that included scaffolding of the de novo assembly with the mp dataset, and subsequent application of the automatic gap-closing algorithm gapcloser  <cit> . there was a clear improvement in both assembly quality and read disambiguation, and the current draft sufficed for our plant pathology aimed research goals. given the quick evolution of genome assembly algorithms, the public available raw sequence data generated in this study could result in a finished genome assembly in the near future.table  <dig>

phylogenetic affiliation of x. fragariae to other xanthomonas species
in this study, we compared the xf draft genome with available whole genome sequences of  <dig> other xanthomonas strains . first, we determined the phylogenetic affiliation among these  <dig> genomes using the concatenated partial sequences of four housekeeping genes  and the structural gene fyua. the results of the mlsa  were congruent with earlier phylogenetic studies of the genus xanthomonas <cit> . the subdivision between the “core” of the genus and the two outliers x. albilineans gpe pc <dig> and x. sacchari ncppb  <dig> was most evident. also, xf clearly represented a distinct phylogenetic lineage within the xanthomonas core group.figure  <dig>

xf reveals genome reduction similar to x. oryzae and x. albilineans
even after the second genome assembly, the total contig size of the xf draft genome  was still implying a considerable genome reduction. because genome reduction had already been reported for x. albilineans  and x. oryzae pv. oryzae   <cit> , we compared the cds content of xf with that of xalb gpe pc <dig> and xoo kacc  <dig> using the edgar software framework  <cit> . we further included x. campestris pv. campestris atcc  <dig>  and x. euvesicatoria 85– <dig> , respectively a vascular and a non-vascular pathogen, as references of non-reduced genomes. edgar analysis indicated a substantial genome reduction in xf, which was at least in part similar to xoo and xalb . this was most apparent from the  <dig> cds shared by xcc and xcv but absent in xalb, xoo and xf. additionally, the  <dig> cds exclusively missing in xf suggested that the genome reduction in xf was more extensive than in xoo , but not as extreme as in xalb . the lists of missing and present cds, acquired from the edgar analysis , were used as a starting point for all further genome comparisons in this study, and were checked by independent protein and nucleotide blast queries in all  <dig> xanthomonas genomes before inclusion in this manuscript.figure  <dig>

the reduced xf genome has the major virulence-related gene regions
the lists of cds from the edgar analysis  indicated that xf did not lose critical pathogenesis-related gene clusters reported for xanthomonas. contrary to the more reduced xalb genome, for example, the xf genome contained the hrp gene cluster coding for the structural elements of the type iii secretion system  and the gum gene cluster for extracellular polysaccharide  synthesis . it also contained the gene cluster coding for a common type iv secretion system  in xanthomonas, which was entirely missing in xoo and only partly retained in xcv. xf did lose the xcs-coded type ii secretion system , similar to xoo and xalb, but this gene cluster was reported as less critical for xanthomonas pathogenicity than the clearly present xps-coded t2ss  <cit> . also reported as unessential for virulence and absent in xf, are the gum-associated genes gumn, gumo and gump, and the rpf-associated genes rpfd  and rpfi <cit> .table  <dig>

although some absent gene-regions in xf may have virulence-related implications, the genome reduction in xf seems to weaken nutritional and adaptive flexibility rather than clear virulence functions. for example, the absence of all three xylan degradation loci and the ß-ketoadipate pathway may indicate that xf is unable to respectively degrade xylan and metabolize the phenolic components of lignin, two important elements of the secondary plant cell wall  <cit> . perhaps, the opinion that primarily soil bacteria have been associated with lignin degradation  <cit> , might suggest that the main role of the ß-ketoadipate pathway lays in saprophytic survival. likewise, though the glyoxylate shunt pathway has been linked to successful symbiotic and pathogenic plant-bacterial interactions, it does so by increasing metabolic fitness through growth on c2-compounds  <cit> . potassium is another important nutritional element, crucial for cell turgor maintenance, activation of cellular enzymes and ph homeostasis. the kdp potassium transport system is widely distributed among bacteria and serves as an emergency k+-scavenging system that is only expressed and activated under extreme environmental stress  <cit> . maybe these missing functions are redundant for xf’s existence in the strawberry leaf apoplast. among the  <dig> analysed xanthomonas genomes, the xylan degradation pathway, the sdk potassium transport system and the entire phenolics degradation pathway were uniquely missing in xf.

the xf genome has a reduced tonb-dependent transporter set
the edgar analysis suggested a substantial loss of tonb-dependent transporters  in xf, xoo and xalb. therefore, we screened all  <dig> xanthomonas genomes for homologs of  <dig> tbdt references . overall, the average tbdt gene repertoire amounted to  <dig> homologs with a standard deviation of  <dig>  then again only  <dig> homologs could be found in xf, which was the second smallest tbdt repertoire after xalb  . the xoo and xoc genomes had  <dig> to  <dig> homologs. the extensive tbdt repertoire in xcc has been linked to niche diversity and carbohydrate scavenging in the oligotrophic conditions encountered during epiphytic survival  <cit> . in turn, the small tbdt sets in xf, xalb and the x. oryzae strains may be yet another adaptation to a stable and restricted niche.figure  <dig>

xf has a reduced plant cell wall degrading enzyme set
observing the missing xylan degradation and ß-ketoadipate pathways in xf, triggered us to study its cell wall degrading enzyme  repertoire in greater detail. to this end, all  <dig> xanthomonas genomes were screened for homologs of  <dig> cwde references . the average number of pectinolytic, cellulolytic and hemicellulolytic enzyme homologs thus retrieved in each genome was  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, with standard deviations of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the average total cwde repertoire consisted of  <dig> homologs, with a standard deviation of  <dig>  with only  <dig> homologs, xf revealed the smallest cwde repertoire comprised of an apparently unreduced pectinolytic enzyme repertoire but with low numbers of cellulolytic  and hemicellulolytic  enzymes . small cwde repertoires were again also apparent in the genomes of xalb , xoc , and to a lesser extent in the three xoo strains . for the  <dig> xanthomonas genomes analysed, no clear correlation could be observed between the cwde repertoires and their infection mode: only the xcc3534-like cellobiosidase appeared unique for vascular pathogens.figure  <dig>

despite the contribution of cwdes to virulence, the reduced set of xf does not necessarily make it a lesser pathogen. smaller cwde repertoires are typically found in biotrophic pathogens, who rely on precise breaching of the host cell wall during infection instead of extensive tissue destruction observed for necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . one potential explanation for the reduced cwde repertoire of xf may be found in the concurrent absence of the ß-ketoadipate phenolics degradation pathway: strawberry plant tissue is rich in phenolics  <cit>  and many contribute to plant defence as phytoanticipins or phytoalexins, which are often released when plant cell integrity is compromised  <cit> . therefore, one could hypothesize that one way for xf to survive long-term residence in its potentially toxic host is to avoid extensive tissue damage.

xf exhibits a distinct t3se repertoire and several putatively new effectors
because several xf-exclusive cds in the edgar analysis showed similarity with type iii secretion effector  genes, we compared the t3se genes of xf with those of the other  <dig> xanthomonas genomes. classifying the xf-effectors within the currently defined effector-families  <cit> , however, was challenging. some effector families contained clearly distinct subgroups with lower than 70% inter-subgroup pairwise protein sequence similarities, as indicated here for xopa . a more restrictive definition and further subdivision of the current t3se-families could improve the classification. for now, we retained the classification as defined by white et al.   <cit> , except for xopag, and applied a general cut-off of 60% pairwise protein sequence similarity within a given effector family. for xopag we suggest the division into two subfamilies: xopag <dig> and xopag <dig>  with  and  as respective reference sequences, encountered in the genome of x. axonopodis pv. punicae lmg  <dig>  the xf-effector gene  was unambiguously classified in xopag <dig> . using the 60% cut-off rule, we identified homologs of  <dig> known xanthomonas t3ses in xf, with two homologs for xopx . presence of at least one xopad homolog and multiple xopp homologs was suggested, but could not be confirmed due to incomplete genome assembly.figure  <dig>

comparison of the effector gene repertoire identified in xf and in the other  <dig> xanthomonas genomes is shown . for simplicity, multiple homologs of a certain effector class within a single genome were marked only once. transcription activator-like effectors  were not included in the comparison because xf did not appear to contain any, and also tales are distinct from the other effectors in both coding sequences and function  <cit> . among the  <dig> hrp-positive genomes, the average t3se repertoire consisted of  <dig> different families, with a standard deviation of  <dig> . explicit small t3se repertoires were observed in x. campestris pv. raphani 756c  and in x. arboricola lmg  <dig>   <cit> , while xcv revealed the largest repertoire with  <dig> effectors.figure  <dig>

although the t3se repertoire of xf seemed average-sized , it distinguished itself by the presence of multiple rare effectors: xopb, xopc <dig>  xope <dig>  xopz <dig>  xopaf and xopas. this distinct t3se repertoire in xf was also evident from the isolated position of xf in a neighbor joining split network based on binary representations of the t3se repertoires found among all  <dig> hrp-positive genomes . interestingly, the general topology of the t3se-based network correlated well with the mlsa based phylogenetic tree shown before, suggesting that at least a fraction of the t3se repertoire was acquired early and evolved slowly during the formation of the major lineages within the genus.figure  <dig>

in addition to this unique “known” t3se repertoire, the xf genome also revealed several putative new effectors . three putative t3ses in xf showed low homology with the known xanthomonas effectors xopc, xope and xopad:  showed highest pairwise similarity  with a t3se found in the genus ralstonia,  showed  <dig> % similarity to an unidentified protein in mesorhizobium, and  showed up to  <dig> % pairwise similarity with an unidentified protein in x. gardneri atcc  <dig>  nine other putative t3ses in xf showed distant homology with both xopd and psva, a t3se family in acidovorax and pseudomonas contributing to host specificity, plant defence suppression and in planta pathogen proliferation  <cit> . although the function of these putative new t3ses still needs to be confirmed, the likely plant-inducible-promoter  sequences  <cit> , frequently found in the vicinity of their coding sequences, suggest virulence-related functions for these proteins. the low%gc value observed in  <dig> of these coding sequences might suggest that they were acquired through horizontal gene transfer .table  <dig>

xf harbours a type vi secretion system similar to x. oryzae
two loci shared between xf and xoo in the edgar analysis appeared to code for structural elements of a type vi secretion system . coding sequences for putative vgr protein-like t6ss effectors were encountered in the xf genome, although their exact number and sequence could not be established due to incomplete assembly. the t6ss is the most recently found secretion system in gram-negative bacteria, and several distinct types are widely distributed among the proteobacteria <cit> . in contrast to their common structure, which is analogous to the injection apparatus of bacteriophages, the specific roles of each of these distinct t6sss are still obscure: some systems were shown to contribute to the modification of eukaryotic hosts within both pathogenic and symbiotic relationships, while others were linked to inter-bacterial activity during the struggle for niche dominance  <cit> . all  <dig> xanthomonas genomes were searched for the presence of t6sss using a widely retained t6ss-related protein class  as bait  <cit> , which revealed the presence of three distinct t6sss within the genus . the t6ss of xf appeared highly similar to one of the two t6sss that were found in the x. oryzae genomes. this distinct, previously thought x. oryzae-exclusive, t6ss has been correlated with plant host specialization because of its similarity with the t6ss found in plant pathogens like ralstonia solanacearum and pseudomonas syringae <cit> . the same study grouped the other two t6sss that were observed here, in a widely distributed t6ss class present in both animal and plant pathogens, suggesting a broader functionality. of course, this in-silico based hypothesis would need further experimental confirmation.figure  <dig>

evidence of considerable horizontal gene transfer and a crispr in xf
in addition to some virulence genes that are possibly acquired by horizontal gene transfer  and is elements, other evidence of hgt-exposure could be found in the xf genome. the is-content appeared exceptionally abundant in xf. while is abundance is a common feature of xanthomonas genomes, exceptionally high is content was previously reported for the three xoo strains and the xoc strain . there, it was interpreted as a result of the consistent association of these strains with rice: the stable environment would have alleviated the selective pressure of many genes, allowing their disruption by is. a similar process could be envisioned for xf. conversely, it has also been described as an important source of genome plasticity in x. oryzae and a cause of the genotypic diversity within the species  <cit> . this seems to conflict with the restricted genotypic diversity reported for xf. perhaps the relatively young practice of formal plant breeding in strawberry cultivation   <cit>  compared to the ancient domestication of rice   <cit>  has to be considered.

possible hgt-related cds in xf were a set of phage coding genes , nine toxin-antitoxin  modules   <cit> , and nine contigs with a total sequence length of  <dig> kb exhibiting more than 90% overall dna sequence identity with the  <dig> kb plasmid ii of x. albilineans gpe pc <dig>  the latter nine contigs mainly coded for the structural elements of a second, phylogenetic distinct t4ss, and plasmid replication functions. although this raised the possibility of an autonomous plasmid in xf, so far we were unable to identify or isolate any plasmid dna from the sequenced strain .table  <dig>

finally, the xf genome revealed a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats -region comprised of  <dig> crispr associated  genes of the so-called ypest  subtype , a 121 bp long at-rich leader sequence and a crispr containing  <dig> identical repeats and  <dig> spacers. a second, smaller locus containing an additional  <dig> repeats and  <dig> spacers was also found, although the last repeat in this locus was degenerated. among all other studied xanthomonas genomes, cas-genes of the ypest-subtype were also found in xalb and x. campestris pv. raphani 756c . moreover, the associated crispr repeat sequence in xf  was identical to that of xcr, and diverged only one nucleotide from that of xalb . crispr regions were recently recognized as a prokaryotic adaptive immune system against invading dna molecules, with functional analogy to the rna interference  pathways in eukaryotes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the draft genome sequence of xf provided valuable insight in its general and more specific pathogenicity-related gene content. although the current total contig size of  <dig>  mb is not definite, the sheer amount of missing gene homologs in xf is sufficient evidence for a significant genome reduction. a similar “convergent genome erosion” was already reported for x. albilineans and x. oryzae pv. oryzae, and ascribed to their restricted lifestyle within the xylem vessels of their hosts  <cit> . a similar genome reduction was found here in xf and also in x. oryzae pv. oryzicola bls <dig>  which are two non-vascular leaf pathogens. therefore, it may be more accurate to ascribe the convergent genome reduction of these xanthomonas species to their endophytic lifestyle and typically to their commitment to a single host. similar to earlier comparative genomic studies within xanthomonas <cit> , we were unable to find clear determinants for host or tissue specificity. perhaps this specificity is the result of a more complex interplay between different genes or, of a subtle sequence variation within a small set of conserved genes. alternatively, clear host or tissue determinants may still remain hidden within the substantial group of proteins for which we currently have no clear molecular function, or in uncharacterised functional rnas.

based on the data presented here, one could hypothesize an evolutionary process for xf that is reminiscent of the model that was recently presented for some dangerous epidemic bacteria of humans  <cit> . during an initial period of intense horizontal gene transfer experienced by the more generalist ancestor of xf, acquirement of certain heterologous host-specificity factors would have allowed it to colonize the strawberry leaf apoplast and thus escape antagonists and environmental threats. this transition from a dynamic to a stable environment would subsequently have triggered the observed genome reduction: useless or redundant features, especially metabolic, perceptive and regulatory functions, were allowed to degrade and eventually were lost. at some point, the progressing genome erosion resulted in the effective metabolic “entrapment” of xf within the strawberry plant, excluding it from other hosts or more general epiphytic or saprophytic lifestyles. because of xf’s increasing spatial and phylogenetic isolation, the initially intense horizontal gene transfer would have abated, a process that was perhaps hastened by the acquirement of the crispr region. meanwhile, mobile genetic elements which conferred a selective advantage to xf would have become permanently incorporated in the genome. this evolutionary process would finally have resulted in the genotypical and phenotypical distinct, mainly endophytic, biotrophic and strawberry-specific xf known today. the eventual necrosis of the typical water-soaked angular leaf spots associated with xf would not be in conflict with this hypothesis: it could be the manifestation of an eventual breakthrough of the plant defence, or merely the collapse of an overburdened plant cellular system.

of course, many of the in-silico based hypotheses presented here should be tested and confirmed by further experimental data. in our opinion, the most appealing matters for future research are i) the molecular and functional characterization of the putatively new psva-like t3ses, ii) the exact function of the t6ss in xf and other xanthomonas, and iii) the delicate endophytic existence of xf, sensitive to toxic compounds inside the strawberry plant cells.
