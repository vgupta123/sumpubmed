BACKGROUND
the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae is a facultative anaerobic organism. it is able to respond to external oxygen availability by utilizing both respirative and fermentative metabolic modes and it grows at a fast rate even when aerobic respiration is limited or completely prevented  <cit> . metabolic response to oxygen availability requires alteration of the intracellular fluxes. the intracellular flux distribution alterations in general are mediated through transcriptional, protein level and metabolic regulation, the fluxes being the integrated network response of the regulated interactions between enzymes and metabolites  <cit> . oxygen is a major determinant of the physiology of s. cerevisiae but understanding of the oxygen dependence of intracellular metabolic flux distributions is still scarce. furthermore the dependence of the flux distribution on oxygen availability is of great interest in many biotechnological applications of s. cerevisiae, particularly those requiring a low oxygen concentration to obtain maximal product yield with simultaneous limited side products, including biomass  <cit> .

during aerobic growth oxygen serves as a final electron acceptor in respiration. when oxygen availability is limited, cells need alternative acceptors for the electrons of nadh and fadh <dig> to maintain the redox balance. in aerobic conditions the assimilatory nadh is oxidised mainly by the external nadh dehydrogenases or transported into mitochondria by the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle, whereas in the absence of oxygen s. cerevisiae produces glycerol as a redox sink  <cit> . since glycerol production leads to net hydrolysis of atp and loss of carbon, s. cerevisiae uses oxygen preferentially for oxidation of assimilatory nadh when oxygen availability is restricted  <cit> . in addition the oxidative stress to which the cells are exposed in high external oxygen availability imposes other redox challenges.

when external oxygen availability is limited s. cerevisiae generates energy partially or completely through fermentation, although it is less energy efficient than respiratory metabolism  <cit> . while the high fermentative capacity enables s. cerevisiae to produce energy at a sufficient rate even in anaerobic conditions  <cit> , constant anaerobic growth requires addition of unsaturated fatty acids and ergosterol to the culture medium since oxygen is an essential reactant in sterol biosynthesis and anabolic desaturation reactions  <cit> . furthermore, when the respiratory system coupling nadh oxidation to the generation of a proton gradient across the mitochondrial membrane is limited, additional means for cross-membrane transport of metabolites and ions are required  <cit> . growth when there is limited or no aerobic respiration thus requires an adjusment of metabolism and a major redistribution of metabolic fluxes compared to fully respiratory metabolism.

respiration of s. cerevisiae becomes restricted, not only when oxygen availability is limited, but also in fully aerobic conditions when there is an excess of repressive carbon source  <cit> . the excess repressive carbon source mediates complex transcriptional regulation, including repression of respiratory genes, and thus lowers the maximal respiratory rate. limited respiratory capacity results in alcoholic fermentation  <cit> . aerobic alcoholic fermentation is also triggered at high growth rates in aerobic chemostats  <cit> . the limited respiratory capacity in both conditions has been shown to result in redistribution of intracellular carbon fluxes through respiratory and fermentative pathways  <cit> .

intracellular metabolic flux distributions are determined by metabolic flux analysis  which is based on stoichiometric modeling, with a system of mass balance equations for intracellular metabolites  <cit> . usually the mass balance equation system is underdetermined since the number of degrees of freedom exceeds the number of measured extracellular fluxes. linear programming can be used to solve the mfa system if a biologically meaningful objective function is formulated  <cit> . including redox cofactors that are involved in all cellular metabolism into the mass balancing renders the system more constrained but requires detailed knowledge on the cofactor specificities of different isoenzymes and the relative activities of the isoenzymes in the conditions studied. this information is rarely available in the extent of a genome wide metabolic network. however, mfa with additional experimental constraints from 13c-labelling experiments combined with mass spectrometry  or nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  detection of labelling patterns in metabolic compounds  <cit>  can be used to resolve intracellular fluxes through complex pathway structures  <cit> , including compartmentalised eukaryotic metabolic networks  <cit> . the established knowledge on the topology of the metabolic network of s. cerevisiae  <cit>  enables modelling for mfa. the distribution of intracellular fluxes of s. cerevisiae to respirative and fermentative pathways in response to different reduced oxygen provisions has not been quantified with mfa combined with 13c-tracer experiments before. 13c-labelling has previously been used to quantify the redistribution of fluxes in s. cerevisiae to the respirative and fermentative pathways in response to glucose repression by comparison of batch culture fluxes to glucose-limited derepressed chemostat culture fluxes at low growth rate  <cit>  and in response to high growth rates in aerobic chemostat cultures  <cit> .

the physiology of s. cerevisiae in aerobic and in anaerobic conditions has been studied at the levels of gene expression  <cit> , metabolite concentrations and enzyme activities  <cit> , by the means of 13c-metabolic flux ratio  analysis  <cit> , metabolic flux analysis   <cit>  and regulation analysis  <cit> . 13c-tracer experiments in combination with metabolic flux analysis  have previously been applied only in studying the flux distributions of s. cerevisiae in aerobic glucose-limited chemostat cultures  <cit> . the effect of intermediate oxygenation conditions on s. cerevisiae metabolism has been the subject of some classical studies  <cit> , including studies of the dependence of gene expression in s. cerevisiae on oxygenation through heme-dependent and heme-independent regulation networks, reviewed by zitomer and lowry  and kwast et al.   <cit> . oxygen dependent transcriptional responses were observed in a range of oxygen concentrations. in addition franzén  studied ethanol production and metabolic fluxes of s. cerevisiae in respiratory quotient  controlled continuous cultures in a number of different microaerobic conditions by mfa without 13c-tracers  <cit> . franzén observed a positive correlation between biomass generation and reoxidisation of assimilatory nadh, indicating the importance of the redox balance as a determinant of the metabolic flux distribution.

the work presented here is the first where the intracellular metabolic flux distributions of s. cerevisiae in different levels of low external oxygen in chemostat cultures at low growth rate were quantified using 13c-labelling. the low growth rate,  <dig>  h- <dig>  ensured that the metabolic effects observed stemmed solely from the reduced availability of oxygen, rather than from exceeding the respiratory capacity. the flux distributions of s. cerevisiae central carbon metabolism under five different oxygenation conditions were solved by combining the metabolic pathway branching point constraints from the 13c-labelling experiments with metabolite balancing using mfa. by including the additional constraints from the 13c-labelling experiments, the cofactors could be left out from the metabolite balancing in mfa and thus the redox status regulated carbon fluxes could be reliably assessed. completely respirative metabolism was observed in fully aerobic conditions and fully fermentative metabolism in anaerobic conditions and in the three different reduced oxygenation conditions the actual amount of oxygen available was observed to result in different flux contributions through respirative and fermentative pathways. based on the flux distributions, energy generation of s. cerevisiae in the different oxygenation conditions was also determined. this paper also compares the metabolic flux distribution in different conditions of oxygen provision with the transcriptional levels of a number of metabolic genes in the same conditions, as published recently  <cit> .

RESULTS
s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-1a was grown in glucose-limited chemostats at a dilution rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> in five different oxygenation conditions . the corresponding average specific oxygen uptake rates  at these oxygen concentrations were  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  mmol o <dig> g biomass- <dig> h- <dig> as derived from a number of replicate chemostat cultivations  <cit> . the specific uptake rate of glucose, excretion rates of acetate, ethanol and glycerol and the biomass concentration in the different oxygenation conditions in the 13c labelled replicate cultivations are given in table  <dig>  net ethanol production was not observed in the aerobic cultures provided with  <dig> % oxygen, indicating a fully respiratory metabolism. in  <dig> % oxygen, slight ethanol excretion was observed indicating a shift to respiro-fermentative metabolism. in lower oxygen conditions, ethanol excretion rates increased further and the highest ethanol excretion rate was observed in anaerobic conditions, in which the metabolism was completely fermentative. as expected  <cit> , the concentration of biomass was five times lower in anaerobic than in fully aerobic cultivations. net production of glycerol was observed only in anaerobic cultivations. when only  <dig> % oxygen was provided, ethanol and co <dig> yields exceeded the yield of biomass . in anaerobic conditions the biomass yield was only one fourth of the yield of the main product ethanol. the carbon balances closed between 96–113% in all the cultures .

metabolic flux ratios were determined by metafor analysis from the fractionally 13c-labelled biomass hydrolysates by 2d nmr  <cit> . the flux ratios were calculated from the relative abundances of intact carbon backbone fragments, fragmentomers, in proteinogenic amino acids originating from a single carbon source molecule of glucose, determined from the 13c-fine structures in 2d nmr spectra . flux ratios of metabolic branching points in the central carbon metabolism of s. cerevisiae in the different oxygenation conditions are given in table  <dig>  in 13c-mfa metabolic flux ratios from the metafor analysis were used as additional constraints in a mfa system to be able to solve the metabolic net flux distribution without including the cofactors nadh and nadph or atp in the metabolite mass balances. the metabolic net fluxes in the different oxygenation conditions are shown in figure  <dig>  the confidence intervals  for the net fluxes from monte carlo simulations of noise to the flux ratio and extracellular flux rate input data are included in additional file  <dig>

glycolytic and ppp fluxes
the metafor analysis showed that in fully aerobic conditions on average 32% or less of pep originated from the ppp and the combined pool of pentose phosphates . in lower oxygen conditions, the relative ppp flux was lower and even with  <dig> % oxygen the fraction of pep originating from pentose phosphates was only 20%. the carbon flux split ratio from g6p to glycolysis and to the oxidative branch of ppp is shown in figure  <dig>  the relative flux from g6p to the ppp pathway decreased as the oxygen provision was reduced. however, the results of 13c mfa, shown in figure  <dig>  revealed that this decrease of the relative ppp flux was a result of increased glycolytic flux, while the specific flux through the oxidative branch of the ppp remained relatively constant. progressively higher glycolytic fluxes were observed in  <dig> % and in  <dig> % oxygen. in anaerobic conditions the net flux in lower glycolysis remained almost the same as in  <dig> % oxygen since a fraction of the carbon flux was lost in upper glycolysis to glycerol production. in anaerobic conditions the ppp flux contribution to pep could be somewhat overestimated since the contribution of the phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  reaction to the labelling status of pep was assumed insignificant. the flux ratio of pepck contribution to pep was generally lower when oxygen provision was lower.

the metafor analysis also gives insight into the reversible reactions of transketolase, tk, and transaldolase, ta, , since these reactions cleave the carbon backbone of the pentose phosphates in specific locations  <cit> . higher fractions of pentose phosphates showing the reversible action of a transketolase reaction were observed when less oxygen was provided than with more. there was no clear trend in the flux through the reversible transaldolase reaction, but it was low in anaerobic cultures compared to the other conditions. the high fraction of pentose phosphates cleaved by tk and ta may reflect the proposed ping-pong mechanism of these enzymes, allowing the reaction to proceed backwards before releasing the keto- or aldogroup  <cit> .

anaplerosis and the pyr branching point
the relative anaplerotic flux, the anaplerotic flux ratio defined here as the fraction of oaamit molecules originating from pep, was on average 31% and 30% in  <dig> % and  <dig> % oxygen respectively, while the relative flux from pentose phosphates to pep was lower in  <dig> % oxygen than in fully aerobic conditions . in  <dig> % oxygen the anaplerotic flux ratio was slightly higher , and it was clearly higher in  <dig> % oxygen  than in fully aerobic conditions. thus, in  <dig> % oxygen approximately half of the oaamit molecules originated from anaplerosis.

the carbon flux from pyr branches into three pathways through pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase. the pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction is the first step for the carbon flux directed to the tca cycle. the pyruvate decarboxylase reaction is the starting point for a fermentative pathway, and pyruvate carboxylase catalyses the carboxylation of pyr to oaa and thus also carries the anaplerotic flux. the carbon flux distributions at the pyruvate branching point were similar in fully aerobic conditions and in  <dig> % oxygen . slightly lower fluxes through pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate carboxylase were observed in  <dig> % oxygen than in  <dig> % oxygen corresponding to the higher carbon flux through pyruvate decarboxylase, which reflected the production of ethanol. in conditions receiving less than  <dig> % oxygen the carbon fluxes were redistributed at the pyruvate branching point and fermentative fluxes became dominating. in  <dig> % oxygen the major carbon flux  from the pyruvate branching point was directed through pyruvate decarboxylase. the corresponding value in  <dig> % oxygen was on average 77%. in  <dig> % oxygen the fraction of carbon flux through pyruvate dehydrogenase  was less than half that observed in fully aerobic conditions , while the fraction of carbon flux through pyruvate carboxylase was 15% compared to 29% in fully aerobic conditions. in anaerobic conditions 94% of the carbon flux from the pyruvate branching point was directed through pyruvate decarboxylase, while pyruvate dehydrogenase flux contributed only 2% of the total flux .

tca cycle fluxes
low net tca cycle fluxes were observed in low oxygen concentrations.  <dig> % oxygen in the chemostat inlet gas was enough to maintain the net tca cycle flux at a level almost as high as in the fully aerobic conditions, but progressively lower fluxes were observed when less oxygen was provided . limitation in oxygen availability reduced the respirative carbon flux through the tca cycle, the net flux from oga through the tca cycle to oaamit , whereas the specific biosynthetic flux from the tca cycle remained constant . in fully aerobic conditions the respirative carbon flux from oga was 84% of the net flux and even in  <dig> % oxygen the respirative carbon flux was the major fraction of the net carbon flux in the tca cycle  .

in anaerobic conditions, the c2–c <dig> fragments in pep, oaacyt and oaamit had equal labelling patterns, as deduced from the corresponding amino acid labelling patterns . thus, anaplerotic flux was the only source of oaamit  and the tca cycle operated as a branched pathway, with oxidative and reductive branches, instead of as a cycle  <cit> . the equal fractions of intact c2–c <dig> fragments in pep, oaacyt and oaamit result in unresolved flux ratios at the metabolic branching points of pep, oaacyt and pyrmit. therefore, the metabolic network model was simplified by neglecting the pepck activity and resolving only the net transfer of oaa across the mitochondrial membrane at the oaa branching point. the contribution of malic enzyme flux to the pyrmit pool could not be quantified in anaerobic conditions, because the carbon fragments from the malic enzyme flux would have the same labelling pattern as the carbon fragments originating from pyrcyt. however, when  <dig> % oxygen was provided, no contribution for malic enzyme flux could be observed. in anaerobic conditions, symmetrisation of oaa as the result of reversible exchange with fumarate was observed, but this label-scrambling flux could not be quantified with the current experimental set up. the labelling pattern of oaamit could only be partly determined from the amino acids, in which the carbon backbone originates from oga .

energy metabolism
in anaerobic conditions, where no aerobic respiration is taking place, atp is generated solely through substrate level phosphorylations. fermentation allows redox neutral anaerobic atp generation when acetaldehyde acts as an electron acceptor for nadh. the biosynthetic atp requirement per biomass unit was estimated from the anaerobic atp generating and consuming net fluxes. the specific biosynthetic atp requirements were assumed to be constant in all oxygenation conditions, since biomass composition was assumed to be constant, as indicated in previous experimental observations which showed essentially the same biomass composition in the two extreme conditions, i.e. in fully aerobic and in anaerobic conditions  <cit> . atp generation through substrate level phosphorylations was calculated from the reaction stoichiometry and the net flux data. the rest of the atp demand was assumed to be provided by respirative atp generation. the fraction of atp generated through respiration to meet the atp demand was 59% in fully aerobic conditions and decreased with decreasing oxygenation, as ethanol production increased . in  <dig> % oxygen, 25% of the atp was still generated through respiration.

the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation in different levels of oxygen was assessed by determining the p/o ratios in the different conditions. by neglecting the fraction of oxygen consumed in pathways other than respiration  <cit> , p/o ratios were estimated from the measured ours and the estimated amount of atp generated through respiration . the p/o ratios were also estimated from the electron flux to the respiratory chain and the estimated atp generation through respiration. assimilatory nadh generation was estimated from the anaerobic glycerol production rate, assuming that nadh generation in biosynthetic reactions was constant per g cdw- <dig> in all conditions. the generation of electron donors, nadh and fadh <dig>  in central carbon metabolism was determined from the net flux data. as nadh and fadh <dig> are energetically equivalent in yeast, the estimated total electron flux to the respiratory chain was calculated from the summed generation of electron donors. the two estimates for p/o ratios were close to one in all the conditions.

transcriptional regulation of metabolic enzymes
results from transcript analysis with the aid of affinity capture  of s. cerevisiae in the different oxygenation conditions are presented in wiebe et al.   <cit> . genes encoding enzymes of central carbon metabolism were mapped to the corresponding fluxes in the metabolic network model using the saccharomyces genome database  <cit>  and pearson correlation coefficients were calculated between the transcription levels of genes encoding metabolic enzymes and the fluxes through the enzymes in the different conditions. positive correlation  between the transcriptional levels  <cit>  and the corresponding fluxes in the different oxygenation conditions was found only in the respirative pathway, i.e. in pyruvate dehydrogenase and in the tca cycle .

discussion
the dependence of the intracellular metabolic flux distribution of s. cerevisiae cen.pk113-1a on the external oxygen availability was studied in glucose-limited chemostats under five different oxygenation conditions with 13c-labelling. 13c-labelling was utilised to obtain ratios of intracellular fluxes at the metabolic branching points  <cit> . the flux ratio constraints were included in the mfa systems to solve the metabolic flux distributions  <cit> . the redox cofactors nadh and nadph were not included in the metabolite mass balancing in 13c-mfa so that the intracellular flux distributions could be reliably solved, despite the lack of precise information on the cofactor specificities and the relative activities of different isoenzymes for conditions in which redox balancing is an important determinant of cell physiology, in particular metabolic fluxes. the dilution rate in the chemostat cultivations,  <dig>  h- <dig>  was well below the μmax observed for the equivalent strain cen.pk113-7d:  <dig>  h- <dig> and  <dig>  h- <dig> in aerobic and anaerobic conditions  <cit> , respectively, and significantly lower than the critical dilution rate  <dig>  h- <dig>  at which the metabolism of s. cerevisiae  has been reported to shift from fully respirative to respiro-fermentative in aerobic chemostat cultures  <cit> . the entirely respirative metabolism of s. cerevisiae under fully aerobic conditions was further confirmed by the absence of ethanol and other fermentation products in the culture supernatant and approximately the same specific rates of o <dig> consumption and co <dig> production . the controlled continuous culture conditions ensured that the metabolic effects observed under conditions of restricted respiration in the current study stemmed solely from the reduced availability of oxygen, rather than from exceeding the respiratory capacity, which has been observed to result in overflow metabolism, in aerobic alcoholic fermentation at high specific growth rate  <cit> .

the switch from entirely respirative metabolism to respiro-fermentative metabolism was observed in conditions of  <dig> % oxygen in the chemostat inlet gas. however, in  <dig> % oxygen the respirative pathways still carried most of the carbon fluxes. when the oxygen provision was further restricted to  <dig> %, thus reducing the potential of respirative atp production, flux through the fermentative pathway increased. since mitochondrial respiration is a significantly more efficient means to produce atp than substrate level phosphorylations, even in only  <dig> % oxygen a significant fraction  of atp was produced through respiration.

major redistributions of carbon fluxes were observed between the different oxygenation conditions, particularly at the pyruvate branch point where the metabolism branches to three pathways. the respirative and the fermentative pathways branch out from pyruvate through the enzymes pyruvate dehydrogenase and pyruvate decarboxylase, respectively. pyruvate decarboxylase has been found to be essential for growth on glucose in s. cerevisiae because of the assimilatory role of the pathway in generation of cytosolic acetyl-coa. it is therefore also expressed during respiratory growth  <cit> . wiebe et al.  observed decreased expression of the pyruvate decarboxylase pdc <dig> gene in low oxygenation  <cit>  although the flux redistribution at the pyruvate branch point demonstrated that higher flux was directed through pyruvate decarboxylase in low than in high external oxygen, suggesting that post-transcriptional regulation is important for pyruvate decarboxylase. in  <dig> % oxygen the fermentative flux through pyruvate decarboxylase became the main carbon flux from the pyruvate branch point.

under glucose repression the respiratory pathway enzymes are severely down-regulated  <cit>  whereas under low external oxygen availability the respiratory chain is functional but the terminal electron acceptor, oxygen, is limiting. the electron transport chain may even be optimized for low oxygen conditions by oxygen dependent modification of the terminal electron acceptor cox subunits cox5a and cox5b via transcriptional regulation  <cit> . the genes encoding tca cycle enzymes are down-regulated in low oxygenation  <cit> . the carbon fluxes in the tca cycle were also lower in lower oxygenation. in anaerobic conditions the tca cycle operated as a branched pathway, as previously observed by fiaux et al.   <cit>  and in aerobic glucose repressed batch cultures by gombert et al.   <cit> . on the contrary maaheimo et al.   <cit>  observed cyclic operation of the tca cycle in aerobic batch cultures and branched operation only in anaerobic batch cultures. in mammals pyruvate dehydrogenase can be regulated via hif <dig> mediated phosphorylation to reduce the flux to the tca cycle under restricted respiration  <cit> . however, the activity of the s. cerevisiae pyruvate dehydrogenase enzyme has not been found to be regulated by phosphorylation  <cit> .

the third flux branching from pyruvate, the anaplerotic flux, through pyruvate carboxylase, replaces the carbons lost from the tca cycle to biosynthesis. an increase in the anaplerotic flux can be expected when the ratio of the carbon flow to biosynthesis, relative to the respirative carbon flux through the tca cycle, is increased. when the respiration rate was reduced by the reduced availability of external oxygen while the growth rate was kept constant, the respirative carbon flux was decreased whereas the specific carbon flux to biosynthesis remained the same. in  <dig> % oxygen the respirative carbon flux was still over 60% of the net carbon flux to the tca cycle whereas in anaerobic conditions there was no respirative carbon flux and the anaplerotic flux was the only source of oaamit. frick and wittmann  observed considerably increased anaplerotic fluxes in s. cerevisiae at high growth rates  in aerobic chemostats compared to low growth rate  and the increases in the anaplerotic fluxes were accompanied by high malic enzyme fluxes  <cit> . high contribution of a malic enzyme flux has also been observed in aerobic glucose-repressed batch cultures  <cit> . in this study the highest, but still low, malic enzyme fluxes were observed in the more oxygenised conditions while the absolute anaplerotic flux remained on fairly constant level and only the ratio of anaplerosis to the tca cycle flux was increased when oxygen concentration was reduced. thus a high ratio of anaplerotic flux to the tca cycle flux is associated with respiro-fermentative and anaerobic metabolism, but high absolute anaplerotic and malic enzyme fluxes with high specific growth rate and/or overflow metabolism. overflow metabolism was not observed as a result of decreased respiratory rate achieved by reduced oxygen provision.

in fully aerobic conditions s. cerevisiae regenerates nad+ mainly through respiration. when limited oxygen availability restricts respiration, cells are forced to use other means for regeneration of nad+and mitochondrial nadh needs to be transported to the cytosol for reoxidisation. for the transport of nadh, mitochondrial alcohol dehydrogenase, encoded by adh <dig>  provides a probable redox shuttle  <cit> . s. cerevisiae oxidises the surplus nadh by producing glycerol as a redox sink. in this study, carbon loss to glycerol was observed only in anaerobic conditions, as expected. based on the theoretical amount of assimilatory nadh synthesised in anaerobic conditions,  <dig> mmol g biomass- <dig> at a growth rate  <dig>  h- <dig>  <cit> , which was consistent with the anaerobic glycerol production rate observed in this study  but the glycerol-3-phosphate shuttle is also known to be active  <cit> . the anaerobic flux distribution observed was clearly different from all the other flux distributions since respiration could maintain the nadh/nad+ ratio in all the aerobic conditions. weusthuis et al.  indicated that yeasts could optimise their function for redox balancing so that available oxygen would primarily be used to maintain the redox balance, thus avoiding carbon loss to glycerol  <cit> . the indication has been supported by mfa modelling results of s. cerevisiae metabolism in low oxygen conditions  <cit> . respiratory functions couple energy generation in terms of atp with the redox balance. since the redox cofactor nadh is one of the hub metabolites in the organism-wide network of metabolic reactions  <cit> , the regulation of redox homeostasis encompasses all the metabolic pathways.

in this study p/o ratios were estimated in two different ways: from ours and from the flux of electrons to the respiratory chain. the two different estimates were consistent with each other and close to one in all conditions. the effective p/o ratio has previously been estimated to be close to one in respiratory, carbon-limited cultures  <cit>  and an increase in the effective p/o ratio in decreased respiratory fluxes has been observed in isolated mitochondria and in spheroplasts  <cit> . an ability to adjust the p/o ratio has been discussed as providing an important means to control atp synthesis in cells to adapt to changes in energy demands  <cit> . in this study no significant increase in the p/o ratio was observed with decreasing respiratory fluxes.

the ppp provides precursors for biosynthesis and reductive power in the form of nadph. the relative flux to the ppp appeared to be mainly determined by the nadph requirement for biomass synthesis in the different oxygenation conditions. it has been stated that the flux through the ppp depends on the nadp+/nadph ratio in the cell and additionally on the mgatp2- pool that inhibits glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme in the oxidative branch of the ppp, allowing dynamic regulation of the relative ppp flux  <cit> . the dependence of the relative ppp flux on growth rate and biomass yield has been observed  <cit> . the relative ppp flux contributions to pep observed with metafor analysis of glucose repressed cells in aerobic batch cultures  <cit>  are essentially the same as observed in this study in response to the lowest oxygen provision and anaerobic conditions. nadph production of the oxidative ppp in the aerobic cultivations was approximately  <dig> mmol g biomass- <dig> in this study, assuming the maximum relative ppp flux, while approximately  <dig> mmol g biomass- <dig> would be needed for reducing power in the form of nadph for biomass production of yeast growing on glucose with ammonium as the nitrogen source  <cit> . thus one third of the nadph required must have been produced in pathways other than the ppp. the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction of the tca cycle is assumed to be another main contributor to the production of nadph  <cit> . however, nadph is also known to be an important factor in oxidative damage prevention  <cit>  and therefore the nadph requirement may have been lower in the lower oxygenation conditions.

the changes in metabolic flux distribution observed in the series of different oxygenation conditions were positively correlated with the transcriptional changes of the genes encoding the flux carrying metabolic enzymes  <cit>  only for pyruvate dehydrogenase and the tca cycle. glycolytic flux, in particular, showed a large increase as oxygenation was reduced, in contrast to the expression levels of some of the corresponding genes  <cit> . however, no extensive correlation between changes in transcription and the flux distribution in aerobic and anaerobic chemostat cultures of s. cerevisiae has been previously observed  <cit>  and the glycolytic enzymes have recently been stated to be post-transcriptionally regulated  <cit> . in contrast, some transcriptional regulation of metabolism has been found to correlate with the glycolytic rate in batch cultures of s. cerevisiae strains displaying glucose uptake rates between  <dig>  mmol g- <dig> h- <dig> and  <dig>  mmol g- <dig> h- <dig> by elbing et al.   <cit> . in this study, even though the specific glucose uptake rates in chemostats varied between  <dig>  mmol g- <dig> h- <dig> and  <dig>  mmol g- <dig> h- <dig>  <cit>  there was no correlation with the transcriptional level of the glycolytic genes which were studied. however, in the work by elbing et al. , how the glycolytic rate was sensed to trigger transcriptional changes was not resolved  <cit> . as extensive oxygen dependent redistributions of fluxes were observed in central carbon metabolism in this work, the oxygen-dependent regulation of the fluxes in s. cerevisiae appears to lie mainly at the post-transcriptional level of the cell's regulatory system. however, it should be kept in mind that the oxygen dependent flux distributions of s. cerevisiae reflect not only the direct oxygen sensing regulatory mechanisms, but rather the ultimate response of the whole interactive multi-level regulatory system.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study the quantification of the flux distributions of s. cerevisiae in response to different oxygenation conditions with 13c-mfa showed that the fluxes were redistributed not only between the cells grown in the fully aerobic conditions, in conditions of reduced oxygen provision and in anaerobic conditions but also for cells grown with  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % oxygen. although the cellular metabolism was respiro-fermentative in each of these low oxygen conditions, the actual amount of oxygen available resulted in different contributions through respirative and fermentative pathways. the flux distribution at the pyruvate branch point, leading to respirative and fermentative pathways and to anaplerotic flux replenishing the tca cycle, was particularly responsive to the level of reduction in oxygen provision. the oxygen-dependent regulation of the flux distribution in central carbon metabolism of s. cerevisiae appeared to lie mainly at the post-transcriptional level of the cell's regulatory system. respirative pathway flux decreased progressively in reduced oxygenation conditions where the availability of terminal electron acceptor limited the respiratory rate. however, respiratory energy generation, being very efficient, provided a large fraction of the atp required even in low oxygen conditions.
