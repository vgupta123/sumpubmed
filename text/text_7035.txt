BACKGROUND
clostridium botulinum, and certain other clostridium spp., secrete seven serotypes  of botulinum neurotoxins . three bonts  are mainly responsible for human botulism, a disease occurring naturally, in the form of food poisoning. botulism is also part of the a list of the six diseases at the highest risk of being caused by bioweapons, according to the center for disease control  <cit> . botulinum toxin a  is regarded as the most toxic substance on earth and its ld <dig> values are  <dig> ng/kg for the intravenous and subcutaneous routes, and  <dig> ng/kg by pulmonary route  <cit> . botulinum toxins exert their toxicity by cleaving proteins that constitute the intraneuronal snare  complex, which allows cholinergic vesicles to bind the pre-synaptic membrane of neuromuscular synapses and release their content. in particular, bont/a cleaves snap- <dig> , due to a zinc metalloprotease activity borne by its light chain . this proteolysis inhibits snare activity and causes flaccid paralysis, including that of respiratory muscles. despite botulinum lethality, vaccination against botulinum toxins is questionable because it would prevent the ever-increasing medical uses of bonts . at present, treatment against botulism consists of supportive care and passive immunization with equine antitoxin  <cit> , which may however cause hypersensitivity and serum sickness  <cit> . to avoid these side effects and increase their half-life, particularly for prophylactic use, well-tolerated antibodies are needed. these may be represented by recombinant antibodies.

antibodies neutralizing botulinum toxins generally target the heavy chains of these toxins, inhibiting toxin entry into cells  <cit> . recently however and for the first time, an antibody directed against the light chain of botulinum a , the human igg 4lca isolated by hybridoma technology, was shown to neutralize the proteolytic activity of bont/a in vitro and exhibited protective activity in vivo. moreover, when 4lca was administered in conjunction with an antibody directed against the heavy chain, both acted synergistically and showed increased protective capacities  <cit> . a llama antibody also inhibiting bont/a-lc enzymatic activity was presented even more recently, and its epitope was mapped to support the design of synthetic inhibitors  <cit> . in the present study, we describe the isolation of a human-like recombinant scfv inhibiting bont/a endopeptidase activity in vitro, in the perspective of its clinical development.

in previous studies, we have used immune phage-displayed libraries originating from macaques  to isolate antibody fragments of nanomolar or picomolar affinities against tetanus toxin  <cit> , the two units of anthrax lethal toxin  <cit> , ricin  <cit> , and against a surface antigen of aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . the choice of non-human primates  is based on the phylogenetic proximity between nhps and humans. this choice allows the isolation of fragments with human-like character, thus augmenting their therapeutic value. at a later stage, the best nhp antibody fragments might be germline-humanized to obtain antibody fragments with a higher percentage of identity with human germline sequences than antibody fragments of human origin, thus potentially better tolerated  <cit> . another potential advantage of our strategy is that we choose animals from which, prior to the immunization, no dna encoding antibody fragments are amplified so that the library is not directed against non-relevant antigens, but rather exquisitely focused on the immunogen. from this "zero" point, the immunization is conducted until a high titer is reached and can not be increased with additional immunizations. such a response is defined as hyper-immune  <cit>  and may span over most, or all, epitopes with high-affinity antibodies. because hyper-immune nhps are used for the construction of our libraries, we have argued that they could be referred to as "hyper-immune libraries"  <cit> . in the present study, the strategy of utilizing a hyper-immune nhp library was chosen again. diversity of the scfvs constituting this library was however limited by the frequent presence of ncoi and hind iii restriction sites within the genes encoding scfvs and utilized for library construction. after multi-step panning, phages displaying incomplete scfvs overwhelmed the library. a single-round of panning with high stringency was more successful and several full-sized scfvs were isolated, whose human-like character was quantified. one of these scfvs inhibited the endopeptidase activity of bont/a and may be proposed for clinical development. this study exemplifies again the potential of our strategy, and indicates how to solve difficulties similar to the problem encountered here.

RESULTS
animal immunization, phage-displayed library construction
the immunization utilized the non-toxic light chain of botulinum a <dig>  as immunogen, but the response was evaluated with an elisa utilizing the whole toxin  as capture antigen because bont/a <dig> better represents the agent to be neutralized in clinical use. ten days after the third injection, the elisa titer was measured as 1/ <dig>  <dig> and was anticipated to correspond to an hyper-immune response. a fourth injection was given to the macaque eight months after the third one and, just before this, fourth injection, no pcr products could be amplified from the bone marrow. at the sixth and tenth days after this fourth injection however, the amplification of genes coding vh and vl was very effective with all primers, and then the quantity of the amplified products decreased. on the tenth day, the titer was measured again as 1/ <dig>  <dig>  confirming that a stable, hyper-immune, response had been reached. the genes encoding vh and vl which had been amplified during the sixth and tenth days were regarded as optimal. they were pooled and cloned in pgemt for the construction of κ light chains and fd sublibraries of  <dig> and  <dig> ×  <dig> clones, respectively. next, the scfv library was constructed in phal <dig> by two consecutive cloning steps, starting with the vl gene fragments and followed by the vh fragments. the final scfv antibody gene library consisted of  <dig>  ×  <dig> independent clones, but with only 37% full size inserts as determined by colony pcr. twenty clones of the library were sequenced prior to screening, and the blast analysis  of these sequences revealed that only seven of them corresponded to full-sized scfvs. partial sequences corresponded to internal ncoi restriction sites in  <dig> of  <dig> vh gene fragments, plus a hindiii restriction site on one. the existence of partial vh gene fragments, possibly corresponding to recombination in  <dig> occurrences , was also observed. despite this low rate of full-sized inserts , the immune library was packaged.

isolation of scfvs directed against bont/a1
a single round of panning followed by forty washes, was performed and resulted in the isolation of  <dig>  ×  <dig> clones. randomly chosen,  <dig> individual clones were grown in sb medium, and culture supernatants were tested for binding to bont/a <dig> by elisa. thirty nine positive clones expressing scfvs reacting with bont/a <dig> were isolated and the corresponding dna was sequenced. these  <dig> clones corresponded to  <dig> non-redundant, full-sized scfvs.

affinity measurement
from the  <dig> clones selected previously,  <dig> scfvs were efficiently expressed and purified before measuring their affinities for bont/a. these scfvs had nanomolar affinities, from  <dig>  nm  to  <dig>  nm  , with an average value of  <dig>  nm.

affinities of the ten scfvs reacting with bont/a <dig> as measured by biacore.

computational analysis
analysis of the genes encoding the  <dig> scfvs indicated a high diversity of the vh sequences, despite the loss of diversity due to panning and presence of the ncoi and hindiii sites. all ighv genes were represented, except for ighv <dig>  combined with representatives of all ighd genes except for ighd <dig> . these genes were only combined with representatives of ighj <dig> and ighj <dig> but, as these genes only encode the last part of cdr <dig> and fr <dig>  this limited diversity of the j genes was not expected to severely impact diversity of the vh paratopes. diversity of the vl part of the paratope was however smaller with only igkv <dig> being represented but for one occurrence of igkv <dig> and one occurrence of igkv <dig>  igkj <dig> was dominant, again limiting vl diversity, except for two occurrences of igkj <dig> and two occurrences of igkj <dig>  the germinality index , indicating percent identity between framework regions  of the selected scfvs and those coded by their most similar human germline genes, was calculated. it was averaged on vh and vl for each scfv and ranged from 82% to 88% . the g-scores, another indirect way to predict tolerance but based on a comparison with somatic  genes, ranged from - <dig>  to  <dig>  .

human germline genes most similar to the genes coding for the  <dig> selected scfvs were retrieved by imgt /domaingapalign. the germinality index  of each scfv  is indicated in the right column.

the human-like character of the  <dig> selected scfvs was evaluated through the calculation of g-scores, to indirectly predict their immunogenicity.

enzymatic assays
in a preliminary assay, 2h <dig> was the only scfv to present a distinct level of endopeptidase inhibition while all other clones showed almost no inhibition of proteolysis, comparable to that of the negative controls, scfvs 43rca and 38rca directed against ricin. consequently, 2h <dig> was more precisely evaluated for its inhibition capacity  in a second experiment, in which a concentration of 2h <dig> equal to  <dig>  μg/ml  inhibited 50% of the endopeptidase activity of  <dig>  pg/ml of bont/a <dig> . inhibition of 50% of the endopeptidase activity thus corresponded to a molar ratio of antigen binding sites/antigen  of  <dig> : <dig> .

discussion
botulinum toxins  are the most poisonous substances on earth, and botulinum neurotoxin a  is the most potent. in a broad study, sixty six genes encoding bont/a were studied  <cit>  and subtype  <dig> was encountered on  <dig> occurrences, with the remaining strains scattered among  <dig> other subtypes. this study thus focused on the most prevalent bont/a subtype, a <dig>  we targeted its light chain  because several antibodies targeting the heavy chain, and inhibiting toxin entry into cells, have already been isolated  <cit> . the description of bont/a neutralization by targeting bont/a-l and inhibiting its endopeptidase activity is fairly recent, and to date only one human  and one llama  antibody with this capacity have been isolated  <cit> . in confocal microscopy, signals corresponding to 4lca co-localized in cells with signals corresponding to bont/a, representing direct evidence that 4lca did not act by preventing bont/a internalization and that 4lca was internalized for neutralization  <cit> . also, the structure of aa <dig> complexed with bont/a-l, and the epitope of aa <dig> on bont/a-l, was determined by crystallography  <cit> . inhibition of endopeptidase activity by antibodies directed against the light chain of bont/a is thus thought to mainly depend on their direct interaction, initiated outside of the cells but persisting within. such a mechanism of inhibition has the advantage that it may be activated after entry of the toxin in the cells so that antibodies with this activity might be proposed for re-formatting as transbodies or intrabodies  <cit> , which would enter cells even if not complexed with the toxin and thus would be usable after a longer delay than antibodies that prevent toxin cell entry. in addition, one may anticipate that an antibody inhibiting endopeptidase activity may also have other protective mechanisms in vivo, such as promoting toxin clearance by recruitment of immune effectors  <cit> . for these reasons, it was decided to isolate an antibody fragment inhibiting bont/a1-l endopeptidase activity, in anticipation of its protective capacity and potential clinical development.

the present library was constructed as previously described  <cit>  to yield high affinity-scfvs  <cit>  due to its hyper-immune nature  <cit> , corresponding to the hyper-immune response from which this library was built. non-toxic bont/a1-l was utilized for immunization but complete bont/a <dig> was preferred as antigen for elisas, panning, affinity measurements and endopeptidase assay as the present study aimed at isolating scfvs that bind to bont/a1-l but as part of bont/a <dig>  the toxin to be neutralized. after library construction however, internal controls showed an unusually low rate of inserts , which was confirmed by sequencing as almost half  of inserts presented an internal ncoi restriction site. an hindiii internal restriction site was also observed, plus partial sequences probably caused by recombination, so that only 35%  of scfv sequences were full-length. former macaque immune libraries  <cit>  did not exhibit this rate of partial vh gene fragments as apparently, a higher rate of vh gene fragments with ncoi restriction sites was employed by the immune response against bont/a1-l compared to all former immunizations. notwithstanding, the constructed library was screened using a traditional protocol consisting of successive rounds of panning, with increasing stringency due to an increasing number of washing steps between rounds. after the first round, with  <dig> washing steps, the presence of full-sized inserts further decreased. this decrease was due to the library being overwhelmed by plasmids carrying partial-sized inserts or no insert at all, which replicate more rapidly and this preferred replication had not been counterbalanced by the selection applied during the first round of panning. after the second round, with  <dig> washing steps, scfvs with partially- and full-sized inserts were completely lost and the panning was thus unsuccessful. however, it was anticipated that nhp hyper-immune libraries do not absolutely need multi-step panning, in contrast to naïve libraries where scfvs of interest are rare, so that it was decided to adapt the panning strategy and use only a single round of panning, similar to other studies  <cit> . a high stringency, in the form of  <dig> washes, was chosen for this single round because it was required to counterbalance the preferred replication of phages with incomplete, or no, scfvs. also, it was expected that scfvs of interest, present in the library, would have a high affinity and thus would be retained even after  <dig> washing steps. this single-round panning allowed the elution of clones, of which two hundred and eighty eight were randomly hand-picked and small-scale expression of scfvs was induced. the supernatants were tested in elisa for their reactivity against bont/a <dig> and thirty nine scfvs were rated as positive. the numerous negative supernatants could correspond to plasmids carrying no or partial inserts and again beginning to overwhelm the library, to scfvs with weak affinities or to scfvs having a low expression level in this format. after sequencing these thirty nine positive clones, fourteen full-sized, non redundant scfvs were isolated. of these fourteen, ten were expressed and purified in quantities sufficient for further evaluation. the sequencing of these ten scfvs showed a high level of diversity, most particularly in the vh region. given that diversity, it was expected that these ten scfvs might target different epitopes and perhaps inhibit endopeptidase activity. this was the case for only one of them, 2h <dig>  which bound the bont/a <dig> holotoxin with high affinity  and inhibited snap <dig> cleavage. the inhibition capacity of 2h <dig> might be compared to that of the only two antibodies with similar activities, previously published. the molar ratio of antibody to toxin , at which 50% inhibition of endopeptidase activity is observed, is the best parameter to evaluate an inhibiting activity as this ratio is independent of toxin and antibody quantities utilized in the test. in a previous study, the igg 4lca was tested in an in vitro endopeptidase assay but at a single dose, allowing 63% reduction of bont/a endopeptidase activity  <cit> . this dose corresponded to a  <dig> : <dig> molar ratio , which is comparable to the  <dig> : <dig> molar ratio observed when 2h <dig> inhibited 50% of the bont/a endopeptidase activity. in effect, scfv 2h <dig> has a smaller steric hindrance than an igg thus the expression of 2h <dig> as an igg should lower that ratio. in another study, the llama antibody aa <dig> inhibited 50% of bont/a-l endopeptidase activity at a 200: <dig> molar ratio   <cit> . however, it should be noted that aa <dig> was tested only against the bont/a light chain  and not the whole toxin. in the view of clinical development, such a test is less realistic than an evaluation utilizing bont/a, as was performed with 4lca and with 2h <dig> 

the g-score of a variable domain  characterizes the human-like character, or humanness, of this domain. assuming a high level of humaness corresponds to a high degree of tolerance in clinical use, as is generally accepted  <cit> , the g-score parameter indirectly predicts tolerance of the variable domains it characterizes. here, the g-score of 2h <dig> vl  corresponds to a vl that is "as human"  as 19% of the human vls present in the kabat database. similarly, its vh, with a g-score equal to - <dig> , is "as human"  as 29% of human vhs. for both v-regions, these similarities testify for the human-like character of 2h <dig> and predict good tolerance in clinical use. another way to evaluate the immunogenicity of 2h <dig> is to calculate the identity level of its frs with its most similar, human, germline-encoded frs. this identity level, also called germinality index   <cit> , indirectly predicts the tolerance of any given vh or vl sequence based on the theoretical assumption that germline-encoded sequences are best tolerated, as they are part of the "immunological self". the gi value of 2h <dig> is equal to 88%, thus high. for instance, this value is identical to the gi value of another macaque antibody fragment, 35pa <dig>  <cit> , which was germline-humanized up to a gi of  <dig> %  <cit> . this last gi value corresponded to only four macaque residues that had to be left after the humanization process, with the rest of the frs encoded by germline genes. only two of these four residues were exposed to solvent, and thus unlikely to raise any immune response in humans. based on the gi identity of 2h <dig> with 35pa <dig>  success of germline-humanization of 2h <dig> may be anticipated. overall, the sequence analysis of 2h <dig> by g-score and gi quantifies the human-like character of 2h <dig>  and predicts its good tolerance. to suppress any risk of immunogenicity however, germline-humanization of 2h <dig> is recommended as it should be as successful as a germline-humanization, presented formerly  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, scfv 2h <dig>  directed against the light chain of botulinum toxin a, was isolated. it presented an inhibition capacity and human-like qualities required for clinical development. scfv 2h <dig> was isolated despite the presence of restriction sites utilized for library construction within the genes encoding the scfv intended to be part of the library, using an adapted single-round panning strategy. this result exemplifies the efficiency of phage-displayed libraries built from immunized non-human primate to isolate antibody fragments with therapeutic potential.
