BACKGROUND
with the development of high throughput technologies, such as microarray and next generation sequencing data, the exploration of high throughput data sets is becoming a necessity to unveil the relevant information contained in the data. efficient exploratory tools are therefore needed, not only to assess the quality of the data, but also to give a comprehensive overview of the system, extract significant information and cope with the high dimensionality. indeed, many statistical approaches fail or perform poorly for two main reasons: the number of samples  is much smaller than the number of variables  and the data are extremely noisy.

in this study, we are interested in the application of unsupervised approaches to discover novel biological mechanisms and reveal insightful patterns while reducing the dimension in the data. amongst the different categories of unsupervised approaches , we are specifically interested in projection-based methods, which linearly decompose the data into components with a desired property. these exploratory approaches project the data into a new subspace spanned by the components. they allow dimension reduction without loss of essential information and visualization of the data in a smaller subspace.

principal component analysis   <cit>  is a classical tool to reduce the dimension of expression data, to visualize the similarities between the biological samples, and to filter noise. it is often used as a pre-processing step for subsequent analyses. pca projects the data into a new space spanned by the principal components , which are uncorrelated and orthogonal. the pcs can successfully extract relevant information in the data. through sample and variable representations, they can reveal experimental characteristics, as well as artefacts or bias. sometimes, however, pca can fail to accurately reflect our knowledge of biology for the following reasons: a) pca assumes that gene expression follows a multivariate normal distribution and recent studies have demonstrated that microarray gene expression measurements follow instead a super-gaussian distribution  <cit> , b) pca decomposes the data based on the maximization of its variance. in some cases, the biological question may not be related to the highest variance in the data  <cit> .

a more plausible assumption of the underlying distribution of high-throughput biological data is that feature measurements following gaussian distributions represent noise - most genes conform to this distribution as they are not expected to change at a given physiological or pathological transition  <cit> . recently, an alternative approach called independent component analysis   <cit>  has been introduced to analyze microrray and metabolomics data  <cit> . in contrary to pca, ica identifies non-gaussian components which are modelled as a linear combination of the biological features. these components are statistically independent, i.e. there is no overlapping information between the components. ica therefore involves high order statistics, while pca constrains the components to be mutually orthogonal, which involves second order statistics  <cit> . as a result, pca and ica often choose different subspaces where the data are projected. as ica is a blind source signal separation, it is used to reduce the effects of noise or artefacts of the signal since usually, noise is generated from independent sources  <cit> . in the recent literature, it has been shown that the independent components from ica were better at separating different biological groups than the principal components from pca  <cit> . however, although ica has been found to be a successful alternative to pca, it faces some limitations due to some instability, the choice of number of components to extract and high dimensionality. as ica is a stochastic algorithm, it needs to be run several times and the results averaged in order to obtain robust results  <cit> . the number of independent component to extract and choose is a hard outstanding problem. it has been the convention to use a fixed number of components  <cit> . however, ica does not order its components by 'relevance'. therefore, some authors proposed to order them either with respect to their kurtosis values  <cit> , or with respect to their l <dig> norm  <cit> , or by using bayesian frameworks to select the number of components  <cit> . in the case of high dimensional data sets, pca is often applied as a pre-processing step to reduce the number of dimensions  <cit> . in that particular case, ica is applied on a subset of data summarized by a small number of principal components from pca.

in this paper, we propose to use ica as a denoising process of pca, since ica is good at separating mixed signals, i.e. noise vs. no noise. the aim is to generate denoised loading vectors. these vectors are crucial in pca or ica as each of them indicates the weights assigned to each biological feature in the linear combination that leads to the component. therefore, the goal is to obtain independent components that better reflect the underlying biology in a study and achieve better dimension reduction than pca or ica.

independent principal component analysis  makes the assumption that biologically meaningful components can be obtained if most noise has been removed in the associated loading vectors.

in ipca, pca is used as a pre-processing step to reduce the dimension of the data and to generate the loading vectors. the fastica algorithm  <cit>  is then applied on the previously obtained pca loading vectors that will subsequently generate the independent principal components . we use the kurtosis measure of the loading vectors to order the ipcs. we also propose a sparse variant with a built-in variable selection procedure by applying soft-thresholding on the independent loading vectors  <cit>  .

in the 'results and discussion' section, we first compare the classical pca and ica methodologies to ipca on a simulation study. on three real biological datasets  we demonstrate the satisfying samples clustering abilities of ipca. we then illustrate the usefulness of variable selection with sipca and compare it with the results obtained from the sparse pca from  <cit> . in the 'methods' section, we present the pca, ica and ipca methodologies and describe how to perform variable selection with sipca.

RESULTS
we first performed a simulation study where the loading vectors follow a gaussian or super-gaussian distribution. on three real data sets, we compared the kurtosis values of the loading vectors as a way of measuring their non-gaussianity and ordering the ipcs. the samples clustering ability of each approach is assessed using the davies bouldin index  <cit> . finally, the variable selection performed by sipca and spca are compared on a simulated as well as on the liver toxicity data sets.

simulation study
in order to understand the benefits of ipca compared to pca or ica, we simulated  <dig> data sets of size n =  <dig> samples and p =  <dig> variables from a multivariate normal distribution with a pre-specified variance-covariance matrix described in the 'methods' section. two cases were tested.

 <dig>  gaussian case. the first two eigenvectors v <dig> and v <dig>  both of length  <dig>  follow a gaussian distribution.

 <dig>  super-gaussian case. in this case the first two eigenvectors follow a mixture of laplacian and uniform distributions:

 v1k~lk= <dig> …,50uotherwise,andv2k~lk= <dig> …,350uotherwise. 

tables  <dig> and  <dig> seem to suggest that ica performs poorly in both gaussian and super-gaussian case, even if we would expect quite the contrary in the super-gaussian case. in the high dimensional case, pca is used as a pre processing step in the ica algorithm. it is likely that such step affects the ica input matrix and that the ica assumptions are not met. therefore, the performance of ica seems to be largely affected by the high number of variables.

pca gave satisfactory results in both cases. in the super-gaussian case, pca is even able to recover some of the super-gaussian distribution of the loading vectors. however, ipca is able to recover the loading structure better than pca in the super-gaussian case . depending on the  nature of the data set to be analyzed, it is therefore advisable to assess both approaches.

application to real data sets
liver toxicity study
in this study,  <dig> male rats were exposed to non-toxic , moderately toxic  or severely toxic  doses of acetaminophen  in a controlled experiment  <cit> . in this paper, we considered  <dig> and  <dig> mg/kg as low doses, and  <dig> and  <dig> as high doses. necropsies were performed at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours after exposure and the mrna from the liver was extracted. the microarray data is arranged in matrix of  <dig> samples and  <dig> transcripts.

prostate cancer study
this study investigated whether gene expression differences could distinguish between common clinical and pathological features of prostate cancer. expression profiles were derived from  <dig> prostate tumors and from  <dig> non tumor prostate samples  using oligonucleotide microarrays containing probes for approximately  <dig>  genes and ests. after preprocessing remains the expression of  <dig> genes  and  <dig> samples since one normal sample was suspected to be an outlier and was removed from the analysis.

yeast metabolomic study
in this study, two saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were used - wild-type  and mutant , and were carried out in batch cultures under two different environmental conditions, aerobic  and anaerobic  in standard mineral media with glucose as the sole carbon source. after normalization and preprocessing, the metabolomic data results in  <dig> metabolites and  <dig> samples that include  <dig> mt-aer,  <dig> mt-ana,  <dig> wt-aer and  <dig> wt-ana samples .

choosing the number the components with the kurtosis measure
as mentioned by  <cit> , one major limitation of ica is the specification and the choice of the number of components to extract. in pca, the cumulative percentage of explained variance is a popular criterion to choose the number of principal components, since they are ordered by decreasing explained variance  <cit> . for the case of high dimensionality, many alternative ad hoc stopping rules have been proposed without, however, leading to a consensus . in liver toxicity, the first  <dig> principal components explained 63% of the total variance, in yeast, the first  <dig> principal components explained 85% of the total variance. for prostate that contains a very large number of variables, the first  <dig> components only explain 51% of the total variance . however, from a visualization perspective, choosing more than  <dig> components would be difficult to interpret.

the kurtosis values of the loading vectors from pca, ica and ipca are displayed in table  <dig>  these values differ from one approach to the others, as well as their order. in ipca, the kurtosis value of the associated loading vectors gives a good indicator of the ability of the components to separate the clusters, since we are interested in extracting signals from non-gaussian distributions. respectively, the first  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> components seem enough in liver toxicity, prostate and yeast to extract relevant information with ipca, as is further discussed below.

sample representation
the samples in each data set were projected in the new subspace spanned by the pca, ica or ipca components . this kind of graphical output gives a better insight into the biological study as it reveals the shared similarities between samples. the comparison between the different graphics allows to visualize how each method is able to partition the samples in a way that reflects the internal structure of the data, and to extract the relevant information to represent each sample. one would expect that the samples belonging to the same biological group, or undergoing the same biological treatment would be clustered together and separated from the other groups.

in liver toxicity, ipca tended to better cluster the low doses together, compared to pca or ica . in prostate , pca graphical representations showed interesting patterns. neither the first, nor the second component in pca were relevant to separate the two groups. instead, it was the third component that could give more insight into the expected biological characteristics of the samples. it is likely that pca first attempts to maximize the variance of noisy signals, which has a gaussian distribution, before being able to find the right direction to differentiate better the sample classes. for ipca, the first component seemed already sufficient to separate the classes , while two components were necessary for ica to achieve a satisfying clustering. for the yeast study , even though the first  <dig> principal components explained 85% of the total variance, it seemed that  <dig> components were necessary to separate wt from the mt in the aer samples with pca, whereas  <dig> components were sufficient with ica and ipca. for all approaches, the wt and mt samples for the ana group remain mixed and seem to share strong biological similarities.

cluster validation
in order to compare how well different methods perform on a data set, different indexes were proposed to measure the similarities between clusters in the literature  <cit> . we used the davies-bouldin index  <cit>  . this index has both a statistical and geometric rationale, and looks for compact and well-separated clusters. the main purpose is to check whether the different approaches can distinguish between the known biological conditions or treatments on the basis of the expression data. the approach that gives the smallest index is considered the best clustering method based on this criterion. the results are displayed in table  <dig> for a choice of  <dig> or  <dig> components. on the liver toxicity study, the davies-bouldin index indicated that ipca outperformed the other approaches using  <dig> components. when choosing  <dig> components, all approaches gave similar results. on prostate, ica slightly outperformed ipca for  <dig> components and gave similar performances for  <dig> components. pca seemed clearly limited by the large number of noisy variables and was not able to provide a satisfying clustering of the samples. ica gave good clustering performance on the yeast data set for  <dig> components, followed by pca and ipca. it is probable that there is very little noise in this small data set.

in fact, the davies-bouldin index seemed to indicate that for large data sets , ipca seems to perform best for a smaller number of components than pca. it is able to highlight relevant information in a very small number of dimensions.

variable selection
we first performed a simulation study to assess whether sipca could identify relevant variables. we then applied sipca to the liver toxicity study. in both cases, we compared sipca with the sparse pca approach  that we will subsequently call 'spca'.

simulated example
using the simulation framework described in the 'methods' section, we considered two cases:

 <dig>  gaussian case. the two sparse simulated eigenvectors followed a gaussian distribution:

 v1k~nk= <dig> …,50=0otherwise,andv2knk= <dig> …,350=0otherwise. 

 <dig>  super-gaussian case. in this case, we have

 v1k~lk= <dig> …,50=0otherwise,andv2k~lk= <dig> …,350=0otherwise. 

each eigenvector has  <dig> non-zero variables and the coefficients in the loading vectors associated to these non-zero variables follow a gaussian or super-gaussian distribution. spca and sipca were then applied on each generated data set. both approaches require the degree of sparsity, which was set to  <dig>  as an input parameter on each component. one can imagine that each eigenvector describes a particular biological process where  <dig> genes contribute heavily or very heavily to. table  <dig> displays the correct identification rate of each loading vector estimated by spca and sipca. given this non trivial setting, both approaches identified very well the important variables, especially on the first dimension, where spca slightly outperformed sipca. on the second dimension, the performance of spca and sipca differ as spca fails to differentiate each sparse signal separately - it tended to select variables from both dimensions in the second loading vector. on the contrary, and especially in the super-gaussian case, sipca is able to identify each sparse eigenvector signal separately, i.e. each simulated biological process. spca performed better in the gaussian than in the super-gaussian case, whereas sipca performed almost equally well in both cases.

real example with liver toxicity study
choosing the number of genes to select
comparison of the sparse loading vectors
the first and second sparse loading vectors for both spca and sipca are plotted in figure  <dig> . in the first dimension, the loading vectors of the two sparse approaches are very similar , a fact that was already indicated in the above simulation study. both approaches select the same variables. on the second dimension, however, the sparse loading vectors differ  as ipca  leads to an unnecessarily orthogonal basis which may reconstruct the data better than pca in the presence of noise and is sensitive to high order statistics in the data rather than the covariance matrix only  <cit> . this explains why spca and sipca give different subspaces.

sample representation
the pcs and ipcs are displayed in figure  <dig>  since most of the noisy variables were removed, spca seemed to give a better clustering of the low doses compared to figure  <dig>  sipca and ipca remain similar, which shows that ipca is well able to separate the noise from the biologically relevant signal.

biological relevance of the selected genes
we have seen that the independent principal components indicate relevant biological similarities between the samples. we next assessed whether these selected genes were relevant to the biological study. the genes selected with either sipca or spca were further investigated using the genego software  <cit> , that can output pathways, process networks, gene ontology  processes and molecular functions.

we decided to focus only on the first two dimensions as they were sufficient to obtain a satisfying cluster of the samples . we therefore analyzed the two lists of  <dig> genes selected with either sipca or spca for each of these two dimensions. amongst these  <dig> genes, between  <dig> to  <dig> genes were annotated and recognized by the software.

genes selected on dimension 1
both methods selected genes previously highlighted in the literature as having functions in detoxification and redox regulation in response to oxidative stress:  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> genes  and heme oxygenase  <dig> were selected by sipca  on the first dimension . the expression of these genes has been found to be altered in biological pathways perturbed subsequent to incipient toxicity  <cit> . these genes were also previously selected with other statistical approaches by other colleagues on the same study  <cit> .

a gene ontology enrichment analysis for each list of genes was performed. go terms significantly enriched included biological processes related to response to unfolded proteins, protein refolding and protein stimulus, as well as response to chemical stimulus and organic substance . although very similar, the spca gene list highlighted slightly more genes related to these go terms than the sipca gene selection. the go molecular functions related to these genes were, however, more enriched with sipca: heme and unfolded protein binding as well as oxidoreductase activity .

genes selected on dimension 2
the gene lists from dimension two not only highlighted response to unfolded protein and to organic substance, but also cellular carbohydrate biosynthesis process, trygliceride, acylglycerol, neutral metabolic processes as well as catabolic process and glucogenesis. for this dimension, however, it is sipca that selected more relevant genes that enriched these terms .

in terms of pathways, both approaches selected hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> genes. the hsp <dig> gene encodes a member of the heat shock proteins  <dig> family. these proteins play a role in cell proliferation and stress response, which explained the presence of pathways found such as oxidative stress  <cit>  . the hsp <dig> proteins are highly conserved molecular chaperones that have key roles in signal transduction, protein folding and protein degradation. they play an important roles in folding newly synthesized proteins or stabilizing and refolding denatured proteins after stress  <cit> .

summary
this preliminary analysis demonstrates the ability of sipca and spca to select genes that were relevant to the biological study. these genes that are ranked as being 'important' by both approaches, participate in the determination of the components which are linear combinations of the original variables. therefore, the expression of these selected genes not only help clustering the samples according to the different treatments or biological conditions but also have a biologically relevant meaning for the system under study.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a variant of pca called ipca that combines the advantages of both pca and ica. ipca assumes that biologically meaningful components can be obtained if most noise has been removed from the associated loading vectors. by identifying non-gaussian loading vectors from the biological data, it better reflects the internal structure of the data compared to pca and ica. on simulated data sets, we showed that ipca outperformed pca and ica in the super-gaussian case, and that the kurtosis value of the loading vectors can be used to choose the number of independent principal components. on real data sets, we assessed the cluster validity using the davies bouldin index and showed that in high dimensional cases, ipca could summarize the information of the data better or with a smaller number of components than pca or ica.

we also introduced sipca that allows an internal variable selection procedure. by applying a soft-thresholding penalization on the independent loading vectors, sparse loading vectors are obtained which enable variable selection. we have shown that sipca can correctly identify most of the important variables in a simulation study. for one data set, the genes selected with sipca and spca were further investigated to assess whether the two approaches were able to select genes that were relevant to the system under study given these genes, relevant go terms, molecular functions and pathways where highlighted. this analysis demonstrated the ability of such approaches to unravel biologically relevant information. the expression of these selected genes is also decisive to cluster the samples according to their biological conditions.

we believe that ipca approach can be useful, not only to improve data visualization and reveal experimental characteristics, but also to identify biologically relevant variables. ipca and sipca are implemented in the r package mixomics  <cit>  and its associated web-interface http://mixomics.qfab.org.
