BACKGROUND
gene expression programs are activated and repressed via atp-dependent chromatin remodeling and epigenetic modifications. during spatial and temporal activation of genes these mechanisms target nucleosomes, dna and histone tails  <cit> , impacting both cellular function and organismal development. by repositioning nucleosomes, atp-dependent chromatin remodelers contribute to chromatin accessibility and exposure of dna regulatory elements  <cit> . at the gene promoter, these mechanisms must be coordinated with a range of histone modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, to collectively define different gene activity states  <cit> . acetylation on k <dig> of histone h <dig>  by histone acetyl transferases  is commonly found at active promoters and it is therefore referred to as an epigenetic mark for active transcription. although there are examples of enrichment at other genomic regions  <cit> , h3k <dig> trimethylation  by histone methyl transferases  is also associated with active chromatin, enriched at both active and poised promoters  <cit> . one critical histone mark that cooperates with h3k4me <dig> at active promoters is the modification of h3k <dig> by acetylation   <cit> . h3k27ac together with the monomethyl state of h3k <dig>  also marks active gene enhancers . although both remodeling and histone modifications are essential to open up the chromatin and, thus, regulate accessibility of rna polymerase to become engaged in active transcription, how recruitment of remodelers and active epigenetic marks is temporally orchestrated and preserved is not fully understood.

motor proteins such as myosin are emerging as key regulators of chromatin. they coordinate global chromatin dynamics with gene-specific activities and directly affect the functional architecture of the cell nucleus  <cit> . among the nuclear myosin species, the myosin 1c isoform b - referred to as nuclear myosin  <dig>  - is the best characterized both in terms of location and function . nm <dig> works with actin and nuclear components to regulate different steps in the gene expression pathway  <cit>  and has an impact at the genomic level  <cit> . nm <dig> associates with the chromatin and this association is functional since nm <dig> localizes to both nuclear and nucleolar transcription sites in an rna-dependent manner . at the rrna gene promoter, the interaction between the chromatin-bound nm <dig> and the rna polymerase i -associated actin is required for transcription activation  <cit> . nm <dig> is also part of b-wich, a multiprotein assembly that contains the wich chromatin remodeling complex with the subunits wstf and the atpase snf2h  <cit> . on the rdna we found that wstf bookmarks the position of the chromatin remodeling complex while nm <dig> interacts with snf2h to stabilize b-wich, leading to recruitment of the hat pcaf for h3k <dig> acetylation  <cit> . nm <dig> has therefore been proposed to connect pol i with the rdna through direct interactions with the pol i-associated actin and chromatin, respectively. since this mechanism depends on the myosin atpase activity and the catalytic activity of nm <dig> is required for pol i transcription, nm <dig> is likely to function as an actin-based motor that activates transcription by providing a permissive chromatin state for rapid pol i transcription activation  <cit> . actin also interacts with unphosphorylated rna polymerase ii  as well as hypo-  and hyperphosphorylated  forms of pol ii . there is also in vitro evidence that nm <dig> plays a role in pol ii transcription at different stages  <cit> . whether the chromatin-based mechanisms described above generally apply to pol ii is, however, not known.

we set out to investigate whether nm <dig> has a fundamental function at class ii promoters, contributing to the maintenance of a chromatin state required for pol ii transcription activation. using chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing , we show, for the first time, association of a myosin species with a mammalian genome. the results from pairwise comparisons of the genomic distributions of nm <dig> and snf2h  <cit>  show co-localization at multiple genomic locations. within a subset of these locations nm <dig>  snf2h and wstf are enriched at active class ii promoters where nm <dig> specifically maintains hypophosphorylated pol ii levels and modulates b-wich assembly, including snf2h recruitment for local chromatin remodeling. we demonstrate that this, in turn, leads to recruitment of the hat pcaf and the hmt set1/ash <dig>  for h3k <dig> acetylation and h3k <dig> trimethylation, respectively. we propose that at class ii promoters nm <dig> activates transcription through a chromatin-based mechanism that coordinates recruitment of chromatin remodelers and preserves active epigenetic marks.

RESULTS
measuring nm <dig> occupancy across the mammalian genome
to study the distribution of nm <dig> across the mammalian genome, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing  analysis using a previously characterized affinity-purified antibody specific for nm <dig>  <cit> . briefly, after in vivo crosslinking with formaldehyde, chromatin was isolated from mouse embryonic fibroblasts  and subjected to immunoprecipitation with the anti-nm <dig> antibody. the captured dna was released by reversing the cross-linking, and the resulting dna library was sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. we identified a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads which were then aligned against the mouse genome to map specific regions enriched for nm <dig>  the results show that the majority of unique reads were mapped to intergenic regions, introns and promoters, including the transcription start site  and to a lesser degree, to exons and untranslated regions .fig.  <dig> genome wide analysis by chip-seq shows that nm <dig> binds across the mouse genome. a pie chart representation of chip-seq analysis with the anti nm <dig> antibody showing preferred nm <dig> occupancies. within genic regions nm <dig> is enriched at class ii promoters as well as intronic and exonic sequences. b-c nm <dig> occupancy at class ii promoters concentrates around the transcription start site , in a region comprised between −500 bp and 500 bp from tss bp base pair, chip-seq chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, nm <dig> nuclear myosin 1c



the significance of nm <dig> association with intergenic sequences remains to be understood. functional clustering of peak-related genes via gene ontology revealed, however, that nm <dig> is associated with pol ii genes involved in a wide range of biological, cellular and molecular functions . analysis of selected chip-seq profiles validated by independent chip/qpcr experiments showed peaks of nm <dig> occupancy at promoters and across the gene, at both intronic and exonic sequences . to further characterize the localization of nm <dig> at the gene level, we interrogated the mouse genome to find out whether nm <dig> occupancy at class ii promoters is compatible with the distributions of pol ii or epigenetic marks for active transcription. using the tools available in the university of california santa cruz  genome browser we analyzed several promoters such as the checkpoint clamp complex protein rad <dig> gene , selected as nm <dig> binders from our chip-seq analysis. we found that nm <dig> showed similar patterns of occupancy as pol ii, h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac. in particular, at the gene promoter and around the transcription start site, the nm <dig> occupancy peaks co-localized with those of pol ii, h3k9ac, h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> but did not correlate with the distribution of the epigenetic mark for active enhancers h3k4me <dig> .fig.  <dig> chip-seq profiles showing occupancies of nm <dig> at selected class ii genes. the profiles show peaks of nm <dig> occupancy at the promoters of mouse genes encoding ribosomal proteins , the transcription factor junb, rad9a and the holliday junction recognition protein  chip-seq chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, nm <dig> nuclear myosin 1c

it is therefore plausible that at the promoter nm <dig> regulates pol ii transcription and may do so through a chromatin-based mechanism that leads to correct deposition of the epigenetic marks h3k4me <dig>  h3k9ac and h3k27ac.

transcription activation at class ii promoters requires nm1
we next evaluated whether and how nm <dig> may be involved in transcription regulation of class ii promoters. for this, we silenced nm <dig> by rnai . lysates prepared from nm1-silenced cells or cells treated with control scrambled rnai  oligonucleotides were analyzed on immunoblots with anti-nm <dig> and anti-actin antibodies . as control against possible off-target effects in our rnai-mediated nm <dig> silencing, the same membranes probed for nm <dig> and subsequently for actin were stripped and re-probed with an anti-pan-myosin 1c antibody against an epitope present in the tail of all three myosin 1c isoforms  . we next isolated poly a mrna from mefs subjected to rnai-mediated nm <dig> gene silencing and measured relative mrna levels from several genes, selected from the nm <dig> chip-seq results. for the analysis, we selected eight different mouse protein-coding genes covering different cellular functions. we included mouse genes encoding ribosomal proteins , transcription factors , rad9a, the pre-mrna-splicing regulator wtap , rna helicases  as well as apoptotic factors such as the bcl2-associated agonist of cell death . results from the reverse transcription real time pcr  analysis show that nm <dig> gene silencing specifically induced a reduction in the relative levels of transcripts . consistent with in vitro evidence that nm <dig> associates with pol ii  <cit> , the above results suggest a possible role for nm <dig> in transcriptional regulation.fig.  <dig> nm <dig> is required for the activation of pol ii transcription. a steady state expression levels for nm <dig> and actin were analyzed on immunoblots of lysates prepared from control  and nm1-silenced mefs with an antibody to nm <dig> and with an antibody against actin. right panel, densitometric analysis of the immunoblots for semi-quantitative measurements of nm <dig> steady state protein expression relative to actin. b immunoblots on lysates from control  and nm1-silenced mefs with an antibody to nm <dig>  an anti-pan-myosin 1c antibody against an epitope present in the tail of all three myosin 1c isoforms and with an antibody against actin show marginal off-target effects in the nm <dig> gene silencing experiment by rnai. c rt-qpcr analysis of mrna transcripts on polya mrna prepared from mefs subjected to nm <dig> gene knockdown  or from mefs subjected to control sirna oligonucleotides . the mrna levels are relative to β-actin mrna. error bars represent the standard deviation of three independent experiments . d-g nm <dig> is required for promoter association of the active pol ii and actin. chip and qpcr analysis on chromatin isolated from nm <dig> knockdown cells  and control cells , using antibody against nm <dig>  active  and inactive  pol ii, actin, rpb <dig> and rpb <dig>  in all cases, qpcr analysis was performed with primers amplifying  the mouse rad9a gene promoter and  the mouse rpl <dig> gene promoter. the values from the qpcr analyses are presented as the percentage of the input signal for each primer pair. all chip experiments were successfully repeated three times . error bars represent standard deviations. in panel d, ppol ii =  <dig>  ; in panel e, ppol ii =  <dig>  ; in panel f, pactin =  <dig>  , prpb6 =  <dig>  ; in panel g, pactin =  <dig>  , prpb6 =  <dig>  , prpb8 =  <dig>  . significances were obtained by student’s t-test, two-sample equal variance. ns = non-significant. in the cartoons above the bars diagrams, arrows point to the approximate position of primers amplifying 150 bp within the promoters bp base pair, chip-seq chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, mefs mouse embryonic fibroblasts, nm <dig> nuclear myosin 1c, qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction



we next asked whether nm <dig> performs a potential regulatory function by facilitating pol ii association with the gene promoter. for this, we applied chip to crosslinked chromatin from mefs subjected to nm <dig> gene silencing, using antibodies against unphosphorylated and hypophosphorylated pol ii. we also used antibodies against actin and the actin-binding core subunits rpb <dig>  and rpb <dig>  common to all nuclear rna polymerases  <cit>  which are also known to directly interact with the largest pol ii subunit. the results from the qpcr analyses with primers amplifying the promoters of the mouse rad9a and rpl <dig> genes  revealed drops in the levels of hypophosphorylated pol ii, actin, rpb <dig> and rpb <dig> as a consequence of nm <dig> gene silencing whereas the levels of unphosphorylated pol ii did not significantly change .

since phosphorylation of the pol ii ctd occurs during transcription activation and marks pol ii engagement in the transcriptional process, the above results altogether suggest that nm <dig> may specifically activate transcription by maintaining pol ii in complex with actin at the gene promoter.

nm <dig> regulates chromatin changes compatible with pol ii transcription activation
we next asked whether the positive regulatory effect of nm <dig> on pol ii association with the gene promoter occurs through a chromatin-based mechanism. since nm <dig> is part of the b-wich complex  <cit> , we began addressing the above question by comparing the genomic distributions of nm <dig> and snf2h. a recent work mapped the different locations of snf2h across the mouse genome  <cit> . pairwise comparisons of the genomic sites occupied by nm <dig> and snf2h showed that they co-localize within a considerable number of genes . among these genes we selected some promoters and studied whether in the absence of nm <dig>  occupancies of snf2h as well as wstf are altered. for this, we applied chip to in vivo crosslinked chromatin from nm1-silenced mefs using antibodies to wstf and snf2h. the results from the qpcr analysis on the precipitated dna show that snf2h occupancy levels dropped across all promoters tested whereas the levels of wstf fluctuated in a gene specific manner .fig.  <dig> nm <dig> controls the levels of snf2h at class ii promoters but it is not required for chromatin remodeling. nm <dig> c-terminus and intact motor function are required for the association of pol ii with promoters of class ii genes. a venn diagrams displaying overlap of occupancy between nm <dig> and snf2h across genic regions. b, c chip and qpcr analysis on chromatin isolated from nm <dig> knockdown cells  and control cells , using antibodies against wstf, snf2h and nm <dig>  the qpcr analysis was performed with primers amplifying the gene promoters of  the mouse checkpoint clamp complex protein rad9a gene ,  the mouse ribosomal protein gene rpl <dig>  in all cases, the values are presented as the percentage of the input signal for each primer pair. all chip experiments were performed at least three time . error bars represent standard deviations. significances  were obtained by student’s t-test, two-sample equal variance. panel b, pwstf =  <dig>  , psnf2h =  <dig>  ;

these results suggest that at those gene promoters where nm <dig> regulates association of both snf2h and wstf, nm <dig> may have an impact on the local structure of chromatin. we therefore began to look for nm1-dependent changes in chromatin accessibility by applying a high resolution micrococcal nuclease  assay  <cit>  on chromatin isolated from nm <dig> silenced mefs. the results from the qpcr analyses with primers amplifying regions upstream and downstream the transcription start site  of the rpl <dig> gene promoter show that knocking down the nm <dig> gene induced only marginal chromatin protection over the rpl <dig> gene promoter at position − <dig> , as revealed by somewhat decreased mnase accessibility. however, the extent of chromatin protection was significantly enhanced when we performed mnase digestions on chromatin isolated from hek293t cells stably expressing mutated nm <dig> constructs that function as dominant negatives in transcription  <cit>  . specifically, we used hek293t cells expressing wild-type v5-tagged nm <dig> , a mutated nm <dig> variant that cannot bind to actin  but avidly interacts with snf2h  <cit>  while displaying decreased chromatin binding ability  or a deletion construct lacking the c-terminus  which cannot interact with the chromatin . the results from the qpcr analyses with primers amplifying regions upstream and downstream the transcription start site  of the human rpl <dig> gene promoter show that expression of either v5-wtnm <dig> or v5-Δc nm <dig> did not generally affect chromatin accessibility . in contrast, stable expression of v5-rk605aa nm <dig> produced a significant closing of the chromatin at position −70 kb similar to the nm <dig> knockdown situation but considerably enhanced . the same experiment also revealed the significant establishment of a hypersensitive site further upstream at position − <dig> . we next performed chip on chromatin isolated from hek293t cells expressing v5-wtnm <dig> or v5-rk605aa nm <dig> with antibodies to actin, wstf and snf2h as well as a control antibody. the results from the qpcr analysis with primers amplifying the same region around position − <dig> within the human rpl <dig> gene promoter show that expression of rk605aa nm <dig> induced a drop in the levels of actin, snf2h and wstf . these results demonstrate the requirement for a fully functional nm <dig> for actin association with the promoter . moreover, these results suggest that the decreased levels of snf2h upon stable rk605aa nm <dig> expression are due to snf2h sequestration that negatively regulates chromatin, since the rk605aa nm <dig> mutant interacts with snf2h and displays decreased chromatin binding efficiency. if nm <dig> is important for pol ii transcription activation and affects occupancies of actin and snf2h, pol ii transcription levels should drop in the cells that stably express nm <dig> mutants that cannot interact with actin or with chromatin. indeed, rt-qpcr analysis of the relative rad9a and rpl <dig> mrna levels on total polya mrna isolated from hek293t cells stably expressing v5-rk605aa nm <dig> and v5-Δc nm <dig> shows significant drops in pol ii transcription in comparison to wild-type . further, chip and qpcr analysis on chromatin isolated from hek293t cells expressing v5-wtnm <dig>  v5-rk605aa nm <dig> or v5-Δc nm <dig> with antibodies to actin, hypophosphorylated pol ii ctd as well as control antibodies to non-specific iggs show that expression of rk605aa nm <dig> and v5-Δc nm <dig> induced drops in the levels of actin and pol ii at the promoters of the rad9a, rpl <dig> genes . these findings confirm that nm <dig> plays a primary role in pol ii transcription and further support that nm <dig> activates transcription by maintaining pol ii in complex with actin at the gene promoter.

we next tested whether nm <dig> mediates recruitment of histone modifiers. the involvement of nm <dig> in the regulation of h <dig> acetylation and methylation became plausible when we found a correlation of the nm <dig> peaks of occupancy with promoter-specific acetylation and trimethylation of histone h <dig> . furthermore, pcaf and the hmt set1/ash <dig> that respectively target h <dig> for acetylation and trimethylation are both part of the same complex with nm <dig>  <cit> . to find out whether at class ii promoters these interactions are functional, we silenced nm <dig> and applied chip using antibodies against pcaf and set1/ash <dig>  the results from the qpcr analysis show that in the absence of nm <dig> the occupancy levels of both histone modifiers significantly dropped at all class ii promoters tested, including the promoters of mouse rpl <dig> and rad9a genes . importantly, at both promoters the nm1-dependent reductions in pcaf and set1/ash <dig> occupancy levels were accompanied by significant reductions in the levels of h3k9ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac, but not in the case of h3k4m <dig> . at class ii promoters nm <dig> is, therefore, important for recruitment of both hats and hmts that will, in turn, acetylate and trimethylate h <dig> to generate active epigenetic marks.fig.  <dig> at class ii promoters nm <dig> maintains and preserves active epigenetic marks by direct recruitment of the hat pcaf and the hmt set1/ash <dig>  a-d chip and qpcr analysis on chromatin isolated from nm <dig> knockdown mefs  and control mefs , using antibodies against pcaf, set1/ash <dig>  h3k9ac, h3k27ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k4me <dig> as well as non-specific iggs. in all cases, qpcr analysis was performed with primers amplifying  the mouse rpl <dig> gene promoter and  the mouse rad9a gene promoter. all chip experiments were successfully performed at least three times . the values are presented as the percentage of the input signal for each primer pair. error bars represent standard deviations. upon nm <dig> gene knockdown, significant changes were detected for pcaf, set1/ash <dig> and for the epigenetic marks h3k9ac, h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig>  in panel a, ppcaf =  <dig>  , pset1/ash2 =  <dig>  ; in panel b, ppcaf =  <dig>  , pset1/ash2 =  <dig>  ; in panel c, ph3k9ac =  <dig>  , ph3k27ac =  <dig> e- <dig> , ph3k4me3 =  <dig>  ; in panel d, ph3k9ac =  <dig> e- <dig> , ph3k27ac =  <dig> e- <dig> , ph3k4me3 =  <dig>  . significances were obtained by student’s t-test, two-sample equal variance. ns = non-significant chip-seq chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing, hat histone acetyl transferase, hmt histone methyl transferase, mefs mouse embryonic fibroblasts, nm <dig> nuclear myosin 1c, qpcr quantitative polymerase chain reaction



we conclude that a functional nm <dig> is required to regulate recruitment of the chromatin remodeler snf2h and histone modifiers in order to ensure an active chromatin state which is compatible with pol ii transcription.

discussion
we describe, for the first time, the functional association of a myosin motor, nm <dig>  with a mammalian genome. chip-seq analysis demonstrates that nm <dig> binds to both non-coding and coding regions of the mouse genome. when partitioning the coding sequences into promoter, exons, introns and utrs, we found that nm <dig> is particularly enriched at class ii promoters, compatible with a role for nm <dig> in the initial phases of pol ii transcription.

at the gene level, nm <dig> has been coupled to the coordination of pre-initiation complex  assembly and in transcription activation when pol ii becomes fully phosphorylated and the transcription machinery is cleared from the promoter  <cit> . we show evidence that nm <dig> gene silencing marginally affected occupancy of unphosphorylated pol ii but impaired promoter association of hypophosphorylated pol ii; this suggests that the primary function for nm <dig> is in transcription activation through a mechanism that facilitates loading and maintenance of the hypophosphorylated pol ii within class ii promoters. we propose that nm <dig> performs this function in concert with actin bound to the hypophosphorylated pol ii  <cit> . indeed, actin itself and the two actin-binding pol ii core subunits, rpb <dig> and rpb <dig>  efficiently interact with the promoter only in the presence of nm <dig>  moreover, stable expression of the rk605aa nm <dig> mutant, which does not efficiently interact with the chromatin and is deficient in actin-binding activity  <cit> , impairs association of actin with the gene promoter. we therefore suggest that there is a functional synergy between nm <dig> and actin at the gene level that is conceivably required to position the pol ii machinery at the gene promoter , possibly minimizing promoter leakage.fig.  <dig> a speculative model in which nm <dig> coordinates the local remodeling and maintenance of active epigenetic marks for transcription activation of class ii promoters. a nm <dig> interacts with actin bound to pol ii via the two core subunits rpb <dig> and rpb <dig>  b nm <dig> can also interact with snf2h, thus facilitating b-wich assembly to promote remodeling. we speculate that the nm1-actin and nm1-snf2h interactions may depend on the atpase activity of nm <dig> and may exclude each other. c this is followed by the establishment of h3k9ac, h3k27ac and h3k4me <dig> through nm1-mediated recruitment of the hat pcaf and the hmt set1/ash <dig> that ultimately leads to transcription activation hat histone acetyl transferase, hmt histone methyl transferase, nm <dig> nuclear myosin 1c



our present findings also underscore the importance of the interaction between nm <dig> and snf2h to start transcription at class ii promoters. genome-wide analysis by chip-seq shows that nm <dig> and snf2h co-localize at multiple genomic locations. the overlap between nm <dig> and snf2h is not complete, consistent with a more general role of the chromatin remodeler snf2h in the context of other nuclear functions  <cit> . interestingly, however, nm <dig> silencing generally impaired snf2h binding to the chromatin at class ii promoters but led to gene-specific fluctuations in the levels of wstf. these findings suggest that wstf forms a complex with nm <dig> and snf2h only at a subset of promoters. at these promoters , consistent with the finding that wstf is required to co-precipitate nm <dig> and snf2h from nuclear fractions  <cit> , the wstf-bound chromatin is likely to mark the precise location for b-wich assembly. nm <dig>  on the other hand, seems to play an important role in stabilizing b-wich to exert its function. we found that stable expression of the transcriptional dominant negative rk605aa nm <dig> mutant led to a local closing of chromatin and a drop in the occupancy levels of snf2h. considering the avid interaction between the rk605aa nm <dig> mutant and snf2h  <cit> , during wstf-dependent b-wich assembly, nm <dig> possibly stabilizes the association of snf2h with wstf and thus with the chromatin, and this is a pre-condition for snf2h to catalyze correct repositioning of nucleosomes . it is tempting to hypothesize that this, in turn, produces a major impact on pol ii transcription by controlling histone h <dig> dynamics  <cit> . we therefore propose that following b-wich assembly, snf2h-mediated remodeling opens up the chromatin to make it accessible to those histone modifications that occur immediately after repositioning of the nucleosomes and appear to be dependent on nm <dig>  indeed, nm <dig> gene knockdown led to decreased levels of epigenetic marks for active transcription, including h3k9ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac, but did not affect the levels of h3k4me <dig>  these changes correlate with nm1-dependent drops of pcaf and set1/ash <dig>  therefore, it is likely that both histone modifiers are physically recruited by nm1to the gene promoter, conceivably when nm <dig> does not interact with actin  <cit> . in conclusion, we propose that the active epigenetic marks h3k9ac and h3k4me <dig> are under the direct control of nm <dig> but require a local pre-setting of the chromatin mediated by snf2h in order to be fully executed and promote transcription activation .

CONCLUSIONS
class  <dig> myosins serve as divalent crosslinkers, physically connecting and generating force between actin filaments and cargos such as membrane lipids  <cit> . our results suggest that in the cell nucleus nm <dig> does not seem to be an exception to the rule, although unconventional modes of action are possible. in our working model, the role of nm <dig> at class ii promoters is dictated by its motor activity. it is linked to a cycle of attachment and detachment from dynamic pol ii-associated actin and provides a physical link between pol ii and chromatin. we speculate that the polymerase-associated actin undergoes dynamic changes in the polymerization state yet to be understood. the model translates into a temporal framework that coordinates the functions of actin in positioning hypophosphorylated pol ii at a specific site within the gene promoter, with the role of snf2h as chromatin remodeler followed by h3k9ac, h3k4me <dig> and h3k27ac. this mechanism ultimately ensures that the pol ii machinery is exposed to a local chromatin landscape compatible with transcription activation as it lowers the nucleosome barrier and allows for efficient promoter clearance  <cit> . nm <dig> is enriched at the gene promoter but it also distributes across the gene. we therefore speculate that the above mechanism may also be important for pol ii transcription elongation and nm <dig> may synergize not only with snf2h but with a cohort of chromatin remodelers.

transcriptional activation is a fundamental cellular process essential for living organisms and it is spread across the entire genome. the association of nm <dig> with a large number of class ii genes therefore argues that nm <dig> is a general factor involved in transcription activation. we speculate that this positive role in conjunction with actin and with the wstf/snf2h complex regulates genes that must be rapidly reprogrammed through chromatin de-repression in order to be activated. nuclear actin and components of the snf <dig> members of chromatin remodelers are important in transcriptional reprogramming . a recent study has specifically shown the importance of snf2h to establish gene expression programs underlying cerebellar morphogenesis and neural maturation in mice  <cit> . we therefore hypothesize that as a consequence of its motor function nm <dig> balls between actin and snf2h to regulate open chromatin states, providing a genome-wide mechanism that rapidly establishes and preserves transcriptional programs during decisions important for cell fate and behavior.
