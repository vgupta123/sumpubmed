BACKGROUND
vibrio parahaemolyticus is a halophilic gram-negative bacterium that is widely distributed in coastal waters worldwide and is associated with gastroenteritis, wound infections, and septicemia  <cit> . since the first report of fujino et al. <cit> , numerous investigations of v. parahaemolyticus have been performed using stools of patients and diseased fish. the halophile has been found seasonally in sea water of the continental united states, germany, the far east, and hawaii  <cit> . v. parahaemolyticus infections are frequently reported to occur due to the consumption of undercooked raw shellfish or direct contact with estuarine waters. in asia, many recent infections have been caused by serotype o3:k <dig> of v. parahaemolyticus <cit> .

the phages can control the population of the pathogen. among the giant t4-like phages that are specific to v. parahaemolyticus, the vibriophage kvp <dig> is the only strain for which the genome has been determined  <cit> . the size of the kvp <dig> genome is  <dig>  bp with an overall g + c content of  <dig> %. it contains  <dig> putative protein-encoding genes ,  <dig> trnas,  <dig> late promoters, and  <dig> rho-independent terminators. the genome sequence and organization of kvp <dig> show a degree of conservation with phage t <dig>  while 65% of the pegs were unique to kvp <dig>   <dig> out of the total  <dig> putative coding regions have homologs in the t <dig> genome, which includes dna replication, recombination, and repair enzymes as well as the viral capsid and tail structural genes. kvp <dig> lacks enzymes involved in dna degradation, cytosine modification and group i introns, and it probably utilizes nad salvage pathway that is unique among bacteriophages  <cit> .

phages can prompt gene recombination via homing endonucleases . in genome analyses, putative homing endonucleases  were found in vibrio parahaemolyticus phages kvp <dig> and vibrio cholerae icp <dig>  <cit> . homing endonucleases might act as possible mediators for the diversity among bacteriophage genomes by the acquisition of a novel dna to create a new species of phage. although more than  <dig> t4-related genomes have been published so far, no other known phage genome comes close to encoding the  <dig> homing endonucleases in t <dig> phage  <cit> . intron homing  <cit>  and intronless homing  <cit>  endonucleases both utilize homologous recombination between phages to transfer the genetic elements from the he-encoding genome to a he-lacking recipient. the seg and mob subtypes, which are also called freestanding endonucleases, belong to the giy-yig and hnh homing endonuclease families, respectively  <cit> , a review]. the segc, segf, segg, moba, and mobe of t <dig> endonucleases are polycistronically transcribed with their respective upstream genes, whereas the endonuclease-specific promoters for sega, segg, mobc and mobd are immediately upstream of the endonuclease genes  <cit> . there is as yet no convincing evidence that the hes can move across the boundary of species or genera. nevertheless, these transposable genes may leave a trace of their involvement after the transfers. the sequence analysis for the enterobacteria phage jse intron revealed that the putative intron contained a truncated derivative of a he gene  <cit> , very similar to the truncated sequence in the intron of the t <dig> nrdb gene, suggesting that there is a rarely-detectable trace of the mob/seg elements in contemporary phage genomes  <cit> .

we sequenced the genome of ϕpp <dig> – a new t4-like vibrio phage with mob genes – which may be another paradigm in the plausible analysis of evolution of he families in the bacteriophages and their hosts  <cit> . in the same host, vibrio parahaemolyticus, the phage ϕpp <dig> can complement kvp <dig> in studying the genome spectra of the giant t4-related vibrio phages.

methods
bacteria strains and growth conditions
vibrio strains were bought from the bioresource collection and research center, taiwan; including v. alginolyticus atcc  <dig>  v. carchariae atcc  <dig>  v. damsela atcc  <dig>  v. harveyi atcc  <dig>  v. parahaemolyticus atcc  <dig>  v. pelagius atcc  <dig>  and v. vulnificus bcrc <dig>  v. parahaemolyticus atcc  <dig> carries o <dig> serotype and no tdh/trh genes  <cit> . the vibrio strains were maintained in brain heart infusion  medium, supplemented with 3% nacl. for long-term preservation, bacteria were frozen in bhi supplemented with 1% nacl and 25% glycerol. when working, the strains were streaked onto the modified sea water yeast extract  agar plates consisting of  <dig>  g nacl,  <dig>  g mgso <dig> h2o, and  <dig>  g kcl in  <dig> ml distilled water  <cit> . the ph was adjusted to  <dig>  with  <dig> n naoh, followed by addition of  <dig>  g of proteose peptone ,  <dig>  g of yeast extract , and  <dig>  g of agar per liter.

isolation and titer of bacteriophage
the water samples were collected from the aquaculture waterways around southern taiwan. the enrichment procedure for the target phages has been described elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, 20% of mswye medium and 1% seed culture of vibrio parahaemolyticus were added the micro-filtrated samples and incubated at 37°c for four hours to enrich the phages. in determining the phage concentrations, the bacterium vibrio parahaemolyticus was freshly grown to  <dig> – <dig>  od <dig>  in about two hours, and  <dig> μl of cells were added to  <dig> μl phages in a series of dilutions for infection, followed by the agar overlay technique. the plaques were counted in 3– <dig> hours; the titers per ml were calculated by 100**.

electron microscopy
preparation of phage particles for electron microscopy has been described elsewhere  <cit> . in brief, bacteriophage particles were applied onto parafilm to produce a spherical drop. carbon-coated nitrocellulose films were fabricated on copper grids and placed face down on the sample drops for  <dig> min to absorb the particles. the samples were stained with freshly prepared 2% uranyl acetate  for  <dig> seconds. images of phage particles were taken at a magnification of  <dig> x, defocus of  <dig> μm, using a 200-kv electron microscope .

analyses of bacteriophage dna
in phage propagation, ten milliliters of ϕpp <dig> phage stock were added to  <dig> ml of v. parahaemolyticus  cultured in mswye, incubated in a shaker at 37°c for 3– <dig> hours, when the lysate was clear with some cell debris. the remaining cells and debris were removed by two centrifugations at 10000 × g for  <dig> minutes. with an optimal titer of  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu ml− <dig>  the supernatant was stored at 4°c as a phage stock. to concentrate phages using a standard protocol with polyethylene glycol precipitation  <cit> , solid nacl  and polyethylene glycol  <dig>  were added and precipitation was performed overnight at 4°c. after centrifugation, the phage particles were resuspended in  <dig> ml of sm buffer and treated with dnase i and rnase a to remove contamination of host nucleotides. the polyethylene glycol was extracted by adding an equal volume of chloroform until the interface was clear. the aqueous phase containing phages was treated with proteinase k and sodium dodecyl sulfate  at 56°c for  <dig> h. phenol extraction was carried out three times at room temperature; the aqueous phase was further extracted with a 1: <dig> mixture of equilibrated phenol and chloroform. dna precipitated by 2× volume of cold ethanol was re-dissolved in deionized water.

thermal stability of phage ϕpp2
thermal stability tests have been described elsewhere  <cit> . briefly, the bacterium vibrio parahaemolyticus was freshly inoculated at the 1% volume of seed from overnight culture into  <dig> ml of rich mswye broth. when the cell density reached  <dig> – <dig>  od <dig>  the treated phages of a series dilution were added to infect the host for  <dig> minutes, mixed with top agar, and poured onto a solid surface of regular agar plate in order to count the plaques in 3− <dig> hours.  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of phage particles were treated under 37−80°c and samples were taken at 15-min intervals. the supernatants from the centrifugation of 14000 × g for  <dig> minutes were diluted and titered for phage numbers by agar-overlay method.

genome sequencing and annotation
similar to shotgun sequencing described elsewhere, approximately  <dig> μg of the bacteriophage genomic dna was randomly sheared by nebulization, and dna sequencing was performed at mission biotech according to the manufacturer’s protocol for the genome sequencer gs junior system . low quality sequences of the reads generated by the gs junior sequencer were trimmed off. de novo assembly of the shotgun reads was performed with the gs assembler software. sequence assembly and analyses were performed essentially as described previously  <cit> . protein-coding genes  were predicted using the rast server   <cit>  and analyzed with the seed- viewer   <cit> . protein-coding genes were also checked using the ab initio gene-finding program glimmer v <dig>   <cit> . rrna genes of the draft assembly were identified using rnammer  <cit> . trna genes for all  <dig> amino acids that were predicted by the rast were further verified using trnascan-se  <cit> . automatic functional annotation results obtained by the rast were further compared with the proteins in the genbank database using psi-blast . the neural network promoter prediction  program was used to find the promoters  <cit> .

multiple sequence alignments
to determine the taxonomy status of the new phage isolate ϕpp <dig>  the genome sequence data of enterobacteria phage t <dig> and vibrio phages kvp <dig> were employed to find the high homologous regions with the new phage after psi-blast searches. complete genome sequences of the vibrio t4-like phages were acquired from ncbi, including enterobacteria phage t <dig> , vibrio phage kvp <dig> , aeromonas phage  <dig> , aeromonas phage aeh <dig> , and prochlorococcus phage p-ssm <dig> . t4-like myoviruses also include enterobacteria phages rb <dig> , rb <dig> , rb <dig> , rb <dig> , js <dig> , and jse , aeromonas phages  <dig>  and vibrio cholerae phage icp <dig> . pbcv- <dig> is the paramecium bursaria chlorella virus  <dig>  sequences of individual target genes retrieved from the genome sets were then aligned using clustalw with default options  <cit> . the best alignments of individual genes were analyzed by a neighbor-joining method using the neighbor program in phylogeny inference package   <cit> . distances were calculated using the protdist programs of phylip and displayed in treeview  <cit> . the clustalw, phylip, and treeview were bundled in the bioedit program version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
phage morphology
the morphology of phage ϕpp <dig> was observed by transmission electron microscopy, which is traditionally one of the most frequently used methods to classify phages. as figure  <dig> shows, ϕpp <dig> was a large phage with nonenveloped head, neck, collar, and tail: the head was approximately 90– <dig> nm wide by 150– <dig> nm long and the tail was about 110– <dig> nm long with 20– <dig> nm in diameter. a baseplate and tail pins were observed under different focus, while long tail-fibers were threading randomly.

host range
the susceptibility of seven vibrio strains to the phage ϕpp <dig> was also investigated with the agar-overlay method. among them, v. parahaemolyticus, v. damsela and v. alginolyticus were found susceptible to phage ϕpp <dig> while the other four species  could not be infected even at high moi.

viability of phage ϕpp <dig> in the thermal environment
thermal stability test was carried out to analyze the heat-resistant capability of phage ϕpp <dig> at ph <dig> – <dig> . the phage was incubated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 80°c for one hour, respectively. as figure  <dig> shows, the phage titers at different time intervals demonstrated that phage ϕpp <dig> stock solution retained almost 100% infection activity after incubation at temperatures lower than 37°c for one hour. when the temperatures rose above 50°c, viability of phage ϕpp <dig> declined; about 60% phages remained alive after being heated for  <dig> minutes. at temperatures over 60°c, nearly all phages were inactivated after  <dig> minutes of incubation.

genome organization and annotation
the genome sequence of vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was determined using the roche genome sequencer system . a total of  <dig>  reads and  <dig> , <dig> bases, with an average length of  <dig>  bases, were obtained. after de novo assembly among at least  <dig> nucleotide overlap with minimum overlap identity of 90%, the whole genome was aligned to one single contig, with coverage of 32-fold and the q <dig> plus bases of  <dig> % . currently, the draft genome has a total of  <dig>  bp, which includes  <dig> nt of q <dig> minus bases . the genbank access number for this new genome is assigned to be jn <dig> 

the genome size of the vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> is  <dig> bp larger than  <dig>  bp of kvp <dig> bp and far bigger than the  <dig>  bp of t <dig>  while its average g + c content was  <dig> %, which is the same as the  <dig> % of kvp <dig> but not as the  <dig> % of t <dig>  no rrna genes of the draft assembly were identified using rnammer. sixty trna overlap genes that were preliminarily predicted by the rast were further verified to be  <dig> using trnascan-se. in annotation for protein coding regions,  <dig> subsystem features were predicted by the seed-rast server, including  <dig> features which were relevant to phage structure proteins,  <dig> for phage dna synthesis,  <dig> for nucleotide reactions, and one each for fluoroquinolone resistance, protein degradation and rna metabolism. one possible gene for resistance of beta-lactamase was not included by the auto-annotation.

large indels 
overall of vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was similar to the genome organization of vibriophage kvp <dig> and enterobacteria phage t <dig> . in comparison with kvp <dig>   <dig> deletions and  <dig> insertions were found in ϕpp <dig>  of which  <dig> indels only affected one single orf. it is noteworthy that a single deletion occurred in the segd-type he , at the junction of kvp <dig>   and kvp <dig>  , implying that ϕpp <dig> had lost this he. most of the indel sizes were in the range around 100– <dig> nt; nevertheless, some large replacements existed, i.e.,  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  ,  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  ,  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  ,  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  ,  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  , and  <dig> nt at kvp <dig>  . additionally, three kvp <dig> genes were replaced by giant inserts in ϕpp2:  <dig> nt of ϕpp <dig> replaced the gene near kvp <dig>  ,  <dig> nt of ϕpp <dig> replaced the gene at kvp <dig>  , and  <dig> nt of ϕpp <dig> replaced the gene at kvp <dig>  . the three giant indels signified that the vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was a new species from kvp <dig> 

gene functions
with the extracting plausible protein sequences encoded by the genomic dnas,  <dig> pegs were found in vibrio phage ϕpp <dig>  in contrast to  <dig> pegs for kvp <dig> found with the same rast method . functions were identified by sequence similarity .  <dig>  out of  <dig> pegs were matched to known functions of t4-like phage genes and assorted bacteria genomes, while functions of  <dig>  pegs were still unknown. among these, as figure  <dig> and table  <dig> show,  <dig> pegs were matched to both t <dig> and kvp <dig> ,  <dig> pegs to kvp <dig> alone ,  <dig> pegs to other t4-like , and one to assorted bacteria . between the genomes of ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig>  the similarity of  <dig> genes was greater than 94%, whereas  <dig> pegs of kvp <dig> and  <dig> pegs of ϕpp <dig> were unmatched to any known, in addition to  <dig> genes with lower similarity . at least  <dig> pegs  were directly related to phage particle structures, such as head, tail, and baseplate. ϕpp <dig> uniquely possessed the proteins involved in potassium channel, gp <dig> , trna nucleotidyltransferase, and mob-type hes, which were not reported in the case of kvp <dig>  several genes were split: in ϕpp <dig>  peg <dig> shared paralogs with peg <dig>  as the same pattern for peg <dig> sharing with peg <dig>  while kvp <dig>   and kvp <dig>   paralogs were matched to one single ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> 

transfer rnas
the rast predicted  <dig> pieces of potential trnas, spanning in the range of  <dig> bp in vibrio phage ϕpp <dig>  while in kvp <dig>  <dig> trnas were found in the range of  <dig> bp. using trnascanse to recalculate the structures with overlapping sequences,  <dig> trnas in the cluster were double verified for vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> while  <dig> trnas remained for kvp40; both contained three pseudo-forms of low score for gca  and tgc  anticodons. the vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> trna cluster encoded for  <dig> amino acid codons, but there were no anticodons for alanine, glutamine, and tyrosine. the kvp <dig> trna region was  <dig> bp shorter than the ϕpp <dig> but shared 97% similarity over the cluster. a big insert of  <dig> nt in the middle of the cluster created no putative trna structure in the range of insert. in the vibrio phage ϕpp <dig>  one extra met-trna, which formed from the  <dig> nt mutation out of  <dig> nt, was created at the upstream of junction that was  <dig> nt upstream from the 465-nt insert.

searching mob-like genes and neighbors
in sequence similarity analysis by psi-blast, three paralog genes of homing endonucleases were found in the vibrio phage ϕpp2: peg <dig>  peg <dig>  and peg <dig>  in which the number of amino acid residues was  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> aa, respectively. the peg <dig> and peg <dig> were aligned to neighborhood of t <dig> mobe and close to mobd . the peg <dig> were situated next to the group of moba . the peg <dig> shared 37% similarity with peg <dig>  while peg <dig> shared 27% and 35% with the other two in pair-wide alignment of amino acid sequences. in bootstrap analysis with  <dig> replicates, the branch percentage showed that the three pegs in ϕpp <dig> were all mob-like homing endonucleases, least likely to be a giy-yig type . although low overall similarity was found between them, all three pegs aligned the h-n-h motif very well in their n-termini . first two his- <dig> and his- <dig> in peg <dig> were highly conserved within the motif of exhhilpk for peg <dig> and peg <dig>  the second asn- <dig> of peg <dig> was situated in the motif of sdexnlv, and the third his was paired as hxxxh found in the motif of ltareh---hxllxk.

we identified the mob types of ϕpp <dig> around the genome according to the orientation similarity to the neighbor orfs of  <dig> homing endonucleases in enterobacteria phage t4: gt  and nrd  orthologs. the details of the search methods are described in additional file  <dig>  no match to t <dig> α.gt or β.gt was found in entire genomes of ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig> ; therefore, the mobb-like gene could not exist in ϕpp <dig>  four nrd-like genes were found in ϕpp2: one was found explicitly by the rast and three others were implicit but manually confirmed with psi-blast searches. the peg <dig> protein was similar to the large subunit of anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase of class iii , with  <dig> % similarity to t <dig> nrdg, while peg <dig> was assumed to be the activating protein  for the ribonucleotide reductase with  <dig> % similarity to t <dig> nrdd. peg <dig>  which was matched to t4p <dig> in the boundary of mobe and downstream close-by segd, was denoted as nrdb. <dig>  the fourth nrd-like gene,  <dig> nt of peg <dig>  in ϕpp <dig>  was mapped to t <dig> nrdc. <dig> 

using the neighbor-indirect method , the neighbors of t <dig> mob genes were mapped back to ϕpp <dig> genome. the neighbor gene t4p <dig>  of mobc  was back-projected to ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> with a similarity of  <dig> %; another neighbor gene t4p <dig>  was matched to ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> with a similarity of  <dig> %. the distance of the peg12/ <dig> pair was at least  <dig> nt apart from the peg <dig> – it was even farther to peg  <dig> and peg <dig>  similarly, the peg <dig> and peg <dig> were still too far to be adjunction neighbors for all three potential ϕpp <dig> mob genes, i.e., peg <dig> was  <dig> nt apart from peg <dig> 

alternatively, using the so-called neighbor-direct method , the mob-neighbor genes of ϕpp <dig> peg <dig>  peg <dig>  and peg <dig> were manually de novo searched with psi-blast. neither neighbors of peg <dig>  nor of peg <dig>  were in any way close to nrd-like genes .

vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> with mobe-type neighbors
in de novo identification of a mob-type for ϕpp <dig> peg <dig>  using the neighbor-direct method, ϕpp <dig> peg <dig>  of the upstream neighbor gene was blasted to nrda of aeromonas phages , enterobacteria phages , and shigella phage sp <dig> . the downstream neighbor peg <dig>  was blasted to nrdb of aeromonas phages phias <dig> and aeh <dig>  klebsiella phage kp <dig>  and enterobacteria phage rb <dig>  another neighbor, peg <dig> , was also blasted to the nrdc thioredoxin; it aligned well as 86% homologous to nrdc thioredoxin in aeromonas phages phias <dig>  aeh <dig>  and  <dig>  as well as to klebsiella phage kp <dig>  shigella phage sp <dig>  and enterobacteria phages rb <dig>  rb <dig>  and ime <dig>  with the matches of upstream and downstream of nrd-like genes which complemented the full organization of mobe neighbors, the ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> can be annotated as a mobe-type he, without the existence of i-teviii intron.

expression of ϕpp <dig> peg  <dig> gene
all homing endonucleases of ϕpp <dig> and kvp <dig> started with an aug initiation codon. for ϕpp <dig> peg  <dig>  agga as a ribosome binding site  was optimally situated  <dig> nt upstream of the peg start codon while translation initiation regions are not positioned at the optimal distance of 6– <dig> nucleotides from the aug codon for peg <dig> and peg  <dig>  the aagagag for peg <dig> was not a good match to antisense of small rrna while the predicted peg <dig> rbs agga is immediately adjunct to the aug codon, which is rarely considered to be a good initiation site for translation.

as shown in figure  <dig>  the direction of transcription for peg <dig> and peg <dig> was counter-clockwise, whereas the peg <dig> promoter was clockwise, which was the same as most t <dig> homolog genes. the nnpp predicted several promoters of high scores  in the upstream of these three genes. it is worth noting that three promoters were identified around peg <dig>  the aforementioned mobe-type homing endonuclease. in contrast to the translational initiation aug position of peg <dig> at 149293– <dig> in the genome of ϕpp <dig>  the nearby promoters were also positioned at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . pr <dig> was the best fit to the promoter consensus, which consisted of ttgtga for − <dig> box and atgtaaaat for − <dig> box. accompanying this promoter, some weak binding sites for transcription factors were also observed: tgtaaaat for rpod <dig> at position  <dig>  atataaat for argr2at  <dig>  and gttcatat for torr at  <dig> 

discussion
electron microscopy revealed that the phage ϕpp <dig> particles were morphologically similar to t <dig> phage and vibriophage kvp <dig>  which is a long head  with a prolate icosahedral capsid and a contractile tail with associated baseplate and extended tail fibers. ϕpp <dig> is most likely type a phage in bradley’s classification of myoviridae <cit> , based on the morphological characteristics . the protein profiles in ϕpp <dig> contain a heavy band of ~ <dig> kd, which is similar to known t <dig> structure proteins of major capsid protein . with hourly heat-tolerance at 50°c , this phage could infect aquaculture pathogens, v. parahaemolyticus, v. damsela and v. alginolyticus. the complete genome of the new vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> was sequenced , which was a sibling phage of kvp <dig> but with different he genes .

in the phylogenetic tree , the peg <dig> was distantly situated next to the group of moba. although their overall similarity was low, the n-termini of all three pegs aligned well with the h-n-h motif . the first his-32/ <dig> in peg <dig> was highly conserved within the motif of exhhilpk for peg <dig> and peg <dig>  the second asn was situated in the motif of sdexnlv and the third his-pair was in the paired form of hxxxh found in the motif of ltareh---hxllxk. this reveals that the ϕpp <dig> he genes belong to mob-type because the h-n-h is the critical motif for the enzyme activity  <cit> . the vibriophage kvp <dig> carries segd/c   <cit> . v. cholerae orf <dig> in icp <dig> belongs to segg  while another icp1-orf <dig> is closely related to mobc   <cit> .

by psi-blast directly from the neighbor genes of ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> , peg <dig>  peg <dig>  and peg <dig> were highly homologous to nrda, nrdb and nrdc thioredoxin in aeromonas phages, enterobacteria phages, klebsiella phage kp <dig> and shigella phage sp <dig>  respectively. with match of both up- and downstream, together with the conserved motif of he in figure 4c, the peg <dig> can be annotated as mobe-type he. for peg <dig> protein expression, we found a good promoter  immediately upstream of the peg <dig> gene; thus, the promoter was considered as endonuclease-specific. the transcript of peg <dig> mrna was also equipped with a good consensus of ribosome binding site agga at  <dig> nt upstream of the start codon aug.

sequence of ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> was comparatively similar to moba gene, but peg <dig> was flanked by dnapol and rega , where they do not neighbor any mob genes in t <dig>  the peg <dig> and peg <dig> genes were similar to t4p <dig> and t4p <dig> , respectively. the landmark of t4p <dig>  is also very similar to peg <dig>  in other words, three ϕpp <dig> mob-like genes  would be mapped onto the cluster of i-teviii-nrdb1-mobe located at t4p <dig> to t4p <dig> in t <dig> genome  <cit> , a review]. this implies the characteristics of he mobility.

kvp <dig>   encoding  <dig> aa was psi-blast to giy-yig endonuclease genes, including aeromonas phages , acinetobacter phages , chlorella virus fr <dig>  enterobacteria phages , klebsiella phage kp <dig>  and staphylococcus phage ph <dig>  as shown in figure 4a, the phylogenetic analysis plotted kvp <dig>  to be a segc/d type. using the neighbor-direct method , kvp <dig>  and kvp <dig>  could not be matched to any protein of known function  while kvp <dig>  and kvp <dig>  could be similar to riia/b lysis protectors. both were too distant to bracket the kvp <dig>  of giy-yig endonuclease gene for mimicking the t <dig> segd neighbor. in t <dig> hes, types of mobc, mobd, and mobe can be classified by neighbor elements as well as different arrangements of their promoters: nrdd-mobc-nrdg, mobd-nrdc. <dig>  and nrda--mobe-nrdb, respectively  <cit> . in kvp <dig>  there are seven nrd-like genes that have been identified: nrda, b, c, c. <dig>  d, g, and h. the closest one for kvp <dig>  he was nrdc. <dig> , but it was still too distant to be a neighbor of kvp <dig>  to form a good setting as the t <dig> mobc/d/e. similarly, four nrd genes were found in vibrio cholerae icp <dig> but without any he insertion. therefore, kvp <dig> and icp <dig> did not have the same organization of t <dig> hes.

kvp <dig>  sharing the same host as ϕpp <dig>  has only one putative segc/d-type kvp <dig>  , which was also similar in part to t <dig> segb/e and i-teviii, even nrdb. <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the two giant vibrio phages could partially cross the boundary line at nrdb. <dig> , in the same host of v. parahaemolyticus, to catch the genes and evolve for the future form as the enterobacteria phage t <dig> did. the mechanism for the gene exchange and/or evolution may also be similar to the peg <dig>  peg <dig>  and peg  <dig> in the ϕpp <dig> as mentioned above.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the phage ϕpp <dig> was characterized by the morphology, growth, and genomics. in the complete genome sequence analysis in this study, three giant indels and the mobe-type he signified the vibrio phage ϕpp <dig> to be a new species of t4-related phages, different from kvp <dig>  our analysis suggested that ϕpp <dig> peg <dig> was an active mobe gene with transcriptional and translational elements. in the same host, vibrio parahaemolyticus, the new phage ϕpp <dig> can complement its mob-type he functions with kvp <dig> that only carries a seg-type he gene. this spectrum of genome datasets of t4-related vibrio phages that can co-infect the same host will be useful to investigate the hypothesis that a lateral transfer of freestanding hes with self-mobility may result in genomic mosaicism by recombining a variety of genetic sequences in phage genomes  <cit> .
