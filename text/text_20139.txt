BACKGROUND
down syndrome  is the most frequent autosomal aneuploidy that is compatible with post-natal life. it results from complete or partial trisomy of chromosome  <dig>  and is characterized by a complex phenotype in which over  <dig> features occur with various degrees of expression and frequency  <cit> . down syndrome is a major cause of congenital heart defects . it is associated mostly with endocardial cushion defects  <cit> , the most frequent being atrioventricular canal defects  followed by ventricular septal defects  and tetralogy of fallot  <cit> .

attempts to identify the hsa <dig> genes that contribute to the ds phenotype have focused on the down syndrome critical region  which spans approximately  <dig>  mb in band 21q <dig>   <cit> . the dscr hypothesis predicts that a gene, or genes, in this region are sufficient to produce the specific ds features when present in three copies. a narrowed region was also proposed as the candidate region for ds-chd  <cit> . the dscr hypothesis was tested in mice  <cit>  and it was found that trisomy for dscr alone is necessary but not sufficient for brain phenotypes in trisomic mice. these results suggest that the origins of trisomic phenotypes are even more complicated than formerly assumed and that they probably involve multiple gene interactions  <cit> . it has been proposed that the complex phenotypic alterations of ds could result from an interplay between hsa <dig> genes and developmentally regulated genes elsewhere on the genome  <cit>  and that the loss of genetic balance in pivotal processes regulating development might increase susceptibility to genetic and environmental insults  <cit> .

the mechanism by which an extra copy of chromosome  <dig> produces the ds phenotype is unknown and is possibly complex. it has been postulated that a triplicated chromosome  <dig> causes a 50% increase in the expression of trisomic genes as a primary dosage effect  <cit> . with the advent of microarrays and other high-throughput technologies, it became possible to demonstrate this primary dosage effect. by measuring the steady-state-rna levels in human ds tissues and cells  <cit>  and in tissues from mouse models of ds  <cit>  it has been established that the trisomy causes an overall 50% increase in the rna levels of hsa <dig> genes. at least some of this rna increase might result in perturbations of the pathways and cellular processes in which these genes function  <cit> . this can affect cardiac development and result in chd  <cit> .

given the number of candidate genes involved, the number of alternative splice variants of individual genes and the number of pathways in which these genes function, pathway analysis seems the most suitable approach to the study of genotype/phenotype correlations in ds  <cit> . data from functional studies suggest that multiple chromosome  <dig> genes affect protein processing, mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen species production, one-carbon metabolism and cell adhesion  <cit> . mitochondrial function and reactive oxygen pathways are already targets in the study of neurodegeneration  <cit> .

in this study we determined the transcription profile of hsa <dig> genes in the heart of human fetuses at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation. our goal was to understand how upregulation of hsa <dig> genes may influence the expression of genes mapping on other chromosomes and potentially involved in chd. we investigated the differential gene expression and pathway dysregulation associated with hsa <dig> trisomy in fetal hearts using dna microarray technology and functional analysis. by comparing heart samples from fetuses with or without hsa <dig> trisomy, we observed the upregulation of most, but not all, hsa <dig> genes as well as the differential expression of genes located on different chromosomes. we found that downregulation of several mitochondrial genes and upregulation of many extracellular matrix genes was a common feature of all trisomic hearts.

RESULTS
general
cardiac tissue was obtained from fetuses at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation after therapeutic abortion. ten samples from fetuses trisomic for hsa <dig> and  <dig> from euploid, control fetuses were studied. at autopsy, the phenotype of the fetuses with hsa <dig> trisomy was found to be consistent with ds. the presence of chd was established by direct examination at the time of tissue explantation and was confirmed by histological analysis of a portion of the heart . the demographic data of the analyzed samples are shown in table  <dig>

analysis of the fetal heart transcriptome
the gene expression profile of the  <dig> fetal hearts was determined by dna microarray analysis using affymetrix hg-u133a oligonucleotide arrays. the  <dig>  probe sets represented on the affymetrix chip corresponded to ~ <dig>  genes and  <dig> expressed sequence tags and clones. affymetrix microarray suite  software was used to identify presence calls and to quantify gene expression. we first determined the total number of genes expressed in the fetal hearts by assessing the number of presence calls. approximately  <dig>  probe sets, corresponding to ~ <dig>  individual genes, were called present in all the analyzed samples. we also calculated how many genes were called present in at least 2/ <dig> of the samples, and found that ~ <dig>  probe sets, corresponding to ~ <dig>  individual genes, were called present in at least  <dig> samples. this might represent a more reliable estimate of expressed genes since the mas  <dig>  software underestimates presence calls  <cit> . expressed genes and their presence calls are reported .

expression of hsa <dig> genes
the affymetrix hg-u133a chip includes  <dig> probe sets that correspond to  <dig> known genes mapping on hsa <dig>  eighty-one probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> individual genes, were called present in all analyzed samples. if we consider genes called present in at least  <dig> out of  <dig> samples,  <dig> probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> hsa <dig> genes, might be regarded as being expressed in the human heart at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation . to investigate whether hsa <dig> genes were upregulated in the heart tissue of ds fetuses, we compared the mean raw log-transformed gene expression data from ds heart tissues  with the mean control sample values . the dsh/nh ratio was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for hsa <dig> genes and ~ <dig> for all chromosomes or for any other chromosome . this difference was highly significant . scatter plot of dsh versus nh expression data shows that more than 75% of hsa <dig> genes had a dsh/nh ratio above  <dig>  whereas genes mapping on all other chromosomes were almost equally distributed above and below the line corresponding to the ratio =  <dig> . the level of variation of expression of hsa <dig> genes was not very high, with a fold change ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  twenty-five genes had a fold change below  <dig>  . quantitative real-time pcr  analyses performed on  <dig> hsa <dig> genes, either upregulated or not in ds samples, were in good agreement with the microarray results .

analysis of differentially expressed genes
we compared the gene expression levels in dsh versus nh fetuses. to this aim, raw expression data were normalized and pre-filtered to eliminate unreliable data, thus  <dig>  probe sets, corresponding to ~ <dig>  genes, were considered for further analysis. reliable gene expression data with fold change dsh vs. nh > | <dig> | and p < . <dig> were filtered. a total of  <dig> genes were significantly either downregulated  or upregulated  in the dsh group versus the nh group . thirty-two of the upregulated genes were located on hsa <dig> and thereof  <dig> dysregulated genes were on different chromosomes .

gene ontology functional class scoring  was performed by comparing the list of differentially expressed genes to the complete set of genes spotted on the affymetrix hg-u133a chip, chosen as reference list. forty-four enriched categories for downregulated genes  and  <dig> enriched categories for upregulated genes  were identified. the ratios between observed and expected genes for the most represented go categories and their p-values are reported . the most enriched go cellular component categories were mitochondrial-related, for downregulated genes, and extracellular matrix -related, for upregulated genes. at least  <dig> genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes were downregulated in the ds heart tissue out of the ~ <dig> probe sets for mitochondrial proteins spotted on the hg-u133a chip , and  <dig> genes out of the ~ <dig> probe sets encoding ecm proteins , were upregulated in dsh samples .

pathway analysis with pathway miner software revealed that 'oxidative phosphorylation'  was the pathway most influenced by hsa <dig> trisomy, because at least  <dig> genes out of the  <dig> represented on the chip, were downregulated in hsa <dig> trisomy and no upregulated oxidative phosphorylation genes were detected . the second most affected pathway was 'focal adhesion', which contained upregulated genes that mostly encode ecm proteins .

to verify that these results were not affected by the methods of data processing and data analysis, a list of differentially expressed genes was generated after a different pre-processing method  and the functional analysis was performed with a different software tool, the gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes , with a fold change higher than | <dig> | and p < . <dig>  were found to be differentially expressed in the comparison between dsh and nh samples . using the gsea to identify gene sets that correlated with the ds condition, we obtained five biologically informative gene sets . these included two sets of genes whose upregulation was highly correlated with ds , and three sets of genes whose downregulation was highly correlated with ds . these results are in very good agreement with functional analysis carried out with mas  <dig>  pre-processed data and the gotm and pathway miner web tools.

unsupervised classification of samples based on the similarity of expression data across a gene list of ~ <dig> genes, not mapping to hsa <dig> and encoding mitochondrial and ecm proteins, yielded a condition tree in which trisomic samples are perfectly separated from control samples .

the results of microarray analysis were confirmed by qrt-pcr for  <dig> oxphos genes and for  <dig> ecm genes .

expression of dyrk1a, dscr <dig> and nfatc genes
the calcineurin/nfat signaling pathway is known to be a critical regulator of organogenesis  <cit>  and the nfatc transcription factors are transiently expressed in the endocardial cushions during heart septation  <cit> . the dscr <dig> and dyrk1a genes, both mapping on hsa <dig> within the critical region for ds, act synergistically to prevent nuclear translocation of nfatc transcription factors and may cause their downregulation  <cit> . we therefore examined the expression of dyrk1a and dscr <dig> and of genes of the calcineurin pathway  in dsh and nh samples. dyrk1a was upregulated and nfatc <dig> downregulated in the trisomic heart samples . nfatc <dig> was also downregulated . dscr <dig> expression in fetal hearts varied greatly among individual samples. it was not overall significantly up- or downregulated, but its expression pattern was inversely correlated with that of nfatc <dig>  independently of trisomy or cardiopathy . the pearson correlation coefficient  was equal to - <dig>  , p <  <dig> .

comparison between ds heart samples with and without chd
the differential expression analysis of ds fetuses with  and without  cardiac defects revealed a strong homogeneity between the  <dig> groups. only  <dig> genes were differentially expressed,  <dig> upregulated and  <dig> downregulated in the cdh group, with a fold change ranging from | <dig> | to |2|, p < . <dig> . none of these genes mapped on hsa <dig>  the same functional analysis that was used to compare trisomic and control samples did not produce any significant result when genes differentially expressed in cdh vs. dh were considered. similarly, there were no differences in the expression of mitochondrial and ecm genes between ds fetuses with and without heart defects .

discussion
using dna microarray analysis we have obtained information about transcripts that are present in the human fetal heart at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation. the data indicate that approximately 50% of the  <dig>  analyzed genes are expressed in human fetal heart. the percentage of hsa <dig> genes expressed in fetal hearts was not very different.

upregulation of hsa <dig> genes
we found that hsa <dig> genes are upregulated in all trisomic fetal hearts. this demonstrates that the concept of increased transcription of hsa <dig> genes in hsa <dig> trisomy applies to the human heart irrespective of chd. the level of upregulation is modest. if we consider the mean for all hsa <dig> genes analyzed, the fold increase in hsa <dig> trisomy hearts versus controls is close to  <dig> . this result is highly significant and confirms that microarrays can detect even small differences in gene expression levels.

this modest gene upregulation is in agreement with data obtained in developing human brain and heart  <cit> , as well as in the cerebellum  <cit>  and in different tissues  <cit>  of adult ts65dn and ts1cje mice, two animal models of hsa <dig> trisomy. despite the different experimental conditions, an overall fold increase of ~ <dig> , which is consistent with a 3: <dig> ratio between trisomic and euploid fetuses, was reported in all these studies. however, the global  <dig> -fold increase does not simply result from a  <dig> -fold upregulation of each single gene. indeed, whereas the fold increase for most genes is between  <dig>  and  <dig> ,  <dig> genes are upregulated more than 2-fold in the dsh group and  <dig> genes are not upregulated in the dsh and nh groups. these results, which have been confirmed by qrt-pcr and are in agreement with another study  <cit> , are indicative of either compensatory effects or heterogeneity in the regulatory mechanisms of hsa <dig> genes. the gene expression level of individual hsa <dig> genes in the heart of ds individuals is of central relevance in the effort to understand how hsa <dig> trisomy causes chd. upregulation of a single gene or a combination of dysregulated genes might be at the base of chd. measurement of the levels of proteins corresponding to upregulated genes may shed light on the link between hsa <dig> trisomy and chd; a limited amount of information is available on this issue  <cit> .

downregulation of mitochondrial genes
our finding that  <dig> extra-hsa <dig> genes were dysregulated in all trisomic samples supports the hypothesis that genes outside of hsa <dig> might play a role in determining ds features  <cit> . functional analysis of the genes differentially expressed between trisomic and control samples shows global downregulation of genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, especially enzymes involved in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. genes from all five complexes were downregulated suggesting that the corresponding proteins and enzymatic activities might be reduced, and that the mitochondrial function could be consequently impaired.

protein levels of complex i, iii and v were found to be decreased in cerebellar and brain regions  <cit> , and a reduction of mitochondrial enzyme activity has been reported in platelets from ds patients  <cit> . moreover, impaired mitochondrial function, indicated by reduced mitochondrial redox activity and membrane potential, has been observed in ds astrocytes and in primary cultures of ds fibroblasts,  <cit> . more recently it has been reported that the brain of the ds mouse model ts1cje has decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and atp production  <cit> . these results are indicative of widespread mitochondrial dysfunction in ds. our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction might also occur in ds hearts and that the reduced expression of mitochondrial genes might be the molecular basis of this dysfunction in the heart as well as in other ds tissues. this is probably not a primay effect of gene dosage because genes for mitochondrial function mapping on hsa <dig> are either not expressed or not differentially expressed in human fetal hearts.

upregulation of ecm genes
functional analysis of the  <dig> differentially expressed genes also demonstrates global upregulation of ecm protein genes. this group includes genes encoding adhesion and ecm proteins that map on hsa <dig> such as adamts <dig>  adamts <dig>  app, jam <dig>  col6a <dig>  col6a <dig> and col18a <dig>  which are dose-dependently upregulated in trisomic samples, and genes that do not map on hsa <dig> such as fibronectin, fibulin, collagen type i, type iii, type v, type xv, metalloproteases  and several adhesion molecule genes. overexpression of this gene family is likely to affect cell adhesion properties, possibly determining an increase in adhesiveness. cells explanted from endocardial cushion derived structures of fetuses with hsa <dig> trisomy are more adhesive in vitro than those from controls  <cit> . a stochastic model has been proposed for septal defects in ds by which higher values of adhesiveness result in deficiencies of the atrio-ventricular canal development associated with clinical variability among individuals based on chance alone  <cit> .

several of the ecm genes upregulated in trisomic samples have been investigated for their potential role in ds cardiopathy. these include collagen type vi and mmps. collagen type vi is expressed in the endocardial cushions during septation, persists during valve differentiation and is implicated in endocardial cushion differentiation. its pronounced expression in hsa <dig> trisomy might lead to avsd  <cit> . mmps are involved in cardiac organogenesis by regulating cell proliferation, epithelial to mesenchymal transition, ecm remodeling and degradation. mmp <dig>  in particular, coordinates prelooping stages, heart tube formation and selective ecm degradation. it has an important functional role in early cardiogenesis, neural crest cell and cardiac cushion migration and remodeling of the pharyngeal arches and cardiac heart tube  <cit> .

it is interesting that dna microarray analysis from right ventricular biopsies of patients with tetralogy of fallot demonstrated that genes encoding ecm proteins, such as collagen type i, iii, ix, xv and fibronectin, were upregulated versus age-matched controls  <cit> , suggesting that the increase of these ecm proteins has a potential role in chd.

how might hsa <dig> gene upregulation affect the expression of other genes?
a key issue of ds pathogenesis is to understand how upregulation of hsa <dig> genes might dysregulate genes on different chromosomes. recently, a link has been proposed between two hsa <dig> genes, dyrk1a and dscr <dig>  and the nfatc family of genes. nfatc-null mice show phenotypic anomalies that resemble those observed in human ds and 65% of nfatc1–4-null mice have endocardial cushion defects  <cit> . even modest overexpression of dyrk1a decreases nfatc protein activity and levels and may induce vascular and cardiac defects  <cit> . dscr <dig> also encodes a regulatory protein that is expressed in heart tissue  <cit>  and exerts an inhibitory effect on the calcineurin/nfat signaling pathway  <cit> , although different protein isoforms may have opposite effects  <cit> . to verify whether these genes affect the heart of ds fetuses, we evaluated their differential expression both by microarray and by qrt-pcr. our analyses show that dyrk1a is upregulated and that nfatc <dig> and nfatc <dig> are downregulated in hsa <dig> trisomic samples. moreover, an increase in dscr <dig> expression in individual hearts correlated with a decrease in nfatc <dig> expression. recent data show that the enzymatic activity of complex ii and iv of the respiratory chain and mitochondrial oxidative activity are reduced in nfatc3-/-; nfatc4-/- cardiomyocytes  <cit>  suggesting that the calcineurin/nfat pathway affects mitochondrial activity during heart development. we propose that upregulation of dirk1a and/or dscr <dig> in ds might affect mitochondrial gene expression, and thereafter mitochondrial function, through the calcineurin/nfat pathway. mitochondrial abnormalities and a decrease of cox activity might also be induced by overproduction of beta app  <cit> , a gene mapping on hsa <dig>  although the ts1cje mouse model, in which app is not triplicated, also shows decreased mitochondrial function and atp production  <cit> . the transcription factor gabpalpha, which is encoded by a gene on hsa <dig>  is another regulator of the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial respiration  <cit> . however, gabpalpha was not expressed in fetal hearts at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation, although it cannot be excluded that it is expressed at different embryonic or fetal stages.

type vi collagen gene upregulation also sheds light on the potential interplay between hsa <dig> genes and genes on different chromosomes. type vi collagen, together with other collagens, is an activator of discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinases   <cit> . activated ddrs, in turn, induce the expression of metalloproteases such as mmp <dig> and mmp <dig>  <cit>  and of other ecm proteins  <cit> . moreover, ddr <dig> and ddr <dig> are upregulated in trisomic heart samples  and ddr <dig> expression has been detected by confocal microscopy in developing heart, within the cardiac cushions and eventually within the septum  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the expression of most hsa <dig> genes and of many genes located on other chromosomes were dysregulated in the heart of trisomic fetuses at 18– <dig> weeks of gestation. genes encoding mitochondrial enzymes were significantly downregulated, whereas genes encoding ecm proteins were upregulated in all trisomic hearts, irrespective of chd. in fact, gene expression did not differ between ds heart samples with or without cardiopathy. this might be due to some intrinsic limits of our approach . we nevertheless demonstrate that the expression of several gene categories is dysregulated in the hearts of all ds fetuses, and suggest that this dysregulated expression might be a prelude to heart defects. other factors, such as differences in the genetic background, different hsa <dig> haplotypes, stochastic and/or environmental factors, could play a critical role in determining the final pathogenetic result. finally, non-coding mrnas as well as conserved non-genic sequences, which have been described within hsa <dig>  might be implicated in determining the ds phenotype  <cit> .
