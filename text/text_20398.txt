BACKGROUND
l <dig> family is by its mass the largest family of long interspersed elements  in humans; l1s are present in more than  <dig>  <dig> copies and occupy approximately 17% of the total human genome length  <cit> . most of l1s found in the human genome are 5′-end truncated or damaged and therefore have lost the retrotransposition ability  <cit> . it is estimated that, on average, there are 80– <dig> l1s in a human being, which are still able to move through the genome  <cit> . a typical l <dig> is about 6 kb in length and consists of a 5′ untranslated region , two non-overlapping open reading frames , a 3′ utr and a poly-a tail.

l <dig> transcription is initiated by an rna polymerase ii promoter located at the 5′ utr  <cit> . the first open reading frame  encodes a 40 kda protein  consisting of a coiled-coil domain  <cit> , a non-canonical rna recognition motif domain  <cit>  and a basic carboxyl-terminal domain  <cit> . although the exact role of orf <dig> is not clear, it was demonstrated that this protein is required for retrotransposition  <cit> . the second protein, orf <dig>  is a 150 kda protein and it combines endonuclease   <cit>  and reverse transcriptase   <cit>  activities. the l <dig> 3′utr is about 200 bp and is poorly conserved. it contains a polypurine tract that potentially could form a g-quadruplex structure  <cit> , but the function of this sequence remains unknown. l <dig> ends with a poly-a tail that was shown to be critical for l <dig> retrotransposition  <cit> . short direct repeats, flanking a transposon, are generated from the target dna sequence during the l <dig> integration. the length of repeats can range from a few to several hundred nucleotides  <cit> .

the second family of retrotransposons by mass in the human genome is alu, belonging to the class of short interspersed elements . by copy number alu is the most ubiquitous retrotransposon with more than  <dig> mln copies present in the human genome and occupying approximately 11% of the total genome length  <cit> . the length of a typical alu is around 300 bp. though almost all sines are derived from trna  <cit> , alus are derived from 7sl rna, which functions as a component of the signal recognition particle  <cit> . it consists of two monomers, each similar to the 7sl rna, an a-rich connecting domain and a poly-a tail varying in length. in contrast to l <dig> alu cannot amplify by itself as it does not encode any proteins and hires the l <dig> retrotransposition machinery  <cit> .

the mechanism of how l <dig> rt recognizes l <dig> and alu rna remains an open question. since sines borrow retrotransposition enzymatic machinery from lines, the more general question is how rt recognizes line and sine rnas. the similarity between line and sine elements was first shown for the turtle genome: it was found that elements from the line cr <dig> family share the same 3′-end with trna-derived sines from the same genome  <cit> . later other examples were found and to date many line/sine pairs, sharing the same 3′-end sequence have been identified  <cit> , including plants  <cit> , fish , insects  <cit> , and mammals  <cit> .

it was proposed to divide all lines in two groups: the stringent type and the relaxed type  <cit> . transposons of the stringent type recognize their own 3′-end whereas transposons of the relaxed type do not involve any specific recognition of the 3′-end except for the poly-a tail. because l1/alu pairs do not share the same 3′-end sequence, the mammalian l1s were ascribed to the relaxed type. it has been suggested that the poly-a tail serves for rna recognition and for the efficient l1-mediated retrotransposition . the direct monitoring of alu retrotransposition in the human cells confirmed the requirement of a poly-a tail for alu retrotransposition  <cit> . the phenomenon of poly-a tail expansion of new alu insertions, presumably due to the slippage of the l <dig> orf <dig> protein, was demonstrated in  <cit> . it was suggested that this effect may play an important role in maintaining activity of alu elements  <cit> . it was experimentally confirmed that the poly-a tail is essential for l <dig> retrotransposition  <cit> . recognition of poly-a tail by line retrotransposition machinery could explain formation of the processed pseudogenes  <cit> , however many processed pseudogenes, lacking poly-a tails and derived from nearly all types of rna, were found in various genomes  <cit> .

co-localization of l <dig> rna, orf <dig> and orf <dig> suggests that upon translation of both orfs from l <dig> rna they immediately form ribonucleoprotein particle   <cit> . additionally, it was discovered that l <dig> rt and rna binding does take place and that it occurs at or near poly-a tail  <cit> . branched molecules consisting of junctions between transposon 3′-end cdna and the target dna, as well as specific positioning of l <dig> rna within orf <dig> protein, were detected during initial stages of l <dig> retrotransposition in vitro  <cit> . poly-a deletion did not have strong effect on retrotransposition while deletion of more substantial part reduced the number of transcripts  <cit> .

the idea that secondary or tertiary rna structure shared by l <dig> and alu could be responsible for recognition and binding of orf <dig>  possibly along with a poly-a tail, was proposed by boeke  <cit> . an important observation that retrotransposition may proceed even without a poly-a tail  <cit>  suggests presence of other important elements, playing a role in recognition of rna by retrotransposition machinery.

for the stringent-type lines one of the important elements is a stem-loop structure located at the end of the 3′utr . currently there is ample experimental evidence from different species that the 3′utr stem-loop is essential for retrotransposition: for line sart <dig> in silkworm  <cit> , for line unal <dig> in eel  <cit> , for line zfl2- <dig> and zfl2- <dig> in zebrafish  <cit> , for sine smai in salmon  <cit>  and for line r <dig> in insects  <cit> . the presence of a stem-loop at the 3′utr of line and sine, which share the same 3′-end, was found for a much broader range of species and line families, including l <dig> in algae  <cit>  and monocot plants  <cit> , tad <dig> in fungi  <cit> , l <dig> in fish , and rte in mammals  <cit> . these findings raise a question whether orf <dig> functionality to recognize a stem-loop structure at the 3′-end of a stringent line/sine pair was evolutionarily preserved for the relaxed type lines, and for l1s in particular.

an evolutionary study of lines, based on the rt domain of orf <dig> protein, estimated that non-ltr retrotransposons are as old as eukaryotes, and revealed  <dig> distinct clades showing strict vertical descendance with no sign of horizontal transfer  <cit> . however, horizontal transfer was reported for a minor fraction of line clades; these include transfer of jockey elements within drosophila  <cit> , bov-b transfer from squamata to the ancestor of ruminantia  <cit> , insertion of additional c-terminal domain into orf <dig> of insect r <dig> from plant viruses  <cit> , and l <dig> transfer from humans to bacteria neisseria gonorrhoeae  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis made on the entire line orf <dig> sequences, for which corresponding sine partner is known  <cit> , confirmed  <dig> clades reported by  <cit>  and further enlarged the number of clades to  <dig>  <cit> . lines, which are known to share 3′-end sequences with sines, appeared to be enriched in l <dig>  cr <dig>  rte and ted <dig> clades. however, the dataset taken for analysis did not include plants and invertebrates, for which examples of sine/line pairs were found too  <cit> . for plants, l1s, which share the same 3′-end sequence with sine, were reported for green algae  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis performed solely for the l <dig> clade and based on the entire orf <dig> sequences, revealed monophyletic groups for green algae, land plants and vertebrates. since land plants emerged from green algae, l1s of green algae show a strict mode of l <dig> recognition, and the strict-type l1s are observed in some plants, ohshima proposed a model of parallel relaxation of stringent l <dig> rna recognition in plants and mammals  <cit> .

evolutionary studies of l <dig> and alu families in humans also presented evidence for the vertical evolution  <cit> . human l <dig> families were further subdivided into subfamilies, which were sequentially derived from a single lineage ending up in the currently active l1pa <dig> group of l1-ta subfamily  <cit> . analysis of alu sequences led to identification of more than  <dig> families with  <dig> source elements  <cit> .

given that  evolution of lines in general and of l1s in particular showed mainly the vertical mode  <cit>  with the stringent line/sine pairs found among the different clades including l1;  l <dig> rna and orf <dig> form stable rnp, and binding of the orf <dig> to l <dig> rna was reported to take place at or near poly-a tail  <cit> ;  sequences, which lack poly-a tail, such as pseudogenes derived from different rna genes, may undergo retrotransposition  <cit> , we suggest that l <dig> rna recognition and binding with orf <dig> could be evolutionarily preserved, though not at the sequence level but at the level of the rna secondary structure. to test this hypothesis we investigated human l <dig> and alu sequences for the presence of position-specific conserved stem-loop structures. we found highly conserved stem-loop position at the 3′utr of l <dig> and at the 3′-end of alu elements in human genome. comparative analysis of this structure with other line 3′utr stem-loop structures, which were experimentally shown to be essential for retrotransposition, revealed conservation of the structure without sequence homology. we found other conserved stem-loop positions at 5′utr and at the end orf <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
l1
we performed an analysis of human l <dig> and alu transposon sequences for the presence of position-specific stem-loop structures. analyses were done for sets of presently active l <dig> transposons taken from  <cit> , a set of  <dig> l1s, divided into  <dig> subfamilies, as reported in  <cit>  , and a set of  <dig>  <dig> alus, divided into  <dig> subfamilies as reported in  <cit>  . all transposon sequences were annotated with stem-loop structures, and this annotation was used for the construction of stem-loop coverage profiles . high values in the stem-loop coverage profiles correspond to the conserved stem-loop positions.

the stem-loop coverage profiles for different sets of l <dig> sequences are shown in fig.  <dig>  figure 1a depicts conservation profiles for  <dig> most active l <dig> transposons taken from  <cit> ; the profiles for the representative l <dig> family clades – l1pa, l1pb and l1ma – are presented in fig. 1b-e. the conserved stem-loop positions of the most recent l1pa <dig> subfamily coincide with the stem-loop positions of  <dig> most active transposons. the level of position conservation gradually decreases with the age of l <dig> subfamily due to insertions, deletions and 5′utr truncations, which affect transposon length, and also due to mutations affecting the stem-loop structure. the stem-loop conservation profiles for all 27 l <dig> subfamilies from  <cit>  are provided in additional file  <dig> in the order following the phylogenetic tree depicted in fig.  <dig> in  <cit> . this trend of relaxation of position conservation is clearly seen in the direction from younger to older families and is in agreement with l <dig> vertical evolution. the profiles of  <dig> most active l1s and of the enlarged set of  <dig> active l1s, also reported in  <cit>  are almost identical .fig.  <dig> stem-loop coverage profiles. a  <dig> hottest l <dig> transposons reported as active in  <cit> ; b l1pa <dig>  the most active l <dig> subfamily from  <cit> ; c l1pa <dig>  middle-aged subfamily from l1pa clade  <cit> ; d l1pb <dig>  subfamily from l1pb clade  <cit> ; e l1ma <dig>  subfamily from l1ma clade  <cit> 


fig.  <dig> alu and 3′-end stem-loop secondary structure for aluya <dig> active element. a alu secondary structure. alu is composed from two monomers of 7sl rna. each monomer has two short stem-loops connected with u-turn at the 5′-domain and a long stem-loop with bulges at the 3′-domain. 3′-end sequence that can form stem-loop is highlighted in blue. b alu 3′-end stem-loop structure from the sequence highlighted in blue in the section 




reconstructed stem-loop conservation profiles revealed presence of conserved positions along the entire transposon length at 5′utr, orf <dig> and 3′utr. according to the profiles of currently active l1s and l1pa <dig> subfamily, we distinguished three characteristic regions at 5′utr , two characteristic positions at the end of orf <dig>  and, importantly, a conserved position at 3′ utr. all these positions are discussed below.

although phylogenetic analysis of l <dig> orfs sequences shows evolution of a strictly vertical type, this is not the case for non-coding parts of l <dig>  3′utr and 5′utr, which are not conserved at the sequence level. l <dig> changed 5′utr several times in the course of evolution  <cit> . we analyzed 5′utr regions of groups of l <dig> subfamilies having one type of 5′utr as it was proposed in  <cit> . the stem-loop conservation profiles for 5′utr regions for l <dig> subfamilies are presented in additional file  <dig>  the youngest group includes l1pa subfamilies from  <dig> to  <dig>  and the profile reflects four conserved positions along 5′utr region. as expected, significantly less conservation is observed for the older groups.

the coordinates of stem-loops along the entire transposon length for the consensus sequence of each l <dig> subfamily are given in additional file  <dig>  we also checked how the mutations, which lead to the corrupted orfs affect stem-loop structures. the stem-loop profiles of l1s with intact and corrupted orfs are given in additional file  <dig>  at least half of the mutations affecting orfs also affect stem-loop structures in the orf <dig> and orf <dig> regions. however 3′utr region remained the most conserved in terms of stem-loop structure conservation compared to 5′utr region.

alu
the rna secondary structure of alu monomers is thought to be the same as that of 7sl rna since alu is composed of two 7sl alu-domains  <cit> . each monomer has two short stem loops connected with u-turn at 5′-domain and a long stem-loop with bulges at 3′-domain  <cit>  . mutagenic experiments with alu monomer binding affinity to srp9/ <dig> showed that retrotransposition is affected more by the mutations in the binding region of the left monomer, while the mutations in the binding region of the right monomer do not have a strong effect on retrotransposition. this finding suggests different roles two monomers may play in retrotransposition. most likely, while the left alu monomer is bound to srp9/ <dig>  the right monomer participates in the recruitment of line rt, of which process the stem-loop recognition could be an important step. 7sl rna structure contains three stem-loops, two in 5′-domain and one in 3′-domain, and each potentially could be used in binding with line rt. however the reverse transcription starts precisely from the 3′-end of alu, and that is why the structures, close to 3′-end could be essential for binding with the rt.

here we performed an analysis of  <dig>  <dig> alu elements, divided into  <dig> subfamilies, as reported in  <cit> , for the presence of a 3′-end stem-loop structure. for all the elements from all families, aluj, alus and aluy, we detected a potential stem-loop structure, located at the very end of 3′-end region, several nucleotides before the poly-a tail. however, if the right alu monomer accepts the known 7sl rna structure, the predicted 3′-end stem-loop is hidden and its entire palindromic sequence is a part of the stem of the right arm . the structure of this stem-loop is given in fig. 2b and it has a 5 bp central loop together with an internal symmetrical loop  located at a distance of 6 bp from the central loop.

we took consensus sequences for each of  <dig> alu subfamilies, constructed multiple alignment and built a sequence logo profile . the level of sequence conservation for the left alu monomer is higher than that for the right. the position of 3′-end stem-loop structure, which reveals some degree of variation, is highlighted in red. the small region of 7 bp to the left of the stem-loop with a low conservation is because of the insertion into two highly active alu elements, aluyb <dig> and aluyb <dig>  <cit> . the coordinates of 3′-end stem-loop structures for the consensus sequences of each subfamily is provided in additional file  <dig>  we analyzed structural features of the predicted stem-loops depending on the subfamilies and found the following trend. all of the predicted stem-loops fall into two major classes – those with a bulge and those without a bulge. almost all stem-loops from the ancient families, aluj, have a 3′-end stem-loop without a bulge, while aluy contains almost all 3′-end stem-loops with a bulge, similar to those presented in fig.  <dig>  proportions of stem-loops with and without a bulge in the middle-aged alus family are almost equal. a possible role of a bulge in stem-loop structures in general is discussed below.fig.  <dig> alu sequence logo profile constructed from consensus sequences of  <dig> alu families. position of 3′-end stem-loop structure is highlighted in red





line 3′ utr stem-loop
3′ utr region occupies ~200-245 bp at the end of the l <dig> transposon immediately after orf <dig>  stem-loop density profiles  revealed that active transposons and the youngest l1pa <dig> family have a distinct peak in the 3′utr region. for different sets of active l <dig> elements we extracted sequences corresponding to 3′utr stem-loops and reconstructed their secondary structures. for two sets of experimentally confirmed active transposons from  <cit>  the corresponding stem-loop is located within the last 50 bp of l <dig>  3′utr stem-loop secondary structure is presented in fig. 4a.fig.  <dig> rna secondary structures for 3′utr stem-loops from different species. a l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from human genome taken from  <dig> hottest l <dig> transposons reported as active in  <cit> . b l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from eel experimentally reported as recognized by line-encoded rt  <cit> . c-d two l <dig> 3′utr stem-loops from zebrafish  experimentally reported as recognized by line-encoded rt  <cit> . e r <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from silkworm experimentally reported as recognized by line-encoded rt  <cit> . f l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from rat  <cit> . g l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from maize . h r <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from mosquito 




then we extracted 3′utr stem-loop structures for different classes of lines l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from  <dig> hottest human l <dig> transposons reported as active in  <cit>  ; l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from eel  <cit>  ; two l <dig> 3′utr stem-loops from zebrafish   <cit>  ; r <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from silkworm experimentally reported as recognized by line-encoded rt  <cit>  ; l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from rat  <cit>  ; l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from maize  <cit>  ; and r <dig> 3′utr stem-loop from mosquito  <cit>  . four of them: l <dig> from eel   <cit> , l <dig> from zebrafish   <cit> , and r <dig> from silkworm   <cit>  were experimentally reported as participating in rt binding. the characteristic feature of the reported stem-loops is an asymmetrical internal loop, or a bulge, located at a distance of 4–6 bp from the central loop .

we examined the structure of 3′utr stem-loop located at the very end of 6 l <dig> human hot transposons and found that it has a structure with a bulge most similar to that of a zebrafish. by structural similarity we mean the length of the loop and position of a bulge with respect to the loop. we also reconstructed secondary structures for 3′utr stem-loops from the set of  <dig> active l1s and  <dig> l1s. the characteristic stem-loop with a bulge was found in all  <dig> active l1s and in more than 50% of  <dig> l1s. in other cases, the structure represented a long stem-loop up to 11–12 bp with one unpaired base at one side of the stem at the position of the bulge, and in some cases with  <dig> up  <dig> asymmetrically unpaired bases in the bulge.

to assess the distribution of the bulge size and position in l <dig> and alu 3′-end stem-loops we constructed pairing/unpairing profiles  where non-zero values correspond to the unpaired bases . the profiles for l <dig>  show the presence of two internal loops, when the first internal loop occupies region from 4–5 bp if counting from the central loop. for alu we compared two structures – one that is formed by the 3′-end, and the second one within the last 50 bp of the 3′-end. the profile of the 3′-end stem-loop  revealed the presence of three unpaired regions located at 3 bp, 6–7 bp and 12 bp from the central loop. for the stem-loop corresponding to the end of the right arm single unpaired nucleotides are located at 4 bp and the bulge positions are 13–14 bp . the profiles showed that the l <dig> 3′-end stem-loop profile is more similar to the 3′-end alu stem-loop rather than to the stem-loop at the end of the right arm.fig.  <dig> pairing-unpairing profiles for l <dig> 3′utr and 3′-end alu stem-loops. the values of the resulted profile reflect how many stem-loop structures will have unpaired bases at a given position. pairing-unpairing profiles for  l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop normalized to 100% length and  l <dig> 3′utr stem-loop, stem only;  stem-loop at the end of the alu right arm normalized to 100% length and  stem-loop at the end of the alu right arm, stem only;  alu 3′-end stem-loop normalized to 100% length and  alu 3′-end stem-loop, stem only




line orf <dig> stem-loop binding region
the currently accepted model of line rna recognition by orf <dig> is that there are two types of recognition – the stringent and the relaxed. in the stringent type rt recognizes its own 3′utr tail, and in the relaxed type rt does not require any specific recognition except for the poly-a tail. division into the stringent and the relaxed type came from the observation that some line/sine pairs share the same 3′-end. for the stringent type, the experimental studies showed that a 3′utr stem-loop is required for retrotransposition.

evolutionary studies of lines for which corresponding sine partners are known showed that in the phylogenetic tree, constructed from orf <dig>  the stringent- and the relaxed-type lines are intermixed, and the stringent-type lines are present in almost all branches including mammals, fishes, insects and plants .

it was shown that for zebrafish lines zfl2- <dig> and zfl2- <dig>  belonging to the stringent type l <dig> clade, the region of the orf <dig> that binds to the 3′-end lies between the endonuclease and reverse transcriptase domains  <cit> . here we took orf <dig> sequences from different line clades and investigated the region between en and rt domains for the amino-acid conservation – approximately the region between  <dig> aa and  <dig> aa. the region of 250– <dig> aa of orf <dig> alignment is presented in fig.  <dig>  alignment is done for different types of line, it is not limited to l <dig> and includes l <dig>  r <dig>  r <dig>  cr <dig>  i, jockey, and others. although the level of conservation of the region between en and rt domains is lower compared to the en and rt domains , it is still noticeable that the sequences are homologous. therefore they could retain the function to recognize stem-loops. it is not excluded that 3′-end stem-loop recognition was conserved throughout evolution for all types of lines, both the stringent and the relaxed type.fig.  <dig> alignment of orf <dig> region between en and rt domains 




5′ utr and orf <dig> stem-loops
the l <dig> stem-loop coverage profiles revealed three conserved stem-loop positions at 5′ utr region, which we designated as 5′utr- <dig>  5′utr- <dig> and 5′utr- <dig> . the first conserved position at 5′utr- <dig> corresponds to the very beginning of the transposon . the stem-loop structure from the active transposons from this region is very stable, with a stem of 20 bp . it also has an internal asymmetrical loop  located at a distance of 10 bp from the central loop. the second conserved position  corresponds to the transposon region of ~420-600 bp. the structure located in this region is gc-rich and has a long stem of 17 bp. its characteristic feature is a stretch of four c in the loop . the 5′utr- <dig> region  also contains gc-rich stem-loop structure with a stretch of 5 g-c pairs in the upper stem and 3 g-c pairs in the lower stem .fig.  <dig> rna secondary structures of human l <dig> stem-loops from 5′utr and orf <dig> conserved positions. all the positions are highlighted in the l <dig> coverage profiles in fig.  <dig>  a 5′utr- <dig> region, corresponds to ~50-100 bp. b 5′utr- <dig> region, correspond to ~420-600 bp. c 5′utr- <dig> region, correspond to ~600-840 bp. d-e orf2- <dig> region, corresponds to 5397–5437 bp. f orf2- <dig> region, corresponds to 5540–5583 bp




two other stem-loop conserved positions are located at the end of orf2-encoded sequence. the characteristic feature of these structures is that they contain short repeat sequences in the central loops. the region orf2- <dig>  contains two stem-loop structures. the first  has poly   in the central loop . the second orf2- <dig> stem-loop contains tata  repeat . the stem-loop structure from the orf2- <dig> region  is a long 16-bp structure with a bulge located at a distance of 6 bp from the central loop . the central loop contains caca repeat.

discussion
retrotransposition is a multistage process that includes transcription, formation of ribonucleoprotein particles, translation, posttranslational modifications, transport back to the nucleus and integration in the dna by the mechanism termed target primed reverse transcription   <cit> . each stage involves transposon rna interactions with different proteins including those encoded by the transposon itself, and often stem-loop structures participate in binding.

3′utr. stringent versus relaxed
the 3′utr region was shown to play a crucial role in recognition of the stringent-type line rna by orf <dig> protein  <cit> . a stem-loop located at the very end of 3′utr was confirmed to be an essential recognition motif for the stringent-type line-sine pairs.

the line retrotransposon of insects, r <dig>  requires  <dig> nucleotides at 3′utr for recognition of its own rna  <cit> . the r <dig> orf <dig> protein from a silkworm bombyx mori can identify 3′-end not only of its own rna but also of r <dig> of drosophila melanogaster. it is noteworthy that sequence similarity of this region in bombyx mori and drosophila melanogaster r <dig> is very low. secondary structure models of 3′ utr were predicted for both organisms and it appears that 3′utr region contains several hairpins  <cit> . later it was confirmed that for silkworm sart <dig> the central 3′utr stem-loop is essential for retrotransposition, and that the transcription starts mostly from several telomeric repeat-like gguu sequences just downstream of this stem-loop  <cit> .

for eel genome it has been demonstrated that unal <dig>  and unasine <dig>  share a similar 3′ tail, which is necessary for the successful unal <dig> transposition  <cit> . moreover unal <dig> rt can recognize 3′ tail of unasine <dig>  thereby allowing its mobilization. the conserved 3′ tail consists of two parts: the stem-loop  and the pentanucleotide repeat . both of them are necessary for the transposition of unal <dig>  it has been suggested that 5′ part of the ggaua loop is recognized by the rt  <cit> . the stem includes a small internal loop, which contains a single unpaired cytidine and u-u mismatch. both are crucial for the successful transposition. this internal loop may contribute to the flexibility of the entire stem, which can be required for unal <dig> function  <cit> .

in zebrafish zfl <dig> orf <dig> protein binds the hairpin located at 3′ tail via specific site between en and rt domains  <cit> . specifically, it was found that recognition can be bipartite, involving general recognition of the stem and specific recognition of the loop.

in salmon genome sine smai element is derived from trna, and its 5′ region forms a trna-like cloverleaf structure while the 3′ domain forms an extended stem-loop structure, wherein the loop region is believed to be recognized by the line encoded rt  <cit> . it was also demonstrated that three other salmon sines, slmi, hpai and os-sine <dig> share the same 3′-end tail as line rsg- <dig>  <cit> .

in turtle genome, 3′-end sequences of sine family, designated as the tortoise poliii/sine, are also almost identical to 3′-end of lines from cr <dig> family  <cit> . this cr1-like line family is widespread in birds and in many other reptiles. examples, in which 3′-ends of trna-derived sines are derived from 3′-ends of lines include transposons from turtles, fish, mammals and plants  <cit> .

homology between 3′-end of vhc sines of bivalve mollusks and lines from cr <dig> clade of mollusk crassostrea gigas was reported in  <cit> . predictions of secondary structures of several vhs sines from different mollusk species revealed the presence of 3′utr stem-loops, however no experimental evidence is available to confirm the role of a 3′-end stem-loop in invertebrates. another stem-loop from the central 40-bp subdomain of the v-domain was found to be conserved in sines in mollusks and arthropods, but its function remains unknown.

the experimentally confirmed evidence that a stem-loop structure at 3′utr region, shared between line/sine pairs, plays an important role in line orf <dig> recognition raises a question about applicability of a similar type of recognition for the relaxed line-sine pairs. a phylogenetic analysis of orf <dig> sequences showed the strict vertical evolution of this protein. it was shown that for zebrafish lines, the region recognizing 3′-end stem-loop lies between the en and rt domains  <cit> . we showed that this region shows homology across different taxa and different line families. importantly, the stringent line/sine pairs are intermixed with the relaxed type across all branches of the phylogenetic tree starting from algae and protists, and are present in almost all divisions: in plants, insects, fish, reptiles and mammals.

we presented evidence that the recent human l <dig> and alu families, to which the currently active retrotransposons belong, have a stem-loop structure at 3′-end of their sequences. we also identified presence of a 3′-end stem-loop structure in all  analyzed human alu sequences, however the formation of this structure in vivo is an open question. the tertiary structure of alu is thought to be the same as that of two alu domains of 7sl rna bound by the rna connector sequence. after alu is transcribed it immediately forms ribonucleoprotein particle  <cit>  together with the srp9/ <dig> heterodimer  <cit> , poly a-binding protein   <cit>  and perhaps some other proteins, which can bind rna  <cit> . crystal structures of srp9/ <dig> bound to the alu domain revealed the exact positions of binding  <cit> . srp9/ <dig> binds strongly to the conserved core of 5′ domain, which forms a u-turn connecting two stem-loops . this part of 5′alu-domain rna is highly conserved in srp rnas from eubacteria to higher eukaryotes  <cit> . mutagenesis experiments showed that the srp binding regions of the two alu monomers have different outcome, with the mutations in the right monomer having a minor effect on retrotransposition. this could mean that the right monomer can be used for rt recognition. while the left alu-domain may be bound to srp9/ <dig>  the protruding arm  at 3′-domain of the right alu monomer can potentially be used for rt recognition . the structure of stem-loop at the end of the right arm  is structurally similar  to l <dig> 3′utr and zebrafish and eel line 3′utr structures. for this structure to emerge, alu right monomer has to acquire a conformation different from the accepted 7sl rna. however, it is possible that the pbp bound to the polya tail contributes to the unfolding of 3′domain, and this can lead to the formation of 3′-end stem-loop structure, that can be used for the recognition by the orf <dig> protein.

cis preference versus trans complementation
a number of authors sought to study the effect of preference of line machinery to various cellular rna, such as line and sine rna and mrna  <cit> . it was shown that l <dig> proteins predominantly retranspose their own rna – the effect named as cis preference  <cit> . in the same study it was demonstrated that l <dig> encoded proteins can retrotranspose cellular rna, though at the much lower frequencies of  <dig> - <dig> % compared to the retrotransposition frequencies of the wild-type l <dig> rnas. the mechanism through which retrotransposition of the non-line rna occurs is termed trans complementation. it is believed that cis preference does not assume rna recognition, and protein-rna binding occurs cotranslationally due to orf <dig> and l <dig> rna proximity  <cit>  while trans complementation requires a protein-rna recognition both for alus and pseudogenes. however mechanisms of the recognition remain unclear.

even with cis preference it was demonstrated that l <dig> rna, orf <dig> and orf <dig> form the ribonucleoprotein particle, and the binding of l <dig> rt takes place at or near the l <dig> rna poly-a tail  <cit> . in the work of  <cit>  cis preference was tested on the mutated l <dig> rna transcript with stop codons in both orfs and on the non-mutated l <dig> rna, and no difference in the retroposition frequency was detected. this result supports the hypothesis of specific l <dig> rna recognition by the encoded proteins. nevertheless cis versus trans preference was confirmed in this study too. it should be emphasized that the noticeable effect of cis preference, where the proximity can facilitate binding, does not exclude the direct recognition of l <dig> rna by the l <dig> encoded proteins. the presence of the secondary structure that participates in the binding of the rt with the retrotransposed rna does not contradict to the effect of cis prefenece and trans complementation where both proximity and binding specificity can play an essential role.

poly-a tail
alu and l <dig> do not share the same 3′-end sequence except for the poly-a tail. it was believed that the poly-a tail is essential for the human alu and l <dig> retrotransposition  <cit> . direct monitoring of alu retrotransposition in human cells revealed the functional importance of this element in alu retroposition  <cit> . poly-a tail is a part of alu gene and not a result of polyadenylation, because alus are transcribed by pol iii. deletion of the poly-a tail from the dna template almost abolished alu transposition diminishing frequency by  <dig> times  <cit> . an interesting observation of alu tail expansion after the round of retroposition was reported in  <cit> . expansion is thought to occur due to the slippage of l <dig> rt during the reverse transcription, and this effect could have provided evolutionary advantage to alu elements to maintain their activity by counteracting to the natural loss of a-tail  <cit> . another finding of the same study was that the tprt priming was not random with the priming positions being identified at least 25 bp from 5′-end of the poly-a tail  <cit> . this points to the constraints, which can be imposed by the bound proteins. poly-a binding protein  can also bind alu, and it was demonstrated that this protein is associated with sine rnp  <cit> .

the requirement of poly-a for the l <dig> retroposition was demonstrated in the work of  <cit> . experiments were done with an engineered l1/malat rna where l <dig> polyadenylation signal was replaced with 3′-end of the long non-coding rna malat <dig>  which can form a triple helical structure followed by a trna-like sequence. the triple helix can prevent rna degradation in the absence of the poly-a tail  <cit> . l1/malat rna lacking the poly-a tail is translated, but is not retrotransposed in cis. addition of  <dig> or  <dig> poly-a sequence restored retrotransposition in cis. also it was shown that poly-a tract is required for an association of the orf <dig> and the retrotransposition-defective l <dig> 

whether the poly-a tail recognition is done involving the sequence directly or via the pbp remains an open question. right after the translation of orf <dig> and orf <dig> both proteins associate with l <dig> and form rnp that goes back to the nucleus  <cit> . it was found that pbp is associated with l <dig> ribonucleoprotein complex and is essential for retrotransposition  <cit> . moreover, specific positioning of l <dig> rna with orf <dig> protein was observed  <cit> . non-specific interaction of line rna and orf <dig> in human cells was found between the  <dig> aa carboxy-terminal segment  of l <dig> orf <dig> protein and the human l <dig> rna  <cit> . it was shown that a newly translated l <dig> orf <dig> protein immediately binds with a high affinity to a native template with its c-terminal tail.

some studies do not support the idea that poly-a tail is essential for retroposition. in the study of  <cit>  the authors demonstrated in vitro that poly-a deletion did not have a strong effect on retrotransposition, while deletion of a more substantial 3′utr region noticeably reduced the number of transcripts  <cit> . the abundance of retropseudogenes without poly-a tail also supports the idea that poly-a tail recognition can be bypassed in retrotransposition  <cit> ). these are trna-related tailless retropseudogenes, usually composed of 5′-part of the original trna or sine founder rna. hundreds of thousands of tailless retropseudogenes derived from nearly all types of rnas were discovered  <cit> . it was shown that l1-ribonucleoprotein particles are enriched in pseudogene transcripts  <cit> . these findings tell about the possibility for retrotransposition machinery to work without the poly-a tail, and for another essential recognition motif to be present in the retrotransposed sequences. this motif can be an rna secondary structure. here we hypothesize that an alu element can mimic l <dig> with a structurally similar stem-loop though further experiments are needed to support this hypothesis.

experimental cassettes studying retrotransposition
assays to study retrotransposition are based on the idea that the indicators inserted in the cassettes will be expressed only upon a successful round of retrotransposition. usually the indicators are inserted into 3′ utr sequences. for example, mneoi cassette consists of the neo gene in the reverse orientation of the l <dig> transcription, inserted into 3′utr, and the entire line- <dig> expression vector ends with sv <dig> polyadenylation signal  <cit> . this signal forms secondary structures, which were shown to be functionally important  <cit> . specifically, a stem-loop structure, located downstream of the poly-a sequence correlates with the cleavage intensity  <cit> . besides, a stem-loop structure was artificially added to the upstream region of neo gene in order to ensure binding of bacteriophage ms <dig> coat protein for the detection of l <dig> cellular localization by fluorescent in situ hybridization   <cit> .

similarly, malat <dig>  used in the experiments of  <cit>  and disrupting the 3′utr region, ends with a trna-like sequence, which is capable to form stem-loop structures. thus, in all assays studying retrotransposition, 3′utr region is disrupted by the insertions of various sequences, but all these sequences end with stem-loop structures.

stem-loop structure and a bulge
consensus structure of 3′-end transposon has an internal asymmetrical loop, or a bulge. experiments with mutants from eel 3′-utr stem-loop showed that the deletion of the bulge completely blocks the transposon activity  <cit> . earlier it was shown for introns and viruses that the internal bulge in the stem of a stem-loop structure could be functionally important. for example, domain  <dig>  of group ii introns has a stem-loop structure with an internal bulge in the stem. it was shown that the loop, bulge and trinucleotide region in the lower stem are conserved features of splicing machinery of group ii introns and also of spliceosome  <cit> . specifically, the loop, the bulge and the triplet may bind essential metal ions to position functional groups participating in catalysis  <cit> . in hiv- <dig> the internal bulge of a stem-loop plays an important role in packaging through mechanisms, which are not fully understood  <cit> . internal loops play an important role in discriminating between mirna precursors and other conserved hairpins  <cit> . other examples where internal loops of stem-loop structures participate in binding include the murine igm  <cit>  and the yeast ribosomal protein l <dig>  <cit> . the study of thermodynamics for the reaction of a set of dna hairpins containing internal loops showed that the size of an internal loop does matter and all targeting reactions proceed with negative changes in free energy, indicating that reactions proceed spontaneously  <cit> .

for the detected 3′utr stem-loop structure with a bulge we found that the position of a bulge is conserved in all active l <dig> transposons reported in  <cit>  and conserved for more than 50% of the analyzed 6622 l <dig> elements from  <dig> families reported in  <cit> . taking into account the experiments with eel transposons where deletion of a bulge completely abolished transposition, as well as other evidence of bulges playing an essential role, we hypothesize that the presence and location of a bulge in 3′utr stem-loops plays an important role in rt recognition.

5′utr
l <dig> transcription starts from its internal promoter. l <dig> 5′utr region contains internal promoter for two l <dig> orfs, and it is not conserved at the sequence level. the length of the 5′utr region is around 1000–1200 bp. here we made analysis and present coordinates of the  <dig> active hottest transposons from  <cit> . first 100 bp were shown to possess promoter activity  <cit> . a binding site for the transcription factor yy <dig> was identified at positions ~3-26 bp with the core element sequence aagatggcc   <cit> . the other binding sites  for sry family transcription factors were also identified  <cit> . other transcription factors belonging to the family runx were shown to bind to 83–101 bp in 5′utr region  <cit> .

we found three conserved positions for stem-loops in 5′utr regions of l <dig> active transposons belonging to l1p <dig> family. the first highly conserved 5′utr- <dig> stem-loop  is located within the 100 bp region reported as having the promoter activity, and it does not overlap with the binding sites reported for yy <dig> transcription factor, which are located in the first 50 bp area. the position of 5′utr- <dig> stem-loop  immediately precedes the sry family binding site , and there is a stem-loop  located right before the second reported transcription factor binding site .

stem-loop structures in promoter regions with an important functional role were reported mostly for viruses  <cit> . perfect palindromes with the stem length of 5 bp were found in tata-less promoters of ~ 5% of human genes  <cit> . comprehensive analysis of five potential promoters of the hnrnpk gene showed that the one containing a palindrome  <cit>  showed the highest activity. further experimental efforts are required to study the role of stem-loop structures located at 5′utr regions of the transposable elements.

orf2
stem-loop structures found at the end of orf <dig> gene have characteristic dinucleotide repeats tata and caca, and also poly  sequence in the central loop, suggesting a possible role these stem-loops may play in the recognition by specific proteins. the role of the caca-repeat as a regulator of the mammalian alternative splicing was revealed in  <cit> . dinucleotide repeat motifs were found to be enriched in enhancers in drosophila  <cit> . it is possible that position-specific stem-loops at the end of orf <dig> protein play a role in the formation of ribonucleoprotein complexes, which direct the transport of l <dig> rna into specific cell locations. little is known about mrna structures in vivo. the recent study of mrna structures revealed abundance of intra-molecular double-stranded rna  <cit> . moreover, depletion of the coding regions and enrichment of 3′utr was observed. these results confirm the important role of rna secondary structures in the post-transcriptional pathways of mrnas, but further experiments are required to elucidate their function.

CONCLUSIONS
here we presented an evidence for the presence of a highly conserved 3′utr stem-loop structure in l <dig> and alu transposons in human genome. we demonstrated that this 3′utr stem-loop of l <dig> transposons is structurally similar to 3′utr stem-loops of other lines from different species, which were experimentally reported as playing an essential role in retrotransposition  <cit> , specifically rna-binding region of orf <dig> were determined in  <cit> . the region that binds to the 3′utr stem-loop in zebrafish zfl2- <dig> and zfl2- <dig> transposons, shows homology across various lines from a wide range of species. the latter suggests that the functionality to recognize a stem-loop structure at 3′-end may have persevered through evolution for relaxed line/sine pairs, including l1/alu pair. here we hypothesize that the binding of both l <dig> and alu rnas with l <dig> rt can be done via the structurally similar stem-loop structure at 3′-end of the transposon rna. the other conserved stem-loop positions at 5′utr and at the end of orf <dig> suggest their possible functions in the protein-rna interactions, but to date no experimental evidence has been reported.
