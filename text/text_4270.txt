BACKGROUND
wrky genes code for transcription factors characterized by the presence of one or two  <dig> amino-acid wrky motif including a very highly-conserved wrkygqk sequence together with a zinc-finger-like motif cx4- <dig> -cx23- <dig> -hx1- <dig> - that provides binding properties to dna. most of the wrky proteins bind to the conserved w-box tgac  <cit> . the wrky genes were initially believed to be plant-specfic  <cit> , but their ancient origin, is witnessed by the presence of two-domain wrky in two non-photosynthetic unicellular eukaryota organisms: in the diplomonadida giardia lamblia and in the mycetozoa dictyostelium discoideum. an ancestor wrky gene may, therefore, have already been present before divergence of animals, fungi and plants, but was probably lost in the former groups  <cit> . the wrky genes have experienced an incredible evolutionary success in the plant kingdom where successive duplication events have resulted in large gene families that includes up to  <dig> members in arabidopsis and over one hundred in rice. the first record of a wrky gene  <cit>  came from cloning genes from sweet potato  followed by the description of two wrky genes  in wheat, barley and wild oat  <cit> . eulgem et al.  <cit>  described most of the arabidopsis wrky genes and classified them on the basis of both the number of wrky domains and the features of their zinc-finger-like motif. wrky proteins with two wrky domains belong to group  <dig>  whereas most proteins with one wrky domain belong to group  <dig>  in general, the wrky domains of group  <dig> and group  <dig> members have the same type of zinc finger motif, whose pattern of potential zinc ligands cx4- <dig> -cx22- <dig> -hxh is unique among all known zinc-finger-like motifs. the single zinc finger motif of a small subset of wrky proteins is distinct from that of group  <dig> and  <dig> members. instead of a c2h <dig> pattern, their wrky domains contain a c2hc motif. as a result of this distinction, they were assigned to group  <dig>  <cit> .

several studies have shown that wrky genes are involved in many different biological processes such as response to wounding  <cit> , senescence  <cit> , development  <cit>  dormancy and drought tolerance  <cit> , solar ultraviolet-b radiation  <cit> , metabolism  <cit> , hormone signalling pathways  <cit>  and cold  <cit> . however, numerous wrky genes are involved in response to biotic stress and pathogen attacks. the first evidence for this was shown by rushton et al.  <cit>  who found three wrky genes that specifically were able to bind to three w-box in the promoter of the pathogenesis-related gene pr <dig> in parsley. later studies showed the involvement of other wrky genes in response to pathogen, either because they are regulated during infection  <cit>  or due to their proximity to well characterized genes that play a crucial role in plant defence, such as npr <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> .

although there are several publications describing wrky genes, only a few of the respective mutants show a clear link between a wrky gene and an altered phenotype. in arabidopsis, the gene transparent testa glabra <dig>  encodes a wrky transcription factor  that, when mutated, causes disruptions to trichome development, different seed coat colour and mucilage production  <cit> . a second wrky transcription factor of arabidopsis is involved in seed development ; the corresponding mutants show smaller seeds and early cellularization of the endosperm. despite the availability of insertion mutants for nearly every gene in arabidopsis  <cit> , a reverse genetic approach has so far only succeeded in revealing pathogen-related phenotypes for a few wrky genes; the observed phenotypes were often weak or described as "enhanced susceptibility"  <cit> . typically, phenotypes become detectable by combining mutants in multiple wrky genes or by over-expression analyses  <cit> . there are a few exceptions: the atypical gene atwrky <dig> that provides resistance to ralstonia solanacearum  <cit> , atwrky <dig> whose mutant shows enhanced susceptibility to erysiphe cichoracearum and differential accumulation of anthocyanins following methyl jasmonate application  <cit> . similarly, mutation of atwrky <dig> results in enhanced susceptibility to two necrotrophic pathogens, namely botrytis cinerea and alternaria brassicola  <cit> . for  <dig> wrky insertion mutants in rice screened in our laboratory  no phenotypic variation was observed for host and non-host pathogen interaction.

the most frequent hypothesis to explain the lack of phenotype in knockout plants is functional redundancy  <cit> . indeed, lines in which multiple wrky genes were knocked out, are often produced to test whether a small group of phylogenetically-related genes are redundantly involved in a certain function. it is, therefore, important to clearly understand the phylogenetic relationships between genes of the same family. this has been extensively performed for wrky genes both in rice and arabidopsis  <cit> . this strategy has been successful in some cases  <cit> , but it is still insufficient to pinpoint genes that might be part of the same regulatory network. another possible explanation for the lack of a clear association between wrky genes and a specific phenotype was proposed by Ülker and somssich  <cit>  who demonstrated that in parsley several wrky transcription factors, by binding to w-box in the same promoter, are involved in regulating expression of one or more target genes. to understand the function of a single wrky gene it is crucial to identify all the genes participating in the associated regulatory network. in the first attempt to unveil the network of wrky genes involved in pathogen response using a microarray approach, wang et al.  <cit>  identified five wrky genes  involved in systemic acquired resistance.

to identify the oswrky genes involved in response to magnaporthe infection and osmotic stress, and to ascertain the existence of co-expression gene clusters, a custom wrky specific oligo array was designed. hybridisation results highlighted the involvement of oswrky genes that were differentially regulated in conditions of biotic and/or osmotic stress. some of these genes were co-expressed, suggesting a possible co-regulation in the same signal transduction pathways. we also performed a pearson correlation coefficient  analysis using public arabidopsis affymetrix expression data, which is the largest and most reliable transcriptome dataset available. two main co-regulatory networks were identified, one of which contains many of the atwrky genes known to be involved in response to pathogens. the different sets of co-expressed wrky genes described in rice and arabidopsis contained a significant number of phylogenetically distantly-related genes. the power of the described approach was validated by the pearson correlation analysis of the mads-box genes which correctly identified most members shown to belong to the major network controlling floral patterning and differentiation. our results revealed the usefulness of characterizing co-regulatory networks to identify potential novel candidate genes cooperating in the same biological processes or signal transduction pathways. these candidates will, then, need to be experimentally tested at the functional level.

RESULTS
wrky proteins have been previously studied in a wide range of plant species  <cit>  and shown to be involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, such as control of metabolic pathways, drought, heat shock, senescence, development and hormone signalling. however, the most studied role of this gene family appears to be in response to biotic and abiotic stress stimuli. the main goal of the work presented here was to perform a whole gene family transcription analysis of the rice and arabidopsis wrkys to identify those that are co-expressed in biotic and abiotic stress responses and that are potentially part of common signal transduction co-regulatory networks.

phylogenetic analyses of rice wrky gene family
one hundred and four wrky genes were identified in the rice genome by searching tigr release  <dig> database using the pfam id pf <dig> and genbank using tblastn with the consensus wrky domain as the query sequence . manual inspection of the results obtained was performed to eliminate duplicated entries . phylogenetic analysis performed with the maximum likelihood method using all  <dig> proteins containing a single or double wrky domain, divided the genes into  <dig> main phylogenetic groups . additional sub-groups and smaller clades were identified within each group, based upon bootstrap values. the oswrky genes containing two domains  represented two distinct clades of the same phylogenetic main group . bootstrap values of some nodes of the tree were found to be moderately low; this finding in the global oswrky analysis was not completely unexpected due to the low degree of conservation, short length of the wrky domain and to the large size of the oswrky gene family. to attempt to improve the bootstrap values it would be necessary to align longer sequence stretches, but this approach would not be of help for wrky genes as, outside the wrky domain, amino acid sequences are poorly conserved.

to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships of wrky genes in rice and arabidopsis, a phylogenetic tree was built using all of the wrky domain sequences from the two species. our analysis is in good agreement with the classification reported by eugelm et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis . the os-atwrky tree obtained in this study suggests a further division of group  <dig> into three distinct sub-groups: 3a, 3b, 3c . more precisely, the presence of a sub-group containing only arabidopsis wrky genes  was observed, a second one including only oswrky genes  and a third one  containing the remaining genes. this partition is likely to be the consequence of a series of species-specific duplication events in the oswrky  <dig> group, which occurred after the separation of monocotyledons from dicotyledons  <cit>  and that are well documented in rice  <cit> . these events led to the great expansion of the rice wrky group  <dig>  to a total of  <dig> genes which represent 35% of the oswrky gene family.

rice wrky whole gene family transcriptome analysis
a custom 60-mer oligo array  was developed for rice wrky gene family transcriptome analysis. this array contained the complete set of oswrky gene-specific probes based upon the hundred and four known genomic sequences . rna samples isolated from leaves and roots of two week-old rice plants following biotic or abiotic stress treatments were used for hybridisation on the oswrkyarray. the expression of the  <dig> oswrky genes was assessed in the following conditions: 1) upon inoculation of leaves with one magnaporthe oryzae isolate from rice, fr <dig>  and two non-rice magnaporthe isolates, m. oryzae br <dig> from wheat and m. grisea br <dig> from crabgrass; 2) upon application of osmotic stress in hydroponic conditions. considering that fungal appressoria take about  <dig> hours to penetrate a rice leaf epidermal cell  <cit> , leaf samples were collected  <dig> hours post inoculation  with the three magnaporthe strains. the aim of this experiment was to assess early rice responses to fungal infection. rna purified for these experiments came from the same batch of rice plants used for the cytological and molecular characterization of rice-magnaporthe interactions described in faivre-rampant et al.  <cit> . for the study of oswrky gene expression upon osmotic stress conditions, samples were collected  <dig> hour  and  <dig> hours  after osmotic treatment. gene expression results obtained from oswrkyarray hybridisation experiments are reported in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  oswrky genes were considered to be up or down regulated when the logarithm values of the ratio of expression levels between treated and control rna were higher than  <dig>  or lower than - <dig>  with the associated corrected p-value <  <dig> . the analysis of differentially expressed oswrky genes revealed that  <dig>  were differentially regulated  in at least one of the six tested stress conditions . interestingly, among these  <dig> rice wrky genes, gene expression of eight  changed in response to both biotic and osmotic stress stimuli . a few genes appeared to be differentially regulated only in a limited number of stress conditions, such as oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> . oswrky <dig> was induced by fr <dig> infection, but repressed upon osmotic stress in leaves. oswrky <dig> was up regulated by br <dig>  whereas it was down regulated at late stage in both osmotic-stressed roots and leaves. oswrky <dig> is up regulated by br <dig> and upon osmotic stress, but only in roots at  <dig> hpi. finally oswrky <dig> was repressed by br <dig> and induced only in roots by osmotic stimuli at an early stage. in addition, four genes oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> were differentially-regulated only in one stress condition .

list of oswrky genes differentially-expressed in the tested experimental conditions with a corrected  p-value <  <dig>  . trm indicated the applied stress treatment. r indicates the ratio of expression levels between treated and control rna samples. m indicates log <dig>  a indicates log <dig> of the average intensity signal from microarray experiment among technical and biological replicates. genes highlighted in bold are differentially-regulated in three or more experimental conditions.

clustering analysis of the data obtained with the oswrkyarray was performed to pinpoint genes with similar expression profiles between different stress conditions. this analysis highlighted the following points :

i) three clusters of genes co-expressed in all test conditions for biotic and osmotic stress. in cluster a  and b  genes are up regulated after infection with all  <dig> magnaporthe strains, but repressed upon osmotic stress treatment, in leaves and in roots. in contrast, in the small cluster c, genes oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> are down regulated after magnaporthe interactions, but induced in roots and leaves after osmotic stress stimuli.

ii) three clusters of genes differentially expressed specifically upon one magnaporthe interaction. genes oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  are induced after infection with m. oryzae br <dig>  while oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  with m. grisea br <dig>  the remaining cluster f includes oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> genes, which are down regulated by magnaporthe oryzae strain fr <dig> 

to broaden the wrky gene family expression profile obtained with the oswrkyarray, wrky expression data from the  <dig> k nias array  were extracted to highlight those genes that are co-expressed in a wider range of abiotic stress conditions, as well as at different developmental stages . since in the  <dig> k nias array, only a subset of  <dig> wrky genes is present , a separate clustering analysis was performed . the gene expression data analysis was carried out using the same rationale as was applied to the oswrkyarray . the  <dig> k nias gene expression data confirmed the correlation between oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> , and extended the clustering to the oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> genes . these seven oswrky genes were found to be co-expressed in most conditions tested  and in different plant organs . this analysis revealed two additional clusters of co-expressed oswrky genes that were not identified by the oswrkyarray analysis. genes in cluster g, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> are co-expressed in cold and drought conditions. cluster h is constituted by the two genes oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  which have similar regulation profiles in flooding, cold and drought conditions.

our findings are partially supported by previous comprehensive gene expression analysis of oswrky genes  <cit> . ryu et al.  <cit> , analysed the oswrky gene expression after infection with different pathogens  and treatment with hormone signalling molecules. overall, between the two studies there is agreement for fifty percent of the genes identified as being differentially expressed upon magnaporthe infection. it is important to stress that the cultivars , pathogen strains, and plant-pathogen interactions  used in the two studies were different, making difficult a direct comparison of the obtained gene expression results. the wrky genes found to be induced only in one of the studies may reflect the existence of different responses to pathogen attacks and/or adaptation to different environmental conditions; these data may be pertinent to define the evolutionary history between different rice cultivars and their responses to the same pathogens. in a recent work  <cit> , the oswrky gene family was analysed under different abiotic and phytohormone treatments and the authors showed that several oswrky genes were co-expressed at the tested conditions . interestingly, oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig> were found to be co-regulated upon different abiotic stress conditions, as well as in our experiments.

comparing phylogenetic relationships and microarray-based gene expression clusters it was observed that the following pairs of closely related genes  were co-expressed, reflecting recent duplications and potentially functional redundancy . however, seven out of the nine identified clusters of co-expressed oswrkys contained sets of genes clearly belonging to different phylogenetic groups . these findings suggest the existence of "complex networks" of oswrky genes contributing to orchestrate specific signal transduction pathways.

validation of oswrkyarray by quantitative rt-pcr
to validate the results obtained with the oswrkyarray, quantitative rt-pcr analysis  of 58%  of the differentially expressed rice wrky genes was performed , to confirm their level of expression in leaves after magnaporthe infection and osmotic stress treatment. the following fourteen genes were chosen for q-pcr assays: oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  quantitative expression of these genes was measured in samples obtained from new independent experiments carried out at the same conditions as were used to obtain rna samples for the oswrkyarray transcriptome analysis. rna was extracted from leaves  <dig> hours after inoculation with the same three fungal strains that were used for the microarray experiments  and  <dig> hours post osmotic treatment, respectively. results of the q-pcr experiments from the four test conditions  are reported in table  <dig> and showed that eleven out of the fourteen tested genes  were confirmed as differentially expressed with the associated p-value <  <dig> . the q-pcr data of three genes  were not in agreement with those obtained in the microarray analysis. in conclusion, q-pcr analyses confirmed the robustness of microarray results and validated our hypothesis of the existence of co-expressed cluster of oswrky genes. in particular, q-pcr results confirmed that oswrky <dig>  oswrky <dig> and oswrky <dig>  have very similar expression profiles, in agreement with the existence of oswrkys co-regulatory networks. based upon these data, we decided to characterize in detail the occurrence of wrky networks in the model plant arabidopsis thaliana.

results of quantitative expression for the fourteen oswrky genes selected to validate the oswrkyarray results are summarized. the expression level of each oswrky gene was measured in leaf samples infected with three magnaporthe strains  and after osmotic stress treatment . ma is the log <dig> value of the ratio of expression levels between treated and control rna samples obtained in the oswrkyarray ; mq and st.dev. indicate log <dig> and standard deviation of ratio treated vs controls obtained by qrt-pcr, respectively. p-val indicates the p-value obtained with the statistical t-test. results with an associated p-value >  <dig>  were considered not significant and therefore are not reported. the "agreement" column reports agreement among microarray and qrt-pcr results. yes with agreement in up/down regulation; no without agreement in up/down regulation; qrt-pcr: indicates genes up/down regulated only in the qrt-pcr experiments. ns in the microarray colum indicates genes resulted not significant at the statistical analysis of the microarray data.

wrky co-regulatory networks
the integrated transcriptome results indicated that specific clusters of co-expressed rice wrky genes are involved in response to a range of applied stress conditions. the clusters a, e and f comprised mostly oswrky genes belonging to the same phylogenetic groups and often closely related. these genes are likely to be derived from recent duplication events and, therefore, as it may be expected, to share similar expression profiles. on the other hand, the clusters b, c, d, g and h mainly consisted of members of distinct phylogenetic groups. the largest cluster  included both distantly-related and closely-related oswrky genes .

to further investigate clusters of co-expressed wrky genes in plants, data were collected from  <dig>  arabidopsis affymetrix microarray experiments and correlation analysis based on the pearson correlation coefficient  was carried out; scatterplots of individual gene pairs were obtained, as previously described by toufighi et al.  <dig>  <cit> . a scatter plot of the results obtained with two non-correlating  and two correlating  genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  the source and the processing of the gene expression data were described in detail in menges et al.  <cit> , but a new matrix was generated for this study. for every atwrky gene on the at affymetrix microarray , we calculated the untransformed pcc value  with each of the other members of the gene family . in the logarithm analysis , the gene expression data were transformed into logarithmic values before calculating the pcc . we performed both p-lin analysis to pinpoint co-regulatory patterns occurring in only few microarray experiments  and p-log analysis to better define the wrky co-regulation in the presence of very different gene expression levels between the gene pairs under examination. to define the existence of atwrkys co-regulatory networks, values of pearson correlation coefficient higher or equal to  <dig>  were considered as significant both for the topology of the networks and for the number of represented genes. to validate the pcc threshold value used to obtain atwrkys co-regulatory networks, pcc analysis of the atmads-box gene family was also carried out. as for the topology, the appropriateness of using the  <dig>  threshold value was confirmed by plotting the number of edges and the mean of edges/gene as a function of the threshold values ; this analysis clearly highlighted that, taking a threshold value of  <dig> , the mean number of edges/gene significantly dropped by 30%, losing important information about the complexity of the network. in addition, by plotting the number of edges and number of genes as a function of the threshold values , it was observed that the number of genes is reduced by 30% in the p-lin and by 39% in the p-log analysis. moreover, the number of edges dropped by 59% in the p-lin analysis and by 70% in the p-log analysis, when the threshold value was raised from  <dig>  to  <dig> . as a further supporting evidence the atmads-box pcc analysis was performed at  <dig>  and  <dig>  threshold value , as this gene family is experimentally well characterized at the molecular and genetic levels. this analysis revealed that the network of the atmads-box genes  is very robust, with  <dig> genes in the p-lin analysis with threshold value >  <dig>   linked by  <dig> edges,  <dig> of which are backed up by molecular evidence for direct interaction  or for involvement in ternary or quaternary complexes  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> out of the  <dig> interactions lacking direct molecular evidence involved sep <dig> which is an auto-activator in the two-hybrid assay and, therefore, could not be tested as bait. two other separate networks of mads-box genes were identified from our pcc analysis, which were backed up by molecular or genetic evidence: one network comprised agl <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> implicated in pollen maturation  <cit>  and the second one agl <dig>  - <dig>  maf <dig>  maf <dig> and flf involved in flowering transition  <cit> . the p-lin networks obtained with threshold value of  <dig>   loses experimentally supported connections such as ap <dig> with p <dig> and ap3/sp <dig> with shp <dig>  in addition applying the threshold value of  <dig> , sep <dig> is absent in the main atmads-box network and the maf <dig> gene is missing in the flowering one. the p-log analysis with threshold value of  <dig>   keeps the same general topology as the p-lin one, albeit with a slightly reduced complexity , whereas results obtained from the p-log analysis with threshold value of  <dig>   reduces dramatically the number of genes and networks which are mostly experimentally validated. these data clearly showed that, carrying out the pcc analysis with a threshold value of  <dig> , the number of genes represented in the network decreases significantly, and confirmed the appropriateness of using the  <dig>  threshold value.

p-lin analysis of atwrky genes revealed the existence of two major co-regulatory networks  and of two additional smaller networks cor-c and cor-d . the p-log analysis confirmed the existence of the two interconnected cor-a and cor-b clusters  while the other two smaller networks were not present. taken together, the p-log and p-lin analyses revealed that more than 70%  of the arabidopsis wrky genes analysed are co-regulated with other wrkys . the existence in cor-a of a sub-cluster constituted of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> co-regulated genes in both p-lin and p-log analyses, was experimentally proven by kalde et al.  <cit> . in the p-lin analysis the genes atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are clustered together, whereas, atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are apart, although they belong to the same group  <dig>  this is in agreement with the results by kalde et al.  <cit> , who showed that the former four genes are induced by salicylate and pathogens, whereas the latter two are not differentially expressed at the same conditions. moreover, the implication of the strongly co-regulated atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> genes  in the same signal transduction pathways and the functional redundancy of atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  were reported by andreasson et al.  <cit>  and journot-catalino et al.  <cit> , respectively. it is noteworthy to highlight that in the atwrky pcc analysis using a threshold value of  <dig>  , the aforementioned subcluster of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> genes and the connection between atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> were lost. as previously mentioned, p-lin analysis allowed us to highlight the existence of a correlation between two genes that are expressed in just a few conditions/treatments, while p-log highlights co-regulation between genes even in the presence of large differences in their expression levels. the small networks cor-c and cor-d were present only in the p-lin analysis , reflecting their co-expression only in few tested experimental conditions . atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> genes  were found to be specifically and rapidly induced upon infection with botrytis cinerea and the virulent p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> . as a supporting evidence of their restricted but correlated role, the wrky3wrky <dig> double mutant plants exhibited more severe disease symptoms only following botrytis infection  <cit> . on the other hand, the p-log analysis  revealed the co-regulation  of two  of the three wrky genes belonging to the group 2a, previously shown to physically interact  <cit> .

in conclusion, our approach is validated by the presence in the cor-a and cor-b networks of recently duplicated genes tightly co-regulated not only in silico but also in vivo. our work revealed that both cor-a and cor-b networks included significantly co-regulated wrky genes belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups ; the wrky pcc analysis is a valuable tool to unveil novel co-regulatory pathways between wrky genes in plants.

integration of rice co-expression clusters and arabidopsis wrky co-regulatory networks
we attempted to link rice co-expression clustering data to arabidopsis co-regulatory pathways and vice versa by search for respective orthologs. we used greenphyldb  <cit>  to search for pairs of rice-arabidopsis orthologs in the wrky gene family with a bootstrap value greater than 50%. by this analysis we identified the following conserved wrky networks between rice and arabidopsis :

oswrky genes belonging to each of the nine identified co-expression clusters in rice are listed together with their assigned phylogenetic group, according to the at-os phylogenetic analysis . when identified, the putative arabidopsis ortholog/s with a bootstrap value higher than 50% is/are reported along with its/their affiliation to a co-regulatory network, as obtained by p-lin correlation analysis . no ortholog indicates the absence of identified corresponding arabidopsis gene.

- the arabidopsis orthologs  of the three rice genes of cluster a in the oswrkyarray  were significantly connected in the cor-a network. in particular, the two orthologs, atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  were connected in p-log analysis and, as aforementioned, it was reported that they physically interact in vitro and in vivo  <cit> .

- the arabidopsis orthologs  of the two rice genes of cluster e  were found to be connected within the cor-a network; these findings were experimentally supported by their very similar profiles of gene expression upon pathogen attack  <cit> .

- the six genes belonging to the rice co-expression cluster i  had all arabidopsis orthologs belonging to cor-a; five of these identified atwrky orthologs were directly pairwise connected within the cor-a network.

as regards to the remaining rice wrky genes shown to be part of co-expression clusters, in most cases, it was not possible to find their respective orthologs in arabidopsis. in particular, four of them belong to the oswrky 3c group, which has not orthologs in arabidopsis . the role of these wrky genes and of the 3c rice-specific phylogenetic group in defence related signalling pathways deserves further investigations at the functional level.

discussion
rice co-expression wrky clusters
in the present work we carried out whole oswrky gene family transcriptome analysis upon magnaporthe infection and osmotic stress treatment to identify clusters of genes differentially co-expressed upon biotic and abiotic stress conditions.

the genes oswrky <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig>  found to be differentially expressed in the oswrkyarray experiments, were previously described as being involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses  <cit> . in particular, oswrky <dig>  which resulted to be significantly regulated in our biotic/abiotic stress experiments, was reported as being modulated in roots during microbial colonization  <cit> , after application of salicylic acid, methyl jasmonate, 1-aminocyclo-propane-1-carboxylic acid and in response to both wounding and pathogen infection  <cit> .

to extend our transcriptome analysis we took advantage of a large set of gene expression data extrapolated from the  <dig> k nias array experiments. by integrating the data from both microarrays, nine co-expression wrky gene clusters were identified , some of them restricted to specific experimental conditions, while others found in a larger set of them. despite the relatively low ratios of the expression levels in both rice microarray experiments of the differentially-regulated wrky genes, the majority of them were confirmed by qrt-pcr analyses. in fact, most plant transcriptional factors are tightly and, often, only transiently up- or down-regulated upon stress stimuli making it difficult to capture their peak of induction/repression  <cit> . moreover, in the case of infection with fungal pathogens, as magnaporthe, only a few cell layers  are implicated in the plant responses  <cit> , while gene expression studies rely on bulked leaf material, causing a "dilution" effect of the detected gene expression levels  <cit> . in a number of cases only in situ hybridisation or laser capture microdissection  coupled with microarray experiments revealed the exact gene expression patterns of specific members in transcriptional factors gene families   <cit> . recently, lcm technology was also successfully applied to the study of plant-microbe interactions  <cit> .

the integration of the gene expression clusters to the phylogenetic data of the whole oswrky gene family  highlighted that also genes belonging to clearly distinct clades were significantly co-expressed. closely-related oswrky genes, likely to be derived from recent duplication events, were found to be tightly co-regulated; this was expected, since it was shown that recently duplicated wrky genes often keep the same role in signal transduction, representing a typical case of functional redundancy  <cit> . on the other hand, the oswrky cors would indicate the existence of wrky protein complexes where wrkys belonging to different subgroups bind to different cis-regulatory elements, thus giving them different targets that are expressed under the same conditions, tissue and timing. the identification of co-regulated wrky genes would allow researchers making more-informative choices of double and triple mutant combinations to circumvent redundancy or test for potential protein-protein interactions to functionally investigate the relevance of specific wrky complexes in pathogen resistance, tolerance to abiotic stress, hormonal balance and plant development.

at wrky co-regulatory networks
to address the existence of co-regulatory pathways of phylogenetically unrelated wrky genes in plants we carried out pearson correlation coefficient  analysis of arabidopsis affymetrix transcriptome data from  <dig>  experiments. all affymetrix array experiments were carried out by the same laboratory  with standardized normalization process thus facilitating the creation of robust and reliable pcc matrices. the generated matrices for atwrky genes using both untransformed  and logarithm-transformed  expression data were analysed at different threshold values of pcc. the appropriateness of the applied threshold value of  <dig>  was validated using the set of available data for the mads-box gene family of transcription factors . we took advantage of the in-depth knowledge of the mads-box signal transduction pathways and protein-protein interactions to validate the factual existence of the correlations identified in our pcc approach. in most cases the identified co-regulatory edges well reflected the existing genetic evidences described in the literature. moreover, most of the pcc-identified networks supports specific sets of mads-box genes in the same signal transduction pathways and their tight co-expression in specific cell layers  <cit> .

the pcc analysis  highlighted the presence of two main interconnected co-regulatory networks of phylogenetically distinct atwrky genes . such networks represent powerful tools to identify candidate partners of wrky genes of interest or to investigate experimentally the existence of interactions between wrky proteins in vivo . the presence in cor-a of atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig>   <dig> and - <dig> showed that the pcc approach was able to identify wrky genes previously described as being part of a functional network involved in response to stress stimuli. in fact, atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are pathogen-induced genes and known to physically interact  <cit> . atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> are also pathogen-induced genes and three of them are known to act in the same regulatory pathway. moreover, the application of salicylic acid to wrky <dig> mutants altered the expression patterns of atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> genes  <cit> . the cor-a network also included atwrky genes found to be involved in systemic acquired resistance  by wang et al.  <cit> , in a study aimed to identify targets of npr <dig>  an essential regulator of plant sar. among these targets, the authors found eight atwrkys of which five were shown to be part of the complex transcriptional regulatory network of sar. in our pcc analysis of atwrky networks, four of these five genes  not only belonged to the same group , but they were also tightly correlated . in this study, the authors stated that, in addition to atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  a related gene of atwrky <dig> is required to fully silence salicilate biosynthesis, yet to be identified. in both the p-lin and p-log analysis atwrky <dig> is significantly connected to these co-regulated genes and, therefore, it may be the best candidate to be functionally characterized.

most of the previously-mentioned genes were studied as they are phylogenetically related  <cit> . however, our pcc analysis of the atwrky genes suggested that the interaction in co-regulatory networks may occur also between phylogenetically unrelated wrky genes, such as atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> belonging to different groups .

the topology of the cor-a network predicted the presence of further genes that could be involved in the same signal transduction pathway. a role for these genes in plant defence has yet to be defined, but according to the pearson co-regulatory analysis they are interesting candidates to be tested at the genetic and biochemical level. similarly, the co-regulatory network cor-b indicated that several unrelated wrky genes, functionally uncharacterized to date, are likely to interact among each other. genetic analysis of those genes as part of a regulatory network rather than as single genes may give further insights into their function and role in specific signalling pathways. in cor-c the atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> genes were found to be strongly connected by a pcc value of  <dig> ; these two genes, together with atwrky <dig> were only seen in the p-lin analysis as their expression was found to be restricted only to a very specific plant tissue . the cor-d network, only present in the p-lin analysis, was constituted of the three genes atwrky <dig>  atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig>  while the genetic interaction between atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> both belonging to the phylogenetic group  <dig> was previously demonstrated  <cit> , the association of the yet unassigned atwrky <dig> to the other two genes and its potential role in wrky-mediated pathogen signal transduction pathways  remains to be elucidated. our pcc analysis enables scientists to formulate new working hypotheses involving atwrky genes belonging to distinct phylogenetic groups to dissect specific regulatory pathways in plants.

orthology rice - arabidopsis
a large set of microarray data is vital to build up detailed and reliable co-regulatory networks. among plants, this can be achieved, to date, only for arabidopsis thaliana due to the large and consistent expression dataset. however, the arabidopsis co-regulatory networks can be used as reference for other species where a smaller set of expression experiments is available. in addition, when information of orthology is available between arabidopsis and another species, this approach can identify the existence of genes involved in a common biological process or extend their number, even if expression data are not sufficient to reveal the existence of co-regulatory networks  <cit> . this approach was proven to be successful and highly informative for oswrky genes in this study. in fact, we found  <dig> pairs of orthologous genes among rice and arabidopsis and  <dig> of them were co-regulated in both species, integrating our microarray, q-pcr and pcc results.

in summary, our first attempt to correlate specific oswrky co-expression clusters to atwrky-cor groups revealed the existence of one large  and two smaller  conserved co-regulatory networks between the two model plants. this will now open the route to test the functional conservation of the identified clusters of wrky genes between the two species and their involvement in the same signal transduction pathways. however, the difficulty in finding orthologs between rice and arabidopsis wrky genes, due to successive rounds of duplications in both species and to the existence of monocot and dicot-specific phylogenetic clades, calls for the need to develop suitable transcriptome resources to carry out pcc analysis in rice. only this systematic analysis will enable researchers to develop working hypotheses on co-regulatory signal transduction pathways of rice wrky genes to be experimentally tested.

CONCLUSIONS
Ülker and somssich  <cit>  pointed out that to assign a specific function to members of this complex gene family "of imminent importance is to uncover wrky-interacting proteins that assist in regulating the transcription of genes". here we proposed a validated and innovative approach that aims at finding such interacting proteins relying not on their sequence similarity, but rather on co-regulation at the transcriptome level. our integrated rice-arabidopsis co-expression approach showed the existence of large co-regulatory networks of wrky genes in plants. the pcc analysis revealed that closely-related atwrky genes, known to be involved in the same signal transduction pathways , are also strongly co-regulated with other phylogenetically distantly-related members of the wrky gene family. the in-depth analysis of wrky cor networks will surely contribute to unveil the function of wrky genes, as a more targeted genetic analysis will be possible on sets of candidate genes, shown to be significantly co-regulated. moreover, the existence of complex regulatory pathways clearly supports the existence of cascades of wrky signal transduction steps, as shown for mads-box and map kinase genes  <cit> , yet to be defined.

in conclusion our rice-arabidopsis integrated approach strongly supports the existence of cross-regulatory pathways by wrky genes possibly via specific feedback mechanisms, as recently highlighted by pandey et al.  <cit> .

the pcc analysis presented in this manuscript represents a powerful tool applicable to gene families of other classes of transcriptional factors, contributing to define regulatory networks in plants activated in response to biotic and abiotic stress stimuli.
