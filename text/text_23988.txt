BACKGROUND
the mechanisms that contribute to protein thermal stability are varied, subtle, and complex  <cit> . various contributing factors to thermal stability have been proposed by comparative analysis of thermophilic and mesophilic proteins  <cit> . proposed mechanisms can be categorized  <cit>  generally as contributions by the main-chain structure , or by side-chain interactions , post-translational modifications  <cit>  or co-factor binding  <cit> ). usually increased stability arises from a combination of sequence- and structure-based adaptations resulting in a collection of improvements in the thermophilic protein compared to its mesophilic counterpart  <cit> . consequently, the determination of rules for thermal adaptations are difficult to dissect  <cit> . of particular interest, therefore, are pairs of naturally evolved proteins that are structurally very similar but differ substantially in thermal stability. such pairs allow for the dissection of contributions by amino acid diversity to thermal stability in the absence of structural heterogeneity  <cit> . the structure of the thermoanaerobacter tengcongensis ribose-binding  presented here reveals that this protein and its counterpart in the mesophilic escherichia coli  form such a pair.

the ribose-binding proteins are members of the periplasmic binding protein  superfamily whose members play roles in prokaryotic abc transport  <cit> , chemotaxis  <cit> , and intercellular communication  <cit>  systems. the pbp fold consists of two domains each of which adopts a three-layered α/β/α sandwich motif  <cit> . the two domains are linked by two or three β-strands that form a flexible hinge which permits the domains of the protein to bend towards each other in response to ligand binding at the interface between the two domains  <cit> .

here we report the high-resolution x-ray crystallographic structure of a ribose binding protein  from the hyperthermophilic bacterium t. tengcongensis   <cit> . we find that tterbp has high sequence and structural similarity to the mesophilic e. coli rbp , although they differ markedly in their thermal stability. the near identity of backbone structure offers an opportunity to address local encoding of thermal stability by amino acid substitutions.

RESULTS
thermal stability and ligand binding
orf tte <dig> in the t. tengcongensis genome sequence  <cit>  was postulated to be a ribose-binding protein homolog  based on its sequence similarity to the known e. coli rbp   and its position within a putative operon containing orfs homologous to abc transporters characteristic of solute transport. the dna for orf tte <dig>  lacking a putative periplasmic signal sequence  <cit>  , was amplified from t. tengcongensis genomic dna by the polymerase chain reaction. the resulting dna fragment was cloned into a pet21a vector in-frame with a c-terminal hexa-histidine tag preceded by a glycine-serine linker. the nucleotide sequence was confirmed by dna sequencing of the resulting vector. over-expression of tte <dig> produced ~ <dig> mg of pure protein per liter of medium, which was purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. tterbp eluted from the gel filtration column as a broad peak immediately following the void volume of the column . for subsequent crystallization and characterization of tterbp fractions of the broad peak from the gel filtration column, that were consistent with monomeric tterbp,  were pooled and concentrated to ~ <dig> mg/ml .

the thermal stability of tterbp was determined by thermal denaturation using circular dichroism . in the absence of denaturant no significant temperature-dependent change in the cd signal was observed up to 100°c; consequently, heat denaturations were carried out in the presence of varying concentrations of guanidine hydrochloride  . melting curves were found to fit a two-state model  <cit> . the apparent thermal transition midpoint  of 102°c in the absence of gdcl was determined by linear extrapolation of a series of melting point determinations carried out at different gdcl concentrations  <cit>  . tterbp is therefore significantly more stable than the mesophilic ecrbp  .

binding of ribose to tterbp was confirmed by observing ligand-mediated changes in the apptm value in the presence of  <dig>  m gdcl. under these conditions in the absence of ribose, the apptm value is 74°c; and 92°c in the presence of  <dig> mm ribose . the apptm value of the ribose complex in the absence of gdcl is 114°c; the apptm value for ecrbp under equivalent conditions is 72°c .

overall structure of tterbp
the tterbp crystal structure was solved to  <dig>  Å resolution by molecular replacement  <cit>  using the ribose-bound form of ecrbp as the search model  <cit> . the tterbp structure adopts the overall fold and topology that is characteristic of periplasmic ribose-binding proteins . the asymmetric unit contains  <dig> water molecules and two tterbp molecules  in essentially identical conformations  complexed with ribose. data collection, stereochemistry, and refinement statistics are summarized in table  <dig>

structural diversity of tterbp and ecrbp
analysis of main-chain and side-chain geometry of the aligned structures indicates there are few differences in the main-chain geometries of ecrbp and tterbp . the loops and turns in the binding pocket retain near-identical conformations. modest backbone conformational heterogeneity is observed in loops and turns that connect alternating β-strands and α-helices in tterbp and ecrbp  . proline  <dig> in tterbp corresponds to a single-residue insertion relative to ecrbp; small structural perturbations associated with this insertion are contained within five amino acids preceding and following this residue . tterbp also contains an additional three amino acids at the c-terminus that are not present in ecrbp.

the amino acid side-chain conformations are also remarkably well conserved . only  <dig> residues show a significant change in the χ <dig> torsion, resulting in the adoption of a different side-chain rotamer. of these,  <dig> correspond to substitutions, including non-conservative changes; there is therefore a significant bias for non-conservative mutations in the population of residues that exhibit rotameric changes.  <dig> of the rotamer changes occur in the surface, three in the boundary, and four in the core . the non-conservative changes occur mostly on the surface . two of the surface rotamer changes  involve charged amino acids which results in the formation of two salt bridges, two involve the loss of a salt bridge , one involves the loss of a hydrogen-bond  and three positions are involved gain of five additional hydrogen-bonds  relative to ecrbp. the four core changes are conservative substitutions and involve β-branched amino acids, altering packing of the core , and in one case  increasing the hydrophobicity and removing an unsatisfied core hydrogen-bond.

polar amino acids, non-polar amino acids, waters, and the hydrogen-bonding interactions are identical in both tterbp and ecrbp sugar-binding pockets . the total number of hydrogen-bonding interactions  <cit>  is also well conserved among tterbp and ecrbp . overall, tterbp has a total of  <dig> hydrogen-bonds, ecrbp has  <dig>  the hydrogen-bonding pattern outside of the binding pocket varies slightly among tterbp and ecrbp. tterbp has an additional three side-chain/main-chain and nine main-chain/main-chain hydrogen-bonds, but has lost five side-chain/side-chain hydrogen-bonds relative to ecrbp . five of the additional seven hydrogen-bonds observed in tterbp  are accounted for by the four-residue insertion in tterbp. there is therefore a net gain of two hydrogen-bonds in tterbp, which arise from the slight differences in the hydrogen bonding pattern of the side-chain/side-chain and main-chain/main-chain residues. it is also observed that tterbp has lost two salt bridges relative to ecrbp.

amino acid diversity among tterbp and ecrbp
the two rbps share 57% amino acid identity and 76% similarity  . the structures can be divided into core , boundary , and surface  regions using an objective, structure-based classification scheme  <cit>  . the conditional probability of a substitution occurring in a particular region  of the protein, p, is strongly biased  = p|p), with g =  <dig> , g =  <dig>  and g =  <dig>  for all interactions and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively for non-conservative mutations . the pattern of sequence divergence is also correlated with the distance from the ribose-binding site, as measured by the sequence identity and similarity, in a series of concentric shells centered on the bound ribose . not surprisingly, the residues in the shell forming the ribose contacts are identical. with increasing distance, there is an approximately monotonic decrease in sequence identity and similarity, with the farthest shell having 73% and 34% similarity and identity respectively .

*as defined in  <cit> ; charge inversions are scored as non-conservative here.

analysis of the amino acid diversity among the core, boundary and surface of ecrbp and tterbp allows identification of possible determinants of thermal stability in tterbp . a bias is observed for a gain of polar and charged amino acids on the surface of tterbp , while the opposite is observed for the tterbp core, where there is a bias for the loss of polar amino acids . there are also a significant number of substitutions of non-β-branched amino acids for β-branched amino acids in the core and boundary of tterbp  and a loss of β-branched amino acids in the surface of tterbp . interestingly a large number of β-branched amino acids are conserved in the core and boundary of tterbp and ecrbp, there is however a bias for the substitution of valine for isoleucine in the thermophile .

CONCLUSIONS
we have cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized the structure and stability of the ribose binding protein from the extremophilic bacterium t. tengcongensis. tterbp is considerably more stable than ecrbp . the amino acid backbone structure of these two proteins are essentially identical , suggesting that all the interactions contributing to differences in thermal stability are encoded entirely in the identity, location, and conformation of the amino acid side-chains.

comparison of mesophilic and thermophilic protein structures has identified many structural adaptations which are postulated to confer thermal stability  <cit> . numerous side-chain dependent contributions to thermal stability have been proposed, based on amino acid composition of thermophilic proteins and comparison of mesophilic and thermophilic protein sequences and structures, including; increased number of salt-bridges  <cit> , differences in polar/apolar exposed and buried surface areas  <cit> , introduction of prolines  <cit> , introduction of disulfide bridges  <cit> , aromatic interactions  <cit> , helix dipole stabilization  <cit> , post-translational modification  <cit> , alteration of amino acid packing  <cit>  and secondary structure propensity of amino acids  <cit> .

the high structural similarity of the tterbp/ecrbp pair allows for the dissection of amino acid diversity contributions to thermal stability in the absence of structural heterogeneity. the comparative analysis presented here shows that the substitutions responsible for conferring thermal stability on tterbp are encoded in side-chain identity and location  which serves to alter surface polarity/charge, removal of unsatisfied core hydrogen bonds and increase in core/boundary side-chain hydrophobicity. in the core of tterbp there is a bias for the loss of polar amino acids and for the introduction of valine to isoleucine mutations which possibly lower the entropic contribution to the free energy of folding and limits burying core amino acids whose hydrogen bonding potential may remain unsatisfied  <cit> . the large number of valine to isoleucine substitutions in the tterbp core and boundary leads to an increase in side-chain hydrophobicity and increased packing  <cit> . it is additionally observed in the boundary the substitution of non-β-branched amino acids for β-branched residues which has also been postulated to be important in increasing the packing  <cit> . additionally, in a trend that is also observed in other thermophilic proteins, the surface of tterbp is generally more polar and charged with the introduction of an additional three polar residues and eleven charged residues.

the acquisition of thermal stability in tterbp arises from contributions by side-chain mediated effects alone. this pair of proteins therefore provides a good test case to examine such contributions experimentally and address some long-standing questions in the acquisition of protein stability  <cit> : where in sequence and structure is stability encoded; how many mutations are needed; are mutations punctuated  or gradual, independent or correlated? recent advances in protein fabrication automation  <cit>  will assist in addressing these questions by enabling rapid construction of the many sequence variants needed.
