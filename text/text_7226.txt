BACKGROUND
ischaemic stroke results from obstruction of blood flow in a major cerebral vessel and leads to deregulation of genes whose expression promotes ischemic neuronal death and subsequent neurological dysfunction  <cit> . under ischemic conditions, energy metabolism fails, and severe reduction in mrna and protein synthesis occurs in the ischemic core region. the tissue surrounding this area  is able to maintain some functions, such as ionic homeostasis and can be partially salvaged by blood recirculation  <cit> .

the precise molecular mechanisms involved in ischemia-induced brain injury remain poorly understood. limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms involved in tissue regeneration has been gained from animal experiments using the middle cerebral artery occlusion  model which replicates, in many aspects, the neuropathological changes following stroke in humans  <cit> . although the contralateral side of the brain is not totally unaffected by ischemic damage, the collection of experimental and reference control tissue from the same animal is a better comparison than using sham-operated control in rats, while in human samples the only control tissue available is contralateral hemisphere. in addition, using contralateral tissue as a control and the direct comparison with stroke hemisphere provides the best model for validation as it removes inter-patient genetic variation and also minimises the differences in potential degradation between the target and reference mrnas. this has been applied previously in both human  <cit>  and animal  <cit>  studies. rao et al. in particular observed very few differences in gene expression between sham and contralateral cortex at  <dig> h of reperfusion following mcao in the rat  <cit> .

analysis of ischemic brain tissue with techniques capable of studying multiple transcripts simultaneously can identify gene expression changes previously not known to be implicated in ischemic pathophysiology and may lead to development of new targets for stroke therapy  <cit> . dna microarray technology has been used to investigate the expression of thousands of genes in a single hybridization experiment. several experimental studies have examined alteration of gene expression in the postischemic rat brain using microarray technology  <cit> , while blood genomic profiling in human stroke have been investigated in recent pilot studies  <cit>  . critical comparison of gene expression profiles after stroke in humans with those in animal models may lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of brain ischaemia and allow an evaluation of the usefulness of animal models in stroke research.

until recently, gene expression profiling had not been applied to patients dying of ischemic stroke, in part because human brain autopsies are not regularly obtained. although tissue obtained from brain autopsies is generally of lower quality than that of brain biopsies obtained from living patients, the majority of rna transcripts and proteins in the human brain are reasonably stable  and degrade to only a minor degree following death, thus making autopsy tissue a useful source for the isolation of nucleic acids and proteins  <cit> . previous studies evaluating the mrna quality in human post-mortem brain tissue have demonstrated a minimal effect upon their overall relative stability and indicated that frozen brains up to  <dig> hours post-mortem can be efficiently analyzed  <cit> . in line with that, in previous human brain studies, tissue was obtained up to a maximum of  <dig> hours  <cit> ,  <dig> hours  <cit> ,  <dig> hours  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  hours following death. moreover, after comparing mrna levels in autopsies and biopsies, castensson et al.  <cit>  found a general similarity in the levels between the two groups, and suggested that mrna levels in brain autopsy samples can provide clues about the brain in vivo. interestingly, almeida et al.  <cit>  found that, even if performed on degraded rna, rt-pcr can be used to provide a reliable estimate of in vivo mrna levels, maybe due to the similarities in the rates of degradation between the target and reference mrnas. recently, vikman and edvinsson  <cit>  investigated the gene expression in human brain after ischaemia using samples 7– <dig> days post-stroke; however, they obtained their samples after a considerable delay of 2– <dig> days post-mortem and they focused mainly on mrna expression of receptors.

to identify the genes whose expression was changed in the human brain following ischaemia, we investigated the dynamic changes in gene expression in brain samples  from patients with various times of survival  following stroke and compared them with those at various time-points  following middle cerebral artery occlusion  in rats. the atlas  <dig>  cdna microarray was used to screen for differential expression of  <dig> genes and significantly de-regulated genes were selected through image analysis. we further investigated whether the altered mrna and protein levels of a subset of deregulated molecules in the postischemic brain could be reproduced in an in vitro model of neuronal and endothelial cell culture under conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation . the findings confirmed previous studies reporting that parallel screening of gene expression can detect both previously documented and novel transcriptional features of the cerebral response to ischemia, and demonstrated significant differences in gene expression between human stroke and the animal model.

RESULTS
cdna microarray analysis
the expression of ischemia-related genes was determined by comparing the infarct-induced expression  to that in the contralateral hemisphere:  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were de-regulated in stroke-affected regions in the  <dig> patient survival groups respectively, while  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were altered at the  <dig> different time-points in the animal model compared to the controls . the combined number of differentially expressed transcripts in stroke patients represented  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively in each survival group of the total number of the genes on the microarray. these findings compare with  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 4%,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, 10% and  <dig> % of genes respectively at each time-point in rats.

in total,  <dig> genes were deregulated after stroke in humans and  <dig> in the rat mcao model. however, these data are not directly comparable since many transcripts in the human array were not present in the rat array and vice versa. out of a total of  <dig> genes present in both arrays,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed deregulated expression in the  <dig> patient groups respectively, whilst  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were deregulated at each of the  <dig> time-points respectively following rat mcao . of the  <dig> overlapping transcripts, the expression of  <dig> was changed only in the human study, compared with  <dig> that were altered only in the animal model, while only  <dig> deregulated genes were shared between the two studies. interestingly, the mean fold changes in the human data were much higher than in the rat.

amongst these genes we examined in more detail a small subset with no prior report of a role in stroke . pak <dig> was only induced in the human study although present in both microarray sets, mmp <dig> was induced in both cases, while ini <dig> was induced in the human but was not present in the rat microarray set. to confirm the microarray data, rt-pcr was carried out on selected deregulated genes. the temporal expression patterns of these genes following rt-pcr showed good agreement with the corresponding expression profiles obtained from the microarray analysis, supporting the validity of the data obtained from the microarrays. using western blotting and immunohistochemistry, pak <dig>  ini <dig> and mmp <dig> protein expression and localization was determined in the contralateral and ipsilateral brain areas of individual stroke patients and rats subjected to mcao, and in hbmec and hfn exposed to ogd and reperfusion.

integrase interactor  <dig> 
in agreement with the microarray data, rt-pcr demonstrated an increase in ini <dig> mrna levels in peri-infarcted and infarcted areas of patients who survived between  <dig> and  <dig> days following stroke . analysis of ini <dig> protein expression in samples from individual stroke patients showed that protein levels were increased in peri-infarcted and infarcted regions in  <dig> of  <dig> samples . only one patient who survived for  <dig> days after stroke showed decreased protein expression. cells from contralateral white matter were not stained for ini <dig> but some weak neuronal cytoplasmic staining was seen in grey matter . an increase in its expression was observed in the cytoplasm of cells with the morphological appearance of glia and microvessels from peri-infarcted and infarcted areas of patients surviving for  <dig> to  <dig> days after stroke . in the rat, rt-pcr and western blotting demonstrated no notable changes in ini <dig> mrna and protein expression respectively following mcao. weak cytoplasmic staining was observed in contralateral neurons but no differences in the level of ini <dig> neuronal expression occurred following mcao . finally, hfn and hbmec exposed to ogd and/or reperfusion showed no difference in mrna and protein levels for ini <dig> when compared with untreated cells.

matrix metalloproteinase  <dig> 
for mmp <dig>  rt-pcr data agreed with the findings from the microarray study, showing increased mrna levels in infarcted and peri-infarcted tissue from patients surviving 2– <dig> days following stroke . western blotting in individual patient samples demonstrated that  <dig> of  <dig> patients had elevated mmp <dig> protein levels . the majority of cells from contralateral grey and white matter were not stained for mmp <dig> . in patients surviving from  <dig> days to  <dig> weeks, endothelial cells and neurons from both infarcted and peri-infarcted tissue were stained positive for mmp <dig> . in the rat model, rt-pcr confirmed the microarray data for some of the time-points, showing no notable change in mrna levels at  <dig> and  <dig> h but a prolonged upregulation at  <dig> days following mcao . protein levels were elevated at  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> days, after which they returned to control levels. no staining for mmp <dig> was seen in contralateral areas , but an increase in its expression occurred in neurons following mcao, in particular at  <dig> and  <dig> h . mmp <dig> mrna and protein levels remained unchanged in hfn and hbmec exposed to conditions of oxygen-glucose deprivation.

p21-activated kinase  <dig> 
rt-pcr confirmed the upregulation of pak <dig> determined by the microarrays in pooled samples from stroke patients who survived between  <dig> and  <dig> days following stroke . western blotting showed an upregulation in the protein levels of pak <dig> in  <dig> of  <dig> patients . no staining was seen in contralateral white matter, while, in grey matter, pak <dig> stained weakly the cytoplasm of some neurons . in patients surviving for  <dig> days to  <dig> weeks after stroke, increased pak <dig> nuclear staining was seen in neurons in both peri-infarcted and infarcted regions . in the rat, rt-pcr showed no significant changes in the mrna levels for pak <dig> at most of the time-points examined. however, western blotting showed an upregulation in protein levels  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after mcao, returning to control levels at  <dig> days, and becoming downregulated at  <dig> days following mcao . weak staining was observed in neurons from the contralateral hemisphere , but an increase in cytoplasmic and nuclear staining in neurons occurred following mcao, in particular at  <dig> h and  <dig> h . finally, an increase in pak <dig> expression was also seen in human foetal neurons following oxygen-glucose deprivation .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
in the human brain, many differentially expressed genes were observed from  <dig> to  <dig> days and from  <dig> to  <dig> days after stroke, with the majority being upregulated. the number of deregulated genes declined during  <dig> to  <dig> days after stroke, indicating that dynamic changes in gene expression occur during the first days to few weeks in the human postischaemic brain. in the rat brain, few differences were observed at  <dig> hour, while the number of differentially expressed genes steadily increased with time after mcao, with a peak after  <dig> days, supporting the concept of active mechanisms initiated during the acute phase after experimental stroke and lasting for several days. the number of upregulated genes gradually increased, peaking at  <dig> days, while downregulated genes were detected  <dig> h after mcao and increased dramatically until the final measured time-point at  <dig> days .

the limitations of post-mortem brain samples in cdna microarray analysis concern the small sample size and potential low quality and the genetic heterogeneity and diversity in terms of age, sex and previous medical history within a group of patients  <cit> . we found that analysis of postischaemic gene expression using a cdna microarray can allow identification of known and novel transcriptional events, molecular participants and signalling mechanisms in cerebral ischaemia as previously suggested, but can also detect differences in gene expression between distinct organisms.

the present gene expression profile study is the first large-scale microarray report showing altered expression of several genes following human stroke. these included genes participating in transcription, apoptosis, inflammation and neuroprotection. many genes/proteins previously shown to be deregulated following stroke were reported in our study too e.g. il- <dig>  <cit> , pdgf  <cit> , stat <dig>  <cit> , mapk1/ <dig>  <cit> . to test whether our microarray analysis could predict novel candidate genes involved in the cerebral response to ischaemia with possible functional importance and significance in stroke-induced neuronal damage, we measured protein expression and cellular localisation for three induced genes, ini <dig>  pak <dig> and mmp <dig>  they were chosen because they showed at least 2-fold mrna induction and there was no prior published evidence implicating them in human cerebral ischaemia.

pak <dig> is a downstream rac effector and a major cyclin-dependent kinase  <dig>  substrate and target that co-localizes with p35/cdk <dig> at neuronal peripheries. p35/cdk <dig> causes pak <dig> hyperphosphorylation, which results in pak <dig> down-regulation and is likely to have an impact on the dynamics of the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in neurons during dendrite development  <cit> . based on this evidence, these authors proposed the existence of a neuron-specific signalling complex involving cdk5/p35-pak <dig> that inhibits pak <dig> activity in neurons. we have recently provided evidence for a potential role of cdk5/p <dig> in the response to ischaemic injury as we showed association of cdk <dig> with nuclear damage, by demonstrating co-expression of cdk <dig> in tunel-positive neurons following human stroke and in propidium iodide-positive human foetal neurons following ogd  <cit> . here, we have reported for the first time an upregulation in pak <dig> protein levels in human and rat brain samples following mcao and in hfn following oxygen-glucose deprivation. although in the animal model pak <dig> protein levels returned to normal  <dig> days following stroke, some patients showed elevated levels for pak <dig> at later time-points too. in both human and the animal model, neurons were the predominant type of cells stained positive for pak <dig> 

mmp <dig> or stromelysin- <dig> , first isolated as a breast cancer-associated protease, is not expressed in the majority of normal adult organs but is expressed during a number of pathological processes, including wound healing and atherosclerotic lesions  <cit> . although other metalloproteinases have been studied extensively following stroke  <cit> , there is no report of the expression of mmp <dig> following stroke in vivo or in vitro. here we report an increase in protein levels of mmp <dig> following stroke in both human and rat brain, although the increase seen in man remained elevated much longer. although mmp <dig> shares many similarities with other mmps, it also differs in that it exhibits anti-apoptotic properties, a first-known activity for a mmp  <cit> . moreover, although it is expressed in many processes involving tissue remodelling, cell migration and cell death, the pathways through which it participates in pathogenesis remain unclear, largely due to the lack of information on its substrates in vivo  <cit> .

ini <dig> is a tumour suppressor gene, thought to exert its tumour suppressor function by mediating cell cycle arrest  <cit> . it was initially identified as a human homolog of yeast transcriptional activator snf <dig> that binds to the hiv- <dig> integrase and stimulates its dna-joining activity  <cit> . brains of aids patients had been shown to manifest neuronal injury and apoptotic-like cell death raising the question about the way hiv- <dig> resulted in neuronal damage, since neurons themselves are very rarely infected by the virus  <cit> . adler et al.  <cit>  also reported an association of the human snf5/ini <dig> protein with growth arrest and dna damage-inducible protein  <dig>  that mediates growth arrest and apoptosis in response to stress signals  <cit> . our study is the first to suggest a potential role for ini <dig> in pathways activated after stroke with a possible role in brain injury. however, in the animal model study, ini <dig> levels remained unchanged following stroke. the reason for this discrepancy warrants further studies.

many experimental trials of stroke therapies have failed to translate to human clinical trials and one possible way to improve the success rate can be through comparative genomics. as it has been recently commented, it is very surprising that the exciting developments observed in basic and clinical stroke research over the past two decades have occurred in parallel, with too little direct translation between bench and bedside  <cit> . here, we have provided substantial evidence that, although the available animal models of mcao may well be suitable to study the pathophysiological changes following the occlusion of a cerebral vessel, they may not entirely reflect the pathophysiological process through which stroke evolves in humans. the species difference is one of the main reasons accounting for the lack of success of bench to bedside translation in the stroke area. limitations of our study include the fact that early acute phase changes in gene expression may have been missed since genes induced and returning to normal during the first  <dig> hours post-ischaemia in man could not have been detected. moreover, since we analyzed pooled rna samples, small changes in gene expression occurring in a minority of the samples may have been missed. however, there was only a small overlap of our results with prior studies in experimental stroke involving brain tissue, and the successful identification of novel ischaemia-related genes reported here suggests that performing a further study using whole genome microarrays would be valuable.
