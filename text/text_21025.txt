BACKGROUND
coccidioidomycosis or valley fever is caused by a dimorphic fungus: coccidioides posadasii or c. immitis. due to high virulence, both of the coccidioides species: c. posadasii and c. immitis have been included in the national institute of allergy and infectious disease 's list of biodefense pathogens and in the center for disease control 's list of select agents. coccidioidomycosis is endemic in areas of southwest us, mexico and several countries of south america. the infection is initiated by inhalation of air-borne arthroconidia. an insufficient cell-mediated immunity promotes the formation of parasitic-phase endosporulating spherule structures in lung and hematogenous spread of organisms into non-pulmonary organs leading to more severe disseminated coccidioidomycosis  <cit> . the disseminated infection causes increased morbidity and mortality, specifically in people with immunocompromised conditions. african-americans, fillipinos and pregnant women are also at a high risk of developing disseminated coccidioidomycosis  <cit> . among all the endemic fungal infections, coccidioidomycosis has generated a great interest in vaccine development because a prior infection engenders immunity, a large number of relapses and clinical failures are reported with the use of conventional antifungal-agents, the disease produces a significant burden of morbidity, the rate of infection is increasing in endemic areas  <cit> , and most importantly, coccidioides poses a risk of bioterrorism  <cit> .

as is evident from the studies in patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis and animal models, the susceptibility to the disease is related to defective t cell-immune responses  <cit> . an effective antigen-presentation by antigen-presenting immune cells is a critical step in engendering protective t cell responses. among a variety of cells, the dendritic cells  are the most potent antigen-presenting cells. as such, suppressed dc responses are evidently associated with defective t cell responses in patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis  <cit> , and in susceptible mouse strains, such as balb/c mouse strain  <cit> . unlike other antigen-presenting immune cells, dcs migrate to lymph nodes, and activate naïve immune cells including t cells. based on this property, dc-based vaccines have been evaluated in animal models of a variety of infections as well as cancer. some of the dc-based vaccines are currently undergoing pre-clinical/clinical trials for aids and different types of cancer  <cit> ; a therapeutic dc-vaccine  was recently approved by food and drug administration  for the management of prostate cancer  <cit> . our laboratory's focus is on developing a dc-based vaccine for coccidioidomycosis  <cit> .

the success of a dc-based vaccine depends on multiple factors, including type of antigen, loading efficiency of dcs with antigen, route of administration, trafficking, and the ability to express protective antigen in vivo, interact with naïve immune cells and activate effector immune cells. in a previous study, we reported a dc-vaccine prepared by genetically transfecting the immortalized myeloid jaws ii dcs  with a plasmid dna encoding coccidioides-ag2/pra-cdna   <cit> . furthermore, we showed its protective efficacy as a prophylactic vaccine in reducing the fungal load in syngeneic c57bl <dig> mouse strain that is moderately susceptible to c. posadasii infection  <cit> . the study provided a proof-of-principle that the non-virally, genetically-transfected dcs can help reduce the fungal load  <cit> . based on these initial results  <cit> , we have now prepared a vaccine using primary myeloid dcs. besides the possibility of the altered immunostimulatory characteristics of primary dcs in different mouse strain, it is also important to note that an immortalized dc cell line may not be used in clinical scenario. it is also expected that an autologous primary dc-based vaccine will be easily translatable and more feasible as a therapeutic vaccine. here we used balb/c mouse strain because it is extremely susceptible to coccidioidomycosis, and coccidioides-infected balb/c mice present immunological features  similar to those observed in patients with disseminated disease  <cit> . since the efficacy and functions of dc-vaccination depends primarily on dc-phenotypes, it is important to evaluate the phenotype, stability of antigen expression, in vivo trafficking, antigen presentation and t cell stimulating potential of primary dcs. with these criteria in mind, a dc-vaccine was prepared using balb/c mice-derived primary dcs by genetically-transfecting with a plasmid dna containing coccidioides-ag2/pra-cdna; the phenotype and antigen-presentation were studied. to enable in vivo monitoring of dcs by pet imaging, the dcs were co-transfected with hsv <dig> thymidine kinase cdna. the image-derived biodisposition of administered dcs assisted in focusing on select organs for further evaluation of memory t cell populations and ag2/pra-specific responses.

RESULTS
morphology and phenotype of primary dcs and jaws ii dcs
the yield of primary dcs of balb/c and c57bl <dig> mice on day  <dig> and day  <dig>  varied from 6%-20% of total harvested bone marrow cells. more than 98% of dcs remained viable on day  <dig> and day  <dig> of harvesting. morphologically, 2ddc and 4ddc as well as jaws ii cells showed immature phenotype. there was no difference between the primary dcs originating from either c57bl <dig> or balb/c mouse strains. similar to the jaws ii dcs, the primary dcs did not possess tentacles or dendrite-like structures . when the cells were allowed to continue differentiating for  <dig> days in presence of gm-csf and il- <dig>  the dcs developed typical morphology of mature dcs characterized by the appearance of dendrite structures on their cell surface.

the immunophenotype of harvested primary dcs was confirmed by flow-cytometry. the primary dcs were found to be negative for cd <dig> , cd <dig>  and cd45ra , and this negativity continued through the duration of the experiment. we confirmed the myeloid or plasmacytoid nature of primary dcs by staining with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies: siglech, pdca <dig>  120g <dig>  cd62l, b <dig> and cd11c. as evident from negative or negligible staining for siglech, cd62l, b <dig>  the primary dcs and jaws ii dcs were mainly of myeloid phenotype. at the same time, the primary dcs and jawsii dcs were very low positive for pdca <dig> and 120g <dig> markers demonstrating again that they were not of plasmacytoid type .

the jaws ii dcs as well as 2ddc and 4ddc showed positive staining for cd11c, mhc class ii and t cell co-stimulatory molecules . however, we observed that compared to jaws ii dcs, the expression of these cell surface markers on primary 2ddcs increased in a time-dependent fashion up to  <dig> days of monitoring . based on these observations, we decided to use 2ddcs for downstream experiments.

immunophenotype and transgene expression in transfected dcs
next we investigated whether the primary dcs transfected with plasmid dnas encoding transgenes expressed the respective proteins, and maintained their immunophenotype. the dna transfection efficiency of primary dcs ranged from 30-40% which is within 10% of the transfection efficiencies previously reported by us in jaws ii dcs  <cit>  . the viability of primary dcs after transfection ranged from 52% -81%  as compared to 68% for jaws ii dcs  <cit> . no significant changes were observed in the cell-surface expression cd11c, mhc class ii, cd <dig>  cd <dig> and cd <dig> by primary dcs post-transfection . the morphology also remained unaltered . similarly, the primary dcs co-transfected with pvr1012-ag2/pra-cdna and pvr1012-tk did not show any changes in cell-surface expression of dc-markers or morphology .

we confirmed the expression of ag2/pra and hsv1-tk proteins by dot-immunoblotting of cell-lysate of primary dcs co-transfected with pvr1012-ag2/pra-cdna and pvr1012-tk .

cytokine secretion by transfected dcs
after characterizing the transfected primary dcs for their phenotype, we measured the levels of various cytokines in cell-free supernatants. no significant changes were observed in secreted amounts of tnf-α, il- <dig>  il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> .

primary dcs transfected with pvr1012-ag2/pra-cdna induce activation of both cd4+ and cd8+ t lymphocytes
the primary goal of dc-vaccines is to stimulate lymphocyte-mediated immunity. therefore, we investigated whether the transfected primary dcs are capable of activating homologous lymphocytes in vitro. we harvested cells after  <dig> h of dc-lymphocyte co-culture for flow cytometric analysis. the cells were stained with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies against cd <dig>  cd <dig> , cd <dig> and cd <dig>  and analyzed by 4-color flow cytometry. our results suggest that the balb/c-derived primary dcs induce activation of both cd4+ and cd8+ t cells . the induction of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells was more pronounced with jaws ii dcs as compared to balb/c mice-derived primary dcs. the concavalin-a activated splenic lymphocytes, dcs and lymphocytes alone served as controls in these experiments .

molecular imaging of primary dcs in a mouse model
after comparing the morphology, immunophenotype, expression of the epitope, cytokine release and t cell-stimulatory characteristics of pvr1012-ag2/pra-cdna-transfected primary dcs, we extended our study to investigate the trafficking of primary dcs. we used an hsv1-tk/18f-fiau system to image the distribution of transfected primary dcs in a syngeneic mouse model.

uptake of fiau by jaws ii dcs transfected with pvr1012-tk
first, we determined the hsv1-tk enzyme activity in dc cell lysates based on their ability to phosphorylate 3h-pencyclovir and 18f-fiau substrates. we found that the hsv1-tk-expressing primacy dcs phosphorylate these substrates, and the phosphorylated substrate retained on the filter . in cellular uptake studies, we found that hsv1-tk-transfected jaws ii dcs accumulated  <dig>  folds more 18f-fiau . overall, the results suggest that hsv1-tk-transfected dcs express an active tk enzyme that is capable of phosphorylating and retaining 18f-fiau substrate.

in vivo trafficking of primary dcs
for a successful dc-vaccine, it is important that the cells traffic through or home into the areas where they can present the antigens to naïve immune cells. also, for an adequate immune response the persistence of the dcs in the body for a reasonable time period is also essential. based on our previous published results  <cit> , we intranasally instilled about  <dig>  million transfected primary dcs in syngeneic mice. the instilled dcs were previously co-transfected with coccidioides-ag2/pra-cdna and pvr1012-tk. for the sake of simplicity, we will call the group of mice instilled with coccidioides-ag2/pra-cdna+pvr1012-tk plasmid transfected dcs as 'dc-vaccine group'; similarly, the mice that received dcs transfected with vector plasmid dna are called 'control'. we studied the homing of dcs in live mice using pet-ct imaging after  <dig> and  <dig> days of dc administration. co-registration of ct assisted in ascertaining anatomical landmarks on the fused images . in both 'dc-vaccine' as well as 'control' groups on day  <dig>  the images did not show significant accumulation of radioactive probe in the mice bodies. however, the pet images acquired on 7th day showed a significant accumulation of 18f-fiau in lung and liver of 'dc-vaccine' as compared to 'control group' .

biodistribution
on day  <dig> after the imaging was accomplished, the mice were euthanized to collect various organs and fluid specimens. the organs were weighed and 18f-radioactivity was counted. the biodistribution data confirmed the pet-ct imaging results. there was significantly more radioactivity in all the organs harvested from 'dc-vaccine' group as compared to the 'control' group. due to the difficulty in normalizing intestine- and stomach-associated radioactivity by weight, we report the amount of radioactivity in entire organ for these two organs. while intestine did not show significant difference between the two groups, stomach of 'dc-vaccine' group accumulated higher amounts of radioactive probe than the 'control' group. the differences were more pronounced in lung, thymus and blood  in the two groups .

memory t cell phenotypes and ag2/pra-specific response
after assessing the trafficking of the primary dc-vaccine, the t cell phenotypes were enumerated in lymphoid organs: spleen, thymus and lymph nodes. we found that there was a slight decrease or no change in number of cd4+ and cd8+ tcm and resting memory cell populations, respectively, with simultaneous increase in tem populations in splenic lymphocytes and lymph node cells of vaccinated mice . however, no significant difference was observed in the number of activated  cells.

results are from one representative experiment  performed thrice.

finally, we assessed the ag2/pra-specific t cell response in lung, thymus and lymph node cells harvested from vaccinated mice. we found that a significant number of lung and lymph node cells derived from vaccinated mice secreted ifn-γ in response to ag2/pra challenge. however, there was no significant difference in numbers of il- <dig> and il-17a-secreting cells .

discussion
here, we present our recent data on primary bone-marrow-derived dcs genetically-transfected with coccidioides-ag2/pra in balb/c mouse strain that is most susceptible to coccidioides infection. compared to our earlier study on immortalized jaws ii dcs  <cit> , the transfection efficiency, viability and immunophenotype of primacy dcs was essentially identical. the transfected primary dcs expressed almost similar levels of gfp, ag2/pra and tk protein for at least up to  <dig> h of transfection under in vitro conditions . these results confirmed that a non-viral method is equally efficacious for genetic transfection of primary dcs as had been observed for immortalized jaws ii cells  <cit> . empirically, the generation of a protective immune response by a dc-based vaccine depends mainly on its phenotype and antigen-presenting functions that may differ among the mouse strains  <cit> . therefore, we studied basic phenotypic characteristics, antigen-presentation, in vivo trafficking of primary dc-based vaccine in balb/c mouse strain and the ability of primary dc-based vaccine to induce antigen-specific t cell response.

our results suggest that primary dcs are morphologically similar to jaws ii dcs under resting conditions . at phenotypic level, we found that the primary dcs were mainly of myeloid dc type, like jaws ii dcs, but there were slight differences in the expression pattern of certain cell-surface markers. for instance, the expression of cd11c, mhc class ii and cd <dig>  was more pronounced on the cell-surface of primary dcs as compared to jaws ii dcs . the difference in expression pattern of myeloid dc-specific markers may be due to the differences in culture conditions. as noted above, jaws ii dcs were maintained in culture medium containing gm-csf only, whereas the primary dcs were cultured in the presence of gm-csf as well as il- <dig>  earlier, jiang et al., found similar differences in the expression of cd11c, mhc ii and cd <dig> between resting jaws ii dcs and c57bl <dig> mice-derived primary dcs  <cit> .

under in vitro culture-conditions, the dcs mature over a period of time  <cit> . thus, the timing of dc culture and harvest needs optimization on case-by-case basis. since we did not observe any significant difference between the antigen presenting ability of the 2ddc and the 4ddc, we used 2ddc for genetic transfection and immunization. we also observed that cd11c, mhc class ii and t cell co-stimulatory molecules  continued to increase in primary dcs from day  <dig> to  <dig>  based on these comparisons of phenotypic and functional analysis, we chose 2ddcs for antigen-presentation and downstream in vivo immunization experiments. we believe that it may ultimately be beneficial in clinical scenarios to obtain the starting material, i.e., primary dcs within  <dig> days of seeding the bone marrow cells in dc-promoting culture conditions.

we further studied the functional activity of primary dc-vaccine by dc: t cell co-culture assay. the activation of autologous cd4+ and cd8+ t cells was evident in co-culture assays . however, the expression of cd <dig> and cd <dig> was more pronounced in cd4+ and cd8+ t cells co-cultured with c57bl6-derived jaws ii vaccine as compared to balb/c-derived dc- vaccine. we were intrigued by this finding and decided to explore the cytokine secretion. we observed no significant difference in cytokine  secretion by pvr1012-ag2/pra-cdna transfected primary dcs as compared to similarly transfected jaws ii dcs. it is however, apt to mention that we, and others, have found significant differences in dc-responses against coccidioides in different mouse strains, specifically balb/c versus dba/ <dig> and c57bl <dig> versus dba/ <dig>  <cit> . differences in immune responses elicited by different immunization strategies against mycobacterium tuberculosis  <cit>  and porphyromonas gingivalis  <cit>  have also been reported in c57bl <dig> and balb/c mouse strains. it appears that host genetic factors may be responsible for the differences in antigen-recognition and immune responses in the two mouse strains.

the entire in vitro work discussed thus far pointed towards an effective primary dc vaccine. the first step to realizing this in vivo is to study the distribution and homing of dcs in appropriate tissues and activation of antigen-specific immune response. to accomplish their biological functions, the dcs undergo a complex pattern of migration which includes their localization to both peripheral non-lymphoid tissues and secondary lymphoid organs. in the absence of correct tissue localization, the dcs fail to promote proper immune responses  <cit> . thus, we studied the trafficking and homing pattern of primary dc-vaccine in balb/c mouse strain. the short-term trafficking aspect has already been addressed for a c57bl6-derived jaws ii vaccine in a syngeneic c57bl <dig> mouse model in our earlier study  <cit> . in our published study, we labeled the jaws ii vaccine with 111in radionuclide and followed the trafficking of cells for a period of  <dig> h using spect . however, we noted some technical limitations with 111in-spect for dc-trafficking. one, it does not ensure the integrity of radiolabel and dc association in vivo, second the resolution is poor, and lastly it allows imaging only up to 3- <dig> days. to overcome these limitations, here we used a molecular pet imaging approach. this is the first time we have been able to study dc-trafficking in vivo up to  <dig> days of administration. similar approach however, has been used for imaging the migration of other immune cells and stem cells over a period of  <dig> days  <cit> . the pet-ct images and the subsequent biodistribution studies suggested that after intranasal administration, significant number of dcs accumulate in lung, thymus and blood. although the life-span of endogenous dcs is believed to be short, it is not exactly known how long the dcs survive in vivo after administration  <cit> . our results suggest a likelihood that the primary dc-based vaccine can circulate in the body for at least  <dig> days of immunization.

finally, we questioned if the homing of intranasally-administered dc-based vaccine in lung and lymphoid organs is sufficient to induce antigen-specific t cell response and memory. sufficient evidence exists to support the fact that generation of immunological memory is important for a long-term protection  <cit> . using a multi-color flow-cytomteric approach, we found a consistent increase in the number of cd4+ and cd8+ tem cell population in vaccinated mice suggesting that the dc-vaccine induces an immunological memory. since the conversion of naïve t cells to memory cells is a dynamic process and involves multiple steps, our efforts will be to investigate the time-dependent analysis of memory t cell distribution. the increased secretion of ifn-γ by lung and lymph node cells correlates well with our previously published results on increased levels of ifn-γ in lung tissue homogenates of dc-vaccinated, coccidioides-protected mice  <cit> . our findings may have direct clinical relevance because the reduced levels of ifn-γ cytokine and t cell anergy are associated with disseminated coccidioidomycosis in human patients and animal models  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results suggest that the primary dc-vaccine can be prepared by using a simple method of nonviral genetic-transfection, first developed in our laboratory  <cit> . after intranasal administration, the dc-vaccine migrates to both lymphoid and non-lymphoid organs, induces antigen-specific th <dig> response, and generates memory t cells. efforts are underway to further evaluate maintenance of immune responses and memory on long-term basis and efficacy of dc-vaccine in coccidioides infection model in balb/c mouse strain. as described earlier, the coccidioides-specific dc responses and resulting t cell functions are disabled in the balb/c mouse strain making them highly susceptible to coccidioides infection  <cit> ; the adoptive transfer of dc-vaccine may restore the immunocompetence and contribute to a protective t cell response in infection model.
