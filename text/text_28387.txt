BACKGROUND
the type vi secretion system  was first identified in the human pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and vibrio cholerae and was shown in the latter to function as an injectisome for the delivery of pathogenicity effector proteins into the host cell  <cit> . t6ss have since been identified in genome sequences of many gram negative bacteria, including those of several animal and plant pathogens, but also in symbiotic and free-living bacteria  <cit> . this has led to the speculation that the t6ss is involved in other non-pathogenic functions including inter-bacterial communication, regulating biofilm formation and environmental stress response  <cit> . in the animal pathogens salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium and helicobacter hepaticus mutational analysis indicated that the t6ss suppresses virulence and promotes replication in host cells, thus contributing to long-term colonization  <cit> . in other bacteria, including the animal pathogen yersinia pestis and the phytopathogen pectobacterium atrosepticum, this increased proliferation has been hypothesized to result in increased fitness and, subsequently, increased virulence  <cit> . the t6ss of the plant symbiont rhizobium leguminosarum has been linked to host-specificity, where a t6ss deletion mutant of a strain restricted to trifolium subterraneum  acquired the ability to form nitrogen-fixing nodules on the non-host pisum sativum   <cit> . several authors have identified an antibacterial role for the t6ss. a secreted effector, tse <dig>  in p. aeruginosa has been shown to have toxic effects on other bacteria  <cit> . furthermore, the t6ss effectors tse <dig> and tse <dig> represent lytic enzymes that degrade peptidoglycan in the cell walls of closely related gram negative bacteria  <cit> . similarly, bactericidal functions have been ascribed for t6sss in v. cholerae  <cit>  and s. enterica  <cit> . the availability of more genome sequences and more experimental data will facilitate a greater understanding of new and known functions of the t6ss. several bacteria encode multiple t6ss loci on their genomes. for example, the genomes of p. aeruginosa, y. pestis and burkholderia pseudomallei encode three, four and six t6ss loci, respectively  <cit> . these seemingly non-paralogous loci, together with the divergent functions of the t6ss suggests that this secretory system could influence a variety of interactions within a single species, with various hosts, and/or with other bacteria occupying the same niche  <cit> .

while the biological roles of the t6ss in many gram negative bacteria still need to be elucidated, other aspects of this secretory system, including evolutionary, genetic, structural and regulatory facets are becoming better understood. t6ss loci are generally comprised of 15- <dig> genes and include a core of  <dig> conserved proteins, which assemble the t6ss apparatus in the cell membrane  <cit> . these conserved proteins include icmf  and dotu , which have homology to proteins associated with the type iv secretion system and are thought to stabilize the t6ss apparatus in the cytoplasmic membrane  <cit> . an aaa+ atpase, clpv  may energize the assembly of the apparatus. other conserved proteins include the duf <dig>  and duf <dig>  proteins, which are predicted to function as chaperones and the cog <dig> outer membrane lipoprotein  <cit> . the outer component of the t6ss apparatus is comprised of two proteins, vgrg  and hcp , which have also been identified as secreted effectors of the t6ss  <cit> . these proteins resemble both structurally and genetically the components of the t <dig> bacteriophage tail spike, suggesting that the vgrg-hcp combination forms a similar membrane penetrating structure and are evolutionarily related  <cit> . hcp proteins form hexameric rings that are conceivably stacked to form a tube penetrating the outer membrane through which proteins are transported into the extracellular space  <cit> . the vgrg protein is postulated to puncture the outer cell membrane to allow extrusion of the hcp tube and subsequently breach the host cell membrane  <cit> .

vgrg proteins have been demonstrated to be secreted by the t6ss and are themselves required for the secretion of other effector proteins, such as the tse <dig> effector in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . however, a vgrg protein in this organism has been shown to be secreted in a t6ss-independent manner  <cit> . this indicates that the vgrg proteins are distinct and may perform diverse functions. some vgrg proteins have been found to carry c-terminal extensions, which carry conserved domains of various predicted functions. the n-terminal of these "evolved vgrgs" may serve in assembly of the t6ss machinery, while the c-terminal portion functions as effector  <cit> . one such evolved vgrg in v. cholerae  carries an actin-binding domain in its c-terminal extension which has been shown to be involved in host cell toxicity  <cit> . the c-terminal extension of a vgrg in s. enterica subsp. arizonae  carries an s-type pyocin domain which has been proposed to function in bacterial cell killing  <cit> . over  <dig> vgrg orthologs have been identified in bacterial genome sequences with many of these representing evolved vgrgs. in a number of organisms for which genome sequences are available, additional hcp and vgrg paralogs with a function in t6ss, termed "orphan" hcps and vgrgs are encoded by genes located on the genome separately from the t6ss loci  <cit> .

the genera pantoea and erwinia include ecologically diverse species, including the plant pathogens erwinia amylovora and pantoea stewartii subsp. stewartii, which are linked to devastating diseases of rosaceous plants and maize, respectively  <cit> . the opportunistic plant pathogen pantoea ananatis causes disease on a broad range of host plants and has been associated with human bacteremia  <cit> . several erwinia species, including erwinia billingiae and erwinia tasmaniensis, are found as part of the normal epiphytic microflora of plants  <cit> . strains of pantoea agglomerans and pantoea vagans have recently received attention as potent biological control agents  <cit> . strains of both pantoea and erwinia have also been isolated from insects  <cit> . the complete and draft genomes of several pantoea and erwinia species have recently been sequenced, which provide an extensive base to identify genomic differences that may be linked to the divergent biological and ecological phenotypes of these species. we used the genome sequences to identify the t6ss in these organisms. an in depth analysis was undertaken which showed that not all t6ss loci are universal to the sequenced pantoea and erwinia species and that there are notable anomalies between some of the loci that are conserved among the compared organisms. we show that these differences occur in putative genomic islands associated with the hcp and vgrg proteins and postulate that these islands represent regions of rapid and extensive evolution, which may drive functional diversification of the t6ss.

RESULTS
several orthologous t6ss loci occur in pantoea and erwinia species
by means of baiting with the conserved proteins from several characterized t6ss in other bacteria, between two and four t6ss loci were identified in the complete or draft genome sequences of five pantoea and four erwinia strains . these strains were the eucalyptus pathogen p. ananatis lmg  <dig>  <cit> , the biological control strains p. vagans c9- <dig>  <cit>  and p. agglomerans e <dig> , the insect-associated strains pantoea sp. ab-valens  <cit>  and pantoea sp. at-9b  <cit>  which represent novel species of the genus pantoea, the fire blight pathogens e. amylovora cfbp  <dig>  <cit>  and e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t  <cit>  and the apple epiphytes e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig>  <cit>  and e. billingiae eb <dig>  <cit> . two orthologous loci are found in all pantoea and erwinia strains, while a more restricted distribution could be observed for the t6ss- <dig> locus . additional t6ss loci were identified in the genome sequences of e. billingiae eb <dig> and pantoea sp. ab-valens, respectively.

the t6ss- <dig> loci range in size from  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb and are built around a well-conserved and syntenous core which includes orthologs of all sixteen conserved t6ss proteins identified by boyer et al.  <cit>  . additional genes encode a serine/threonine protein kinase  and serine/threonine phosphatase . these proteins interact with the fork head-associated  domain protein  for the post-translational regulation of the t6ss  <cit> . in both pantoea and erwinia strains the conserved core t6ss proteins are arranged in two syntenous clusters . these are separated by a variable region , which is linked to the hcp gene . a further variable region occurs next to the vgrg gene . in all sequenced pantoea and erwinia genomes, with the exception of e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t, this variable region is flanked at the 3' end by a gene encoding a re-arrangement hot spot  element  <cit> . in p. agglomerans e <dig>  e. amylovora cfbp  <dig>  e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t and e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig>  an additional copy of the vgrg gene occurs within this variable region. a non-conserved region harboring two hypothetical genes, which is not associated with a vgrg or hcp gene could be observed between cog <dig> and clpv in e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> and e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t .

the t6ss- <dig> loci of the pantoea strains and e. billingiae eb <dig> are structurally and genetically conserved and consist of eight syntenous genes which encode proteins that are highly conserved among the sequenced strains . only four of these belong to conserved t6ss proteins outlined by boyer et al.  <cit> , suggesting the t6ss- <dig> loci encodes a partial and potentially non-functional t6ss. an average amino acid identity of 52% could be observed between the proteins encoded in the t6ss- <dig> locus and their respective paralogs in the t6ss- <dig> locus for each of the strains. this suggests that the t6ss- <dig> locus could have arisen through a partial duplication of the t6ss- <dig> locus. this is supported by phylogenetic analysis with the icmf  protein sequences , where the t6ss- <dig> loci branch from the t6ss- <dig> loci. the e. amylovora cfbp  <dig> and e. pyrifoliae dsm12613t t6ss- <dig> loci encode only four proteins, lacking the genes encoding the serine/threonine kinase and phosphatase required for posttranslational regulation, while an fha domain  protein is encoded in these loci. the icmf gene in the e. pyrifoliae dsm12613t t6ss- <dig> locus is inactivated by a frameshift  <cit> , while the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> t6ss- <dig> locus is missing the fha domain gene, indicating further gene loss in these t6ss loci .

the pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> loci are between  <dig>  and  <dig>  kb in size and encompass  <dig> to  <dig> protein coding sequences. in contrast to the t6ss- <dig> and - <dig> loci, the t6ss- <dig> locus is not universal to all pantoea and erwinia strains . the phylogeny based on the icmf protein shows a greater evolutionary distance between the pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> loci, which are interspersed with those of other enterobacteriaceae , indicating that this locus may have been acquired through horizontal gene transfer. this can also be correlated with greater diversity in gene content and order between the various pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> loci . thirteen of the t6ss conserved core proteins identified by boyer et al.  <cit>  are encoded within the t6ss loci. genes encoding orthologs of the cog <dig>  cog <dig> and fha domain  proteins are absent. no ppka or pppa orthologs are encoded in the t6ss- <dig> loci either, suggesting that this locus is not post-translationally regulated. as in the case of the t6ss- <dig> loci, syntenous blocks of core genes can be observed in the t6ss- <dig> loci . here, the hcp gene is included in a conserved block . the non-conserved regions in the t6ss- <dig> loci are generally associated with a vgrg gene. an additional complete and two partial vgrg genes can be found in the t6ss- <dig> locus of e. amylovora cfbp  <dig>  an additional non-conserved region, encoding two predicted proteins, pana_ <dig> and pana_ <dig> can be observed in the p. ananatis lmg  <dig> t6ss- <dig> locus .

a further t6ss locus was identified in pantoea sp. ab-valens . this  <dig>  kb locus encodes thirteen conserved core proteins. the icmf phylogeny shows this t6ss locus to be distantly related to all other pantoea and erwinia t6ss loci. similarly, an additional partial t6ss locus is encoded on the e. billingiae eb <dig> genome, which contains four t6ss core proteins. a non-conserved region associated with the vgrg gene is likewise present. this e. billingiae eb <dig> t6ss locus is flanked at both the 5'  and 3' end  by genes of an integrated phage element. a phage origin has previously been hypothesized for the t6ss  <cit> .

different vgrg proteins are encoded in the t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig> loci and additional t6ss loci
the amino acid sequences of all vgrg proteins encoded in the t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig> and additional t6ss loci in e. billingiae and pantoea sp. ab-valens were analyzed for the presence of conserved and evolved domains. the n-terminal region of all t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig> and additional t6ss vgrg proteins is conserved among all pantoea and erwinia species and contains a conserved vgrg  and phage gp <dig>  domain . however, as has been observed in other bacteria, the vgrg proteins differ considerably in length between the various pantoea and erwinia species. this can be attributed to variable c-terminal regions, which suggest that they represent evolved vgrg proteins. seven of the thirteen pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins contain such c-terminal extensions . analysis of these c-terminal extensions showed that several of them contain conserved domains. the p. agglomerans e <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg <dig> protein  contains a peptidoglycan -binding domain  as well as cog <dig> and cog <dig> lysozyme domains  <cit> , which were also found in the lytic bacteriophage φ <dig>  suggesting a bacteriolytic function for this vgrg protein. a similar function can be expected for the pantoea sp. ab-valens t6ss- <dig> vgrg  which contains a β-n-acetyl-glucosaminidase domain  in its c-terminal extension. the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg <dig>  c-terminal extension shows structural homology to the streptomyces sp. n <dig> chitosanase   <cit> .

the c-terminal extensions of vgrg proteins encoded in the t6ss- <dig> loci of all pantoea and erwinia species contain a conserved domain of unknown function , which is absent in the t6ss- <dig> loci vgrg proteins . this domain has also been identified flanking the n-terminal region of the s. enterica subsp. arizonae iiia vgrg proteins, while it is not present in the vgrg proteins of other salmonella serovars  <cit> . a role for the cog <dig> domain, which links the n-terminal vgrg transporter and c-terminal extension, in modulating the function of the vgrg between secretion and virulence has been suggested  <cit> . however, with the exception of the p. agglomerans e <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg protein, which carries a c-terminal extension subsequent to the cog <dig> region, no further c-terminal extensions are present in the pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins. an alternative function in host cell adhesion has also been suggested  <cit> . the latter function would imply that the cog4253-positive t6ss- <dig> and cog4253-negative t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins could have different targets and serve different functions. a phylogeny based on the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins shows that they branch into two distinct clades suggesting distinct evolutionary backgrounds for these paralogous proteins . the vgrg protein found in the additional t6ss locus in e. billingiae eb <dig> also contains a conserved cog <dig> domain and clusters with the t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins, while the additional pantoea sp. ab-valens vgrg paralog clusters with the other vgrg proteins lacking this domain.

non-conserved hcp/vgrg regions represent islands within the t6ss loci
while the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> loci share conserved and syntenous cores among the various pantoea and erwinia strains, considerable variability in the vgrg and hcp regions can be observed. the g+c deviation across these t6ss loci was determined. this showed that for the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> loci, there is a much lower g+c content in the variable regions associated with the hcp and vgrg genes compared to the conserved core regions . in the t6ss- <dig> loci, the conserved core regions had an average g+c content of  <dig> % across all strains, while the hcp regions  and vgrg regions  had a much lower g+c content. the substantial g+c deviations, variability in the gene content of the hcp and vgrg regions and the differential homology of proteins encoded in these regions to proteins in bacteria in other genera indicates that these regions represent variable islands within the t6ss loci. similar g+c deviations could be observed for the vgrg regions in the additional pantoea sp. ab-valens and e. billingiae eb <dig> t6ss loci, which further supports that these regions serve as "hot spots" for rearrangement  <cit> . these hot spots are frequently associated with rhs proteins which are capable of displacing its c-terminal tip and replacing it with a non-homologous alternative. by this means, the rhs protein can drive the sequential insertion of heterogeneous c-terminal sequences into the hot spot  <cit> . as the additional e. billingiae eb <dig> t6ss locus occurs within an integrated phage element, we postulate that transducing phages may play a role in the horizontal acquisition of non-conserved genes in the vgrg and hcp regions. similar vgrg/hcp islands have also been identified in a number of pseudomonas species  <cit> . these islands are associated with "orphan" vgrg and hcp paralogs separately located from the remainder of the t6ss loci. in contrast, this is the first observation of hcp and vgrg islands associated with the conserved core t6ss loci. analysis of the t6ss loci of other bacteria , however, shows that this phenomenon is not restricted to pantoea and erwinia.

hcp/vgrg islands harbor putative effector proteins
the proteins encoded in the variable hcp and vgrg islands in the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> loci in the different pantoea and erwinia species were analyzed for sequence similarity and structural homology to known proteins and the presence of conserved domains. the majority of proteins encoded on the islands showed homology to proteins of unknown function. however, a number of island proteins share high sequence identity and contain conserved domains which suggest they may represent t6ss effectors with putative functions in host-microbe and inter-bacterial interactions .

the amino acid sequence of eta_ <dig> encoded in the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg island shares homology with a phospholipase in v. cholerae he <dig>  while that of e. billingiae eb <dig> ebc_ <dig> encoded on the t6ss- <dig> vgrg island shows homology to a lipase/esterase in yersinia bercovieri atcc  <dig> . the former also shows structural homology to a p. aeruginosa lipase  while the latter shows structural homology to a lipase in penicillium expansum , supporting that these two proteins represent lipases. similarly, ebc_ <dig> encoded in the additional t6ss of e. billingiae eb <dig> shares weak structural homology with a lipase in archaeoglobus fulgidus . lipases hydrolyze long-chain triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerol and have been shown to represent major virulence factor in both animal and plant pathogens  <cit> . genes encoding lipases were also identified in the vgrg islands of p. aeruginosa and transcriptome analysis showed that their expression is co-regulated with that of the t6ss  <cit> . these lipases may therefore represent t6ss-secreted effectors in p. aeruginosa as well as the erwinia species. several genes in the vgrg regions of both pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> loci may encode proteases. the p. agglomerans e <dig> pagg <dig> and e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> eta_ <dig> proteins share 28% and 32% aa identity respectively with a putative zinc protease in acinetobacter baumanii  and show weak structural homology to a zinc metalloproteases in geobacter sulfurreducens . furthermore, the p. agglomerans e <dig> pagg_ <dig>  e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> eta_ <dig> and e. amylovora cfbp  <dig> eamy_ <dig> protein sequences show weak structural homology to the secreted cysteine protease stathopain , which plays a role in skin infection by staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . ebc_ <dig> and ebc_ <dig> localized in the vgrg island in the additional t6ss locus of e. billingiae eb <dig> encode proteins with weak structural homology to the secreted clostridium perfringens sialidase nani  which is involved in the removal of sialic acids from host glycoconjugates with an important role in bacterial nutrition and pathogenesis  <cit> . pana_ <dig> associated with the t6ss- <dig> in p. ananatis lmg  <dig>  shares high sequence homology with the m <dig> peptidase of klebsiella sp. 92- <dig>  and extensive structural homology to the secreted chitinase g of streptomyces coelicolor of . chitinases degrade chitin, the carbohydrate polymer found in insect shells and the cell walls of fungi, suggesting the t6ss of p. ananatis lmg  <dig> may secrete an effector with an antifungal or insecticidal function  <cit> .

two proteins, pana_ <dig> and pagg_ <dig>  encoded in the t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> hcp islands of p. ananatis lmg <dig> and p. agglomerans e <dig>  respectively contain conserved peptidoglycan binding  and lysm  domains which are typically associated with proteins involved in bacterial cell wall degradation. the latter also shows sequence homology to a putative lytic enzyme in acinetobacter calcoaceticus ruh <dig> . similarly, e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t epyr_ <dig> shares sequence homology with a edwardsiella tarda fl6- <dig> lysozyme  and also contains a conserved peptidoglycan binding domain  and a domain of unknown function  frequently observed in lysozymes. the e. billingiae eb <dig> ebc_ <dig> protein also shares sequence homology with the pseudomonas phage pap <dig> endolysin . the presence of domains conserved in bacterial cell wall degrading enzymes and the sequence homology to these enzymes indicate that these proteins may play a similar role to the tse <dig> and tse <dig> lytic enzymes in p. aeruginosa in the degradation of the bacterial cell wall and may thus have a bactericidal function  <cit> . furthermore, pana_ <dig> encoded in the additional non-conserved region in the p. ananatis lmg  <dig> t6ss- <dig> locus shows extensive sequence homology to s-pyocin domain containing proteins in e. coli 3030- <dig>  and yersinia pseudotuberculosis ip  <dig>  and shows weak structural homology to the colicin s <dig> of escherichia coli . similarly, weak structural homology to colicin s <dig> can be observed for the t6ss hcp island p. vagans c9- <dig> pvag_ <dig>  pantoea sp. at-9b pat9b_ <dig> and pantoea sp. ab-valens panabdraft_ <dig> proteins . colicins and pyocins are bacteriocins that are involved in killing closely related bacterial species  <cit> . the presence of bacteriocin-like proteins in the t6ss loci of these pantoea species agrees with the finding of a potential function for the t6ss in antibiosis and competition  <cit> .

pantoea and erwinia vgrg and hcp proteins may carry effector proteins encoded in the vgrg and hcp islands
analysis of the g+c contents of the pantoea and erwinia t6ss- <dig> vgrg genes shows that the n-terminal regions, which contain the conserved vgrg and gp <dig> domains, have an average g+c content of  <dig> %, which is similar to the conserved core of the t6ss- <dig> loci. by contrast, the c-terminal extensions have an average g+c content of  <dig> %. this is similar to the non-conserved vgrg island, suggesting that the c-terminal extensions form part of the vgrg islands. in the t6ss- <dig> loci, the conserved n-terminal region of the vgrg genes has an average g+c content of  <dig> % while the vgrg islands have an average g+c content of  <dig> %.

some of the proteins encoded in the vgrg islands show sequence homology and contain conserved domains found in the c-terminal extensions of evolved vgrg proteins. the e. pyrifoliae dsm 12163t t6ss- <dig> epyr_ <dig> amino acid sequence shares 75% aa identity with the c-terminal region of the p. agglomerans e <dig> t6ss- <dig> evolved vgrg . the p. ananatis lmg  <dig> t6ss- <dig> pana_ <dig> and the c-terminal region of the evolved t6ss- <dig> vgrg of p. agglomerans e <dig>  also each contain a pg-binding domain and a lysm domain  found in lytic enzymes, and show structural homology a cell wall degrading lysozyme in pseudomonas phage phikz . blastp analysis with the proteins encoded in the vgrg islands against the ncbi protein database showed that proteins encoded in the vgrg islands of several pantoea and erwinia species show substantial sequence identity to the c-terminal extensions in vgrg in bacteria belonging to other genera . the putative lytic enzymes encoded in the t6ss- <dig> vgrg islands of p. ananatis lmg  <dig>  and e. billingiae eb <dig>  share homology with the c-terminal extensions in the vgrg proteins of v. cholerae tma <dig>  and v. cholerae ct 5369- <dig> , respectively. the putative zinc proteases encoded in the p. agglomerans e <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg island  and the e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> t6ss- <dig> vgrg island  share  <dig> and 46% aa identity with the c-terminal extension of a burkholderia sp.  <dig> vgrg protein . similarly, the putative e. tasmaniensis et1/ <dig> lipase  shows 42% aa identity to the burkholderia glumae bgr <dig> vgrg . the sequence homology and the presence of shared conserved domains between the c-terminal extensions of evolved vgrg proteins and putative effector proteins encoded in the vgrg islands, suggest that vgrg proteins may carry effector proteins encoded in the vgrg islands. the cog <dig> conserved domain found at the c-terminal end of all the t6ss- <dig> vgrg proteins may be involved in the anchorage of the vgrg transporter to the effector proteins, thereby modulating the function of the vgrg protein as a structural component of the t6ss apparatus and the transport of effector proteins  <cit> . this domain is absent in the t6ss- <dig> loci, and the means by which effectors become associated with the vgrg transport region would need to be determined.

in the fish pathogen edwardsiella tarda, the secreted effector protein evpp has been shown to interact with the hcp protein  <cit> . furthermore, hcp orthologs with c-terminal extensions have been identified in s. enterica, which may represent evolved hcp proteins  <cit> . it is therefore plausible that, as is the case for the pantoea and erwinia vgrg proteins, the hcp proteins may transport effector proteins encoded on the hcp islands. by this means, various effector proteins could be tagged to the vgrg and hcp proteins, thereby forming different vgrg-effector and hcp-effector combinations, which may perform different biological functions. the vgrg or hcp proteins could transport bacteriocins or pyocins, which would allow the bacterium to target other bacteria competing for an ecological niche. a chitinase effector carried by the vgrg protein could play an antifungal or insecticidal role in the pantoea and erwinia species. these and other putative pathogenicity factors encoded by hypothetical proteins in the hcp and vgrg islands translocated by the vgrg and hcp proteins may therefore enable pantoea and erwinia species to target a range of bacterial, invertebrate, vertebrate and or plant hosts.

CONCLUSIONS
comparative analysis of the genome sequences of several pantoea and erwinia species revealed that they encode between two and four t6ss loci. this suggests an important biological role for this secretion system in these two genera. two of the t6ss loci, t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig> are shared among all pantoea and erwinia strains, while orthologs of the third locus are only found in four of five pantoea species and two of four erwinia species, suggesting acquisition by horizontal gene transfer of this locus. pantoea sp. ab-valens and e. billingiae eb <dig> encode additional t6ss loci. analysis of the t6ss- <dig>  t6ss- <dig> and additional loci in pantoea sp. ab-valens and e. billingiae eb <dig> showed that while synteny is conserved among the pantoea and erwinia species for each locus, non-conserved regions could be observed associated with the hcp and vgrg genes. the g+c contents of these non-conserved regions differ substantially from the conserved portions of the loci, indicating horizontal acquisition of these regions separate from the rest of the t6ss loci. several of the vgrg proteins encoded in the loci have a c-terminal extension and represent evolved vgrg proteins. these c-terminal extensions likewise have lower g+c contents than the remainder of the t6ss suggesting they form part of the vgrg islands.

many of the proteins encoded in the vgrg and hcp islands carry conserved domains and show sequence and structural homology to proteins with various biological functions including antibiosis, fungal cell wall degradation and putative roles in animal and plant pathogenesis. we postulate that the vgrg and hcp islands may represent evolutionary hot spots for genes that encode effector proteins. similar rearrangement hot spots have been observed in the regions adjacent to the hcp and vgrg genes in the t6ss loci of other bacteria  <cit> , suggesting that this is a more widespread phenomenon. the sequence similarity and structural homology of some of these putative effector proteins to c-terminal extensions in characterized evolved vgrg proteins suggest that they may become tagged to the conserved core vgrg proteins which serve as transporters for these effectors, thereby forming new evolved vgrg proteins. similarly, putative effectors encoded in the hcp islands may become associated with the hcp proteins to form evolved hcp proteins. we could therefore speak of "evolving" hcp and vgrg proteins. by tagging various effector proteins different vgrg-effector and hcp-effector combinations could be formed which may perform different biological functions. thereby, the genomic islands associated with the hcp and vgrg proteins could drive functional diversification of the t6ss, which may explain the plethora of biological roles described for this secretion system.
