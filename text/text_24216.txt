BACKGROUND
the burden of bacterial dysentery due to shigellosis continues to be a major concern affecting more than  <dig> million people annually. s. flexneri is the primary cause of endemic shigellosis prevalent in the developing countries, and is the most frequently isolated species world-wide
 <cit> .

in s. flexneri, the o-antigen structure of the lps, is one of the key virulence determinants required for its pathogenesis and protection against the host defence
 <cit> . the o-antigen of s. flexneri, with the exception of serotype  <dig>  consists of a polysaccharide backbone comprised of the repeating tetrasaccharide units , and modifications to the basic o-antigen backbone by the addition of glucosyl, o-acetyl, or phosphoethanolamine groups to one or more sugars, give rise to various different serotypes of s. flexneri
. to date at least  <dig> serotypes of s. flexneri have been identified
 <cit> .

the genes responsible for glucosylation of s. flexneri o-antigen, gtra, gtrb and gtr, are arranged in a single operon known as the gtr cluster
. whereas, the acetylation is mediated by a single gene ‘oac’ encoding o-acetyltransferase
 <cit> . while the glucosylation is known to occur on any of the sugar residues, oac-encoded o-acetylation occurs at position  <dig> of rhai residue. additionally, the glucosyl or the o-acetyl modification genes are carried by bacteriophages, which mediate serotype-conversion by integrating into the host chromosome
 <cit> . six such serotype converting phages have been identified: sfi, sfii, sfiv, sfv, and sfx, which encode the gtr gene cluster, and sf <dig> which encodes the oac gene
. in contrast to the phage-encoded glucosylation and o-acetylation, the phosphoethanolamine modification at position  <dig> of rhaii and/or rhaiii, is encoded by a plasmid-borne opt gene
 <cit> .

recently, new sites for the o-acetylation of s. flexneri o-antigen have been identified. these are o-acetylation at position  <dig>  and  <dig>  of rhaiii  in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a, y,  <dig> and 6a, and at position  <dig> of glcnac in serotype 2a, 3a, and y
. moreover, the degree of 3/4-o-acetylation has also been shown to vary between the ranges 30-70%  and 15-30% , within the strains of one serotype
 <cit> . another recent study revealed that the 3/4-o-acetylation modification in s. flexneri is mediated by the oacb gene, which was shown to be carried by a transposon-like structure located upstream of the adra gene on the chromosome
 <cit> . in this study, we report the isolation and characterisation of a novel bacteriophage sf <dig>  from a wild type serotype 7a strain, and show for the first time that oacb gene was located on the intact genome of the prophage, sf <dig>  the complete genome sequence of the sf <dig> phage was determined. comparative genomics used for highlighting important genetic similarities with other lambdoid phages indicated that the sf <dig> phage has a mosaic genome and sf6-like genome architecture. analysis of a specific chromosomal integration site for phage sf <dig> revealed that the phage integrates into the sbcb locus, thus identifying a new site for the integration of the serotype converting phages of s. flexneri, and a new location of oacb in s. flexneri chromosome. additionally, this study also identified oacb gene in several serotype 7a isolates from various geographical regions, suggesting that the 3/4-o-acetylation modification is not uncommon in serotype 7a of s. flexneri.

methods
bacterial strains, bacteriophage and media
the induction of bacteriophage sf <dig> from serotype 7a s. flexneri strain sfl <dig> was performed using uv irradiation protocol described by adam et al.
 <cit> . bacteriophage stocks were prepared by picking a single plaque, propagating on serotype y strain 
 <cit> , and precipitating phage using polyethylene glycol, as described in sambrook et al.
 <cit> . s. flexneri strain sfl <dig>  lacking the 3/4-o-acetylation on the rhaiii was used as host for sf101-oacb functional analysis. e. coli jm <dig> was used for cloning experiments.

bacteria were grown in luria–bertani  broth or lb agar supplemented with chloramphenicol  or erythromycin  when appropriate. nzcym broth was employed for routine propagation of phage.

the purified phage was absorbed on carbon-coated copper grids, negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid  and visualized with a hitachi h <dig> transmission electron microscope.

host range determination
the host range of phage sf <dig> was determined as described previously
 <cit> . briefly, different dilutions of phage stock were made in sm buffer; 5-10 μl of each dilution was then spotted on required bacterial lawn on an agar plate. lytic activity  was examined following overnight incubation at 37°c.

sequencing of phage genomic dna
the purified sf <dig> phage dna was sequenced using the ion torrent pgm  <dig> chip  at the australian genome resource facility, university of queensland. the reads generated were assembled into contigs using clc genomics workbench . to close the gaps between the contigs and re-sequence the regions of low-quality, the desired segments were pcr amplified using phage dna as template and the purified pcr products were sequenced as described above.

analysis of sequence
open reading frames were determined using clc main workbench  and ncbi orf finder program. genes within orfs were predicted based on homologies to the known genes found by blastn and blastp searches and the presence of shine-dalgarno ribosome binding sites. the rho-independent terminators were identified using arlond terminator finding program
 <cit>  and trnascan-se search server was used to scan for trna
 <cit> .

the protein level alignments were performed using clustalw
 <cit>  and bioedit sequence alignment editor
 <cit> . the accession numbers for the phages used for comparative genomics were: cus- <dig> , sf <dig> , hk <dig> , mep <dig> c- <dig> , sfx , mep <dig> , mep <dig> , p <dig> , epsilon <dig> , ime <dig> , hk <dig> , phage  <dig> .

RESULTS
isolation of sf101
a novel bacteriophage named sf <dig> was induced and isolated from serotype 7a, strain sfl <dig>  phage sf <dig> formed clear, round plaques when plated onto the indicator strain sfl <dig> . in order to confirm that sfl <dig> is the host strain of sf <dig> phage, southern hybridization of hindiii digested genomic dna of the host, using dig-labelled sf <dig> as a probe was performed. results confirmed the presence of phage genome integrated into the host chromosome .

morphology of sf101
electron microscopic examination of sf <dig> phage preparation revealed that it has an isometric head  and a short tail  . according to the morphological classification of bradley, these characteristic features are typical of phage in the c group morphology of the family podoviridae and order caudovirale
 <cit> . among the other serotype converting phages of shigella, appearance of sf <dig> phage resembles phage sf <dig> and sfx
 <cit> .figure  <dig>

host range
twelve serotypes  of s. flexneri were tested for sensitivity against sf <dig> phage. together, sf <dig> was able to infect  <dig> serotypes: 1a, 1b, 3b and y. interestingly, we observed some differences in the phage ability to form plaques on different serotypes. sf <dig> plating efficiency was similar on serotypes y and 1a; however, it was  <dig> fold lower when plated on serotypes 3b and 1b. in a number of short-tailed phages, adsorption is mediated by an initial reversible binding of the phage to bacterial lps, followed by an irreversible attachment of the phage to an unknown secondary receptor, the presence of which has been found to be necessary for infection. recently, ompa and ompc were identified as the secondary receptors for bacteriophage sf <dig>  and were shown to dramatically affect the rate and efficiency of bacteriophage sf <dig> infections
 <cit> . bacteriophage sf <dig> being similar to sf <dig> might also require presence of secondary receptors for infection, and the difference in the plating efficiencies observed might be due to mutation in the secondary receptors of these strains.

genome properties and organisation
the complete genome of sf <dig> phage was sequenced using  <dig> chips on an ion torrent pgm, producing an average read length of approx. 125 bp. a total of approx.  <dig>  reads were generated which were then de-novo assembled into  <dig> major contigs using clc genomics workbench . the accuracy of the contigs was verified by mapping the reads back to the contigs. the regions of ambiguity and the gaps between the contigs were then addressed by targeted sanger sequencing to obtain a single contiguous sequence.

the complete genome of sf <dig> phage consists of  <dig>  bp, with the overall g + c content of  <dig> %. a total of  <dig> protein coding genes with a plausible shine-dalgarno sequence were predicted from the genome sequence. among which  <dig> orfs are transcribed from the sense strand and  <dig> are on the antisense strand. the majority of the orfs initiate translation with an atg, whereas only  <dig> start with gtg. the sizes of the gene products varied from  <dig> a.a. to  <dig> a.a.

the translated orf products were also compared with known protein sequences using blastp . based on the similarities,  <dig> out of  <dig> orfs were assigned putative functions, while the other  <dig> orfs exhibited similarity to uncharacterised proteins. the overall genetic organisation of sf <dig> phage , consisting of "dna packaging and structure - serotype conversion - regulation – recombination - replication – nin and the lysis region", suggested that this phage is a member of lambdoid family. additionally, the layout of the genes was similar to that of previously sequenced serotype converting shigella phages sf <dig> and sfx.figure  <dig> 
genome map and integration site of phage sf <dig>   the sf <dig> genome is shown with a scale in bp. orfs are represented by arrows oriented in the direction of transcription. putative functional modules are indicated above the arrows. black knobs below the scale depict the rho-independent terminators and the attachment site of the phage  is indicated with a blue vertical arrow.  schematic representation of phage sf <dig> integrative recombination where attp on the phage genome recombines with the attb within sbcb gene of s. flexneri chromosome to form the two junction’s recombination sites attl and attr. arrows p <dig>  and p <dig>  on the map indicate the primers used in the pcr.



the sf <dig> genes were generally tightly spaced occupying  <dig> % of the genome. however, there were several large  apparently non-coding regions within the genome . although no trna genes were identified in these or other locations by using a trna scanning program, several putative rho-independent transcription terminators were identified and are shown in figure 
2a.

relationship to other phages
initial whole genome blast of phage sf <dig> against the ncbi database showed that bacteriophage sf <dig> is related to several lambdoid phages originating from various hosts, like s. flexneri, e. coli and salmonella. to better understand the relatedness, comparison of proteins encoded by sf <dig> phage to those of the  <dig> most related phages was carried out. figure 
 <dig> shows that most of the proteins encoded by the phage sf <dig> were >90% identical with proteins from previously characterised lambdoid phages. moreover, the genome of phage sf <dig> is highly mosaic with the left half of the phage most homologous to e. coli phage cus- <dig> and the right half most homologous to phage sf <dig> and hk <dig> figure  <dig> 
comparison of sf <dig> with related phages. proteins encoded by sf <dig> phage were compared with those of  <dig> other lambdoid phages from e. coli, s. flexneri and salmonella. the coloured arrows represent the level of amino acid sequence identity between sf <dig> protein and its counterpart in other phages. the red and green colours indicate >90% and >80% identity, respectively. the purple arrows on sf <dig> map represent proteins with no phage-borne homologue.



the module containing dna packaging and structural proteins is the largest module of the sf <dig> phage, and is predicted to contain  <dig> orfs . while the packaging proteins of sf <dig> were identical to sf <dig>  most of the proteins responsible for phage head assembly shared >90% identity with their counterparts in cus- <dig> . one of the exceptions was orf <dig> in the head completion module. orf <dig> with two other genes of the module encode for proteins required for stabilizing the phage head after dna gets loaded in it. although, orf <dig> shared only 50% identity with its equivalent in cus- <dig>  it was found to be >90% identical to its homologue in phage p <dig>  the major difference between cus- <dig> and sf <dig> head morphogenesis proteins, was in the dna injection module. sf <dig> orf <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  forming this module showed only 85%, 34% and 32% identity to their equivalents in cus- <dig>  in general, the injection proteins are known to be more variable than the rest of the virion assembly proteins because these proteins are released by the virion during dna injection and function in the host during or after the injection
 <cit> .

orf <dig> of sf <dig> encodes the tail spike protein that adsorbs to the cell receptors  of the host. analysis of the tail spike protein of sf <dig> phage revealed conservation in the amino terminal portion than in the carboxyl terminal region. the amino terminal residues were homologous to the cognate amino acid residues of cus- <dig>  sf <dig>  sfx, and epsilon <dig> . however, very limited homology was observed between the carboxyl terminal residues. the reason for this could be that the amino terminal domain of the p <dig> like tail spikes are known to bind to virion head and is therefore more conserved. the carboxy terminal domain, on the other hand, contains the o-antigen binding site and so is specific for each phage
 <cit> . the integrase of phage sf <dig>  shared 99% identity with the integrases of hk <dig>  mep <dig> and phage  <dig>  moreover, further analysis of sf <dig> genome sequence has revealed a 13 bp sequence  located upstream of the int gene, that is, identical to the attp of phage 2851
 <cit> . while the integration sites and attp sequence of hk <dig> and mep <dig> are not known, phage  <dig> has been shown to integrate in the sbcb locus
 <cit> . the extremely high similarity of the sf <dig> phage attp and int protein to those of phage  <dig> suggested that the integration site of sf <dig> phage must be at the sbcb locus, identical to phage  <dig>  we amplified and sequenced one of the sf <dig> prophage-bacterial genomic junctions that spans between sf <dig> orf <dig> and sbcb gene . a 3 kb sequence was obtained in which 13 bp attl sequence was identified; thus confirming the integration of sf <dig> phage into the 5’ end of sbcb gene . this is unlike all the other known serotype-converting phages of s. flexneri which are known to integrate either into the agrw or thrw trna gene
.

the early and regulatory regions located in the right half of the genome shared homology to cus- <dig>  sf <dig>  hk <dig>  mep043c- <dig>  mep <dig>  mep <dig> and hk <dig>  however, the proteins of regulation and the replication module were most similar  to their cognates in hk <dig> and mep043c- <dig>  respectively. the nin region of the sf <dig> phage  was identical to that of phage hk <dig>  with ninx being the only exception showing only 43% identity. moreover, nin e, f, g, h, and i of sf <dig> phage were also conserved in sf <dig>  mep <dig>  mep <dig> and hk <dig> phages.

the antitermination q and a set of predicted lysis genes lie downstream of the nin region. the lysis module of phage sf <dig> is typical of lambdoid phages, consisting of holin, anti-holin, lysin, rz and rz <dig> proteins . additionally, orf <dig> of sf <dig> phage lies inside orf <dig>  in a second reading frame, as in other lamdoid phages
 <cit> . homologues of holin, anti-holin, lysin, and rz were seen in all the phages shown in figure 
 <dig>  except for phage p <dig> and phage  <dig>  in contrast, equivalents of rz <dig> of phage sf <dig> were only present in cus- <dig>  sf <dig>  p <dig> and epsilon <dig>  to the right of the lytic cassette, orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encoded proteins which shared >90% identity with their homologues in sfx and sf <dig>  whereas orf <dig> encoded rha family protein was identical to its cognate in phage cus- <dig> 

novel genes of sf <dig> phage
sf <dig> phage proteins encoded by orfs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were identified as proteins with no known phage-borne homologues. whilst orf <dig> and  <dig> shared similarity with uncharacterised proteins of e. coli, orf <dig> had no homologue in e. coli or shigella and showed limited homology with proteins from saprospira grandis and bipolaris maydis. blastp results of orf <dig> revealed that it is an acyltransferase family protein, sharing 99% identity with the protein encoded by gene sf <dig>  of s. flexneri 2a str  <dig>  oacb has recently been shown to confer the 3/4-o-acetylation modification of rhaiii of s. flexneri o-antigen
 <cit> .

pairwise alignments of sf <dig> orf <dig>  with the oacb at the dna and protein levels were carried out. the analysis identified three base substitutions  in the sf101-oacb. while the first mutation had no effect at the protein level, the other two mutations resulted in two amino acid substitutions in sf101-oacb: a <dig> to v and v <dig> to i . since, a, i and v are all neutral amino acids with similar structure, it was expected that these mutations will impose minimum effect on the function of oacb. this was verified by performing nmr spectroscopy experiments.

confirming the function of sf101-oacb
in order to confirm the function of sf101-oacb, we first analysed the lps of the sf <dig> host  by 1h nmr spectroscopy. results revealed nmr resonances at δh  <dig>  and  <dig>  indicating the presence of o-acetyl groups
 <cit> . oacb gene from sf <dig> phage was then cloned into a plasmid  and introduced into a serotype 7a strain , which was pcr negative for oacb gene, to create a recombinant strain sfl <dig>  the 1h nmr spectrum acquired on the lps of strain sfl <dig> revealed resonances, inter alia, at δh  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> ; however, nmr signals were absent in the spectral region for o-acetyl groups for the sfl <dig> lps.

lps of strains sfl <dig> and sfl <dig> were then treated by dilute aqueous acetic acid and purified by size exclusion chromatography to obtain the polysaccharide materials . the 1h nmr spectra of these ps showed resonances, inter alia, at δh  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   for the sfl <dig> strain  and at δh  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   for the sfl <dig> strain, indicating partial o-acetyl substitution. the o-acetyl substitution position were then determined by performing the 1h,1h-tocsy experiments employing an array of mixing times of increasing lengths, which have proven to be particularly powerful at unraveling the spin-systems of the sugar residues and subsequently the o-acetyl substitution position
 <cit> . using mixing times in the range 10–120 ms, the 1h,1h-tocsy spectra of the ps from strain sfl <dig> revealed, inter alia, spin systems originating from δh  <dig>   to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , from δh  <dig>   to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , as well as from δh  <dig>   to  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   . the 1h,1h-tocsy spectra of the ps from strain sfl <dig> were closely similar, and taken together these results were fully consistent with the nmr data reported by wang et al.
 <cit>  for partial o-acetyl substitution at positions o <dig> and o <dig> of rhaiii in o-antigens from other s. flexneri serotypes. thus, o-acetylation was present to about 1/ <dig> at o <dig> and to about 1/ <dig> at o <dig> in the two strains investigated herein.figure  <dig>

identification of conserved residues and motifs of oacb
blastp results of sf101-oacb also revealed that this protein shared some homology with acyltransferases from other species. all the homologues were grouped under the superfamily cog <dig> . multiple alignment of the sf101-oacb with  <dig> of its homologues from various species was carried out for identification of the conserved residues and motifs. results of alignment  showed several conserved motifs: dgxrgxlaxxvxxhh, ffxitglfxxk, wxlxyewxfy and ysxylxhg , present at similar positions of the proteins. the first  <dig> motifs were found in the amino terminal part of the protein while the fourth one was in the carboxy terminus. several other conserved amino acids were also identified in close proximity to these motifs. the high levels of conservation of various amino acid motifs suggests that they may be involved in specific conserved functions.

distribution of oacbin s. flexneri7a strains
the 3/4-o-acetyl modification observed in this study was in a serotype 7a strain. however, serotype 7a is known to lack any o-acetyl modification to date
 <cit> . thus, several serotype 7a isolates from different regions  were screened to identify a possible 3/4-o-acetylation modification. as the antiserum specific for 3/4-o-acetyl modification was not available, a pcr screening of  <dig> serotype 7a strains with oacb specific primers was performed. as shown in table 
 <dig> the expected pcr product was amplified from  <dig> out of  <dig> strains . the sequencing of the pcr product from the positive strains revealed that the oacb gene sequence in  <dig> strains  was identical to oacb of sf <dig> phage . however, the oacb gene in the other  <dig> strains was almost identical to oacb from s. flexneri 2a str  <dig> except a base substitution at position  <dig>  which resulted in i <dig> to m mutation in the oacb protein of all  <dig> strains. however, as i and m are neutral amino acids, this mutation is expected to have no effect on the function of oacb. these results suggest that the 3/4-o-acetyl modification in serotype 7a is not uncommon. moreover, in order to determine if oacb gene in these 7a strains was carried by sf <dig> phage, pcrs targeting three different regions of sf <dig> phage  were performed on the above  <dig> oacb positive strains. results revealed that  <dig> out of the  <dig> tested strains carried complete sf <dig> phage suggesting this phage may have contributed in the dissemination of the oacb gene in 7a strains .table  <dig>

integration site of sf <dig> phage suggests that the oacb gene in sf <dig> lysogens is located in the sbcb locus. however, the reported site for oacb gene in serotype 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a and y is upstream of the adra gene 
 <cit> . thus, the location of oacb gene in the  <dig> oacb positive serotype 7a strains was determined by performing pcr using primer specific for oacb gene and adra. results indicate that the location of oacb in the sf <dig> lysogen was the sbcb locus, while in the other  <dig> strains oacb was located upstream of the adra gene. change in the chromosomal position of oacb from sbcb to adra locus is likely due to disruption of the prophage by is elements and mobilization of oacb due to the combination of  <dig> or more is elements flanking oacb. this hypothesis is supported by our analysis of the region flanking sbcb gene in  <dig> previously sequenced s. flexneri genomes obtained from the ncbi database. results revealed that the region upstream of sbcb gene is extremely variable containing insertion elements in all, and sf <dig> like int in  <dig> out of  <dig> strains. taken together, our analysis indicate that a possible presence and disruption of sf <dig> phage by is elements could have resulted in the mobilization of oacb in some and loss in the other strains. additionally, wang et al. have also reported that the oacb gene located upstream of adra in serotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 5a & y was carried by a transposon-like structure
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this study reports the isolation and characterisation of a novel bacteriophage sf <dig> from s. flexneri serotype 7a strain. complete genome sequence of sf <dig> phage was determined and found to contain functional oacb gene making it a serotype converting phage of s. flexneri. the comparative genomic analysis of sf <dig> to  <dig> other lambdoid phages revealed that bacteriophage sf <dig> has a highly mosaic genome and sf6-like genome organisation. sf <dig> was found to integrate in the sbcb locus representing a new genomic location of oacb gene in sf <dig> lysogen. additionally, this study for the first time identified oacb gene in several serotype 7a isolates from different regions, providing evidence of 3/4-o-acetylation modification in serotype 7a of s. flexneri. these findings will further our understanding on the serotype converting phages of shigella which will be useful in comprehending the role these bacteriophages play in the survival of s. flexneri in the environment and human host.
