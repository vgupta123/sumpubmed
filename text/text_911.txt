BACKGROUND
arabian peninsula, situated at the nexus of africa, europe and asia, has been implicated in early human migration route out of africa and in early inter-continental trade routes  <cit> . the state of kuwait is situated at northwestern tip of persian gulf and is bordered by iraq and saudi arabia. kuwaiti population is composed of early settlers from different regions in and around arabian peninsula namely persia, saudi arabia and the deserts on the fringes of the peninsula. genetic features characterize kuwaiti population into these three migratory subgroups  <cit> .

the persian subgroup is composed of people of west asian  descent  <cit> . iran, centrally located in the asian continent, has served for centuries as gateway for movement of human population across diverse spheres of asia and europe. iran is home to one of the major ancient civilizations and has rich cultural and social diversity  <cit> . iranian population consists of diverse ethnic and linguistic groups namely arabs, armenians, assyrians, azeris, baluchis, gilaks, mazandarani, kurds, lurs, persian, turkmen and zoroastrians. y-chromosome haplogroup studies also placed iran at the nexus of tri-continental human migration and as a constant recipient of gene flow from the three continents  <cit> . the persian subgroup of kuwaiti population migrated into kuwait from southwestern iran and settled much before the establishment of modern-day kuwait, the first group arriving around the second half of eighteenth century  <cit> .

the  <dig> genomes project  <cit>  has illustrated that as high as 53% of rare variants  are observed only in individual populations, and that 17% of low-frequency variants  are observed in single ancestry groups. thus, it is essential to sequence diverse global populations, such as those that are underrepresented  in global genome-wide surveys, to enlarge our knowledge on human genome diversity.

kuwait genome project  is an initiative to sequence individual genomes from three genetically distinct subgroups of kuwaiti population at high coverage. in this paper, we report whole genome sequence of an individual from the persian subgroup of kuwaiti population  at >37x coverage. we catalog a total of  <dig> , <dig> single nucleotide polymorphisms ,  <dig>  short insertions/deletions  of length ≤ 50 bp, and  <dig>  structural variations. the identified variants include deleterious and loss-of-function coding variants, as well as critical non-coding variants that are associated with phenotype traits. we illustrate how the medical history of the sequenced individual  and of the family members  is reflected in the identified genome variants. the reported genome sequence, which can be used as ancestry specific genome for discovering additional variants  <cit> , and genome variants add to the human variome diversity and may serve as terminus a quo for larger sequencing projects on this population group of persian origin.

RESULTS
participant information and alignment statistics
a male participant aged 70 years, with self-reported history of type  <dig> diabetes and β-thalassemia  otherwise leading an active lifestyle was randomly selected from the persian subgroup  of kuwaiti population . the participant’s surname lineage traces back its ancestry to a region in southern iran and thus is in accordance with genetic clustering. the participant’s family is settled in kuwait for at least  <dig> generations. participant was further seen clustered with exomes of west asian origin from the state of qatar  <cit>  . the participant did not report any history of cardiovascular disorders or other major ailments.

a total of  <dig> , <dig>   reads of 101 bps in length were generated covering human genome at  <dig> x. overall,  <dig> , <dig>   of the reads were mapped to reference human genome properly - i.e. the output of the sequence alignment/map  tool for these mapped reads indicate that the reads aligned properly according to the aligner. out of  <dig> , <dig>  mapped reads,  <dig> % reads were mapped in proper pairs,  <dig> , <dig> reads were singletons and  <dig> , <dig> reads had their mates mapped to different chromosomes .

y-chromosome and mitochondrial haplogroups of the participant
the participant belongs to l1c  y-chromosome haplogroup and hv <dig>  mitochondrial haplogroup. all three subgroups of l , l1b , and l1c ) are present in iran and pakistan  <cit> . l1a is the most common subgroup found in india and l1b  is rarest of the three in south asia. l1c haplogroup is seen, though in low frequencies , in the northern part of the middle east . it has been observed in  <dig> % of the  <dig> male participants recruited to study y-chromosome variation in modern iran  <cit> . this haplogroup is also observed in pashtun tribes from afghanistan  <cit> . the hv mitochondrial haplogroup has a west eurasian origin and is found throughout west asia and southeastern europe, including iran, anatolia , the caucasus mountains of southern russia and the republic of georgia  <cit> . thus, the identified y-chromosome and mitochondrial haplogroups are consistent with the persian ancestry of the participant.

observed single nucleotide polymorphisms  and indels
a total of  <dig> , <dig> snps and  <dig>  indels  were identified through comparing kwp <dig> genome with human reference genome   <cit> . the number of reported snps is in concordance with mean of  <dig> , <dig> snps as seen in sequencing  <dig> malay genomes using similar technology and at similar coverage  <cit> .

of these variants,  <dig>   snps and  <dig>   indels are ‘novel’. this set of novel variants includes  <dig>  snps and  <dig>  indels having alleles not reported in dbsnp  <dig>  <cit> . the size distribution of the novel indels is similar to that of the known indels . the genome-wide transition/transversion ratio is  <dig>  for known snps and  <dig>  for novel snps . the observed value in the case of novel snps at  <dig>  is lower than the expected range of ~ <dig> - <dig> ; this can be due to one or a combination of the following reasons: possibility of residual false positives, possibility of a relative deficit in transitions due to sequencing context bias, or because of the apparently higher transition ratio often associated with low frequency variants  <cit> .figure  <dig>

annotation of snps and indels based on genomic locations
the identified snps and indels were classified into thirteen broad classes based on their genomic locations . in addition, the variants from coding regions were classified into thirteen classes based on their locations in exonic regions and their effects on protein sequences . most of the known and novel variants lie in intergenic regions.table  <dig>

a set of  <dig> known exonic variants were annotated as lof  variants. this includes  <dig> snps and  <dig> indels which result in premature stops, splice-site disruptions and frame shifts. the number of identified lof variants is consistent with previous reported average of  <dig> to  <dig> in  <dig> genomes project  <cit> . of these  <dig> exonic lof variants,  <dig> variants  and  <dig> indels ) are homozygous alternate leading to complete loss of function. interestingly, none of the identified  <dig> novel exonic lof variants  are homozygous alternate. previous studies have also shown at least  <dig> lofs in homozygous state in a healthy individual  <cit> . a higher number of homozygous lofs could be due to high inbreeding coefficient of  <dig> , as estimated in our previous study  <cit> , and tradition of consanguineous marriages in the family of participant.

allele frequency analysis, using data from  <dig> genomes project, of  <dig>  homozygous exonic lof snps showed that  <dig> of these snps are rare variants  ; thus it can be safely inferred that these lof mutations are genuine and are not sequencing artifacts. furthermore, out of  <dig> lof homozygous snps,  <dig> are annotated as expression quantitative trait loci  in various populations  <cit>  . these  <dig> homozygous lof variants lie in  <dig> genes. clustering of these genes based on gene function using david  <cit>  did not result in any significant cluster classification.

we further report  <dig>  known  and  <dig> novel snps  that are predicted to be “deleterious”; these deleterious snps are distributed across  <dig>  genes.  <dig> % of the novel deleterious snps and 28% of the known deleterious snps are homozygous, of the known  <dig>  deleterious snps,  <dig> are common with the lof data set. there is no enrichment of disease classes, but analysis using david tool showed an enrichment of olfactory receptor activity with benjamin corrected p-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  a similar enrichment in olfactory receptor activity was observed in analysis of whole genome sequence of indian individual  <cit> .

associating identified variants with phenotype traits
a major challenge in delineating functional aspects from personal genomes lies in relating the variants with biological phenotypes such as pharmacogenomic traits, disease risks and other common phenotypic traits . of the identified homozygous lof variants, rs <dig>  . the participant is a carrier of homozygous genotypes at three of the following deleterious snps; rs <dig>   , rs <dig>   , rs <dig>    at rs <dig> provides protection from type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . as regards to the homozygous genotype of gg seen at rs <dig> in the sequenced genome, it has been reported that twenty-four hours after a word list-learning task, carriers of either the  or  genotypes recalled 17% more information than  genotype carriers, but short-term memory was unaffected  <cit> . rs <dig> has been associated with triglyceride  response to fenofibrate treatment for hypertriglyceridemia  <cit> ; participants having the homozygous aa genotype  at rs <dig> have greater triglyceride lowering ability than those with the cc genotype in response to fenofibrate treatment. though risk alleles are seen at these variants, the manifestation is not seen in the participant. for example, participant medication history does not state use of fenofibrate and his triglyceride levels are reported to be normal at  <dig>  mmol/l. in future, if these phenotypes manifests in the participant, these findings can aid physicians in treating the participant.table  <dig>

only in the case of these  <dig> , the genotype-phenotype associations are known in nhgri gwas catalog.



the remaining deleterious snps that are heterozygous, include rs <dig>    that is associated with warfarin drug response and altered vitamin k  metabolism. it has been shown that compared to individuals with the homozygous cyp4f <dig> genotype  at rs <dig>  carriers of the heterozygous ct  genotypes require higher warfarin doses to elicit anticoagulation response  <cit> . an earlier study in kuwait has also reported poor quality of anticoagulation with warfarin  <cit> . other phenotypes such as multiple sclerosis and obesity are also seen in this list of deleterious snps .

from the remaining known non-coding snps, we annotated  <dig>  snps corresponding to  <dig> traits .  <dig>   of these  <dig>  snps are homozygous. in congruence with the reported history of type  <dig> diabetes and β-thalassemia  by the participant, we find the presented genome to exhibit  <dig> out of  <dig> type  <dig> diabetes and  <dig> out of  <dig> β-thalassemia variants as annotated in nhgri gwas catalog. we find that most of the observed  <dig> type  <dig> diabetes snps have been discovered in populations of south and east asian descent  <cit>  , and  <dig> in east asian populations). as single locus has a very modest effect on type  <dig> diabetes susceptibility and all the reported loci seem to partly account for the heritability of type  <dig> diabetes, it is difficult to say whether one or few or all of these  <dig> snps influence the phenotype in the individual . the three β-thalassemia variants observed in the sequenced genome are: rs <dig>    <cit> , rs <dig>    <cit> , and rs <dig>    <cit> . it has been reported that these three loci are the best and common predictors of the disease severity in β-thalassemia  <cit> . further, it is noted that there is incidence of migraine in the family of the participant; in conformity with this, we find the presented genome to exhibit  <dig> out of  <dig> migraine variants annotated in gwas catalog.

comparing the sequenced genome with individual genomes from other continents
in order to assess the extent of variability that the kwp <dig> genome exhibits, we performed inter-genome comparisons with  <dig> representative genomes from four continents and derived nearest-neighbor tree based on genome-wide variant positions shared among genomes . kwp <dig> genome is seen located in the vicinity of the five ceu genomes . on rebuilding the tree using only those shared snps, which are previously associated with human diseases cataloged in omim database, we observe a change in the position of kwp <dig> genome, now lying between the asian and the european genomes  – this is in concordance with geographical location of the origin of sample i.e. at the nexus of asian and european continents. this illustrates that disease profile of individual populations can be different, irrespective of their overall shared origin and that ethnicity acts as the dominant trend structuring disease-associated snp locations.figure  <dig>

annotation of the genome for structural variations
we identified  <dig>  structural variations consisting of  <dig>  deletions,  <dig>  duplications,  <dig> insertions,  <dig> inversions and  <dig>  translocations. of the total  <dig>  variations, as many as  <dig>   are overlapping with known structural variations in dgv   <cit> . furthermore, we see that  <dig>  of the reported structural variations lie in previously annotated human repeat-rich regions containing sine , line and ltr repeat elements .table  <dig>

concordance in snp calls between the deep sequencing experiment and genotyping experiment using bead chip arrays
we observed an overall concordance of > <dig> % for homozygous and heterozygous snps  between sequencing and bead chip data;  <dig> of  <dig>  heterozygous snps and  <dig> of  <dig>  homozygous snps were seen wrongly called between two data sets. in  <dig> instances of the  <dig> mismatch heterozygous snps, they were called heterozygous in both data sets, but their alleles do not match., of these  <dig> snps,  <dig> are annotated as multiallelic markers in dbsnp  <dig> and variant calls made using sequencing data are subsets of annotated alleles in dbsnp  <dig>  of the remaining  <dig> mismatch heterozygous snps,  <dig> lie in known copy number variation regions as annotated in dgv and  <dig> lie in known regions of genomic duplications as annotated in genomic super dups database  <cit> . on examining the remaining  <dig> mismatch heterozygous snps, the read depth in these regions ranges from 2– <dig> with a mean depth of  <dig> . we looked at a snp rs <dig>  having a read depth of  <dig> with  <dig> reads supporting g allele and  <dig> reads supporting a allele, that is called as gg in sequencing data  but as heterozygous ag in bead chip ; this instance of sequencing call clearly indicates that genotype calls using sequencing data can go wrong in regions of low coverage.figure  <dig>

further, we examined the impact of novel snps and indels in the vicinity of snps typed on bead chip. we consider an exemplary snp of rs <dig>  which has a novel heterozygous deletion of 2 bps upstream of the variant in kgp <dig> genome, that is supposed to have ct call ; however, the typed marker in bead chip leads to inconsistent genotype call of cc . further, we illustrate that there exist a considerable number of novel snps and indels in kwp <dig> genome around the typed common markers  which can lead to inconsistent calls.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study, as part of kuwait genome project , analyzes genome of a kuwaiti male participant with origin tracing back to persian tribes of iran. this separate genetic subgroup of persian ancestry has also been reported in other states of arabian peninsula, such as qatar  <cit> . we report around ~ <dig>  million genome variants, some of which are novel.

presence of persians in kuwait dates back to seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but due to absence of borders until the middle of twentieth century, there are no historical records available  <cit> . myron push-pull theory  <cit>  has often been used to explain persian migration from southwest iran to kuwait. during the period of late nineteenth century to the early twentieth century, southwest iran was experiencing economic and political difficulties. these difficulties acted as push factors for persian migration to places such as dubai, sharjah, abu dhabi, al-doha, basrah and manamah. in contrast, the pull factors typified by the political stability, economic prosperity, low taxes and low crime rate attracted persians to state of kuwait  <cit> . presence of the genetic subgroup of persian ancestry in other states of the arabian peninsula  may suggest that migrations among gulf states might also have happened; nautical trade along the arabian gulf might have facilitated such intra-peninsula migrations. in modern-day kuwait, up to  <dig> – 30% of the natives are of persian descent  <cit> .

large-scale sequencing initiatives are being proposed  <cit>   in the peninsula with the aim to provide comprehensive data on genome variants instrumental in designing genome-wide bead arrays for conducting large-scale genetic studies in populations of the region. bead arrays are designed with two assumptions:  the sequence in the sample is identical to the probe sequence, except at the position to be genotyped, and  there are only two possible alleles at the genotyped position for which the array is designed  <cit> . we find examples to show that falsifying any of the above two conditions can lead to wrong genotype calls from bead arrays. previous reports on utilization of genome-wide bead arrays designed using reference human genome show that up to 34 % of published array-based gwas studies for a variety of diseases utilize probes that overlap unanticipated snps, indels, or structural variants  <cit> .

as sequencing experiments are gaining pace and large studies are being designed to decipher genetic relationships with common biological traits, unequal distribution of reads across genome regions can become a cause of concern. previous reports have shown that differences in read depths across regions of genome and homozygous snp calls flatten when the read depth reaches a threshold of  <dig>  but heterozygous calls increase with increase in read depth  <cit> . in this paper, we show that a region of low read depth can cause false homozygous call using sequencing data, but correct heterozygous call was made using bead array. in a vicious circle of technology improvement, more large-scale sequencing studies on individual populations are needed to design more robust bead arrays, however these large sequencing projects can utilize the current bead arrays to improve genotype calling in low coverage regions.

we demonstrate that the genome of the sequenced individual, who suffers from type  <dig> diabetes, harbors as many as  <dig>  variants previously associated with type  <dig> diabetes. this observation has implications on global initiatives that strive to develop genome panels to help in genetic susceptibility testing for type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . several commercial companies offer genome panels incorporating up to  <dig> variants designed for different ethnicities  <cit> . clinical utility evidence provided by such panels that include differing number of variants up to  <dig> has been found to be inadequate. in our current study, we find that up to  <dig> markers relating to type  <dig> diabetes are seen in the sequenced genome.

we further demonstrate that the presented genome, of the individual who has a medical history of β-thalassemia , harbors three of the four β-thalassemia variants annotated in gwas catalog. thalassemia and sickle cell anemia are the most prevalent genetic blood diseases in kuwait  <cit> . furthermore, it is known that β-thalassemia is the most common hereditary disease in iran  <cit> ; the origin of the individual sequenced in this study traces back to the fars province of iran.

it is further assessed that the family of the individual sequenced in this study has a history of migraine. in concordance with this medical history, we find that the genome of the individual harbors  <dig>  variants that are associated with migraine in gwas catalog.

the identified variants include deleterious and loss-of-function coding variants, as well as critical non-coding variants that are associated with phenotype traits – some of the notable phenotype traits include: decrease in birth weight, protection towards type  <dig> diabetes, decrease in long term memory, greater triglyceride lowering ability in response to fenofibrate treatment, and higher warfarin doses to elicit anticoagulation response.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study to report a reference genome resource for the population of persian ancestry. we report novel genome variants that include snps, indels and structural variations that enlarge the current repertoire of human genome variation. nearest-neighbor tree built using shared disease-causing variants between the persian genome and other continental genome positions the persian genome between the asian and european genomes; this is in concordance with the geographical location of the origin of the sample at the nexus of asian and european continent. apart from the findings from population-context, the study illustrates that the participant’s medical history of type  <dig> diabetes and β-thalassemia as well as the medical history of migraine in the family of the participant, are accounted by the presence of a large number of genome variants that are known to be associated with these traits. the presented genome data provides a starting point for designing large-scale genetic studies in persian population.
