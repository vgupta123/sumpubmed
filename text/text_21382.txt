BACKGROUND
the human gut microorganisms form a specialized community, the human gut microbiome, that plays an important role in normal functioning of digestive metabolism, in nutrition and, possibly, in the development of the human immune system  <cit> . as part of their adaptation to the gut environment, the bacterial species forming the microbiome have developed an extensive ability to metabolize a wide variety of polysaccharides. this allows humans to utilize a broad range of plant- and host-secreted glycans that would otherwise be indigestible. bacteroides spp. are an essential part of the human gut microbiome and provide us with a broad range of metabolic enzymes  <cit> . the gram-negative bacterium bacteroides thetaiotaomicron is a dominant member of the normal human distal intestine and colon microbiota and has a large repertoire of genes for harvesting nutrients from a wide range of polysaccharides derived from both plants as well as hosts  <cit> .

bt_ <dig> from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> is a protein of unknown function and a member of a large family of uncharacterized proteins. the sequence analysis predicted that the bt_ <dig> protein is related to glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  based on the carbohydrate-active enzymes  classification  <cit> . a classification of glycoside hydrolases into families based on amino acid sequence similarity has been in place for a few decades  <cit> . however, structure analysis and comparisons allow us to confirm and fine tune function predictions based on sequence analysis.

a search against pfam database  <cit>  predicts that this protein has two domains: the n-terminal domain belongs to the pf <dig>  family and the c-terminal domain, which is a member of the pf <dig> family, currently annotated as a collagen-binding domain. many protein families annotated as dufs represent divergent branches of already known and well-characterized families, and the duf <dig> is no exception. it belongs to the pfam clan cl <dig>  the tim barrel glycosyl hydrolase superfamily. this allows us to hypothesize that it also may be a carbohydrate hydrolase.

the pfam database currently contains over  <dig>  families annotated only as “domains of unknown function”  <cit> . such families, because of the acronym of their name as known as dufs and are differentiated by their number, such as duf <dig>  in a coordinated effort the four large-scale centers of the nih protein structure initiative have determined the first three-dimensional structures for representatives of more than  <dig> of such families, and the first  <dig> were analyzed by our group previously  <cit> . in this paper we analyze the crystal structure of the bt_ <dig> protein and combine several bioinformatics approaches to suggest the function of this protein. the structure the bt_ <dig> protein was solved by jcsg and deposited in the pdb database as  in  <dig> 

RESULTS
structural determination
the crystal structure of the bt_ <dig>  protein from bacteroides thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> was determined to  <dig>  Å by mad  phasing. data-collection, model, phasing, and refinement statistics are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the final model includes four molecules , sixteen sulfate ions, two -2-methyl- <dig> -pentanediol , eight -2-methylpentane- <dig> -diol , and  <dig> water molecules in the asymmetric unit. modeling of the electron density for 2-methylpentanve- <dig> -diol was subjective because of the  <dig>  Å resolution limit, and further analysis showed that either the r or s enantiomer of 2-methylpentane- <dig> -diol could be modeled and refined. the structure is composed of twelve alpha-helices, five 310-helices, twenty beta strands. gly  <dig> , the region from ala 22-thr  <dig> on subunits a, c, and d; and ala 22-gln  <dig> on subunit b were disordered and not modeled. subunit d was partly disordered in the asymmetric unit and its statistics are slightly different from that of subunits a-c. the matthews coefficient  is  <dig>  Å3da- <dig> and the estimated solvent content is  <dig> %. the ramachandran plot produced by molprobity  <cit>  shows that  <dig> % with seven outliers.

the crystal structure of bt_ <dig> consists of two domains: the n-terminal 8−barrel  domain comprising residues  <dig> to  <dig> and the c-terminal greek-key β-sandwich domain covering residues  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. fastscop classification database search results confirms the tim beta/alpha barrel fold classification of n-terminal domain shows and further identifies it as a member of the beta-glycanases scop superfamily, supporting the notion that it has a function in carbohydrate metabolism. the structure of the c-terminal domain is similar to the c-terminal domain of a human alpha-galactosidase , indicating that it might be involved in carbohydrate binding . families describing both domains of this protein are strongly overrepresented in human gut metagenomic datasets. for instance, pf <dig> family has  <dig> and pf <dig> has  <dig> homologs in the uniprot uniprotkb database  <cit> , while the metahit  dataset  <cit>  has  <dig> and  <dig> homologs respectively, despite being four times smaller than uniprot uniprotkb  it is very unlikely for bt_ <dig> to be involved in collagen binding, as suggested by some database annotations. detailed analysis for each domain follows.

n-terminal domain
the n–terminal domain of of the bt_ <dig> protein is the first experimentally determined structure of a representative of pfam family pf <dig>  this family belongs to a large superfamily containing a range of glycoside hydrolase enzymes with a tim barrel fold . this pfam clan includes members of the following cazy clans: gh-a, gh-d, gh-h and gh-k. a sequence similarity search by psi-blast and ffas against pdb found that the most similar proteins were endo-beta- <dig> -mannanases from the gh <dig> family: 3ziz, 4awe and 1qno . the most similar structures identified by dali and fatcat  are also endo-beta-mannanase enzymes, but from the gh <dig> family . although the pf <dig> family is predominantly prokaryotic, most of the structures identified in the dali and fatcat search belong to eukaryotes, mostly fungi and plants, reflecting lack of structural studies of proteins from this clan in bacteria. structural alignment of the pf <dig> domain with endo-beta-mannanase  reveals that the putative active site has asp <dig> as the catalytic nucleophile/base residue of the active site and glu <dig> as the catalytic proton donor position instead of the highly conserved glu - glu pair found in the gh-a superfamily and in particular in gh <dig> . however, the loops that form the presumed active site are quite a bit longer than those found in many mannanase enzymes , suggesting significant differences in binding specificity. in the cup-shaped region of the putative active site, we found highly conserved trp <dig>  trp <dig> and tyr <dig> residues which are very likely involved in carbohydrate binding . the role of aromatic amino acids in carbohydrate binding was established decades ago  <cit> . the aromatic residues  form the hydrophobic platforms in the binding sites, which adopt different shapes in order to interact with a variety of carbohydrates  <cit> .

sequence conservation analysis was performed to identify residues that may be functionally important. we found that the potential active site of this domain is more divergent than in any of the subfamilies of the gh <dig> family. the gh <dig> family has about 98% conservation of catalytic residues of the active site  while proteins in the pf <dig> family has asp at the catalytic site in 82% of cases, glu in  <dig> % and asn in the remaining  <dig> %. to understand the possible functional role of other conserved residues, we show them on the surface of the protein model . most of the conserved residues formed a cleft on one side of the protein near the active site, while the opposite side has just a few conserved exposed residues. the cleft has conserved aromatic residues: tyr <dig> and tyr <dig> . this supports the hypothesis that this domain may have a carbohydrate binding function.

a phylogenetic tree based on all members of the pf <dig> family shows that the members that have glu in the catalytic site do not form a single branch in the tree . because of a low sequence similarity to other glycoside hydrolases, we built trees based on dali structural alignments  <cit>  and using posa   <cit>  . briefly, posa calculates a distance matrix using the p-value of the similarity of two structures from fatcat structural alignment algorithm with the rigid alignment option and then performs a single linkage clustering on the distance matrix to generate the tree  <cit> . both trees support classification of pf <dig> family with the gh <dig> family. we also performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the alignments obtained by ffas   <cit> . this analysis supports the hypothesis that pf <dig> and the gh <dig> family might have the same ancestor . however, the gh <dig> family has a strongly conserved active site, which is not the case for the pf <dig> family. taken together, we therefore surmise that the pf <dig> family is not a part of the gh <dig> family but is a first representative of a novel, albeit sharing a common ancestor with gh <dig> family, glycoside hydrolase family, and we have renamed the pfam domain as a putative glycoside hydrolase. this new family would expand an already impressive catalog of  <dig> carbohydrate-hydrolytic enzymes, which mostly represent gt <dig> , gh <dig>  and gh <dig>  families.

c-terminal domain
the c–terminal domain of the bt_ <dig> protein, corresponding to the pfam pf <dig> domain family, was previously annotated in pfam as a collagen-binding domain. this domain has a beta-sandwich fold . according to pfam, this domain is found almost exclusively at the c–termini of proteins with the pf <dig> domain. the structural comparison by dali and fatcat found that this domain to be similar to c-terminal domains of different hydrolases with a broad spectrum of substrate specificity . based on cazy classification, the top hits of fatcat and dali searches are proteins bearing catalytic domains belonging to gh <dig> , gh <dig> , and gh <dig>   glycosyl hydrolase families. the top ten dali and fatcat hits are different from those found in the n-terminal domain search  and these proteins do not have similar domain combinations. it is interesting that several proteins with overall structural similarity to 3kzs  belong to cellulases of subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig> of the gh <dig> family . the gh <dig> family has different carbohydrate-binding modules , however some of them  have beta-sandwich folds  <cit> . according to the cazy database,  <dig> of the  <dig> b. thetaiotaomicron vpi- <dig> enzymes possess cbm domains. of these, the majority  belong to the cbm <dig> family, which also has a beta-sandwich fold.

a putative role for the c-terminal domain as a cbm would be strengthened by any observation of conserved, solvent-exposed aromatic residues  <cit>  but none were apparent. nevertheless, there is a conserved surface patch composed of asn <dig>  aln <dig>  arg <dig>  and asn <dig>  which could have a substrate binding function . no conserved aromatic residues are present on the surface. moreover, the c-terminal domain of the bt_ <dig> protein is on the opposite side of the putative active site and interacts strongly with the tim barrel domain, which provides tyr <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig> and pro <dig> to this interaction. at the same time, most of the domains identified in the structural similarity search with the c-terminal domain of the bt_ <dig> protein do not bind carbohydrates, despite being part of glycolytic enzymes. instead they have auxiliary function; for example stabilization of catalytic domains or involvement in domain-domain interaction . to sum up, this domain more is likely to stabilize the n-terminal domain than be directly involved in substrate binding.

the whole structure 3kzs and functional prediction for each domain
the structure similarity searches using dali and fatcat with the whole bt_ <dig> structure still identified single domain proteins as the top hits. thus we separately analyzed top multi-domain proteins found in these searched . with this constraint, the top match is the beta-galactosidase from bacillus circulans sp. alkalophilus . this enzyme has three domains and an atypical active site  <cit> . according to the authors, the function of the third domain, which has a beta-sandwich fold, is purely structural because they did not find clefts on the surface or cavities that could have carbohydrate binding function.

the distant homology recognition for the bt_ <dig> protein by ffas found that the top ten hits belong to the gh <dig> family. all other gh <dig> hits have a single  domain with only one exception - arabinoxylan-specific xylanase from clostridium thermocellum atcc  <dig>  has an additional domain that belongs to the cbm <dig> family. this module was shown to increase thermostability of the catalytic domain and was involved in binding of cellohexaose or xylohexaose  <cit> . another example of a glycoside hydrolase with an additional c-terminal domain that is a distant homolog of 3kzs is β-xylosidase ii from caulobacter crescentus cb <dig> . this protein belongs to the gh <dig> family and has a c terminal domain that regulates the accessibility and molecular topography of the active site  <cit> . thus, there are several examples that support our hypothesis that the c-terminal domain has a supportive and regulatory function. this domain is always found in two domain proteins following the pf <dig> domain, and about 60% of the pf <dig> family members have the c-terminal domain .

many carbohydrate-related proteins in bacteriodes are grouped into polysaccharide utilization loci, often of well-defined induction specificity. however, the bt_ <dig> coding gene is not a part of any of these loci. genomic-context analysis using the microbesonline database  <cit>  and string revealed that bt_ <dig> is colocalized with alpha-rhamnosidase, and rhamnosidases  are linked by genome neighborhoods in other species too. rhamnose is commonly bound to other sugars, but is also a common component of plant glycosides  <cit> . this suggests that bt_ <dig> may be a partner of alpha-rhamnosidase in plant sugar degradation. taken together that the catalytic domain has longer loops compared to mannanases , this may suggest that it can make additional interactions with long polysaccharide substrates.

phylogenetic analysis did not find any correlation with the presence of the c-terminal domain and having glu/asp in the catalytic site. however, we found that glu/asp members form three different branches . the c-terminal domain may change the conformation of the central catalytic domain and provide the enzyme with a broad spectrum of substrate specificity. the structure similarity tree built by posa  shows that 3kzs has groups closely with gh <dig> family. in dbcan  <cit> , the bt_ <dig> was identified as a subfamily  <dig> of the gh <dig> family. however, this database was developed to provide a capability for automated cazyme signature domain-based annotation for any given protein data set  <cit> , thus we can question this annotation. moreover, the tree built based on dali alignment shows that 3kzs is close to gh <dig> and gh <dig> families and distant from gh <dig> family . taking into account that gh <dig> is mostly represented by enzymes having a single catalytic domain, with strong conservation of glu at the active sites and distant sequence similarity of pf <dig> and particular 3kzs, we conclude that bt_ <dig> is the a novel two-domain glycoside hydrolase with a catalytic domain and a c-terminal auxiliary domain.

CONCLUSIONS
the crystal structure of the bt_ <dig> protein and structure-based sequence-structure-function analysis suggests that bt_ <dig> and its approximately  <dig> full length homologs, ranging in sequence identity from 40-60%, are two domain glycoside hydrolases, which include an n-terminal catalytic domain and a c-terminal auxiliary domain which may be involved in stabilizing or regulating the catalytic domain. based on our findings, we have renamed the pf <dig> family as “putative glycoside hydrolase” and the pf <dig> family as “glycoside hydrolase-associated c-terminal domain”.
