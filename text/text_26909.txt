BACKGROUND
transcription is the first committed step of gene expression in prokaryotes, and as such is highly regulated. promoter sequences direct the transcription of both coding and non-coding rnas by acting as target sites for specific rna polymerase binding and activity  <cit> . bacteria employ an ingenious machinery to adapt effectively and economically to conditions of stress or environmental changes. the initial mechanism of transcription regulation is based on recruitment of certain sigma  factors by rna polymerase core enzyme . complex formation with σ factors is essential for rnap binding to a particular promoter sequence and thus for transcription initiation  <cit> .

 genome-wide identification of promoter sequences facilitates identification of dna-binding sites for regulatory proteins and also provides insights into the organization of transcriptional units. rnaseq approaches have allowed the large-scale identification of transcription start sites  in the ε-proteobacterium helicobacter pylori and the cyanobacteria synechocystis sp., synechococcus elongatus, and anabaena sp., facilitating the characterization of promoter sequence motifs upstream of the tss. these approaches revealed an unexpected abundance of cis-encoded antisense rnas  and trans-encoded srnas , and thereby illuminated a previously unknown dimension of prokaryotic transcriptional activity  <cit> . this picture is consistent with rnaseq studies in diverse gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria  <cit> .

 the α-class of the proteobacteria comprises diverse bacteria with complex lifestyles, including obligate and facultative plant- and animal-associated bacteria , phototrophs, chemoorganotrophs, and chemolithotrophs  <cit> . in addition, eukaryotic mitochondria are proposed to have arisen from an ancient α-proteobacterium  <cit> . despite their importance, little is known about α-proteobacterial transcriptome organization. this study presents the first comprehensive mapping of tss and assignment of identified promoter sequences to σ factors in an α-proteobacterium. sinorhizobium meliloti exists either in a free-living life-style in the soil or in symbiosis with a leguminous plant host. in the symbiotic relationship, the bacteria inhabit root nodules, differentiate into polyploid bacteroids, and fix nitrogen to the benefit of the host  <cit> . functions for these distinct lifestyles are encoded in the tripartite s. meliloti genome: a single chromosome  and two megaplasmids, psyma  and psymb   <cit> .

 to adapt to environmental changes or stress situations, s. meliloti can draw on a set of  <dig> σ factors  <cit> . rpod  provides for housekeeping functions, while alternative σ factors are usually involved in adaptation to specific stresses or growth conditions  <cit> . rpon  is essential for transcription of nitrogen fixation-related genes  <cit> . two rpoh σ factors, with sequence similarity to the escherichia coli heat shock σ <dig>  were identified in s. meliloti <cit> ; rpoh <dig>  was found to be largely responsible for adaptation to heat shock, oxidative stress, and ph changes, whereas the role of rpoh <dig>  is largely unknown  <cit> . at least  <dig> σ factor genes  are annotated in the s. meliloti genome as encoding extracytoplasmic function  σ factors, which are usually regulated by anti-σ factors. the ecf σ factor, rpoe <dig> , was characterized as the regulator of at least  <dig> genes, including rpoh <dig> and rpoe <dig>  and was inferred to be a global regulator of general stress adaptation and the hyperosmotic stress response  <cit> .

 the rnaseq approach reported in this study obtained  <dig>  experimentally mapped tss, including both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. we were able to predict  <dig>  σ factor-specific promoter sequences in appropriate distance to a tss. this newly defined landscape of tss and promoter motifs increases our knowledge of promoter properties and will facilitate further analyses of transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation processes in s. meliloti.

RESULTS
global mapping of transcription start sites
to comprehensively map tss of the s. meliloti  <dig> transcriptome, rna populations derived from  <dig> different growth and stress conditions were pooled and used for cdna library preparation . these conditions included exponential and stationary phase growth in three different media, temperature and ph shifts, oxidative and high salt stress, microoxia, carbon or nitrogen starvation, and exposure to the plant-secreted flavonoid, luteolin. this flavonoid induces expression of bacterial nodulation genes, which are required for the establishment of symbiosis  <cit> . s. meliloti  <dig> carries a mutation in expr encoding a global luxr-type transcriptional regulator engaged in quorum sensing. this regulator affects multiple processes including exopolysaccharide biosynthesis and motility  <cit> . in order to map expr-dependent transcripts, which would otherwise be lacking, rna from an expr+ derivative of s. meliloti  <dig> was also included in our pool. enzymatic treatment of rna samples with terminator 5′-phosphate-dependent exonuclease resulted in enrichment of transcripts with primary 5′ ends, prior to cdna synthesis and deep sequencing .

 our procedure for mapping and classifying tss is diagrammed in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and described in detail in methods. briefly,  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained, of which  <dig> , <dig> passed all filtering criteria, and subsequently were subjected to tss determination and classification. tss assigned to trnas, repeats, and transposons are listed separately .

overall,  <dig>  tss, not including those listed in table s <dig>  were grouped into six categories based on their genomic context with respect to a minimal transcription unit  model . tss representing the prominent 5′ end of a sequence contig overlapping in sense orientation a region of  <dig> nt upstream of the start codon of protein-coding genes were classified as  tss of mrnas .  <dig> nt were defined as the minimal region upstream of the atg to cover promoter motifs and the ribosome binding site, which are more likely to be associated with an mrna than to a trans-encoded srna.  tss were assigned to leaderless transcripts , if matching the first nucleotide of the translation initiation codon. the class of  putative tss of mrnas  comprises tss that are difficult to distinguish: for any given pmtss, it is uncertain if the tss represents an mrna of a protein-coding gene possessing a long 5′-utr or a tss of a trans-encoded srna.  sense tss  represent internal transcripts in the same orientation as, and located within, protein-coding genes.  tss of cis-encoded antisense rnas  are orientated in antisense to protein-coding target genes, and  tss of trans-encoded srnas  are located in intergenic regions  and within a defined distance from neighboring genes. figures 1b and 1c give an overview of the location and number of tss in each category, which are discussed in more detail below.

tss categories
mtss 
a total of  <dig>  mtss were assigned to  <dig>  protein-coding genes . the total number of s. meliloti annotated protein- coding genes is  <dig>  <cit> , and  <dig> operons were predicted  <cit> . assuming a rough estimate of three co-transcribed genes per operon, we have identified tss for most protein-coding genes in the s. meliloti genome. about 60%  appear to contain a single tss, while the remaining genes contain multiple tss. at least  <dig> putative tss were identified for each of the genes smc <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> . the most frequent initiating nucleotide for mtss transcripts was a , followed by g , t , and c  . this agrees with observations that purine nucleotides are the most common initiating nucleotide in bacteria  <cit> , a preference that may be explained by the relatively larger pool size of purine vs. pyrimidine nucleotides  <cit> .

the existence of alternative promoters for a single gene is one explanation that could account for multiple tss, as exemplified by psts, which encodes a phosphate-binding periplasmic protein, and was previously shown to have two tss located downstream from two phob binding motifs  corresponding to tss s <dig> and s <dig> of figure 1d  <cit> . similarly, ctra, which encodes a global cell cycle regulator, showed two strongly accumulating transcripts corresponding to tss s <dig> and s <dig>  that were previously identified downstream from conserved promoter motifs   <cit> . alternatively, post-transcriptional processing of the 5′-utr of mrnas may account for multiple mtss located downstream of tss associated with conserved promoter motifs, as is plausible for six tss of psts  and four tss of ctra .

the average mtss-to-start-codon distance was ~  <dig> nt , somewhat longer than previously reported for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium <cit>  and h. pylori <cit> . moreover, the average distance increases to ~ <dig> nt if pmtss lengths  are included in the calculation. in 40% of all cases, the distance between the mtss and start codon is between  <dig> and  <dig> nt. the maximum distance was  <dig> nt for the mrna leader transcript of smc <dig> . 5′-utrs longer than  <dig> nt were found preceding  <dig>  genes . this indicates that long 5′-utrs are not unusual in s. meliloti and may even signify complex mechanisms of gene regulation, as is likely the case for ctra .

 to identify new protein-coding genes that were missed in previous genome annotations  <cit> , we followed the procedure described in methods and outlined in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  this included screening for translational signals, such as ribosome binding sites  and translational start and stop codons. this approach yielded  <dig> tss, associated with  <dig> new and  <dig> alternative translational units . to increase the probability of annotating only genuine open reading frames , we searched the ncbi nonredundant protein database for orthologs of these newly identified genes. genes that had orthologs in other α-proteobacteria were named according to the scheme, smx_orf_x, and added to the gendb s. meliloti genome database  <cit> .

lmtss 
 <dig> tss of leaderless transcripts mapped to the first nucleotide of the corresponding start codon . only a single tss was found for  <dig> of these lmtss, with the remainder found in combination with mtss , pmtss , or both  . leaderless transcripts were also observed in synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  e. coli, rhodobacter sphaeroides, and pseudomonas putida <cit> . all lmtss initiate with an aug triplet, consistent with results in e. coli showing that the 5′-terminal aug of leaderless mrnas is important for ribosome recognition and interaction  <cit> , and that non-aug start codons are inefficient  <cit> . also, a recent study proposed a mechanism for leaderless mrna translation in e. coli <cit> . in this mechanism, the mazef stress-induced toxin-antitoxin system, in particular the endoribonuclease mazf, plays an important role in maturation of both leaderless mrnas and a novel, processed 16s rrna. assembly of the ribosome with this novel rrna molecule results in an alternative translational machinery, which is able to translate two classes of leaderless transcripts: those processed via mazf and naturally occurring leaderless mrnas  <cit> . in s. meliloti, our observation that most genes with leaderless transcripts possess a single tss , suggests that naturally occurring leaderless mrnas are preferred over processed leaderless transcripts. it is possible that the  <dig> leaderless mrnas for which an alternative tss was identified were processed via endoribonucleases similar to mazf in e. coli, but such a mechanism has not yet been described in s. meliloti.

organization of protein-coding genes into operons is a common feature in bacterial genomes. recently, we reported  <dig> experimentally validated operons and  <dig>  predicted operons in the s. meliloti  <dig> genome  <cit> . tss for  <dig> of those experimentally validated operons and  <dig> of the predicted operons were identified in our rnaseq data .

pmtss 
a special situation is illustrated by  <dig> pmtss, of which  <dig> represent the only tss identified for the corresponding gene . in many cases, it is unclear if these pmtss represent mrnas with unusually long 5′-utrs or non-coding transcripts. one such example is illustrated by smc <dig>  which possesses two pmtss . on the other hand, the most distal tss of ctra  almost certainly represents a transcript with a long 5′-utr , because ctra was shown to bind upstream of this tss  <cit> . ctra also binds to four additional sites downstream of the s <dig> tss suggesting a complex mechanism of autoregulation .

setss 
sense tss must meet two criteria: they must be located in the same orientation as a protein-coding gene and within the corresponding orf. sense transcripts are the largest group of tss in our study:  <dig>  were classified as belonging to sense transcripts; and therefore, approximately half of all identified tss correspond to internal fragments of mrna transcripts .

a high proportion of sense transcripts was also observed in rnaseq studies of other prokaryotes, e.g. synechocystis sp. pcc <dig> and anabaena sp. pcc <dig>  but the functional role of these rna fragments, if any, remains to be elucidated  <cit> . it is possible that sense transcripts may act as target mimicry molecules that sequester srnas, asrnas, or ribonucleases from their respective mrna target domains  <cit> . presumably, a small proportion of sense fragments may represent alternative mrnas that allow for synthesis of shorter protein isoforms in s. meliloti. however, a more likely explanation is that despite the procedure we used to enrich for transcripts with primary 5′ ends, the majority of sense fragments correspond to abundant processed derivatives of their respective mrnas rather than independent, primary mrnas transcribed from their own promoters  <cit> .

astss 
cis-encoded antisense rnas act as regulatory rna via perfect binding to their corresponding target mrnas encoded on the opposite dna strand. the first genome-wide rnaseq-based screen for non-coding transcripts in  s. meliloti identified  <dig> asrnas  <cit> . however, antisense rna detection was limited in that study, because the protocol was designed to preferentially detect short rnas. this study greatly increased the number of antisense transcripts with the identification of  <dig>  astss that were assigned to  <dig> asrnas associated with the noncoding strand of protein-coding genes . approximately 35% of the protein-coding genes in s. meliloti  had antisense transcripts . for  <dig>  target genes, a single astss was identified, while the remaining genes appear to contain two or more astss . an example of an antisense rna with three tss, smb_asrna_ <dig>  is shown in figure 1e. occurrence of numerous antisense transcripts associated with a single protein-coding gene most likely represents processed products of a single, primary non-coding asrna, rather than transcripts of independent asrna genes. examples are smb <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> with  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> astss, respectively . the three replicons, chromosome, psyma, and psymb represent  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of the total genome size in bp. taking into account the different replicon sizes, antisense transcripts were weakly overrepresented on psyma  and psymb  . the strand-specific location of antisense transcripts on psymb shows a slight preference for the minus strand, whereas it is virtually equal on the remaining replicons .

 the observed features for cis-encoded antisense srnas in s. meliloti are in good agreement with other bacterial transcriptomes. three studies detected antisense transcription of ~27% to ~50% of the annotated protein-coding genes in two cyanobacteria and h. pylori <cit> . it is tempting to speculate that antisense transcriptional activity is widespread in prokaryotic genomes. however, antisense transcriptional activity represented less than 5% of the protein-coding genes in chlamydia trachomatis, staphylococcus aureus, p. syringae, vibrio cholerae, and s. enterica <cit> . it is unknown whether this variation reflects differences in experimental and data analysis procedures or biological mechanisms.

 the total length of each transcript in our study is unknown due to the method we used for cdna library preparation. prokaryotic asrnas are generally short transcripts of approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nt  <cit> . this number is in good agreement to the size range  of 117 s. meliloti asrnas identified in schlüter et al.  <cit> . however, several asrnas of other bacterial species were as long as  <dig>  nt  <cit> .

depending on the location of an asrna relative to its target gene, various mechanisms have been proposed. in  s. meliloti,  <dig> predicted asrnas overlapped the 5′-utr of the associated mrna . these may function as described for symr in e. coli and rnag in shigella flexneri:cis-encoded asrnas, antisense to 5′-utr domains of their relative target genes, are able to modulate transcription, translation efficiency, and mrna stability  <cit> . in s. meliloti,  <dig> asrnas overlap the 3′-utr of their particular target genes  and therefore, might influence the target mrna stability in a similar fashion as described for the rata/txpa toxin-antitoxin system in b. subtilis. duplex formation by rata and txpa transcripts leads to txpa mrna degradation, and thus prevents toxin synthesis  <cit> . the largest group of cis-encoded asrnas in s. meliloti  comprises transcripts antisense to the protein-coding domain of their target mrna . several regulatory mechanisms have been postulated for this type of asrna. an example of targeted co-degradation of an mrna/asrna duplex is illustrated by isia/isrr of synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  <cit> . other regulatory mechanisms do not focus on the asrnas themselves, but on the strength of their respective promoters, rnap elongating rates, and rnap competition events. three mechanisms of transcriptional interference, promoter collision, promoter occlusion, and “sitting duck” interference , were proposed to explain the interfering effects of rnap complexes acting in opposite directions  <cit> .

stss 
 trans-encoded srnas are usually located in igrs, and in contrast to antisense transcripts, do not overlap their target genes. in total,  <dig> stss were associated with trans-encoded srnas . as described for smela <dig>  smela <dig>  and smela <dig> in s. meliloti, and gady in e. coli, processed variants of non-coding transcripts are not unusual in bacteria  <cit> . thus, we assigned closely neighboring tss to a single srna region. an example for newly identified sma_srna_ <dig> is shown in figure 1e. the majority of trans-encoded srnas  were assigned only a single tss, while  <dig> exhibited at least one alternative tss . therefore, our rnaseq approach identified  <dig> srnas located in  <dig> igrs . newly identifed srnas were named following the scheme smx_srna_x and added to the s. meliloti gendb database  <cit> .

 comparison of our rnaseq approach to that of schlüter et al.  <cit> , confirmed  <dig> mtss,  <dig> stss,  <dig> astss, and  <dig> setss . for further validation, we compiled an additional set of transcripts from the previous  <dig> rnaseq data  <cit> , but applied less stringent criteria . comparison of the additional set of transcripts to those of this study showed concordance for  <dig> . for transcripts identified in both data sets, locations of the 3′ ends were retrieved from the previous  <dig> rnaseq data and are provided in additional file 2: table s <dig>  examples of four such transcripts are shown in figure 2c.

 our rnaseq analysis revealed  <dig> srnas; therefore, the ratio of cds to trans-encoded srnas in the s. meliloti genome is  <dig>  . somewhat lower cds/trans-encoded srna ratios were observed in v. cholerae, anabaena sp. pcc <dig>  and synechocystis sp. pcc <dig>  with proportions of  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  respectively  <cit> . in s. meliloti, the majority of srna genes  are located as single srna loci in a single igr. however,  <dig> igrs harbor at least two or three and  <dig> igrs harbor at least four srna genes .

 although psyma represents only  <dig> % of the total genome size in bp,  <dig> % of the trans-encoded srnas identified in this study mapped to psyma, indicating an over-representation of srna genes on psyma and an under-representation on the chromosome  and psymb  . considering that many genes required for symbiosis are located on psyma  <cit> , it is tempting to speculate that trans-encoded srnas play an important role in post-transcriptional regulation of the symbiotic genes.

aside from the previously identified 6s rna , the signal recognition particle , and the tmrna   <cit> , assigning functions to srnas remains a complex challenge. this study extends our knowledge of srnas and 5′-utrs and consequently will facilitate prospective functional analyses of srna/5′-utr interactions.

comparison to published tss data
we compared 124 s. meliloti  <dig> tss, published over the past several decades, to our rnaseq tss . this set of previously published tss is biased toward rpoh-dependent genes because  <dig> of the  <dig> tss were reported in a single study  <cit> . of the  <dig> published tss, 60% matched an rnaseq tss exactly, 11% differed by only 1– <dig> nt, and 7% differed by ≥ <dig> nt. the remaining  <dig> previously reported tss were not identified in our rnaseq data. some of these may be explained by the different growth conditions tested in each study. for example, fixa and nifh are expressed primarily in symbiosis, a condition that was not included in our study for technical reasons. additionally, barnett et al.  <cit>  used different growth media than we did, which may explain why we failed to identify  <dig> rpoh-dependent tss. two genes, nodd <dig> and syra, previously reported to have low expression and extremely long 5′-utr  <cit> , were also absent in our rnaseq data. we identified a tss for ndva in our rnaseq data that was misclassified by our automated system as belonging to the 5′-utr of an asrna . other reported tss, such as those corresponding to hypm, rpon, and trkh, had matching reads in our rnaseq data, yet failed to meet the coverage cutoff. these examples illustrate the delicate balance between sensitivity and specificity in global studies; in our study, a cutoff of ≥ <dig> reads was chosen to provide the best balance between identification of true positives and background noise.

as previously discussed, a major strength of our study is the comprehensiveness of our data. depending on the location of the specific primer chosen, alternate tss may be missed by primer extension or 5′ race mapping. hence, in comparing our tss data to published reports, we identified  <dig> genes with multiple tss, where just one tss had been reported before . in sum, the tss identified in this study are in good agreement with previous reports.

promoter prediction
the ~ <dig>  tss identified with rnaseq are an excellent resource with which to increase our knowledge about promoter properties in s. meliloti. as described above, previous promoter mapping has focused on regions upstream of a limited number of protein-coding genes. in addition, bioinformatics-based predictions have disregarded promoter motifs not associated with, or in antisense orientation to, protein-coding genes  <cit> . however in this study, tss corresponding to ~ <dig>  asrnas or srnas allowed us to directly identify  <dig> promoter sequences upstream of these genes, in addition to  <dig>  promoters identified upstream of protein-coding  genes .

 the σ subunit of rnap confers promoter specificity through interaction with conserved sequences upstream of tss  <cit> . the s. meliloti genome encodes  <dig> σ factors:  <dig> of these belong to the σ <dig> family, and thus are predicted to recognize -35/-10-type promoters, while one  belongs to the σ <dig> family and recognizes -24/-12-type promoters. putative promoter consensuses have been identified corresponding to seven of the 15 s. meliloti σ factors , and for promoters recognized by both σh <dig> and σh <dig> .

 our promoter prediction procedure is illustrated in additional file 1: figure s <dig> and described in detail in methods. briefly, previously identified promoter sequences for σ <dig>  σh <dig>  σh <dig>  σh1/ <dig>  σ <dig>  and σe <dig> were used to calculate position-specific scoring matrices   <cit> , which were then used in a genome-wide search for promoter motifs. the resulting motifs were correlated with the locations of all mapped tss and deemed to be putative promoters if located in the appropriate position relative to the tss . for prediction of σe <dig> and σe <dig> promoters, we used a different approach. these two σ factors belong to the ecf class of σ factors, which are often autoregulatory on their own operons  <cit> . we had previously shown that expression of rpoe <dig> and rpoe <dig> is dramatically increased in s. meliloti  <dig>  compared to s. meliloti  <dig>  <cit>  due to a loss-of-function mutation in ecfr <dig>  encoding the putative rpoe <dig> anti-σ factor   <cit> . this suggested that rpoe <dig> autoregulates expression of its own operon and that of rpoe <dig>  examination of regions upstream of the tss for these two operons revealed identical motifs . this motif was used in global string searches to identify additional putative σe <dig> motifs upstream of tss . for rpoe <dig>  we also performed string searching, but with the promoter motif recently predicted in  <cit> , tgtcaca-n16-cgtc, which is located  <dig> nt upstream of the tss we identified for the smb20029-rpoe <dig> operon.

overall, we predicted  <dig>  promoter sequences upstream of tss . σ70-dependent promoters make up the largest group of motifs . similarity between the s. meliloti σ <dig> and σh promoter consensuses was previously noted  <cit> , thus as expected, we found significant overlap  between the σ <dig> and σh promoter sets . e. coli σ <dig> and σ <dig> promoter consensuses also share similar features  <cit> , demonstrating that such overlap is not limited to s. meliloti, and that any in silico promoter prediction must be validated experimentally. in  <dig>  the first genome-wide prediction of s. meliloti σ <dig> promoter motifs provided a set of  <dig> experimentally validated  or computationally predicted  promoter motifs  <cit> . we confirmed that  <dig> of their  <dig> promoter sequences matched our tss and σ <dig> promoter predictions. ten promoter sequences identified in their study were not associated with mtss in our study, but instead to tss of other categories.

rpoh-dependent promoter motifs   <cit>  were assigned to  <dig>  unique tss, of which  <dig> were also identified in searches with the σ <dig> promoter motif . we identified extensive overlap among σh <dig>  σh <dig>  and σh1/ <dig> promoter predictions . barnett et al.  <cit>  characterized the rpoh <dig> and rpoh <dig> regulons during heat shock and stationary phase growth: in addition to the experimental validation of  <dig> tss downstream of putative rpoh-dependent promoters , they predicted  <dig> putative promoters upstream of protein-coding genes  <cit> . our data set validated ~59%  of these predicted promoters and added  <dig> previously unknown rpoh promoter motifs upstream of mrna start sites . thirty-three σh promoter motifs are located upstream of rpoh-dependent genes, but were not previously identified by barnett et al.  <cit> . due to the similarity of rpoh and rpod promoter motifs, the remaining set of  <dig> predicted rpoh promoters likely includes many false positives. rpoh-dependent regulation of the small non-coding rnas smelc <dig> and smelc <dig> was proposed  <cit> , and indeed, our analysis identified σh <dig>  σh <dig>  and σh1/ <dig> binding motifs upstream of smelc <dig> and smelc <dig> .

rpon -type σ factors are unique in that they require an activator to initiate transcription  <cit> . these activators, known as enhancer-binding proteins , interact with σ <dig> and bind dna upstream of the rpon-target promoters  <cit> . the s. meliloti genome is predicted to encode seven ebp , but target genes have been identified for only the first three of these . we identified rpon-dependent promoter motifs  upstream of  <dig> tss . due to the lack of symbiotic samples in our rna pools, we did not identify tss upstream of the rpon-dependent genes nifa, nifb, nifh, glnii and sma <dig>  only four of our predicted promoters  were previously characterized as rpon-dependent or predicted by in silico methods  <cit> ; therefore, our data provide a useful resource for the identification of additional rpon-regulated genes and characterization of ebp.

for σe <dig>   <dig> promoters were predicted , of which  <dig> were previously found by sauviac et al.  <cit> . an additional  <dig> of these promoters were experimentally validated for rpoe2-dependence by microarray . furthermore, we identified  <dig> putative σe <dig> promoter motifs . in contrast, only two additional promoter motifs were predicted for σe <dig> . this was not unexpected, as the rpoe9-type σ factors of rhodobacter sphaeroides and bacillus licheniformis were proposed to activate only their own operons  <cit> .

using our large set of newly predicted promoter motifs, we recompiled each of the consensus sequences for σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σe <dig>  σh <dig>  σh <dig>  and σh1/ <dig>  as expected, the resulting motifs  were similar to the previously reported consensus sequences  <cit> . as described before, the σ <dig> − <dig> region is poorly conserved in s. meliloti <cit>  .

global identification of promoter motifs in s. meliloti was hitherto limited due to limited knowledge about tss of individual genes. combining the tss identified in this study with the previously identified srnas  <cit>  provided a rich resource for identification of promoters and their assignment to σ factors. in summary, we were able to identify promoter motifs preceding ~ <dig> %  of known protein-coding genes  <cit>  and  <dig> non-coding rna genes . we also identified  <dig> promoter motifs preceding  <dig> dna regions corresponding to sense transcripts . this finding supports the hypothesis that at least a small percentage of sense transcripts may represent intact transcripts, such as regulatory srnas or mrnas that are transcribed from promoters internal to the predicted orf  <cit> .

transcription factor binding sites
while the σ subunit of rnap is the primary means of conferring specific transcript initiation, it has long been known that various transcription factors interact with bacterial promoters to activate or repress transcription  <cit> . activator-dependent promoters are common among those recognized by σ <dig> and often possess defective promoter elements  <cit> . promoter searches using pssm may fail to detect promoters possessing atypical core elements; therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which activators and repressors act at promoters is essential for a complete view of any transcriptional landscape. unfortunately, such mechanisms, including specific transcription factor binding sites, are quite diverse and difficult to detect de novo on a global scale. however, tss data can be used to provide information on promoter structure where binding sites are predicted or known, and to guide discovery of transcription factor binding sites where some functional information exists.

additional file 4: table s <dig> correlates previously reported transcription factor binding sites  <cit>  with our tss data. the group of predicted phob binding sites illustrates how tss information can provide supporting empirical evidence for in silico binding site predictions. under phosphate  limitation, the phor histidine kinase phosphorylates its cognate response regulator, phob, which interacts with conserved motifs  upstream of genes involved in the pi starvation response. while a large regulon of genes involved in s. meliloti response to pi limitation has been identified, and several dozen phob boxes have been predicted  <cit> , tss have been determined for only three phob-dependent genes . in e. coli, the phob box overlaps and replaces the − <dig> σ <dig> recognition elements of phob-dependent promoters  <cit> . since the three s. meliloti phob-dependent genes with mapped tss appeared to have poor − <dig> σ <dig> recognition elements overlapping with phob motifs, we matched the locations of previously predicted phob boxes to our tss. of the  <dig> genes with predicted phob boxes and tss in this study,  <dig> overlapped the − <dig> motif ; and therefore, are strong candidates for phob binding sites . additional phob boxes are located farther upstream of tss; these may be targets for other types of regulation, for example, phob-mediated repression, as was proposed for smc <dig>  <cit> .

an example of how tss data may guide binding site discovery is illustrated by the example of ctra, a global cell cycle regulator. ctra is autoregulatory upon its own promoter, which contains five verified ctra binding sites   <cit> . in contrast to c. crescentus, where the ctra regulatory circuit is well characterized  <cit> , little is known about ctra targets in s. meliloti. we used pssm to locate additional putative ctra binding sites upstream of s. meliloti protein-coding genes and compared these to our tss data . we identified  <dig> putative binding motifs, representing  <dig> genes: ~70% of the motifs are located upstream of tss or overlap tss . we confirmed ctra motifs upstream of tss corresponding to s. meliloti cell cycle-related genes previously predicted to possess such motifs   <cit> , and identified ctra motifs upstream of rpod and ftse, previously shown to bind ctra in brucella abortus <cit> . other s. meliloti genes with ctra motifs that are plausibly cell cycle regulated or were shown to be direct ctra targets in c. crescentus include podj, mraz, metk, clpp <dig>  ftsk, flaa, flac, flad, mcpe, mcpy, and smc <dig> . our data also suggest potential regulatory mechanisms; for example, s. meliloti gcra, an ortholog of c. crescentus gcra encoding a master cell cycle regulator that activates ctra transcription  <cit> , is transcribed divergently from argd and possesses a strong ctra motif overlapping the gcra tss, but on the opposite strand. a weaker ctra motif that did not make our cutoff  is located on the same strand as the gcra tss and almost completely overlaps the strong motif. the regulatory significance of this arrangement is unknown, but we speculate that ctra may mediate a complex mechanism of both activation and repression at the gcra promoter.

de novo promoter motif discovery
of the  <dig>  protein-coding genes for which we did not identify a promoter,  <dig>  lacked tss with ≥ <dig> reads. the remaining  <dig>  genes had one or more tss , but lacked an upstream promoter prediction. these may represent genes transcribed by σ <dig>  σ <dig>  σe <dig>  σe <dig>  σe <dig>  σh <dig>  or σh <dig>  but whose promoters contain atypical core motifs, or genes whose promoters are recognized by one more of the other eight s. meliloti σ factors . in order to determine whether any of these genes lacking a promoter prediction share similar, as yet to be identified promoter motifs, we extracted sequences  <dig> nt upstream of high coverage tss  and used them as input for meme  <cit> ; methods). using this set of  <dig> upstream sequences, we identified three motifs with e-values of <  <dig> . motif  <dig> was identified upstream of  <dig> genes and consists of a conserved upstream ttg and a conserved downstream a residue . in addition to genes lacking an annotated function , the list includes genes involved in housekeeping, transport, metabolic, and regulatory functions . therefore, we speculate that motif  <dig> corresponds to genes transcribed by rpod that possess a conserved ttg motif, but lack other features of the rpod consensus sequence . motif  <dig> contains a central tttgttaaccat sequence and was identified upstream of  <dig> genes , 84% of which were previously shown to have high expression in rich medium, yet decreased expression in nodule bacteria and during heat shock  <cit> . motif  <dig> does not appear to match any previously identified s. meliloti promoter motifs or any motifs in the manually curated prokaryotic pssm database, regtransbase  <cit> . motif  <dig>  was identified upstream of  <dig> genes , five of which were previously identified as feup-dependent  <cit> . feup encodes a response regulator required for bacterial invasion of root nodules and activation of at least  <dig> genes  <cit> , including ndva encoding a cyclic σ-glucan exporter, and feun, a negative modulator of the feupq pathway that is predicted to be cotranscribed with feupq   <cit> . we checked whether motif  <dig> was present upstream of the remaining nine feup-dependent genes: three  had motifs in appropriate distance upstream of tss and three had motifs upstream of orfs for which tss were not identified . therefore, we suggest that motif  <dig> is a candidate feup binding site. in sum, our identification of three novel motifs upstream of tss demonstrates the utility of global tss data as a discovery tool.

the s. meliloti rpoe <dig>  regulon
 the s. meliloti ecf σ factor, rpoe <dig> , responds to heat shock, osmotic stress, oxidative stress, and carbon/nitrogen starvation during stationary phase growth  <cit> , activating expression of at least  <dig> genes  <cit> . most α-proteobacteria possess rpoe2-like σ factors and their role was proposed to be analogous to that of rpos in e. coli <cit> . the activity of σe <dig> is controlled by a partner switching mechanism, which includes negative regulation via two paralogous anti-σ factors, rsia <dig>  and rsia <dig> , and positive regulation via two anti-anti-σ factors, rsib <dig>  and rsib <dig>   <cit> . rsib <dig> and rsib <dig> each contain a c-terminal receiver domain, which is phosphorylated by an unidentified histidine kinase, allowing the n-terminal ecf σ-like domain to interact with rsia <dig> or rsia <dig>  thereby relieving inhibition of σe <dig> <cit> .

a previous study identified rpoe2-dependent genes in s. meliloti  <dig> by comparing transcription profiles of an rpoe <dig> mutant and wild type during heat shock  <cit> . to identify additional rpoe <dig> target genes, independent of any specific stress condition, and to verify rpoe2-dependent regulation of genes associated with putative σe <dig> tss identified in this study, we used custom affymetrix genechips to obtain transcription profiles of s. meliloti strains either overexpressing rpoe <dig> from an inducible promoter or carrying the empty vector . as mentioned above,  s. meliloti  <dig> has a defective ecfr <dig> gene, resulting in high constitutive rpoe <dig>  activity. sigma factors compete with each other for rnap  <cit> ; therefore, to maximize the amount of rnap-σe <dig>  and presumably enhance identification of σe <dig> targets, we performed our experiments in a strain containing a functional ecfr <dig> gene .

 our analyses revealed that  <dig> protein-coding genes displayed more than twofold increased transcript abundance in the strain overexpressing rpoe <dig>  whereas three mrnas showed lower abundance . the majority of the protein-coding genes  lack a predicted function . about 95% of rpoe2-dependent transcripts previously identified by microarray  <cit> , showed increased expression in the rpoe <dig> overexpressing strain. in addition, we identified  <dig> new rpoe2-dependent protein-coding genes ,  <dig> of which confirm previous in silico predictions  <cit> . overall, ~72% of rpoe2-dependent protein-coding genes had one or more mapped tss in our rnaseq data .

 as expected, expression of regulatory genes rpoh <dig> , rpoe <dig> , rsia <dig> , and rsib <dig>  was rpoe2-dependent; moreover, each of these genes has an mtss downstream from an rpoe2-dependent promoter . in addition, we identified tss with σe <dig> motifs upstream of two operons encoding rpoe2-dependent response regulator-histidine kinase pairs: sma0113/ <dig> and exsfg . these observations demonstrate the complexity of the rpoe <dig> regulatory circuit and suggest that rpoe <dig> overexpression may result in multiple, secondary regulatory effects. thus,  <dig> rpoe2-dependent protein-coding genes possess a tss preceded by a σe2-binding motif: these are likely directly controlled by σe <dig>  while transcription of the remaining genes likely depends on other σ factors . for example,  <dig> rpoe2-dependent operons were previously shown to be rpoh-dependent  <cit> . fifteen  of these had an rnaseq tss preceded by a promoter prediction for rpoe <dig> , rpoh , or both  .

 in addition to detecting mrnas corresponding to protein-coding genes, our custom affymetrix chip detects transcriptional activity for igrs ≥  <dig> nt. the strain overexpressing rpoe <dig> showed increased hybridization, compared to the control strain, to  <dig> probe sets, corresponding to  <dig> igrs, and decreased hybridization to two probe sets . our rnaseq approach detected transcripts corresponding to  <dig> of these igrs. about 60% of igrs showing rpoe2-dependent hybridization are adjacent to rpoe2-dependent protein-coding genes, and therefore likely represent 5′- or 3′-utr of those genes . igrs corresponding to 5′-utrs of six genes sma <dig>  sma <dig>  smb <dig>  smb <dig>  smc <dig>  and smc <dig> showed increased expression in the rpoe <dig> overexpressing strain that did not correlate with that of their corresponding coding regions ; however, we confirmed rpoe <dig> dependence for three of these by 5′ race mapping . five protein-coding genes, newly identified in this study, correlated with rpoe2-dependent igrs identified by affymetrix analysis .

 σe <dig> promoter motifs were predicted upstream of  <dig> srnas . our microarray data provides evidence for rpoe2-dependent transcription in eight igrs where srna genes are located: smela <dig>  smela <dig>  sma_srna_ <dig>  smb_srna_ <dig>  smb_srna_ <dig> , smb_srna_ <dig> , smc_srna_ <dig>  and smc_srna_ <dig> . this suggests that srna mediated post-transcriptional control is part of the rpoe <dig> regulatory circuit.

σe <dig> promoter motifs were identified upstream of  <dig> asrnas . at the post-transcriptional level, cis-encoded asrnas and trans-encoded srnas may play a role in complex regulatory circuits by allowing for interference between transcripts of different σ factor regulons. for example, eight rpoe2-dependent asrnas are located in antisense to genes are predicted to be controlled by σ <dig>  σh or both . figure 5b shows an example for the σe2-dependent smc_asrna_ <dig>  which may interact with the σ70-dependent smc <dig> mrna. in addition,  <dig> asrnas were found in antisense to rpoe2-dependent genes. we predicted binding motifs for σ <dig>  σh, or both, upstream of  <dig> of these asrnas. an example is the σ70-dependent smc_asrna_ <dig>  which may interact with the rpoe2-dependent smc <dig> mrna . these observations strongly support the hypothesis that asrnas belonging to a distinct σ factor regulon can interact with targets of different σ factor regulons.

5′ race mapping of rpoe2-dependent transcripts
to confirm rnaseq and affymetrix data, we chose  <dig> genes for 5′ race  mapping . for these experiments, we used the same rna samples as were used for the affymetrix analyses. because igr probe sets on our custom affymetrix genechip are a low-resolution means of delineating transcript structure, we examined tss and rpoe <dig> dependence for putative srnas, newly identified orfs, and 5′-utr detected by these igr probe sets. also, since rpoe <dig> was shown to activate expression of rpoh <dig> <cit> , we tested seven rpoe2-dependent genes whose expression was previously shown to be rpoh-dependent  <cit> . as controls, we included two regulatory genes whose expression was not rpoe2-dependent, rpoh <dig> and rsia <dig>  results of 5′ race mapping are provided in additional file 5: table s <dig>  and gel photos showing results for four representative transcripts are shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  of the  <dig> race mapped genes,  <dig> had tss in the rnaseq data, and all but three of these tss matched our race determined start sites exactly. rpoe <dig> dependence was confirmed qualitatively by 5′ race for all genes tested except for smb <dig>  and as expected, rpoh <dig> and rsia <dig>  most mapped promoters had upstream matches to the rpoe <dig> promoter consensus sequence, thus the corresponding genes are likely direct targets of rpoe <dig>  two genes previously identified as rpoh-dependent , had rpoh-like promoters.

CONCLUSIONS
to our knowledge, this study reports the first genome-wide rnaseq identification of tss in an α-proteobacterium. our approach defined a set of  <dig>  tss that provides mrna start sites for ~45% of s. meliloti protein-coding genes and identifies new orfs and ncrnas, including asrnas complementary to about one third of protein-coding genes. over  <dig>  tss are preceded by at least one predicted promoter sequence, representing potential target promoters for nearly half of the known s. meliloti σ factors. as promoter consensus sequences become available for the remaining σ factors, our data set can be used to identify target genes of these σ factors. also, we demonstrated how tss identification on a global scale aids in discovery of novel promoter motifs and transcription factor binding sites. combined with our affymetrix genechip analyses, the rnaseq data expand the known regulon of the σ factor, rpoe <dig>  and identify candidate ncrnas that may be involved in the s. meliloti general stress response. in sum, our work provides a rich resource for continued study of s. meliloti gene expression and regulatory circuits, as well as a foundation for comparative studies of transcription in other α-proteobacterial species.
