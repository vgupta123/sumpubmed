BACKGROUND
two translation termination factors, erf <dig> and erf <dig>  participate in termination of protein synthesis in eukaryotes . in s. cerevisiae they are encoded by sup <dig> and sup <dig>  respectively . in eukaryotes, a single factor, erf <dig> , decodes all three stop codons, while erf <dig>  stimulates termination through a gtp-dependent mechanism by forming a complex with erf <dig> 

eukaryotic cells possess a mechanism known as nonsense-mediated mrna decay  to recognize and degrade mrna molecules that contain premature termination codon  . the nmd process is mediated by the trans-acting factors upf <dig>  upf <dig> and upf <dig>  <cit> , all of which directly interact with erf3; while only upf <dig> interacts with erf <dig>  <cit> . using in vitro competition experiments, it has been demonstrated that upf <dig>  upf <dig> and erf <dig> actually compete with each other for binding to erf <dig>  <cit> . deletion of any one of the three upf genes selectively stabilizes mrnas that are degraded by the nmd pathway without affecting other mrnas  <cit> . genetic studies have shown that upf <dig>  upf <dig>  and upf <dig> act as obligate partners in the nmd pathway; this means that nmd only occurs when all components are present . mutations or deletions of upf genes lead to an increased frequency of nonsense suppression at termination codons in a variety of yeast genes . a mutation in the gtp-binding motifs of erf <dig> impairs the erf1-binding ability and not only causes a defect in translation termination but also slows normal and nonsense-mediated mrna decay, suggesting that gtp/erf3-dependent termination exerts its influence on the subsequent mrna degradation  <cit> . taken together these results suggest a direct link between the termination complex and the mrna stability.

both erf <dig> and erf <dig> are essential for viability of yeast cells and deletion of the c-terminal part of each protein separately lead to lethality . nonsense sup <dig> mutations have been obtained in the presence of suq <dig> suppressor trna  <cit> . however, we have isolated non-lethal nonsense mutations in the sup <dig> gene of s. cerevisiae which lead to decreased level of erf <dig>  <cit> . nonsense mutations were also obtained in the sup <dig> gene  <cit> . here, we show that sup <dig> nonsense and missense mutations have an inhibitory effect on nmd. our observation that loss of upf <dig> suppresses many of the pleiotropic phenotypes caused by mutations in sup <dig> allowed us to discuss the role of the upf complex in translation termination.

RESULTS
the sup <dig> mutations cause a general decrease in the efficiency of nmd
in previous work, we have isolated non-lethal nonsense and missense mutations in the essential sup <dig> gene of s. cerevisiae which lead to a high level of suppression  <cit> . since a direct link between the termination complex and the mrna stability was proposed, we examined the efficiency of nmd in these mutants by testing whether a decrease in erf <dig> level will lead to accumulation of ptc-containing transcripts.

the abundance of the precursor and mature cyh <dig> mrna levels can be used to monitor nmd, because it has been shown that inefficiently spliced cyh <dig> pre-mrna containing a premature termination codon is degraded by nmd pathway  <cit> . in the present paper, we show that the accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna is affected by nmd pathway. the strain 1b-d <dig> in which sup <dig> mutants were obtained, contains nonsense mutations in his <dig>  lys <dig> and trp <dig> genes. as shown in table  <dig>  sequence analysis of the his7- <dig>  lys9-a <dig> and trp1- <dig> alleles identified the presence of single nonsense mutations. it is known that destabilization of mrnas by nmd depends on the position of the nonsense codon and the presence of a dse  downstream of mutation . indeed, while mrnas with nonsense codons occurring in the last  <dig> to 30% of the coding region retain their wild-type decay rates, mrnas harboring ptc in the first two-third of the gene are subject to degradation by nmd. the his7- <dig> nonsense mutation is located at the beginning of his <dig> mrna and is followed by two putative dse , suggesting that his7- <dig> transcript could be a substrate for nmd.

a the downstream sequences were searched for the presence of dse   <cit> . the numbers above the sequences indicate the 5' boundaries of putative dse  in the corresponding open reading frame ; nd – not detected. b codon changes in the case of each mutation are shown, nucleotide changes are underlined.

to check if his7- <dig> transcript is affected by nmd, two isogenic strains were constructed harboring the his7- <dig> allele together with upf <dig> or upf1Δ. for this purpose, the strain 5b-d <dig>  was transformed with prs <dig> and prs316/upf <dig> plasmids. the mean steady-state level of the his7- <dig> mrna was  <dig>  fold higher in the upf1Δ cells than in upf <dig> cells . however, the level of wild-type his <dig> mrna was not affected by deletion of upf <dig> . the steady-state level of ade1- <dig>  another nonsense-containing transcript, did not depend on deletion of upf <dig> . therefore, the deletion of upf <dig> gene affects the his7- <dig> transcript in precisely the same manner that it affects the cyh <dig> pre-mrna demonstrating that his7- <dig> is a potential substrate for nmd. earlier it was shown that deletion of upf <dig> gene promotes suppression of some but not all nonsense mutations  <cit> . indeed, we did not detect suppression of his7- <dig> mutation on sc-his medium in strain 5b-d <dig> bearing upf1Δ .

we studied nmd efficiency in sup <dig> mutant strains by examination of cyh <dig> and his7- <dig> mrna levels. first, we have shown that the mrna level of wild-type his <dig> mrna in sup45-n mutants and upf1Δ mutants is not changed . next, we used strains harboring nonsense mutations sup45-  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  which lead to decrease of erf <dig> full-length protein level  <cit>  and the sup45- <dig>  missense-mutation  <cit> . total rna was isolated from mutants and analyzed by northern blots using probes specific for cyh <dig> and his7- <dig> mrna. strains bearing sup45-n mutations had a significantly increased cyh <dig> pre-mrna/rna ratio  compared with that of wild-type sup <dig> strain . a similar increase was also observed for sup45- <dig> missense mutant  . similarly, the relative abundance of his7- <dig> mrna in the sup45-n mutant strains, normalized using act <dig> mrna, ranged from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  compared with that of wild-type sup <dig> strain  . the strain harboring missense mutation sup45- <dig> was also characterized by the accumulation of the his7- <dig> transcript . this effect was weaker than that observed for upf <dig> deletion which causes  <dig> and  <dig>  fold increases in the cyh <dig> pre-mrna/rna ratio and the accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna, respectively , however it appears specific for nmd substrates since the amounts of other nonsense-containing transcripts  were not significantly changed in sup <dig> mutants . we also observed a significant increase of the cyh <dig> pre-mrna/rna ratio and of his7- <dig> mrna level in strains bearing sup <dig> nonsense and missense mutations . taken together, these results demonstrate that both nonsense and missense mutations in sup <dig> decrease the efficiency of mrna degradation by nmd thus leading to accumulation of mrnas containing ptcs.

increased viability of sup <dig> nonsense mutants in the absence of upf1
previously, we have shown that sup <dig> nonsense mutants are viable in different genetic backgrounds  <cit> . however, the efficiency of plasmid shuffle was significantly lower in the case of mutant sup45-n alleles compared to plasmid bearing wild-type sup <dig> gene  <cit>  indicating that sup45-n mutations imperfectly replace sup <dig>  to assess the effects of double sup <dig> upf <dig> mutations on viability of corresponding strains we performed plasmid shuffle analysis using strains bearing single sup <dig> mutations or sup <dig> in combination with upf1Δ .

two nonsense mutations resulting in different stop codons  and sup45- <dig> ) and one missense mutation  were used to perform plasmid shuffle experiments. two isogenic yeast strains 1a-d <dig>  and 1-1a-d <dig>  were transformed with the prs <dig> plasmids bearing the wild-type sup <dig> gene or different sup <dig> mutations. transformants were then subjected to plasmid shuffle analysis to verify whether strains containing the sup <dig> alleles could lose the plasmid carrying the wild-type gene. in the sup45Δ strain, all transformants were able to grow in the presence of 5-foa, indicating that all tested mutations can replace wild-type sup <dig>  however, as previously described  <cit> , plasmid shuffle was less efficient with sup <dig> mutations than with wild-type sup <dig>  surprisingly, introduction of upf1Δ mutation lead to increased viability of sup <dig> mutants . we did not observe difference in growth between wild-type and sup <dig> mutants on medium selective for both plasmids . in order to check that deletion of upf <dig> does not lead to higher production of erf <dig> protein in double sup <dig> upf1Δ mutants which could explain the increased viability of these mutants, we analyzed erf <dig> protein level by western blot. as shown in figure 3b, deletion of upf <dig> does not affect the level of erf <dig> protein in sup <dig> mutants.

the same experiment was repeated using two other strains, 3b-d <dig>  and 3v-d <dig> . these strains were transformed with the prs <dig> plasmids bearing the wild-type sup <dig> gene or different sup <dig> mutations, leu+ ura+ transformants were patched on 5-foa medium to select against prs316/sup <dig> plasmid . the same results were obtained. again, introduction of upf1Δ mutation leads to increased viability of sup <dig> mutants . western blot analyses showed that deletion of upf <dig> did not affect levels of erf <dig> and erf <dig> proteins in sup <dig> mutants . thus, deletion of upf <dig> confers selective survival advantages to sup <dig> nonsense mutants.

deletion of the upf <dig> gene suppresses several sup <dig> phenotypes
it is known that mutations in the sup <dig> gene lead to suppression of nonsense mutations and also to many phenotypic changes including high or low temperature sensitivity, respiratory efficiency and sensitivity to aminoglycoside antibiotics such as paromomycin . it has been previously reported that loss the upf <dig> gene results in the suppression of some but not all of nonsense mutations. in addition, deletion of upf <dig> does not confer sensitivity to paromomycin  <cit> , an aminoglycoside antibiotic that induces translational misreading. we therefore compared phenotypes of single sup <dig> and double sup <dig> upf1Δ mutants, previously obtained by plasmid shuffle, for suppression efficiency, temperature sensitivity and sensitivity to paromomycin. as previously described  <cit> , nonsense sup45- <dig> and sup45- <dig> and missense sup45- <dig> mutations are temperature sensitive. we observed that deletion of upf <dig> suppressed temperature sensitivity of both sup45- <dig> and sup45- <dig> nonsense mutants in rich medium. however upf <dig> deletion did not suppress temperature sensitivity of sup45- <dig> missense mutant . the observed disparity in effect of upf <dig> deletion on temperature sensitivity of nonsense and missense mutants can be connected with different nature of temperature sensitivity in the case of decreased level of erf <dig> compared with mutated erf <dig>  loss of upf <dig> also restored growth of all sup <dig> mutants on paromomycin media . in addition, deletion of upf <dig> had an allosuppressor effect on suppression of ade1- <dig> mutation by sup <dig> mutations. however deletion of upf <dig> alone, in the presence of wild-type copy of the sup <dig> gene had no suppressor effect on ade1- <dig> mutation . on ypd medium, all transformants grew indicating that they retained their growth capacity on rich medium . therefore the analysis of sup <dig> upf1Δ double mutants shows that loss of upf <dig> not only affects viability of sup <dig> mutants but also suppresses several sup <dig> phenotypes.

defects of nmd in double mutants sup <dig> upf1Δ
we have previously shown that sup <dig> mutants affect nmd and that upf <dig> deletion suppresses several sup <dig> phenotypes. therefore, we next examined if upf <dig> deletion would have an additional effect on nmd in sup <dig> mutants. for this purpose, we compared accumulation of cyh <dig> precursor mrna in single sup <dig> mutants and sup <dig> upf1Δ double mutants. to this end, we transformed strain 3v-d <dig>  and its derivates  with plasmids prs <dig> or prs316/upf <dig>  in the presence of upf1Δ and wild-type sup <dig>  accumulation of cyh <dig> precursor increased by  <dig>  fold. we found that the presence of sup <dig> mutations increased the ratio of precyh <dig> to mature cyh <dig> mrna by  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold , in agreement with results obtained previously in a different genetic background . combination of sup45-n mutations and upf1Δ slightly but reproducibly increased the ratio of precyh <dig> to mature cyh <dig> mrna from  <dig>  to  <dig>  fold. therefore, these results indicate that the combination of sup45-n and upf <dig> mutations together increased accumulation of cyh <dig> precursor more than either single one.

to compare the effects of single sup <dig> mutations and the sup <dig> upf1Δ double mutations on the efficiency of suppression, we replica plated the same transformants that were used for nothern blots analysis  on adenine deprived medium. as shown in another genetic background , deletion of upf <dig> does not promote suppression of ade1- <dig> mutation  and the combined effects of sup <dig> mutations and upf1Δ promote increase in the suppression efficiency compared with sup <dig> mutations alone. as shown in figure 5d, allosuppression of ade1- <dig> by deletion of upf <dig> is not the result of stabilization of ade1- <dig> mrna in double sup <dig> upf1Δ mutants. we also showed that deletion of upf <dig> does not affect sup45-n mrnas and erf <dig> as well as erf <dig> protein levels .

deletion of either upf <dig> or upf <dig> increases viability of sup <dig> nonsense mutants
it has been described that functional nmd requires not only upf <dig> but also upf <dig> and upf <dig>  <cit> . to test whether upf <dig> or upf <dig> deletion will have the same effect on viability of sup <dig> nonsense mutants as deletion of upf <dig>  we transformed strains 4a-d <dig> , 4b-d <dig> , 18a-d <dig>  and 3a-d <dig> , all containing prs316/sup <dig>  plasmid, with prs315/sup45-n  plasmids carrying sup45- <dig> or sup45- <dig> mutant alleles. leu+ ura+ transformants were selected and plated on leucine deprived medium containing 5-foa to select against the prs316/sup <dig>  plasmid. combining either upf <dig> or upf <dig> deletion with sup <dig> mutations results in an enhanced viability of double mutants . western blot analysis has shown, as in case of upf <dig> deletion, that the level of erf <dig> and erf <dig> proteins was not dependent on the presence of functional upf <dig> or upf <dig> genes . these results demonstrate that deletion of upf <dig> or upf <dig> as well as deletion of upf <dig>  all essential components of nmd pathway, leads to increase viability of sup45-n mutant strains.

discussion
in the present work, we have shown that nonsense and missense mutations in the sup <dig> gene lead to stabilization of ptc-containing mrnas degraded by nmd. this is the first demonstration that sup <dig> mutations do not only change translation fidelity but also acts by causing a change in mrna stability.

the cyh <dig> pre-mrna which contains a premature termination codon was previously shown to be degraded by nmd pathway  <cit> . we also identified that nmd affects accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna. a single a→t mutation in this allele leads to change of codon  <dig> for uaa. in addition, two imperfect putative dse are found downstream of this premature stop codon. using a upf1Δ strain, we demonstrated that the his7- <dig> transcript is possibly under control of nmd pathway. in order to answer if changes in transcription of his <dig> gene could account for accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna, we examined the mrna level of wild-type his <dig> mrna in sup45-n mutants and upf1Δ mutants. deletion of upf <dig> as well as sup <dig> mutations leads to accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna but do not affect mrna level of wild-type his <dig> mrna. accordingly, a genome-wide analysis performed in strains depleted for nmd showed that wild-type his <dig> mrna  is not affected in strains deleted for upf <dig>  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate that accumulation of his7- <dig> and cyh <dig> precursor mrnas in cells bearing sup <dig> mutations was much higher than that observed in the wild-type strain. but, sup <dig> mutations do not promote accumulation of other nonsense-containing transcripts, such as ade1- <dig> or lys9-a <dig>  despite efficient suppression of these mutations, as well as his7- <dig>  <cit> . this result indicates that simply increasing read-through efficiency does not result in a general increase in the abundance of ptc-containing mrnas but that sup <dig> mutations specifically affect ptc-containing mrna subjected to nmd. we observed that the abundance of his7- <dig> and cyh <dig> precursor mrnas in cells bearing sup <dig> mutations was lower compared to those in the upf1Δ strain. this difference between upf1Δ and sup <dig> mutants could be explained by the complete absence of upf <dig> protein in the upf1Δ strain leading to complete inactivation of nmd and by the presence of some functional erf <dig> protein in sup <dig> mutants which is necessary for cell viability  <cit> . indeed, we previously reported that in the case of sup45-n, the level of erf <dig> is decreased compared to wild-type and in the case of sup <dig> missense mutants the level of erf <dig> is unchanged but its functionality is altered. these results demonstrate that erf <dig> participates in nmd.

recently, it was shown the importance of the second translation termination factor  for nmd and interaction of both erf <dig> and erf <dig> with upf proteins. upf <dig> protein interacts with the polypeptide release factors erf <dig> and erf <dig> while they are still present in the ribosome-bound termination complex, providing a direct link between the termination complex and the nmd machinery  <cit> . both upf <dig> and upf <dig> interact with erf <dig>  but not with erf1; and upf <dig>  upf <dig> and erf <dig> compete with each other in vitro for binding to erf <dig>  <cit> . erf <dig> also interacts with poly-binding protein   <cit> , furthermore, erf <dig> regulates the initiation of normal mrna decay at the poly tail-shortening step through the interaction with pabp  <cit> . thus, erf <dig> can mediate normal and nonsense-mediated mrna decay through its association with pab <dig> and upf <dig> and therefore was proposed as a key mediator between translation termination and nmd  <cit> . moreover, it was previously shown that a weak translation termination due to   antagonizes the effects of nmd  <cit> . a first indication for a link between translation termination and nmd came from observations that decay of ptc-containing mrnas can be antagonized by trnas that suppress termination  <cit> . data have shown that normal termination is distinct from premature termination and this difference is dependent upon the presence of upf <dig> at the premature termination codon  <cit> . our results together with data about erf1-upf <dig> interaction  <cit>  demonstrate that erf <dig> as well as erf <dig> is an essential factor linking translation termination and nmd. recognition of stop codons is a common event necessary for the two processes. since it is established that erf <dig> plays a crucial role in translation termination by directly recognizing stop codons , erf <dig> could have an identical function in nmd by recognition of ptc.

we observed that the combination of upf1Δ and sup45-n mutations leads to an increase in cyh <dig> precursor mrna abundance that was higher than in upf1Δ and sup45-n single mutants. a similar additive effect on stabilization of nonsense-containing mrna was shown for combination of upf1Δ and   <cit> . therefore, a possible explanation for this additive effect of upf1Δ and sup45-n mutations could be that erf <dig> is required for both normal and nonsense-mediated mrna decay, as it was shown for erf <dig>  <cit> .

it has been shown that mutation in erf <dig> which impairs erf <dig> binding to erf <dig> affected mrna decay  <cit> . in the present paper, we show that the missense mutation sup45- <dig>  alters degradation of ptc-containing mrnas by nmd. however, we have previously shown that this mutation does not affect the erf1-erf <dig> interaction  <cit> , indicating that this allele has an inhibitory effect on nmd that is independent on erf1-erf <dig> binding. this result demonstrates that erf <dig> mutation affecting ptc-containing mrna decay by nmd does not obligatory alters the erf1-erf <dig> interaction.

a role for the upf <dig> protein, essential for nmd, in translation termination first became evident when a set of mutations were isolated in the upf <dig> gene that separated the mrna decay function from its activity in modulating premature termination  <cit> . subsequent studies have shown that deletion of either upf <dig> or upf <dig> can also lead to a nonsense suppression phenotype  <cit> . in addition, it was shown that upf1Δ mutation causes a general decrease in the efficiency of translation termination at uag, uaa, and uga stop codons  <cit> .

in this work, we have shown that deletion of upf <dig> does not affect ade1- <dig> mrna level, but results in allosuppression of ade1- <dig> mutation in sup <dig> nonsense mutants therefore revealing that deletion of upf <dig> has a synergistic effect with sup45-n mutants. similar allosuppressor effect has also been shown for deletion of upf <dig> in combination with   <cit> . based on this additive effect, keeling et al.  <cit>  proposed that upf1Δ mutation and  influence the termination process in distinct ways. our results suggest that this could be also the case for upf1Δ and sup <dig> mutations.

we found that deletion of the upf <dig> gene affects several other sup <dig> phenotypes, such as temperature sensitivity, paromomycin sensitivity and viability of sup <dig> mutants. it is known that deletion of upf <dig> gene in yeast does not cause any detectable phenotypic effects except respiratory deficiency  <cit>  and nonsense suppression  <cit> . also telomere length is affected by deletions of upf1- <dig> genes  <cit> . how upf <dig> deletion could affect sup <dig> phenotypes? we can not exclude an indirect effect of upf <dig> deletion on sup <dig> phenotypes. it has been reported that nmd controls the mrna levels of several hundred of wild-type genes  <cit> . one can hypothesize that depletion of upf <dig> could affect the expression of some translation apparatus components  which themselves influence the viability of sup <dig> mutants. indeed, the presence of suq <dig> mutation, a mutant suppressor trnaser, increases the viability of sup45-n mutants  <cit> . alternatively, since inactivation of the nmd pathway by upf1Δ mutation does not increase the steady-state levels of wild-type and mutant sup <dig> mrnas and does not cause a change in the amount of erf <dig> protein, we propose that the effect of nmd on sup <dig> phenotypes is probably via a change in the stoichiometry of factors involved in translation termination and nmd. in contrast to mammals, upf proteins of s. cerevisiae are present at very low intracellular concentrations  <cit> . considering that in sup45- <dig> and sup45- <dig> nonsense mutants the amount of erf <dig> was estimated as 8% and 17% of wild-type level, respectively  <cit> , in mutant cells erf <dig> and upf <dig> proteins are probably present in stoichiometric amounts. possibly, in wild-type cells, upf <dig> is not preventing normal termination because its amount is ten times lower than erf <dig>  but in the case of their presence in stoichiometric amounts in sup <dig> nonsense mutants binding of upf <dig> to erf <dig> could result in a defective complex formation that blocks termination. this hypothesis is supported by finding that viability of sup <dig> nonsense mutants depends also on upf <dig> or upf <dig> proteins. there is a possibility that effect of upf <dig> or upf <dig> depletion is indirect and is under control of upf <dig>  it was shown that in mammalian cells a depletion of upf <dig> or upf <dig> reduces the amount of the phosphorylated form of upf <dig> possibly preventing upf <dig> dissociation from erf <dig> and erf <dig>  <cit> . phosphorylation of upf <dig> and upf <dig> was also shown in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , an indication that this mechanism might operate in yeast cells as well.

from recent studies, it appears more and more clear that translation termination and mrna stability are intimately linked and our results demonstrate that erf <dig> is also an essential factor linking these two processes.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present work, we have shown hat nonsense and missense mutations in sup <dig> gene lead to stabilization of cyh <dig>  a ptc-containing pre-mrna degraded by nmd, and to accumulation of his7- <dig> mrna. at the same time, sup <dig> mutations do not promote accumulation of other nonsense-containing transcripts, such as ade1- <dig> or lys9-a <dig>  despite efficient suppression of these mutations. thus sup <dig> mutations specifically affect ptc-containing mrna subjected to nmd. deletion of upf <dig> results in allosuppression of ade1- <dig> mutation in sup <dig> nonsense mutants and leads to an increase in cyh <dig> pre-mrna abundance therefore revealing that deletion of upf <dig> has a synergistic effect with sup45-n mutants. this is the first demonstration that sup <dig> mutations do not only change translation fidelity but also acts by causing a change in mrna stability.

models explaining increased viability of sup <dig> nonsense mutants in the absence of upf <dig>  upf <dig> or upf <dig> proteins are proposed. first, the depletion of upf <dig> could affect the expression of some translation apparatus components  which themselves influence the viability of sup <dig> mutants. second, a change in the stoichiometry of factors involved in translation termination and nmd provides the effect of nmd on sup <dig> phenotypes.
