BACKGROUND
folate and vitamin b <dig> are essential vitamins derived from various food sources that play an important role in erythropoiesis, dna biosynthesis, and embryogenesis. nutritional deficiencies or genetic variations that impact folate and/or vitamin b <dig> homeostasis may result in megaloblastic anemia  <cit> , and failure of maternal-fetal transport of these nutrients has been shown to adversely impact normal embryogenesis  <cit> . folate is a vitamin derived from plant sources that consists of a pteridine ring structure attached to a para-aminobenzoic acid side chain. tetrahydrofolate, the reduced form of folate, functions as an important co-factor for donating or accepting methyl groups. adequate levels of folate for the incorporation of single carbon groups into purine, or methylation of deoxyuridylate to form thymidylate, are necessary for dna biosynthesis. vitamin b <dig>  also known as cobalamin, is another important vitamin that is obtained from dietary sources such as meat, fish and soybean. folate and cobalamin metabolism are highly interdependent. in mammals, cobalamin functions as a co-enzyme for methionine synthase, which is involved in the tetrahydrofolate-dependent methylation of homocysteine to methionine  <cit> . according to the "folate-trap hypothesis", cobalamin deficiency results in 'trapping' of tetrahydrofolate, producing a functional folate deficiency that leads to impaired erythropoiesis and dna biosynthesis  <cit> .

the primary mechanisms for folate delivery into the cell are through  carrier-mediated  or  receptor-mediated  processes. these two transport systems are distinguished by their unique patterns of tissue expression, differing protein structures, specificities for oxidized vs. reduced folates, and divergent mechanisms for transmembrane transport of folates  <cit> . as mammalian cells are not capable of synthesizing folates de novo, these two transport systems play a critical role in mediating folate uptake for the biosynthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and certain amino acids that are necessary for cell survival and proliferation. it has recently been discovered that megalin, a large multiligand endocytic receptor of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, is capable of binding and mediating uptake of the soluble form of the gpi-anchored folate receptor folr <dig>  providing yet another pathway for the cellular internalization of folate  <cit> .

the principal route of folate transport into mammalian cells is via the reduced folate carrier , a bidirectional transporter characterized by twelve transmembrane domains  <cit> . rfc <dig> preferentially transports reduced folates, such as n5-methyltetrahydrofolate or n5-formyltetrahydrofolate, which are anionic at physiological ph. it functions as a facilitative anion exchanger, capable of transporting anionic folates into the cell via a co-transport system in which the uphill transport of folate is coupled to the downhill efflux of organic phosphates or sulfates  <cit> . folate uptake into intestinal cells is markedly increased at ph  <dig>  relative to ph  <dig>   <cit> , suggesting that rfc1-mediated folate uptake is highly dependent on acidic extracellular ph. in adult tissues, rfc <dig> expression is observed in the brush border of the small and large intestine, and in the basolateral membrane of renal tubular epithelium, as well as in hepatocytes, choroid plexus, and the retinal pigment epithelium  <cit> . during development, rfc <dig> is highly expressed in multiple tissue types, including the placenta and yolk sac, neural tube, craniofacial region, limb buds and heart  <cit> .

we have recently characterized the role of rfc <dig> during embryonic development in a mouse model in which rfc <dig> was inactivated by homologous recombination  <cit> . without maternal folate supplementation, rfc1-/- embryos die in utero shortly after implantation. rfc1-/- embryos harvested from dams receiving low doses of supplemental folic acid , survive to mid-gestation , but are developmentally delayed, and display multiple malformations, including severe neural tube defects, craniofacial, heart, and limb abnormalities. examination of the placenta reveals that embryolethality is due to a failure of chorioallantoic fusion. the fetal vasculature appears to form normally, but there is a pronounced absence of erythropoiesis, with very few nucleated fetal red blood cells present in either the fetal blood vessels or the yolk sac blood islands. maternal folate supplementation with  <dig> mg/kg/day results in survival to term of 22% of the rfc <dig> mutants, although the surviving fetuses present with multiple malformations of the craniofacies, lungs, heart and skin.

the reduced folate carrier gene has previously been inactivated in a mouse model  <cit>  through targeted disruption of a large part of exon  <dig>  zhao  <cit>  reported that the rfc1-/- embryos died in utero before e <dig> , but near-normal development could be sustained by supplementing pregnant rfc+/- dams with daily doses of  <dig> mg folic acid sq. approximately 10% of the partially rescued rfc1-/- pups were live-born, but all died within  <dig> days post-partum. in the zhao  <cit> rfc <dig> knockout mouse model, perinatal lethality was attributed to a marked absence of erythropoiesis in bone marrow, spleen, and liver. our recent findings indicate that inactivation of rfc <dig> results in congenital malformations of the heart and lungs that undoubtedly contribute to the failure of rfc <dig> mutants to survive postnatally.

the purpose of this report is to identify alterations in biochemical and/or molecular genetic pathways that may play a role in the abnormal embryonic morphogenesis observed following inactivation of rfc <dig>  in the current study, the gene expression profiles of whole e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos were compared to that of rfc1+/+ littermates harvested from pregnant dams receiving daily low dose  folate supplementation. our microarray analysis shows that in the absence of functional rfc <dig>  the expression profiles of numerous transcription factors, as well as several genes involved in hematopoiesis, ion homeostasis, and genes encoding for receptors and/or ligands in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex are significantly altered. follow-up quantitative rt-pcr validation confirms alterations in the expression profiles of several ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-megalin complex that are involved in nutrient transport of vitamins and lipids to the developing embryo.

RESULTS
microarray analysis
in the microarray analysis of e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos vs. rfc1+/+ embryos, the expression patterns of  <dig> genes were found to be significantly altered at the  <dig>  level. however, when looking at the false discovery rate , only  <dig> genes  were significantly altered at the  <dig>  level. several of the probe sets represent alternate transcripts for the same gene. taking this into account,  <dig> unique genes were identified as differentially expressed in the microarray analysis. of these,  <dig> represent known genes, while  <dig> are ests or unknowns. the  <dig> known genes in our data set that have been identified as cell surface receptors, ligands, or interacting proteins in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex are listed in table  <dig>  and the complete set of  <dig> known genes that were differentially expressed following statistical analysis of the microarray data are also provided . the genes have been categorized according to ontology groups, and the file contains the accession number, gene symbol, gene name, and the mean fold change for the expression level of each gene. the fold-change represents the value for the comparison of level of gene expression in the rfc1-/- embryos relative to the rfc1+/+ embryos. .

distribution of gene ontology groups
a pie chart showing the relative distribution  of the gene ontology groups identified in the microarray analysis of the rfc1-/- vs. rfc1+/+ embryos is shown in figure  <dig>  the largest ontology group of known genes that was altered included several families of transcription factors , followed by genes involved in transport functions  . genes that code for receptors, ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex account for  <dig> % of the total, followed closely by several genes involved in hematopoiesis .

ingenuity pathway analysis
the most highly significant gene network identified in the ingenuity pathway analysis  of our affymetrix microarray data is shown in figure  <dig>  based on new information available in the recent literature , we identified an additional  <dig> genes of interest that were placed into this network. these additional genes are represented by  <dig> custom nodes and edges. in the original "network 1" of the ingenuity pathway analysis,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes that appear were statistically up or down-regulated on our microarray analysis, giving it a score of  <dig>  with the addition of the custom nodes/edges  and nodes from the cubn neighborhood– {*genes that already appear in the default "network 1"}  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in the custom network were found to be significant. many of the key genes highlighted in this top network are members of the ontology group that includes receptors, ligands and interacting proteins found in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex. this complex became the focus of further studies due to its important role in the uptake of folate and other vitamins, lipids, and nutrients essential for embryonic development.

cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex
a diagram of the structure of the cubilin-amnionless-megalin multiligand receptor endocytic complex is shown in figure  <dig> <cit> . megalin and cubilin are two multifunctional endocytic receptors that act in concert in certain tissues to mediate the uptake of a variety of lipoproteins and vitamin-carrier complexes  <cit> . striking similarities in temporal and spatial expression patterns of megalin and cubilin have been described in mid-late gestation rat embryos  <cit> , although differential patterns of expression have also been reported during early embryonic development in the mouse  <cit> . megalin  is a low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein that is co-expressed with cubilin in many absorptive epithelia, including the neuroepithelium and yolk sac of developing embryos. several studies indicate a critical role for megalin in normal embryogenesis  <cit> . megalin has been shown to bind and internalize multiple ligands, including the soluble folate binding protein , and sonic hedgehog , among others  <cit> . lack of megalin receptor function in a knockout mouse model results in abnormalities of the kidneys, lungs, central nervous system and craniofacies, and megalin-deficient pups die perinatally within the first few minutes of life due to respiratory insufficiency  <cit> . conditional inactivation of megalin in the neuroepithelium has been shown to result in a loss of shh expression in the ventral telencephalon  <cit> , indicating that megalin-mediated uptake of shh in the neuroepithelium is critical for early forebrain development  <cit> .

cubilin  functions as an endocytic receptor for the intrinsic factor-cobalamin complex in the intestine, and as a receptor for apolipoprotein a <dig> and albumin reabsorption in the kidney proximal tubules and visceral yolk sac  <cit> . cubilin is a peripheral membrane receptor comprised of a short amino terminal amphipathic helix, eight egf type domains, and  <dig> amino acid modules known as cub domains  <cit> . although cubilin lacks a classic transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail, the amino-terminal end is necessary for membrane anchoring  <cit> . the amino-terminal region of cubilin is attached to the extracellular part of amnionless, which provides the transmembrane domain necessary for anchoring and endocytic trafficking of cubilin  <cit> . antibodies directed against cubilin have been reported to have teratogenic effects in rats  <cit> , and targeted disruption of cubilin in a mouse model reveals an essential role for this receptor in embryogenesis  <cit> . homozygous inactivation of the murine cubilin gene results in embryolethality between e <dig>  – e <dig> . cubilin knockout mice are characterized by defects in certain mesodermally-derived tissues, including failure of somite formation and abnormalities of the yolk sac blood islands and visceral endoderm  <cit> .

a comparative overview of the developmental phenotype of mice with genetically engineered deletions in critical components of the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex including cubilin, amnionless, megalin, receptor-associated protein , and disabled homolog- <dig> is provided . the phenotypes of these mutants are compared to the developmental anomalies observed following genetically engineered deletions in the folate transporters folr <dig> and rfc <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos on low dose maternal folate supplementation  display certain phenotypic traits in common with the more severely affected cubilin, amnionless, and dab <dig> knockouts, including failure of chorioallantoic fusion and defects in mesoderm-derived structures, whereas rfc1-/- embryos that survive to term following high dose maternal folate supplementation display a range of malformations more similar to the megalin knockout mutants.

quantitative real-time pcr validation
genes in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex identified in the affymetrix microarray analysis, ingenuity pathway analysis, or through additional information available in the literature were selected for further expression analysis by quantitative rt-pcr . the twelve genes selected for qrt-pcr validation of alterations in gene expression are listed along with a description of their function, and the abi primer/probe sets used for these experiments . figure  <dig> and table  <dig> list the results of the qrt-pcr analysis, including p-values, and a graph of the relative levels of expression of the selected genes in the multiligand receptor endocytic complex is shown. cubn, apoa <dig>  amn, trf, timd <dig>  rbp <dig>  ttr, and the gpi-anchored folate receptor  are significantly upregulated in e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos relative to e <dig>  rfc1+/+ littermates . however, the qrt-pcr analysis did not detect statistically significant changes in the expression of lrp <dig>  lrpap <dig>  dab <dig>  or shh. error bars represent sem values.

although neither folr <dig> nor megalin gene expression made the cut-off for statistical significance on our microarray analysis, we included them in our qrt-pcr analysis because of their presence in the multiligand endocytic receptor complex, and their important role in nutrient delivery to the developing embryo . qrt-pcr results demonstrated no significant difference in message levels of megalin between the two groups, but a 10-fold increase in folr <dig> expression was detected  in rfc1-/-relative to rfc+/+ littermates. rt-pcr validation also demonstrates a highly significant upregulation of cubilinmessage in rfc1-/- embryos . amn mediates cell-surface localization and endocytic function of cubilin in the visceral endoderm  <cit> . amn did not make the list of  <dig> genes identified as statistically significant in our microarray analysis using the stringent cut-off of  <dig>  for adjusted p-values . however, due to its critical role in cubilin expression and function, we chose to further analyze amnionless gene expression levels by quantitative rt-pcr. our results show that, similar to cubilin, the expression of amnionless was highly significantly upregulated  in rfc1-/- embryos.

immunohistochemistry
during normal embryonic development, megalin and cubilin are highly expressed in the visceral endoderm  and visceral yolk sac , and function cooperatively in the maternal-fetal transfer of multiple nutrients and morphogens. the ve is a polarized epithelial tissue that surrounds the developing epiblast. the apical surface of the ve faces maternal tissues, and contains numerous microvilli that function to absorb nutrients from the maternal environment  <cit> . additional roles in patterning anterior-posterior polarity of the early embryo, correct positioning of the primitive streak, induction of blood precursors, and forebrain development have been ascribed to the anterior ve  <cit> . following implantation, the ve surrounding the epiblast differentiates to form the vys. the vys continues to play a critical role in maternal-fetal nutrient and waste exchange prior to establishment of the chorioallantoic placenta  <cit> .

immunohistochemical expression of cubilin, megalin and folr <dig> protein in e <dig>  rfc1+/+ and rfc1-/- embryos and extra-embryonic membranes was examined. expression of cubilin, megalin and folr <dig> protein in the visceral yolk sac  is shown in figure  <dig>  cubilin , megalin  and folr <dig>  protein are all highly expressed on the apical side of the vys in e <dig>  rfc1+/+ embryos . cubilin is also highly expressed on the apical side of the vys in e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos . megalin expression, however, is completely absent from the vys of rfc <dig> mutants . folr <dig> protein expression is absent from the apical plasma membrane of the vys in rfc1-/- embryos, but demonstrates increased expression in the endothelial cell layer of the yolk sac blood islands .

expression of cubilin and megalin protein in the neuroepithelium is shown in figure  <dig>  megalin expression is observed in the retinal pigment epithelium, cells lining the otic vesicle, and exclusively on the apical side of neuroepithelial cells  in e <dig>  rfc1+/+ embryos . in rfc1-/- embryos, however, megalin is expressed on both the apical  and basolateral side  of the neuroepithelium. positive staining for megalin is also observed in the surface ectoderm, notochord, pericardium, and endothelial cells lining vascular structures  of rfc1+/+ embryos, but megalin staining is faint or absent in the  notochord and endothelium of similar vascular structures in rfc <dig> mutant embryos . similar to megalin, cubilin expression is observed in the surface ectoderm , retinal pigment epithelium, otic vesicle, and apical side of neuroepithelial cells  in e <dig>  rfc1+/+embryos. in rfc1-/- embryos, however, cubilin is misexpressed on the basolateral side of neuroepithelial cells , discrete, positive staining for cubilin is observed in the notochord of rfc1+/+ embryos . in contrast, the expression of cubilin protein appears to be highly upregulated and widespread throughout the  mesenchyme underlying the neural tube  of rfc1-/- embryos, especially in the region surrounding the notochord . cubilin staining is present in the pericardium of both rfc <dig> wildtype  and mutant embryos. although there are a few cells that stain positive for cubilin in the trabeculae of the common ventricular chamber in the rfc <dig> wildtype heart, cubilin expression is dramatically upregulated throughout the myocardium of the developing heart in rfc <dig> mutants .

discussion
in the present study, microarray analysis of gene expression in whole e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos vs. rfc1+/+ littermates was utilized as a tool for discovering genetic pathways disrupted in the absence of rfc <dig> that may play a role in the observed developmental anomalies. our results indicate that rfc1-/- embryos have alterations in the expression of several genes that code for receptors, ligands, interacting proteins, and modifiers of the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex. cubilin and megalin are both expressed in the vys and play a critical role in the maternal-fetal transport of multiple ligands. in the vys, blood vessels develop adjacent to the ve cell layer, and cell-cell interactions between yolk sac mesenchyme and ve appear to be important for vascular development  <cit> . cubilin and megalin are cell surface proteins expressed in the extraembryonic ve that work cooperatively to mediate endocytosis of lipoproteins and vitamin complexes  necessary for erythropoiesis and embryonic development. uptake of folate and nutrients by the ve may therefore play a role in development of the adjacent yolk sac mesenchyme necessary for formation of the allantois and the initiation of erythropoiesis. in the absence of rfc <dig>  the primary route of folate uptake into cells may be the gpi-anchored folate receptor, or internalization of folate bound to the soluble form of the folate receptor via endocytosis by megalin  <cit> .

although our rt-pcr results demonstrated no significant difference in message levels of megalin, a 10-fold increase in folr <dig> expression was detected in rfc1-/- relative to rfc+/+ littermates. ihc examination of megalin and folr <dig> protein expression in rfc1-/- embryos indicates the disappearance of megalin on the apical cell surface of the vys, as well as aberrant expression of folr <dig>  suggesting that, in addition to the absence of rfc1-mediated folate transport, folate uptake via the folr1-megalin transport pathway may also be compromised in the vys of rfc1-/- embryos.

microarray analysis and rt-pcr validation demonstrated highly significant upregulation of cubilinmessage in e <dig>  rfc1-/- embryos. follow-up ihc analysis suggested a corresponding upregulation in cubilin protein, although technical challenges associated with extracting sufficient amounts of protein from the tiny e <dig>  mutant embryos precluded western blot quantification. in rfc1+/+, cubilin protein is observed on the apical surface of neuroepithelial cells, while in mutant embryos, cubilin protein is observed predominantly on the basolateral side of the neuroepithelium. increased expression of cubilin protein is also widely visible throughout the heart and cranial mesenchyme in rfc1-/- embryos, and is particularly evident in the region surrounding the notochord. it is of interest to note that staining for cubilin remains high on the apical plasma membrane of the vys in rfc <dig> mutants, and the polarity of expression does not seem to be altered as it does in the neuroepithelium.

previous reports suggest that cubilin-mediated endocytosis requires the presence of megalin  <cit> . if this is the case, even though cubilin is highly expressed in the vys of rfc1-/- embryos, cubilin-mediated internalization of nutrients in the vys may be impaired in the absence of megalin, resulting in the observed accumulation of cubilin on the apical surface of the plasma membrane. defective endocytosis of the cubilin-megalin complex and the observed upregulation in gene expression of transferrin, transthyretin, retinol binding protein, and several of the apolipoproteins in rfc1-/- embryos may reflect a compensatory upregulation in genes encoding for these cubilin-megalin transported ligands, secondary to a perceived deficiency in these nutrients by the developing embryo.

the expression of amn was also significantly upregulated in rfc1-/- embryos.amn is expressed in the ve, and forms a tight complex with the n-terminal end of cubilin, providing the transmembrane domain necessary for membrane anchoring and endocytic trafficking of cubilin. amn is therefore an essential component of the cubilin receptor complex, facilitating the endocytosis/transcytosis of cubilin-bound ligands and nutrients that are absorbed from the maternal environment and transported to the developing embryo during gastrulation. similar to the rfc1-/-, embryonic development is arrested during gastrulation in amn mouse mutants  <cit> . amn knockout embryos appear abnormal during the early primitive streak stage , and then die between e <dig> –e <dig> . mutant embryos are smaller than wildtype littermates, and the embryonic ectoderm is underdeveloped  <cit> . depending on the genetic background of the amn mouse mutant, the amniotic membrane may be present  <cit>  or absent  <cit> . extra-embryonic structures derived from proximal streak mesoderm , and distal streak mesoderm  in amn mutants appear to develop normally, but embryos have impaired assembly of derivatives of the middle primitive streak, resulting in the absence of paraxial, intermediate and lateral plate mesoderm.

dab2
gene expression was upregulated in our microarray analysis of rfc1-/- embryos, but the difference was not statistically significant on rt-pcr analysis. dab <dig> is a cytosolic adapter protein expressed in the ve and vys. inactivation of murine dab <dig> results in disorganization of the ve layer, and early embryonic lethality prior to gastrulation  <cit> . embryos appear to develop normally when dab <dig> is conditionally deleted from only the embryo, indicating that dab <dig> expression in the ve is the essential component for progression of normal embryogenesis  <cit> . dab <dig> binds to a common sequence in the cytoplasmic tails of lipoprotein receptors  <cit> , and has been found in complexes with megalin in the kidney  <cit> , suggesting it may be involved in mediating the intracellular trafficking and/or endocytosis of megalin. the dab <dig> gene is alternatively spliced to produce two protein products  <cit> ; expression of the p <dig> isoform is essential for normal embryonic development and endocytosis of megalin in the ve  <cit> . in p <dig> dab <dig> mutants, megalin and cubilin accumulate at the apical plasma membrane surface, and little intracellular protein or co-localization with early endosome markers is observed. however, if the p <dig> isoform of dab <dig> is inactivated, approximately 50% of homozygotes die by e <dig> , and surviving mutants are small and developmentally delayed relative to wildtype littermates  <cit> . altered expression of myo <dig> was also detected in our microarray analysis of rfc1-/- embryos. both isoforms of dab <dig> bind and recruit myo <dig> to clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> , and function in clathrin-mediated endocytosis in polarized epithelial cells  <cit> .

receptor-associated protein 
is another component of the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex that demonstrated increased expression in rfc1-/- embryos on our microarray analysis, but did not show a statistically significant difference in the rt-pcr analysis. rap binds both megalin  <cit>  and cubilin  <cit> , and functions as a chaperone-like protein to promote proper folding and protect the ligand binding sites of newly processed low density lipoprotein receptor family proteins, preventing premature interaction of ligands with the receptors  <cit> . megalin binds to two separate sites on rap  <cit>  with high affinity, and the binding is calcium-dependent. rap resides predominantly in the endoplasmic reticulum where it binds and escorts megalin receptors to the golgi. dissociation of the complex occurs in late endosomes, triggered by the acidic ph of this compartment, and the subsequent protonation of exposed histidine residues on the surface of rap that modulate the binding/release of rap from megalin  <cit> . rap is subsequently delivered to lysosomes and degraded, while megalin is recycled to the cell surface  <cit> . rap deficiency is associated with a decrease in megalin expression and a change in subcellular distribution, causing an accumulation of megalin in intracellular compartments. homozygous rap-deficient mice are viable and appear phenotypically normal, although megalin expression in the liver and brain is significantly reduced  <cit> .

in the renal brush border, megalin has been shown to specifically bind nhe <dig>  <cit> , a na+/h+ ion exchanger that mediates the electroneutral exchange of intracellular h+ for extracellular na+ across plasma membranes. nhe <dig> plays a critical role in nacl homeostasis, and the maintenance of intracellular ph, and has also been shown to play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis and endosomal acidification  <cit> . in renal proximal tubule cells, nhe <dig> deficiency or inhibition reduces the relative cell surface expression of megalin, suggesting intracellular retention of megalin due to impaired trafficking/recycling of endosomes back to the plasma membrane  <cit> . on our microarray analysis, the gene expression profile of numerous ion channels was altered in rfc1-/-embryos . rfc <dig> functions not only in the cellular uptake of folate, but also as a facilitative anion exchanger, and its deletion may impact intracellular ph homeostasis. the association of rap with megalin is highly ph dependent. premature dissociation of the rap-megalin complex could result in misfolding, or early intracellular degradation of megalin along the secretory pathway, which might provide an alternative explanation for the disappearance of megalin protein on the surface of the vys and neuroepithelium in rfc <dig> mutants. the absence of cell surface expression of megalin would impact uptake of megalin binding ligands such as transthyretin, hemoglobin, retinol binding protein, apolipoproteins, and shh, and might also impact megalin-dependent endocytosis of the cubilin-binding ligands such as albumin, transferrin, and apolipoprotein a-i. this would result in not only in a folate deficiency, but would also significantly impact maternal-fetal delivery of numerous other nutrients and morphogens required for normal vasculogenesis, hematopoiesis and embryonic development.

CONCLUSIONS
rfc <dig> functions as a facilitative anion exchanger and the primary transporter of reduced folates in multiple tissue types. polymorphisms in folate transport genes have been implicated as risk factors for certain types of birth defects, and recent evidence from human epidemiological studies demonstrates an association between polymorphisms in rfc <dig> and increased risk for neural tube defects  <cit> , and conotruncal heart defects  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which altered rfc1-mediated folate transport perturb normal morphogenesis are currently unknown. in our knockout mouse model, loss of functional rfc <dig> during embryogenesis alters the gene expression of numerous transcription factors and ion channels, as well as the expression of a group of genes that code for receptors, ligands and interacting proteins in the cubilin-megalin multiligand endocytic receptor complex. alterations in the quantity and location of cubilin and megalin protein expression are observed in the yolk sac, neuroepithelium, and mesoderm of e <dig>  rfc <dig> nullizygous mutants. inactivation of cubilin, amnionless, or dab <dig> impacts early development, resulting in disorganization of the visceral endoderm, as well as deficiencies in the formation of mesodermal structures, including the chorioallantois, blood islands, and primitive erythrocytes, similar to the phenotype observed in rfc1-/- mutants on low dose maternal folate . inactivation of lrp <dig>  results in multiple malformations later in embryonic/fetal development that include neuroepithelial defects, and craniofacial and lung dysmorphologies similar to those observed in rfc1-/- mutants on high dose maternal folate . the spectrum of malformations observed in rfc <dig> knockout embryos may therefore be causally related to altered expression of the cubilin-amnionless-megalin complex which mediates the maternal-fetal transport of folate and other nutrients, lipids, and morphogens such as sonic hedgehog  and retinoids that play critical roles in normal embryogenesis.
