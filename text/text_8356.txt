BACKGROUND
normalization of gene expression data between different samples generated in the same laboratory using a single platform, and/or generated in different geographical regions using multiple platforms, is central to the establishment of a reliable reference database for toxicogenomics and pharmacogenomics. transforming expression data into a "per cell" database is an effective way of normalizing expression data across samples and platforms. however, transcriptome data from the quantitative pcr  and dna microarray analyses currently deposited in the database are related to a fixed amount of rna collected per sample. variations in rna yield across samples in an experimental series compromise accurate determination of the absolute level of each mrna species per cell in any sample. normalization against housekeeping genes for pcrs, and global normalization of ratiometric data for microarrays, is typically performed to account for this informational loss. additional methods, such as the use of external mrna spikes, reportedly improve the quality of data from microarray systems. for example, holstege et al.  <cit>  described a spike method against total rna, based on their finding that the yields of total rna from wild type and mutant cells were very similar. hill et al.  <cit>  reported a spike method against total rna for normalizing hybridization data such that the sensitivities of individual arrays could be compared. lee et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that "housekeeping genes" cannot be used as a reference control, and van de peppel et al.  <cit>  described a normalization method of mrna against total rna using an external spike mixture. to achieve satisfactory performance they used multiple graded doses of external spikes, covering a wide range of expression, in order to align the ratiometric data by lowess normalization  <cit> . hekstra et al.  <cit>  presented a method for calculating the final crna concentration in a hybridization solution. sterrenburg et al.  <cit>  and dudley et al.  <cit>  reported the use of common reference control samples for two-color microarray analyses of the human and yeast genomes, respectively. these are pools of antisense oligo sequences against all sense oligos present on the microarray. instead of antisense oligos, talaat et al.  <cit>  used genomic dna as a common reference control in studies of e. coli. statistical approaches have been proposed for ratiometric data to improve inter-microarray variations, especially of non-linear relations  <cit> . however, because control samples may differ among studies, ratiometric data cannot easily be compared across multiple studies unless a common reference, such as a mixture of all antisense counterparts of spotted sense sequences is used  <cit> . nevertheless, as long as the normalization is calibrated to total rna, variations in total rna profile cannot be effectively cancelled out. although some of these reports share the idea that "absolute expression" and "transcripts per cell" should entail robust normalization, further practical development to enable universal application has been awaited.

here, we report a method for normalizing expression data across samples and methods to the cell number of each sample, using the dna content as indicator. this normalization method is independent of the gene expression profile of the sample, and may contribute to transcriptome studies as a common standard for data comparison and interchange.

RESULTS
dose-response linearity of the measurement system as a basis for the percellome method
the fidelity of transcript detection is the key to this "per cell" based normalization method, which generates transcriptome data in "mrna copy numbers per cell". the q-pcr system was tested by serially diluting samples to confirm the linear relationship between ct values and the log of sample mrna concentration . high density oligonucleotide microarrays from affymetrix  <cit>  were used in our experiments. we tested the linearity of the affymetrix genechips using a set of five samples made of mixtures of liver and brain in ratios of 100: <dig>  75: <dig>  50: <dig>  25: <dig>  and 0: <dig> . the results showed a linear relationship  between fluorescence intensity and input for a sufficient proportion of probe sets, i.e. about 37% of the probe sets in the older mg-u74v <dig> and 70% in the newest mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  genechip were above the detection level  in the 50: <dig> sample  .

dose-response linearity alone is not sufficient to generate true mrna copy numbers. an important additional requirement is that the ratio of signal intensity to mrna copy number should be equal among all genechip probe sets of mrnas and pcr primers. the q-pcr primer sets were designed to perform at similar amplification rates to minimize differences between amplicons. the melting temperature was set between 60° and 65°c with a product size of approximately  <dig> base pairs using an algorithm , and the amplification co-efficiency  was set within the range  <dig>  ±  <dig>  }- <dig> on a plot of log <dig>  against ct value). for the genechip system, the signal/copy performance of each probe set depended on the strategy of designing the probes to keep the hybridization constant/melting temperature within a narrow range, ensuring that the dose-response performances of the probe sets were similar . failing this, any differences should at least be kept constant within the same make/version of the genechip. taking into consideration the biases that lead to imperfections in estimating absolute copy numbers in each gene/probe set, we developed normalization methods to set up a common scale for q-pcr and affymetrix genechip systems.

the grade-dosed spike cocktail  and the "spike factor" for the percellome method
a set of external spike mrnas was used to transfer the measurement of cell number in the sample  to transcriptome analysis. for the spikes, we utilized five bacillus subtilis mrnas that were left open for users in the affymetrix genechip series. the extent to which the bacillus rnas cross-hybridized with other probe sets was checked for the affymetrix genechip system. the gsc was applied to murine genome u74av <dig> array  genechips with or without a liver sample. as shown in figure  <dig>  cross-hybridization between bacillus rnas and the murine gene probe sets was negligible . mouse genome  <dig>  <dig>  array , mouse expression arrays 430a  and b , rat expression array 230a , xenopus laevis genome array and human genome u95av <dig>  and u133a  arrays sharing the same probe sets for these spike mrnas showed no sign of cross-hybridization with the bacillus probes .

we prepared a cocktail containing in vitro transcribed bacillus mrnas in threefold concentration steps, i.e.  <dig>  pm ,  <dig>  pm ,  <dig>  pm ,  <dig>  pm  and  <dig>  pm . by referring to the amount of dna in a diploid cell and employing a "spike factor" determined by the ratio of total rna to genomic dna in a tissue type , the spike mrnas were calculated to correspond to  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  copies per cell , respectively, for the mouse liver samples . the ratio of mrnas in the cocktail is empirically chosen depending on the linear range of the measurement system and the available number of spikes. here, we set the ratio to three to cover the "present" call probe sets of the affymetrix genechip system .

we tested this grade-dosed spike cocktail  by q-pcr and confirmed that the ct values of the spike mrnas were linearly related to the log concentrations , i.e. could be expressed as

ct = αlog c + β     {1}

the gsc was also tested by the genechip system and it was confirmed that the log of the spike mrna signal intensities was linearly related to the log of their concentrations ,

log s = γlog c + δ     {2}

the linear relationship between the ct values  and the log of rna concentration  was reasonable given the definition of ct values . the linear relationship between the log of genechip signal intensity  and the log of rna concentration  was rationalized by the near-normal distribution of log s over all transcripts .

calculation of copy numbers of all genes/probe sets per cell
as described above, using a combination of dna content and the spike factor of the sample, the gsc spike mrnas become direct indicators of the copy numbers  per cell. when the samples were measured by q-pcr or genechip analysis, the five gsc spike signals in each sample should obey function {1} for q-pcr and function {2} for genechip with a good linearity. if the observed linearity was poor, a series of quality controls was performed and the measurement repeated. the coefficients of the functions were determined for each sample by the least squares method. under the assumption that all genes/probe sets share the same signal/copy relationship, signal data for all genes/probe sets were fitted to the functions {1'} or {2'}, which are the individualized functions of {1} and {2} for each sample measurement .

ct = αi log + βi     {1'}

log  = γi log + δi    {2'}



the q-pcr ct values  and microarray signal values  of all mrna species in the sample  are converted to copy numbers per cell  by the inverses of functions {1'} and {2'}, i.e. {3} and {4} below:

c' = b^/αi)     {3}

for q-pcr .;

c' = b^/δi)     {4}

for genechips ,

where b is the logarithmic base used in {1} and {2} .

real world performance of the percellome method
the correspondence between q-pcr and genechip was tested using a sample set from  <dig> , <dig> -tetrachlorodibenzodioxin -treated mice. sixty male c57bl/ <dig> mice were divided into  <dig> groups of  <dig> mice each. tcdd was administered once orally at doses of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μg/kg, and the livers were sampled  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h after administration. nineteen primer pairs were prepared for q-pcr and the ct values of the liver transcriptome were measured. the same  <dig> liver samples were measured using the affymetrix mouse430- <dig> genechip . q-pcr and genechip data were normalized against cell number by functions {3} and {4}, respectively. the averages and standard deviations  of each group  were calculated and plotted as three layers of isoborograms on to  <dig> ×  <dig> matrix three-dimensional graphs . together with another sample set , a total of thirty-six primer pairs were compared, and there was a correlation of up to 90% between the q-pcr and genechip surfaces. it is notable that not only the average surfaces but also the +1sd and -1sd surfaces corresponded closely in shape and size. we infer that the differences resulted mainly from biological variations among the three animals in each experimental group rather than from measurement error .

an important feature of percellome normalization is its independence from the overall expression profile of the sample. when gene expression profiles differ among samples, percellome normalization produces a robust transcriptome that is different from total-rna dependent global normalization. as an example, figure  <dig> shows the results of an experiment on the uterotrophic response of ovariectomized mice to estrogen treatment  <cit>  . the uteri of the vehicle control are atrophic because the ovaries, the source of intrinsic estrogens, are absent. the uteri of the treated groups are hypertrophic owing to estrogenic stimulus from the test compound administered. global normalization  between the vehicle control group and the high-dose  group indicated that  <dig>  of  <dig>  probe sets showed 2-fold or greater increase,  <dig> were reduced by  <dig>  or less, and  <dig>  remained between these extremes. in contrast, analysis of percellome-normalized data revealed that almost all the  <dig>  probe sets showed a 2-fold or greater increase, including actin, gapdh and other housekeeping genes. the hypertrophic tissues, consisting of cells with abundant cytoplasm, provide convincing evidence for the increases in various cellular components including housekeeping gene products.

another important feature of percellome normalization is the commonality of the expression scale across platforms. batch conversion can be performed between results obtained from different platforms when the data are generated by the percellome method. a practical strategy for such normalization is to prepare a set of samples from a target organ of interest with differences in gene expression, and measure them once by each platform. data conversion functions with good linear dose-response relationships can be obtained individually for those genes/probe sets that are measured by both platforms .

discussion
we have developed a novel method for normalizing mrna expression values to sample cell numbers by adding external spike mrnas to the sample in proportion to the genomic dna concentration. for non-diploid or aneuploid samples, an average dna content per cell should be determined beforehand for accurate adjustment. when there is significant dna synthesis, a similar adjustment should be considered.

the smallest sample to which we have successfully applied the direct dna quantification method with sufficient reproducibility is the  <dig>  dpc  mouse embryo which consists of approximately  <dig>  cells. this sample size is also approximately the lower limit for double amplification protocol to obtain sufficient amount of rna for affymetrix genechip measurement  high-resolution technology such as laser-capture microdissection  has become popular and the average sample size analyzed is getting smaller. an alternative method for lcm samples is to count the cell number in the course of microdissection. although we have not yet applied percellome method to lcm samples, we have applied the alternative method to cell culture samples to gain percellome data. stereological and statistical calculations should become available to correct the number of partially sectioned cells in the lcm samples. another issue for small samples is the yield of rna. approximately  <dig> ng of total rna is retrieved from a single  <dig>  dpc mouse embryo. this amount is sufficient for a double amplification protocol  to prepare enough rna for an affymetrix genechip measurement. an inherent problem with the da data is that the gene expression profile differs from that of the default single amplification protocol . consequently the da percellome data differ from that of sa as if they were produced by a different platform. to bridge the difference, we applied the procedure that was used for data conversion between q-pcr and genechip . a set of spiked-in standard samples including the lbm sample set  were measured by the sa protocol and diluted versions to the limit measured by the da protocol. these data provided us with information about whether da was successful as a whole  and which probe sets were properly amplified by da . for those probe sets that proved to be linearly amplified, conversion functions between da and sa were generated. these details, along with embryo expression data will be published elsewhere.

figures  <dig> and  <dig> indicate a close correspondence between the data generated by q-pcr and genechip analyses. since each of the  <dig> samples was normalized individually against each gsc signal, the high similarity between the two platforms indicates the robustness and stability of this spike system . although more spikes could potentially increase the accuracy of normalization, our experience is that five spikes are practically sufficient for covering the detection range of genechip microarrays and q-pcr, as long as they are used in combination with the "spike factor". the overall benefits of using a minimum number of external spikes include lower probability of cross-hybridization, a reduced number of wells and spots occupied by the spikes in the q-pcr plates and small scale microarrays, and less effort in preparation, qc and supply.

the percellome data can be truly absolute when all mrna measurements including gsc spikes are strictly proportional to the original copy numbers in the sample homogenate. as noted earlier, this condition is not guaranteed by any platform despite linearity of response. therefore, the percellome-normalized values have some biases for each primer pair/probe set, depending on the steepness of the dose-response curves. an advantage of percellome normalization is that, as long as such biases are consistently reproduced within a platform, the data can be compared directly among samples/studies on a common scale. consequently, when a true value is obtained by any other measure, all the data obtained in the past can be simultaneously batch-converted to the true values.

this batch-conversion strategy can be extended to data conversion between different versions and different platforms, as long as the data are generated in copy numbers "per cell". we have shown an example between affymetrix genechip and q-pcr for limited numbers of probe sets . custom microarrays that accept our gsc for percellome normalization are in preparation by agilent technologies  and ge healthcare .

another important contribution of percellome analysis is in the area of archived data in private and public domains. firstly, percellome data are the result of a simple linear transformation of the raw microarray data; preserving the distribution and order of the probe set data. therefore, parametric or non-parametric methods should be able to align the data distribution and generate estimates of mrna copy number of the non-spiked archival samples. any archival samples that are re-measurable by percellome method will greatly increase the accuracy of estimation. secondly, percellome can provide appropriate bridging information between old and new versions of affymetrix genechips, such as human hu- <dig> and hu- <dig>  murine mu-74v <dig> and moe <dig> series. this should also facilitate comparisons between newly generated and archived data.

the percellome method was developed for a large-scale toxicogenomics project  <cit>  using the affymetrix genechip system. it was intended to compile a very large-scale database of comprehensive gene expression profiles in response to various chemicals from a series of experiments conducted over an extended time period. however, the method also proved to be useful for small-scale platforms such as  <dig> well plate-based q-pcrs as shown above, and probably for small-scale targeted microarrays. in both cases, highly inducible or highly transcribed genes are likely to be selected. therefore, the expression profiles may differ significantly among samples such that profile-dependent normalization  may not be applicable. in such cases, the profile-independent nature of the percellome method provides a robust normalization.

to demonstrate the profile-independence of the percellome method, we chose an extreme case – the uterotrophic response assay . the treated uteri were composed of hypertrophic cells with abundant cytoplasm whereas the untreated uteri were composed of hypoplastic cells with scant cytoplasm. this indicates that the uteri of untreated ovariectomized mice were quiescent, and that a majority of the inducible genes were probably transcriptionally inactive. therefore, the identification of most genes as being induced by 2-fold or greater is reasonable and expected. in most in vivo experiments, the gene profiles of the samples are much more similar. however, there is always a set of genes that is found to be "increased" when analyzed on a "per one cell" basis that are declared to be "decreased" by global type normalization, or vice versa. such increase/decrease calls made by the global type normalization can differ according to the normalization parameters. in both cases, the percellome method can inform the researcher how much the expression profiles are distorted by the treatment, such as in the case of the uterotrophic assay. we also note that in vitro experiments such as cell-based studies tend to generate data similar to that of uterotrophic experiment.

CONCLUSIONS
percellome data can be compared directly among samples and among different studies, and between different platforms, without further normalization. therefore, "percellome" normalization can serve as a standard method for exchanging and comparing data across different platforms and among different laboratories. we hope that the percellome method will contribute to transcriptome-based studies by facilitating data exchanges among laboratories.
