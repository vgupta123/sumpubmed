BACKGROUND
the lepidoptera, comprising the moths and butterflies  <cit> , represent the second largest lineage of plant-feeding organisms and among all insect orders they seem to have radiated most recently  <cit> . moths, including 95% of the extant lepidopteran species have evolved an efficient mate-communication system based on volatile sex pheromones produced by females. the vast majority of the higher lepidoptera -the so-called ditrysia - uses unique blends of long-chain unsaturated alcohols, acetates or aldehydes in order to attract conspecific males over long distances  <cit> . these pheromones are produced in specialized pheromone glands located along the intersegmental membrane between the terminal abdominal segments viii and ix  <cit> . these pheromone compounds are biosynthesized from saturated fatty-acid precursors along pathways involving a few discrete enzymatic reactions including the introduction of double bonds by specific desaturases, limited chain-shortening reactions and the formation of an oxygenated functional group .

an important step in insect pheromone biosynthesis is the involvement of specific desaturases introducing double bonds at specific positions in the fatty-acyl chain by removing two hydrogen atoms  <cit> . insect desaturases are homologous to the ancestral Δ <dig> acyl-coa desaturases of plants, vertebrates and fungi and are functioning as part of a multienzyme complex residing in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . certain moth desaturase lineages are believed to have arisen subsequently to the divergence of lepidoptera and diptera that took place around  <dig> million years ago   <cit>  and may have played a significant role in the evolution of sex-pheromones in lepidoptera. interestingly, the biosynthesis of many ditrysian oxygenated pheromones proceeds with various Δ11-desaturation reactions  <cit> . up to this date desaturase-encoding genes have been investigated in a dozen ditrysian moths, depicting examples of elaborate evolution in which a minimal number of enzymes account for the chemical diversity and species-specificity of pheromone components found among different species  <cit> .

only a few primitive moth species have so far been investigated considering their chemical communication. their pheromones are made of short-chain alcohols and ketones and release through sternal globular glands whose openings are located on the vth abdominal segment  <cit> . the modern distal female abdominal gland and the typical ditrysian calling postures likely arose prior to divergence of the ditrysia as a few examples are known in some monotrysian heteroneura . however, the exact localization of distal gland producing-pheromone in non-ditrysian heteroneura remains to be determined. likewise, the origin of the ditrysian sex-pheromone, i.e., the emergence of mating-signals derived from saturated long-chain fatty acids and involving genes  specific for pheromone production, remains obscure although it has been suggested to originate in a moth lineage prior to the divergence of ditrysia and the other heteroneura lineages  <cit>  . recently, long-chain unsaturated pheromone components were identified from the abdominal tip in a moth species outside the ditrysia; the sex pheromone of the currant shoot borer, lampronia capitella , was characterized as a mixture of - <dig> -tetradecadienol, and the corresponding acetate and aldehyde  <cit> . this monotrysian species constitutes the most primitive moth for which long-chain unsaturated pheromone components have been evidenced and provides a unique opening for investigating evolutionary aspects of the ditrysian pheromone mating-signals.

in this study we report on pheromone-gland precursor identification, molecular characterization and functional expression of desaturase transcripts from the pheromone gland of l. capitella, of which a functional Δ11-desaturase transcript that exhibits all of the required biochemical activities to biosynthesize the conjugated chemical structures of the major sex pheromone component. our findings evidence that the novel desaturase lineages,  and Δ11) evolved before the split between the ditrysian and other heteroneuran moth lineages. by extension, our findings suggest that the specific biosynthetic functions inherited from early moth history and which contributed to structural variations in mating-signals may have played a role in the radiation of the higher lepidoptera.

RESULTS
fatty-acid pheromone precursor identification
methanolyzed samples of abdominal tips from l. capitella were prepared and analysed by gc-ms. in addition to the saturated fatty-acid methyl esters from c <dig> to c <dig> and the common unsaturated esters z9–18:me; z <dig> z12–18:me; z <dig> z <dig> z15–18:me and z9–16:me, the esters identified also included z9–14:me, z11–14:me, e11–14:me, z11–16:me and a methyl tetradecadienoate . z9–12:me was not detected either in fame- or in dmds-adduct analyses. monounsaturated methyl esters exhibited the expected diagnostic ions at m/z  <dig>  m+, m+ - <dig>  m+ - <dig>  m+- <dig>  at expected retention times. gc-ms analyses of dmds derivatives of a methanolyzed sample confirmed the identification of z9-monoenes by detection of the characteristic ion at m/z  <dig> at expected retention times . dmds adducts of the z11–16:me, z11–14:me and e11–14:me exhibited the characteristic ion at m/z  <dig> as shown in fig.  <dig> 

the double-bond positions of the methyl tetradecadienoate were identified as  <dig>  by analysis of its mtad derivatives that exhibited the diagnostic ions at m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  the presence of a methyl  <dig> -hexadecadienoate was also found , exhibiting diagnostic mtad adducts at m/z  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  which can be rationalised to be formed by chain-elongation of the relatively abundant z <dig> z11–14:acyl.

when the glands were incubated with d9-z11–16:acid for  <dig> hours in vivo, the label was incorporated into z9–14:me , a potential intermediate in pheromone biosynthesis, thereby indicating that z9–14:acyl could be produced by β-oxidation of z11–16:acyl.

characterization of desaturase transcripts
total rna was isolated from female abdominal tips of l. capitella. in pcr reactions using the corresponding cdna as template and primers targeting conserved desaturase motifs  <cit> , 550-bp dna fragments were amplified that encompassed the central region of a desaturase gene. from the dna information provided by the central region, four distinct transcripts were identified and their full-length cdna sequences subsequently cloned.

the first desaturase transcript, lca-qpaq spans  <dig>  bp and encompasses an orf encoding a protein of  <dig> aa residues, which shares high aa sequence similarity with known z9-desaturases , e.g., 81% with the z9-desaturase from choristoneura parallela  and 80% with the z9-desaturase from epiphyas postvittana .

the second desaturase transcript, lca-spve spans  <dig>  bp and contains an orf encoding a 352-aa residue protein. this deduced protein shows 64% sequence similarity to lca-qpaq but higher similarity to other z9-desaturases , e.g., 77% aa-sequence similarity to the z9-desaturase from trichoplusia ni  and 76% to the z9-desaturase from spodoptera littoralis .

the third desaturase transcript, lca-gatd spans  <dig>  bp and encompasses an orf encoding a 380-aa residue protein, which displays 51% sequence similarity to both lca-qpaq and lca-spve and even higher similarity  to the z9-desaturase  from c. parallela .

the fourth desaturase transcript, lca-kpvq, spans  <dig>  bp and encompasses and orf encoding a 360-aa residue protein. the deduced aa sequence shows 58%, 54% and 46% similarity to lca-qpaq, lca-spve and lca-gatd, respectively and shows between 60–65% similarity to various 11-insect desaturases .

functional assay of Δ9-desaturases by complementation in mutant yeast using the expression vector yepolex
a desaturase-deficient yeast cell line  was transformed with yepolex plasmids containing the lca-qpaq, lca-spve or lca-gatd orf, respectively. yepolex-lca-qpaq transformants were able to grow on medium lacking supplemental unsaturated fatty-acids , indicating that the lca-qpaq cdna was encoding a desaturase that complemented the ufa auxotrophic ole <dig> strain. in contrast, yepolex-lca-spve and yepolex-lca-gatd transformants were unable to grow on media lacking ufas. these results were confirmed using distinct verified gene constructs under identical experimental conditions. chromatograms of methylated fatty-acid extracts from the lca-qpaq transformants showed three peaks with retention times corresponding to z9–14:me, z9–16:me and z9–18:me, in a 2:62: <dig> ratio. fatty-acid methyl esters from yeast transformed with the z9-desaturase gene of h. assulta  were also prepared for use as a positive control. in this case the transformation resulted in the production of z9–16:me and z9–18:me, with a preference for palmitic acid, as shown in gc-ms analyses . thus lca-qpaq and hass-kpse are encoding z9-desaturases displaying a substrate preference for palmitic acid, which is consistent as these desaturases are phylogenetically closely related  . double-bond position in the reaction products was confirmed by analyses of dmds derivatives, which exhibited the characteristic fragment at m/z  <dig> at expected retention times . no distinctive products were detected in fame or mtad analyses after incubation of yeasts transformed with any of the yepolex-lca-constructs in the presence of z11–14:me.

functional assay of a Δ11-desaturase by complementation in mutant yeast using the expression vector pyex-cht
since the lca-kpvq transcript could not be expressed in the pyes <dig>  system  neither in the invsc <dig> nor in the ole <dig> yeast strains, the lca-kpvq orf was ligated into a copper-inducible pyex expression vector  <cit>  to assess its desaturase activity and then transformed into a desaturase- and elongase-deficient mutant ole <dig> elo <dig> yeast strain  <cit> . gc-ms analyses of fatty-acid methyl esters from a recombinant yeast cell line grown in presence of cu2+ showed that the encoded protein produced a broad range of monounsaturated products. transformed cells produced z11–14:me, z11–16:me, z11–18:me and z11–20:me in a 1:48:36: <dig> ratio. gc-ms analyses of dmds derivatives prepared from the yeast transformants exhibited the characteristic fragment for a double-bond position between c11-c <dig> at m/z  <dig> . all monoene products showed z <dig> stereospecifity and no e <dig> isomers were found among dmds derivatives. besides z11-monounsaturated acid products, cells supplemented with z9–14:me had produced a conjugated c <dig> dienoate as further confirmed by analyses of mtad derivatives . gc-ms analyses of mtad-derivatized samples, corroborated by injection of mtad-derivatized synthetic standards, showed that both cis and trans mtad adducts were produced by lca-kpvq yeast transformants. the two c14-mtad adducts displayed identical diagnostic ions at m/z  <dig> , m/z  <dig> and m/z  <dig>  and different retention times  . the presence of a cis adduct indicated that yeast cells supplemented with z9–14:me and transformed with lca-kpvq produced the - <dig> -tetradecadienoate. the trans adduct can be produced from both z,z and z,e dienes  <cit> , which does not allow to preclude the production of the z,e diene. conjugated  <dig> -dienes  that were also detected in analyses of mtad-derivatives  are an artefact of the mtad reaction that takes place upon derivatization of 9-monoenes  .

discussion
desaturases as key factor for pheromone evolution
there is no single explanation for the evolutionary and ecological success of lepidoptera but it is rather thought to be the result of a cascade of successful evolutionary innovations  <cit> . the recruitment of certain lineages of desaturase genes to serve in pheromone biosynthesis might be one of these innovations that have played a significant role in the evolution of lepidoptera, setting the scene for the development of a very effective mate-communication system  <cit> . the radiation of the lepidoptera took off about  <dig> mya, approximately at the time when the ditrysia diverged from other heteroneuran lepidoptera  <cit> . this evolutionary event appears to coincide with the emergence of a novel pheromone communication system, characterized by the involvement of novel desaturases in the production of long-chain unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives as pheromone components. in particular, Δ11-desaturases contributed significantly to the biosynthesis of a broad range of unsaturated pheromone components in ditrysian species and strongly increased the structural diversity of pheromone precursors  <cit> . in this study we demonstrate the involvement of a Δ11-desaturase in the pheromone biosynthesis in a non-ditrysian moth, lampronia capitella , which strongly supports the interpretation that the recruitment of the specialized desaturases to serve in the production of moth pheromone components occurred in the early evolution of lepidoptera, before their extensive radiation.

involvement of a Δ11-desaturase gene in mate signalling in the primitive monotrysian moth l. capitella
we explored the potential pathways leading to the production of z <dig> z11–14:oh and the corresponding aldehyde and acetate, which are known pheromone components in l. capitella . the absence of z9–12:acyl excluded the possibility of having two successive interactions of a Δ9-desaturase in the pheromone biosynthesis and the observed fatty-acid profile was found compatible with all three hypothetical pathways shown in fig.  <dig>  due to the occurrence of relatively large amounts of z11–16:acyl in the gland and the confirmed possible chain-shortening of this intermediate to z9–14:acyl, a scenario was eligible  that involves Δ11-desaturation of palmitic acid as an initial step in pheromone biosynthesis then followed by Δ11-desaturation of z9–14:acyl.

four full-length desaturase encoding cdnas were characterized from the l. capitella abdominal tip and their deduced amino acid sequences notably revealed the three histidine-rich motifs  that are characteristic of membrane-bound desaturases  <cit> . the lca-qpaq, lca-spve and lca-gatd transcripts shared high homologies with known Δ9-desaturases while the fourth transcript  showed a high amino acid sequence similarity with several Δ <dig>  Δ <dig> and bifunctional desaturases from ditrysian moth species. sequence analysis evidenced that the isolated transcript represented a typical fatty-acyl desaturase gene. its predicted primary protein structure  shared several key features with other known insect desaturases, like the position and the length of the transmembrane domains relative to the conserved his boxes and the xxxq signature motif according to a desaturase-nomenclature previously proposed  <cit> . a reconstruction of the evolutionary history of desaturase genes  finally indicated this candidate desaturase to cluster with members of the Δ11-desaturase lineage.

functional characterization of the lca-kpvq gene product in a desaturase- and elongase-deficient yeast strain was performed and analyses of the unsaturated fatty-acid profiles of pyex-lca-kpvq-expressing transformants established that the gene product displayed a z11-desaturase activity with relatively broad substrate specificity. saturated substrates from c <dig> to c <dig> occur naturally in the ole  <dig> elo <dig> yeast strain and the gene-product catalysed the removal of two hydrogen atoms from c <dig>  c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  with a strong substrate preference for palmitic acid  as shown in fig. 5a. this enzyme is also the first insect Δ11-desaturase reported to act on the c20:acyl substrate. after complete gc-ms analysis of both yeast methanolyzed extracts and their dmds derivatives, the z configuration of the double bond was confirmed in all newly formed unsaturated substrates and no e isomers were detected. two Δ11-desaturases  were characterized that produced z-isomers of c <dig> and c <dig> acyl precursors in addition to z and e isomers of c <dig> acyl precursors that were later converted into the active pheromone compounds  <cit> . though trans-unsaturated pheromone components are not utilized by l. capitella, minor amounts of e11–14:me were detected in dmds analyses of fames from female abdominal tips. this was not confirmed in vitro, which might be due to the limits of detection and does not alter the above evidences of an active Δ11-gene.

after supplementation with excess of z9–14:me, the yeast produced small amounts of the conjugated z <dig> z11-tetradecadienoate, which was detected upon gc-ms analyses of the cis mtad-adduct . in presence of large amounts of both pheromone biosynthetic intermediates , the lca-kpvq transcript always preferentially catalyzed the formation of the z11–16:acyl monounsaturated intermediate.

Δ9-stearyl-coa desaturases are primordial enzymes regulating the level of unsaturated fatty-acid biosynthesis and thereby allowing living organisms to maintain the physical structure and fluidity of membrane lipid bilayers  <cit> . when transforming yeasts with yepolex-lca-spve or yepolex-lca-gatd constructs, the Δ <dig> desaturase activity of the ole <dig> yeast strain could not be restored. Δ9-desaturases  exist that catalyse the formation of z9-monoenes in the pheromone gland of some ditrysian moth species  <cit> ; although in most cases pheromone biosynthesis does not involve Δ <dig> desaturation  <cit> . it is also not uncommon to encounter inactive desaturase transcripts as exemplified by two lca-gatd paralogs, the hassgatd transcript that was found to be non-functional in pheromone biosynthesis in h. assulta  <cit>  or the cpaz9gatd  transcript that produced a long series of monounsaturated fatty acids in c. parallela, an activity that could however not be linked to sex-pheromone biosynthesis  <cit> . it might then be envisioned that both lca-spve and lca-gatd are catalytically inactive desaturases in this moth species and as previously suggested, could represent pseudogenes or encode other functions yet to be determined  <cit> . analyses of esterified total-lipid extracts of yepolex-lca-qpaq-transformed yeast revealed that the gene product was producing a series of z9-monoenes with a preference for palmitic acid like other Δ <dig> 16c>18c insect-desaturases . the z9–14:acyl, intermediate in the pheromone biosynthesis , accounted for 2% of the total amount of ufas produced and could thus be formed by the lca-z9-qpaq desaturase. however, topical application of labelled precursors indicated that the d9-z11–16:acyl is also significantly incorporated into z9–14:acyl. knowing that the z11–16:acyl is produced by Δ11-desaturation and that significant chain-shortening occurs in the gland, it is more likely that the z9–14:acyl derives from β-oxidation of the z11–16:acyl precursor. the lca-z9-qpaq desaturase is most likely not involved in the pathway b of pheromone production. besides, no conjugated z <dig> z11–14:acyl could be detected from lca-z9-qpaq yeasts transformants grown in presence of z11–14:me and this transcript is therefore not involved in the Δ9-desaturation reaction proposed in the pathway c .

in conclusion, our in vitro analyses indicate that the lca-z11-kpvq transcript encodes a functional protein displaying enzymatic properties consistent with the proposed pheromone biosynthetic pathway of l. capitella . while the first z11-desaturation step on palmitic acid is a prevalent reaction that has been characterized in several other ditrysian moth species , the Δ11-desaturase activity on monoene precursors has been evidenced in only a few moth species up to date. in e. postvittana, an e11-desaturase catalyses the formation of e <dig> e11–14:acid from e9–14:acid  <cit>  while in b. mori, manduca sexta and s. littoralis bifunctional Δ <dig> and Δ <dig> -desaturases catalyse the formation of conjugated Δ <dig>  dienes from z11-monounsaturated precursors  <cit> .

insights into the origin of the Δ11-desaturase subfamily
any gene in any genome is selectively constrained and most mutations that change the fitness of an organism are expected to be deleterious  <cit> . gene duplications represent major opportunities that contribute to functional novelties in all living organisms thereby playing a vital role during evolution  <cit>  and the predominant motive during the evolution of a novel gene function is to gain a selective advantage  <cit> . the need for efficient mate signalling and species-specific recognition might have been a strong motive for establishment of new functions within pheromone communication as derived from duplicated genes. the pheromone-desaturase family most likely originated in a common ancestor of diptera and lepidoptera before their divergence in the early carboniferous, i.e., between  <dig> and  <dig> mya  <cit> . several extant flies hence use orthologs of the Δ <dig>  group -which represents the metabolic ancestral function of the gene family  <cit> - for synthesizing cuticular-hydrocarbon sex-pheromones  <cit> . subsequently the lepidopteran desaturase gene family evolved under a birth-and-death evolutionary process and underwent several duplication events leading to five well-supported clades  <cit>  . reconstructing the evolutionary history of desaturase genes shows that only the Δ <dig> and the Δ <dig>  lineages have no orthologous genes in any dipteran genome examined to date , which suggests that the genes were either lost in diptera subsequent to the divergence of moths and flies or that both lineages may have been recruited following a duplication point succeeding the divergence between diptera and lepidoptera  <cit> . we have examined the evolution of desaturases using predicted genes available from other insect orders including hymenoptera, hemiptera and coleoptera  and we found no evidence for orthologous genes of the Δ <dig> and Δ <dig>  in these insect orders. both desaturase lineages are thus most likely innovations of lepidopterans, of which the Δ11-desaturase lineage exclusively serves in the pheromone production. our molecular and functional investigations of pheromone biosynthetic genes in l. capitella strongly indicate that the duplication events that gave rise to both desaturase-gene lineages took place before the divergence of heteroneura lineages from ditrysia, around  <dig> mya. the alternative explanation that both duplications occurred independently in two different lineages is a less parsimonious explanation.

clearly, the emergence and establishment of the Δ11-desaturase subfamily in moth genomes might have promoted structural diversity among pheromones early in the evolution of lepidoptera. whether the duplication events took place before or after the divergence of lepidoptera and its sister group trichoptera will be interesting to investigate. in this context it would be of interest to find out whether Δ9- or Δ11-desaturases  underlie the double-bond formation in the biosynthesis of -4-hepten-2-ol and -6-nonen-2-ol  as observed in eriocraniidae moths and in trichoptera. both compounds could hypothetically be produced by Δ11-desaturation of tetradecanoate, followed by chain shortening by successive steps of β-oxidation and finally decarboxylation  <cit> . investigating pheromone biosynthesis in these more primitive non-ditrysian moth lineages will further highlight to what extent the recruitment of discrete pheromone production genes contributed to the emergence of the typical ditrysian moth signalling chemistry and by extension promoted the adaptive success of the lepidoptera.

likewise, the exact location of the distal pheromone-producing cells and their morphological features in monotrysia should also be investigated. such an investigation could resolve the intriguing issue whether the pheromone-producing desaturases in monotrysian moths are catalysing the formation of biosynthetic precursors in a pheromone gland structure alike those of most ditrysian species or within -a yet uncharacterized internal structure- of the abdominal tip.

CONCLUSIONS
the renowned sexual communication of lepidoptera has likely evolved through a combination of mechanisms  <cit>  involving the diversification of female-produced chemical signals that mediate mate attraction and corresponding changes in male responses to these signals  <cit> . variation in pheromone-biosynthetic genes have been supported for promoting changes in the emitted signals thereby indirectly directing major adaptations in moth mate-recognition systems  <cit> . a core component of the evolution of moth chemistry has been evidenced that imply gene duplications of biosynthetic genes and their maintenance in the insect genomes  <cit> . we here brought evidence that lepidoptera-specific pheromone-production desaturase genes evolved before radiation of the ditrysian lineages. especially, a Δ11-desaturase  was shown catalyzing key reactions leading to mono- and di-unsaturated fatty acyl-moieties in the primitive moth lampronia capitella, the sole non-ditrysian species identified to date that relies on long-chain di-unsaturated fatty-acid derivatives for mate-attraction. like many other characterized ditrysian-moth desaturases, lca-kpvq catalyses a few more desaturation reactions in vitro than those leading to the biologically relevant components used by l. capitella. this supports the current view that subtle alterations in enzymatic activities at different levels in the biosynthesis may have lead to subtle shifts in pheromones and ultimately to new species-specific communication channels  <cit> . recruiting Δ11-desaturases in mate signalling prior to the extensive lepidopteran radiation may thus have contributed, as part of a complex biological framework, to the evolution of the typical moth pheromone chemistry and supports the hypothesis that a limited number of biosynthetic genes played a pivotal role in ditrysian moth evolution.
