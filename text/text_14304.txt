BACKGROUND
correct regulation of gene expression is crucial for survival, and therefore organisms evolved elaborate mechanisms to regulate transcription through repression  <cit> . one of these mechanisms involves ubiquitination of histone h2a , mediated by the polycomb repressive complex  <dig>   <cit> . h2aub ultimately leads to chromatin compaction  <cit>  and is especially important during development by making critical genes inaccessible for transcription. prc <dig> is recruited to its target loci by binding the histone modification h3k27me <dig>  a product of prc <dig>  or by an alternative, prc2-independent mechanisms that are not completely known  <cit> .

prc <dig> in drosophila melanogaster, which is a model organism for chromatin research, consists of four core components: polyhomeotic , polycomb , dring and posterior sex combs   <cit> . mammals have multiple paralogs of the core components. in contrast, plants have been long thought to lack prc <dig>  the absence of prc <dig> in plants seemed an obvious conclusion as an initial screen of arabidopsis thaliana histone modifications failed to find a ubiquitinated h2a residue  <cit> , a hallmark of prc <dig>  and because orthologs of crucial prc <dig> subunits were initially not detected in a. thaliana or other plant genomes  <cit> .

gradually, the composition of the plant prc <dig> was pieced together and prc <dig> was shown to have a biological function. the plant prc <dig> is currently thought to contain five subunits  <cit> . the ring finger proteins ring1a-b and bmi1a-c are orthologs of d. melanogaster dring and psc, respectively. they have ubiquitination activity  <cit>  and interact with terminal flower 2/like heterochromatin protein  <dig>   <cit>  that functionally replaces the role of pc in h3k27me <dig> binding  <cit> . the d. melanogaster prc <dig> subunit ph has no orthologs in plants. the remaining two prc <dig> subunits are plant-specific proteins. embryonic flower  <dig>  is a poorly conserved protein with few conserved motifs and no annotated domains  <cit> . it interacts with ring1a-b and bmi1a-c and is an indispensible component for h2a ubiquitination activity  <cit> . vernalization  <dig> , the second plant-specific protein, is involved in vernalization  <cit> . as depletion of vrn <dig> causes a phenotype that is similar to other prc <dig> mutants, vrn <dig> was proposed to be the fifth subunit of the complex  <cit> . its function however is unknown, and no interactions with other prc <dig> subunits have been discovered to date. accordingly, some authors do not consider it a core subunit of this complex  <cit> .

mutants in prc <dig> subunits show severe and pleiotropic abnormalities. for example, tissues of ring1a/ring1b double mutants dedifferentiate into callus  <cit> , and emf <dig> mutants develop incomplete flowers immediately upon germination  <cit> . lhp <dig> is involved in vernalization  <cit> , and lhp <dig> mutants are smaller, have small curled leaves and flower early  <cit> . prc <dig> is thus important for maintaining cell identity and controlling developmental transitions.

in comparison to animals, prc <dig> in plants is still enigmatic  <cit> . while some orthologs of animal subunits were found and there is evidence for interactions between certain subunits, the biochemical evidence for existence of a prc <dig> complex in plants is still sparse. it also remains to be investigated how the prc <dig> subunits evolved in plants. due to its important role in development, the time of its emergence has been and will be used to derive implications for its function  <cit> . however, the current literature disagrees on when all prc <dig> subunits emerged. while mosses were first identified as the earliest branching plants with lhp <dig> and ring <dig>  <cit> , more recently prc <dig> was suggested to be much younger: both lhp <dig> and ring <dig> were found only in angiosperms, and emf <dig> and vrn <dig> only in eudicots  <cit> . in this paper we are able to resolve these discrepancies by using more sensitive phylogenetic methods. moreover, the availability of many recently published genomes and transcriptomes from previously neglected taxonomic groups enabled us to expand the inquiry into the phylogenetic distribution of prc <dig> subunits by including gymnosperms and monilophytes. our results demonstrate that prc <dig> subunits appear in more early diverging plants than previously thought: ring <dig> orthologs in chlorophytes, lhp <dig> and bmi <dig> orthologs in mosses, lycophytes and monilophytes, and emf <dig> orthologs in gymnosperms. thus, all core subunits of prc <dig> were already present in the ancestor of seed plants. the putative interacting protein vrn <dig> was a eudicot-specific invention that emerged in a relatively recent gene duplication. moreover, plant prc <dig> subunits underwent several rounds of duplications. surprisingly, we uncovered three so far unrecognized paralogs of emf <dig> stemming from two duplications before the gymnosperm-angiosperm split. we also resolved the duplication-rich history of other prc <dig> subunits that has important consequence for inferring function of orthologs in non-brassicaceae species. lastly, we point out conserved motifs in some of the proteins that might have functions related to prc <dig> complex and are therefore candidates for experimental inquiry to elucidate plant-specific molecular biology of this important protein complex.

RESULTS
to unravel the history of the plant prc <dig> complex, we performed sensitive similarity searches and subsequently inferred phylogenetic trees for its subunits. this allowed us to determine the time of duplications and losses as well as the time of inventions for plant-specific proteins. we used  <dig> plant genomes, covering all major plant groups . among others, we use genomes of seven chlorophytes, and a gymnosperm. genomes of early diverging plants are especially important in order to determine the time of invention as prc <dig> was suggested to be already established by the time of angiosperm divergence  <cit> . we also used the recently published genome of the basal angiosperm amborella trichopoda, as well as  <dig> monocot and  <dig> eudicot genomes. in addition, animal, fungal and sar  genomes were used as outgroups for proteins that already existed at the last common ancestor of eukaryotes . to supplement the missing or underrepresented plant groups we added gymnosperm and monilophyte sequences from transcriptome projects whenever applicable. due to recently finished genome and transcriptome sequencing projects, this paper is the first to also include monilophytes and gymnosperms to elucidate the evolutionary history of prc <dig> 

lhp <dig> is present in all multicellular plant lineages
lhp <dig> was first described as a plant homolog of d. melanogaster heterochromatin protein  <dig>   <cit> . while hp <dig> and its animal and fungal orthologs bind the histone modification h3k9me <dig>  <cit> , lhp <dig> binds h3k27me <dig>  <cit> . we identified orthologs of lhp <dig> in animals, fungi and sar , consistent with its presence in leca. the plant lhp <dig> sequences cluster in a single orthologous group. the phylogenetic distribution of lhp <dig> includes all land plants . this is a much wider distribution than just the angiosperm group reported recently  <cit>  and in agreement with the work of hennig et al.  <cit> . all seven chlorophyte genomes lack lhp <dig> orthologs. this likely represents a secondary loss as our methods are sufficiently sensitive to easily recover orthologs in other eukaryotic supergroups. using transcriptome data we show that lhp <dig> is also present in gymnosperms and monilophytes. in angiosperms, lhp <dig> is mostly a single-copy gene, and only genomes of species with relatively recent whole genome duplications  often harbor several  lhp <dig> orthologs. this is also the case in brassicaceae: there is one copy of lhp <dig> in the genomes of a. thaliana, arabidopsis lyrata, capsella rubella and thellungiella halophila. the three copies in brassica rapa suggest that the paralogs are derived from the b. rapa-specific whole-genome triplication.figure  <dig>

lhp <dig> is characterized by a unique combination of an n-terminal chromo domain and a c-terminal chromoshadow domain  <cit> . the chromo domain in a. thaliana lhp <dig> binds h3k27me <dig> in vivo  <cit>  whereas the chromoshadow domain  <cit>  is involved in dimerization  <cit> . plant lhp <dig> sequences contain an additional  <dig> amino acid region between chromo and chromoshadow domain compared to their animal orthologs . the chromoshadow domain alone was shown to be sufficient for dimerization in a. thaliana  <cit>  so this middle region likely functions in another process, perhaps mediating interactions with other proteins. next to several low-complexity sections it also contains two conserved motifs . all plant lhp <dig> orthologs contain the second motif , and the first  is clearly present only in eudicots . a shorter part of the second motif  corresponds to a potential substrate for pka-type agc kinase according to the eukaryotic linear motif database   <cit> . however, there is no evidence that this motif is phosphorylated  <cit> , and the putative phosphorylation site  is not conserved in lycophytes, monilophytes and mosses. as the conserved motif is longer than only the putative phosphorylation motif, it is very likely to have a different or additional function. for example, two different nuclear localization signals  also match the second motif, one of which was already described  <cit> . however since these nlss also cover only a small part of the conserved motif, the function is likely to extend beyond a nls or a phosphorylation motif.

ring1a-b paralogs from pre-eudicot duplication were lost in the ancestor of brassicaceae
ring <dig> and its orthologs in other eukaryotic supergroups consist of a ring finger domain, followed by a rawul domain. it originated before leca  <cit> . in plants, the phylogenetic distribution of ring <dig> proteins is somewhat controversial: they were found both in angiosperms and mosses  <cit>  or described as angiosperm-specific  <cit> . the gene tree of ring <dig> proteins  shows not only that that both moss and angiosperm genomes harbor ring <dig> orthologs but also that already gymnosperm, monilophyte, lycophyte and chlorophyte genomes encode full-length ring <dig> orthologs. a. trichopoda, the basal angiosperm, contains a single copy. ring <dig> underwent two duplications in the monocot  ancestor, and subsequently underwent more species-specific duplications as well as losses.figure  <dig> 
schematic gene trees of ring <dig>  and bmi <dig> . red squares show gene duplications. a. thaliana genes are denoted in blue letters. brassicaceae are depicted in detail; inferred gene losses are shown with gray dashed line. black dashed line: loss of one of the domains.



interestingly, the ring <dig> gene was also duplicated in the ancestor of eudicots, resulting in two eudicot orthologous groups . one of the two ring <dig> copies was lost in brassicaceae after the split from carica papaya. to more precisely determine the time of loss, we added tarenaya hassleriana orthologs to the gene tree  <cit>  . t. hassleriana belongs to cleomaceae, a sister group to brassicaceae. t. hassleriana sequences clustered in both eudicot orthologous groups. thus the loss of ring <dig> is brassicaceae-specific. the second eudicot copy of ring <dig> was subsequently duplicated in the α wgd  <cit> , before the divergence of brassicaceae. therefore, the two paralogs in a. thaliana, ring1a and ring1b, originated relatively recently, and non-brassicaceae eudicot lineages harbor a much more diverged pair of ring <dig> proteins. this reciprocal duplication and loss in brassicaceae could be an indication that ring1a or ring1b functionally replaces the lost ring <dig> gene in the second orthologous group, an example of paralogous gene displacement  <cit> .

bmi1a/b and bmi1c duplicated in the ancestor of eudicots
harboring the same domain structure as ring1a-b proteins, bmi <dig> proteins duplicated and diverged from ring <dig> proteins already before leca  <cit> . in plants, bmi <dig> proteins are present in mosses, lycophytes, monilophyets and gymnosperms . chlorophytes lost the rawul domain but retained the ring domain. thus, the earliest plant lineage with full-length bmi <dig> orthologs are indeed mosses  <cit> .

the genome of a. trichopoda harbors a single bmi <dig> gene, and three duplications in monocots ultimately yielded four monocot ring <dig> orthologous groups. two duplications in eudicots resulted in three eudicot orthologous groups. one contains bmi1a and bmi1b; these two paralogs emerged in the α wgd, a brassicaceae-specific duplication  <cit> . bmi1c, however, is a member of the second eudicot orthologous group; the divergence between bmi1a/b and bmi1c therefore predates eudicot speciation. the third eudicot orthologous group does not contain any brassicaceae sequences, suggesting a loss after divergence from c. papaya. therefore, similar to the ring <dig> tree, the brassicaceae-specific duplications and losses resulted in altered relationships between paralogs compared to other eudicots. three bmi <dig> gene copies in vitis vinifera, for example, are not 1: <dig> orthologs to the three bmi <dig> copies in a. thaliana, and their functions likely differ. one of the two recently duplicated paralogs  might functionally replace the lost paralog from the third eudicot orthologous group, the second example of paralogous gene displacement.

emf <dig> originated before gymnosperms
emf <dig> is a plant-specific protein with similar chemical properties to the c-terminal region of psc, the d. melanogaster ortholog of bmi <dig>  <cit> , as well as a similar function: both interfere with transcription  <cit> . emf <dig> has no annotated domains, and protein disorder prediction programs indicate that it is highly disordered , with a small globular part at the n-terminal end that could in fact be a protein domain. comparing disorder predictions to conserved motifs reveal that conserved motifs do not preferentially localize to either ordered or disordered regions .figure  <dig>

emf <dig> was recently shown to be present in eudicots only  <cit>  despite previous work showing its homologs in monocots  <cit> . our homology searches and gene tree revealed that emf <dig> originated earlier than previously thought: by using more sensitive methods we could recover emf <dig> orthologs not only in monocots and eudicots but also in a. trichopoda and in gymnosperms . in monocots and eudicots, emf <dig> orthologs are present mostly as single-copy genes. we could not recover emf <dig> orthologs in mosses. however, sequence fragments in a monilophyte transcriptome  <cit>  align with emf <dig> alignment but are too short to be unambiguously identified as emf <dig> orthologs. monilophyte genome sequences are therefore needed to firmly establish the point of emf <dig> invention.

previous work showed that emf <dig> has only few conserved motifs: nuclear localization signals, p-loop, and lxxll elements  <cit>  when compared to a putative rice ortholog. however with rice and lotus orthologs it shares five conserved motifs  <cit>  that do not overlap with those found previously. by using the de novo motif search algorithm meme and more plant species than previously, we can show that the five conserved sections predicted by calonje et al.  <cit>  are indeed conserved in the entire emf <dig> orthologous group , from gymnosperms to eudicots. in gymnosperms, the fifth motif  is only weakly conserved and the motif search algorithm does not recover it. in addition, we find a new, well-conserved motif  that corresponds to both a nls and a phosphorylation site. importantly, meme does not find gapped motifs and in case of insertions or deletions some motifs could have been missed. for example, the motif marked by a purple square is only a part of a longer motif with a highly conserved tryptophan and serine residue. however, as the introduction of gaps is necessary to compare the sequences, meme was able to find a shortened part in only few proteins.

surprisingly, we found that the ancestral emf <dig> gene duplicated twice in the ancestor of gymnosperms and angiosperms . this resulted in three orthologous groups that, next to emf <dig>  contain three novel outparalogs. all four genes show a conserved n-terminal part that is followed by weakly conserved motifs . the first orthologous group contains emf <dig>  the second orthologous group encompasses at5g <dig> and hapless <dig>   <cit> ; the two genes arose in a duplication before the speciation of brassicaceae. the third orthologous group contains at3g <dig> that is annotated as unknown protein. apart from hap <dig>  whose deletion hinders pollen tube growth, there is no functional data on the three outparalogs.

except for lack of gymnosperm sequences in one of the orthologous groups , the phylogenetic distribution in each orthologous group covers all seed plants, including monocots, a. trichopoda and nearly all eudicot sequences. monocot sequences tend to be truncated, however, and in the orthologous group with at3g <dig> several aligned loci are annotated as two separate genes.

vrn <dig> is the youngest addition to prc1
vrn <dig> was named after its role in vernalization; however, as its overexpression also causes a range of changes in plant organs, it seems to be also involved in more fundamental processes  <cit> . it does not interact with lhp <dig>  <cit>  nor are there any reports of it interacting with other prc <dig> subunits. while some suggest that vrn <dig> interacts with prc <dig> only at a specific subset of target genes  <cit> , others nevertheless assign it to prc <dig>  <cit> . we include vrn <dig> in the overview for the purpose of completeness.

vrn <dig> is characterized by two b <dig> domains that aspecifically bind dna  <cit> . the b <dig> domain emerged in the plant lineage and occurs in a range of different domain combinations  <cit> . this promiscuity as well as numerous ancient and lineage-specific gene and domain duplications make it difficult to reconstruct the relation of vrn <dig> to other b3-domain containing proteins. the gene tree that we inferred shows that the evolutionary history of vrn <dig> is rich in duplications . two consecutive duplications after the split of asterids  resulted in three orthologous groups. the vrn <dig> orthologous group has the shortest branches and therefore the slowest sequence evolution. next to vrn <dig> it also contains related to vernalization  <dig>  that lost its first b <dig> domain and only consists of a single b <dig> domain. the second orthologous group  underwent frequent gene losses. the third orthologous group  shows the longest branches. lineage-specific duplications are frequent, and several genes consist of only a single b <dig> domain. this orthologous group also contains three a. thaliana outparalogs, at1g <dig>  at4g <dig> and at3g <dig> . none of them is functionally characterized.figure  <dig> 
schematic gene tree of vrn <dig>  red squares show gene duplications. lineage-specific expansions are not depicted, with the exception of brassicaceae. og1- <dig> are the three orthologous groups as described in the main text. a. thaliana genes are denoted in blue letters.



previous work found five vrn <dig> paralogs in a. thaliana and two in p. trichocarpa  <cit> . in contrast, we report only a single copy of vrn <dig> and a truncated paralog , and indeed two p. trichocarpa orthologs. this result is probably due to phylogenetic trees enabling a more accurate way to distinguish inparalogs from outparalogs, i.e. to distinguish the vrn <dig> paralogs pre-dating ancient duplication events from those appearing afterwards.

discussion
in this paper, we reconstruct the history and map the present day occurrences of prc <dig> subunits. while the exact definition of prc <dig> is under debate , our inclusive definition of prc <dig> encompassed the core subunits as well as vrn <dig>  most importantly, we show that the subunits are present in more early diverging species than previously thought. prc <dig> subunits lhp <dig>  ring <dig> and bmi <dig> were present in leca. emf <dig>  a novel prc <dig> subunit, originated in the ancestor of seed plants. prc <dig> also gained novel interacting proteins, such as vrn <dig>  which stems from a duplication in eudicots, and others  <cit> . due to this as well as because of the losses in chlorophytes, prc <dig> subunits show a sporadic distribution across early diverging plant species .figure  <dig> 
presence/absence of prc <dig> components in the plant kingdom. the red-shaded area represents the core prc <dig> subunits. bmi <dig> orthologs in chlorophytes have lost the rawul domain . monilophytes might have emf <dig> orthologs but sequenced genomes are necessary to confirm this.



we are able resolve the discrepancy  <cit>  regarding the distribution of prc <dig> subunits across species due to improved phylogenetic methods and the availability of previously unsampled genomes and transcriptomes: in contrast to a recent study that reported limited phylogenetic distributions  <cit> , all prc <dig> subunits could be reliably inferred to have the same or even wider distributions than postulated earlier. even though transcriptome data have some intrinsic drawbacks, e.g. dependence on the sampled tissues and gene expression levels, the analyzed data was sufficient to broadly estimate the phylogenetic distribution of the prc <dig> subunits. the only exception is emf <dig> for which, due to its very low sequence conservation, transcriptome data is inconclusive, and a sequenced monilophyte genome could help to firmly establish the time of invention. we expect that more accurate genomes and gene annotations, especially of species at key positions on the phylogenetic trees, will resolve the few remaining questions.

we cannot recover lhp <dig> in chlorophytes, in agreement with hennig et al.  <cit> ; mosses are the earliest lhp1-harboring plants in our dataset. the function of lhp <dig> might be particularly important in more complex, multicellular lineages and the loss of lhp <dig> might not have been detrimental for plants with simpler morphology. genomes of chloropyhtes contain ring <dig> orthologs and the ring domain of bmi <dig>  the absence of other prc <dig> subunits strongly suggests that the ubiquitination activity of these proteins is important in other biological processes and that the proteins can moonlight as part of other protein complexes  <cit> . for example, prc <dig> and prc <dig> subunits were already shown to participate in other protein complexes in animals  <cit> . psc, d. melanogaster ortholog of bmi <dig>  is also involved in ubiquitination of cyc-b as part of cell cycle regulation, a cellular process unrelated to prc <dig>  <cit> . bmi1a and bmi1b have indeed been suggested in a. thaliana to act as ubiquitinases of protein dreb2a, a drought-inducible transcription factor  <cit> . moonlighting of proteins in diverse complexes or processes could also explain the stark difference in phenotypes that were observed for different mutants of prc <dig> subunits.

interestingly, the gene trees for ring <dig> and bmi <dig> proteins show that gene duplications in brassicaceae are accompanied by losses of paralogs in sister orthologous groups. these parallel events point to paralogous gene displacement. however, functional analysis of a. thaliana and non-brassicaceae orthologs are necessarily to confirm this.

in summary, we revealed that the complete core prc <dig>  existed in the ancestor of seed plants  and could have been instrumental in in establishing the complex developmental program of this group. the sporadic occurrence of prc <dig> subunits in chlorophytes and mosses strongly suggests moonlighting of the proteins, especially since emf <dig> is required for h2a ubiquitination activity in a. thaliana  <cit> . on the other hand, lhp <dig>  ring <dig> and bmi <dig> might already act as a primitive but functional prc <dig> in mosses. such a primitive prc <dig> could fulfill two roles: lhp1-mediated targeting to h3k27me3-marked nucleosomes and the ubiquitination activity provided by the ring proteins. h3k27me <dig> is catalyzed by prc <dig> that, similar to prc <dig>  also already existed in the ancestor of embryophytes  <cit> . prc <dig> subunits multicopy supressor of ira <dig>  and embryonic flower  <dig>  also interact with lhp <dig> in a. thaliana  <cit> . regardless of whether these protein-protein interactions are widely conserved, prc <dig> and a primitive prc <dig> could have formed a repressive mechanism for transcription already in the ancestor of embryophytes.

CONCLUSIONS
by using sensitive sequence search methods and inferring phylogenetic trees we show that the core prc <dig> existed in the last common ancestor of seed plants. the presence of lhp <dig>  ring <dig> and bmi <dig> in mosses, lycophytes and monilophytes also suggests the presence of a primitive yet functional prc <dig>  in addition, we uncover novel paralogs of emf <dig>  it remains to be shown whether their functional role is related to prc <dig>  lastly, the duplication-rich history of many prc <dig> subunits shows the intricate past of this complex and the necessity to use phylogenetic approaches to resolve the evolutionary relationships between paralogs and orthologs.
