BACKGROUND
wheat stripe rust is one of the most important diseases of wheat throughout the world. it is a major constraint in wheat production and is a serious threat to food security worldwide  <cit> . puccinia striiformis westend f. sp. tritici eriks is the causal agent of wheat stripe rust. it is an obligate biotrophic basidiomycete with an incomplete life cycle. because of the high variability in the pathogen population, race-specific resistance in many newly developed cultivars often fails within a few years of cultivation and results in severe yield losses. in the past century, most of the p. striiformis f. sp. tritici studies had been focused on the identification of physiological races, virulence variation, and ultrastructural and histological examinations  <cit> .

unlike the wheat stem rust fungus, the sexual stage of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici has not been identified. urediniospore is the most common spore form that has been observed in the wheat stripe rust fungus, which is strictly dependent on living host cells for growth and reproduction. to date, no stable transformation system has been established for p. striiformis f. sp. tritici and other puccinia species. these biological characteristics make molecular and genetic studies of this important fungus relatively more difficult. although much progresses have been achieved in researches on its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution  <cit> , there is only very limited knowledge about genes involved in the initial infection and biotrophic growth stages of the wheat stripe rust fungus. such knowledge is critical for understanding infection mechanisms of this important pathogen and developing better disease management strategies.

various genomic approaches, such as expressed sequence tag   <cit> , serial analysis of gene expression   <cit> , and massive parallel signature sequencing   <cit> , have been widely used in genome-wide gene expression studies in various organisms. est analysis was the first method used for rapid identification of expressed genes  <cit> . it has been employed to identify genes that are expressed in various tissues, cell types, or developmental stages in different organisms  <cit> . the availability of est sequences has accelerated molecular characterization of genes of interest and provided sequence information for microarray design.

est analyses have been conducted in a few rust fungi. to examine gene expression during infection of broad bean by uromyces fabae, hahn and his colleagues sequenced ests from purified haustoria. a major shift in gene expression was observed between urediniospore germination and the biotrophic growth stage  <cit> . a total of  <dig>  ests have been generated from  <dig> cdna libraries representing various stages of puccinia triticina, including resting and germinated urediniospores, appressorium and haustorium formation stages during infection of a susceptible wheat cultivar, and infected leaves of a resistant wheat cultivar. while 38% unigenes matched sequences in various databases and collections, the annotation rates were low for ests from germinated urediniospores  and appressoria . gene sets obtained from these different libraries appeared to be remarkably different, suggesting drastic reprogramming of the transcriptome during these major differentiation processes  <cit> . in this study, we generated a cdna library from germinated urediniospores of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici. a total of  <dig> ests were sequenced to generate  <dig> unisequences . the majority of these ests  had no significant homologs in genbank, indicating that many of them may represent genes unique to p. striiformis f. sp. tritici. several of these ests share significant homology with known fungal pathogenicity or virulence factors, such as hesp <dig> of the flax rust and pmk <dig> of the rice blast fungus. the high transcript level of six selected genes in germinated urediniospores was confirmed by quantitative real-time pcr  assays. some of these genes highly expressed in germinated urediniospores may be important for early infection processes in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.

RESULTS
generating ests of germinated urediniospores
to identify genes related to early events of urediniospore germination and differentiation, we incubated freshly harvested urediniospores of p. striiformis f. sp tritici  in sterile distilled water in plastic plates. after incubating for  <dig> h at 9°c, about 60% of urediniospores attached to the plastic surface and produced long, un-branched germ tubes . some of these germ tubes displayed various degree of swelling at the tip . germinated and un-germinated urediniospores were collected at  <dig> h and used for rna isolation. a directional cdna library consisting of  <dig>  ×  <dig> primary clones was constructed with the λtripex <dig> vector . on average, about 95% of the cdna clones had inserts longer than  <dig>  kb. the insert size varied from 200– <dig> bp, with an average of  <dig> bp. a total of  <dig> random cdna clones were sequenced from the 5'-end to obtain  <dig> quality reads or ests.

data analysis and functional classification
before clustering analysis, ests containing no insert sequence or insert shorter than  <dig> bp were removed. the remaining  <dig> ests were aligned and assembled into  <dig> contigs  and  <dig> singletons. a total of  <dig> unisequences  were submitted to dbest at ncbi  <cit>  under genbank accession numbers es <dig> – es <dig>  most of the uniseqs had the insert size of 200– <dig> bp. only  <dig> uniseqs were longer than  <dig> bp. the g+c content of these ests ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %, with an average of  <dig> %, which was similar to the g+c content of ests in p. graminis  <cit> .

the number of individual ests belonging to each contig ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . nine most abundant contigs contained more than  <dig> ests each, suggesting a high transcript level of the corresponding genes. contig ps <dig> was represented by  <dig> clones, more than any other contigs . it is homologous to a saccharomyces cerevisiae gene encoding a hypothetical protein. five of these most abundant contigs  had no homologs in est or protein database bases. three other abundant contigs displayed limited homology with entries in genbank. contig ps <dig> had weak homology with a putative secreted protein in ixodes scapularis. contig ps <dig> consisting of  <dig> ests was homologous to a differentiation-related protein inf <dig> from uromyces appendiculatus. inf <dig> was identified as infection structure protein that was highly expressed during urediniospore germination  <cit> . for contig ps <dig>  it consisted of  <dig> ests and was homologous to a predicted protein of kluyveromyces lactis.

all uniseqs were subjected to similarity searches against sequences in the non-redundant protein  database at genbank using the blastx algorithm. interproscan was used to analyze uniseqs with no blastx matches for known protein domains. the vast majority  of the uniseqs had no significant homolog in genbank by blastx search. among  <dig> uniseqs displayed similarity  to entries in the nr database, about 56% of them were similar to genes coding for proteins with unknown functions . the frequency of orphan sequences in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici ests is similar to that has been observed in other fungal est projects  <cit> .

among the  <dig> uniseqs that exhibited similarity to entries in the non-redundant protein database at genbank, about  <dig> % shared homology to proteins from filamentous fungi while the rest were homologous to proteins from a wide variety of organisms, including yeast, bacteria, nematodes, plants, insects, and animals . the uniseqs with significant similarity to hypothetical proteins were placed in the unclassified protein category. based on the results from blastx and interproscan searches, ests with significant matches were categorized according to their putative functions .

a the original est number and best hit were listed in additional file  <dig> .

a total of  <dig> uniseqs were identified to be homologous to proteins with known cellular functions. figure  <dig> listed the putative functions of these uniseqs and their occurrence. over 70% of them were functionally related to primary metabolism  and protein  or  rna synthesis. about 10% were involved in cellular signaling and defense responses. the ests with no hits in genbank were searched against the genome sequence of the wheat stem rust p. graminis  <cit> . many of them had homologous sequences in the genome of the stem rust fungus . a total of  <dig> uniseqs had no homologous sequences in the stem rust fungus genome. these ests may represent genes unique to p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.

putative pathogenicity or virulence factors identified in the germinated urediniospore ests
to date, many genes important for fungal pathogenesis have been identified in plant and human pathogens  <cit> . homology searches revealed that several ests were homologous to known fungal pathogenicity or virulence factors , including key components of signal transduction pathways, transporters, and genes involved in infection-related morphogenesis . for three genes related to signal transduction, ps <dig> encodes a putative adenylate cyclase that has been shown to be essential for pathogenicity in magnaporthe grisea, ustilago maydis, and several other fungi  <cit> . ps <dig> encodes a putative gα subunit that is similar to magb of m. grisea and gpa <dig> of cryptococcus neoformans  <cit> . the map kinase encoded by ps <dig> is homologous to pmk <dig> of m. grisea, which is important for regulating plant infection processes in a number of phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> .

ps <dig> and ps <dig> may be related to the infection structure differentiation . both of them were homologous to inf <dig> of u. appendiculatus and appeared to be members of a multigene family. inf <dig> is highly expressed during urediniospore germination. microinjection of antisense oligonucleotides of inf <dig> inhibits appressorium development in u. appendiculatus  <cit> . both ps <dig> and ps <dig> were contigs represented by over  <dig> ests, indicating that these two genes are highly expressed in germinated urediniospores, and may have similar functions during early stages of plant infection in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.

contigs ps <dig> and ps <dig> encoded proteins homologous to gegh <dig> of blumeria graminis  <cit> , which is highly expressed at early infection stages . in m. grisea, its homologs, gas <dig> and gas <dig>  are important virulence factors that are involved in appressorial penetration  <cit> . both gas <dig> and gas <dig> are specifically expressed during appressorium formation. we also identified two contigs, ps <dig> and ps <dig>  that were putative atp-binding cassette  transporter genes. in m. grisea and other plant pathogens, several abc transporter genes have been implicated in fungal-plant interactions, possibly by controlling the efflux of phytotoxic fungal metabolites or plant defensive compounds  <cit> .

we also identified an est, ps <dig> , that encodes a putative copper- and zinc-superoxide dismutase. in some fungal pathogens, such as candida albicans, superoxide dismutase is required for tolerance to oxidative stress and full virulence  <cit> . contig ps <dig> encoded a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acid residues. it is homologous a putative cell surface antigen gene in c. albicans  <cit>  and contains a cfem  domain that is unique to filamentous ascomycetes  <cit> . in m. grisea, the cfem domain-containing protein pth <dig> is known to play an important role in pathogenesis as a receptor  <cit> . pth <dig> is not required for appressorium morphogenesis in vitro but is involved in host surface recognition. the protein encoded by contig ps <dig> may play a similar role in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici, and is involved in appressorium differentiation.

ests homologous to known rust effectors or avirulence genes
the first avr protein identified in rust fungi was avrl <dig> of the flax rust fungus melampsora lini  <cit> . recently, a number of additional avirulence elicitors have been identified in the flax rust fungus  <cit> . in the ests of the wheat stripe rust fungus, we identified a candidate avirulence elicitor encoded by contig ps <dig>  which had significant homology with hesp <dig>  in the flax rust fungus, hesp <dig> is expressed in haustoria and may function as an effector in interactions with the host plant  <cit> . ps <dig> contained the full length open reading frame  that was predicted to encode a protein of  <dig> amino acid residues. it had a typical signal peptide at the n-terminus  as predicted by signalp  <dig>   <cit> . similar to hesp <dig>  ps <dig> may function as an effector or avirulence factor during wheat infection in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.

assaying the transcript level of six selected ests
six uniseqs, ps <dig> , ps <dig> , ps <dig> , ps <dig> , ps <dig> , and ps <dig> , were selected for assaying their transcript levels during different developmental and infection stages by quantitative real-time pcr . all these six genes were expressed in urediniospores, germinated urediniospores, and infected wheat tissues harvested at  <dig> through  <dig> days post inoculation . however, their transcription levels were much higher in germinated urediniospores than in un-germinated urediniospores or infected wheat tissues .

although the transcript level of these genes in infected wheat tissues was relatively low, they had different expression patterns during plant infection. in comparison with the others, ps <dig> had a relatively high transcript level in infected wheat plants. its expression was up-regulated from  <dig> to  <dig> dpi and then slightly decreased at  <dig> dpi. the transcript level of ps <dig> and ps <dig> increased at early infection stages but decreased after  <dig> dpi. the transcript level of ps <dig> and ps <dig> in wheat tissues was lower than that of the other ests examined. those two genes may be specifically and highly expressed during urediniospore germination. these data suggest that a considerable reprogramming of gene expression occurs during urediniospore germination, early stages of plant infection, and the biotrophic growth in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.

during incompatible interactions, ps <dig> also displayed an expression pattern that decreased at early stages but slightly increased after  <dig> dpi . the high transcript level of ps <dig> in germinated urediniospores suggests that it may be involved in germ tube growth and appressorium differentiation. it is possible that ps <dig> also plays a role in late stages of plant infection, probably for host-pathogen recognitions.

discussion
for plant pathogens with little or no history of genetic research, single-pass sequencing of random cdna clones as in est projects represents a relatively inexpensive and rapid procedure for finding novel genes and information about their expression. to date, extensive est databases have been established for various plant pathogenic fungi, including m. grisea  <cit> , phakopsora pachyrhizi  <cit> , and f. oxysporum  <cit> . for wheat rust fungi, only small est libraries have been described for p. triticina  <cit>  and p. graminis  <cit> . recently, a full-length cdna library has been constructed with rna isolated from un-germinated urediniospores of a race pst- <dig> isolate of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici  <cit> . among  <dig> random cdna clones sequenced from this library, only  <dig> of them  have homologs of known functions. most of them are involved in various housekeeping functions. a few ests encoding hypothetical proteins have homologs in other plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> . different from the cdna library constructed in this study, the library constructed by ling and colleagues may have high percentage of storage transcripts in un-germinated urediniospores.

urediniospore germination represents an early stage of the interaction of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici with host plants. as an obligate biotroph, germ tubes of the wheat stripe rust fungus fail to progress beyond this stage of development in vitro  <cit> . in this study, we constructed and sequenced a cdna library with rna isolated from germinated urediniospores. different from other filamentous fungi, a relatively high level of redundancy was found in this p. striiformis f. sp. tritici library. among the  <dig> ests generated in this study,  <dig> of them could be assembled into contigs. a few contigs consisting of over  <dig> est clones may represent genes that are highly expressed during urediniospore germination. when the uniseqs were queried against the nr protein database, about  <dig> % of them had no significant homology with proteins of known functions, which may be related to the difficulty of functional characterization of genes in rust fungi. among these contigs encoding proteins of known functions,  <dig> of them are ribosomal proteins. ests corresponding to genes encoding ribosomal proteins also are abundant in other fungal ests, such as those of b. graminis  <cit>  and m. grisea  <cit> .

the  <dig> uniseqs identified in this study contained a wide range of genes involved in different cellular functions. the most abundant genes during urediniospore germination were those involved in metabolic activities as well as those responsible for protein biosynthesis, which accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the uniseqs, respectively. a few genes are involved in rna synthesis, cell signal and communication, cell structure and growth, and cell/organism defense, indicating that active metabolism and protein synthesis is important for urediniospore germination and germ tube growth. several ests, including ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  shared similarity to differentiation-related protein inf <dig> from u. appendiculatus, which is specifically expressed during urediniospore germination  <cit> . ps <dig> has similarity to a chitin synthase from p. graminis f. sp. tritici. ps <dig> and ps <dig> were homologous to a deacetylase and a cell wall organization and biogenesis-related protein from c. neoformans, respectively  <cit> . these three genes may be involved in the modification of cell wall during urediniospore germination. the contig ps <dig> encodes a putative calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. the calcium-signaling pathway has been implicated in regulating appressorium formation in m. grisea and other plant pathogens  <cit> . in the wheat stripe rust fungus, it may regulate germ tube emergence and infection structure differentiation.

expression patterns of six selected uniseqs, ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  were examined by qrt-pcr analysis. the transcript level of these genes in germinated urediniospores was several-folds higher than in un-germinated urediniospores or infected wheat tissues, indicating that gene expression in the wheat stripe rust fungus changes dramatically during urediniospore germination and parasitic growth in wheat plants . these observations are consistent with what have been reported in u. fabae  <cit> .

a number of genes that are important for plant infection have been identified in various phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . several of them are key components of conserved signaling pathways. in the ests generated in this study, we identified several genes involved in signal transduction, such as ps <dig> and ps <dig> that encode a g-alpha subunit and a pmk <dig> homolog, respectively. similarly, several signaling components are identified in p. triticina ests, including the pmk <dig> homolog ptmapk <dig>  <cit> . the ptmapk <dig> gene has increased transcript levels during urediniospore germination and plant infection. when expressed in u. maydis, it can complement the defects of the kpp <dig> mutant in mating and plant infection  <cit> .

other putative fungal virulence or pathogenicity factors identified in this est analysis included contigs ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  ps <dig>  and ps <dig>  contigs ps <dig> and ps <dig> shared similarity to differentiation-related protein inf <dig> from u. appendiculatus. in u. appendiculatus, microinjection of inf <dig> antisense fragment into germinated urediniospores blocked its transcription and appressorium formation  <cit> . injection with sense fragments has no effect on responses of germ tubes to the topographical stimuli and development of appressoria. injection of antisense fragments into mature appressoria has no inhibitory effects on the development of subsequent infection structures. the inf <dig> protein appears to play a critical role in the germ tube before the formation of appressoria. the presence of inf <dig> homologs in this est library of germinated urediniospores suggested that they may have similar functions in the wheat stripe rust fungus.

ps <dig> and ps <dig> have similarity to gas <dig> and gas <dig> of m. grisea  <cit> , respectively. gas <dig> and gas <dig> are specifically expressed during appressorium formation and important for appressorial penetration in m. grisea. they are homologous to gegh <dig> of b. graminis and members of a small protein family unique to filamentous fungi. in several fungal pathogens, gegh <dig> homologs are expressed at early plant infection stages  <cit> . in the wheat stripe rust and leaf rust fungi  <cit> , gegh <dig> homologs may be involved in early stages of appressorium development. although ps <dig> was transcribed at a level higher than those of other ests in infected plant tissues, its transcript was much more abundant in germinated urediniospores . after germinating for  <dig> h, the germ tube tips tend to swell in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici . genes involved in appressorium formation may be highly expressed at this stage.

when reliable transformation systems become available for p. striiformis f. sp. tritici in the future, it will be important to determine the functions of these putative pathogenicity factors identified in this est library by generating gene knockout or silencing mutants. some of these genes highly expressed in germinated urediniospores may play important roles in fungal-plant interactions during early infection stages in the wheat stripe rust fungus.

CONCLUSIONS
a cdna library was constructed from germinated urediniospores of p. striiformis f. sp. tritici. a total of  <dig> ests were sequenced and assembled into  <dig> contigs and  <dig> singletons. about  <dig> % of the resulting  <dig> uniseqs had no significant homologs in genbank. among the uniseqs with assigned functions, over 70% of them were functionally related to primary metabolism and protein or rna synthesis. the rest were associated with various cellular functions. several of them were homologous to known fungal pathogenicity factors or effector proteins. the high transcript level of six selected ests in germinated urediniospores was confirmed by qrt-pcr. genes identified in this study to be highly expressed in germinated urediniospores may be important for early infection processes in p. striiformis f. sp. tritici.
