BACKGROUND
streptococcus pneumoniae is a gram-positive human pathogen responsible for serious diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis and sepsis  <cit> . the reservoir of s. pneumoniae is represented by asymptomatic carriage in the nasopharynx, particularly in young children  <cit> . the mechanism by which pneumococci become pathogenic is poorly understood, and probably depends on a complex interaction between bacterial virulence factors  <cit>  and the patients' immunological response  <cit> . the emergence of antibiotic-resistant s. pneumoniae strains has represented an additional problem in the management of pneumococcal infections  <cit> . s. pneumoniae strains that are resistant to commonly used antibiotics such as penicillins and macrolides are isolated from all areas of the globe  <cit> .

so far, more than  <dig> different s. pneumoniae serotypes have been recognized on the basis of immunochemical differences in the polysaccharide capsule and their number is probably due to increase  <cit> .

after implementation of the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine  in the usa, a profound change in the distribution of the serotypes colonizing children  <cit>  and causing diseases has been observed  <cit> . some of the so-called non-vaccine serotypes, that is serotypes not included in the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, are becoming increasingly common  <cit>  and increasingly antibiotic resistant  <cit> .

novel insights into the genome organization and metabolism of s. pneumoniae have been gained from analysis of complete genomes. to date,  <dig> pneumococcal strains, belonging to different serotypes including  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  6b,  <dig>  19a, 19f and 23f, have been completely sequenced, while other strains have been partially sequenced or are currently under way http://genome.microbio.uab.edu/strep/info/; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/projects/s_pneumoniae/;http://cmr.tigr.org; http://www.genomesonline.org http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/.

we have sequenced the complete genome of a clinical isolate  belonging to serotype 11a, sequence type   <dig>  a non-vaccine serotype that is currently on the rise, being one of the most prevalent serotypes isolated both from carriage  <cit>  and invasive diseases  <cit>  in north america following the introduction of pcv <dig>  according to brueggemann et al.  <cit> , serotype 11a is more associated with asymptomatic carriage than with invasive disease indicating a relatively low disease potential. however, serotype 11a strains, especially those belonging to st <dig>  are able to cause invasive disease with significant mortality  <cit> . the draft genomes of two other serotype 11a, st <dig> pneumococcal strains, sp11-bs <dig>  <cit>  and mlv- <dig> , are currently available in public databases.

ap <dig> has been previously reported to harbour the transposon tn <dig>  carrying the erythromycin resistance determinant erm, which is uncommon in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . the genome sequence yielded the whole sequence of tn <dig> and evidence for the presence of another exogenous element, a functional bacteriophage, designated ϕspn_ <dig> 

RESULTS
general genome features
the ap <dig> chromosome is circular and is  <dig> , <dig> base pair in length. the main features of the sequence are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> the initiation codon of the dnaa gene, adjacent to the origin of replication oric, was chosen as the base pair  <dig> for numbering the coding sequences. the overall gc% content is  <dig> % but an unusual asymmetry in the gc skew is evident near positions  <dig> - <dig> , likely resulting from recent acquisitions through horizontal gene transfer. the genome carries  <dig> coding sequences ,  <dig> trna, and  <dig> rrna genes grouped in four operons. of the predicted cdss,  <dig>  have a predicted biological known function;  <dig>  are similar to hypothetical proteins in other genomes, and  <dig>  have no substantial similarity to other predicted proteins.

the ap <dig> genome contains approximately  <dig> kb that are not present in tigr <dig> , the first sequenced pneumococcal strain  <cit> . besides two exogenous elements, such as the large tn <dig> transposon and a temperate bacteriophage designated ϕspn_ <dig>  the extra regions include the type 11a capsular locus, the pilus islet  <dig>  <cit> , and two metabolic operons . of the latter, one contains the genes of the arginine succinate pathway which is present in most pneumococci as a second alternative to the arginine deaminase pathway and the second likely contains genes for uptake, metabolism and excretion of sulphur containing amino-sugars. three other operons containing uptake systems of unknown substrates are also present. other regions of difference between tigr <dig> and ap <dig> include the presence in the latter of a dpnii restriction system and a double glycin-type bacteriocin gene . the extent and type of genomic variation between ap <dig> and tigr <dig> is in line with the genetic diversity found within this species by other studies comparing a series of pneumococcal genomes  <cit> .

comparison of the ap <dig> genome with tigr <dig> revealed also a large chromosomal inversion of approximately  <dig> kb across the replication axis and involving the termination site . large-scale inversions are typically driven by homologous recombination among repeated regions. the ap <dig> inversion borders fall within the coding sequences of phtb and phtd, two proteins which are part of the histidine-triad proteins family, characterized by the repeated histidine hxxhxh triad motif  <cit> . this family is composed of  <dig> proteins  showing high sequence similarity. phtb and phtd, which are involved in ap <dig> chromosomal inversion, reach approximately 87% amino acids identity.

chromosomal inversions are thought to be implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture when it is affected by insertions of large dna regions, such as transposons, is elements or prophages. in particular, it has been speculated that the chromosomal imbalance could be caused when large dna fragments are inserted in one side of the replication axis  <cit> , as in the case of ap <dig> genome, where the large exogenous elements resided in right of the replication axis. to date, the only pneumococcal genome described to carry a large chromosomal inversion is cgsp <dig>  <cit> . also in cgsp <dig> the inversion occurs across the termination site but involves a different region . inversions are present also in  <dig> recently sequenced pneumococcal genomes, taiwan 19f- <dig>  and tch8431/19a , although they have not been described . in these strains, the chromosomal inversions involve much larger regions. these observations suggest that the synteny of pneumococcal genome is not always conserved.

a striking feature of pneumococcal genomes is the over-distribution of is elements  <cit> . ap <dig> contains  <dig> transposases and inactivated derivatives thereof http://www-is.biotoul.fr/is.html. in order of frequency, the insertion sequences present in the genome are is <dig> , is1381-isspn <dig> , is <dig> , isspn <dig> and is <dig> , is <dig>  isspn1- <dig> and is1380-isspn <dig> , and is <dig> . interestingly, for  <dig> of these families, the number and insertion site of the is elements present in ap <dig> differ from those present in the other two serotype 11a, st <dig> strains, sp11-bs <dig>  and mlv- <dig> , although the draft genome status of these two strains makes it impossible to carry out a complete comparison. only  <dig> out of  <dig> is <dig> insertions, and only  <dig> out of  <dig> of the is1380-isspn <dig> insertions are shared between ap <dig> and the other serotype 11a strains, while one of the is <dig> copies is present in ap <dig> only and is integrated in the comc gene, making ap <dig> unable to develop natural competence. the fact that the insertion sites for is <dig>  is <dig>  and is <dig> copies vary between st <dig> strains suggests that these is elements maintained their ability to transpose within the strains. in ap <dig>  one copy of is <dig> is inserted within the nanb gene, producing a truncated neuraminidase b. in addition to these known is elements, other  <dig> non characterized elements are present in ap <dig> in a number of copy ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  these iss have been named from isspn_ap200_ <dig> to isspn_ap200_ <dig> 

notably, ap <dig> shares with the other serotype 11a st <dig> strains, an unique mutation in the 23s rrna  that is not present in the other sequenced pneumococci. this mutation has also been confirmed by sanger sequencing.

virulence factors
a plethora of virulence factors have been described in s. pneumoniae  <cit> . among them, the most important is the polysaccharide capsule, shielding pneumococci from the host natural immune defense. the capsular serotype of ap <dig> was identified as 11a according to the quellung reaction  <cit> , but sequence analysis revealed that the capsular locus matched closely that of serotype 11d. in particular, ap <dig> showed only  <dig> nucleotide changes when compared to the 11d capsular locus of the reference strain 70/ <dig>   <cit> : two silent transitions in wze and wcha, respectively, and a g/a transition  determining a change of a serine into an asparagine in the glycosyl transferase gene wcrl. also the capsular locus of the two other st <dig> serotype 11a strains, sp11-bs <dig>  <cit>  and mlv- <dig> , match with the 11d capsular locus. sp11-bs <dig>  like ap <dig>  has been repeatedly tested using the quellung reaction by us and by the pneumococcal reference laboratory at the statens serum institute, yielding consistently serotype 11a. from these results it appears that these st <dig> isolates have a serotype 11a phenotype, but possess an 11d capsular locus. the same conclusion has been reached by moon nahm's laboratory examining the serotype 11a isolates obtained at the centers for disease control and prevention in atlanta, ga .

sequence differences between capsular locus 11a and 11d cluster mainly in the insertion sequence  flanking the 5' end of the locus and in the wcje gene, encoding a putative o-acetyl transferase. while the biochemical structure of the type 11a capsule is known  <cit> , that of type 11d capsule has not been elucidated, therefore it is unclear which structural difference underlies the immunological difference. in addition, serotype 11d is quite rare, since no isolates of this serotype appear in the mlst database or in recent large datasets. on the other hand, recent findings indicate that serotype 11a has a high degree of genetic heterogeneity. a new pneumococcal serotype, designated 11e, has been recently discovered among isolates previously identified as serotype 11a, and has been found to be associated with a mutated or disrupted wcje gene  <cit> . on the basis of these data and our results it appears that serotype  <dig> is genotypically variable and it is likely that its typing scheme will be reconsidered in the near future.

most of the other pneumococcal virulence factors are surface-exposed proteins such as the choline-binding proteins  and the lpxtg proteins. ten different cbps genes have been recognized in the genome of ap <dig>  including pspa and pspc, which play an important role in pneumococcal pathogenicity  <cit> . both these proteins are characterized by an extensive polymorphism, likely reflecting the immunological selective pressure to which they are exposed. according to the classification of hollingshead et al.  <cit> , that defines  <dig> immunologically-relevant monophyletic groups  on the basis of the divergence of the pspa central region, ap <dig> pspa belongs to clade  <dig>  similarly, the pspc protein has been divided into  <dig> major groups due to unique sequence blocks  <cit> . according to this classification, ap <dig> pspc corresponds to pspc <dig> 

the lpxtg family includes proteins anchored to the peptidoglycan cell wall by the action of a sortase transpeptidase that recognises the motif lpxtg. pili, recently discovered in pneumococci, are composed of lpxtg-type protein subunits, and can be of  <dig> types, encoded by  <dig> different islets, pi- <dig> and pi- <dig>  <cit> . ap <dig> carries pi- <dig>  that is found in 20% of pneumococci only and has been demonstrated to mediate adherence to the epithelial cells of the respiratory tract  <cit> . the pi- <dig> region in ap <dig> is identical to that of serotype  <dig> pn <dig> strain  <cit> , being flanked by the hemh and pept genes, but is contained in the  <dig> kb inversion. of the two other sequenced serotype 11a st <dig> strains, only sp11-bs <dig> carries pi- <dig>  a recent investigation on the prevalence of pi-2-carrying pneumococcal isolates in atlanta, usa, highlighted the increase of serotypes carrying pi- <dig> among emerging non-pcv <dig> serotypes, including serotype 11a  <cit> .

four large surface zinc metalloproteinases have been described in s. pneumoniae, including the iga protease, which cleaves human iga <dig>  <cit> , the zmpc proteinase, which cleaves human matrix metalloproteinase  <dig>  <cit>  and zmpb and zmpd, whose substrates have not yet been identified  <cit> . the zinc metalloproteinases are involved in virulence and possess antigenic properties  <cit> . ap <dig> carries three of them, iga, zmpb and zmpc, lacking zmpd.

mobile genetic elements of ap200
tn1806
the tn <dig> transposon represents the sole erm-carrying genetic element reported in s. pneumoniae to date, and only a partial sequence was published by our group in  <dig>  <cit> . tn <dig> is  <dig>  bp in size, smaller than the size previously estimated by pcr mapping  <cit> , has a gc content of  <dig> %, and comprises  <dig> orfs. the chromosomal insertion site  of tn <dig> is characterized by the duplication of  <dig> nucleotides  representing the target sequence for the integration  <cit> . although various proteins related to mobilization are present, such as a trag/trad protein, a type iv secretory protein, a relaxase and  <dig> recombinases at the right end , conjugation experiments have failed to show transferability of tn <dig> to other strains  <cit> . other putative antibiotic resistance genes are present in tn <dig> in the region flanking erm, such as the two components of a tetronasin abc-type efflux system and a spectinomycin phosphotransferase. a tetr family transcriptional regulator is located upstream of the tetronasin efflux system, likely being involved in its regulation  <cit> .

tn <dig> shows an overall similarity with the erm-carrying genetic element described in streptococcus pyogenes mgas <dig>  named ice <dig> rd- <dig>  <cit> . ice, integrative and conjugative element, identifies a new classification nomenclature, grouping self-transmissible genetic elements previously designated as transposons, conjugative transposons, genomic islands and plasmids, sharing a common mechanism of horizontal transfer via site-specific recombination  <cit> . in this broad definition, also tn <dig> can be considered an ice. tn <dig> is approximately  <dig> kb larger than ice 10750-rd. <dig> due to the presence of additional regions . starting from the 5' end of the element, tn <dig> contains  <dig> additional orfs homologous to hypothetical proteins of the chimeric element rd <dig> of s. pyogenes mgas <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> orfs homologous to hypothetical proteins contained in the plasmid papre <dig> of anaerococcus prevotii dsm <dig>  and a retron-type reverse transcriptase inserted inside the adenine-specific dna methylase gene. in addition, in tn <dig> downstream erm,  <dig> transposases replace a cytidine deaminase and a zn-dependent hydrolase present in ice 10750-rd. <dig>  while  <dig> hypothetical proteins replace an orf, which is predicted to encode a death on curing protein, part of a toxin-antitoxin system . the antibiotic-resistance region, including the erm flanking genes, is present in ice <dig> rd- <dig>  <cit>  as well as in other s. pyogenes erm-carrying elements recently described  <cit> .

comparative nucleotide analysis with current databases revealed that tn <dig> shows large regions of homology with other putative genetic elements present in the sequenced genomes of different bacterial species, including finegoldia magna atcc  <dig>   <cit>  and clostridium difficile m <dig> , and with papre <dig>  a plasmid of a. prevotii dsm <dig> . all these species are anaerobic opportunistic pathogens; f. magna and a. prevotii share the same ecological niche, i.e. the oral cavity, with s. pneumoniae and s. pyogenes, while c. difficile is part of the intestinal microflora. the genetic elements of these three anaerobic species share a high nucleotide identity  especially with the leftmost part of tn <dig> . sequences with similarity to tn <dig> have been found also in the incomplete genome of ureaplasma urealyticum serovar  <dig> atcc  <dig>  and in other incomplete genomes belonging to anaerococcus spp. and peptoniphilus spp. all these genetic elements share large fragments, with insertions/deletions or replacement of different modules that probably confer element-specific features. modules can contain different accessory genes: one example is represented by the antibiotic-resistance region that is present in tn <dig> and ice <dig> rd- <dig>  but is missing in the other genetic elements. in f. magna, this region is replaced by a module of similar size including multidrug abc transporter proteins . these elements, carried by different bacterial species, likely diversify and evolve through the reciprocal shuffling of regions in putative hot spots; the diversity likely reflects the adaptation to different niches and/or to the antibiotic selective pressure.

ϕspn_ <dig> prophage genome
the second exogenous region identified in ap <dig> corresponds to a prophage designated ϕspn_ <dig>  the ϕspn_ <dig> genome is  <dig>  kb in size with a gc content of  <dig> %, which is consistent with that of s. pneumoniae. ϕspn_ <dig> is inserted between the adenylosuccinate synthetase and the trna-specific adenosine deaminase genes. sequence analysis of the junctions between the ϕspn_ <dig> genome and the host chromosome revealed the presence of a 21-bp duplication , likely derived from the recombination between the bacterial  and the phage  attachment sites. the confirmation that the 21-bp region corresponds to the attp site was obtained by sequencing the dna of the phage circular forms.

the genome of ϕspn_ <dig> includes a total of  <dig> orfs organized into five modules: the lysogeny, the replication, the packaging, the structural, and the lytic modules . such modular organization, especially the presence of closely arranged lysogeny-related genes, resembled that of the siphoviridae family infecting low-gc content gram-positive bacteria  <cit> . the predicted orfs were compared with sequences from protein databases and the regions of homology of the ϕspn_ <dig> genome are described in detail in the additional file  <dig> 

the lysogeny module is located immediately downstream of the left-end att site; it is composed of the integrase, belonging to the family of tyrosine recombinases, the cro/ci-like transcriptional regulator and the repressor involved in suppression of the phage lytic cycle . the second module carries genes with regulatory functions implicated in the replicative processes. the third module includes genes implicated in the packaging of the phage genome concatemers into the empty capsid shell, such as the large terminase gene. the structural region encodes the morphogenetic proteins involved in the head and tail assembly. among these proteins, it is noteworthy the presence of pblb that corresponds to the phage tail fiber, involved in tail/host recognition. this protein is also considered a phage-encoded virulence factor  <cit> . in streptococcus mitis, pblb is carried by the bacteriophage sm <dig> and together with pbla, a protein that is missing in ϕspn_ <dig>  it can enhance binding of the microorganism to platelets  <cit> . no other potential virulence factor was identified in ϕspn_ <dig>  but it must be considered that no function was assigned to  <dig> out of  <dig> phage orfs. the last phage module includes genes implicated in cell lysis and phage progeny release, such as those encoding lysin and holin proteins. holin acts creating holes in the cell wall, thereby allowing lysin to enter the periplasm and begin cell lysis.

an almost identical prophage, inserted in the same chromosomal region at the identical attb attachment site, is present in the newly sequenced s. pneumoniae strain hungary19a- <dig> , and in the draft genomes of cdc1873- <dig>  and sp14-bs <dig>  . interestingly, a prophage inserted in the same site of ϕspn_ <dig>  is present also in the sp11-bs <dig> genome, named ϕspn_ <dig>  <cit> . ϕspn_ <dig> and ϕspn_ <dig> represent different phages although they share the integrase and the following orf of the lysogeny module,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes of the replication module and all the lytic genes . comparative analysis revealed that ϕspn_ <dig> showed various degree of similarity with other streptococcal prophages. the ϕspn_ <dig> packaging and structural modules are highly similar to the corresponding regions of phage lambdasa <dig> of streptococcus agalactiae  <dig> v/r  <cit> , with an amino acid identity ranging from  <dig> to 92% . the presence in ϕspn_ <dig> of functional modules, carried also by a different phage, supports the modular theory of phage evolution  <cit>  according to which the diversification of phages genomes resides mainly on the exchange of entire modules between different phage groups. indeed, in pneumococcal phages the exchanging unit could consist also in a single gene  <cit> , as it was the case suggested by the homology of single genes of the replication module of ϕspn_ <dig> with the corresponding genes of phage mm <dig> of s. pneumoniae  <cit> , of phage sm <dig> of s. mitis  <cit>  and lambdasa <dig> of s. agalactiae  <dig> v/r  <cit> .

according to a recently published prophage typing system  <cit> , the pneumococcal phages can be classified into three main groups, of which group  <dig> is the most abundant. on the basis of nucleotide homologies, ϕspn_ <dig> can be assigned to group  <dig> 

electron microscopic characterization and infection activity of ϕspn_200
concentrated supernatants of mitomycin-induced s. pneumoniae ap <dig> cultures were examined by transmission electron microscopy. ultrastructural analysis revealed the presence of phage particles consisting of a small isometric head with a diameter of  <dig> ±  <dig> nm and a long flexible tail of  <dig>  ±  <dig> nm, characteristics belonging to the siphoviridae family  <cit>  . a collar structure was observed at the position where head and tail meet . since only one prophage was detected in the genome of ap <dig>  we concluded that the phage observed by electron microscopy was ϕspn_ <dig> 

the infection activity of ϕspn_ <dig> was tested on the pneumococcal strain rx <dig>  <cit> . results obtained demonstrated that ϕspn_ <dig> induced the formation of lysis plaques on the rx <dig> culture plates .

CONCLUSIONS
the number of sequences of bacterial genomes has been rapidly increasing in the last years thanks to the use of new technologies, such as the high-throughput roche  <dig> pyrosequencing  <cit> . s. pneumoniae serotype 11a is becoming an emergent serotype in the post-pcv <dig> era and data concerning its genetic characteristics can be of importance for future vaccines. the reasons determining the increase in the incidence of pneumococcal infections due to non vaccine-serotypes, including serotype 11a, are complex and not yet fully understood. multiple factors could take part in this phenomenon, such as geographical and temporal trends, the prevalence of these serotypes in the community, the ability to evade host defenses, the acquisition of new genetic material that could potentially increase their invasive capacity or their resistance to antibiotics  <cit> .

in this study, the entire genomic sequence of s. pneumoniae ap <dig>  belonging to serotype 11a and st <dig>  has been obtained. sequence analysis revealed chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. a large chromosomal inversion across the replication axis was found: it is likely that this inversion originated to maintain the genome stability affected by horizontal gene transfer events, as suggested by ding et al.  <cit> . the presence of large genomic inversions is a phenomenon observed in other streptococcal species, where it could contribute to generate chromosomal shuffling and create novel genetic pools  <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer events involved mainly two mobile elements, the erm-carrying genetic element tn <dig> and the functional prophage ϕspn_ <dig>  the modular organization recognized inside the two exogenous elements, and their similarity to other elements of different bacterial species, confirm that they have undergone frequent dna exchanging events, that appear to be the major contributors to the overall diversity of the genome of s. pneumoniae ap <dig> 

although the availability of complete pneumococcal genomes cannot provide a full explanation for the evolution and spread of a particular serotype or clone, it can contribute information on the pathogenic potential of this important microorganism. regarding ap <dig>  the presence of pilus islet  <dig> could confer a selective fitness advantage, mediating adherence to the nasopharingeal epithelium and could represent a target for future vaccines  <cit> . in addition, the presence of the transposon tn <dig>  conferring erythromycin-resistance, is an advantage to the microorganism in view of the large use of macrolides in the community. finally, in ap <dig> the discrepancy between the serotyping result and the sequence of the capsular locus deserves further investigations, also in view of the increasing use of pcr-based methods for serotype determination.
