BACKGROUND
cells have the ability to respond and adapt to environmental changes through the activation of stress-activated protein kinases . a well-studied prototype of sapk is the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisae hog <dig>  upon osmotic shock, two complex molecular osmosensing systems located at the plasma membrane convert the extracellular information into a signal that leads to a rapid and transient hog <dig> activation and nuclear translocation of this sapk  <cit> . the activity of hog <dig> is essential for adaptation to osmostress and regulates key biological processes such us cell cycle and gene expression  <cit> . in response to osmostress, the hog <dig> sapk is a key regulatory element for the activation of a specific osmostress-induced gene program. genome-wide transcription studies have revealed that close to a 7% of the whole budding yeast genome had significant and transient changes in the expression levels of the genes after osmotic shock. moreover, up to 70% of those regulated genes depend on the hog <dig> sapk activity. taken together, the data in yeast indicate that there is a key role for sapks in reprogramming the gene expression capacity of cells in response to external stimulus  <cit> . the mammalian structural and functional homolog of the hog <dig> sapk is the p <dig> family of sapks. it is worth noting that heterologous expression of the p <dig> sapk is able to rescue the sensitivity to osmostress of a hog <dig> deficient yeast strain  <cit> . in contrast to hog <dig>  which is activated primarily upon osmostress, mammalian p <dig> sapks are activated in response to many insults such as infection, inflammatory cytokines, anisomycin and by a broad range of environmental stresses . four genes encode p <dig> sapks in mammals. however, whereas p38α and p38β seem to have overlapping functions and are widely expressed, being p38α the most abundant protein in all tissues, p38γ and p38δ are expressed in specific cell types and are likely to have specialised functions. moreover p <dig> sapks have been involved in several biological processes such as inflammation, cell growth, cell differentiation, cell cycle and cell death  <cit> . although it has been shown that p <dig> mapk signalling participates in the regulation of gene transcription little is known on the molecular mechanisms used by this sapk to regulate stress-responsive gene expression as well as the overall set of genes regulated by p <dig> in response to different stimuli  <cit> . p <dig> sapk transcriptional profiles have been described in primary endothelial cells from human umbilical veins and rat fibroblasts-like synuviocytes after long term incubation with tnfα  <cit> , in response to the inhibition of the p <dig> sapk in primary human keratinocytes  <cit>  and proliferating cardiomyocites  <cit> . however comprehensive genome-wide transcription studies describing the involvement of the p <dig> sapk on immediate stress-induced genes or a comparative analysis of the genes that respond to different stimuli under the sapk activation have not been reported to date.

to gain a deeper knowledge on the p <dig> sapk transcriptome we have performed whole genome microarray analysis using mouse embryonic fibroblasts  treated with different p <dig> sapk activators, namely osmostress, the cytokine tnfα and the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin. in addition, we have analysed the contribution of p38α, the major p <dig> family member present in mefs to the overall transcription in response to those stimuli by using both the chemical inhibitor sb <dig> and p38α knockout mefs. the results obtained show a complex gene pattern response specific for a given stress with a restricted set of overlapping genes being both highly dependent on p <dig> sapk activity.

RESULTS
the activation kinetics of p38α sapk in response to external insults depends on the stimuli
to analyse the kinetics of activation of p <dig> sapk in response to several stimuli, we assessed p <dig> sapk phosphorylation on the activating residues thr <dig> and tyr <dig> by western blot using a phospho-specific antibody. addition of tnfα  to mefs induced a rapid and sharp activation of the sapk followed by a quick down-regulation. on the other hand, anisomycin, at a concentration that does not fully block protein synthesis   <cit> , was able to activate p <dig> sapk to a greater extent, peaking at  <dig> minutes, decreasing slowly afterwards and with a clear reduction after  <dig> minutes. an hyperosmotic shock induced by nacl  was able to activate p <dig> sapk with a slower kinetics than tnfα with a peak at  <dig> minutes followed by a down-regulation. anisomycin had a similar kinetic to that seen for osmostress. moreover, both anisomycin and nacl induced longer p <dig> sapk activation than tnfα over time . therefore, all the stimuli tested were able to transiently activate p <dig> sapk although with different kinetics.

importantly, the three stimuli did not induce detectable p <dig> sapk activation in p38α-/- mefs, indicating that these cells represent a useful tool to study the loss of function of p <dig> sapk . we also confirmed that the chemical inhibitor sb <dig> did no prevent p38α phosphorylation but impaired the phosphorylation of the p <dig> sapk substrate mk <dig>  indicating that was able to inhibit p <dig> activation . we were not eble to detect mk <dig> phosphorylation upon tnfα addition at 5'. therefore we extended the incubation time with this cytokine. after 15' of tnfα addition we could detect a slow migrating form of the mk <dig> protein that correlated with its phosphorylation. both events were prevented by the p <dig> sapk chemical inhibitor sb <dig> .

activation of p <dig> by different stimuli leads to the regulation of different sets of genes
to analyse the gene expression changes mediated by p <dig> sapk in response to different stimuli, wild type and p38α knockout mefs were treated with tnfα  for  <dig> minutes, anisomycin  for  <dig> minutes and nacl  for  <dig> h. in addition, wild type mefs were also pre-treated with  <dig> μm sb <dig> for  <dig> min before stimulation. after cell treatments, total rna from two independent experiments was extracted, quantified and validated by northern blot  prior to being converted to cdna, labelled and hybridized with a mouse 44k whole genome microarray from agilent. the microarray contained  <dig>  probe-ids representing  <dig>  unique genes  with every gene being covered on average by at least two different probes. the hybridizations were referenced to a pool of cdnas from two non-treated wild type mefs used as a background control. the raw microarray and normalized data have been deposited in the gene expression omnibus database . to assess the statistical robustness of our microarray data we performed a pearson correlation coefficient  analysis for all the probes found on the microarray using the statistical program r . all samples showed a high correlation coefficient between the two replicates with most correlation values higher than  <dig> , indicating a high reproducibility between the experimental duplicates . the quality of the microarray data was also diagnosed using the bioconductor package arrayqualitymetrics  <cit> . the quality of the microarray data was determined by ma plots whereas the reproducibility and homogeneity between the experiments was assessed respectively by box plots and density plots. all these analyses showed a high quality for both the array data and the experimental duplicates . once we assessed the quality and reproducibility of the raw data we took the log <dig> ratio average of the two independent hybridizations per biological condition and subsequently the agilent probe-ids were converted to unique ensemble gene-ids. on top of that, to minimize the false positives, we set up  <dig> -fold induction cut off and considered those genes as true stress-induced genes and selected them for further analysis. the treatments with tnfα and anisomycin induced  <dig> -fold a total of  <dig> and  <dig> unique genes, respectively, whereas nacl induced  <dig> unique genes . although there is some gene overlapping between the treatments, each stimulus induced a large set of specific genes. the common response to the three treatments was limited to  <dig> unique genes .

we then analysed the contribution of p38α sapk to the gene expression changes induced by different stimuli. to this end, we compared the gene expression profiles from wild type mefs either with those obtained from p38α-/- mefs and from wild type mefs treated with the p38α/p38β sapk inhibitor sb <dig>  we considered that a gene was dependent on p <dig> sapk activity when its expression was reduced at least 50% in sb <dig> treated mefs or in p38α-/- mefs. taking this into account, the p <dig> sapk dependency ranged between 60% and 88% depending on the treatments . interestingly, the venn diagrams  showed in all cases a large degree of overlapping between the genes affected in p38α-/- knock out mefs and sb203580-treated mefs, supporting that expression of these genes was indeed p <dig> dependent. a full list of the up-regulated genes and their p <dig> sapk dependency is accessible as supplementary material in an excel spreadsheet .

to validate our microarray analyses, we selected a few representative stress-regulated genes and tested their mrna levels by rt-pcr. notably, the tendency of regulation observed by rt-pcr confirmed the expression levels found in the microarrays. thus, the tnfα cell signalling regulator a <dig> was only up-regulated by tnfα whereas the transcription factor c-jun and the cell proliferation regulator btg <dig> were mostly up-regulated by anisomycin. on the other hand, the pro-inflammatory gene ptgs2/cox <dig> was highly up-regulated by nacl and to a lesser extent by anisomycin and tnfα. in all cases, the expression levels of the corresponding mrnas were significantly reduced in both, sb <dig> treated wild type mefs and p38α-/- knock out mefs .

activation of p <dig> sapk by different stimuli also resulted in the down-regulation of some genes. taking into account genes that were down-regulated at least  <dig> fold, the treatment with nacl affected the expression of  <dig> genes, anisomycin  <dig> genes and tnfα  <dig> genes. interestingly, the p38α dependency of genes down-regulated by nacl ranged between  <dig> and 68%, while the genes down-regulated with anisomycin or tnfα were completely dependent on p <dig> sapk , suggesting that the stress response down-regulates several genes and this pathway is also important in the process.

analysis of the function of induced genes shows major stimulus-specific responses and a restricted common response to all treatments
to better understand the role of the genes induced in response to each stimulus, we have performed a gene set enrichment analysis based on the gene ontology  categories corresponding to cellular component, molecular function, and biological process  <cit>  as described in methods. the cell component enrichment revealed that nacl up-regulated in a p <dig> sapk dependent manner many genes encoding members of the ribonucleoprotein complex, including several proteins of the large and small ribosome subunit. in addition, nacl and anisomycin but not tnfα up-regulated dna associated proteins such us the histone variants h1fo, h1d, h1t, h <dig> , h2a type f, novel h2b, h2a type  <dig>  h <dig> f3a and h <dig> b. on the other hand, tnfα induced genes encoding many plasma membrane proteins, including components of the major histocompatibility complex such us h2-ob, h2k <dig>  h2q <dig>  h2q <dig> and b <dig> m .

furthermore the analysis for enrichment of the molecular function showed that nacl specifically up-regulated genes encoding for trans-membrane transporters belonging to the solute carrier family of transporters like slc15a <dig>  slc35f <dig>  slc6a <dig>  slc5a <dig>  slc22a <dig>  slc20a <dig> and slc38a <dig>  interestingly among this group of genes we also found several ion trans-membrane transporters like accn <dig>  trpm <dig> and kcnv <dig>  notably the main enriched molecular function induced by the three treatments was the up-regulation of a set of genes belonging to the transcription factor activity go term. nacl up-regulated  <dig> transcription factors while anisomycin and tnfα up-regulated  <dig> and  <dig> transcription factors respectively. each treatment specifically up-regulated an specific set of transcription factors. for instance, nacl induced the expression of mafk, n-myc, foxg <dig>  foxc <dig>  hoxc <dig> and runx <dig>  whereas anisomycin induced the transcription factors fosb, sox <dig>  smad <dig>  ddit <dig>  klf <dig> and egr <dig>  on the other hand tnfα induced nfatc <dig>  pax <dig>  lhx <dig>  gsc, nkx2- <dig>  fosl <dig> and irf <dig>  thus, the differential regulation of transcription factors seems to be a key process to build up the appropriate gene response for cell adaptation to a particular stress. it is worth noting that, in contrast to nacl and tnfα, anisomycin also induced a set of genes belonging to the id family of transcription repressors, such as id <dig>  id <dig> and id <dig>  in addition, tnfα and anisomycin also enhanced genes belonging to the go term chemokine activity. as expected, these genes were also induced in cells treated with the pro-inflammatory tnfα cytokine but the overall response was less prominent in anisomycin-treated cells. for instance anisomycin up-regulated the chemokines ccl4/20/ <dig> and cxcl <dig> whereas tnfα also induced the chemokines ccl2/ <dig>  cxcl1/2/3/5/ <dig>  and the cytokines csf <dig>  spp <dig>  tslp and gdf <dig>  taken together, our data indicate that anisomycin partially elicits a tnfα mediated response .

finally, we analysed for the biological process go term and found that nacl and anisomycin strongly up-regulated genes involved in the rna biosynthesis process. moreover, the three stimuli were able to induce the processes of cell migration, cell proliferation, programmed cell death and, as expected, response to stress. however the response to stress induced by nacl was milder after  <dig> h of stress compared to that elicited by anisomycin or tnfα, which up-regulated a large set of genes. moreover, tnfα clearly promoted the up-regulation of genes implicated in the responses to wounding and inflammation as well as in the immune response and chemotaxis. anisomycin also up-regulated genes related to these biological processes, although to a lesser extent than tnfα, indicating that this compound somehow partially mimics tnfα action . a full list of the genes found in each category is presented in the supplementary web file 

as previously reported activation of the p <dig> pathway promotes its down-regulation through the expression of dual specificity phosphatase  genes  <cit> . although the induction of this particular biological process was not found to be statistically enriched among the three treatments, this is due that different stimuli induced different sets of dusp genes. thus, tnfα induced dusp <dig>  dusp <dig> and dusp <dig>  anisomycin induced dusp <dig>  dusp <dig>  dusp <dig> and dusp <dig>  whereas nacl induced dusp <dig>  dusp <dig> and dusp <dig>  therefore, p <dig> sapk activation contributed to different extend to dusp gene up-regulation. the up-regulation of these phosphatases might differentially contribute to the kinetics of the stress response mediated by a particular stimulus.

to further mine the microarray data, we performed an ingenuity pathway analysis  that allows us to infer the most relevant gene networks controlled by p <dig> sapk signalling. according to the molecular functions and biological processes mentioned above, the most relevant gene network induced by tnfα was related to the immune response and immunological disease functions . instead, the anisomycin gene network was related to the regulation of cell development and gene expression. the main transcription factors induced were c-fos, jun, nfatc <dig>  ddit <dig>  sox <dig>  maff and id <dig> . osmostress induced a gene network that is related to the control of cell cycle and posttranslational modification with the c-fos, egr <dig>  foxg and prrx <dig> as the main transcription regulators .

as mentioned above, all three treatments strongly induced a core of  <dig> common genes which expression showed a high dependency on p <dig> sapk activity . overall, the p <dig> sapk dependency ranged from 63% in p38α-/- cells to 83% in sb <dig> treated wild type mefs. interestingly,  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes are common transcription factors, namely c-fos, n-myc, jun, egr <dig> and maff , which represents a significant enrichment for this functional category. due to the relative small number of common genes, we could not identify any trend on p <dig> sapk independent genes. for those p38-dependent genes, the ipa software allowed us to uncover the most relevant common gene networks which are those mainly involved in the control of gene expression, cell cycle and cell fate .

kinetic analysis of p <dig> sapk-mediated gene expression in response to osmostress
little is known on the kinetics of gene expression in response to p <dig> sapk activation. to shed some light on how this pathway regulates gene transcription in a time dependent manner, mefs cells were subjected to osmostress  in the absence or the presence of the sapk inhibitor sb <dig>  cells were collected at  <dig> minutes,  <dig> h and  <dig> h upon osmostress and rnas were subjected to microarray analysis as before. as described above, the average of two independent hybridizations was taken and the probe-ids were converted to unique ensemble gene-ids. genes up-regulated at least  <dig> -fold were selected for functional analyses.

as shown in figure 7a, a total of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated  <dig> -fold upon osmostress at  <dig> minutes,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. a full list of up-regulated genes is provided as supplementary material in an excel spreadsheet . the overlapping among different time-points was restricted to a subset of genes, being most of them specifically up-regulated in a time dependent manner. it is worth noting that the p <dig> sapk dependency for the osmostress-responsive genes decreased over time. thus, 90% of the genes up-regulated by nacl at  <dig> minutes were affected by sb <dig>  whereas this percentage dropped to 74% at  <dig> h and 62% at  <dig> h after salt addition . therefore, the role of p <dig> sapk in the regulation of gene expression appears to be critical for the early response to stress, whereas other signaling pathways also become important at later stages of the adaptation process.

a major molecular function controlled by stress is the up-regulation of genes encoding for transcription factors. thus, we assessed the number of transcription factors that were specifically up-regulated by nacl in a time dependent manner and found that they increased over time. osmostress induced  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcription factors at  <dig> minutes,  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively . the overlapping among the three time points of the study was restricted to a subset of transcription factors. thus,  <dig> transcription factors were up-regulated at  <dig> minutes of nacl treatment, and  <dig> transcription factors were up-regulated at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively. we also detected  <dig> transcription factors that were induced at  <dig> minutes and  <dig> h, but not at  <dig> h. although a cyclic expression pattern cannot be ruled out, a most plausible explanation would be that the probe hybridization failed at the middle time-point and that those transcription factors were in fact up-regulated very early and remained high till later times. interestingly, all the transcription factors up-regulated at  <dig> minutes upon osmostress were dependent on p <dig> sapk activation. however, the p <dig> sapk dependency decreased to 65% and 46% at  <dig> h and  <dig> h, respectively, after nacl addition . these data suggest that the primary wave of up-regulated transcription factors plays a key role on cell adaptation to osmostress and it is mainly driven by the activation of the p <dig> sapk. in addition, other osmostress-activated signalling pathways are activated at later times to contribute to stress adaptation. a comprehensive list of the up-regulated transcription factors and its p <dig> sapk dependency is shown in figure 8c.

we validated our microarray analyses monitoring selected osmostress regulated genes by rt-pcr. the transcription factors n-myc and c-fos, the dual specifity phosphatase dusp <dig> and the mrna binding protein tpp were all highly up-regulated between  <dig> minutes and  <dig> h after osmostress and their mrna levels dropped at the  <dig> h time point with the exception of dusp <dig> which levels remained constant between  <dig> h and  <dig> h after nacl addition. on the other hand, the aldo-keto reductase akr1b <dig>  and the heat shock protein hspa4l genes were up-regulated later and their mrna levels increased after  <dig> h of osmostress. in addition, the mrna level of all these genes was clearly reduced in the presence of the inhibitor sb <dig> confirming that their expression was dependent to some extent on the p <dig> signalling pathway .

gene ontology analysis of p <dig> sapk-mediated gene expression in response to osmostress
to gain additional insights into the function of osmostress induced genes in addition to the transcription factors, we performed a comparative go gene enrichment analysis as described above at  <dig> minutes,  <dig> h and  <dig> h upon osmostress. we focussed the analysis in the most relevant gene categories up-regulated upon osmostress and we took into account the p <dig> sapk dependent genes. the go term cell component showed that most of the genes induced by p <dig> sapk at  <dig> minutes encode for proteins that function at the plasma membrane. however, after  <dig> h of osmostress many up-regulated genes encode proteins that function in the ribonucleoprotein complex or are located in the cell nucleus and the chromatin. these two cell locations were also enriched  <dig> h after salt addition. at  <dig> h, we also found enrichment in some other sub-nuclear locations, namely the nucleolus and the nuclear pore complex .

the main p <dig> sapk dependent molecular function elicited by osmostress at  <dig> minutes is related to g-protein-coupled receptor activity and ion trans-membrane transporters. as described above, the transcription factor activity go term was considerably enriched at  <dig> minutes and increased progressively over time after nacl addition. on the other hand, at later times p <dig> induced chemokine and cytokine activities as well as protein serine/threonine kinase activity . importantly, long exposure to osmostres also up-regulated several serine/threonine kinases  some transmembrane protein tyrosine kinase receptors , src-like tyrosine kinases  and dual specificity serine/tyrosine kinases .

the third go analysis performed gave us information on the biological processes regulated in a p <dig> sapk- in a time-dependent manner. as shown in figure 10c, the major up-regulated biological process at  <dig> minutes was the surface-linked signal transduction. this observation is in full agreement with the main cell location and molecular function of the genes found up-regulated at that time. moreover from  <dig> h after the addition of nacl we found enrichment of genes involved in the processes of cell migration, cell proliferation, rna biosynthesis, negative regulation of programmed cell death and response to stress. finally long exposure to nacl induced the up-regulation of a different set of genes involved in the control of the inflammatory response, cell growth and protein dephosphorylation . the last process is partly related to the down-regulation of mapk activity. for instance, osmostress specifically induced several dusps at different times. dusp <dig> was up-regulated at  <dig> minutes and their levels remained high till  <dig> h after osmostress. after  <dig> h of nacl addition, dusp <dig> and dusp <dig> were up-regulated and the expression levels of dusp <dig> remained high till the  <dig> h time-point. on the other hand, dusp <dig> was specifically up-regulated at  <dig> h. on top of that, several tyrosine phosphatases were upregulated at  <dig> h of osmostress  as well as the serine/treonine phosphatase ppmd <dig>  altogether, the up-regulation of phosphatases suggests that this is an important event to down-regulate osmostress-induced signalling pathways.

it should be noted as well, that long exposure to nacl induced a strong stress and defence response which resembles the tnfα mediated response. specifically the chemokine/cytokines ccl7/ <dig>  cxcl3/ <dig>  spp <dig> and pdgfb were induced after  <dig> h of nacl treatment. all these chemokines, except pdgf1b, were up-regulated by tnfα as well, while only ccl <dig> was up-regulated by anisomycin. the up-regulation of chemokines and cytokines indicates that long exposure to nacl induces a late tnfα-like response necessary for cell adaptation to osmostress. a full list of genes found in each category can be accessed through the supplementary miniweb file .

discussion
the activity of p <dig> sapk is important for controlling many aspects of cell physiology and its role in gene expression regulation has been well established. for instance, the saccharomyces cerevisae p <dig> sapk orthologue hog <dig> plays a key role regulating osmostress-induced genes required for yeast adaptation to osmotic shock  <cit> . in order to shed light on the role of p <dig> sapk in genome-wide transcriptional regulation in response to stress, we have performed whole genome microarray analyses and compared three different treatments  that are able to activate p <dig> sapk, albeit with different kinetics. the three p <dig> sapk activators induced the up-regulation of a specific set of genes, with a small core set of genes being induced by all of them.

in general, genes induced by the three stimuli were found to be involved in the regulation of different biological processes. as expected, tnfα elicited immune and stress responses. on the other hand, anisomycin specifically induced genes involved in transcription repression and chemokine activity suggesting that this antibiotic partially mimics tnfα, which strongly induced several chemokines and cytokines. both nacl and anisomycin had in common the regulation of rna biogenesis whereas nacl specifically enhanced many components of the ribonucleoprotein complex, suggesting that protein translation is a key process for cell adaptation to osmostress. on top of that, osmostress also up-regulated dna associated proteins, such as histones and proteins associated to the nucleolus and the nuclear pore complex. notably, the three stimuli regulated to some extent genes involved in cell migration, proliferation and cell death. however, the major go molecular function induced by p <dig> sapk activation was the up-regulation of transcription factors.

a significant amount of up-regulated genes was dependent on p <dig> sapk, based on their diminished expression in the presence of sb <dig> and in p38α-/- cells. this raises the interesting question of how sapk activity is able to specifically up-regulate different gene programs depending on the stimuli. a plausible explanation would be that the final output results from the integration at the gene promoters of various converging signals. thus, the presence of additional activating signals would be necessary to achieve the highest transcriptional up-regulation in a given context, while inhibition of p <dig> sapk would cut one of the inputs resulting in a reduced expression. alternatively, but less likely, the different kinetics observed in the activation of p <dig> sapk might lead to the activation of a different set of genes.

it is well established as well, that p <dig> sapk controls the stability of several mrnas through a not fully understood mechanism that requires the activity of mk <dig> and the presence of au-rich elements  located at the 3' utr of specific mrnas. these sequences are involved in the recruitment of are-binding proteins that contribute to mrna stabilisation or degradation  <cit> . there are about  <dig> human mrnas containing are sequences. a high-throughput study from frevel and co-workers showed that the stability of up to  <dig> mrnas bearing are sequences were enhanced upon the treatment of the human monocytic cell line thp- <dig> with lipolysaccharide in a p <dig> sapk dependent manner  <cit> . we have crossed frevel's results with ours and found the overlapping of up to  <dig> different genes . notably, most of these genes where up-regulated by tnfα which suggests that different p <dig> sapk activators may contribute differently to mrna stabilization. moreover, we have seen that osmostress strongly up-regulated the are binding protein tpp which has been shown to suppress inflammation by accelerating the decay of cytokine mrnas upon p <dig> sapk activation  <cit> . therefore further experimental work is necessary to asses the contribution of transcription and mrna stabilization in response to stress conditions. in any case, p <dig> sapk appears to be instrumental for the proper response of a majority of genes in response to all three stimuli tested.

in yeast, there is a large conserved environmental stress response , which consists in a core of genes that respond to a diverse type of stress; such as heat shock, osmostress, oxidative stress and others  <cit> . this core of genes includes a number of stress defence genes and seem to be important for adaptation to stress. in mammals, such an esr has not been reported. interestingly, we found a small number of genes that is common to all three stress treatments and might be relevant. notably, the main enriched molecular function induced by the three treatments was the up-regulation of transcriptional modulators. thus, transcriptional regulation could be a key shared process to build up the appropriate gene response for adaptation to cell stress. moreover, the three treatments up-regulated several members of the dusp family of genes, which have mapk phosphatase activity and are known to play a key role in the down-regulation of mapk signalling  <cit> .

it is worth noting that when p <dig> sapk dependence was analysed in a time course experiment, more than 90% of the genes that responded to osmostress at  <dig> minutes were p <dig> sapk-dependent, however, after  <dig> h only 60% of the up-regulated genes required p <dig> sapk activity. thus, the sapk pathway appears to be critical at the initial response, whereas other signaling pathways are probably more relevant at later times.

regarding how cells adapt to stress over time, our go analyses revealed that the primary response to nacl addition was the up-regulation of solute and ion trans-membrane transporters as well as sensorial g-protein coupled receptors. significantly, 65% of the early genes  were shut down at later times. at the intermediate time point,  <dig> genes were specifically up-regulated and were mainly involved in the control of transcription and ribosome biogenesis. however after  <dig> h of osmostress,  <dig> genes were specifically up-regulated. these late-induced genes were mainly included in the go terms transcription factor activity, chemokine and cytokine activity, protein kinase activity, stress response, growth control and protein dephosphorylation. altogether, we conclude that on one hand, osmostress up-regulates many ion trans-membrane transporters to quickly overcome the changes in osmolarity between the extra-cellular environment and the intracellular milieu, whereas on the other hand, long exposure to osmostress promotes cell survival, growth and mediates a tnfα-like response through the up-regulation of chemokine/cytokine activities. on top of that, protein dephosphorylation is probably necessary to down-regulate p <dig> sapk activity and to shut down other signalling pathways activated at early times. notably, gene transcription is still necessary for cell adaptation at this late time point.

to date, few whole genome studies on p <dig> sapk regulated genes have been reported. an early work used primary endothelial cells treated with tnfα in the presence of sb <dig> for  <dig> h to identify tnfα-induced and p <dig> sapk dependent genes. these authors reported  <dig> tnfα-induced genes,  <dig> of which depended on p <dig> sapk to some extent  <cit> . in contrast, we have found that just after  <dig> minutes of incubation with tnfα there is a strong dependency on p <dig> sapk for gene up-regulation. this difference would be consistent with our results showing that sapk dependency decreases over time upon osmostress treatment. therefore, the genes up-regulated  <dig> h after cell stimulation observed by vienmman and co-workers may represent a late response to the cytokine, which would be driven by secondary signalling events rather than by tnfα itself. in agreement with this idea, our data shows that tnfα strongly induced the up-regulation of chemokines and cytokines that once secreted to the media may trigger a paracrine cell response leading to the activation of other signalling pathways and gene transcription programs. similarly a more recent study reported a genome wide screening using rat fibroblast-like synoviocytes also treated with tnfα. these authors reported the up-regulation of  <dig> genes by this cytokine, 30% of which were dependent on the activation of p <dig> sapk  <cit> . again the low p <dig> sapk dependency reported in this work is not surprising if we take into account that cells were harvested  <dig> h after the addition of tnfα. we have crossed-checked their tnfα up-regulated list of genes with ours and found that only six genes overlapped: cxcl <dig>  gm <dig>  csf <dig>  pde4b, phlda <dig> and ier <dig>  as discussed above, the most plausible explanation for the discrepancy with our study is probably due to the fact that we have evaluated the primary tnfα response on immediate early genes whereas zer et al reported a late tnfα-mediated gene response. on another hand, a wide genome microarray analysis performed on exponentially growing human keratinocytes treated with sb <dig> but without challenging the cells with extra-cellular stimuli has been reported. this study concluded that p <dig> sapk positively controlled genes involved in cell proliferation, keratinocyte differentiation and mapk regulation  <cit> . in agreement with our results, the authors also found the up-regulation of some dusp genes, indicating that this is likely to be an important event to down-regulate mapk activity. moreover gazel's work and ours concludes that the transcription factors c-fos and n-myc are key players of stress-mediated responses. however, the overall gene overlapping between the set of genes that we have found and that of gazel and co-workers is negligible which might be due to the fact that in such study the authors only evaluated gene regulation mediated by the p <dig> sapk basal activity. our conclusions based on transient activation of the p <dig> sapk also differ from a report using proliferating cardiomyocytes which showed that p <dig> sapk basal activity played an important role in regulating extra-cellular matrix genes through the transcription factors c/ebpβ and tef- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our work illustrates how acute and transient p <dig> sapk activation control gene expression in response to different stresses. it appears that the primary transcriptional response induced by three stimuli is highly dependent on p <dig> sapk activation, but then becomes diluted over time. as expected, tnfα induced a strong pro-inflammatory response. anisomycin, on the other hand, partially elicited a response that resembles a mild tnfα mediated response. at early times, nacl clearly up-regulated many trans-membrane transporters probably to compensate the strong change of osmolarity between the cell and the extra-cellular environment. at the middle time point, osmostress strongly enhanced the expression of many genes involved in ribosome biogenesis suggesting that de novo protein translation is fundamental for cell adaptation. at this time, we also start to see how the cells respond to stress through the up-regulation of some chemokines. this is further strengthened at later times where nacl induced a strong defence response. in addition, the osmostress-induced up-regulation of trans-membrane transporters, ribosome proteins and histones had not been previously shown. moreover, we have defined a core of  <dig> common genes, five of which are transcription factors, which are regulated by several stresses. therefore the regulation of transcriptional activity emerges as the most prominent molecular function depending on p <dig> sapk activation that is induced by the three stress stimuli.
