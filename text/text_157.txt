BACKGROUND
transposable elements  are ubiquitous components of prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes and, as a consequence of their prevalence, mobility and concomitant mutagenicity , they can induce profound changes in genome organization and have an important evolutionary impact on expression and function of host genes  <cit> . tes can lead to genome expansion and contraction  <cit> , transduction and amplification of host gene fragments  <cit>  and increase the variability of protein repertories  <cit> . given this enormous potential as a source of genetic novelty, considerable effort has been devoted by the scientific community to the characterization of new tes in the plethora of new genomes and transcriptomes available in public databases, particularly in organisms for which the knowledge about tes is scarce. while some families of tes are found across most taxa surveyed, others appear to have a restricted host distribution; the mutator system in plants was an example of the latter. this notion was recently dispelled by the identification and extensive characterization of mutator homologs in the first non-plant species  <cit> . moreover, consensus sequences of new representatives of this te family obtained from a broad range of species have been reported in repbase reports within the past few years: cemudr1- <dig> from caenoharbidtis elegans  <cit> ; mudr1-2_tp in the diatom thalassiosira pseudonana  <cit> ; mudr1-2_nv in the starlet sea anemone nematostella vectensis  <cit> ; mudr1x-2x_sm in the planarian schmidtea mediterranea  <cit>  and mudr1x-2x_ap in the insect acyrthosiphon pisum  <cit> .

the mutator  system was originally identified by robertson  <cit>  in maize as a highly mutagenic transposon system. this system is composed of diverse families that share ~ <dig> bp terminal inverted repeats  and create a  <dig> bp host sequence duplication at the insertion site . these elements can be either autonomous  or nonautonomous . transposition of mu elements is dependent of the autonomous mudr elements. the mudr element in maize is  <dig>  kb long and contains two open reading frames : mudra and mudrb. the mudra gene product, the mura protein of  <dig> amino acids, probably a transposase, contains a catalytic domain with a d34e motif  and its expression is sufficient for the somatic excision of the te  <cit> . the transposase encoded by mudra shares weak but significant similarity to those encoded by the is <dig> group of prokaryotic insertion sequences  <cit> . deletions on mudra disable the mutator transpositional activity  <cit> . the murb protein is encoded by mudrb; while this protein's function remains undetermined, it seems to be necessary for the activity of the mu system in maize  <cit> . mutator-like elements  have been identified in a wide range of plant species, such as arabidopsis  <cit> , oryza , saccharum  <cit>  and different grasses  <cit> . interestingly, mules lack the mudrb gene  <cit> . in maize, thale cress and rice mules are heterogeneous in sequence, size and structure. in particular, some elements either carry small imperfect tirs or completely lack them  <cit> .

recently, non-plant species have been reported to harbor mules. chalvet et al.  <cit>  provided the first evidence for the presence of an active mule in the fungus fusarium oxysporum, the transposon hop. it is  <dig>  bp long, has tirs of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp target site duplication , encodes a putative transposase of  <dig> amino acids and has no apparent sequence specificity at the insertion site. the presence of related elements in other filamentous fungi like magnaporthe grisae, neurospora crassa and aspergillus fumigatus has also been reported  <cit> . neuvéglise et al.  <cit>  identified a new type of dna transposons, mutyl, in the yeast yarrowia lipolytica with  <dig>  bp, imperfect tirs of  <dig> bp,  <dig> to  <dig> bp tsd, and two orfs which potentially encode proteins of  <dig> and  <dig>  amino acids. whereas the first orf shows no significant homology to described proteins, the second one shows similarity to a wide variety of mule-encoded transposases. more recently, pritham et al.  <cit>  characterized a canonical copy of the mutator-like element in a protist genome, entamoeba invadens. this element, named emule-ei <dig>  is  <dig>  bp long and displays structural features typical of plant mules, such as tirs of  <dig> bp and a  <dig> bp flanking tsd. moreover, it contains a single orf that putatively encodes a 456-aa protein that shows significant similarity to the hop transposase from f. oxysporum. in that study, homologous elements were observed in three additional entamoeba genomes, namely e. dispar, e. hystolitica and e. moshkovskii  <cit> .

trichomonas vaginalis, an asexual flagellated protist  <cit> , is an extracellular obligate human parasite of the urogenital tract  <cit>  and a member of a deep-branching eukaryotic lineage, the parabasalids  <cit> . its genome sequence and annotation, published in  <dig> by carlton and collaborators, revealed a putative set of ~ <dig> , mostly intronless, protein-coding genes, endowing t. vaginalis with one of the largest gene sets among eukaryotes  <cit> . interestingly, this genome was shown to be highly repetitive, with repeats and tes comprising about two-thirds of its ~ <dig> mb-long sequence. until now, only dna transposons have been completely characterized in this species, including mariner  <cit> , polintons  <cit> , and mavericks  <cit> . among the original repeats identified in the genome of t. vaginalis were included four repeat consensus sequences with a mutator-like profile: r <dig> with  <dig>  bp, r130a with  <dig>  bp, r <dig> with  <dig>  bp, r <dig> with  <dig>  bp  <cit> . in this report, we characterize these four t. vaginalis mutator-like elements , which we renamed as tvmule <dig> , tvmule <dig> , tvmule <dig>  and tvmule <dig> . we confirm the inclusion of the four repeats into the mutator superfamily based on sequence, structural and phylogenetic analyses. while tvmule <dig> is a member of the mudr clade predominantly from plants, the other three tvmules represent a new and quite distinct mutator lineage, expanding the taxonomic distribution and the range of functional motif of mules among eukaryotes.

RESULTS
characterization of tvmules: new t. vaginalis transposons
the sequence and structure of four mutator-like consensus sequences  <cit>  were analyzed in detail in the present study. the manual inspection of a combination of sequence similarity searches and consensus sequence building techniques  and the presence of putative, imperfect, terminal inverted repeats  resulted in the definition four new mutator-like transposable element families represented by the consensus sequence of which we termed tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  and tvmule <dig> represented by the canonical copy contained in the contig  <dig> .

all insertions of the four families were identified in the  <dig>  contigs that make up the current genome assembly of t. vaginalis by blastn. a total of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  matches revealed strong similarity to tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  respectively . all matches were extracted by blast coordinates and all orfs starting at the met residue were predicted, excepting tvmule <dig>  in which the predicted orf was only derived of the canonical copy. the four tvmules contain a single intronless gene. the more frequent orf of tvmule <dig>  which putatively encodes a 629-aa protein , displayed highest similarity  to a mutator transposase  from a. thaliana . on the other hand, the other three tvmules showed similarity to three potential mutator tpases from the pathogenic yeast candida albicans: the first of these  is 568-aa residues long and is very similar to the second c. albicans protein , which is 832-aa long; the third c. albicans protein , is 668-aa long. tvmule <dig> matched the first c. albicans protein, and tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig> showed significant similarity to the third protein with  <dig> and 43% similarity, respectively . while tvmule <dig> have relatively small non-coding regions, these extend to several hundred base pairs in tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>

within each of the four tvmule families all copies were found to be nearly identical in sequence . this result confirms the low polymorphism obtained from average pairwise differences between copies  observed by carlton et al.  <cit> . there, the π value was estimated as  <dig> % for tvmule <dig>   <dig> % for tvmule <dig>   <dig> % for both tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  within each family, the sequences of the 5' and 3' tirs are nearly identical. in addition, an alignment of these putative tirs across tvmule families shows three positions in the 5' end and six in the 3' end are nearly perfectly conserved . the presence of polymorphism in the terminal ends within each repeat family could indicate that they do not act as the transposase recognition site, given that the internal regions of different copies are more highly conserved. alternatively, it is possible that the binding is not specific across the entire tir, or that some of the mutations that have accumulated since transposition actually inactivates the respective copies.

tvmule <dig> shares recognized mule structural motifs. firstly, it has a well-conserved d34e integrase signature in the putative active site, and three residues of the transposase core conserved across a wide range of mules  <cit>  are also present . this conserved region corresponds to the ~130-aa domain identified by eisen et al.  <cit>  containing a 25-aa signature sequence . secondly, a transposase zinc finger domain at the c-terminal region was identified, which has a nearly perfect cx2cx4hx4/6c-motif . this motif is found in the nucleocapsid protein of retroviruses, in several known nucleic acid binding proteins, in the copia-like retrotransposons from tobacco  <cit> , and in ty elements in yeast  <cit> . it has been proposed that this motif plays a role in a transposase-transposon interaction that takes place during transposition and/or regulation  <cit> .

the other three tvmules  show amino acid residue contents that differ markedly from that of tvmule <dig> and from those of known plant mules. however, these elements exhibit significant similarity to three c. albicans elements . this observation is readily apparent from the quite new and distinct content of residues contained in two conserved motifs shared by these six elements . the inclusion of this extended group in the mutator superfamily is supported by a variety of structural analyses. first, the three c. albicans proteins show significant similarity to mules such as hop from f. oxysporum  and a cucumis melo mule ; in addition, one of them  contains a conserved mutator-like transposase domain corresponding to pfam <dig> , a hallmark of tpases of the mutator family. secondly, blastp generated significant pairwise alignments for all comparisons between these tvmules , as well as between them and the c. albicans sequences . thirdly, a careful characterization of motifs across  <dig> mutator elements, as well as in these t. vaginalis and c. albicans repeats, revealed that the latter encode an extended motif of  <dig> residues  identical to the 25-aa signature sequence of the mule transposase core previously mentioned . the high degree of sequence conservation of this motif  in quite distinct branches of the mutator lineage suggests that it plays a role that is essential to the fitness of the elements.

finally, none of the four tvmules encodes a mudrb product, similarly to what is observed in the a. thaliana and o. sativa  <cit> . even in plants, while mudra sequences are widespread in grasses, mudrb sequences seem to be restricted to zea  <cit> .

preferential insertion sites of tvmules
among all matches with similarity to tvmule <dig>  and tvmule <dig> , only 8%  and  <dig> % , respectively, correspond to complete copies. probably due to their longer size, which can not be spanned by two pcr reads, matches to tvmule <dig>  and to tvmule <dig>  represent only internal or end regions of the elements; these observations reflect the fragmentary nature of the current assembly, which in turn is caused by the highly repetitive character of the t. vaginalis genome. thus, the analyses of putative insertion site preferences were performed with all insertions that contain at least one end region.

the sequences flanking tvmule <dig> insertions exhibit a high degree of nucleotide conservation in the first  <dig> positions . genomic fragments of  <dig>  or  <dig> -nt adjacent to the element were extracted to evaluate the extent of such similarity in the regions flanking of different copies. the extent of the similarity between regions flanking tvmule <dig> insertions depends on the copies of this family being compared. interestingly, one pair of tvmule <dig> copies  appears to be nested within another repeat. in fact, the similarity upstream and downstream of these copies extends to  <dig> -bp and to  <dig> -bp, respectively, including putative 36-bp tirs , suggesting an unknown repeat of approximately  <dig>  bp in length. this unknown repeat is itself flanked by two different tsds . despite the fact that this full-length nested configuration is observed only in the two genomic regions mentioned above, multiple partial copies of tvmule <dig> that contain one end region are flanked by fragments of this unknown repeat. sequence similarity searches of this novel repeat against consensus sequences of trichomonas and entamoeba genera stored in repbase database, ~ <dig> repeat families identified in the t. vaginalis genome  <cit>  and genbank showed no significant matches. therefore this element remains unidentified. we hypothesize that a copy of this repeat containing an insertion of tvmule <dig> has transposed in a recent past producing multiple nested copies. however, detailed empirical studies of excision/transposition/insertion by transfection in new lineages are required to corroborate this hypothesis.

aduplication upon the chosen canonical copy;

duplication upon the insertion contained in the: bcontig  <dig> and ccontig <dig> 

tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig> are flanked by completely variable regions upstream and downstream of all insertions . curiously, multiple tsds with distinct lengths are observed, a characteristic not found in mules previously characterized . taken at face value this would suggest an extreme flexibility in their insertion sites.

finally, as the genomic distribution of these repeats is putatively the product of only self-mobilization, we assessed the preferential insertion of these tvmules relative to local gc content calculated in the first  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> -nt. the average gc content within the nearest 100-nt is  <dig> %  for tvmule <dig>   <dig> %  for tvmule <dig> and  <dig> %  for tvmule <dig>  the average gc content in the  <dig> -nt and  <dig> -nt flanking regions is slightly higher, ranging between  <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig>  for tvmule <dig>   <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for tvmule <dig>   <dig> % and  <dig> % ±  <dig> % for tvmule <dig>  respectively. this nucleotide composition is similar to that of intergenic regions in the current assembly  and considerably lower than the gc content of t. vaginalis genes , suggesting either that these two tvmule families insert preferentially in non-active regions or that insertions into genes have been eliminated by selection. this is not unexpected since almost all t. vaginalis genes are intronless and te insertions within coding regions are frequently associated to deleterious effects .

phylogenetic relationship of tvmules
three major clades of eukaryotic elements have been identified to date in the mutator superfamily:  the mudr group, characteristic of plant genomes, contains the original mutator elements identified in maize, and its relatives from arabidopsis and rice,  the hop/jittery group contains elements from a variety of host taxa including plants and fungi, and  the emule clade, which contains all elements identified in the genome of entamoeba species. members of these three clades were used to determine the phylogenetic placement of the t. vaginalis mules in the mutator superfamily, and the tree was rooted with elements belonging to the is <dig> clade of bacterial transposons. bayesian analyses showed strong support for the monophyly of the eukaryotic mutator sequences relative to the bacterial is <dig> elements . the eukaryotic clade is present in 100% of the trees in the posterior sample, a result that is confirmed by neighbor-joining  analysis . there is also strong support  for a clade containing the mudr elements. the nj analysis suggests the monophyly of the hop/jittery clade but the support from bayesian and nj bootstrap analyses is <50%. finally, the emule sequences form a strongly supported monophyletic clade . the elements from t. vaginalis are nested within the broad clade of eukaryotic mutator elements. tvmule <dig> clusters with an element from o. sativa in the mudr clade. on the other hand, tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  together with the c. albicans sequences, form a monophyletic clade present in 100% of the trees in the posterior sample of the bayesian analysis and in 85% neighbor-joining bootstrap trees. all these findings lead us to conclude that the tvmules/c. albicans clade represents a new and quite distinct branch in the mutator superfamily, which we name tvcamules.

the genetic distances within and between clades were calculated in order to determine the heterogeneity of the mules. first, the tvcamule members are more divergent regarding on the number of amino acid substitution per site  among each other  than the members of other clades . however, this higher divergence is due to difference between the members of the two species  than between c. albicans  and the tvmules  sequences. second, a pairwise comparison between clades shows that tvcamules are the most distinct from any other clade  than all other comparison pairs . these data lead us to conclude that tvcamules form a heterogeneous group and that they are distantly related to the other mules analyzed.

multiple conserved motifs in mutator and is <dig> superfamilies
forty eight mutator and is <dig> transposon sequences were used to search for sequence motifs common within this superfamily. twelve conserved motifs were identified, with motifs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> present in all sequences . interestingly, only the elements of the mudr and hop/jittery clades present the d34e active site integrase signature between motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  while the bacterial transposons show a range in the number of intervening residues in this region  . some motifs are clade-specific, such as motifs  <dig> and  <dig> in the is <dig> clade, which are similar to the mutator-like transposase domain, while others are more widespread, such as motifs  <dig> and  <dig> harbored by plants and fungi in the mudr and hop/jittery clades.

distribution and transcriptional activity of tvmules in trichomonads
the low degree of sequence polymorphism within tvmule families suggests a very recent expansion of mutator-like transposons in the t. vaginalis genome, either due to te-induced proliferation or to small-scale duplications of the host genome. to evaluate whether this expansion occurred before or after the global expansion of t. vaginalis, four t. vaginalis isolates obtained from different geographical regions were analyzed for the presence of tvmule homologs . pcr products from each sample were obtained using primer pairs from each canonical mule family of t. vaginalis . the specificity of these amplifications was confirmed by stringent dna hybridizations using as probe an internal fragment of tpase isolated of the t. vaginalis jt strain. the strong hybridization signal in all lanes suggests the presence of all tvmules in the four t. vaginalis strains tested . interestingly, homologs to the tvmules occur in other trichomonad species, even though their distribution appears to be patchy. all non-t. vaginalis isolates showed extremely weak or nearly imperceptible pcr amplification , possibly due to low copy number and/or high sequence divergence in the primer region. however, positive hybridization signals were still detected against these amplicons in some of these species . in particular, tetratrichomonas sp and t. gallinae, the two closest species to t. vaginalis examined, show evidence of tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  and of tvmule <dig>  respectively. on the contrary, the species more distantly related to t. vaginalis  <cit>  show a heterogeneous pattern. t. foetus, a parasite of the urogenital tract in cattle, shows hybridization to each of the four repeats in at least one of the strains sampled, and t. augusta, t. batrachorum, and monocercomonas sp show evidence of only tvmule <dig>  the patchy distribution among species and strains suggest extensive divergence and/or loss of elements homologous to tvmules among trichomonads.

✔ samples used in each hybridization experiments;

to verify if the tvmules are transcriptionally active, polya+ rna was extracted and cdnas synthesized from one strain from t. vaginalis  and six non-t. vaginalis species and isolates . again, rt-pcr products were obtained for each sample using the primer pairs of each element and their homology to tvmules validated by hybridization using the sequence from the jt strain of t. vaginalis as probe. the presence of abundant mrna for the four tvmules was observed in the jt strain , confirming that the four mutator elements are active transcriptionally in t. vaginalis. in contrast, the other species show no evidence of transcripts of the expected size .

discussion
transposable elements are major players in the evolution of eukaryote genomes. t. vaginalis, whose two-thirds of the genome consists of repetitive sequences, is a fascinating species to study in this context, since several topics can be explored: the discovery of new tes, their structure and origin, the dynamic of tes among related species and geographical populations, and their comparison to those characterized in other fully sequenced genomes. mutator elements are one of the most thoroughly studied plant tes  <cit> . for nearly three decades after their initial discovery by robertson  <cit>  they were thought to be present exclusively in plants. the first homologous representatives were completely characterized in the early 2000's in fungi  <cit>  and in the amoebozoa  <cit> . we have conducted a comprehensive study of four new members of the mutator superfamily in a new taxonomic group, the parabasalids, and in particular the class trichomonada, and conclude that three of the elements found are representatives of a new branch in the evolutionary history of the mutator superfamily.

this study shows that only tvmule <dig> is a typical member of the mutator superfamily, since it shows significant similarity to mutator proteins with known transposase motifs and harbors some of the hallmarks of mules. interestingly, tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig>  in addition to the presence of a conserved mutator-like transposase domain and a motif identical to the 25-aa signature sequence of the mule transposase core, also display new and distinct conserved motifs. the presence of mutator-like elements in trichomonads is not unrealistic, as the evolutionary relatedness between the maize mutator autonomous elements and the bacterial is <dig>  <cit>  shows this superfamily's ability to invade hosts across large evolutionary distances or to survive, by vertical transmission, across the spectrum of life. new mule families have already been characterized in other early divergent eukaryotes, such as in the first genomes analyzed from the genus entamoeba  <cit> . what is perhaps surprising is that it took over two decades for elements of the mutator superfamily to be identified in eukaryotic taxa other than plants. our southern blot experiments using tvmule probes strongly suggest their presence in other trichomonad species and our in silico analyses allowed their identification in the c. albicans genome.

elements similar to our repeats tvmule <dig>  tvmule <dig> and tvmule <dig> have been submitted to repbase reports, namely mudr-4_tv  <cit> , mudr-3_tv  <cit> , mudr-5_tv  <cit> , respectively. these repeats and their structures differ somewhat from those found here described in one or more of the following characteristics:  length of the elements and the peptides they encode;  length of tsds; and  copy number estimates. the differences could be due to the methods employed to determine the canonical consensus sequences.

the four tvmules each carry a putative transposase orf, which are smaller than those of known mule tpases but seem, nevertheless, to be functional since independent lines of evidence support their transpositional activity. the level of sequence divergence between copies and their respective consensus sequences  and the presence of complete copies inserted in different scaffold locations suggest that these families have undergone a recent process of activation and amplification. in addition, the set of expressed mrnas includes transcripts with high sequence similarity to these repeats. interestingly, typical mule tirs, characteristically over  <dig> bp long and the perfect inverted complement of each other, and which are supposedly necessary for mobilization, were not identified in tvmules. we hypothesize that these repeats represent of a novel type of non-tir-mules, similar to those identified in a. thaliana, which are able to transpose in the absence of long tirs  <cit> .

the large number and mobility of tvmules, much like those observed for other tes already characterized in t. vaginalis  <cit> , raise puzzling questions. what are the biological and epidemiological features that explain such high level of recent transposon activity in t. vaginalis, while these elements present a heterogeneous distribution among other trichomonads examined? could these elements have been recently introduced into t. vaginalis and, if so, where from? how do these tes contribute to the architecture and dynamics of this highly repetitive genome? what in the t. vaginalis genetic background makes this genome permissive to the high activity of these dna transposons, to the extent that they have accumulated to hundreds and even thousands of copies per family  <cit> ?

a fascinating hypothesis to explain the extraordinary expansion of tes in the genome of t. vaginalis was proposed by carlton and collaborators  <cit> . t. vaginalis, unlike most other trichomonads which are enteric, is a parasite of the human urogenital tract. a large cell size is likely advantageous in this species, since it increases its phagocytosis ability, decreases the probability of it being ingested by other organisms and host macrophages, and facilitates adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells. there is a strong, and possibly causal, correlation between genome size and cell size  <cit> . therefore, an initial stochastic expansion of te families could have given rise to the variation upon which natural selection could act, favoring the largest cells and, concomitantly, those with the largest te complement  <cit> . it is interesting to note that tritrichomonas foetus, the only other vaginal trichomonad surveyed, was the only other species in which all four tvmules were detected.

the large copy number and extremely low polymorphism of tvmules and other t. vaginalis repeats, as well as their absence in t. tenax, a parasite of the bucal cavity and the sister taxon to t. vaginalis, suggest a fast repeat expansion that has taken place in a recent evolutionary past  <cit> . the lack of homologs of the t. vaginalis repeats in t. tenax  <cit>  also raises the possibility that these elements have been recently acquired through horizontal transfer, a phenomenon that is relatively more common than was once believed, and which is possibly an essential step in the life-cycle of successful class ii transposable elements  <cit> . here we found evidence for the presence of some tvmule homologs in some of the species surveyed. in particular, only tvmule <dig> shows a strong hybridization signal in t. gallinae, the closest species to t. vaginalis examined in this study, while homologs to the other three tvmule families are present in more distantly related species. the possibility remains that these repeats could have been lost from some species, or that the pcr primers used did not amplify existing divergent homologous repeats, an issue that can only be solved with an extensive genomic survey of the family trichomonadidae.

transposable elements have undeniably played a major role in the expansion of eukaryotic genomes, a phenomenon well documented in plants  <cit> , arthropods  <cit>  and vertebrates  <cit> . rapid genome expansions due to bursts of te amplification, similar to what is observed in t. vaginalis, have also been postulated for a variety of organisms  <cit> . what sets t. vaginalis apart is the fact that it is an asexual species, which, like all other trichomonads, reproduces by longitudinal binary fission. it has been argued that transposons are unable to persist in the long term in clonal lineages because the mechanisms that keep te copy number in check in sexual species, and that thereby prevent excessive mutational loads, are absent in asexual lineages  <cit> . in addition, once lost, they cannot be reintroduced by sexually-mediated genetic transfer  <cit> . given the recency of the te expansion in t. vaginalis, their long-term effect on the survival of the species is as yet unclear. it is possible that, with each te family expansion, this species is steadily proceeding to extinction.

CONCLUSIONS
the remarkably recent common ancestry of each te family in the t. vaginalis genome is attested to by the high copy number and nearly complete within-family sequence similarity of these tvmules, features that are shared with the other ~ <dig> repeat families identified in the t. vaginalis genome. the structure of each repeat, inferred from the consensus of all copies within a family, is therefore likely to reflect with high accuracy the ancestral sequence of each original active element. this makes the genome sequence of t. vaginalis is an ideal mining ground for new transposable elements, which sequence and structure have not yet been adulterated by the accumulation of inactivating mutations.
