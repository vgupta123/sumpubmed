BACKGROUND
tobacco smoke  is the leading cause of premature preventable death worldwide. smoking kills nearly  <dig> million over the world with  <dig>  deaths in united states alone  <cit> . smoking attributable deaths have been largely associated to the pathogenesis of several complications such as cancer, ischemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease   <cit> . however, equally significant but often neglected are the effects of chronic smoking on the onset and progression of several neurological and neurovascular complications such as alzheimer’s disease, multiple sclerosis and cerebral stroke . although epidemiological studies establish cigarette smoking as a major risk factor for the onset and progression of these diseases; till date the precise mechanisms underlying these irreversible deleterious changes to the brain and brain vasculatures are poorly understood.

tobacco smoke consist of several thousand toxic compounds  capable of inducing oxidative stress and vascular inflammation triggering several pathophysiological changes in peripheral vasculatures  <cit> . specifically to the blood brain barrier ; we have clearly demonstrated that  ts can degrade membrane expression of essential tight junction  proteins such as zo- <dig> and occludin;  it can induce a vascular inflammatory response in bbb endothelial cells  via release of interleukin- <dig>  and matrix metalloproteinase- <dig> ;  it can up-regulate vascular adhesion molecules such as vascular adhesion molecule- <dig>  and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- <dig> . all together, the data clearly suggest that ts can severely impair and compromise bbb integrity and function .

moreover, we have also clearly demonstrated that oxidative stress is one of the cardinal determinants of ts induced bbb toxicity where the extent of bbb damage positively correlates with the oxidative capacity of the ts product tested. several reduced exposure ‘light’ versions of tobacco products are currently available in market that claim to be safe solely on the reduction of nicotine or a few selected toxicants. profiling of ts showed a significant release of reactive oxygen , hydrogen peroxide content and reactive nitrogen species  in the nicotine-free  and ultralow nicotine products along with the full flavor products. as the level of tar, h2o <dig> and nitric oxide content increased; ts induced bbb toxicity increased proportionally along with the level of pro-inflammatory activity and oxidative stress.

thus we further investigated the role of oxidative stress and anti-oxidant mechanisms  activated at the bbb endothelium in response to ts exposure. this is one of the main protective mechanisms triggered to counteract oxidative insult such as those elicited by ts  <cit> .

although microarray based gene expression studies investigating ts induced global changes in cellular transcriptome have been previously reported in human bronchial epithelium, oral mucosa and peripheral immune cells ; the effect of ts on bbb endothelium has only be marginally addressed and even more so at the level of gene expression and transcription. moreover, a comprehensive study focussing on ts activated anti-oxidant mechanisms at the bbb is still lacking. in this study we addressed this critical issue using human bbb endothelial cells   <cit>  chronically exposed to various ts related products over a period of 24 h. nrf <dig> expression and its downstream pathway targets were also assessed and correlated with respect to oxidative and/or inflammatory potential of the specific tobacco product.

for this purpose, we performed a side-by-side comparative analysis of antioxidant mechanisms triggered by nicotine exposure against soluble cigarette smoke extracts  from:  regular full flavor cigarette  and  reduced exposure ultra-low nicotine cigarette . about  <dig>  gene targets were screened in a microarray based gene expression studies. positive hits from the gene array data were investigated further using real time pcr  and western blot analysis  as well as ad hoc functional studies. in summary, our work provides an in depth detailed analysis of the bbb counteractive cellular mechanisms triggered by realistic exposure to ts.

RESULTS
cse increases oxidative stress load and nrf <dig> nuclear translocation in bbb endothelium
main and side stream ts contain high levels of toxic reactive aldehydes and pro-oxidants that are shown to destabilize the cellular redox balance. we assessed the impact of ts generated from different tobacco products, on cellular ros levels  in bbb endothelium using cellrox® green reagent. as shown in figure 1a, exposure to cse from both full flavor  and uln cigarettes rapidly increased endothelial ros , with greater intensity of fluorescence, compared to control. in comparison, exposure to nicotine elicited only a mild oxidative response .figure  <dig> cse exposure potentiates oxidative stress responses in bbb endothelial cells. briefly, confluent hcmec/d <dig> cell monolayers were exposed to media containing nicotine only  or cses from full flavor  or uln tobacco products containing nicotine equivalent to 100 ng/ml). fresh media without nicotine or mainstream ts served as controls. a immunofluorescence analysis of cellular ros levels  were determined by using cellrox® green reagent following exposure to cse or nicotine treatment ; b gene array based analysis of nrf <dig> gene expression changes was determined after control, nicotine or ts exposure ; c nrf <dig> mrna expression was quantified by rt-pcr using primer specific sequences ; d nrf <dig> expression and nuclear translocation following exposure to different conditions at early time point of 8 h as analyzed by western blotting. representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig>  vs. control.



next, we determined the effects of ts on endothelial nrf <dig> expression and its nuclear translocation . nrf <dig> is a redox-sensitive transcription factor and a master regulator of cellular redox homeostasis. it has been demonstrated that increased levels of ros trigger the activation and subsequent nuclear translocation of nrf <dig>  this ultimately triggers the expression/activation of various molecular networks primarily involved in cellular cytoprotection against oxidative and inflammatory stress  <cit> . to this end, our data showed modest increase in nrf <dig> gene expression levels in response to cse from 3r4f and uln cigarettes . however, nrf <dig> transcription assessed by rt-pcr was significant in bbb endothelial cells exposed to uln-derived cse  but not in cultures exposed to cse derived from 3r4f cigarettes  interestingly, nrf <dig> nuclear translocation  was statistically significant in bbb ecs exposed to either uln and 3r4f cigarette extracts. nicotine exposure did not affect nrf <dig> gene expression  nor nrf <dig> transcription  or its nuclear translocation . this further supports its relatively modest impact on cellular oxidative stress levels observed in figure 1a.

cse up-regulates nrf2-are dependent phase i detoxification genes
as shown in figure 2a, both microarray and rt-pcr analyses revealed a significant induction of nqo <dig> gene  both by 3r4f and uln products , but not nicotine. accordingly, exposure to 3r4f and uln upregulated nqo <dig> protein expression as demonstrated by immunofluorescence and western blotting . notably, the up-regulation of nqo <dig> expression by uln was comparable to that achieved by 3r4f.figure  <dig> effects of cse on phase i detoxification genes. hcmec/d <dig> cells were exposed to nicotine or cse from different products . effects of cse and nicotine on nqo- <dig> mrna and protein expression were characterized by: a <dig> gene array analysis; a <dig> real-time rt-pcr; b immunofluorescence and western blot analyses of nqo- <dig> protein. representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig>  vs. control. n = 6/biological replicates/condition.



cse exposure augments transcription of phase i cytochrome p450s detoxification genes
cytochrome p <dig>  family related enzymes provide additional layer of counter-regulatory anti-oxidant response through metabolism-based detoxification of toxic chemicals  <cit> . although there is no specific report of cyp51a <dig> with respect to smoke toxicants, cyp2s <dig> has been reported to scavenge xenobiotics especially carcinogens present in ts  <cit> . as shown in figure 3a, we observed a striking up-regulation in the gene expression of the cyp enzymes cyp2s <dig>  which was also confirmed by rt-pcr . cyp51a <dig> gene expression was also up-regulated however; the measured changes were statistically significant only for bbb endothelial cultures exposed to uln but not for 3r4f-derived cse . corresponding rt-pcr measurements of the gene transcription showed only a modest increased but not to a significant level in either case. note also that none of the changes in either gene expression or gene transcription for both enzymes failed to translate in a corresponding increase in protein expression . no effect at any level  was observed in response to nicotine exposure.figure  <dig> effects of cse on phase i cytochrome p450s detoxification genes. as mentioned earlier, hcmec/d <dig> cell monolayers were exposed to nicotine  or cse derived from 3r4f or uln cigarettes. following exposure for 24 h, expression of cyps-cyp2s <dig> and cyp51a <dig> was analyzed by a dna microarray, b real time pcr for mrna; and c protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control; data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig>  vs. control. n =  <dig> biological replicates/condition.



cse alters the efflux activity but not the expression of bbb p-glycoprotein
blood brain barrier endothelial cells are highly enriched with polarized expression of atp-binding cassette superfamily of drug efflux transporters such as p-glycoprotein  that prevent the brain penetration and accumulation of toxic substances including xenobiotics. previous studies have shown that nrf <dig> activation induces the transcription of major drug efflux transporters  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  microarray analysis revealed a significant up-regulation of two major abc efflux transporters, p-glycoprotein  and multidrug resistant protein- <dig>  in response to 3r4f exposure. the biological effect is consistent with a marked increase in rhodamine <dig> efflux  used as a measure of p-gp functional activity. cse from uln also increased the gene expression of p-gp , but not that of mrp <dig> . however, rt-pcr and western blotting analysis of the cellular membrane fractions did not show a corresponding increase in gene transcription and/or protein expression levels for either of these transporters . interestingly, when compared to nicotine, ts did produce a statistically significant increase of p-gp transcription when compared to nicotine since surprisingly nicotine caused a modest reduction in p-gp transcription when compared to controls.figure  <dig> effects of cse on abc efflux transporter expression and functionality in hcmec/d <dig> cell line. cells were exposed to nicotine  or cse derived from 3r4f or uln cigarettes. a p-gp efflux activity was determined by intracellular accumulation of rhodamine <dig>  efflux, as an indirect correlate of p-gp activity n = 3/condition and replicated twice. b transcriptome analysis of abc efflux transporters, abcb <dig>  and abcc <dig>  following treatment ; c rt-pcr analysis of mrna expression of p-gp and abcc <dig> in hcmec/d <dig> cells ; western blot analysis of transporter protein expression . representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , vs. control.



cse potentiates synthesis and activity of various antioxidants in bbb endothelial cells
the next major component of the nrf2-are pathway is the anti-oxidant system. in this study, we compared the effects of cse derived from conventional and reduced exposure products on the genes involved in synthesis of major anti-oxidant glutathione , such as glutathione cysteine ligase and slc7a <dig>  <cit> . genome wide transcriptional profiling revealed an amplified gene expression of gcl-modifier unit  and slc7a <dig> in bbb endothelial cells exposed to cse from 3r4f and uln . these results were further validated by rt-pcr analysis indicating a potential up-regulation of slc7a <dig>  and gclm transcription  by 3r4f and uln smoke extracts, respectively. moreover, alterations in the protein expression of slc7a <dig> and gclm followed a similar trend with significant increase upon exposure to cse derived from both products . in addition, 3r4f but not uln moderately increased gene transcription of gcl-catalytic subunit , while gclc protein expression was up-regulated by both products to a similar extent . by contrast, nicotine did not produced any significant alterations in gclm and slc7a <dig> gene expression, although we observed a marked increase in the cytoplasmic expression of the catalytic and modifier subunits of gcl following nicotine exposure, as shown by western blotting . importantly, all the tested products  reduced the turn-over rate of cellular gsh, as demonstrated by the gsh/gssg ratio . this clearly suggests a depletion of cellular antioxidant protection against incumbent oxidative stress load caused by the exposure to smoke extracts and nicotine .figure  <dig> effects of cse on gsh based antioxidant system. a microarray studies revealed an up-regulation in gene expression of two major genes involved in gsh synthesis, slc7a <dig> and gclm; b quantitative assessment using real-time pcr and western blot analyses confirm microarray analysis. c mrna expression of modifier and catalytic subunits of glc and protein expression of gclc and gclm following cse exposure derived from 3r4f and uln products including nicotine. representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control; d gsh/gssg ratio was determined using thiol green reagent, as mentioned in the methods section. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig>  vs. control. n =  <dig> biological replicates/condition.



continuing on the same path, we assessed the effects of nicotine, 3r4f and uln exposure on gene expression, transcription and translation of heme oxygenase . hmox- <dig> is also a component of the cellular antioxidant cytoprotective mechanisms along with other molecular networks   <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, transcriptome analysis revealed a significant increase in the gene expression levels of hmox- <dig> and other anti-oxidant molecules in response to 3r4f and uln exposure. results were corroborated by rt-pcr and western blot analyses in line with gene expression data as shown in figure 6b, c respectively . immunofluorescence analysis of the bbb endothelial monolayers further supports these observations .figure  <dig> effects of cse exposure  on bbb endothelial gene and protein expression of hmox <dig>  a several genes belonging to hmox- <dig> and heme recycling were up-regulated following cse exposure of ts products. nicotine did not produce any change in these genes; b real time rt-pcr showed up-regulation of hmox- <dig> protein expression following exposure to full flavor, and uln cses; c western blot analyses of cellular membrane fractions corroborate with mrna changes showing statistically significant up-regulation in protein expression; representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control; d immunofluorescence analysis of hmox <dig> expression. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig>  vs. control. n =  <dig> biological replicates/condition.



cse increases nf-κβ expression and nuclear translocation
we next determined the impact of ts and nicotine on the p <dig> subunit of nfκb  gene expression, a transcriptional factor and potential activator of oxidative and inflammatory stress pathways  <cit> . as shown in figure 7a <dig>  the mrna expression of nfκb-p <dig> was markedly elevated by cse exposure of both products with uln producing a stronger response in 3r4f. we also observed a significant increase in the activation and nuclear translocation of nfκb-p <dig> following exposure to either 3r4f or uln smoke extracts . as shown in figure 7a <dig>  the cytoplasm/nuclear ratio of nfκb-p <dig> in bbb endothelial cultures exposed to 3r4f or uln smoke extracts was only 50% of that measured in controls. by contrast, nicotine exposure alone did altered neither the mrna expression nor the nuclear translocation of nfκb-p <dig> .figure  <dig> cse exposure of various ts products induces inflammatory stress in bbb ecs. a <dig> mrna expression of nfκb-p <dig> in hcmec/d <dig> cells following exposure to nicotine, cse from both tobacco products; a <dig> western blot analysis of cytosolic and nuclear fractions of nfκb-p <dig> showed increased protein expression and nuclear localization following cses; representative western blots were shown with actin as a loading control; a <dig> the translocation status could be better understood via ratio of cytosolic versus nuclear nfκb-p <dig> plotted in terms of percent control; b release of chemokines such as il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> from hcmec/d <dig> cell cultures as determined by elisa; c vegf release was up-regulated in endothelial cultures exposed to full flavor and uln cse but not nicotine. data were expressed as mean ± sem . *p <  <dig> , **p <  <dig> , ***p <  <dig> , ****p <  <dig>  vs. control. n =  <dig> biological replicates/condition.



secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin  <dig>  and the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein- <dig>  are in agreement with nfκb-p <dig> activation . both cse from 3r4f and uln cigarette products amplified the il- <dig> secretory response by tenfold compared to control cultures . nicotine  was also found to significantly elevate the release of il- <dig> from bbb endothelial cells , although the magnitude of nicotine’s effects was relatively very low when compared to cses . in addition, release of vascular endothelial growth factor , a known modulator of vascular angiogenesis, was also significantly increased in response to the exposure to 3r4f and uln-derived cse . nicotine treatment alone was also found to induce the endothelial secretion of mcp- <dig> and vegf by a marginal  <dig>  fold over control .

discussion
the role of nrf <dig> dependent antioxidant response pathway is well established in disorders aggravated by cigarette smoke such as lung emphysema, copd, atherosclerosis and cardiac dysfunction . in these disorders nrf <dig> deficiency has clearly been demonstrated to increase the susceptibility to cellular toxicity  <cit>  and several natural and/or synthetic antioxidant based supplemental therapies have proven to be beneficial in ameliorating the oxidative damage  <cit> .

in this study we assessed the activity and biological responses of the human bbb endothelium to a number of biological factors related to nrf <dig> activation. the endpoint goal of this work was to unravel  the cause–effect relationship between the oxidative potential of full flavor  and “reduced exposure”  tobacco products and the biological response of these cells.

as expected the biological response of the bbb endothelium in respect to nrf <dig> expression/activity supported our original hypothesis of a direct correlation between the oxidative potential of a tobacco product and its cellular toxicity. this is clearly shown in figure  <dig> demonstrating a striking relationship between oxidative stress generated by the cse extracts on cultured endothelial cells  and the effect on the expression level and nuclear translocation of nrf <dig> in the same cells . a data that already argue with the notion of “reduced exposure” tobacco product  being intrinsically less harmful than conventional cigarettes . our results also indicate that cigarette reduction in nicotine content has a negligible or at best a very modest effect on the overall “safety” of the product itself in terms of oxidative damage to cells and tissues.

nrf2-dependent anti-oxidant response is mainly divided into detoxification enzymes  and anti-oxidant based system   <cit> . as a follow up study, we performed transcriptome analysis to screen for the expression of several downstream targets of nrf2-dependent antioxidant response. nrf <dig> dependent downstream genes were also highly up-regulated in response to cse exposure whereas nicotine did not bear any significant effect. specifically, a number of phase i detoxification genes depending upon nrf2/are pathway activation were up-regulated including nqo <dig> . nqo <dig> is a cytoplasmic 2-electron reductase that prevents the reduction of quinones and the resulting production of radical species. nqo <dig> response to cse exposure was observed at the gene expression, transcription and protein expression levels . taken together, we show that the both conventional and “reduced exposure” tobacco products  elicit a strong oxidative stress response in bbb endothelial cells that well correlate with nrf <dig> activation also elicited by cse exposure.

expression of phase i cytochrome p450s genes such as cyp2s <dig> and cyp51a <dig> were also up-regulated by exposure to cse from both cigarette products although a corresponding increase in protein expression was not evident . this could be possibly due to a longer time requirement for the gene expression changes to translate into measurable alteration of protein expression. important to note however, is that very few studies have reported strong baseline expression of cyps in normal bbb endothelium  <cit> . thus, a distinct pattern of gene up-regulation of both cyp2s <dig> and cyp51a <dig> which have been observed in response to ts detoxification is a relevant piece of information further supporting the involvement of nrf <dig> -dependent cytoprotection in response to ts exposure .

another important component of bbb is the class of abc transporters that function to efflux out both endogenous and exogenous toxicants out of the brain. as shown in figure 4a, our data provides novel evidence of a potential augmentation of two classical abcs, abca <dig>  and abcc <dig>  at the bbb in response to cse exposure. these changes were tangible enough to show at the gene expression level however were too small to be detected to a significant level of confidence at the transcription and translation level. nevertheless functional assessment of an assessment of functional efflux activity specifically for p-gp  clearly demonstrated statistically significant higher efflux function in ec cultures exposed to 3r4f. uln effect was more modest. considering that nicotine mildly down-regulated p-gp gene expression and did not affect its efflux activity, the difference between 3r4f and uln in respect to p-gp activity can possibly reflect a difference in cigarette composition and substances released in solution which may differently affect p-gp expression. this provided a reasonable explanation  where again the total oxidative capacity of the ts product was the determining factor of cellular toxicity and activation of cytoprotective mechanisms. in addition to these major drug efflux transporters, gene array screening revealed up-regulation of several other abc transporters primarily involved in cholesterol trafficking across the bbb .

the next level of cytoprotection provided by nrf2-are pathway is the heightened synthesis of anti-oxidants such as gsh, thioredoxin. exposure to cse from 3r4f and uln both elicited gene transcription and increase in the protein expression levels of the cystine/glutamate transporter antiporter slc7a <dig> and the glutamate cysteine ligase regulatory subunit  which is the first rate limiting enzyme of glutathione  synthesis . note, in fact, how the gsh//gssg rate reflects the level of oxidative stress caused by ts exposure leading to gsh depletion . note also the nicotine is capable in some measure to elicit oxidative stress. this is also reflected in the more modest but still significant decrease of gsh/gssg ratio observed in bbb endothelial cells exposed to nicotine. although the effect is relatively modest, this can explain while 3r4f exposure determined the most significant impact in terms of gsh reduction when compared to uln product. uln contain similar amount of tar but negligible amount of nicotine. in addition, concomitant up-regulation of several other genes related to napdh production were also observed. . these genes function to recycle and regenerate the anti-oxidants back to the inactive state  <cit> .

oxidative and inflammatory changes following ts exposure have been reported to elevate stress inducible enzyme hmox- <dig>  <cit> . both 3r4f and uln products showed comparable alterations in hmox- <dig>  and related genes . interestingly, apart from metal chelation; pirin is also reported to govern the activation of nfκβ and its related genes via nrf <dig>  <cit> . it is a non heme fe protein that may function to sense redox stress for the nfκβ pro-inflammatory signalling and govern the expression of downstream genes involved in immune responses  <cit> . ferritin instead is a major intracellular storage protein which helps with iron homeostasis. it is usually composed of various ratios of light chain and heavy chain subunits. following cse treatment we observed increased transcription of several of these subunits whereas, both 3r4f and uln products led to the activation of genes related to iron sequestration. in contrast, nicotine failed to induce any changes in gene and/or protein expression of hmox- <dig>  this again reiterated that the level of bbb toxicity was dependent on the oxidative and/or inflammatory capacity of the ts product which may not be discriminated by the nicotine content alone.

apart from nrf <dig>  another cell survival transcription factor reported in event of oxidative stress is nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated b cells ; a protein complex that controls dna transcription and is involved in cellular responses to harmful stimuli  and plays a key role in regulating the immune and cell survival  <cit> . nfκb-p <dig> not only increased in total cytosolic levels, but also showed increased translocation into the nucleus  in response to cse exposure. apart from classical activation of nfκβ in events of inflammatory/oxidative stress, nrf1/nrf <dig> can up-regulate gclc transcription indirectly via modulation of levels of nfκβ  <cit> . although based on current results we cannot assertively state if nfκb-p <dig> was directly or indirectly activated; we observed a significant increase of its nuclear translocation following cse exposure. the effect was particularly enhanced in response to uln-derived cse; a cigarette product considered “reduced exposure” and less harmful than conventional products. in addition, nfκβ-p <dig> expression and translocation patterns consistently paralleled stress fighting responses as reported in earlier observations. nfκβ activation typically involves either canonical or non-canonical pathways. the selection dependents on whether p50/p <dig>   or p52/relb  is involved in the translocation and downstream activation. we could clearly observe increased translocation of the p <dig> sub unit into the nucleus indicating activation of the canonical pathway and associated pro-inflammatory/cell survival responses. at this point, it is difficult assert if only this pathway was associated with the ts toxicity coping mechanisms; further studies will be required in future to specifically address this conundrum. furthermore, we observed an increase of il- <dig> release following both 3r4f and uln-derived cse exposures. in agreement with our findings, p <dig> sub unit was reported to activate il- <dig> expression via promoter binding  <cit> .

interestingly, previous in vitro studies by barr et al.  <cit>  have shown a dose dependent nicotine-induced activation of stress-dependent nfkb pathway in mesencephalic cells. however, we observed only a marginal response to nicotine exposure . a possible explanation of this discrepancy could be attributed to two factors:  for our experiments the reference concentration of nicotine used was approximately  <dig>  µm which falls to the lower end of the concentrations tested by barr and co-workers;  time of assessment. in our study, oxidative stress measurements  were measured at 3 h at which point we did note a slight increase of oxidative stress in nicotine-exposed cultures versus controls. however, measurements of downstream effects such as nfkb-p <dig> activation  were assessed at 24 h post exposure. it is possible that the oxidative stress effects elicited by nicotine fade off and became negligible at that time point.

as a part of vascular inflammation; cigarette-toxicity can lead to the up-regulation of several chemokines that promote cellular adhesion of white blood cells and facilitate their extravasation across the brain vasculature  <cit> . to understand the extent of vascular inflammation produced in the ecs following cse exposure; we measured two major chemokines . both these chemokines have been reported to be involved in the chemotaxis of neutrophils and monocytes after cigarette smoke exposure in lung and other peripheral vasculatures . release of il- <dig> and mcp- <dig> was significantly increased in bbb endothelial cultures exposed to cse . this is in agreement with earlier published results by our group demonstrating a number of inflammatory changes  in bbb ecs exposed to ts  <cit> . finally, cse from both 3r4f and uln elicited endothelial release of vegf, a known modulator of vascular angiogenesis released in response to hypoxic condition and implicated in the alteration of bbb vascular integrity  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this novel study provides a detailed understanding of nrf2- related cytoprotective mechanisms activated in response to ts exposure and effectively correlate them with their oxidative and inflammatory potential. whole soluble components present in cse and not nicotine seems to be the primary determinant of vascular toxicity. however, the identity of these specific compounds remains still elusive. given the extremely large number of compounds contained in cigarette smoke, the identification of the specific toxicant  responsible for the effects noted above  will be extraordinarily difficult to assess. in respect to our results as well as previous studies by our group and others, it is plausible that the oxidative stress stimuli generated by chronic ts exposure can effectively overwhelm the nrf <dig> and nfκβ-dependent cytoprotective endothelial mechanisms. this can ultimately lead to impairment of bbb function and integrity thus promoting cerebrovascular and cns disorders. it is in fact well known that  chronic smokers suffer from antioxidant shortage  caused by increased anti-oxidative mobilization in response to systemic oxidative stress evoked by ros-enriched ts  <cit> ;  antioxidant supplementation reduces the ts-dependent oxidation and inflammation in animals and cells  <cit> ;  cigarette smoking facilitate the development of a pro-atherosclerotic environment by inducing inflammation  from abcam; rabbit mrp- <dig> , mouse nqo <dig> , rabbit slc7a11# <dig>  rabbit hmox- <dig> # <dig>  nfkb p <dig> # <dig> from cell signaling technology ; mouse gclc #wh0002729m <dig>  mouse gclm #wh0002730m, rabbit cyp2s <dig> #sab <dig>  rabbit cyp51a <dig> , β-actin #a <dig> from sigma-aldrich ; mouse p-gp from calbiochem ; donkey anti-rabbit  and sheep anti-mouse  hrp-linked secondary antibodies from ge healthcare ; mouse anti-claudin  <dig> , goat anti-rabbit  and anti-mouse  conjugated to alexa fluor®  <dig> and  <dig> from invitrogen . sterile culture ware was obtained from fisher scientific , while other reagents and chemicals were purchased from sigma-aldrich  or bio-rad laboratories .

ts preparation
we followed a standardized iso/ftc standard smoking protocol , using a single cigarette smoking machine  to prepare our cigarette smoke extracts  as previously detailed elsewhere  <cit> .  <dig> puffs per cigarette were bubbled directly into phosphate buffered saline . three cigarettes per preparation were used to make 3× concentration  stock solution which was then diluted to the desired concentration. two types of cigarettes were used for this study:  full flavor cigarettes  equivalent to conventional full flavor brands containing  <dig>  mg tar and  <dig>  mg nicotine per cigarette;  ultralow nicotine spectrum cigarettes  equivalent to ultralow nicotine brands containing  <dig>  mg nicotine and 9 mg tar per cigarette. tar content of these cigarettes is similar to that of 3r4f  but that of nicotine is negligible.

cell culture
the hcmec/d <dig> cells donated by dr. couraud   were seeded on collagen coated cell culture flasks  and maintained at 37°c with 5% co <dig> in ebm- <dig> basal medium  supplemented with 5% fbs , fibroblast growth factor , chemically defined lipid concentrate , antibiotic/antimycotic . medium was changed once after 2 days and then every other day until cells formed a continuous confluent monolayer. bbb endothelial monolayers were then chronically exposed  to a final 5% cse concentration  <cit>  derived from freshly prepared smoke extracts diluted in ebm- <dig> culture media. following cse exposure cells were processed for rna and protein collection. please note that a 5% cse final concentration  yields a nicotine output of ≈100 ng/ml, which is comparable to the steady state blood nicotine concentration measured in an average chronic smoker  . experiments related to nicotine exposure as a standalone agent where performed by directly diluting nicotine in the culture media at the desired concentration .

microarray analysis
total rna was extracted using rnaeasy kit  according to manufacturer’s instructions. the rna concentration and purity was determined using nanodrop nd- <dig>  before sending the samples boston children’s hospital for further microarray analysis. a total of 100 ng of rna was required for the hybridization along with appropriate quality control  samples. illumina human ht- <dig> expression bead chip was utilized for the hybridization of samples on the chip . raw data in the form of signal intensities for each gene probe were screened, filtered and converted into fold change values over control.

real-time pcr
rneasy mini kit  was used for the extraction of total rna from bbb endothelial cell cultures. briefly, cells were lysed using rlt buffer and homogenized using a qia shredder. the total rna was then extracted from the lysate as per the manufacturer’s guidelines. further, samples were analyzed by nanodrop nd- <dig> for quantity and purity . a 20-μl first-strand cdna synthesis reaction was performed using superscript iii  and 5 μg of total rna. 1μl of resulting cdna was used in a pcr reaction of 25 μl containing 2 μl of each primer . primer pairs used in amplification have been detailed out in additional file 1: table s <dig>  amplification was performed using a bio-rad cfx <dig> touch™ real-time pcr detection system. the relative expression changes of the target genes i was then determined by ΔΔct method  <cit> , wherein target gene expression  was normalized against the house keeping gene .

western blotting
proteins was collected and fractionated using subcellular protein fractionation kit for cultured cells  according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. protein was quantified using pierce bca protein assay kit  and then denatured at 95°c for 5 min using sample buffer. denatured samples  were subjected to sds-page  and then transferred to pvdf membranes  for further blotting. these pvdf membranes were blocked for 2 h using 5% non-fat dry milk in tris buffered saline  containing  <dig> % tween- <dig>  and subsequently incubated overnight with mouse  or rabbit  primary antibodies. this was followed by four ttbs washes  and subsequent incubation with anti-rabbit or anti-mouse  hrp-conjugated secondary antibodies for 2 h. after four ttbs washes of 10 min each, the blots were developed using chemiluminescence detection method . membranes were subsequently stripped and probed for other proteins. ms β-actin  was used as a loading control. band densities were analyzed by licor software, normalized to actin and expressed as fold change over control protein expression.

immunofluorescence analysis
cells were cultured in a two-well chamber slides for ifc analysis. cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde  after period of 24 h. the slides were then washed with pbs, 5 min each for a total of three washes. this was followed by blocking with 5% goat serum  in pbs at room temperature for 50 min. fixed cells were then incubated with primary antibodies  at 4°c overnight. after pbs washes, cells were incubated for 1 h at rt with alexa fluor®  <dig> conjugated goat anti-rabbit or alexa fluor®  <dig> conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary  antibodies. after three washes with pbs , cells were rinsed, air dried and mounted with dapi in prolonged gold anti-fade mounting media . they were left for overnight drying in the dark before imaging with evos digital inverted fluorescence microscope. cells stained with secondary antibodies alone were used as negative controls.

gsh/gssg ratio in bbb endothelial cell cultures was determined using gsh/gssg ratio detection assay kit   according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. the samples were prepared by lysis of total cell protein in t-per lysis buffer followed by a dilution of 1: <dig> for gsh analysis. in brief, serial dilution of gsh and gssg stock standards were prepared along with assay mixtures for detection of gsh and total gsh using 100× thiol green stock solutions, assay buffer and gssg probe. a one- step fluorimetric reaction of sample with respective assay buffers were incubated for 30 min. fluorescence intensity was then monitored at ex/em of 490/520 nm. gssg was determined by subtracting gsh from total gsh. finally ratio of gsh was plotted against gssg to obtain the gsh activity.

statistical analyses
data from microarray as well as proteomic studies were expressed as fold changes over control ± standard error of mean . the data from all four groups were analyzed by t test or one-way anova using graphpad prism software inc. . post hoc multiple comparisons were conducted using tukey’s test. p values ≤ <dig>  were considered statistically significant.
