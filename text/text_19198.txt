BACKGROUND
human telomeres are ttaggg repeats at the ends of human chromosomes, protecting them from end-to-end fusion and maintaining chromosomal stability  <cit> . in human somatic cells, telomere length shortens in each cell division as dna polymerase is unable to replicate the very end of telomere  <cit> . eventually cells stop proliferating and undergo senescence. however, almost 90% of human cancers overcome the finite divisional potential by reactivation of a ribonucleoprotein complex, known as telomerase  <cit> . the catalytic subunit of telomerase, telomerase reverse transcriptase , is the rate-limiting factor of telomerase activity. up-regulation of htert confers cells limitless proliferative potential, which is one of the cancer hallmarks  <cit> .

emerging evidence suggests that maintenance of telomere length might not the sole function of htert during oncogenesis. for instance, knockdown of htert resulted in rapid inhibition of cell proliferation and growth in cancer cells without affecting the telomere length  <cit> . moreover, overexpressing htert in mice with long telomeres attributed to increase risk of cancer formation  <cit> , which further support the notion that htert has other functions, on top of its canonical function in telomere maintenance. in addition, human cells utilize alternative lengthening of telomeres pathway for telomere maintenance can only be transformed when co-expressing htert and oncogenic-ras, indicating that htert is indispensable for cancer transformation  <cit> . taken together, these findings suggest that htert plays a key role in tumorigenesis independent of its canonical function. its roles in neoplastic transformation, however, are still not well understood. therefore, investigating the roles of htert in the cancer transformation is of utmost imperative.

neoplastic transformation can be achieved by in vitro genetic manipulation. studies showed that disruption of the intracellular pathways regulated by sv <dig> large-t, oncogenic ras and htert are sufficient to create a human tumor cell  <cit> . this highlighted the various pathways that require changes for transformation to occur: the mitogenic response pathway activated by ras  <cit> ; telomere maintenance pathway by htert  <cit> ; cell surveillance pathways due to the functional abolishment of p <dig> and rb tumor-suppressors by large-t  <cit> . since disruption of these cellular pathways are commonly seen in in vivo tumors, tumor cells generated from such transformed cell model can be a good representation of actual human cancers  <cit> . this model also serves as a platform to study the early stages of the tumor formation, as compared to tumor biopsies that are often obtained at an advanced stage  <cit> .

here, we transformed imr <dig>  a non-epithelial somatic lung fibroblast, by three factors, including h-ras, sv <dig> large-t, and htert . using the rsh-transformed imr <dig> cell model, our results unveiled the extra-telomeric functions of htert in cell migration as well as in dna damage response during neoplastic transformation. therefore, our findings suggest that htert is an attractive target for cancer therapy, even at early stage of cancer formation.

RESULTS
rsh-transformed cells acquire cancer cells characteristics
primary human fibroblast cells imr <dig> were successfully co-transfected with ras, sv <dig> large-t, and htert and their protein expressions were confirmed by western blotting . morphologically, imr <dig> rsh fibroblasts appeared to be shorter and rounder compared to the infection control . this observation is consistent with the findings of mason and colleagues in imr <dig> cells transformed with e1a/ras  <cit> , suggesting that these changes are the unique characteristics of cellular transformation. moreover, late passages of imr <dig> control cells underwent significant increase in cell sizes, indicating their senescent status. however, this was not observed in imr <dig> rsh cells even after several passages .

one of the hallmarks of the cancerous cells is they can survive and grow in the absence of anchorage to the extracellular matrix  <cit> . our anchorage independent growth assays demonstrated that imr <dig> rsh cells formed small microscopic colonies  while mcf- <dig> cells, the positive control, formed large visible colonies   after 6 weeks. comparison of colony sizes with mcf- <dig> suggests that transformation by three genetic factors produced cells that were less tumorigenic than the established cancer cells. thus, the rsh-transformed cell could serve as a representative model to study the early events of cancer transformation, compared to an established cell line.

another common trait of cancer cells is their self-sufficiency in growth signals  <cit> . to investigate the effects of growth factors withdrawal on the rsh-transformed cells, the cells were subjected to a serum-free environment, following which cell proliferation and survival were assessed over a three-day period. as expected, imr <dig> control cells showed signs of apoptosis after 24 hours of serum withdrawal. however, no apoptosis was observed in imr <dig> rsh cells even after treating for 72 hours in serum-free condition, suggesting that these rsh-transformed cells were able to survive in the absence of growth factors . we further tested whether transformed fibroblasts are refractory to the induction of apoptosis, which is commonly observed in cancer cells  <cit> . after treating with doxorubicin , a dna damage-inducing drug for 48 hours, imr <dig> rsh cells were able to survive even at much higher dox concentrations  than imr <dig> control cells, reflecting an attenuation in the apoptotic machinery of the cells .

for potential use of imr <dig> rsh as a cancer cell model, we also assessed their chromosomal aberrations for recurrent abnormalities through cytogenetics study  <cit> . karyotyping of imr <dig> rsh cells revealed recurrent abnormalities . moreover, spectral karyotyping analysis revealed that  <dig> %  of imr <dig> rsh cells had recurrent chromosomal abnormalities at chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . taken together, these data indicated that imr <dig> cells were successfully transformed by co-expressing three oncogenic factors. the rsh-transformed fibroblasts acquired various characteristics of a human cancer cell and may serve as a valuable model to study the early events of tumorigenesis.

rsh-transformed cells and htert-overexpressing cells demonstrate increased migration capability
metastasis is often correlated to two attributes: migration followed by invasion  <cit> . metastatic tumors are believed to occur in the late stages of cancer  <cit> . however, in numerous early-stage cancers, recurrence can be observed even after the removal of non-invasive, benign tumors, suggesting the possibility of the cancer cells undergoing metastasis at a much earlier stage  <cit> . we questioned if imr <dig> rsh cells possess migration capability similar to that of a cancer cell. our boyden assay results showed that imr <dig> rsh cells had a greater migration capability as compared to imr <dig> control cells . this result was further validated with wound healing assay, in which the gap was reduced to 40% for imr <dig> rsh cells compared to 84% in imr <dig> control cells  . moreover, we observed that imr <dig> rsh cells migrated faster and in a more individualistic pattern compared to imr <dig> control cells, implying some degree of autonomy .

given that transformation can increase the migration capability of cells and that htert is one of the upregulated factors in the transformed cells, it then raised the question as to whether htert alone can contribute to this phenomenon. in order to assess the possible role of telomerase in cell migration, we also performed wound healing assay on imr <dig> cells expressing htert alone. similar to imr <dig> rsh cells, the htert-overexpressing imr <dig> cells  also migrated faster than imr <dig> control cells . however, when compared to imr <dig> rsh cells, the migration process in imr <dig> htert cells started to occur only after 10 hours and they seemed to have a slower migration rate. as shown in figure 2e and f, imr <dig> htert cells migrated about 50% distance, yet the distance was only reduced by 10% for imr <dig> control cells . collectively, these suggest that htert does play a role in cell migration, which in turn contributes to the metastatic potential of cancer cells.

microarray analysis supports the notion that htert plays a role in cell migration
to investigate the underlying molecular basis of htert-induced migration in transformed cells, we analyzed the genome-wide gene expression in imr <dig> rsh cells and imr <dig> htert cells. there were a total of  <dig> and  <dig> migration-related genes that were found to be differentially expressed  in imr <dig> rsh cells and imr <dig> htert cells respectively. among these differentially expressed genes,  <dig> genes were found to be overlapped in both imr <dig> rsh and imr <dig> htert cells , suggesting that these genes may attribute to migration during neoplastic transformation and specifically, they were under the regulation of htert. approximately 93% of the genes were found to be up-regulated by htert. remarkably, pro-inflammatory factors such as interleukin- <dig>  and il <dig> were significantly enhanced in both rsh-transformed cells and htert-overexpressing cells. previous published data demonstrated that il <dig> and il <dig> are targets under htert-mediated regulation of nf-κb pathway  <cit> . on top of their role in inflammation, they are also found to be involved in tumor cell migration and invasion  <cit> , which is corroborated with our microarray data. taken together, it is reasonable to hypothesize that htert could enhance the cell migration through nf-κb pathway in early tumorigenesis.

on the other hand, liu et al. in  <dig> have shown that htert promotes the epithelial-mesenchymal transition  by upregulating snail family zinc finger  <dig>  and vimentin through wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in gastric cancer  <cit> . we did not observe significant changes in snail- <dig> and vimentin genes expressions in our cell models and this could be attributed to different cell model used in both studies. however, we noticed that two downstream genes of wnt/beta-catenin pathways, namely cyclooxygenase- <dig>  and twist <dig> were significantly enhanced in both rsh-transformed cells and htert-overexpressing cells. both were reported to be implicated in cancer cell migration  <cit> , and this is in consistent with our microarray data. taken together, our microarray data complements with our previous notion that htert play an important role in cell mobility, which in turn contributes to the metastatic potential of cancer cells.

htert might be implicated in dna damage response via upregulating ku <dig> during imr <dig> transformation
to delineate the roles of htert in neoplastic transformation, we performed mass spectrometry analysis on the protein levels of imr <dig> rsh cells. surprisingly, analysis by mass spectrometry revealed that protein ku <dig> was exclusively found in imr <dig> rsh cells, but not in imr <dig> control cells . moreover, both rt-pcr and immunoblotting results confirmed our observation where ku <dig> expression was augmented in imr <dig> rsh as well as imr <dig> htert cells, but not in imr <dig> control cells . this could be indicative of an activated dna damage responses  in both imr90-rsh and imr90-htert since ku <dig> is a ddr sensor and is implicated in the non homologous end joining  pathway  <cit> . ku <dig> forms a heterodimeric complex with ku <dig>  <cit> . however, the protein expression of ku <dig> remained unchanged . presence of ku <dig> in imr <dig> rsh cells and imr <dig> htert cells prompted us to assess whether other ddr-associated proteins could be regulated by htert as well. our microarray data revealed that several ddr-associated genes were upregulated in both rsh-transformed imr <dig> and htert-overexpressing imr <dig> cells  . taken together, these results suggest that htert may play an important role in ddr pathways, via ku <dig> and other ddr-associated proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the neoplastic transformation of human primary fibroblast cells using sv <dig> large-t antigen, h-ras and htert can be used as an in vitro cell model for cancer studies, especially for those fibroblasts originated tumors. moreover, our findings suggest that htert is implicated in cell migration as well as ddr during neoplastic transformation. as these processes have great implications in cancer progression, our study could provide insights on the roles of htert and its underlying mechanisms in human cancer formation.
