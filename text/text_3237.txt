BACKGROUND
multiple rounds of wgd events  cyclically increase the genetic diversity in vascular plants, and subsequently this is steadily eroded by genomic fractionation toward diploid-like genomes. lineage-specific wgd events followed by genome repatterning and descending dysploidy toward diploid-like genomes have been revealed in several angiosperm groups and are probably best characterized in grasses  <cit>  and brassicales  <cit> . despite still scant knowledge of the number and genealogical context of ancient wgd episodes  <cit> , c. 15% of speciation events among extant angiosperms are associated with polyploidy  <cit> .

polyploidy has also played a significant role in colonization and species radiation on islands. multiple examples of long-distance dispersals of diploid progenitors or polyploid founders followed by adaptive radiation are documented on well-studied archipelagos   <cit> . remarkably, species radiation on islands is usually characterized by chromosomal stasis, i.e. uniformity of chromosome numbers/ploidy levels  <cit> . this means that adaptive or species radiations proceed through homoploid divergence, rather than by changing the number of linkage groups by dysploidy and/or polyploidy. the reasons for insular chromosomal stasis are most likely complex and lineage-specific, albeit the young age of radiating polyploid lines and the adaptive advantage of successful polyploid founders and their descendants are suspected as crucial factors. although chromosomal stasis does not necessarily imply karyotypic stasis  <cit> , only a handful of reports deal with the evolution of whole chromosome complements in island endemics. with the exception of the hawaiian silverswords , analyzed through inter-species crossing experiments and meiotic chromosome pairing configurations  <cit> , none of the homoploid species complexes on islands has been analyzed for whole-genome collinearity.

the genus pachycladon  comprises nine morphologically and ecologically diverse species in mainly alpine habitats of the south island of new zealand, and a single species occurs in alpine habitats in tasmania  <cit> . the morphology of pachycladon is so diverse that prior to the genus being recircumscribed by  <cit> , species were also placed in cheesemania and ischnocarpus. pachycladon is monophyletic  <cit> , characterized by little genetic variation amongst species at a variety of genetic loci  <cit> , and the species are interfertile  <cit> . furthermore, six pachycladon species analyzed karyologically all have the same chromosome number of 2n =  <dig>  <cit>  and comparable genome sizes . pachycladon is related to arabidopsis  <cit> , with both these genera belonging to the polyphyletic tribe camelineae  <cit> . the close relationship between these genera is underlined by the generation of a sexually derived intergeneric hybrid between a. thaliana and p. cheesemanii  <cit> .

based on chromosome counts and preliminary cytogenetic data, pachycladon species were thought to have a polyploid origin . indeed, an allopolyploid origin of the genus during the pleistocene between ~ <dig>  and  <dig>  mya  has been confirmed through identification of two paralogous copies of five single copy nuclear genes  <cit> . phylogenetic data of joly et al.  <cit>  suggested that one of the purported parents comes from the polyphyletic camelineae or the genus boechera , whereas the brassica copy from the crucifer lineage ii. our recent comparative phylogenomic study of some allopolyploid australian camelineae species  revealed their close phylogenetic affinity to pachycladon and other camelineae taxa  <cit> . the ~ <dig> to  <dig> million old allopolyploid event in the ancestry of australian genera was found to be obscured by extensive chromosome repaterrning leading to the extant diploid-like karyotypes . such concealed wgd episodes still detectable by comparative genetic and cytogenetic analysis were classified as mesopolyploid  <cit> . although both recent studies  <cit>  argued for an allopolyploid origin of the new zealand and australian camelineae genera, the unknown genome structure of pachycladon species did not yet allow to elucidate the relationship between the two polyploid camelineae groups.

in the present paper comparative chromosome painting  has been applied to four pachycladon species  that represent the morphological, ecological and phylogenetic diversity of the genus , and for which genetic maps are not available. pachycladon enysii is a monocarpic, lanceolate and serrate-leaved, stout terminal inflorescence species of high altitude  alpine greywacke rock; p. novae-zelandiae is a polycarpic, lobed-leaved, lateral inflorescence species of mid-altitude  alpine schist rock; and p. chessemanii and p. exile are polycarpic, heterophyllous, slender terminal inflorescence and generalist species of high fertility rock such as limestone, schist, and volcanics and occur from near sea-level to the alpine zone   <cit> . we used ccp to study the extent of chromosome collinearity between the ten chromosomes of pachycladon species and the eight chromosomes of the theoretical ancestral crucifer karyotype . combining comparative cytogenetic data with already published accounts on phylogenetics, biogeography, and ecology of the genus we addressed  genome structure and evolution of pachycladon species,  the genome relationship to other crucifer species, particularly to the endemic australian camelineae taxa, and  the role of major karyotypic reshuffling in the species radiation in the island setting.

RESULTS
comparative structure of pachycladon karyotypes
the karyotype structure of four pachycladon species  has been reconstructed by comparative chromosome painting  . considering the close phylogenetic relationship between pachycladon and arabidopsis  <cit> , we assumed that both genera descended from the ancestral crucifer karyotype  with eight ancestral chromosomes ak <dig> to ak <dig>  <cit> . hence a. thaliana bac clones and contigs corresponding to the  <dig> conserved genomic blocks  of the ack were used as painting probes to identify collinear chromosome regions in pachycladon species. the four reconstructed karyotypes showed overall similarity, comprising seven metacentric  and three acrocentric  chromosomes with the identical arrangement of ancestral gbs . the structural uniformity of all reconstructed karyotypes suggests that this structure is the ancestral pachycladon karyotype.

all  <dig> gbs were found to be duplicated within the analyzed pachytene complements displaying regular meiotic pairing . the pachycladon karyotype comprises one ak chromosome , seven ak-like chromosomes discernible within the composite pachycladon chromosomes , and  <dig> ak-like chromosome arms . thus, in total forty-three ancestral gbs  remained intact and only five blocks were split within one chromosome arm , between two arms of the same chromosome , or between two different chromosomes . except chromosome pc <dig> resembling chromosome ak <dig>  all pachycladon chromosomes originated through "fusion" of two or three ak chromosomes .

this table shows the extent of conservation of the eight ancestral chromosomes  and  <dig> genomic blocks  of the duplicated ancestral crucifer karyotype  in pachycladon and australian camelineae species  <cit> . pk- pachycladon karyotype , ba - ballantinia antipoda , sl - stenopetalum lineare , and sn - s. nutans .

evolution of the ten pachycladon chromosomes
we have reconstructed the origin of the nine "fusion" chromosomes of the ancestral pachycladon karyotype using the minimal number of rearrangements and assuming that the ten pc chromosomes originated from the duplicated ack .

pc <dig> and pc <dig> chromosomes
. pc <dig> originated via a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes ak <dig> and ak <dig> with breakpoints in the centromeric region of ak <dig>  and in the block d of ak <dig>  the second translocation product harbouring the ak <dig> centromere has been involved in a subsequent reciprocal end-to-end translocation with ak <dig>  resulting in chromosome pc <dig>  as the four gbs  of ak <dig> have the ancestral position within pc <dig> chromosome, we infer an inactivation and/or loss of the ak <dig> centromere.

pc <dig> chromosome
. the origin of pc <dig> can be reconstructed as a paracentric inversion of the block d on ak <dig> followed by nested "fusion" of this chromosome into the centromere of ak <dig>  the nested "fusion" required three or four breakpoints: two at the chromosome termini of ak <dig> and one or two at the centromere of ak <dig>  one breakpoint would presumably disrupt the ak <dig> centromere, whereas two breaks at pericentromeric regions of the opposite arms would yield a dispensable minichromosome as a second translocation product.

pc <dig> and pc <dig> chromosomes
. pc <dig> and pc <dig> were generated through the reshuffling of ancestral chromosomes ak <dig> and ak <dig>  and ak <dig>  ak <dig> and ak <dig>  respectively. a pericentric inversion  transforming ak <dig> into a telocentric chromosome was followed by a reciprocal translocation between this chromosome and ak <dig>  this translocation joined the long arm of ak <dig>  with the ak <dig> telocentric . the ak4-derived telocentric chromosome comprising only the centromere and block i has undergone a reciprocal end-to-end translocation with ak <dig>  as the gb collinearity around the ak <dig> centromere between blocks l and m remained conserved, we inferred an inactivation and/or loss of this centromere on pc <dig>  a small reciprocal translocation between the bottom arm of pc <dig>  and the upper arm of pc <dig> occurred after the major reshuffling steps. a paracentric inversion between gbs k and l on pc <dig> could have occured before the origin of both pc chromosomes or it is a later event.

pc <dig> chromosome
. this chromosome most likely originated via a reciprocal end-to-end translocation between ak <dig> and ak <dig> and was probably followed by a concurrent or subsequent inactivation and/or loss of the ak <dig> centromere, reflected by the ancestral position of blocks v and wa on pc <dig>  this event was followed by a pericentric inversion with breakpoints in the centromeric region  and within block w.

pc <dig> chromosome
. pc <dig> originated via a reciprocal translocation between ak <dig> and ak <dig>  yielding the fusion pc <dig> chromosome and a meiotically unstable minichromosome containing the centromere of ak <dig>  the translocation was preceded by a paracentric inversion on ak <dig>  and pericentric inversion on ak <dig> .

pc <dig> and pc <dig> chromosomes
. chromosome pc <dig> originated through a reciprocal translocation between ak <dig> and ak <dig> with breakpoints in the ak <dig> pericentromere  and the proximal part of the bottom arm of ak <dig> . the second translocation product  participated in a reciprocal end-to-end translocation with ak <dig> which resulted in the origin of pc <dig> and small acentric fragment. ancestral arrangement of ak3-derived gbs suggests that the ak <dig> centromere has been lost or inactivated.

the reconstructed chromosome origins are congruent with the reduction of  <dig> ancestral chromosomes  to only  <dig> in pachycladon. centromeres of both homeologues of ak <dig>  ak <dig>  ak <dig>  ak <dig> and ak <dig> remained functional, whereas six centromeres were lost . the centromere of one ak <dig> homeologue was eliminated due to the nested chromosome fusion, one ak <dig> centromere was eliminated via symmetric translocation, and both ak <dig> centromeres and centromeres of second homeologues of ak <dig> and ak <dig> were inactivated/lost .

out of the  <dig> breakpoints inferred for the origin of ten pachycladon chromosomes,  <dig>  map to pericentromeric regions,  <dig>  to telomeric regions, whereas only five  occurred within gbs .

chromosome landmarks 
we have analyzed mitotic and pachytene chromosome complements of the four pachycladon species for the distribution of heterochromatin domains, localization of ribosomal rna genes  and the arabidopsis-type telomere repeat . except for prominent heterochromatin of pericentromeres and terminal nucleolus organizing regions  , a single heterochromatic knob occurs in p. enysii and two knobs were found in p. exile. whereas two of the three knobs reside within genomic blocks , the knob on the bottom arm of pc <dig> in p. exile is localized between blocks g and h, i.e. at the site of presumably inactivated centromere of ak <dig> . no heterochromatic domains were observed at the sites of other presumably inactivated and/or lost paleocentromeres. the telomere n repeat hybridized only to chromosome ends and no interstitial telomeric signals were observed . whereas the four species have a single 5s rdna locus at the same position, the number of terminal 45s rdna loci varies. p. novae-zelandiae has one, p. cheesemanii and p. exile possess two, and p. enysii has three 45s rdna loci, with 45s locus on the upper arm of pc <dig> being common to all species . thus, the cross-species karyotypic stasis does not apply to the number of terminal 45s rdna loci.

discussion
we have used comparative chromosome painting to reconstruct karyotype structure and evolution in the genus pachycladon. interestingly, our analysis showed that the four analyzed species representing the phylogenetic, ecological and morphological diversity of the genus possess an identical karyotype, which is also most likely to be the ancestral karyotype of the genus pachycladon.

chromosomal and karyotypic stasis in pachycladon
the present study of four pachycladon species is the first whole-genome analysis of an island species radiation. pachycladon species have uniformly ten chromosomes  <cit>  and this infrageneric chromosomal stasis has been now extended for karyotypic stasis. overall similar genome structures supported the monophyletic origin of the genus  <cit>  and allowed inference of the ancestral pachycladon karyotype whose structure remained conserved in the extant species. karyotypic stasis revealed in pachycladon clearly indicates that the pleistocene species radiation on the south island of new zealand  <cit>  was not associated with major chromosome rearrangements. the four karyotypes differ only by the number of heterochromatic knobs and nors, without an apparent link to infrageneric phylogenetic relationships . hence, the speciation proceeded through homoploid divergence from the ancestral allopolyploid genome.

perhaps with the exception of meiotic studies in the hawaiian silversword alliance  <cit>  there is virtually no data on karyotype evolution during island angiosperm speciation. hence, only the variation in chromosome number/ploidy level can be discussed more extensively. several surveys of angiosperm chromosome numbers showed the trend of chromosomal stasis during species radiation on islands . this tendency might appear paradoxical considering geographical isolation and a wealth of diverse insular environments potentially promoting the origin of novel chromosomal races and karyotypes. however, genomes diverging on islands are under multiple constraints determining chromosomal stasis or chromosomal variation. as self-evident factors influencing the insular species radiation and genomic stability are the age of islands and their distance from the mainland, the number of colonization events, the incidence of polyploidy and phylogenetic constraints. colonizations followed by adaptive radiation on  islands represent often relatively young evolutionary events and therefore many island endemics represent monophyletic lineages comprising closely related species with uniform chromosome numbers. furthermore, it was concluded that chromosomal stasis vs. lability is under a strong phylogenetic constraint as some lineages  seem to be more prone to genome reshuffling than others  <cit> .

generally the low incidence of polyploidy has been claimed for island floras  <cit> . these estimates collated prior to the era of indepth whole-genome analyses revealing multiple whole-genome duplications of a different age  had to be, by definition, too conservative. recent studies suggest that colonization of islands has been frequently associated with hybridization and allopolyploidy . allopolyploid ancestors originated either on continents and spread to islands  or diploid ancestors hybridize in situ after long-distance dispersal . the allopolyploidy-driven speciation on islands is frequently associated with chromosomal stasis as shown for the hawaiian flora with the high incidence of polyploidy .

polyploidy is also a pronounced feature of the new zealand flora, with 72% of the species being polyploid in families with  <dig> or more species  <cit> . chromosomal features of new zealand plants indicative of polyploidy are the high number of species with even haploid numbers and/or haploid numbers n = > 10- <dig>  <cit> . many of the polyploid genera that are like pachycladon  exhibiting chromosomal stasis are species-rich and generally considered to be recent species radiations, often into mainly alpine-montane habitats. they include, for example, aciphylla , brachyglottis , chionochloa , gentianella , epilobium , and ourisia  .

chromosomal stasis is also observed in the few crucifer genera that have species radiations on islands. all seven parolinia species endemic to the canary islands probably have 2n =  <dig> , and seven shrubby species of descurainia endemic to the canary islands share 2n =  <dig>  <cit> . similarly, of nine diplotaxis species in the cape verde islands, five have 2n =  <dig>  <cit> . unfortunately, insufficient chromosomal data are available for c.  <dig> cardamine species endemic to new zealand  as well as for most crucifer genera endemic to australia  <cit> .

pachycladon karyotype is derived from the duplicated ancestral crucifer karyotype
our data suggest that the ancestral pachycladon karyotype  was derived from the duplicated ancestral crucifer karyotype  through allopolyploidy. the ack was expected to be inferred as an ancestral genome of pachycladon, as all of the camelineae genomes analyzed thus far have descended from the ack . furthermore, the karyotypes of crucihimalaya and transberingia, two genera often found as being the closest relatives of pachycladon  <cit> , resemble the ack structure  <cit> . similarly, the ack was proposed as an ancestral karyotype for tribes boechereae and cardamineae . it is likely, therefore, that the ancestral pachycladon genome has been derived from the hybridization between two ack-like genomes. the primary allopolyploid had either the structure of duplicated ack with n =  <dig> or the participating genome were reduced  prior to the hybridization event and the allopolyploid had less than  <dig> chromosome pairs. the fact that paralogous genomic blocks do not lay on the same chromosome suggests that the modern pachycladon chromosomes were reshuffled prior to the hybridization event, rather than due to homeologous recombination between two ack-like genomes within the allopolyploid ancestor.

the ten composite pachycladon chromosomes originated through inversions, reciprocal translocations and centromere inactivation/loss events within the duplicated ack complement . chromosome "fusions" were mediated by reciprocal translocations with or without preceding para- and pericentric inversions. these translocations yielded a "fusion" chromosome and centric fragment as the second translocation product. small acentric fragments and the minichromosome harbouring one ak <dig> centromere were meiotically unstable and eliminated. whereas robertsonian-like translocations eliminating one ak centromere together with the minichromosome is a common mechanism of the karyotype evolution in brassicaceae  <cit> , asymmetric translocation events yielding miniature acentric fragments and dicentric chromosomes with one ak centromere apparently inactivated or removed by recombination were proposed for the origin of composite chromosomes in the australian camelineae species  <cit> . centromere inactivation and/or loss has been inferred on bottom  arms of four pachycladon chromosomes  based on the absence of ancestral centromeres and conserved organization of adjacent genomic blocks . the incidence of centromere inactivation in australian and new zealand camelineae species might be tentatively related to the common ancestry of both lineages and/or to the duplicated character of the allopolyploid ancestral genomes. centromere inactivation of ak <dig> can also be suggested for the origin of chromosome at <dig> in a. thaliana  <cit> , and centromere inactivation of ak <dig> for the origin of bst <dig> in boechera stricta  <cit>  and chromosome ak4/ <dig> in neslia paniculata  <cit> . nevertheless, an alternative mechanism of centromere removal through subsequent paracentric and pericentric inversions followed by a symmetric translocation  is also plausible, though more breakpoints have to be considered. a dicentric chromosome could also be stabilized by intrachromosomal translocation, with breakpoints in pericentromeric region of one of the ancestral centromeres, followed by a loss of the resulting centric fragment.

chromosome pc <dig> originated probably through a nested "fusion" of chromosome ak <dig> between chromosome arms of ak <dig>  as both ak chromosomes within pc <dig> possess the ancestral structure of genomic blocks  translocation events with breakpoints at chromosome termini of ak <dig> and centromere of ak <dig> seems to be the parsimonious scenario. in grasses , insertional chromosome "fusion" has been proposed as a general mechanism of descending dysploidy  <cit> , whereas in crucifers it can be suggested only for the origin of chromosome ak2/ <dig> in hornungia alpina  <cit> . thus, pachycladon chromosome pc <dig> is most likely the first instance of reconstructed insertional dysploidy in brassicaceae. an alternative mechanism of the pc <dig> origin via end-to-end reciprocal translocation coupled with the elimination of the ak <dig> centromere requires two more breakpoints.

common origin of pachycladon and australian camelineae species?
based on the phylogenetic analysis of australian camelineae taxa and pachycladon species,  <cit>  concluded that both groups might originate from a very similar allopolyploid ancestor. although the authors could not reject a single origin of both lineages, they considered two successive allopolyploidization events as more likely, i.e. mesopolyploid australian camelineae species originated and radiated in continental arid habitats before the mesopolyploid ancestor of pachycladon. the present data corroborate this conclusion. specifically, the two species groups do not share any cytogenetic signature, i.e. a taxon/lineage-specific chromosome rearrangement, such as the rearranged ak <dig> homeologue shared by five australian species analyzed  <cit> . in the australian species, any two paralogous gbs differ by the length and fluorescence intensity as revealed by ccp  <cit> . this difference was either present already in the hybridizing progenitors or was caused by preferential fractionation of paralogous regions belonging to only one subgenome  <cit> . in pachycladon, two paralogous copies of all gbs cannot be distinguished upon ccp analysis. furthermore, higher chromosome number in pachycladon species  than in the australian species  implies a more recent origin and less extensive diploidization in pachycladon. indeed, the significantly lower number of non-ancestral junctions of genomic blocks in pachycladon compared to ballantinia antipoda and the two stenopetalum species  underlines the less extensive genome reshuffling in pachycladon. also the number of split gbs in pachycladon  is lower than in the australian species . interestingly, both groups do not differ substantially by the number of preserved ak chromosomes, chromosome arms and gbs . this comparison suggests that the most recent steps of chromosome number reduction in the australian camelineae species have been mediated by tandem end-to-end translocations followed by centromere inactivation/loss, not disrupting the structure of ak-like chromosomes and chromosome arms.

altogether, the differences in genome structure between the mesopolyploid australian and new zealand lineage indicate two successive wgd events involving the same pool of parental species. the existence of the progenitor species in australia for a long period of time is a credible assumption considering the remarkable stasis of the ack and ak chromosomes across crucifer lineages i and ii  <cit> . further research is needed to elucidate if the ancient ack-like karyotype could be found in some not yet analyzed australian crucifer species. recurrent formation of allopolyploids from the same or closely related parents has been documented, e.g. in the north american allopolyploid species of tragopogon  <cit> , in persicaria  <cit>  or arabidopsis kamchatica  <cit> , and also proven by the generating synthetic allopolyploids as arabidopsis suecica  <cit> , tobacco  <cit>  or tragopogon mirus and t. miscellus  <cit> .

although less likely, we cannot rule out that karyotypic change in the australian camelineae species and in pachycladon had significantly different dynamics. the australian brassicaceae species exhibit a predominantly annual growth habit  <cit>  in comparison to the perennial pachycladon  <cit> , and a more rapid rate of genome evolution could therefore be brought about with faster nucleotide substitution rates that occur in many annuals  <cit> . perennials are thought to have greater chromosomal stasis than annuals  <cit> . certainly the annuality could have accelerated genome reshuffling in the australian lineage. however, for brassicaceae we have insufficient data on large-scale genome evolution in relation to the life forms, reproduction systems and ecological factors, and as noted by  <cit>  and  <cit>  chromosomal evolution is often stochastic and does not obey the models.

phylogeographic scenario of the origin of pachycladon
pachycladon is the only new zealand genus from the polyphyletic tribe camelineae , and therefore an in situ origin seems unlikely. the closest camelineae relatives of pachycladon occur in australia  and eurasia/beringia   <cit> . it seems more plausible that the hybridization event giving rise to pachycladon has taken place on the australian continent.

there are strong taxonomic and biogeographic links between australia and new zealand and dispersal across the tasman sea can occur in both directions. tasmania and new zealand have about  <dig> species in common  <cit> , and there are many genera in continental australia and new zealand that have species that are closely related . for these shared genera, species diversity is often highest in new zealand and the australian species are considered to be the result of westward dispersal from new zealand and subsequent speciation . indeed, p. radicatum occurs in the tasmanian mountains and is considered to have dispersed there and diverged contemporaneously with the radiation of pachycladon in new zealand  <cit> . other taxa are also shared between the two countries, but these are considered to have dispersed eastward from australia to new zealand and include, for example, craspedia  <cit> , montigena  <cit> , poranthera  <cit> , scleranthus  <cit> , and stylidiaceae  <cit> . this pattern of eastward dispersal means it is plausible that pachycladon could have originated in australia and then subsequently dispersed to new zealand.

an alternative scenario of the origin of the pachycladon allopolyploid ancestor in  eurasia followed by a later dispersal to new zealand is unlikely and incongruent with the close phylogenetic ties of pachycladon to australian camelineae. also, the origin of pachycladon and australian crucifer species in new zealand is very unlikely, considering the diversity of endemic australian brassicaceae taxa .

many of the australian camelineae are distributed in the arid eremaean zone and/or the southeastern temperate biome  <cit> , whereas in new zealand pachycladon mainly occupies montane-alpine habitats. these three environments have expanded in both australia and new zealand during the pliocene and pleistocene and are generally considered important drivers of species radiations . for the australian camelineae their origin and diversification ~ <dig> to  <dig> mya  <cit>  is consistent with other dated molecular phylogenies of a diverse range of arid-adapted taxa  <cit> . these dated phylogenies show the deepest divergences of taxa are consistent with the beginning of the formation of the arid zone in the mid-miocene and that most arid-zone species lineages date to the pliocene or earlier. the molecular clock date of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mya for the origin of pachycladon  <cit>  is also consistent with its alpine distribution and habitats in the southern alps in the south island of new zealand  <cit> . uplift of the southern alps occurred over the last  <dig> million years, but only reached a suitable height to permanently support alpine plants during the pleistocene.

reconstructed genome evolution corroborates the close relationship of pachycladon to arabidopsis and other camelineae species
the phylogenetic position of pachycladon has been investigated repeatedly using various nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial genes  <cit> . all studies are congruent in placing the genus into the crucifer lineage i, within the polyphyletic tribe camelineae  <cit> . although the phylogenetic relationships within camelineae are unclear, these studies have shown transberingia and crucihimalaya , sphaerocardamum , physaria , and boechera  to be among the closest relatives of pachycladon. based on the analysis of five single-copy nuclear genes,  <cit>  showed that pachycladon has an allopolyploid origin and that the two genomes were associated with two divergent brassicaceae lineages . one putative parental genome was associated with camelineae sensu lato  and the second genome being related to brassiceae, sisymbrium, eutremeae, thlaspideae, and remarkably also to cardamineae on the chalcone synthase gene tree. this pattern has been interpreted as the evidence of an inter-tribal allopolyploidization event at the origin of pachycladon.

a recent study using nuclear, mitochondrial and chloroplast genes, as well as significantly increasing the sampling of australian camelineae , has confirmed the allopolyploid origin of pachycladon and provides confidence that the two gene paralogues that constitute pachycladon are derived from within lineage i  <cit> . most importantly, this study has disclosed the close relationship of pachycladon to the australian genera arabidella, ballantinia, and stenopetalum, and the maternal gene paralogues of pachycladon and these three genera clustered with eurasian camelineae  and north american boechereae. the position of the paternal gene copy was less evident, but it was always embedded within lineage i, and therefore different from the study by  <cit> . mandakova et al.  <cit>  and the present study convincingly show that the pachycladon ancestor orginated from hybridization between a camelineae species and either another species of that tribe or a very closely related tribe of lineage i. future phylogenomic analyses of other australian crucifer genera are likely to further resolve the parentage and phylogenetic relationships of pachycladon.

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the remarkable infrageneric morphological and ecological differentiation in pachycladon is characterized by the genome stability manifested as chromosomal and karyotypic stasis. the monophyletic pachycladon species descended from a common allopolyploid ancestor  through a whole-genome duplication of the ancestral crucifer karyotype  and subsequent diploidization by descending dysploidy. furthermore, the present study and the phylogenetic data of  <cit>  clearly demonstrate the close relationship between the allopolyploid pachycladon and the allopolyploid australian camelineae taxa. ccp data demonstrate that both mesopolyploid groups most likely originated from two different wgd events that involved identical or very similar diploid parents. we argue that the pachycladon ancestor has its origin in australia and later dispersed to the south island of new zealand. the endemic australian and new zealand camelineae provide an excellent framework to examine the nature and consequences of differently-aged wgd events within a complex of closely related species.
