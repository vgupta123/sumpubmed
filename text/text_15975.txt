BACKGROUND
the cerrado region represents the second largest biome of the brazilian territory, with an area of approximately  <dig> million km <dig>  <cit> . the soils are rich in aluminum, poor in nutrients and very acidic, supporting only an adapted vegetation typically composed of a gradient of grassland, savannah and forest, interspersed with riparian or gallery forests, patches of semi-deciduous forest, swamp and marshes  <cit> . however, with appropriate chemical correction, cerrado soils can be very productive, and since the early 1960s large areas have been incorporated into agriculture  <cit> , such that currently the region represents the main grain producing area in brazil.

soils are the more diverse environment in terms of microorganisms on earth, with approximately  <dig>  gbp of microbial genome sequences per g of soil  <cit> . microorganisms directly affect the environment and agricultural systems, by means of an array of mechanisms that include biological nitrogen fixation  <cit> , suppression of diseases  <cit> , decomposition of organic matter  <cit> , plant growth promotion  <cit> , soil nutrient cycling  <cit>  and bioremediation  <cit> . however, soil microbial community structure and its associated biological processes can be readily affected by land use, as a result of changes in soil structure, water holding capacity, temperature fluctuations, organic matter and nutrients contents, ph, introduction of new plant species, and agrichemical inputs .

for decades, several studies have measured the impact of agriculture on soil microorganisms diversity and function, but using limited methodologies that identified few microorganisms and/or detected only generalist activities or microbial biomass . soil metagenome studies are finally revealing how deep the impacts of anthropogenic action may be. for example  <cit> , confirmed that native forest soils had higher bacterial diversity than agricultural soils, while  <cit>  showed greater relative abundance of certain bacterial orders and archaea in a soil under conservation management, in comparison to another on which conventional practices had been adopted.

brazilian economy greatly relies on agriculture, but the media frequently claims that the country adopts non-sustainable practices in agriculture. considering soil microbial biomass, the brazilian cerrado is even more sensitive than the amazon to the introduction of agriculture  <cit> , raising concerns about the impact on microbial community. limitations of using specific methodologies or genes rely on bias of specific primers, detection of uncultivable microorganisms, among others, but great advances have been achieved with the metagenomic shotgun approach, opening opportunities for revealing genetic and metabolic diversity as well as new metabolic routes, genes and products . therefore, in order to better understand the impact of agriculture on the cerrado soils, we used a shotgun metagenomic approach with taxonomic and functional analyses, comparing undisturbed and cropped areas.

RESULTS
soil physical and chemical properties and classical microbiological parameters
when physical properties were addressed, we observed that 23 years of continuous cropping resulted in increased microporosity and decreased macroporosity, for both the nt and ct treatments. in addition, soil density was increased in the ct system .table  <dig> soil physical proprieties at the 0–10 cm layer in an oxisol under native vegetation of cerrado  or cropped with soybean/corn under no-tillage  or conventional tillage  systems

for the chemical properties, the results obtained in the undisturbed treatment highlight the typical properties of the cerrado, with high al content and acidity, low p and nutrients . soil liming and fertilizer inputs to the cropped area increased the level of nutrients, especially p, and increased ph. in comparison to the native undisturbed area, organic matter slightly decreased with cropping under the conservationist system of nt, with a further significant decrease in the ct .table  <dig> soil chemical proprieties at the 0–10 cm layer in an oxisol under native vegetation of cerrado  or cropped with soybean/corn under no-tillage  or conventional tillage  systems

a three-fold decrease in soil mb-c and mb–n was observed with agriculture introduction in the cerrado . the arylsulfatase and acid phosphatase activities of the native area resembled those of the nt, but a decrease was verified in the ct treatment. β-glucosidase was also highest in the nt treatment, but it’s activity in the ct was similar to that observed in the native cerrado .table  <dig> microbial enzymes activities and microbial biomass of carbon and nitrogen evaluated in the soils samples at the 0–10 cm layer in an oxisol under native vegetation of cerrados  or cropped with soybean/corn under no-tillage  or conventional tillage  systems

sequencing analyses
in the shotgun metagenomic approach, for each treatment about  <dig> million sequences were generated, resulting in  <dig>  million reads and  <dig>  x 1010 bp. when submitted to the mg-rast server, an average of  <dig>  million proteins was classified as known proteins and  <dig>  million as predicted proteins but with unknown function .

rarefaction curves and principal coordinates analysis
the rarefaction curves from samples generated in mg-rast showed that even with almost  <dig> million sequences, the curves were not saturated, indicating high genetic diversity .

the results obtained in the pcoa analysis indicated that agricultural and undisturbed cerrado soils had different taxonomic profiles , and similar results were observed for the functional profiles .fig.  <dig> pcoa analysis generated in  mg-rast abundance compared to m5nr database and  of functional categories of subsystems generated in mg-rast using normalized values  and bray-curtis distance for no-tillage , conventional tillage  and undisturbed cerrado  soil metagenomes



microbial community composition
the community structure analyses performed with the m5nr  database available in the mg-rast server  <cit>  showed that in all treatments the majority of the sequences were attributed to the bacteria domain, and the remaining were unclassified sequences  of archaea, eukaryota, unassigned , viruses and other sequences  .fig.  <dig> sequence abundance at the domain level compared to m5nr database using normalized values between  <dig> and  <dig> for no-tillage , conventional tillage  and undisturbed cerrado  soil metagenomes. for bacteria, archaea and viruses, p <  <dig>  in the comparison of nt or ct with the cerrado, but not between nt and ct



differences in microbial composition at the domain level were detected among the treatments. the largest was observed in bacteria domain, where the majority of the sequences were assigned to the nt and ct treatments, while the undisturbed soil had considerable lower numbers of sequences . the second largest domain was of unclassified sequences equally distributed in all treatments. interestingly, archaea were very low in two replicates of the native cerrado, but very abundant with the introduction of agriculture . eukarya was higher in two replicates of the nt treatment, but with no statistical difference between the treatments, and viruses were lower in the native soil  .

among the bacteria, the most abundant phylum was proteobacteria in both nt and ct, in comparison to the native area  . the two most abundant classes of proteobacteria were alphaproteobacteria and betaproteobacteria . actinobacteria was the second most abundant phylum of the bacteria domain, and in general was not very different among the treatments, except for one replicate of the ct. the bacteroidetes, firmicutes and unclassified sequences derived from bacteria were more abundant in nt and ct treatments in comparison to the cerrado, while the acidobacteria phylum dominated in the native soil  .fig.  <dig> sequence abundance phylum of bacteria domain compared to m5nr database using normalized values between  <dig> and  <dig> for no-tillage , conventional tillage  and undisturbed cerrado  soil metagenomes. for the proteobacteria, unclassified, bacteroidetes and firmicutes, p <  <dig>  in the comparison of nt or ct with the cerrado, but not between nt and ct; while for the acidobacteria, the cerrado was significantly higher, p <  <dig> 



we will focus on the results that have shown statistical differences between the treatments. the order rhizobiales was the most dominant in alphaproteobacteria in the ct and nt metagenomes  . within the rhizobiales, although the genus rhizobium was significantly higher in native soils, bradyrhizobium was higher in the soils under ct and nt . still in the alphaproteobacteria, the genus azospirillum was more abundant in the undisturbed soil  . within the alphaproteobacteria, the sphingomonadales was also higher in the ct and nt systems  .fig.  <dig> sequence abundance orders of alphaproteobacteria compared to m5nr database using normalized values between  <dig> and  <dig> for no-tillage , conventional tillage  and undisturbed cerrado  soil metagenomes. for the rhizobiales and sphingomonadales, p <  <dig>  in the comparison of nt or ct with the cerrado, but not between nt and ct

in the betaproteobacteria class, the order burkholderiales was the most abundant in the nt system, followed by nitrosomonadales, both in the ct and nt systems  . in the betaproteobacteria, the genus nitrosomonas was more abundant in the cropped areas, while in the gamaproteobacteria the pseudomonas and xanthomonas were significantly more abundant in the undisturbed soil  . the genus acidobacterium of the phylum acidobacteria was also higher in undisturbed soil  .

within the archaea domain, the crenarchaeota phylum was the most abundant in the nt soil, while the thaumarchaeota phylum was the second most abundant and unclassified archaea the third, in the nt and ct treatments, and all were practically not detected in the native soil  . within this last phylum, the genus nitrosphaera was more abundant in the nt and ct treatments .

as pointed out before, the eukaryota domain was more abundant in the nt treatment , where there was dominance of the phylum ascomycota , followed by unclassified sequences and of streptophyta, but these without statistical difference . the low number of viruses sequences, dominant in the ct and nt treatments , was represented only by the caudovirales order, higher in the ct and nt treatments in comparison with the cerrado  .

functional metagenome profiles
functional analysis generated by mg-rast classified the sequences in  <dig> subsystems , based on the relative abundance of the data normalized on a scale from  <dig> to  <dig>  the five categories with more sequences were the rna metabolism, protein metabolism, miscellaneous, clustering-based subsystems  and carbohydrates. the nt and the native soil showed similar numbers of sequences in all these subsystems, while the ct showed lower numbers of sequences. the ct had also lower numbers of sequences in other categories, including stress response, respiration, amino acids and derivatives, cell division and cell cycle. for the undisturbed area, we can mention higher numbers in the subsystems of cell division and cell cycling, motility and chemotaxis, dormancy and sporulation .fig.  <dig> abundance of functional classification in subsystems categories using normalized values between  <dig> and  <dig> for no-tillage , conventional tillage  and undisturbed cerrado  soil metagenomes



discussion
general characterization of the cerrado soils before and after the introduction of agricultural practices
the brazilian cerrado currently represents the most important grain producing area in the country, besides covering 24 % of the brazilian land  <cit> . the edaphoclimatic conditions of the cerrado find some parallel with the african savannahs, and in both cases, there are still few studies about microbial communities. the typical soil chemical properties of the cerrado are of high al content, low ph and low p, such that the use of lime and fertilizers is necessary to allow economic crop production and results in increased level of soil nutrients . the no-tillage  system is being increasingly adopted in the cerrado over the conventional tillage . reduced soil disruption and soil cover by plant residues in the nt result in improved physical and chemical properties over the ct, including higher organic matter  content, improved water retention capacity and lower oscillation of temperatures . our results confirmed higher om and nutrient contents  in the nt in comparison to the ct after 23 years of cropping .

as observed before  <cit> , significant reductions in microbial biomass , acid phosphatase and arylsulfatase activities were observed in the ct areas in comparison to the nt and the native cerrado . reduction in activity of both enzymes should be related to both the reduction in om and the addition of chemical fertilizers when agriculture was established in the area. contrarily, β-glucosidase  activity was higher in the nt than in the cerrado and in the ct, possibly due to the quality and quantity of plant residues, which are more complex in the undisturbed cerrado and in the ct, since the β-glucosidase acts in less complex residues .

microbial taxonomic and functional diversity
the shotgun approach in metagenomic studies allows better understanding about soil microbial communities, indicating not only the taxonomic groups, but also metabolic functions. the approach has already been successful in detecting differences in the composition and functionality of microbial communities in the comparison of nt and ct in a fertile oxisol of southern brazil, subtropical climate  <cit> . now, in a different edaphoclimatic condition and having an undisturbed area for comparison, we confirmed that both soil managements caused profound changes in microbial structure and functioning .

in general higher taxonomic diversity was not associated to the native cerrado, but rather to agricultural soils which showed higher abundances of bacteria, the predominant domain in the soil, as well as of archaea and viruses , in agreement with other studies carried out in brazil  <cit> , north america  <cit>  and europe  <cit> . the results indicate that the stresses imposed by agriculture modify soil microbiome by increasing its taxonomic diversity. for example, also using shotgun analyses mendes et al.  <cit>  have shown that the soybean rhizosphere selected taxonomic and functional communities for its best development. shifts may also be necessary to support the newly disrupted environment.

as in other metagenomic studies  <cit> , proteobacteria were dominant in all soils; however, one interesting observation of our study was the increase of this phylum in the nt and ct treatments , and emphasis should be given to the genus bradyrhizobium . brazilian soils are free of bradyrhizobium compatible with soybean  <cit> , and massive inoculation is usually practiced every cropping season  <cit> . genetic events such as high rates of horizontal transfer of symbiotic genes from the inoculant to indigenous rhizobia have been reported in the cerrado as a result of massive inoculation  <cit> , but no negative impacts on yield have ever been reported  <cit> . now we show that massive inoculation can indeed affect soil microbial communities, and soil enrichment with inoculant strains might help to explain some failures in introducing new strains in soils with established populations  <cit> . interesting, bradyrhizobium is related to the nitrogen metabolism subsystem, also more abundant in the agricultural soils . in contrast, in the undisturbed cerrado there was higher abundance of rhizobium , although in a proportion 100-times lower than bradyrhizobium in cropped soils . interestingly, studies with classical methods performed in undisturbed cerrado areas have reported high abundance of rhizobium species tolerant of acidity and stressful environmental conditions , indicating adaptation to the typical edaphoclimatic conditions of the region.

other groups that are critical for soil functioning and more abundant in agricultural soils were burkholderales and nitrosomonadales . the burkholderia are highly versatile in their ecological niches, including agricultural soils  <cit> , where they play important roles in soil bioremediation  <cit> , plant growth promotion and biological nitrogen fixation  <cit> . nitrogen-fixing burkholderia are abundantly found in the cerrado, especially in symbiosis with mimosa spp., plants that have this biome as their major center of diversity  <cit> ; in addition, burkholderia can colonize diverse host plants  <cit> . nitrosomonadales are related to nitrification processes  <cit> , fitting into the nitrogen metabolism subsystem , and their superiority in cropped soils  may reflect the use of n-fertilizer inputs to the maize crop, or n residues left by the soybean crop.

acidobacteria plays several functions in soils, including the degradation of polymers and soil contaminants  <cit> , and the cerrado is well known for the richness in these microorganisms . this group of microorganisms was more abundant in the cerrado , in agreement with previous comparisons between undisturbed cerrado and areas with agriculture and pastures. in general, actinobacteria were found in similar abundances in all three treatments . reports about actinobacteria vary with the biome; in amazon the phylum was higher in undisturbed than in deforested soil  <cit> , while in cerrado converted to pasture was higher than in the native area  <cit> . streptomyces is the most common actinobacteria genus in nature, and predominantly found in soils  <cit> . the genus has high ability to synthesize metabolites such as antibiotics  <cit> , and several studies in the cerrado biome have reported copious presence of these microorganisms  <cit> . their biotechnological importance as promising sources of chitinases, proteases and xylanases  should also be mentioned. in addition, their antagonism against several microorganisms can represent a useful biological control tool  <cit> , and they may also interfere with the introduction of beneficial microorganisms, as reported for inoculant strains of bradyrhizobium  <cit> .

other microorganisms such as bacteroidetes and firmicutes were also abundant in our study, especially in agricultural soils . the firmicutes phylum includes the classes bacilli and clostridia that are well known spore-forming microorganisms, resulting in greater chance of survival in disturbed environments. there are also reports that these microorganisms are dominant in environments rich in p  <cit> , and in our study the input of p-fertilizer to the cropped soils raised considerable their p content. in addition, this might explain the increase of sequences in the p metabolism subsystem in the nt treatment . bacteroidetes are usually very common in soils  <cit>  and in one study were more abundant in agricultural ecosystems, in comparison to a forest soil  <cit> . nacke et al.  <cit>  observed that the relative abundances of bacteroidetes increased with higher ph values, in agreement with the results from our study.

it has been suggested that soil ph  <cit>  and plant residues  greatly affect the diversity and activity of soil microbial communities. regarding soil ph, a good example is acidobacteria, very abundant in the acidic native cerrado soils  <cit>  and also found in our study. however, every biome has different responses to soil disturbance. for example, in our study the abundant groups acidobacteria and alphaproteobacteria were affected by agriculture introduction, with decreases and increases in taxonomic diversity, respectively. in contrast, navarrete at al.  <cit>  found no differences in the same groups when compared an amazon forest soil and a soil under slash-and-burn clearing.

as reported before in other metagenomic studies  <cit> , there were few sequences of archaea, and they were practically absent in the native cerrado . in a previous study, we detected more archaea in the nt than in the ct system in southern brazil  <cit> , and the result was attributed to a negative impact of tillage on this domain. similar results were now confirmed in the nt vs. ct soils of the cerrado, but they were— as also observed in another cerrado soil  <cit> —surprisingly low in the undisturbed soil. however, we must consider the observations of rodrigues et al.  <cit> , showing increase in richness and diversity of archaea in the dry season, and our samples were obtained in the rainy season. crenarchaeota, the most abundant phylum, was present only in the nt and thaumarchaeota, the second most abundant, was present in both nt and ct systems ; both phyla are relevant in agricultural soils due to their role in the nitrification process .

eukaryota was the third most abundant domain, with higher number of sequences in the nt treatment , and predominance of the ascomycota phylum . these results are in agreement with castro et al.  <cit> , that reported that human activity increased this phylum in comparison to the native soil, what could be related to a higher tolerance to environmental stresses  <cit> . the phylum includes a variety species that go from plant pathogens to decomposers of organic matter, but they are also important in undisturbed areas  <cit> . disking in the ct system would favor hyphae disruption, decreasing fungi population  <cit> , but the subject needs more studies to be clarified, as in southern brazil eukaryota were more abundant in the ct, with a possible explanation relying on the higher tolerance of fungi to environmental stresses  <cit> .

although viruses sequences were low , caudovirales was higher in agricultural soils . the order consists of bacteriophages commonly found in soils, and their role in infecting archaea and bacteria may help in population control  <cit> ; moreover,  <cit>  showed that this predation is important for the control and growth promotion of bacterial population in soil.

in relation to microbial functions, the two most abundant subsystems, rna and protein metabolism  are attributed to constitutive genes . miscellaneous  was the third more abundant subsystem in the nt, in agreement with other studies, where they are usually positioned among the four most abundant subsystems  <cit> . classification of sequences as “clustering-based” indicates an unknown function, and in general, this represents the most abundant subsystem in soil metagenomes  <cit> . in our study, these subsystems included genes such as cytochrome biogenesis, proteases, cell-cycling and cell division and were higher in the undisturbed soil, followed by the nt. the carbohydrates subsystems, including central carbohydrate metabolism and fermentation, were more abundant in the nt, what could be related to the soil enrichment with crop residues  <cit> . the increased β-glucosidase activity levels under nt, for instance, are closely associated with the composition of plant residues  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our study highlights that the brazilian cerrado soils encompass high taxonomic and functional diversity of soil microorganisms; however, both are highly impacted by agriculture. interestingly, as pointed out by fierer et al.  <cit> , functional diversity was not necessarily associated with the taxonomic diversity, as the least conservation system, the ct treatment, presented increased taxonomic sequences and reduced functional metagenomic profiles in comparison to the undisturbed cerrado. that might indicate a strategy in the ct to try to maintain soil functioning by favoring taxa that are probably not the most efficient for some functions, leading to negative impacts in soil quality with time. in addition, in general agricultural soils changed to be more adapted to degrade accessible carbon and aromatic compounds substrates, as well as to be enriched in microorganisms related to the metabolism of n, p and s, as a response to the addition of fertilizers. we should also mention that native soils were rich in unknown functions, emphasizing the possibility of finding new functions and genes.

the typical vegetation of cerrado, represented by stress-tolerant plant species, adapted to harsh conditions such as highly-weathered acidic soils, poor in nutrients, high temperatures, natural fire and long dry periods, might let us think that the biome could be less affected by anthropogenic activities. with the help of a metagenomic approach we have obtained new results that confirm previous observations using classical methods  <cit> , showing that the cerrado is, together with the amazon, the most fragile biomes in brazil. underneath the rustic appearance of the cerrado vegetation there is a fragile soil microbial community.
