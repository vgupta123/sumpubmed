BACKGROUND
temperature and photoperiod are the main environmental cues that regulate flowering time in winter cereals  <cit> . barley  is classified as a long-day plant, which means that it will flower earlier when exposed to increasing day lengths. some genotypes of barley require a period of prolonged exposure to cold during winter  to accelerate the transition of the shoot apex from vegetative to reproductive development  <cit> . this combination of a requirement for vernalization and sensitivity to photoperiod ensures that flowering is postponed until after winter to avoid frost damage, but then occurs rapidly as day-length increases during spring, thereby avoiding heat and water stress during summer  <cit> .

wheat and barley cultivars are classified on the basis of their flowering behavior into two types of growth habit, namely winter and spring. the former requires prolonged exposure to low temperature to flower, whereas the latter group flowers rapidly without exposure to cold. genetic studies have revealed that the epistatic relationships between three genes, vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  and vrnh <dig>  control the response to vernalization  <cit> . the winter growth habit depends on the combination of recessive alleles at vrnh <dig> and vrnh <dig> with the dominant allele at vrnh <dig>  <cit> . genotypes that possess other allelic combinations for these genes exhibit a spring growth habit to different degrees. in agronomic classifications of barley germplasm, a third category of cultivars, termed facultative  <cit> , is recognized, in which cultivars show winter hardiness but do not require vernalization.

the activity of vrnh <dig> is essential for flowering  <cit> . vrnh <dig> acts as a promoter of flowering, is induced by vernalization, and regulates the transition to the reproductive stage at the shoot apex  <cit> . allelic variation at vrnh <dig> has been described, mainly in relation to deletions within the first intron  <cit> . these deletions are presumed to be responsible for the different vernalization requirements that are associated with different alleles. in plants that have not been vernalized, the deletions lead to differences in the levels of the vrnh <dig> transcript and, consequently, the allelic variation results in diverse flowering times  <cit> .

vrnh <dig> is a floral repressor that delays flowering until plants are vernalized  <cit> . allelic diversity at vrnh <dig> arises from the presence or deletion of a cluster of three genes   <cit> . the null allele of vrnh <dig> corresponds to the recessive spring allele and is associated with rapid flowering  <cit> . day length is the major determinant of the level of vrnh <dig> expression, with high levels of expression occurring during periods with long days  <cit> .

hvft <dig>  candidate gene for vrnh <dig>  is a homolog of the flowering locus t gene  of arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> . strong evidence indicates that vrnh <dig> plays a central role in promoting flowering as an integrator of the vernalization and photoperiod pathways in temperate cereals  <cit> . recently, novel vrnh <dig> alleles that show different adaptive effects have been identified by analyzing sequence polymorphisms and their phenotypic effects  <cit> .

two major photoperiod response genes, ppdh <dig> and ppdh <dig>  have been reported in barley  <cit> . ppdh <dig> confers sensitivity to a long photoperiod and accelerates flowering under long days  <cit> . hvft <dig> has been identified as a candidate gene for ppdh <dig>  which is described as a gene that is responsive to a short photoperiod  <cit> . as far as can presently be determined, only two known hvft <dig>  alleles exist, one of which is a null  <cit> . however, it is not possible to rule out that additional alleles are also present in cultivated barley. the dominant allele is the functional one, comprises four exons, and produces faster development towards flowering under short days. the recessive allele is a truncated gene, retaining only the 3' portion of exon  <dig>  <cit> , and produces flowering delay under short days .

the complexity and strength of the interactions reported among these genes indicate that they share the same regulatory network  <cit> . vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  and vrnh <dig> form a feedback regulatory loop  <cit> . vrnh <dig> is probably the principal target of the vernalization signal  <cit> . levels of the vrnh <dig> transcript are downregulated by short days and by a high level of vrnh <dig> expression  <cit> . expression of vrnh <dig> delays flowering by inhibiting expression of vrnh <dig>  <cit> . after vernalization, transcription of vrnh <dig> decreases, which facilitates the upregulation of vrnh <dig> by long days in spring, and triggers flowering  <cit> . it is likely that the downregulation of vrnh <dig> is mediated by vrnh <dig>  photoperiod response genes also participate in the promotion to flowering. the dominant ppdh <dig> allele accelerates flowering by upregulating vrnh <dig> under long days  <cit> . ppdh <dig> is thought to upregulate vrnh <dig> expression under short-day conditions  <cit> . in addition, expression of ppdh <dig> has been detected both under short days  <cit>  and under long days when the levels of vrnh <dig> transcript decrease  <cit> .

as a result of these interactions, phenotypic responses of barley to environmental signals are complex. natural allelic variation at these flowering time genes has been found in several studies in relation to responses to vernalization  <cit> , photoperiod  <cit> , or both  <cit> . this natural variation might be related to adaptation to different environmental conditions.

in the study reported herein, we investigated further the patterns of expression and interactions of vrn and ppd genes in a selection of vernalization-responsive barley cultivars. these cultivars represented different allelic combinations of vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  and ppdh <dig> in a dominant ppdh <dig> and vrnh <dig> genetic background. the geographic distribution of ppdh <dig> alleles was analyzed in a wide array of barley germplasm that represented cultivars and landraces. in addition, the possible role of ppdh <dig> in the acceleration of flowering under long days was examined in a collection of winter cultivars, by analyzing their response to vernalization treatments of different duration.

RESULTS
distribution of ppdh <dig> alleles among domesticated barleys
we investigated the distribution of the ppdh <dig> alleles over a sample of  <dig> barley cultivars of different geographic origins  and  <dig> spanish landrace-derived inbred lines from the spanish barley core collection   <cit> . lines were classified according to their seasonal growth habit, on the basis of the allelic constitution at vrnh <dig> and vrnh <dig> . to enlarge the sample, we included previously published results for an additional  <dig> barley cultivars  <cit> . the dominant allele of ppdh <dig> gene was found in most of the spring cultivars , whereas the majority of winter cultivars  possessed the recessive  ppdh <dig> allele . facultative genotypes, characterized by having a winter allele at vrnh <dig>  and a null allele  at vrnh <dig>  did not show such a clear genetic distinction and approximately half  carried the dominant  ppdh <dig> allele . strikingly, the allelic distribution among sbcc landraces differed from that observed in the commercial cultivars. most of the winter spanish landraces  carried the functional ppdh <dig> allele . the  <dig> winter sbcc landraces all carried the dominant allele at vrnh <dig> and ppdh <dig> but possessed two different alleles at vrnh <dig>  according to the terminology for vrnh <dig> alleles proposed by hemming et al.  <cit> ,  <dig> of these landraces carried vrnh1- <dig> and  <dig> carried the earlier flowering vrnh1- <dig> allele  <cit> . ppdh <dig> was carried at the same frequency among landraces carrying the vrnh1- <dig> and vrnh1- <dig> alleles. the wild-type recessive vrnh <dig> allele was not detected among the spanish landraces.

a winter lines include genotypes that carry vrnh1- <dig>  vrnh1- <dig> or the wild-type vrnh <dig> allele at vrnh <dig>  <cit>  and the dominant allele at vrnh <dig> 

cold-induced gene expression under a long photoperiod
expression of the vernalization and photoperiod response genes was studied in eight barley lines, which represented four typical winter cultivars and four spanish landraces . the lines had been exposed to low temperature treatments of increasing length  under short days, in every case ensued by growth for  <dig> days under long days . all of the genotypes carried vrnh <dig> and the long-photoperiod-sensitive allele ppdh <dig>  which allowed observation of possible interactions between these genes and the other vernalization and photoperiod genes. the expression profiles of the vernalization and photoperiod response genes were assessed by quantitative reverse-transcription pcr . differences in expression among genotypes and treatments were found for vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  and ppdh <dig>  although expression data for ppdh <dig> were also analyzed, its expression is not shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig> because it was consistently high in all treatments and genotypes, and thus did not contribute to the variability of responses observed.

in all genotypes, vrnh <dig> expression increased gradually with increasing duration of vernalization treatment, although differences in response between vrnh <dig> alleles were evident. after  <dig> d of cold treatment, vrnh <dig> expression was only detected in genotypes that carried the larger ~ <dig> kb deletion in intron  <dig> , namely sbcc <dig> and sbcc <dig> . the level of vrnh <dig> expression was significantly higher in sbcc <dig> than in sbcc <dig> . after vernalization for  <dig> d, vrnh <dig> expression was detected in five genotypes . vrnh <dig> expression was detected in all genotypes only after  <dig> d of cold treatment . the expression level was highest for the vrnh1- <dig> and vrnh1- <dig> alleles , and lowest for the wild-type recessive winter allele vrnh <dig>  which was carried by plaisant, rebelle, arlois, and hispanic. even though these four cultivars carried the same vrnh <dig> allele, they showed differences in vrnh <dig> expression .

although all lines carried the active vrnh <dig> allele, differences in its expression were observed , and depended on the vrnh <dig> allele present. of the four cultivars that carried the vrnh <dig> allele, expression of vrnh <dig> was much higher for plaisant and rebelle than for arlois and hispanic, with the exception of the shortest cold treatment .

sbcc <dig> showed the highest level of vrnh <dig> expression under all conditions . after  <dig> d of vernalization, vrnh <dig> was detected only in sbcc <dig> and sbcc <dig> . vrnh <dig> expression was detected in sbcc <dig> and sbcc <dig> only after  <dig> d of cold treatment . under the experimental conditions used, vrnh <dig> expression was not detected in the four cultivars that carried the wild-type winter allele vrnh <dig> 

expression of ppdh <dig> was detected in all genotypes that carried the gene, i.e. all except plaisant and rebelle . the level of ppdh <dig> expression increased with increasing duration of vernalization , although the rate of increase differed among genotypes. after  <dig> d of cold treatment, only sbcc <dig> showed significant expression of ppdh <dig>  in sbcc <dig>  sbcc <dig>  and sbcc <dig>  pphd <dig> expression was detected after  <dig> d of vernalization, but expression was not detected in arlois or hispanic until after  <dig> d of cold treatment .

effect of vrnh <dig>  ppdh <dig>  and ppdh <dig> and different vernalization treatments on heading date in winter cultivars
to assess a possible effect of the major vernalization and photoperiod response genes on flowering time under natural conditions, we analyzed the time from planting to heading of  <dig> winter cultivars that were exposed to five different periods of vernalization, which ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> d, before transplantation to the field in martonvásár, hungary, on march 25th, which corresponds to a day length of  <dig> h  <dig> min. the list of barley lines and their genetic constitution for the major flowering-time genes is presented in additional file  <dig>  all of the lines carried the dominant allele at vrnh <dig>  although polymorphisms have been reported for the candidate genes , vrnh <dig> seems to be quite conserved among winter barleys, and just two alleles are usually assumed  <cit> . we evaluated the differences between the ppdh <dig>  ppdh <dig>  and vrnh <dig> alleles as a function of the duration of vernalization . this was possible because there were enough individuals in each of the  <dig> classes resulting from the combination of the three genes to perform an analysis. although the cultivars presented three different vrnh <dig> alleles , they were so unevenly distributed over the sample  that it was not possible to include it as an additional factor in the analysis. all three genes analyzed showed significant effects on flowering time. on average, the dominant allele at ppdh <dig> accelerated the onset of flowering by  <dig> d. lines that carried the functional allele at ppdh <dig> flowered  <dig> d earlier, and genotypes that carried the tc haplotype for vrnh <dig> flowered  <dig> d earlier. consistent with the expectation for winter genotypes, different durations of vernalization had a significant effect on flowering time.

in the present analysis, a significant interaction between ppdh <dig> and the different cold treatments was detected . exposure to a cold treatment before transplanting reduced the time to heading, although the reduction was not significant for vernalization treatments longer than  <dig> d. the presence of the dominant ppdh <dig> allele was associated with earlier flowering in plants that had not been vernalized fully .

we also analyzed the geographic distribution of  <dig> winter barley cultivars, which were assigned to their predicted phenotype on the basis of the presence of a complete hvft <dig> gene, and classified into three classes according to latitude. the ppdh <dig> dominant allele was predominant in winter cultivars from southern latitudes, whereas the proportion of cultivars with the recessive  allele ppdh <dig> was greater at higher latitudes .

discussion
heading date is a crucial trait for the adaptation of barley to different areas of cultivation and cropping seasons. traditionally, cultivars are classified into spring, facultative, and winter types on the basis of their flowering habit. this is an agronomic classification that is based on phenotypic behavior. it is a useful simplification that summarizes a more complex and diverse array of responses at the genetic level. study of the genes involved in the photoperiod and vernalization pathways in cereals is continuously producing new information that is shedding light on the nature of adaptation of cultivars and on the variety of phenotypic responses produced by the combination of photoperiod and vernalization genes carried by individual cultivars.

ppdh <dig> is not distributed randomly in barley germplasm
the spread of cultivated barley out of its area of origin was driven by the occurrence of phenotypic variation that resulted from the appearance of new multilocus flowering-time haplotypes at vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  ppdh <dig>  and ppdh <dig>  <cit> . mutations in vrnh <dig> allowed the expansion of cultivated barley from midlatitudinal regions to lower and higher latitudes, where spring types are common  <cit> . the entry of barley to europe occurred via several routes  <cit> ; one of them, to the north and then west, via the balkan peninsula, and another one towards the southwest, then through north africa, reaching europe through spain. in the first case the environmental conditions  favoured the recessive allele in ppdh <dig> so its frequency increased significantly within the winter forms. in the latter case, the ancestral form was not selected out from the winter barleys, which is exactly the case for the spanish landraces.

in midlatitudinal regions, including north africa, southern europe, nepal, china, and japan, both spring and winter barley types are cultivated. however, in these regions, the dichotomic agronomic classification is insufficient to describe the range of vernalization responses found, in which vrnh <dig> plays a central role. allelic diversity at vrnh <dig> has been described by several authors  <cit> . this diversity is the result of deletions or insertions within the first intron of the gene, and is associated with a gradation of vernalization responses from strict winter to spring types. in general, the larger the deletion, the shorter the vernalization period required.

although, originally, wild barley carried the photoperiod-responsive alleles ppdh <dig> and ppdh <dig> , mutant, nonresponsive alleles of these genes originated before domestication  <cit> . the appearance of the nonresponsive ppdh <dig> allele allowed the cultivation of barley to spread to more northerly regions  <cit> . regarding ppdh <dig>  some authors have already pointed out the prevalence of the dominant allele in spring cultivars, and its relative scarcity in winter cultivars  <cit> . in the present study, exclusively done with winter types, we found that, the dominant ppdh <dig> allele was frequent at lower latitudes  but not at higher latitudes. the dominant allele was also prevalent in a large set of winter landraces cultivated on the iberian peninsula . this pattern is remarkable, because latitudes below 44°n include almost the entire mediterranean region. in this region, barley is sown predominantly during autumn and, to a large extent, using winter cultivars.

the adaptive role of ppdh <dig> is confirmed by its influence on key agronomic traits. it was identified originally as a short-photoperiod quantitative trait locus in winter × spring barley crosses  <cit> . its effect is especially large in mediterranean latitudes, where it has been identified as the main qtl that affects flowering, together with eam <dig>  <cit> . it also affects grain yield indirectly, through flowering date, under mediterranean conditions  <cit> .

ppdh <dig> expression is mediated by the vernalization pathway in winter cultivars
analysis of gene expression can provide indications of the role of ppdh <dig> and interacting genes. to be meaningful for the mediterranean region, we chose to carry out this study with winter genotypes, unlike previous studies  <cit>  which focused on the effect of ppdh <dig> on spring genotypes.

expression of photoperiod and vernalization response genes show strong interactions  <cit> . a long photoperiod induces vrnh <dig> expression  <cit> , which then represses expression of vrnh <dig>  <cit>  and ppdh <dig>  <cit> . the model currently accepted proposes that during autumn and winter , vernalization induces vrnh <dig> expression and the short photoperiod downregulates vrnh <dig> expression  <cit> . subsequently, in spring, vrnh <dig> is relatively high, much more rapidly if vernalization was sufficient. although the long photoperiod conditions in spring are favorable for vrnh <dig> expression, vrnh <dig> is repressed by the expression of vrnh <dig>  once the vernalization requirement has been satisfied, vrnh <dig> expression is induced by long days  <cit> , after which the plants are committed irreversibly to reproductive development.

in our expression analysis, we compared three different vrnh <dig> alleles. at each time-point examined, the expression level was lower in the four winter cultivars that carried the full-length intron than in the four sbcc lines that carried two different deletions. as proposed previously  <cit> , vernalization did not block the induction of vrnh <dig> in response to increasing day length, which was detected under long days after  <dig> or  <dig> d of cold treatment. once vrnh <dig> is expressed, it can then begin to repress vrnh <dig> expression. however, the differences in responses observed among the four winter cultivars that carried the strict winter allele at vrnh <dig> were unexpected. two of these cultivars  behaved as expected; a long period  of cold induction was needed to detect vrnh <dig> expression. interestingly, for the other two cultivars , we detected expression of vrnh <dig> after only  <dig> d of cold treatment, and the transcript level increased further after  <dig> d of treatment. these four cultivars carry identical, recessive alleles at vrnh <dig> and vrnh <dig>  and dominant alleles at vrnh <dig> and ppdh <dig>  among the genes investigated, they differ only at ppdh <dig>  which leads us to think of a possible role of this gene in the earlier induction of vrnh <dig> expression. however, we cannot rule out the possibility that additional genes might be responsible for this induction.

in a previous study, we did not detect vrnh <dig> expression in some of these genotypes when they were grown without vernalization under a long photoperiod  or vernalized under a short photoperiod   <cit> . in winter genotypes, a period of cold induction is required before vrnh <dig> expression can be induced by long days, as reported already for the wild-type vrnh <dig> winter allele  <cit> . in the present study, we included cultivars that represented several recessive alleles at vrnh <dig>  because we had previous evidence that they might produce differences in heading date in the field among these cultivars  <cit> . different expression between vrnh <dig> alleles was detected only for the pair of lines with the largest deletion in vrnh <dig> . the tc allele showed higher expression than the ag allele, in the same direction as reported in a previous study  <cit> . however, there was no difference in vrnh <dig> expression between sbcc <dig> and sbcc <dig>  which showed the same polymorphism at vrnh <dig> among them than sbcc <dig> and sbcc <dig>  either the duration of the experiment was insufficient to reveal possible differences or other genes that are unaccounted for at present influence this pathway.

although the expression of ppdh <dig> is higher under a short photoperiod, we and other authors  <cit>  have reported ppdh <dig> expression under a long photoperiod. expression of ppdh <dig> was detected at some time -point in all genotypes that carried the dominant allele of ppdh <dig>  irrespective of day length. in winter genotypes, vrnh <dig> must be absent or clearly receding  for ppdh <dig> to be expressed.

ppdh <dig> promotes flowering irrespective of photoperiod under noninductive conditions
an additional question concerns the nature of the role of ppdh <dig>  ppdh <dig> has been suggested to affect the promotion of the transition of the shoot apical meristem from vegetative to reproductive, in the end affecting flowering. the two experiments that support this hypothesis, however, propose different modes of action for ppdh <dig>  on one hand  <cit> , it was proposed that hvft <dig>  substituted hvft <dig>  as the trigger to induce flowering under short days , although its expression was not sufficient to induce the transition to the reproductive stage. they did not find hvft <dig>  induction with  <dig> h of light, even after the transition of the meristem had taken place. another study  <cit> , concluded that hvft <dig> acts as a floral promoter under short days , but through the induction of hvft <dig> . therefore, it seems proven that ppdh <dig> promotes flowering under short days, but the mechanism  of action are not clear yet. the experiments just reported used different genotypes and, probably more important, different day lengths. differences in induction of genes may have been caused by different critical day length thresholds needed for expression of these genes. in any case, all the genotypes tested in those studies were spring lines, and the interaction of ppdh <dig> with the vernalization pathway in winter genotypes, at gene expression level, remained largely unexplored.

by investigating simultaneously the expression of the flowering response genes, we observed that vrnh <dig> and ppdh <dig> were expressed before vrnh <dig> in all six vernalization-responsive genotypes tested. our results agree with a comparative model proposed by higgins et al.  <cit> . in that scheme, ppdh <dig> promotes vrnh <dig> expression under short-day conditions. we propose that ppdh <dig> has a more general role for winter cultivars, and promotes flowering under all noninductive conditions, i.e. under short days or long days in plants that have not satisfied their vernalization requirement.

this hypothesis is supported by the field trial observations. heading date in our trial occurred from may 10th until july 13th. the photoperiod experienced by the plants increased from  <dig> h  <dig> min at transplanting to  <dig> h  <dig> min when the first genotype reached heading, and then kept increasing until  <dig> h  <dig> min on june 21st. therefore, most of the growth period of the plants occurred in photoperiods well above  <dig> h. we observed a concurrent effect of ppdh <dig> and ppdh <dig> on flowering, which agrees with the concurrent effect for these two genes found under a  <dig> h photoperiod  <cit> . during this period of the year , and even earlier, the effect of long days on heading date in experiments carried out in temperate latitudes can be detected through its effect on ppdh <dig>  <cit> .

heading date was distinctly earlier for winter genotypes that carried the dominant ppdh <dig> allele than for cultivars that possessed the recessive allele. the difference was especially marked for plants that had not been vernalized or had experienced only a short cold period. the  <dig> genotypes used might show some intrinsic difference in earliness per se that might account for some of the differences that could be attributed to ppdh <dig> as the main factor. however, the differences in heading that were caused by ppdh <dig> decreased gradually as the duration of vernalization increased. this interaction between ppdh <dig> and duration of vernalization treatment was quite reliable, and is consistent with the role for ppdh <dig> suggested above. other authors  <cit>  have also reported an effect of ppdh <dig> on flowering time under long photoperiods, but only with the application of synchronous photo and thermo cycles, and when specific allelic configurations are present at the ppdh <dig> and vrnh <dig> loci.

winter genotypes are cultivated normally in areas where they are exposed to sufficient vernalization during winter. as a consequence, these genotypes do not need to express other genes that promote flowering. by contrast, in spring cultivars, ppdh <dig> can facilitate flowering and ensure timely completion of such a short vital cycle. however, in winter cultivars with lower requirements for vernalization, such as those adapted to geographical areas with traditionally mild winters, as exemplified by mediterranean climates, the presence of ppdh <dig> might help to induce flowering when the vernalization requirement has not been satisfied fully . this could explain why the majority of sbcc winter lines carry the dominant ppdh <dig> allele. sbcc winter lines are adapted to a typical mild mediterranean winter, in which temperatures are not very low. if the cold period is insufficiently long to satisfy the vernalization requirement of these genotypes, ppdh <dig> could act as a compensatory mechanism to accelerate flowering and ensure it occurs at the optimal time, possibly before the effect of a sensitive ppdh <dig> is noticeable. in some barley and wheat cultivars the vernalization requirement can be replaced, partially or completely by exposure to short photoperiods  <cit> . this phenomenon, known as short-day vernalization  <cit>  has been reported in barley genotypes with winter alleles in vrnh <dig> and vrnh <dig> and dominant ppdh <dig>  <cit> . in these genotypes, a dual short day-long day induction of flowering could take place  <cit> . this dual mechanism is present in many species, including many festucoideae  <cit> . king and heide  <cit> , proposed that "...as an evolutionary mechanism, the versatility of the alternative short day/vernalization primary induction system offers a beautiful safety mechanism with short days acting as a fall-back alternative in case of inadequate winter chill". the involvement of vrn <dig> in the genetic basis of this mechanism was already put forward by dubcovsky et al.  <cit> , because "the convergence of photoperiod and vernalization signals at the vrn <dig> gene, provides a possible explanation to the interchangeability of short day and vernalization treatments."

the presence of the dominant ppdh <dig> allele would not be necessary under conditions in which vernalization occurred inevitably year after year, as it is common in more northerly latitudes. actually, other authors have claimed that the presence of the dominant allele at ppdh <dig> is not a desirable feature for winter barley  <cit> , because it would induce progress towards flowering too early  <cit> , with undesirable agronomic consequences, including loss of frost tolerance. this may well be true for strict winter cultivars  in more northerly latitudes. the null, late-flowering allele would be more suitable for an autumn-sown cultivar because it would keep plants in the vegetative growth phase longer  <cit> , perhaps through maintaining the expression of genes that confer tolerance to low temperature  <cit> . on the basis of these studies, negative agronomic effects of the dominant ppdh <dig> allele should be investigated, especially in relation to freezing tolerance. however, a dominant ppdh <dig> allele could be a good option for cultivars cultivated in geographic areas where the winters are not that cold. the adaptation syndrome for barley landraces in the iberian peninsula seems to be the combination of an appropriate vrnh <dig> allele with dominant ppdh <dig>  to ensure that flowering will occur before temperature rises too high, and with a dominant ppdh <dig> to ensure that plant growth will be not too delayed even in the years that conditions do not produce full vernalization.

CONCLUSIONS
it is crucial to study the main genes involved in the vernalization and photoperiod pathways simultaneously, because this enables the interactions and functions of these genes to be interpreted more accurately, and their involvement in the induction of flowering to be elucidated.

there is a wide agreement over the central role of vrnh <dig> on the control of the progress of barley towards flowering. nevertheless, different flowering-time responses seem to be modulated by the alleles present at the other vernalization and photoperiod genes vrnh <dig>  vrnh <dig>  ppdh <dig>  and ppdh <dig>  of these genes, ppdh <dig> might have an important role in the regulation of vrnh <dig>  especially under a long photoperiod, by upregulating vrnh <dig> expression and indirectly reducing the time to flower.

ppdh <dig> has a strong effect on heading date in a wide array of winter genotypes. the dominant allele at ppdh <dig> accelerates flowering under long days in plants in which the vernalization requirement has not been satisfied. the presence of ppdh <dig> in most winter landrace-derived lines of the sbcc indicates this allele could promote adaptation to geographic areas with milder winters, such as mediterranean environments.

we also suggest the ppdh2-dependent mechanism proposed in this study could be complementary to the mechanism governed by ppdh <dig>  the sensitive ppdh <dig> allele is typical of winter cultivars and ppdh <dig> is more common in spring cultivars. both mechanisms promote flowering in different environments. furthermore, in mediterranean environments, these two mechanisms could be combined to facilitate flowering in optimal conditions.
