BACKGROUND
mitochondria are thought to be descendants of endosymbiotic bacteria that entered into the host cell  <cit> . the mitochondria of contemporary organisms contain considerably fewer genes than the ancestral bacteria are predicted to have contained. thousand or more mitochondrial proteins are predicted to be encoded in the nucleus  <cit> . such the nucleus-encoded genes are transcribed from eukaryotic promoters, followed by translation into proteins by cytosolic ribosomes. in many cases, the proteins are synthesized as precursors having n-terminal extensions , which act as mitochondrial targeting signals. most of these genes would have been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus at some stage of evolution although some genes may have been recruited from other sources  <cit> . the transferred mitochondrial genes must have acquired cis-regulatory elements compatible with eukaryotic gene expression  signals and sequences for mitochondrial targeting signals) because mitochondrial gene expression is mainly prokaryotic. however, most of the processes for the gene activation remain unknown.

mitochondrial gene content is highly variable depending on the taxa studied. the mammalian mitochondrial genome is conserved and constant all over the groups, whereas within tracheophyta , the genomes exhibit differential gene losses, indicating that gene transfer to the nucleus is an ongoing process during the evolution of magnoliophyta   <cit> . typical such cases are the ribosomal protein genes, showing more frequent gene-loss than other types of mitochondrial gene in many angiosperm species. for example, a sequence homologous to the ribosomal protein l <dig> gene  is absent from all known angiosperm mitochondrial genomes  <cit> , whereas the corresponding sequence is encoded in the mitochondrial genomes of lower plants  <cit> . the sequences of the nucleus-encoded rpl <dig> gene have recently been identified in the complete arabidopsis nuclear genome  <cit>  and the draft rice nuclear genome  <cit> . however, detailed analysis has not yet been performed. we previously reported the loss or dysfunction of several ribosomal protein genes in the complete rice mitochondrial genome  <cit> . we have also isolated several genes that had been transferred from the mitochondrion to the nucleus in rice  <cit> . previous studies, including ours, have revealed frequencies of gene transfer events, the origins of sequence elements, and a few possible mechanisms involved  <cit> . for examples, the rps <dig> gene has undergone numerous independent gene transfer events during recent angiosperm evolution  <cit> . presequences for rice rps11- <dig>  arabidopsis sdh <dig> and carrot rps <dig> genes seem to have been copied from those for the atp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> . common use of a presequence in different proteins via alternative splicing has also been found in maize and rice  <cit> . chromosomal recombinations would have been involved in the gain of a promoter for rice rpl <dig> gene  <cit> . genes are sometimes divided into pieces or functionally replaced: a coding region of rpl <dig> gene has been divided into 5'- and 3'-parts in dicots, either or both of which have been transferred to the nucleus in some species  <cit> ; mitochondrial rps <dig> and rps <dig> genes have been replaced by duplicated copies of chloroplast  and cytosolic counterparts , respectively  <cit> . however, despite these examples, it is mostly unclear how the sequence elements compatible with eukaryotic expression were successfully moved and then joined with the transferred mitochondrial genes.

in this study, we identified and characterized the rice rpl <dig> gene. the release of the complete nuclear sequence of rice  <cit>  and its fine genome annotation  <cit>  enabled us to survey the genes and their genomic environment in detail. based on this information, two copies of rice rpl <dig> gene  were identified in the rice genome. sequence comparison of the two rpl <dig> genes strongly suggests a duplication of the rpl <dig> gene via genomic dna rather than two separate gene transfer events. although the sequences of the two rpl <dig> copies are homologous within the coding regions and have similar mitochondrial targeting properties, osrpl6- <dig> was expressed to a greater extent than osrpl6- <dig>  a region around the 5'-untranslated region  of osrpl6- <dig> is conserved in several other rice sequences. interestingly, this conserved region has characteristics similar to those of class ii transposable elements . it is well established that numerous tes are present in eukaryotic nuclear genomes and that some of them affect genomic rearrangement and gene expression via translocation  <cit> . the te within osrpl6- <dig> would have been involved in the acquisition of the 5'-utr, which may be responsible for the difference in the amount of transcripts produced by the two rpl <dig> genes. the significance of tes for the activation of transferred mitochondrial sequence and the evolution of such processes are discussed.

RESULTS
identification of two copies of the mitochondrial rpl <dig> gene in the rice genome
a blast search of the complete rice nuclear sequence  <cit>  identified two rpl <dig> sequences, osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> . osrpl6- <dig> is a newly described rice rpl <dig> gene, whereas the sequence of osrpl6- <dig> corresponds to that of a previously reported one  <cit> . the osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> genes are assigned to chromosomes   <dig> and  <dig> as loci os03g <dig> and os08g <dig>  respectively, in the rice annotation project database  build  <dig>  <cit> . each of the osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> genes is transcribed because cdna sequence corresponding to each gene is found in the database  . each gene has an intron in an identical position within the 5'-utr , as is the case for arabidopsis rpl <dig>  <cit> . the coding regions of the two rice rpl <dig> genes, each of which is predicted to encode a protein consisting of  <dig> amino acids, have 92% nucleotide sequence identity. because the 3'-terminal regions of the intron showed 65% identity in the two rice rpl <dig> , they were probably generated by a duplication event via genomic dna after gene transfer to the nucleus, rather than by two separate transfer events.

mitochondrial targeting of osrpl <dig> gene products
in contrast to the mitochondrial rpl <dig> proteins of lower plants  <cit> , the predicted proteins of the two rice rpl <dig> genes did not contain n-terminal extensions for presequences. although the arabidopsis rpl <dig> gene  <cit>  and all the other spermatophyta  rpl <dig> cdnas in the database also lack any coding capacity for presequences , localization of the rpl <dig> protein has not been studied. we examined the subcellular localization of rpl <dig> using green fluorescent protein . a construct, in which the n-terminal coding region of osrpl6- <dig> was fused to synthetic gfp cdna  <cit> , exhibited fluorescence in particles of about  <dig> Î¼m in diameter . these particles coincided with the fluorescence of a mitochondrial-specific dye, mitotracker red , indicating that the protein was imported into the mitochondria. a construct containing the n-terminal coding region of osrpl6- <dig> gave similar results . in contrast, a construct containing the c-terminal coding region of osrpl6- <dig> did not localize proteins to the mitochondria . these results indicate that the mature n-terminal coding regions of rice rpl <dig> proteins are important for mitochondrial localization.

differential expression of rice rpl <dig> genes
we examined the transcription of the osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> genes using reverse transcription-pcr . because of difficulty in designing primers specific for each rpl <dig> gene, osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> cdnas were amplified using a common primer pair, p7/p <dig> , followed by restriction digestion to distinguish between their products . the rt-pcr analysis showed that amplification of osrpl6- <dig> cdna was much lower than that of osrpl6- <dig> cdna . this indicates that the two rpl <dig> genes differ in the amount of transcripts produced.

the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> is homologous to various rice sequences
in contrast to the similar coding sequences of the two rpl <dig> copies, their 5'-noncoding regions differ near the center of the intron . a database search was conducted to determine the origin of these 5'-sequences. there are several sequences homologous the region around the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig>  in the rice genome. these sequences are distributed on all rice chromosomes . additional homologous sequences may be revealed when divergent and fragmented sequences are taken into account. the homology starts upstream from the 5'-end of osrpl6- <dig> cdna  and extends into the 5'-part of the intron. the chrs 4a, 5c and 12a lack about  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp of sequences from the beginning of the conserved region, respectively, probably because of subsequent deletion events. the gt dinucleotide at the 5'-border of the osrpl6- <dig> intron is also conserved in all the chr sequences , except for chr 4a. eleven of these sequences  are transcribed and spliced at this site because their corresponding cdnas are present in the database  . in addition, we detected another conserved dna segment downstream of the above-mentioned homologies in  <dig> sequences  . in osrpl6- <dig>  this downstream conserved segment is located near the center of the intron, upstream of the sequence homologous in the two rpl <dig> genes .

conserved regions have characteristics of a transposable element 
the upstream  and downstream  conserved segments are presently annotated in the database as members of two separate nonautonomous tes, mermite18f and ecsr  <cit> , respectively, but they have not been characterized in detail. sequence alignment and analysis of the two conserved segments revealed the following.  the segments have a common terminal inverted repeat  composed of a 15-bp consensus sequence, ggccttgttcggttg .  a potential 3-bp direct repeat occurs just outside of the tir . although not all direct repeats were perfectly conserved between the ends of the sequences, they could represent target-site duplications , which are generally caused by te insertions.  a database search using the sequences flanking the conserved segments detected two putative related-to-empty-sites . the resites are sequences that are homologous to te-bearing sequences but lack the te insertion, which indicates the past movement of tes and their tsd sequences  <cit> . in one instance, the sequence flanking chr 2b was nearly identical to that of its resite . in the second instance, high homology was evident between chr 9c and its resite, although a few indels were observed . these results strongly suggest that the two conserved segments were moved as a single te because the insertion of two such segments in such close proximity and in the same direction by two separate events is highly unlikely.

classification of tes associated with the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> as a member of the pif/harbinger superfamily
among the putative tes re-characterized in this study, proteins predicted from the internal regions of chrs 2c, 5c and 9b had 78%â88% similarity to a transposase from os-pif <dig> . the os-pif <dig> is a rice homologue of maize p instability factor alpha , an active class ii dna transposon  <cit> . the pif family has recently been associated with the nonautonomous miniature inverted transposable element , tourist  <cit> . in fact, the consensus tir sequence of the putative tes observed in our study   was similar to that of tourist-like mites in maize, barley and sorghum  <cit>  and ospif families  <cit> . these results indicate that the conserved sequence segments associated with the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> are a single te belonging to the pif/harbinger superfamily. of these tes, chr 2c seems to encode an entire transposase, whereas chr 5c and 9b may be pseudogenes because of lacking the complete coding region for transposase. the others, including one within osrpl6- <dig>  are probably nonautonomous elements because they did not contain orfs nor did their predicted proteins have significant homologies to any characterized proteins in the given direction .

discussion
based on the results of this study, we propose a model for the gene transfer and subsequent events of rice rpl <dig> .

 <dig>  gene transfer of rpl <dig> from the mitochondrion to the nucleus
it has been proposed that a mitochondrially encoded rpl <dig> gene had been transferred to the nucleus prior to the emergence of angiosperms  <cit> . we assume that the transfer already occurred in the common ancestor of seed plants  because the rpl <dig> gene is absent from the mitochondrial genome of a gymnosperm, cycas taitungensis  <cit> . in addition, rpl <dig> cdnas are found from gymnosperms cryptomeria japonica, cycas rumphii, pinus pinaster, pseudotsuga menziesii and zamia vazquezii in the database , although the presence of rpl <dig> cdnas does not readily indicate the nuclear localization of genes. this situation differs from the evolution of other ribosomal protein genes, which underwent recent gene transfer events during the course of angiosperm evolution   <cit> .

 <dig>  gain of a mitochondrial targeting sequence and an intron
since neither of the proteins predicted from the two rice rpl <dig> genes contained an apparent n-terminal extension for a presequence, the targeting signal seems to have been derived from sequence alterations within the mature n-terminal coding region , as with the case of rice rps <dig>  <cit> . the presence of an embedded targeting signal here was indicated by the results of gfp assays . during the gfp analysis, small aggregations were occasionally observed . we speculate that the efficiency of mitochondrial targeting varies according to cellular or physiological conditions. incomplete or slow protein targeting has been observed in the sweet potato atpase Î´-subunit with an atypical mitochondrial targeting signal  <cit> . at any rate, the acquisition of the targeting signal would have occurred prior to the duplication event because both rice rpl <dig> proteins have similar mitochondrial targeting abilities. this step may predate the common ancestor of seed plants because seed plants rpl <dig> proteins seem to lack a presequence as described. the 3'-part of an intron would also have been acquired during this step, based on the fact that both of the osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> sequences share a similarity in the 3'-terminal region of the intron .

 <dig>  duplication of the nuclear rpl <dig> gene
the rpl <dig> gene would have been duplicated via genomic dna, resulting in two rpl <dig> copies  on different chromosomes . although we did not conduct southern blot analysis to determine their copy numbers, the presence of the two rpl <dig> copies in the rice nucleus is probable because of the accuracy of rice genome sequence data  <cit>  and similarity to numerous rpl <dig> cdna sequences in the database . the duplication event seems to have occurred after the split of the genus oryza from the other monocots, followed by the occurrence of japonica and indica subspecies, because cdna sequences corresponding to osrpl6- <dig> and osrpl6- <dig> are also present in the indica cultivar  but not in other monocots . this assumption is supported by a maximum likelihood  tree based on the  <dig> nonredundant rpl <dig> cdnas from  <dig> angiosperm genera . this ml tree also suggests relatively recent duplications in glycine, hordeum, ipomoea, petunia and triticum. therefore, it is likely that multiple duplication events occurred during angiosperm evolution.

 <dig>  acquisition of the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> via a te
despite their coding similarity, transcripts of osrpl6- <dig> were much less abundant than those of osrpl6- <dig> . the difference in the quantity of transcripts produced by the rpl <dig> genes might be caused by differences in promoter regions because their 5'-noncoding regions differ from a point near the center of the intron . the most striking findings of this study were that numerous sequences homologous to the region around the 5'-utr of osrpl6- <dig> were detected in the rice genome and that they presumably belong to a te family. one can raise a question why numerous putative introns linked to the tes are spread in the rice genome. one speculation could be that a te was selected as part of the intron of a cellular gene because it contained a functional element such as a promoter or an enhancer, followed by amplification in the rice genome via transpositions. alternatively, a te might have selfishly been spread in the rice genome after capture of the 5'-part of intron from an unknown gene source. the evolutionary relationships of these tes are unclear because the presence of a number of indels in the sequence alignment  precludes fine phylogenetic analysis. these tes might have been transposed at a relatively early evolutionary stage because most of their resites are missing. this assumption does not contradict the notion of ancient transfer of the rpl <dig> gene to the nucleus  <cit> . however, the te within osrpl6- <dig> should have been integrated after the duplication event of the rice rpl <dig> gene  because the osrpl6- <dig> and arabidopsis rpl <dig> genes lack such a sequence. the origin and mode of acquisition of the osrpl6- <dig> 5'-utr is unknown. there is a mutator-like element  within the 5'-nontranscribed spacer region of osrpl6- <dig> . this element seems to have been acquired posteriorly. such nested te insertions are characteristic of many kinds of tes. we infer that this mule has a minor effect on the expression of osrpl6- <dig> because it is not conserved among the contemporary transcribed tes . alternatively, the mule might act as an enhancer.

the 5'-utr and intron within the 5'-utr are generally thought to contain cis-elements that regulate expression at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels: the former involves promoter and enhancer activities and the latter confers translational efficiency and mrna stability  <cit> . the evolutionary origins of noncoding regions  are mostly unknown, as are those of nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes. recently, topoisomerase i-mediated homologous recombination has been proposed as a mechanism by which the 5'-utr was acquired in rice rpl <dig>  <cit> . in the present report, we describe a novel mechanism for the acquisition of a 5'-utr via a te. tes sometimes transpose in the vicinity of host genes, generating new coding regions and changing gene expression  <cit> . among the tes, mites may be sources of cis-acting regulatory elements because of their specific properties. first, mites are much more prevalent than other types of tes in plant genomes. second, they preferentially insert into genic regions. finally, mites might contain cis-acting elements. although most of such putative elements have not been demonstrated experimentally, a mite family that had provided a poly  signal has been reported  <cit> . in addition, it is noteworthy that insertions of a member of the mite family, mping, may have caused the up- and down-regulation of adjacent genes in rice  <cit> . we have not determined which cis-acting element causes differences in the amount of transcripts between the two rice rpl <dig> genes . however, many reports have already established that the 5'-utr and intron within the 5'-utr have promoter and enhancer activity. as an alternative hypothesis, it is also possible to assume that the rice rpl <dig> gene gained basal transcriptional machinery prior to the gene duplication event  because both of the rice rpl <dig> copies are transcribed. in this case, the te within osrpl6- <dig> might act as an enhancer.

despite some functional ambiguity, judging from the lines of evidence presented here, our results constitute a plausible explanation for the origin and acquisition of the 5'-noncoding region. the generality of the acquisition of a 5'-utr via a te is unclear because of the paucity of genomic information on rpl <dig> genes in other monocots and because many tes are often poorly conserved except for tirs and tsds. in fact, we examined the structure of the tes that retain the entire tir and are transcribed , but failed to find any analogous case of osrpl6- <dig>  their transcripts ended within a region between the tir  and no association with any other proximal genes was predicted. therefore, to our knowledge, the osrpl6- <dig> is presently the only example. additional genomic data on other plant species and further systematic searches may reveal analogous cases of other transferred mitochondrial genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated the evolutionary origin and acquisition mechanism of the 5'-utr of a transferred mitochondrial gene. we conclude that the 5'-utr of the transferred rpl <dig> gene was acquired via a te. since the 5'-utr and intron within the 5'-utr generally contain transcriptional and posttranscriptional cis-elements, tes may have constituted sources of cis-elements for the transferred mitochondrial genes.
