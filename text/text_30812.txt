BACKGROUND
dna transposons are natural genetic elements residing in the genome as repetitive sequences. a simple transposon is organized by terminal repeat domains  embracing a gene encoding a catalytic protein, transposase, required for its relocation in the genome through a "cut-and-paste" mechanism. since the first discovery of dna transposons in maize by barbara#mcclintock in  <dig>  <cit> , transposons have been used extensively as genetic tools in invertebrates and in plants for transgenesis and insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . such tools, however, have not been available for genome manipulations in vertebrates or mammals until the reactivation of a tc1/mariner-like element, sleeping beauty, from fossils in the salmonid fish genome  <cit> . since its awakening, sleeping beauty has been used as a tool for versatile genetic applications ranging from transgenesis to functional genomics and gene therapy in vertebrates including fish, frogs, mice, rats and humans  <cit> . subsequently, naturally existing transposons, such as tol <dig> and piggybac, have also been shown to effectively transpose in vertebrates.

the medaka fish  tol <dig>  belonging to the hat family of transposons, is the first known naturally occurring active dna transposon discovered in vertebrate genomes  <cit> . tol <dig> is a standard tool for manipulating zebrafish genomes and has been demonstrated to transpose effectively in frog, chicken, mouse and human cells as well  <cit> . recent studies found that tol <dig> is an effective tool both for transgenesis via pronuclear microinjection and germline insertional mutagenesis in mice  <cit> . cabbage looper moth  piggybac is the founder of the piggybac superfamily and is widely used for mutagenesis and transgenesis in insects  <cit> . recently, piggybac was shown to be highly active in mouse and human cells and has emerged as a promising vector system for chromosomal integration, including insertional mutagenesis in mice and nuclear reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to induced-pluripotent stem cells  <cit> .

to date, most gene therapy trials have utilized viral vectors for permanent gene transfer due to their high transduction rate and their ability to integrate therapeutic genes into host genomes for stable expression. however, serious problems associated with most viral vectors, such as limited cargo capacity, host immune response, and oncogenic insertions  highlight an urgent need for developing effective non-viral therapeutic gene delivery systems  <cit> . recently, sleeping beauty, tol <dig>  and piggybac transposon-based vector systems have been explored for their potential use in gene therapy with proven successes  <cit> . however, for therapeutic purposes, a large cargo capacity is often required. the transposition efficiency of sleeping beauty is reduced in a size-dependent manner with 50% reduction in its activity when the size of the transposon reaches  <dig> kb  <cit> . tol <dig> and piggybac, however, are able to integrate up to  <dig> and  <dig>  kb of foreign dna into the host genome, respectively, without a significant reduction in their transposition activity  <cit> . additionally, by a direct comparison, we have observed that tol <dig> and piggybac are highly active in all mammalian cell types tested, unlike sb <dig> , which exhibits a moderate and tissue-dependent activity  <cit> . because of their high cargo capacity and high transposition activity in a broad range of vertebrate cell types, piggybac and tol <dig> are two promising tools for basic genetic studies and preclinical experimentation. our goal here was to evaluate the pros and cons of piggybac and tol <dig> for the use in gene therapy and gene discovery by performing a side-by-side comparison of both transposon systems. in this study, we reported for the first time the identification of the shortest effective piggybac trds as well as several piggybac and tol <dig> hotspots. we also observed that piggybac and tol <dig> display non-overlapping targeting preferences, which makes them complementary research tools for manipulating mammalian genomes. furthermore, piggybac appears to be the most promising vector system for achieving specific targeting of therapeutic genes due to a robust enzymatic activity of the piggybac transposase and flexibility the transposase displays towards molecular engineering. finally, results of our in-depth analyses of piggybac target sequences highlight the need to first scrutinize the piggybac favored target sites for the therapeutic cell type of interest before designing a customized dna binding protein for fusing with the piggybac transposase to achieve site-specific therapeutic gene targeting.

RESULTS
transposition activity of piggybac and tol <dig> in mammalian cells
with the ultimate goal of identifying and targeting safe sites in the genome at which to insert corrective genes, we previously explored three active mammalian transposases, piggybac, tol <dig> and sb <dig>  for their sensitivity to molecular modification  <cit> . after fusing the gal <dig> dna binding domain to the n-terminus of the three transposases, we only detected a slight change in the activity of the piggybac transposase, whereas the same modification nearly abolished the activity of tol <dig> and sb <dig>  <cit> . a recent genetic screen has yielded a novel hyperactive sleeping beauty transposase  that was shown to be more active than piggybac under restrictive conditions that support their peak activity  <cit> . however, in this study we chose to focus on piggybac and tol <dig> but not sleeping beauty for the following reasons:  all of the reported attempts to modify the sb <dig> transposase either n- or c-terminally result in a complete elimination or a significant reduction in transposase activity;  sleeping beauty is more susceptible to over expression inhibition than piggybac and tol2;  the cargo capacity of sleeping beauty is limited; and  unlike tol <dig> and piggybac that are active in all mammalian cell types tested, sleeping beauty display cell-type dependent activity  <cit> .

we have demonstrated that piggybac and tol <dig> display high transposition activity in several cell lines  <cit> . we now wish to explore the possibility of further enhancing their activity by trimming non-essential sequences from both transposons. using a pcr-based strategy we generated ppb-cassette3short with the shortest trds reported replacing the long ones of the pxlbacii-cassette   <cit> . similarly, based on the previous report, a new tol <dig> donor, ptol2mini-cassette, with minimal terminal repeats  <cit>  replacing the long ones of tol2ends-cassette was also constructed . the new helper plasmids of piggybac  and tol <dig>  were also constructed by placing cdna of piggybac and tol <dig> transposases, respectively, in the bi-cistronic transcriptional unit with gfp driven by the cmv promoter in the pprig vector  . to compare the transposition activity of the long versus short version of piggybac and tol <dig>  the piggybac or tol <dig> donor with either long or short trds was co-transfected with its helper plasmid into hek  <dig> cells. the transfected cells were subjected to a chromosomal transposition assay  to determine their transposition activity. removing the majority of the terminal repeat sequences of piggybac and tol <dig> resulted in a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase in transposition activity as compared to their wild-type counterparts . given that the sizes of the piggybac and tol <dig> donor plasmids are reduced by  <dig> -and  <dig> - fold, respectively, the observed increases in transposition activity for piggybac and tol <dig> are in effect  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold when normalized by the number of donor molecules transfected. true transpositions of ppb-cassette3short and ptol2mini-cassette in hek  <dig> were further confirmed by retrieving chromosomal sequences flanking their target site .

in order to further explore their potential to be modified by molecular engineering, we myc tagged the n-terminus of the piggybac transposase  and ha tagged both the n- or c-terminus of the tol <dig> transposase  . by co-transfecting ppb-cassette3short, and the helper plasmid expressing either wild-type or the chimeric piggybac transposase into hek  <dig> cells, we observed a slight increase in activity with the myc-piggybac as compared to its wild type counterpart . an increase in activity after molecular modifications was also observed in several of our piggybac chimeras including the gal4-piggybac which displayed a fluctuated activity that was sometimes higher than the wild-type piggybac transposase . similar approaches, however, demonstrated that fusing the ha tag to either end of the tol <dig> transposase almost completely eliminated its activity .

to evaluate the activity of the piggybac transposase, we then transfected a fixed amount of piggybac donors  with a various amount of helper plasmids bearing myc-tagged piggybac transposases  into hek  <dig>  piggybac transposition activity increases as the amount of piggybac transposases increase until reaching its peak in cells transfected with  <dig> ng of helper plasmids . as the amount of piggybac transposases were reduced to the level barely detected by western blotting, 68% of the transposition activity at its peak was still retained , suggesting that piggybac transposase is highly active.

a global evaluation of tol <dig> and piggybac targeting preferences in the human genome
genome-wide target profiling of piggybac and tol <dig> in the human genome has been reported recently  <cit> . however, all these studies were based on data sets obtained by retrieving chromosomal targeting sequences from a mixed population of transposon targeted cells or using a pcr-based strategy. to fully explore their potential as mammalian genome manipulation tools for gene therapy and gene discovery, reliable data sets of target sequence preferences based on targeting sequences retrieved form independent integrants are needed for genome-wide target profiling of piggybac and tol <dig> in the human genome. in this regard, as for piggybac, we co-transfected pxlbacii-cassette and pprig-piggybac into hek  <dig> cells. likewise, tol2ends-cassette and pprig-tol <dig> were co-transfected into hek  <dig> for tol <dig>  the transfected cells were subjected to colony formation under hygromycin selection at a low density enabling for isolating individual colonies without cross-contamination . hygromycin-resistant colonies for piggybac and tol <dig> were individually cloned and further expanded. genomic dna isolated from individual clones was subjected to plasmid rescue for obtaining chromosomal dna flanking the transposon insertion sites. we have isolated  <dig> and  <dig> individual colonies for tol <dig> and piggybac, respectively . a total of  <dig> and  <dig> independent plasmids were respectively rescued from  <dig> tol <dig> and  <dig> piggybac colonies  and subsequently sequenced. only  <dig> and  <dig> of piggybac and tol <dig> targets resulted in a sequence of sufficient quality to execute a blat search against the human genome database in the ucsc genome browser  <cit> . among these,  <dig> piggybac and  <dig> tol <dig> targeting sequences had a strong match  to human genomic sequences .

*: only the target sequences sharing ≥95% sequence identity with the corresponding human genome were selected

based on the established data sets , we performed target profiling of piggybac and tol <dig> in the hek  <dig> genome. tol <dig> and piggybac display non-overlapping targeting profiles, with targets scattered over the entire genome . although tol <dig> targets were detected in all  <dig> human chromosomes , no piggybac targets were found in chromosome  <dig> . interestingly, clusters of tol <dig> targets within a  <dig> kb interval are often detected , whereas no such clusters are apparent for piggybac. tol <dig> predominately targets intergenic regions , whereas more than half of the piggybac targets are located within known genes  . with respect to intragenic targeting preferences, both piggybac and tol <dig> favorably target the introns of known genes and no piggybac target is found within the orf of a gene. regarding the target distribution in the utr region, piggybac displays a skew towards the 3' utr, while no such bias can be seen in tol <dig> . finally, consistent with previous reports  <cit> , both piggybac and tol <dig> have a significant bias for integrating close to cpg islands, as compared to the computer simulated random integrations, with a higher bias detected in piggybac than in tol <dig> .

to measure the distributions of piggybac and tol <dig> targets with regards to the gene density around the target sites, we counted the number of genes located within a  <dig> kb interval on either side of their target sites. by this analysis, tol <dig> tends to target to regions with lower gene densities, particularly favoring regions with one to two genes located within a  <dig> kb window on either side of the insertion site .

we next determined the targeting preferences of piggybac and tol <dig> to different types of repeats in the human genome. up to  <dig> % of tol <dig> targets were found within repeats, particularly lines . the frequency of targeting to repeats by piggybac was  <dig> %, with a slight preference for sines. no piggybac targets were detected in satellite and rdna. repetitive sequences are stretches of dna with similar sequences, and are found in numerous locations in the genome. it is possible that if one transposon displays a lower degree of sequence constraints for targeting than the other one, it may be able to target repeats more frequently than the other one. based on this assumption and the fact that the sequences flanking the 3' end are significantly more important than that flanking the 5' end for both piggybac and tol <dig> target sites as determined by the sequence logo analysis detailed later , we then applied sequence constraints to further address the targeting pattern of both transposons to different repeats. in this analysis, we only counted the inserts located at the site within and more than  <dig> bp upstream to the 3' end of targeted repeats . by applying this sequence constrain, the frequency of targeting repeats decrease much more dramatically in piggybac than in tol <dig> for the majority of repeat types  suggesting that piggybac may display a higher degree of sequence constrains than tol <dig> in selecting their target sites.

sequence analyses of tol <dig> and piggybac target sites
to analyze the sequence preference for piggybac and tol <dig> targeting, we generated sequence logos for both transposon systems . consistent with previous reports, the characteristic ttaa tetranucleotide was exclusively found at the piggybac target sites. although no specific signature could be detected at tol <dig> target sites, a weak but significant preference was observed in the first 10~ <dig> bp 3' flanking the target site. next, we searched for sites that are repeatedly targeted by either piggybac or tol <dig>  five and six sequences targeted repeatedly by piggybac and tol <dig>  respectively, were identified . and four out of  <dig>  independent tol <dig> targeting events occurred at the same position located within the intron of signal-regulatory protein delta .

to further explore the nature of target site selection by piggybac and tol <dig>  we performed a series of in-depth analyses on their target sequences. by conducting a blat search against the ucsc genome browser database   <cit> , we identified  <dig> piggybac and  <dig> tol <dig> targeting sequences which have at least the first  <dig> bp nucleotides 3' to the target site share more than 97% sequence identity with other sequences in the genome . surprisingly,  <dig> of the  <dig> tol <dig> targets were located within repeats, but none of the  <dig> piggybac targets was . again this observation may reflect a higher degree of sequence constrains in target site selection for piggybac than for tol <dig>  further analyses are required to reveal the nature of this discrepancy.

to study the nature of piggybac target specificity, we next examined the neighboring sequences around five piggybac hotspots. we observed that several ttaa tetranucleotides are located within a  <dig> bp interval of two piggybac hotspots. the target sequences in b102- <dig> and b38- <dig> are identical and contain three ttaa tetranucleotides within a  <dig> bp interval upstream of the actual piggybac ttaa target . similarly, the sequence of another piggybac hotspot , contains three ttaa tetranucleotides within the  <dig> bp interval downstream of the genuine ttaa piggybac target site. a blat search has identified another sequence which is located  <dig>  mb away and shares  <dig> % sequence identity with the target site of b92- <dig> and b75- <dig>  as detailed in the lower sequence of figure 5b, a g  to a substitution is identified at + <dig> on the other sequence where the piggybac target site is designated as  <dig> 

the fact that piggybac targeted repeatedly to the same ttaa but not the adjacent ttaa tetranucleotides or to the ttaa site on another highly identical sequence nearby raise the possibility that the genuine ttaa piggybac targets may be determined by some intrinsic sequence constraints flanking the target site. to further address this possibility, we focused on two other piggybac target sequences, the b89- <dig> and b87- <dig> . by a blat search, we identified four sequences on chromosome  <dig> that share 100% sequence identity with one of the piggybac hotspot as in b89- <dig> and b77- <dig> . we then performed a multiple sequence alignment on these four sequences. although the primary sequence of these four sequences with a 200-bp interval on either side of the ttaa target site is almost identical, both b89- <dig> and b77- <dig> target to the same ttaa tetranucleotide on the top but not the other three similar sequences in figure 5c. another example, b87- <dig>  was found to share at least 97% sequence identity with  <dig> sequences elsewhere in the human genome, yet none of these highly similar sequences were targeted by piggybac . to gain further insight into the nature of piggybac target selection, we retrieved the top  <dig> sequences that share 99% sequence identity with the first  <dig> bp of the b87- <dig> target. as revealed by the sequence logo analysis, the primary sequence of these  <dig> sequences is highly conserved . by designating the first t of ttaa as + <dig>  the conserved a at - <dig> and c at + <dig> are changed to c and t, respectively, in the b87- <dig> target. collectively, these observations strongly suggest that piggybac does not target arbitrarily to any ttaa tetranucleotide in the human genome but rather to the ttaa sites in a specific sequence context.

the activity of genes nearby the piggybac and tol <dig> hotspots
genome-wide targeting analyses of retroviruses have revealed their biased nature in preferentially targeting to active regions of the host chromatin. to address whether gene activity had an influence on target preferences of piggybac and tol <dig>  we performed quantitative rt-pcr  analyses, focusing mainly on genes located within or within a  <dig> kb interval from either tol <dig> or piggybac hotspots. the house keeping gene gapdh and three neural genes with a broad range of expression levels in hek  <dig>  <cit>  were selected to serve as references for q-rt-pcr analyses. it is impossible to assess the relative abundance of difference genes by directly comparing the q-rt-pcr signal between various primer pairs. hence, we designed the primer pair within the same exon for each gene. the expression level for each gene was then evaluated by the ratio of the relative copy number derived from q-rt-pcr and that derived from quantitative pcr  by using the same primer pair on mrna and the genomic dna of hek  <dig>  respectively. most of the genes tested were either not expressed or expressed at a much lower level as compared to gadph . notably, sirpd, the gene containing the most frequently targeted tol <dig> hotspots was barely expressed in hek  <dig> . hence, it is highly likely that gene activity has no influence on the hotspot selection of piggybac and tol <dig>  indeed we have recently identified a piggybac hotspot located at a gene that is silenced in hek  <dig> .

risk assessment of targeting within or near cancer-related genes by piggybac and tol2
random insertion mutagenesis is a real threat to gene therapy  <cit> . the mutagenic potential caused by random insertions of any transposon remains the greatest concern for their advancement to clinical applications. in this regard, we assessed the risk of tol <dig> and piggybac for their potential of inducing oncogenesis by counting the number of piggybac or tol <dig> targets located either directly within or within a defined distance of a cancer-related gene. the frequency of targeting to sites within either a 400-kb or 1000-kb distance from cancer-related genes was significantly higher in piggybac than in tol <dig> . however, the frequency of targeting within a cancer-related gene was higher in tol <dig> than in piggybac . cancer related genes targeted by tol <dig> or piggybac are listed in table  <dig>  notably, piggybac targeted twice to the same site within one particular cancer-related gene, gephyrin , raising a great concern for its safe use in gene therapy  <cit> .

discussion
the longer the foreign sequences introduced into the host genome, the greater the probability of evoking adverse consequences, such as transgene silencing and dysregulation of the endogenous genes nearby. hence, for both basic research and clinical applications, a transposon system with smallest terminal repeats for genetic manipulations is desired. by removing most of the nonfunctional sequences of piggybac and tol <dig> trds, we observed a  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increase in transposition activity for piggybac and tol <dig>  respectively. the increase in transposition activity for both piggybac and tol <dig> is unlikely to be due to their reduction in size, since the piggybac element in the pxlbacii-cassette and the tol <dig> element in the tol2ends-cassette are both within their maximal cargo capacity of  <dig>  kb and  <dig> kb, respectively  <cit> . in general, the transposition activity of a transposon negatively correlates with the fitness of the host. although in most cases the activity of transposons in the host is abolished due to mutations and deletions, some transposons are intact but are completely silenced epigenetically by host defense mechanisms  <cit> . for example, rnai is the mechanism for silencing the tc <dig> dna transposon in the germ line of caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> . unlike pxl-bacii-cassette only consisting of  <dig> bp-left and  <dig> bp-right trd, the tol2end-cassette preserves most of the non-coding cis sequences of the wild-type tol <dig> transposon. these "non-essential sequences" may be susceptible to epigenetic silencing and in turn attenuate their transposition activity. this possibility may explain why extra cis sequences in tol2ends-cassette has a greater impact in deregulating transposition activity than that of pxlbacii-cassette. this observation further implicates the possible interaction between epigenetic silencing factors and the cis sequence of wild-type transposons, and for tol <dig> in particular. studies are now underway to address this possibility.

unlike our findings that ppb-cassette3short with short trds at the ends results in a higher activity than its long counterpart in hek  <dig>  attempts to transform d. melanogaster with p-bac-eyfp consisting of 35-bp 3'trd and 63-bp 5'trd yielded transformation frequencies far less than full-length piggybac constructs   <cit> . this discrepancy may simply reflect the differences in the components and/or the mechanism involved in transposition between mammalian and insect cells. it is also possible that the extra  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides included in our 3'- and 5'-trd, respectively, are crucial for an effective transposition. another important feature of our functional piggybac terminal sequences  is that most of the activator sequences  identified previously in d. melanogaster  <cit>  are excluded. in this respect, the micro-pb may potentially be a safer cis-piggybac element as a mammalian genetic tool as compared to the minimal piggybac cis-sequence identified previously. studies are now underway to address whether micro-pb exhibits any enhancer or silencer activity.

genome-wide targeting profiles of piggybac and tol <dig> in the human genome have been previously reported  <cit> . all of these analyses utilized chromosomal target sequences that were retrieved either by plasmid rescue from a heterogenous population of targeted cells or by pcr-based strategies using a limited amount of genomic dna isolated from individual targeted clones grown on 96-well plates. several factors may introduce strong biases into the data sets obtained in these studies including  differences in proliferation rates of the individual targeted cells,  intrinsic difficulties in retrieving certain targeting sequences, and  biases in obtaining pcr products from certain templates but not from the others. hence, to fully evaluate the pros and cons of piggybac and tol <dig> for gene discovery and gene therapy, a direct comparison of their genome-wide targeting profile based on reliable data sets obtained within the same experimental setting was needed. to achieve this goal, we utilized a labor intensive strategy involving isolating, expending, and performing plasmid rescue to retrieve chromosomal targeting sequences for each individual hek  <dig> clone targeted. based on the following observations, we believe the data sets established in this study provides reliable insights into the targeting profiles of piggybac and tol <dig>  first, we successfully rescued plasmids from 87% and 91% of piggybac and tol <dig> targeted clones, and the majority of clones that were not rescued were due to a lack of sufficient genome dna for performing plasmid rescue. second, several copies of an identical plasmid were often obtained in the same targeted clones, suggesting that most, if not all, inserts in the same clones were successfully recovered. third, for each individual clone targeted, we normally obtained 1- <dig> different inserts, consistent with a recent report that the copy number of tol <dig> and piggybac in hela cells ranges between 1- <dig> and 1- <dig>  respectively  <cit> . identifying targeted sites in individual clones has led to the identification of piggybac and tol <dig> hotspots and allowed us to perform a detailed and unbiased analysis on target site preferences for both transposon systems.

all piggybac and tol <dig> hotspots identified in this study are likely to be bona fide given the following reasons. first, the protocol  used to isolate individual targeted clones is intentionally designed to avoid cross-contamination between individual drug-resistant colonies. second, all of the target sequences in this study were retrieved using plasmid rescue rather than a pcr-based strategy. a small amount of contaminating genomic dna, if any, is not sufficient for a successful plasmid rescue. third, the four tol <dig> targets mapped to the hotspot located in the sirpd locus were derived from two separate experiments suggesting the occurrence of independent targeting events at this particular site in the hek  <dig> genome. finally, all of the piggybac and tol <dig> clones with a hotspot targeted contain additional integrations mapped to distinct chromosomal locations , indicating all of these targeted clones were indeed independent. our analyses of tol <dig> have revealed a distinct global targeting distribution among  <dig> human chromosomes in hek  <dig>  which stands in sharp contrast to the reported tol <dig> distribution in hela cells . distinct tol <dig> genome-wide targeting profiles in hek  <dig> and hela cells seem to reflect their difference in frequency of targeting to different genomic contexts. for instance, our analyses revealed  <dig> % and  <dig> % of tol <dig> intronic and exonic targeting frequency in hek  <dig>  respectively , while the reported intronic and exonic targeting rate of tol <dig> in hela cells are  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively . discrepancies in the frequency of tol <dig> targeting to various repeat types between our study and others were also detected. two factors may account for the observed discrepancies: namely  differences in strategies, and  differences in tol <dig> targeting preferences in hek  <dig> and hela cells. the former factor should not substantially contribute to the great difference in targeting preferences seen in the two separate studies, since even if one approach is less biased than the other, a certain degree of overlapping in tol <dig> target distributions should still be detected in both human cell types. however, this is not the case. hence, the non-overlapping tol <dig> target profiles are likely due to differences in cell types. as for piggybac, although its intragenic target rate in this study  and in other studies  is similar, we observed a much higher frequency of piggybac targeting to untranslated regions in hek  <dig>  than what was observed in primary t cells  . additionally, we fail to detect any piggybac targets that are found both in hek <dig>  and in human t cells  <cit> . unlike the data set established in this study, the genome-wide piggybac targets in primary t-cells were obtained from a heterogenous population of piggybac targeted clones  <cit> . consequently, the data set obtained from primary t-cells is inevitably biased to the target sites that are easily retrieved by plasmid rescue, a factor that may contribute significantly to the sharp contrast in the targeting profiles of piggybac observed in the two different cell types. however, our data set revealed five piggybac hotspots in hek  <dig> and yet no target in our data set is found in that of primary t cells, suggesting cell type differences may still be the major contributing factors when explaining these observed differences. furthermore, these differences were likely to be amplified by the fact that unlike t-primary cells which contain normal  <dig> chromosomes, hek  <dig> is a transformed cell line with an aberrant karyotype of  <dig> chromosomes as characterized originally. collectively, comparisons of our data with that of others highlights the necessity for  obtaining a reliable data set for genome-wide target analyses  and  re-evaluating the genome-wide target profile of transposons  in the specific stem cell type of therapeutic interest before advancing them to clinical uses.

the reliable data sets obtained in this study allow us to perform in-depth sequence analyses of their targets without ambiguity. the sequence logo of tol <dig> detected subtle but significant information present within the first  <dig> base pairs on the 3' end of tol <dig> target sites. furthermore, as indicated in table  <dig> despite the fact that the target sequence of the most frequently targeted tol <dig> hotspot  is actually located within lines and shares more than 97% sequence identity with two other sequences in the genome, tol <dig> only targeted to this particular site but not to other similar sequences. collectively, these observations strongly suggest even though no distinct features of tol <dig> target sequences can be readily identified, tol <dig>  like piggybac, also targets in a selective manner in the host genome. the in-depth sequence analyses also revealed the following important features of piggybac targeting preference:  ttaa sites in a particular sequence context are targeted by piggybac, as opposed to arbitrary ttaa sites,  there is no direct correlation between piggybac hotspots  and the activity of genes either contained within or near the hotspots, and  at least the first  <dig> nucleotides on either side of piggybac target site seem to be important for piggybac target selection, and a subtle change in the primary sequence within this  <dig> bp interval may result in losing its potential for piggybac targeting. these insights will provide a solid knowledge basis for engineering piggybac transposase to achieve site-specific therapeutic gene targeting.

powerful genetic tools enabling the probing of functions of both coding and non-coding genome sequences are urgently needed to facilitate the progress in determining the genetic factors that contribute to our uniqueness as human beings in a post-genomic era. the fact that piggybac favorably targets intragenic chromosomal regions makes it a great tool for uncovering the functions of protein coding genes. transposable elements are often considered "junk" dna in the human genome. an increasing body of evidence, however, suggests that a fraction of these repetitive sequences are active and play import roles in epigenetic gene regulation  <cit> . the preference of tol <dig> to target genomic repeats makes it an ideal tool for revealing new functions of transposable elements residing in our genome. collectively, the non-overlapping genome-wide target profiles of piggybac and tol <dig> potentially makes them complementary research tools for studying the human genome.

genotoxicity caused by a single integration event mediated by the retrovirus-based vector has resulted in the development of t-cell leukemia in  <dig> of  <dig> patients treated for scid with one death reported  <cit> . hence, no wild type dna transposon is considered safe for gene therapy since they all introduce transgenes into a host genome in a random fashion. indeed, our genome-wide target profiling of piggybac in hek  <dig> revealed a piggybac hotspot located within the coding region of gephyrin, a scaffold protein implicated in colon cancer and adult t-cell leukemia  <cit> . most active mammalian genome manipulating enzymes, including viral integrases and dna transposase, must therefore be molecularly modified to achieve the ultimate goal in gene therapy: targeting the therapeutic gene into a predetermined genomic site where the therapeutic gene can be stably and faithfully expressed without disturbing the global gene expression profile. put into perspective, piggybac is by far the most promising vector system for gene therapy, as piggybac transposase is the only one capable of being molecularly modified without substantially losing activity .

CONCLUSIONS
the transposon-based tool box for mammalian genomic manipulations is expanding. here, we engaged in a side-by-side comparison of two highly effective mammalian active transposons, piggybac and tol <dig>  to evaluate their pros and cons for gene discovery and gene therapy. we report the identification of the shortest piggybac trds, micro-pb, which have a higher transposition efficiency in hek  <dig> than that of the previously reported piggybac minimal terminal repeat domains, mini-piggybac. our genome-wide target profiling reveals that piggybac and tol <dig> display complementary targeting preferences, making them suitable tools for uncovering the functions of protein-coding genes and transposable elements, respectively, in the human genome. our results suggest that piggybac is the most promising dna transposon for gene therapy because its transposase is likely the most amenable mammalian genetic modifier for being molecularly engineered to achieve site-specific therapeutic gene targeting. our in-depth sequence analyses of piggybac targets revealed that the sequence context near and within a considerable distance from the ttaa piggybac target site is highly important in site selection. based on this observation, it is clear that in order to advance piggybac for a clinical use in gene therapy, a safe and favorable site for piggybac targeting in the genome of the appropriate therapeutic stem cell should first be identified, followed by the engineering of piggybac transposase to achieve site-specific gene targeting.
