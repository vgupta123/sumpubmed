BACKGROUND
thymidine kinase  is an enzyme involved in dna precursor synthesis. it phosphorylates thymidine to dtmp, which is then further phosphorylated to thymidine diphosphate  and triphosphate   <cit> .

thymidine kinase  <dig>  shows an s-phase dependent expression; tk <dig> activity increases in late g <dig> phase, reaches peak values during the s phase, and then decreases in the m phase. accordingly, high levels of tk <dig> are found in proliferating and malignant cells and tissues  <cit> . human tk <dig> has been extensively studied  <cit>  and native human tk <dig> is found in two forms, a dimer form with low thymidine affinity  and a tetramer form with high thymidine affinity . atp is a positive regulator in the tetramerization of human tk <dig>  <cit> . recent structural studies of a tk1-like enzyme suggest that the binding of atp leads to reorganization of the enzyme quaternary structure  <cit> .

a form of tk <dig> is found at high levels in the sera of humans and animals with malignant tumors; therefore, serum tk <dig> activity has been used as a prognostic marker for several different tumor types, but primarily in leukemia and lymphoma  <cit> .

serum tk <dig> activity can be measured using a radioactive substrate analogue   <cit>  and this radio-enzymatic assay has been used in dogs with malignant lymphoma to predict the relapse of disease and to follow up therapy  <cit> . a non-radiometric tk <dig> activity assay  is also used. both assays provide clinically valuable information in humans and dogs with leukemia and lymphoma, particularly for monitoring therapy and predicting relapse  <cit> . the recent development of antibodies against human tk <dig> has enabled the determination of serum tk <dig> protein levels in different hematologic and solid tumors such as bladder carcinoma  <cit> , breast carcinomas  <cit> , and non-small cell lung cancer  <cit> .

a basic question in this field concerns the structure of serum tk <dig> as compared to the cytosolic and recombinant enzyme. there is only one study that describes the molecular forms of human tk <dig> in serum  <cit> . it has been shown that serum tk <dig> activity occurs in many forms with molecular weights ranging from 60 kda to 730 kda. treatment of serum with high concentrations of the reducing agent dithioerythritol  in the presence of 1 mm atp reduced the molecular weight  of the enzyme complexes from approximately 730 kda to 100–200 kda  <cit> .

in the present study, full-length canine tk <dig> was cloned, expressed in e. coli, purified, and characterized. human tk <dig> was also cloned and expressed in the same system in order to compare these two enzymes. the subunit structures of recombinant, cytosolic, and serum tk <dig> were determined by size exclusion chromatography and immunoaffinity methods.

methods
cloning and expression of full-length canine and human tk
the open reading frame of canine tk <dig> cdna is 729 bp long, encoding  <dig> amino acids . canine tk <dig> cdna was pcr-amplified using an incyte canine cdna clone as the template . the amplified pcr fragment  was cloned into the pexp-5nt/topo vector  and sequenced. full-length htk <dig> cdna was also cloned into the same vector and sequenced. the recombinant enzymes were purified by metal affinity chromatography on ni-sepharose resin as previously described  <cit> .

cell culture and preparation of cell extracts
ccrf-cem cells  were grown in dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium supplemented with 10 % newborn calf serum, 1 mm l-glutamine and pest . madin darby canine kidney  cells  were cultured in atcc-formulated eagle’s minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum.

cells  were lysed in buffer containing 10 mm tris/hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  mm nacl, 7 mm edta,  <dig> % np- <dig>  2 mm 4-2benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride  for  <dig> minutes at 4°c. the suspension was centrifuged at 16700 × g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c, and then the supernatant was stored in aliquots at −70°c after the addition of 20% glycerol.

anti- tk <dig> antibodies
two rabbit polyclonal anti-dog tk <dig> antibodies were produced, one using a 28-amino acid  synthetic peptide  as the antigen by agrisera ab , and the other one using a 16-amino acid  synthetic peptide  as the antigen  by genscript .

the 31-mer mouse monoclonal anti-human tk <dig> antibody was produced against a 31-amino acid synthetic peptide    <cit> .

sera from dogs with hematologic tumors were collected at the small animal clinic, department of clinical sciences, swedish university of agricultural sciences, uppsala, and approved by the swedish animal ethics committee. human samples were collected at the academic hospital, department of laboratory sciences, uppsala, sweden, and approved by the local ethics committee.

thymidine kinase assay
tk <dig> activity was measured by a radiochemical method using the de- <dig> filter paper technique as previously described  <cit> . -dthd  or 3 h]-3’-azt  was used as the labeled substrate. the standard reaction mixture contained 20 mm tris–hcl ph  <dig> , 2 mm dithiothreitol , 5 mm mgcl <dig>  5 mm atp, 1% bovine serum albumin, and different concentrations of labeled substrate  in a final volume of 50 μl. one nanogram of recombinant tk <dig> was used in each reaction. the enzymes were diluted from a stock solution in tris-buffered saline  and 50% glycerol to 100 μg/ml before use. the specific activity was expressed as μmol/min/mg. one unit is defined as 1 μmol of dtmp/aztmp formed per min and mg protein.

serum tk <dig> activity was measured as previously described  <cit> .

size exclusion chromatography
size exclusion chromatography was performed essentially as described  <cit>  using a superose  <dig> column  attached to a fast protein liquid chromatography  instrument . crude cell extracts and sera , diluted 1: <dig> in  <dig>  m hepes/koh ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m nh4cl, and  <dig> % nan <dig>  were injected into the column equilibrated with the same buffer, and eluted at a flow rate of  <dig>  ml/min. fractions  were collected and analyzed. the column was calibrated with standard proteins: α2-macroglobulin , β-amylase , bovine serum albumin , ovalbumin , and horse myosin .

immunoaffinity detection of tk1
cell extracts and recombinant tk fractions were precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid  before western blot.

polyclonal anti-dog tk <dig> antibody  and the mouse monoclonal anti-human tk <dig> 31-mer antibody were covalently coupled with cnbr-activated sepharose 4b as described by the manufacturer . fplc fractions  from serum samples were diluted with 200 μl tbs and incubated with anti-dog tk <dig> or anti-human tk <dig> antibody-coupled sepharose . the samples were then agitated at 4°c for  <dig> hours followed by centrifugation. the antibody-coupled sepharose was washed twice with tbs, once with tbs-t, and once again with tbs. then, 40 μl sample buffer  sds,  <dig> % bromophenol blue, and 10 mm dtt) was added to the sepharose and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. the samples were then heated at 95°c for  <dig> minutes, and the proteins were resolved by 12% sds-page and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride  membrane  by a semi-dry transfer method as described by invitrogen. the membranes were probed with a polyclonal anti-dog tk <dig> antibody  or a chicken anti-human antibody  and immune-reactive polypeptides were detected by the enhanced chemiluminescence method .

data analysis
the unpaired t-test was used to analyze the data, and a difference was regarded as significant when the p-value <  <dig> . kinetic parameters were obtained by fitting activity data using the michaelis-menten equation with the sigma plot enzyme kinetics program .

RESULTS
cloning and expression of dog and human tk1
the canine and human tk <dig> amino acid sequences share  <dig> % identity overall. the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids are identical, and the two sequences diverge mainly at the c-terminus, with only  <dig> % identity in the last  <dig> amino acid residues ; these residues are not present in the tk <dig> structures determined so far  <cit> . another difference between these two sequences is that there are  <dig> cysteine residues in the human and  <dig> in the canine sequence; these may be involved in subunit interactions and may contribute to sensitivity to oxidizing and reducing agents.

full-length canine and human tk <dig> cdnas were cloned and expressed as fusion proteins with an n-terminal 6× histidine  tag and a tev site, providing a 15-amino acid extension to the recombinant protein. expression and purification of the his-tagged proteins were carried out as previously described  <cit> . the yields of dog and human tk <dig> were ~7 mg per liter of culture. the purity of the final recombinant tk <dig> proteins was >95% based on sds-page analysis.

substrate specificity, thermal stability, and ph dependence of recombinant dog and human tk1
the substrate specificity and stability of purified recombinant canine tk <dig> was characterized. recombinant human tk <dig> was also characterized in parallel in order to compare the two enzymes. steady-state kinetic analysis was performed in the presence of an excess atp and variable concentrations of dthd or azt, and the data were fitted to the michaelis-menten equation. the km values for dthd and azt were  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively, for canine tk <dig> , and  <dig>  μm and  <dig>  μm, respectively, for human tk <dig> . canine tk <dig> had a higher turnover rate  for both dthd and azt than did human tk <dig>  the efficiency of azt phosphorylation  was 3-fold higher for canine tk <dig> than for human tk <dig> . both enzymes showed positive cooperativity with dthd and azt, with hill coefficients of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the km values for atp were 331 μm for dog tk <dig> and 234 μm for human tk <dig>  both enzymes also exhibited positive cooperativity with atp, with hill coefficients of  <dig>  for canine tk <dig> and  <dig>  for human tk <dig> . when gtp, ctp, or utp was used as the phosphate donor the activity was only about 3–10% of the activity seen with atp for both enzymes . thymidine triphosphate  acted as an efficient feedback inhibitor, with a relative ic <dig> value of 16 μm for canine tk <dig> and 23 μm for human tk <dig> when assayed with 1 μm dthd and 1 mm atp .

results are mean ± standard error of triplicate measurements. data for human tk <dig> with atp are from one typical experiment. * n hill coefficient.

the thermal stability of the two enzymes was determined at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 50°c, and the optimum temperatures ranged from 37–45°c . the activity at 50°c was ~16% lower than that measured at 37°c for canine tk <dig>  and ~40% lower for human tk <dig> . the effects of ph were evaluated using different buffers , and there were no significant differences in the activities of canine and human recombinant tk <dig> at these ph values at either  <dig> or 45°c .

the effect of a reducing agent  on the activities of both canine and human tk <dig> was also investigated; pre-incubation of the recombinant enzymes  with dte at  <dig>   <dig>  or 20 mm on ice for 30 min in the absence or presence of 1 mm atp had no significant effect on the activities of both enzymes . however, when the enzymes were incubated with 100 mm dte , the activity of both enzymes decreased significantly , suggesting that extremely high concentrations of the reducing agent  may cause unfolding and loss of activity.

size distribution and the effect of reducing agent on recombinant tk1
to study the subunit composition of active tk <dig>  recombinant canine and human tk <dig> were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography using a superose  <dig> column in the absence of reducing agent in the buffer, in order to mimic the situation in blood, and to study the effects of reducing agent on subunit interactions. four micrograms of freshly isolated recombinant tk <dig> were injected into the column and eluted. a total of  <dig> fractions were collected and assayed for tk <dig> activity, and the level of tk <dig> protein in each fraction was determined by western blot using a rabbit polyclonal antibody against canine tk <dig> or a mouse monoclonal antibody against human tk <dig>  <cit> . the recovery of recombinant canine tk <dig> was very low with activities ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  pmol/min/ml in the collected fractions , and no protein bands could be detected in any of the fractions by western blot analysis. however, when the same amount of recombinant canine tk <dig> was pre-incubated with 20 mm dte for 30 min on ice, about 85% of the total activity was recovered in the fractions corresponding to the high mw range 300–720 kda . the canine tk <dig> protein in these fractions, detected by western blot analysis, correlated with the activity profile . currently, it is not clear why the recovery of the recombinant canine tk <dig> in the absence of dte was so low, but one possible explanation is that a large fraction of the enzyme precipitated during chromatography. nonetheless, reducing agents are apparently required for maintaining the activity of recombinant canine tk <dig> 

for recombinant human tk <dig>  about 60% of the activity was recovered in the mw range of 300–720 kda, and about 40% in the range of 200–50 kda . western blot analysis showed bands at 25 kda in the fractions with tk <dig> activity . bands at 50 kda were also detected in these fractions . pre-treatment with dte led to a shift towards lower mw, with 56% of the tk <dig> activity eluting at 50–200 kda range, whereas 47% eluted as high mw form of 300–720 kda . the protein levels, detected by western blot, correlated with the activity in these fractions . thus, the presence of dte reduced the amount of the high mw forms of recombinant tk <dig>  and increased the dimer and tetramer forms, suggesting that disulfide bonds are involved. these results demonstrate a significant difference between canine and human recombinant tk <dig> regarding their sensitivity to reducing agents.

cellular tk <dig> is active mainly as dimer and tetramer
crude mdck cell extracts were subjected to size-exclusion chromatography and the native canine tk <dig> eluted as a broad peak with mws of 40– <dig> kda. there was also some activity in the fractions at the higher mw range . western blot analysis showed a canine tk <dig> band  predominantly in fractions corresponding to mw of 40– <dig> kda .treatment of the mdck extracts with dte prior to chromatography led to a significant decrease in tk <dig> activities in the corresponding fractions . no tk <dig> bands were detected when extracts were pretreated with dte .

crude cem cell extracts were also analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography, and human tk <dig> activity was detected in fractions with mws ranging from 40–720 kda with a minor peak at 500–720 kda and a major peak at 40–100 kda . western blotting analysis showed a clear human tk <dig> band  in fractions corresponding to mws of 40–100 kda and 500–720 kda . when the same crude cem extracts were incubated with dte prior to chromatography, the level of tk <dig> activity eluted at high mw was reduced, and there was no change in the elution profiles . human tk <dig>  protein was detected only in fractions corresponding to the major peak  . thus, cellular  canine and human tk <dig> activity and protein are closely correlated, and both enzymes are present mainly as dimers and tetramers. pretreatment with reducing agents inhibited canine tk <dig> activity but had little effect on human tk <dig> activity. these results are similar to previous reports  <cit> .

oligomeric structures of serum tk <dig> and the effect of reducing agent
sera from dogs with hematologic malignancies were applied to the superose  <dig> column. tk <dig> activity and protein levels in the collected fractions were determined by a radiochemical assay and the immunoaffinity method. about 90% of total tk <dig> activity was recovered in fractions 1– <dig>  corresponding to a mw range of 300–720 kda. a polypeptide with an apparent mw of 26 kda was detected in fractions 1– <dig> and the intensity of the bands did not correlate with activity levels in these fractions . when the same sera were treated with dte  prior to chromatography, a reduction in tk <dig> activity was observed , and the canine tk <dig> protein was detected in fractions corresponding to high mw but also in fractions corresponding to 25–66 kda .

a serum sample from dogs with lymphoma with low tk <dig> activity  was also analyzed. only one activity peak was observed at the high mw and no tk <dig> protein could be detected in the western blot analysis .

sera from human patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia were pooled and analyzed. approximately 90% of the total tk <dig> activity eluted in fractions 1– <dig>  corresponding to the mw range 300–720 kda . a polypeptide with an apparent mw of 25 kda was detected in all fractions, and appeared as two peaks, one in fractions 1– <dig> and the other in fractions 9– <dig> . when the same sample was pre-treated with dte, tk <dig> activity was reduced in the corresponding fractions and the major activity peak shifted to the mw range 50–200 kda . no tk <dig> protein bands could be detected .

a serum sample from human patients with relatively low tk <dig> activity  was also analyzed. only one activity peak was detected in the high mw fractions and no tk <dig> protein could be detected in any of the fractions .

these results indicated that both dog and human serum tk <dig> are present in multimeric forms, as dimers, tetramers, and higher oligomers, and that the activities of both canine and human serum tk <dig> do not correlate with the level of tk <dig> protein in the serum. the serum enzyme is apparently more active in the multimeric complex form. furthermore, treatment with high concentrations of dte reduces the size of the complex but also leads to reduced activity, indicating that serum tk <dig> is different from recombinant tk <dig> 

discussion
recently serum tk <dig> activity has been used as biomarker for the diagnosis and prognosis of canine malignant lymphoma and leukemia  <cit> . however, the canine tk <dig> enzyme has not been characterized. therefore, the full-length canine tk <dig> cdna was cloned and expressed in e. coli. recombinant canine tk <dig> was purified and characterized, and compared with human tk <dig>  which was cloned and purified using the same procedures.

the kinetic properties of canine and human tk <dig> with their natural substrate thd, atp, and the anti-hiv nucleoside analog  were investigated. a reason for testing azt is that it is used in the commercial tk <dig> liaison assay. canine tk <dig> had higher vmax values for all tested substrates than did human tk <dig>  therefore, the overall efficiency of canine tk <dig> was higher than that of human tk <dig>  the high stability and efficiency of canine tk <dig> when using azt as a substrate explains why the tk liaison assay is suitable for canine lymphoma and leukemia studies  <cit> .

the main focus of this study was to compare the quaternary structures of serum tk <dig> with those of cellular and recombinant enzymes, and to investigate the effect of reducing agents on the respective subunit compositions. earlier studies have shown that native and recombinant human tk <dig> occur as tetramers in the presence of atp or at high concentrations, and as dimers in the absence of atp or at low enzyme concentrations  <cit> . using similar techniques, we observed that recombinant human tk <dig> is mainly present in high mw complexes in addition to dimers and tetramers, and that pretreatment with dte increased the extent of dimer and tetramer forms. recombinant canine tk <dig>  on the other hand, appeared to require reducing agents for proper folding, since in the absence of dte only a minor fraction of the analyzed protein was recovered in high mw fractions, whereas in samples pre-treated with dte, about 85% of the activity was recovered in the high mw form. both canine and human serum tk <dig> eluted mainly as high mw complexes, and the dimer and tetramer forms had very low activity. pretreatment with dte resulted in >3-fold lower activity. in the case of human serum tk <dig>  pretreatment with dte also increased the proportion of active dimer and tetramer forms. we found that serum tk <dig> activity is associated with the tk <dig> oligomer, and there was no apparent correlation between serum tk <dig> activity and protein levels.

however, cytosolic tk <dig> from cultured canine and human cells was found mainly in dimer and tetramer forms, similar to previous reports  <cit> . these results indicate that the discrepancy regarding recombinant tk <dig> quaternary structures in our study compared with previous reports is not due to technical reasons but may be due to the conditions used.

human tk <dig> contains  <dig> cysteines and canine tk <dig> contains  <dig> cysteines, four of which coordinate with zn, which leaves  <dig> and  <dig> cysteines, respectively, as free thiol groups. the structures of tk1-like enzymes, from human, bacterial, and viral origins, are all in tetrameric forms and there are no intramolecular disulfide bonds observed, since the enzymes were crystalized in reducing conditions   <cit> . in solution, in the absence of reducing agent, it is possible that surface cysteines form s-s bridges between the monomers, thereby forming oligomers. however, the oxidation of other residues like tyrosine or methionine, which lead to the formation of high molecular weight aggregates, is also possible. if oligomers were formed entirely through disulfide bonds, they should be completely reduced to dimer or tetramer in the presence of high concentrations of reducing agent. the fact that both serum and recombinant tk <dig> are persistently present as oligomeric forms irrespective of the presence of reducing agents suggested that other mechanisms are involved. in the case of human tk <dig>  disulfide bonds are most likely involved, since pre-incubation with dte increased the extent of dimer and tetramer formation. furthermore, recombinant dog tk <dig> activity increased upon pre-incubation with dte, but there was no reduction in the oligomeric form, suggesting that the reduction of oxidized residues, not necessarily cysteines, helped the enzyme to fold into the active form.

in the case of serum tk <dig>  pre-incubation of the serum samples with dte resulted in lower overall recovery of tk <dig> activity, suggesting that serum tk <dig> may be covalently associated through disulfide bonds with other stimulating or stabilizing factors. however, elucidation of the exact mechanism requires further study.

CONCLUSIONS
serum tk <dig> is present in sub-picomolar concentrations in the blood of healthy individuals and is greatly increased in patients with malignant diseases. therefore, sensitive laboratory methods are needed to obtain the specificity and sensitivity required to measure this protein. the complexity of the tk <dig> protein in serum is most likely a major contributing factor to the difficulty in developing effective determination methods. we found here that serum tk <dig> exists in a mixture of different molecular sizes, that only a fraction of the tk <dig> protein in serum is associated with tk <dig> activity, and that reducing agents have negative effects on serum tk <dig> activity. these results may help in the development of tk <dig> as a biomarker, both in human and veterinary medicine.
