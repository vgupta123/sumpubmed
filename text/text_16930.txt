BACKGROUND
cholesterol oxidase  is an alcohol dehydrogenase/oxidase flavoprotein that catalyzes the dehydrogenation of c-oh of a cholestane system to yield the corresponding carbonyl product. during the reductive half-reaction, the oxidized fad cofactor accepts a hydride from the substrate and in the ensuing oxidative half-reaction, the reduced flavin transfers the redox equivalents to molecular oxygen yielding hydrogen peroxide. interestingly, co also catalyzes the isomerization of cholest-5-en-3-one  to cholest-4-en-3-one.

co is an useful biotechnological tool employed: i) for the determination of serum  cholesterol levels, ii) as biocatalyst providing valuable intermediates for industrial steroid drug production, iii) as larvicidal protein  that has being developed as an insecticide against coeloptera. furthermore, co has been proposed as a virulence factor playing a role in infections caused by the pathogen bacterium rhodococcus equi. since this enzymatic activity is unique to bacteria, it may represent a novel molecular target for antibiotic discovery. co also acts as signaling protein for the biosynthesis of polyene macrolide pimaricin in streptomyces natalensis. for a review see  <cit> .

co is produced, and frequently secreted, by a variety of prokaryotic microorganisms. co from brevibacterium sterolicum  is produced as a  <dig> amino acid long precursor  that lacks the n-terminal pre-sequence  to yield the mature and fully active enzyme form . bco is the prototype of type ii cos: it contains a fad cofactor covalently bound to his <dig> and belongs to the family of vanillyl-alcohol oxidase, whose members possess a fold proposed to favour covalent flavinylation  <cit> . the members of co class type i  contain the fad cofactor tightly but non-covalently bound to the protein moiety. enzymes belonging to these two classes show no significant sequence identity, possess different tertiary structure, and have different kinetics mechanism and redox potentials  <cit> . in recent years, we elucidated the function of covalent flavin leakage studying the h69a bco mutant, in which the amino acid substitution prevents formation of the histidyl-fad bond. the mutant bco shows a similar structure compared to the wild-type enzyme and retains catalytic activity  but with a 35-fold decrease in turnover number, a  <dig> mv more negative midpoint reduction potential, and a significant lower stability to denaturant agents and temperature than the covalent counterpart  <cit> . we thus concluded that this covalent bond represents a structural device to both modify the reduction potentials  of the cofactor and to stabilize the tertiary structure.

bco shows peculiar characteristics that makes it a suitable biotechnological tool, such as a higher apparent kcat value on cholesterol as compared to non-covalent co  and a 5-fold lower km,o <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, the stable cofactor interaction makes bco a better choice than non-covalent cos for those applications where fad dissociation reduces the biocatalyst performances   <cit> . in fact, the apoprotein of s. hygroscopicus co  is highly unstable  <cit> .

despite its biotechnological importance, no detailed analysis has been so far reported concerning the over-production of type ii-co members  as recombinant proteins. previous results revealed that recombinant wild-type bco  were produced as a mixture of two enzyme forms containing covalently  and non-covalently bound fad, as judged by spectral and kinetics analysis  <cit> . this is the first report of bco over-expressed in e. coli using different constructs and media, and under cultivation/induction controlled conditions at flask and fermentor scale. the aim of this work is to verify the effect of these factors on the overall bco production as well as on its partitioning between the form containing covalently-bound fad  and its non-covalent  counterpart. the promising results hereby reported, will favour the use of this recombinant strain for future co biotechnological production.

RESULTS
expression of different bco forms
synthetic cdnas encoding full length and mature bco forms  were subcloned into pet24b plasmid giving a  <dig> amino acid long protein  or a  <dig> amino acid long bco , respectively, both containing a c-terminal his tag . the mbco form also contains an additional 9-residues long n-terminal sequence, previously demonstrated to be necessary for successful protein crystallization  <cit> . in preliminary experiments both the constructs were used to express bco in e. coli bl21plyss cells grown in lb medium, by inducing the protein expression with  <dig> mm iptg at different times of growth and collecting the cells   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> hours after induction. as summarized in table  <dig>  the mbco form shows the highest expression of bco activity. in the cases of fbco, the best expression conditions  are obtained when iptg is added during exponential growth phase and cells are collected after a prolonged  incubation at 25°c. in the same conditions, a volumetric productivity of nearly  <dig> u/l culture of mbco with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein is obtained. when induction is performed in the stationary phase at 25°c slightly lower expression levels of mbco  is achievable after three hours, indicating that a more rapid expression kinetics occurs in these conditions.

in all cases, e. coli cells carrying the recombinant pet24b-bco plasmids were cultivated in lb medium and protein expression was induced by  <dig> mm iptg addition. b.d., below detection limit. data are expressed as mean ± s.d., n =  <dig> 

sds-page analysis of soluble and insoluble fractions  after lyses of cells induced with  <dig> mm iptg at an od <dig> nm~ <dig>  clearly indicates that at the post-induction temperature of 37°c a large amount of the fbco as well as mbco protein is produced in the insoluble fraction . when cells are incubated at 25°c after the induction, a significant amount of recombinant fbco is found in the insoluble fraction, whereas mbco is expressed to a large extent in the soluble form. based on these results, the subsequent investigations were focused on the mbco form.

optimization of the mbco production conditions
the expression of recombinant mbco was then investigated using a modified  <dig> -kb-shorter version of pet24Δ plasmid as expression vector , that was previously reported to increase protein expression yield  <cit> . in fact, the expression level in lb broth under experimental conditions similar to those reported above  is about twice than that observed with the longer plasmid:  <dig> u/l with a specific activity of  <dig>  u/mg protein are thus achieved .

e. coli cells carrying the recombinant pet24Δ-mbco plasmid were grown at 37°c until od <dig> nm~ <dig> - <dig>  added of iptg, incubated at 25°c and harvested after  <dig> or  <dig> hour from the protein induction. data are expressed as mean ± s.d., n =  <dig> 

in order to optimize mbco expression, several experimental parameters were modified at flask-scale: cultivation medium composition, iptg concentration, growth phase at induction, and incubation temperature after induction. the medium composition significantly affects mbco expression. very low mbco expression is observed in m <dig> minimal medium . as expected, richer media support higher biomass production: more than  <dig> g cells/l are produced in tb, in tb/glucose  and sb media following overnight growth after induction, in comparison to the 6- <dig> g/l cells sustained by lb medium . the medium composition also appreciably affects the mbco's volumetric productivity and specific activity in the crude extract: these figures are significantly higher in richer media with respect to lb. the presence of glycerol as carbon source  seems to play a positive effect on mbco production , whereas when it is replaced by glucose  the volumetric yield is halved . sb medium sustains a more rapid production of biomass  in comparison to tb, but this is not accompanied by an increase in mbco productivity, which did not exceed the  <dig> u/l culture and the  <dig>  u/mg protein. in all the tested media, mbco production is higher when the cells are collected  <dig> hours after induction. the concentration of iptg does not appear to exert a significant effect either on cell growth or on protein expression: similar values of biomass and mbco expression are obtained at ≥  <dig>  mm inducer concentration . this is a valuable result since iptg represents the most expensive component used in e. coli recombinant protein production.

in richer media, such as tb and sb, induction of mbco expression during mid-exponential phase  results in higher production than at early exponential phase : more than  <dig> vs.  <dig> u/l culture with a specific activity of  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  u/mg protein are produced in tb following iptg addition at and od <dig> nm~ <dig> and ~ <dig>  respectively, in comparison to  <dig> vs.  <dig> u/l culture and  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  u/mg protein in sb medium. reduced expression of mbco is indeed observed following addition of iptg to cells grown in tb from the late exponential phase  till the advanced stationary phase  and collected after  <dig> hours .

concerning the impact of medium components, glycerol appears to play a major role on mbco expression, whereas phosphate buffer seems to exert a minor effect. addition of glycerol to sb medium increases both the specific and the volumetric productivity, whereas addition of phosphate salts does not . a similar result is observed in tb medium: removal of phosphate salts does not negatively influence the biomass production or the mbco expression, whereas in the absence of glycerol both these parameters are significantly reduced . interestingly, glycerol addition to lb medium does not change the volumetric productivity . indeed, increasing the amount of glycerol in tb medium up to  <dig> ml/l generates an improvement in the volumetric productivity as well as in the specific activity of mbco, but it does not seem to significantly affect cell growth . at  <dig> ml/l of glycerol, about  <dig> u/l culture and  <dig>  u/mg protein are produced. the temperature of incubation after iptg addition is confirmed as a crucial factor affecting mbco expression: in the four different tested media, the highest enzyme production is observed at 25°c and at 18°c, while incubation at 37°c results in a dramatic activity decrease  and at 42°c cell lysis is observed. under all conditions tested, no mbco activity is detected in the cultivation medium.

e. coli cells carrying the recombinant pet24Δ-mbco plasmid were grown at 37°c, bco expression was induced by  <dig> mm iptg at od <dig> nm =  <dig> - <dig> and harvested after  <dig> hours at different temperatures. g: glycerol. +g, +pi: media added of glycerol  and/or phosphate salts , respectively; +4g and +20g: media added of  <dig> ml/l and  <dig> ml/l glycerol, respectively; -g, -pi: media deprived of glycerol and/or phosphate salts, respectively. data are expressed as mean ± s.d., n =  <dig> 

fermentor scaling up
the best conditions set up at flask level were scaled up at  <dig> l fermentor scale. cell were grown at 37°c in tb medium added with  <dig> ml/l glycerol and iptg-induced during early-exponential phase . at the time of induction, temperature was shifted to 21°c, and the kinetics of bco production in this condition was followed for additional  <dig> hours . after a short lag phase of one-two hours, the culture starts to grow exponentially:  <dig> g cells/l are produced in 18- <dig> hours after the inoculum. more than  <dig> u/l culture and  <dig> u/mg bco are accumulated by cells entering into stationary phase . after  <dig> hours, protein production starts to slowly decrease: comparison by means of western blot and activity assays  of the amount of expressed bco indicates that the observed decrease is mainly due to protein degradation . indeed, the amount of bco activity recovered from fermentation broth is <2% of the intracellular enzymatic activity, confirming that the protein is not released from the cells.

production of covalent vs. non-covalent mbco
all the above results are based on the measurement of the enzymatic activity in the crude soluble extracts and thus account only for the soluble and catalytically active  mbco. western-blot analysis of both soluble and insoluble fractions obtained after cells disruption indicate that a significant amount of mbco is also present in the insoluble fraction . anyway, these analyses do not clarify if the expressed protein is produced or not as covalent flavoprotein. hence, the relative abundance of the flavinylated vs. the non-covalent mbco form was assessed by the spectral analysis of purified enzyme preparations  and by activity assay   <cit> . in order to assess the effect of the cultivation/expression conditions on the flavinylated vs. non-covalent mbco ratio, we compared the total expression level, as estimated on the basis of western-blot analysis, with the amount of the covalent form, as determined analyzing flavin fluorescence of sds-page unstained gels . under all the tested expression conditions , recombinant mbco is present in both the soluble and insoluble fraction, but no flavin fluorescence is observed in the lanes corresponding to the insoluble fractions. these results indicate that when the expressed mbco accomplishes the folding and the flavinylation process, it becomes a soluble protein, while the non-covalent mbco remains  present as insoluble protein.

with the aim of understanding the effect of the growth conditions on the flavinylated vs. non-covalent mbco ratio in the soluble protein fraction, the expressed enzyme was purified from the crude extracts by ni2+-affinity chromatography. the highest amount of total soluble mbco is obtained using tb  at 18°c , with a significant increase  compared to standard conditions . the percentage of covalent mbco in respect to the total amount of the produced soluble protein  is also higher under these experimental conditions, but it never exceeds the 55% of the soluble mbco .

discussion
many proteins in nature necessitate the binding of specific cofactors to perform their biological function. these molecules often fold in vivo in cellular environments where their cognate cofactors are available, and thus may bind to the appropriate polypeptide before folding. it is generally assumed that cofactors serve as nucleation sites that drive or facilitate the overall folding process since that the search of an unfolded polypeptide for the native state is made easier due to the cofactor's coordination. a number of investigations suggest a post-translational rather than a co-translational process of flavinylation  <cit> . in this study we investigated the over-expression of a type ii-co from the high g-c gram-positive brevibacterium sterolicum, which is a flavoprotein containing covalently-bound fad, in the gram-negative e. coli as heterologous host. published results  <cit>  only focused on non-covalent  cos expressed in recombinant form either in e. coli or streptomyces spp. . most of them are produced in nature by high g-c gram-positives such as streptomyces, rhodococcus and brevibacterium spp., except those originating from burkholderia and chromobacterium spp. it cannot be excluded that recombinant production of the covalent bco in e. coli may be limited since the folding procedure proceeds in a cellular environment different from that of the natural producer. nevertheless, optimization of plasmid construct , medium composition , growth temperature after induction  and harvest time , allowed to increase the amount of mbco activity expressed in e. coli from ~ <dig> up to more that  <dig> u/l culture at  <dig> l fermentor scale and from  <dig>  up to more than  <dig>  u/mg protein in the crude extract. this expression level compared favourably with previous trials  of non-covalent  cos. only the expression of rhodococcus equi co in streptomyces lividans yielded a slightly higher volumetric productivity, although its production time was 5-fold longer  <cit> . similarly, longer times were required to obtain a higher specific activity in the crude extract for streptomyces spp.  co in e. coli jm <dig>  <cit>  .

we also demonstrated that when mbco is over-expressed in e. coli, the flavinylated enzyme form is fully soluble, whereas the non-covalently fad bound mbco largely accumulates in insoluble inclusion bodies. the soluble fraction is indeed a mixture of covalent  and non-covalent mbco forms: under optimal expression conditions, nearly 55% of the soluble recombinant mbco is produced as covalently fad bound form. from the soluble fraction, a >95% homogeneous preparation of flavinylated mbco can be easily recovered due to the higher thermostability of the covalent form  <cit> : for example,  <dig> min of incubation at 45°c in the presence of  <dig>  mm cholesterol yields a complete denaturation of the non-covalent form, while the flavinylated mbco is fully stable. interestingly, the percentage of covalent mbco in the soluble crude extract is lower using conditions at which the overall mbco production is reduced , indicating that its production may be not limited by saturation of protein folding machinery or by coenzyme depletion.

CONCLUSIONS
fully active type ii mbco has been produced in e. coli at expression levels comparable with the best ones previously achieved for the biotechnological production of non-covalent  cos . under these conditions, inclusion bodies contain the insoluble non-covalently bound mbco, whereas the soluble fraction is a mixture of both the covalently and the non-covalently bound fad mbco forms. from the soluble fraction, the flavinylated enzyme can be easily recovered due to its higher thermostability in comparison to the non-covalently bound fad mbco form. taking all together these results, we conclude that the optimization of mbco over-expression in e. coli allows to produce huge amounts of the  co containing covalently bound fad as a novel biotool to be preferentially used in those biotechnological applications  where fad dissociation from type i cholesterol oxidases may reduce the biocatalyst efficiency.
