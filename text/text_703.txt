BACKGROUND
micrornas  are small non-coding rnas approximately  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides  in length that function in gene regulation at the post-transcriptional level  <cit> . they are transcribed from one dna strand as long precursors, which under the processing of various enzymes lead to mature double strand mirnas  <cit> . one strand of the mirna is degraded; the other is incorporated in a ribonucleoprotein complex, the rna-induced silencing complex , which is involved in rna interference . the mature mirna guides the action of risc to degrade mrnas of its targets.

research in recent years demonstrated that mirnas play a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of genes controlling various cellular and developmental processes  <cit> . indeed, most mirna targets identified to date are involved in the development of plant organs such as root, leaf, and flower  <cit> . however, a significant fraction of mirna target genes seems to be involved in cellular defense against abiotic stresses such as nutrient deprivation, drought, heat, and uv exposure  <cit>  or biotic stresses including attack by fungi such as phakopsora pachyrhizi and cronartium quercuum <cit>  , or bacteria such as pseudomonas syringae <cit> .

cold temperature exposure is a major abiotic stress that affects plant development and growth and significantly impacts crop production. plants evolved various processes to cope with cold stress at the cellular and developmental levels. flower and vegetative winter bud dormancy responses enable plants to avoid flower and leaf damage caused by fluctuating temperatures during winter and to synchronize the re-initiation of growth with the annual return of optimal temperatures in the spring. genetics analyses of the cold response linked with studies on vernalization suggest that srnas play a significant role in these phenological traits. for instance, expression analysis in arabidopsis thalianapopulus trichocarpabrachypodium distachyon and other plant species  <cit>  identified several mirnas with altered expression under cold stress. another study showed that arabidopsis mir <dig> positively regulates seed germination under dehydration or cold stress conditions  <cit>  by repressing demeter-like protein <dig> , which is involved in dna demethylation  <cit> . other studies  <cit>  showed that the repression of the flowering locusc  by vernalization was mediated by a 24-nt sirna.

peach belongs to prunoideae, one of the four subfamilies of the rosaceae <cit> . due to the compact genome size  and the extensive genomics and genetics resources available for this species , the peach has been highlighted as a genome model for fruiting trees in the rosaceae. in addition, as a temperate perennial tree species with a reasonably short juvenility period  and a reasonably diverse breeding germplasm, it represents an excellent model for the genetic dissection of traits important to both basic and applied tree research. as a stone fruit, peach holds a key phylogenetic position in the rosaceae, which is comprised of over  <dig> genera and  <dig>  species  <cit> . the rosaceae family ranks third in economic importance of the plant families in temperate regions  <cit> ; it includes many species such as almond, apple, apricot, blackberry, cherry, peach, raspberry, rose and strawberry, valued for nuts, fruits and flowers. recently the genome of the peach was completely sequenced and the assembly and gene annotation made publicly available on the genome database for rosaceae <cit> . however, no study reporting mirnas from peach is yet published. identifying mirnas from peach is very important to infer ancestral relationships from divergent pools of mirnas in other closely related rosaceae species  <cit>  and other more distantly related angiosperms. moreover, the identification of mirnas from peach whose expression is correlated with changing environmental cues provides a tool for uncovering the network of regulated gene activities associated with phenological responses in trees. identifying mirnas from this species enables analyses of the function of these mirnas in rosaceae species and the evaluation of the level of conservation of the mirna-mediated gene regulatory networks in this botanical family.

in this work, srnas from young emerging leaves and chilled vegetative buds were sequenced using the solid platform  and the srna transcriptome was analyzed. srna analysis in combination with mirna mining in the whole genome sequences of peach identified  <dig> and  <dig> unique conserved and non-conserved mirna sequences, respectively. in silico expression analyses enabled the identification of several mirnas displaying differential expression in winter dormant buds versus pre-dormant leaves. the prediction of mirna targets showed that these mirnas targets are involved in various biological processes. several mirnas or mirna-regulated genes were found co-localizing with previously reported qtls for chilling requirement  and bloom date   <cit> . several of these genes appear to be involved in response to cold stress. comparative and phylogenetic analysis of mirna distribution in peach and other species provide insight into the evolution of mirna families.

RESULTS
analysis of srnas from leaves and dormant buds
a total of  <dig> million sequences were generated from leaves and bud samples using the abi solid sequencing platform. the number of srna reads identified at each step of the mirna prediction pipeline is summarized in table  <dig>  among these sequences,  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> were from leaves and buds, respectively, with sizes ranging from  <dig> and  <dig> nt; with two majors peaks at  <dig> and  <dig> nt . among the,  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from leaves and buds, respectively, were contaminant rrnas, trnas, and snornas. we removed  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from leaves and buds, respectively, that had more than ten matches to the peach genome, as these likely correspond to srnas from repeated sequences. querying the remaining sequences against mirbase   <cit>  identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  read matches from leaves and buds, respectively. the remaining  <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> , <dig>  sequences from leaves and buds, respectively, corresponded to other srnas including non-conserved mirnas. after removing length variants, final sets of  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads corresponding to non-conserved mirnas from leaves and buds, respectively, were identified.

identification of conserved mirnas
 <dig>  and  <dig>  reads from buds and leaves have at least one match with less than two substitutions to conserved mirnas from mirbase. larger read numbers  were identified when srna sequences were mapped to the genome using bowtie  <cit> . however, the numbers of unique sequences obtained using bowtie or direct translation of color space to nt format using a home made script were similar. precursors of these mirnas were retrieved from the peach genome sequence, folded and checked for mirna features. mirnas were annotated using criteria described by meyers and collaborators  <cit> . we first checked the biogenesis criterion, i.e. precise excision from the stem of a stem-loop precursor. in the absence of expression for individual mirna* sequences, evidence of expression in both bud and leaf libraries or a strong accumulation in one of the libraries was used as evidence for the validity of the mirna*. in the absence of expression of the mirna and the mirna*, other criteria such as conservation of both mirna sequences and stem-loop secondary structure with other well characterized mirnas in other species, and the existence of well annotated member of the same mirna family in peach were used to validate the mirna. these analyses led to the identification of  <dig> unique sequences that belong to  <dig> conserved mirna families . mirna* sequences were identified for  <dig>  of the  <dig> identified mirna sequences . of the  <dig> mirnas with no sequenced mirna*,  <dig> were members of the peach mirna families of which at least one member was confirmed to produce mirnas by the biogenesis criteria. the remaining  <dig> were annotated as mirnas based on fold back and other ancillary criteria. ten and nine of these mirnas were present in the sequences from leave and bud libraries, respectively, or showed a strong accumulation in one of the libraries. six were annotated based on the conservation of their stem-loop secondary structure and the mature mirna sequence with previously characterized mirna sequences. of the  <dig> sequences,  <dig> mirnas were identified in both leaves and buds.  <dig> and  <dig> tissue specific mirnas were identified from leaves and buds, respectively. they are indicated in additional file 1: table s <dig> by a number of reads labeled “0”. comparison of family sizes showed that the number of unique sequences  varied widely between mirna families. the number of members per mirna family ranged between one and  <dig> . mirna families such as mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> have the largest number of members with the latter having  <dig> members. when searching the peach genome for homologs of mir <dig>   <dig> additional members were identified. several of them were expressed in both libraries and satisfied the folding criteria, but no mirna* sequences were evident. search of these sequences against peach repeated sequences did not show any significant hits. the large number of members identified for this family, suggested that these mirnas may originate from repeated sequences, thus, we decided to not include members for which no mirna* sequences were present. most of conserved families common to arabidopsis and peach  did not show significant size variation . furthermore, the size of mir <dig> was expanded in peach. analyzing the distribution in the genome showed that the mirnas identified in this study were distributed on all eight chromosomes of peach with more mirna genes on chromosome  <dig> . few mirnas were located on scaffold  <dig> that has not yet been assigned to a chromosome.

distribution of peach conserved mirnas in land plant species
all mirnas that are conserved in arabidopsis, rice and populus  or conserved between arabidopsis and populus  were found in the peach sequences . sixteen of these mirna families were deeply rooted in the phylogeny of land plants; they were present in either moss or lycophytes . among these mirna families, five  were reported only in tree species  batsch). a search for these mirnas in the genomes of arabidopsis and oryza using patscan assembly with up to two substitutions identified a homolog only for mir <dig> in oryza. twenty three conserved mirna families were found in peach and other plant species but have not been reported in other tree species. a search of these mirna in the populus genome enabled the identification of homologs from  <dig> families . other mirna families  were reported only in moss  or fern  and peach. a set of mirna  were found in peach and monocots but were not reported in other land plant species.

mapping the identified conserved mirnas on previously reported cr-qtls and bd-qtls  <cit>  showed that  <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families were co-localizing with cr-qtls and bd-qtls. three of these families  were predicted to target genes involved in response to cold stress.

identification of non-conserved mirnas
mircheck  <cit>  analysis of  <dig>  and  <dig>  non-conserved srna sequences from leaves and buds, respectively, enabled the identification of  <dig>  and  <dig> unique mirna sequences that satisfied the biogenesis criterion. after removing mirna candidates that have no sequenced mirna* and those that were represented by less than two reads in either leaves or buds datasets, as well as length variants,  <dig> unique non-conserved mirnas were identified . a search of these sequences that have not been previously reported in other model plants using patscan with up to two substitutions showed that  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were found in arabidopsisoryza, and populus, respectively. these non-conserved mirnas were represented by a number of reads ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> and from  <dig> to  <dig> for buds and leaves respectively. among the identified  <dig> non-conserved mirnas,  <dig> were co-localized with cr-qtls and bd-qtls and five of them regulate genes involved in development processes. six of these mirnas  target genes involved in development while two others  regulate genes involved in cold response. one mirna  of these  <dig> was also differentially highly expressed in winter buds .

expression profiling of mirnas in leaves and dormant buds
expression of conserved and non-conserved mirnas was assessed by counting the number of their corresponding reads in leaves and buds datasets. the expression varies widely between mirnas from different families or between members from the same family within the same tissues or between leaves and buds . the numbers of reads vary between one to  <dig> and one to  <dig> for buds and leaves, respectively. mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig>  and mir <dig> are the most expressed families in bud tissues. similar sets of mirnas, with the exception of mir <dig> and mir <dig>  were highly expressed in leaves. in silico expression analyses of mirnas using degseq  <cit>  identified  <dig> sequences belonging to eight conserved mirna families  induced in winter buds versus leaves . when degseq analyses were run using the number of reads corresponding to the most frequent length variant, similar mirna families were found to be highly differentially expressed in buds. on the contrary,  <dig> sequences belonging to  <dig> conserved mirna families were highly expressed in leaves . comparative in silico expression analysis of non-conserved mirnas using degseq showed that  <dig> non-conserved mirnas  were highly differentially expressed in winter buds . contrastingly,  <dig> non-conserved mirna sequences were highly expressed in leaves.

prediction of conserved and non-conserved mirna targets
a target search using the peach proteome  <cit>  enabled the prediction of targets for  <dig> out of  <dig>  conserved mirnas . at least one target was identified for each mirna family; however, several targets were identified for most mirnas. targets with top scores are presented in additional file 7: table s <dig>  the other targets identified with scores less than four are listed in additional file 8: table s <dig>  go annotation using the arabidopsis proteome  showed that  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, and  <dig>  % of the targets belong to the function categories “response to stimuli”, “cellular process” and “development processes” respectively. genes from development processes are all involved in various processes of flower bud induction and flower morphogenesis and development. a few genes such as chitinase a, and aicarft/impchase are involved in regulation of plant response to cold stress. a large fraction of the predicted mirna targets  were previously identified in other studies. however, new targets were predicted for several conserved mirna families in peach. confirmation of these predicted targets by analyzing the degradome  <cit>  or using 5’ race is necessary.

at least one target gene was predicted for  <dig> out of  <dig>  non-conserved mirnas . go annotation analysis identified several genes involved in plant development including several embryo defective proteins, late embryogenesis abundant, ppr <dig>  and dna glycosylase. a few targets encode proteins involved in cold stress response such as annexins, wd- <dig>  phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase c, and cellulose synthase. most importantly, several identified targets encode proteins involved in srna biogenesis and methylation such as a dicer homolog , ribonuclease iii, dna glycosylase demeter, histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> specific methyltransferase, and suvh4/kyp homolog.

several genes from qtl regions were found being targeted by conserved and non-conserved mirnas. one of these genes  is a key player in regulating vernalization in other plant species. it was predicted to be targeted by a non-conserved mirna .

discussion
conserved mirnas and distribution in angiosperm lineages
srna sequencing of over  <dig> million srna reads from predormant young leaves and dormant leaf buds enabled the identification of over  <dig> conserved and non-conserved mirna sequences from peach. the conserved mirna dataset include all mirnas conserved in arabidopsisoryza and populus or conserved between arabidopsis and populus suggesting that the dataset identified here is complete. among the identified conserved mirna set, five conserved mirna families  and several non-conserved mirnas were reported only in tree species  batsch). a search of these mirnas in the genomes of the herbaceous species arabidopsis and oryza confirmed that four of them were not found in the arabidopsis and oryza genomes. these results confirm that a small set of mirnas may exist only in tree species and function in biological processes specific to them. for instance, it was suggested that mir <dig> and mir <dig> may play important roles in the growth of trees such as the formation of specialized woody tissue or in the response of trees to mechanical stress  <cit> . other mirna families  were reported only in moss  or fern  and peach. a set of mirnas  was found in peach and monocots but not in other land plant species. this pattern of gain/loss of certain mirna families in various plant lineages was previously reported  <cit> . the inability to detect some mirnas in some angiosperm lineages could be due to the fact that these mirnas were not expressed in tissues used for constructing srna libraries in the non-model species studied. however, the absence of these mirnas in whole genome sequences of model species could only be explained by the fact that some mirnas, such as the ones identified only in trees, are specific to some lineages or species. it is noteworthy that the loss of some mirnas is not unidirectional as some mirnas from peach were lost either in monocots , or eudicots .

analysis of the size of mirna gene families showed that most of the conserved mirna families from peach have a similar number of members in arabidopsis but less genes than in populus. however, one mirna family  was over-represented in peach compared to both arabidopsis and populus. the increase in gene number of this family could be associated with the biological role of these mirnas in peach.

mirnas co-localizing with cr-qtls and bd-qtls
since we were interested in cr, we searched for mirnas that co-localize with cr-qtls and bd-qtls. we found  <dig> mirnas co-localizing with seven cr-qtls and bd-qtls. members of four families  target genes encoding proteins involved in dormancy such as embryo-defective or maternal effect embryo arrest  <dig> . others encode proteins involved in cold stress response such as annexin  <dig>  aicarft/impchase, atmekk <dig>  cellulose, and mapk/erk kinase. the list of targets also includes genes encoding a histone-lysine n-methyltransferase that is involved in vegetative to reproductive phase transition of meristem. like conserved mirnas, six non-conserved mirnas were located in the cr-qtl and bd-qtl regions. five of these mirnas target genes that are known to be involved in development processes and two target genes known to respond to cold stress.

mirna expression signatures associated with chilling requirement
relative expression of the conserved mirnas varied widely, based on the number of sequences observed for each mirna in our dataset. the ten most highly expressed mirnas  in buds and leaves are mirnas regulating genes involved in flower and leaf development processes such as integument development, leaf morphogenesis, meristem initiation, maintenance, and growth, bilateral symmetry determination, organ morphogenesis, plant phase transition, shoot apical meristem identity, flower and fruit development, and plant architecture. all of these mirnas are cold responsive  <cit> . unlike conserved mirnas, only one of the highest expressed non-conserved mirnas in pre-dormant leaves is known to play a role in a developmental process. expression analysis using degseq identified several mirnas highly expressed in winter buds. genes targeted by these mirnas include genes involved in apical meristem formation, pollen development, and an rna slider that may play a role in posttranscriptional silencing. several of these mirnas were previously reported as induced following cold stress  <cit> . the occurrence of stress-related cis elements such w-box in the regions of several of these mirnas may play a role in their activation  <cit> . three of these mirna genes  were also reported as responding to cold stress in several studies  <cit> . mir <dig> was suggested to fine-tune plant development under continuously fluctuating temperature conditions  <cit> . similarly, ten non-conserved mirnas were differentially expressed in dormant winter buds  of which three were located in cr-qtls and bd-qtls. however, none of these mirnas seem to regulate known genes involved in cold stress, flower or leaf development.

prediction of conserved and non-conserved mirna targets
target analysis enabled the prediction of target genes for all conserved and over half of the non-conserved mirnas. mirnas for which no target could be identified may correspond to young non-functional mirnas. a large set of genes targeted by peach mirnas encode genes involved in flower and leaf development. a small set of genes are involved in cold stress. among these genes is vrn <dig> a known regulator in vernalization  <cit> . this is in agreement with previous studies on arabidopsisbrachypodium, and populus showing that mirnas are involved in response to cold stress  <cit> . we also identified genes involved in methylation or rna biogenesis that may function in epigenetic regulation of plant response to cold stress. among these genes, a dicer homolog  involved in mirna processing  <cit> , a ribonuclease iii that is required for endogenous rdr2-dependent sirna formation  <cit> , a dna glycosylase demeter responsible for endosperm maternal-allele-specific hypomethylation at the medea  gene  <cit> , a histone  <dig> lysine  <dig> specific methyltransferase involved in the maintenance of dna methylation  <cit> , and a suvh4/kyp homolog that is involved in epigenetic control of flc expression  <cit> . this is in accordance with recent studies showing that epigenetic modifications including methylation, sirna signatures, and histone modifications play a major role in vernalization  <cit> .

furthermore, several genes from cr-qtls and bd-qtls regions that were reported as playing key roles in regulating vernalization were predicted targets by mirnas. several of these genes belong to the polycomb repressor  <dig> silencing complex that regulates the expression of the key flowering gene flc <cit> . for instance, vrn <dig> is targeted by the non-conserved mirna . these two genes function in maintaining the repression of the major target of the vernalization pathway, the floral repressor flc. however, it is currently unknown what role these two genes may play in cr regulation in perennial trees, which is a significantly different phenological character particularly since the flc gene has not yet been reported as present in the peach genome or the genomes of its close relatives .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, this study identified hundreds of conserved and non-conserved mirnas and their target genes in peach, a rosaceae model species expanding our understanding of the pattern of conservation of mirna in land plant lineages. this study also identified several cold-responsive mirnas and their predicted gene targets present in cr-qtls and bd-qtls thus, potentially connecting mirna regulatory activities to cr and dormancy in peach. this mirna dataset will be very useful to the scientific community working on rosaceae and other plant families for functional analyses of genes of interest and for deciphering the gene regulatory networks of cr and bud dormancy in peach.
