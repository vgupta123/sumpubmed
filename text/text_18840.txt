BACKGROUND
growth traits are the major interest in aquaculture. growth traits are complex traits that regulated by many loci that have quantitative effects on the phenotype. due to the ease of measurement, the economic importance and intermediate heritabilities for growth traits, phenotypic selection has been commonly and effectively applied in fish breeding programs. however, the process of developing new varieties or lines is labor intensive, time consuming and costly by using traditional breeding methods. marker-assisted selection  by using markers tightly linked to quantitative trait loci  as a substitute to assist phenotypic screening, can overcome the shortcomings in traditional breeding, thus increasing the accuracy and efficiency of selection  <cit> . this technique is especially valuable for traits with low to moderate heritability, which are difficult to be improved by traditional selection.

identification of qtl related to growth is the basis for application of genetic markers in fish breeding. a key step in qtl analysis of complex traits is the establishment of large collections of genetic markers  <cit> . a few studies are available on linkage and qtl mapping for growth traits in fish, such as salmonids  <cit> , sea bream  <cit> , rainbow trout  <cit> , tilapia  <cit> , asian and european seabass  <cit>  and turbot  <cit> . however, the identification of qtl underlying complex traits have proved to be very challenging due to gene-gene and gene-environment interactions, low proportion of explained phenotypic variation for each locus  <cit> , the large number of qtl, and many additional sources of variation  <cit> . linkage-based qtl mapping and linkage disequilibrium -based genetic association mapping are two major approaches to locate genes that control phenotypes of interest. combined linkage and association analysis showed significant improvement in detection of qtl and have shown the ability to unravel the secrets of complex traits in animal breeding  <cit> . few such reports exist for fish to date.

many traits with importance in agriculture change with time or other independent variables  <cit> . in animal, many factors such as skeletal structure, organ, muscle, and fat mass contribute to overall body size  <cit>  and family-based, age-related and strain-specific growth differences are likely to co-exist  <cit> . genetic factors affecting growth are expected to vary among individuals, families and different stages of development. the power of qtl analysis is therefore seriously limited, since only segregating qtl in one or both parents that were used in constructing mapping families can be detected  <cit> . although some family/population-specific qtl have been reported in the asian seabass  <cit>  and other fishes  <cit> , the molecular and genetic basis of growth traits remains fragmentary, highlighting the need for additional studies of these important trait in fish.

the asian seabass lates calcarifer is an important farmed marine foodfish species, widely distributed in the indo-west pacific region . currently a second generation linkage map for the asian seabass was developed with  <dig> markers  <cit> . based on the genetic map information, some qtl for growth traits were mapped  <cit> . significant qtl for growth traits measured at the age of  <dig> months were mapped onto linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  using f <dig> families. fine mapping of qtl on linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig> identified a qtl cluster underlying growth traits in the asian seabass  <cit> . these studies provided preliminary data for application of mas selection in the asian seabass. however, due to the low analytic power of f <dig> families for qtl mapping, some qtl for growth might be missed.

the potentials of mas to improve traits are increasingly evident in aquaculture. identification of qtl-related economic traits is a major aim of fish genome research. in southeast asia, the harvesting time for the aquacultured asian seabass is starting from about nine months of age. in order to map qtl for growth traits at different farming stages of the species, we conducted a whole genome scan for growth traits at the age of six and nine months post hatch by using an f <dig> family including  <dig> individuals, and genotyping with  <dig> microsatellites and  <dig> snps. we identified significant and suggestive qtl that affect growth-related traits  in the asian seabass. in addition, we detected snps in  <dig> candidate genes related to growth, nutritional condition or environmental adaptation and mapped them in the linkage map of asian seabass. the gene ifabp-a located on lg <dig> was significantly associated with growth. our study provides a basis for identification of genes controlling growth traits and conducting of mas in the asian seabass.

RESULTS
phenotypic data in the f <dig> mapping family
in the asian seabass, qtl mapping for growth traits that measured at the age of  <dig> months have been reported  <cit> . significant qtl for growth traits were mapped onto linkage groups  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in these previous studies, only f <dig> families were used in qtl mapping. due to the low power of f <dig> families for qtl mapping, some qtl might not be detected. to identify qtl that have not been identified in previous studies, we carried out a qtl analysis for growth traits that measured at the age of  <dig> and  <dig> months in an f <dig> full sib mapping family  of the asian seabass. body weight, standard length and total length data  were measured at two different stages of development. the means  for the  <dig> growth traits in the f <dig> population are provided in table  <dig>  significant phenotypic differences were observed among individuals of the family. the observed phenotypic values ranged from  <dig> g to  <dig> g  with an average of  <dig>   g for the trait bw6m, and the values ranged from  <dig> g to  <dig> g  for the trait bw9m. the phenotypic variance within a population is the result of genetic sources and/or environmental sources. under the same conditions, a larger phenotypic variance in a population suggests a higher degree of genetic variation. the population f2s <dig> showed substantial levels of phenotypic variation, therefore, had enough statistical power for qtl detection. strong positive phenotypic correlations between pairwise traits were observed. the coefficients ranged from  <dig>  between bw9m and sl6m to  <dig>  between tl9m and sl9m, underlying a common genetic basis for these traits. similar results were reported in tilapia  <cit>  and turbot  <cit> .

linkage and qtl mapping
one hundred and twenty-three microsatellite markers showed informativeness in the f <dig> mapping family. these markers distributes evenly on the  <dig> linkage groups that defined by wang et al.  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> snp markers that developed from genes related to growth, nutritional condition, or environmental adaptation were also applied in map construction. primer information for the snp markers was listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  using linkage analysis and lod ≥  <dig> as threshold for mapping data, all loci were finally assigned to  <dig> linkage groups , designated as lg <dig> – lg <dig>  corresponding to the linkage group names of the high-resolution linkage maps  <cit> . the largest linkage group lg <dig> obtained in this study containing  <dig> markers and had a length of  <dig>  cm, and the shortest linkage group lg <dig> consisted of  <dig> markers with a length of  <dig>  cm. the total length for the map was  <dig> cm with an average linkage group length of  <dig>   cm. the average spacing between adjacent markers was  <dig>   cm, therefore meeting the minimum requirements for qtl analysis  <cit> . most markers mapped in the same linear order as in the high-resolution linkage maps  <cit> . the differences between two maps could be caused from the differences in mapping population sizes and marker numbers, genotyping errors and the nature of the population, e.g., differences in family structures and female/male specific recombination rates. summary of linkage map information and the averaged linkage map are presented in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: figure s <dig>  respectively.

we analyzed six types of growth traits. genome-wide  and linkage group -wide lod threshold  were calculated from  <dig> permutations of the quantitative trait data. forty-five suggestive qtl including  <dig> significant qtl  were detected across all traits, which might be representative of the genetic architecture of growth traits in the asian seabass. two qtl intervals were detected on each of the  <dig> linkage groups . no significant association was found in  <dig> linkage groups , probably due to the low informativeness of involved markers and the nature of the genetic architectures of these traits. for each trait,  <dig>  to  <dig>  suggestive qtl were detected, suggesting that these traits are highly polygenic. one qtl confidence interval on linkage group lg <dig> for sl6m and sl9m was large, covering nearly the entire chromosomes. of the  <dig> significant qtl ,  <dig> were detected at the genome-wide significant level . qtl that surpassed the suggestive lod threshold are summarized in table  <dig> and shown in figure  <dig> 

the proportions of phenotypic variance explained  by all the suggestive qtl were generally small. the highest pve was  <dig> % for the suggestive qtl tl6m_i, which were located on lg <dig> . the pve for the eight qtl of the trait bw6m ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % ; and for the nine qtl of trait sl6m, the pve ranged from 3%  to  <dig> % . the small pves of the qtl that identified per trait suggest that the expression of these traits is under the control of a number of genes. similar results were obtained in turbot by sánchez-molano  <cit> , in which, the pve of the tightest linked markers to the significant qtl varied from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for weight and from  <dig> % to  <dig> % for body length. some potential candidate genes were detected near or on some of the qtl intervals, e.g. ig2f2bp <dig> on lg <dig>  ifabp-a on lg <dig>  2-tnnl <dig> on lg <dig>  gcdh on lg <dig>  sp on lg <dig> and apoci on lg <dig> 

significant differences in qtl positions for different growth traits were also found, such as sl6m_a on lg <dig>  sl9m_b on lg <dig> and sl9m_c on lg <dig>  suggesting that different sets of genes are involved in the control of these traits. in a previous study of the asian seabass  <cit> , five significant qtl controlling growths were detected on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  and explained  <dig>  -  <dig> % of the observed phenotypic variance, respectively. we also identified two qtl regions on these linkage groups. but, low pves and only suggestive significance level  were found for these qtl. these differences could result from the growth variations at different development stages among different families, since we measured traits of fishes at the age of  <dig> and  <dig> months, but those used by wang et al.  <cit>  were measured at the  <dig> months. specific qtl for body weight, standard length and total length that detected at different sampling time period suggest that there were dynamic expression for the traits, as in salmonids  <cit> , in which some qtl were differentially expressed at different developing stages.

co-localization of the detected qtl among traits is evident, indicating that pleiotropic effects may be playing a role in growth of the asian seabass. this result was expected since high genetic correlations among growth traits were found in the seabass and other fish species. all suggestive qtl were located in  <dig> different genomic regions of  <dig> linkage groups. qtl regions having similar lod profiles for multiple traits were detected on  <dig> linkage groups . interestingly, one qtl region on linkage group lg <dig>  was significantly associated to all traits . given that the high and sharp lod peak, one common locus might be responsible for the different traits. the pve of traits for this qtl ranged from  <dig> %  to  <dig> % . near or on this qtl, eight markers including two snp markers were located within  <dig>  cm regions . interestingly we found ifabp-a-snp <dig> marker showed a significant association to the traits. this result suggests that ifabp-a gene is of great importance in growth of fish and hence, warrant further studies.

association of heterozygosity with growth traits in the full sib mapping family
the degree of heterozygosity was used to test for direct effects of the markers on the growth traits. to compare the distribution of genotypes between pairs of extreme size classes for each trait , the degree of heterozygosity for used loci in two extreme size groups of each trait were calculated and tested by using fisher's exact test. pairwise tests revealed significant heterogeneity of genotypes among two extreme size groups in multiple markers . the degrees of heterozygosity for  <dig> loci  to  <dig> loci  were significantly different between two extreme size groups of each trait. three snp markers  showed significant heterogeneity of genotypes among size-group pairs. the heterozygosities for four of the six loci for bw6m and five of the eight loci for bw9m were highly present in the large size group . the remaining loci show high heterozygosities in the small size group. ifabp-a-snp <dig> show high heterozygosity  in the large size group  and show low heterozygosity in the small size group  for all six traits  . this result confirmed the putative association of ifabp-a-snp <dig> with growth traits that obtained in qtl analysis. the heterozygosities of marker genotypes that significantly associated with positive effects in traits suggest possible heterosis and potential utility for mas in the asian seabass. for example, selection with heterozygote would favor growth in the population. the significant associations between the degree of heterozygosity of loci and traits are presented in additional file 4: table s <dig> 

analysis of associations between candidate markers and growth traits in  <dig> populations
the large impact of markers/genes detected in the qtl model does not necessarily mean that the polymorphisms are causative mutations. ld-based association mapping represents a much greater precision than qtl mapping  <cit> . to verify the association of the markers to body weight that were identified by qtl mapping and display their applications in other families in breeding programs, six markers on or near qtl regions were selected and applied in association analysis of  <dig> populations produced by mass crosses. these markers were distributed on  <dig> linkage groups. two snp markers  were located on the same gene of linkage group lg <dig>  the other  <dig> markers located on separate linkage groups. except the microsatellite marker lca <dig>  all the remaining five markers were located on qtl intervals at genome wide significance level. for each population,  <dig> to  <dig> individuals were used. substantial phenotypic variation among populations ranging from  <dig>  g  to  <dig>  g  was observed at the age of  <dig> months . this variation can result from uncontrolled environmental factors; each population was therefore treated separately during association analysis. summary description of the association study in the four populations using selected markers is presented in table  <dig> 

analysis model and data type: a, glm model with genotype data; b, mlm model with genotype data; c, glm model with haplotype data; d, mlm model with haplotype data. significant level: *, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> ; and ***, p <  <dig> .

the ld association was tested between the homozygous/heterozygous genotypes and haplotypes of the selected markers and phenotype data . for each selected marker, an association analysis was performed. an important concordance was observed between qtl mapping and association studies. except the marker lca <dig>  the remaining five markers show significant association with body weight trait in one to two populations. five markers show significant association in population f2s <dig>  the remaining three populations were associated to one or two markers under different models. this may result from the limited population sizes, age differences, and some genotypic combinations of the two loci are unfavorable under some specific conditions. in the four populations, the observed phenotypic data for the heterozygosity genotype  for marker ifabp-a-snp <dig> were generally larger than those for cc genotypes , indicating the snp has a significant additive effect on bw3m. ifabp-a-snp <dig> haplotypes and genotypes were significantly associated to bw3m in two populations . however, to our surprise, when compared the trait data for three genotypes  in f2s <dig> and f2s <dig>  the gg genotype showed negative effect in f2s <dig>  but showed positive effect in f2s <dig>  these results indicated there were unfavorable factors that associated to g haplotype in f2s <dig> populations, which also compromised the cg heterozygosity effect in the population. our study showed that the markers located on the qtl intervals at the genome wide significance level were quite reliable for application in mas. since family/population-specific qtl exist, further studies using more markers near qtl and a larger number of families with high performances are required to identify marker-trait associations.

characterization of ifabp genes in the asian seabass
both qtl and association mapping revealed the ifabp-a snp <dig> marker was significantly associated to growth traits, which explained  <dig> - <dig> % of phenotypic variance. therefore, ifabp-a may be an important candidate gene for growth. to further validate its functions in growth, we studied the ifabp gene by cloning and characterization. in fish, ifabp gene was characterized only in few species, e.g., paralichthys olivaceus <cit>  and zebrafish  <cit> . the ifabp gene shows binding specificity for long-chain fatty acids and is proposed to be involved in uptake of dietary fatty acids and their intracellular transport  <cit> , similar to the roles in mammals. we found that ifabp gene has two isoforms, ifabp-a and ifabp-b, in the asian seabass. these two isoforms locate on lg <dig> and lg <dig>  respectively. we cloned the complete orfs and partial utrs for both genes. the two isoforms showed similar gene structures, including  <dig> exons and  <dig> introns with a deduced polypeptide sequence of  <dig> amino acids in each gene, similar to that of p. olivaceus <cit> . however, the two genes are far apart with a genetic distance of  <dig>  between the amino acid sequences of two isoforms. the phylogenetic tree analysis suggests that the two seabass ifabp protein genes belong to two distinct groups . the patterns of diversification suggest a long evolutionary history for the two isoforms. the snp mutation ifabp-a-snp <dig> showing significant association to growth was located at exon  <dig> of the gene . in the qtl mapping and association populations, two alleles  were detected at snp <dig>  this c to g transversion caused the amino acid threonine  changing to arginine  in the polypeptide sequence. this mutation might have influence on growth in fish. another snp ifabp-a-snp <dig> was mutated at the 3rd intron between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> of the gene without significant association to growth .

expressions of the two ifabp homologs in the fish intestines in response to fast challenge
qpcr revealed that both isoforms were abundantly expressed in the intestines but weakly or barely detectable in other tissues . ifabp-a was more highly expressed than ifabp-b in the control intestines . temporal expression of the two genes in the intestines showed substantial down-regulation at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> days post fast  , underlining the functional importance in nutritional digestion and absorption-related pathways of the fish. the ifabp-a gene shows significant down-regulation in samples at  <dig> days post fast , and the ifabp-b shows significant down-regulation in samples at  <dig> days post fast , suggesting different functions for these isoforms. in mammals, significant associations among fatness, the abundance of ifabp and growth  <cit>  and common variants showing an important effect on fatness and growth  <cit>  were reported. these studies suggested that the growth and fatness shared partially genetic architecture. in our study, qtl mapping and association analysis suggest that ifabp-a gene might regulate the growth in fish. although direct functional evidence relating the variant to growth was lacking, analyses of ifabp in the asian seabass by qpcr gave additional support to our qtl findings. since ifabp gene plays key roles in metabolism though the digestion and absorption of fatty acids in animals, it is reasonable to consider that ifabp-a may be a strong candidate for the important growth genes in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
a genome-wide qtl study was performed for growth traits at age of  <dig> and  <dig> months post hatch in the asian seabass. twenty-one significant qtl and  <dig> suggestive qtl were detected across all traits, which might be representative of the genetic architecture of growth traits in the asian seabass. qtl mapping and association analysis revealed that ifabp-a-snp <dig> was significantly associated to growth. characterization of ifabp gene gives additional support to our qtl findings and suggests that ifabp-a is strong candidate gene for growth in fish. our data supply a basis for fine mapping qtl, marker-assisted selection and further detailed analysis of the functions of the ifabp gene in fish growth.
