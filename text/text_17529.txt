BACKGROUND
lung surfactant is a surface active material. it reduces the surface tension of the air-liquid interface in alveoli, thus preventing alveoli from collapsing. deficiency of surfactant at the alveolar surface results in respiratory distress syndromes  in both newborns and adults  <cit> . lung surfactant is synthesized and secreted by alveolar type ii cells. it is mainly composed of phospholipids and surfactant proteins a, b and c . major components of surfactant are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and stored in specialized organelles called lamellar bodies  <cit> .

lamellar bodies are lysosome-related, large secretory organelles that are  <dig> to  <dig> micrometers in size  <cit> . similar to lysosomes, lamellar bodies contain soluble lysosomal enzymes, such as acid phosphatase and lysosome associated membrane proteins  <cit> . lamellar bodies have an acidic interior with a ph of about  <dig>  or below  <cit> . however, lamellar bodies are different from lysosomes in that they are specialized for storage and secretion of surfactant rather than for degradation processes. the principal components of lamellar bodies, phospholipids, are tightly packed as concentric arrangements of bi-layer membranes. secretion of surfactant involves the translocation, docking and fusion of lamellar bodies with the apical plasma membrane  <cit> .

the molecular mechanisms that control the exocytosis of lamellar bodies are still poorly understood  <cit> . the recent emergence of powerful proteomic techniques has made it possible to profile the protein components in a specific tissue or subcellular organelle  <cit> . to better understand the regulation of lamellar body biogenesis and exocytosis, we performed proteomic analysis of lamellar bodies isolated from rat lungs. we carried out both one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, followed by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization – time of flight mass spectrometry  and immunohistochemistry. here, we report the first proteomic profiling of lamellar bodies, which will aid in defining the mechanisms of lamellar body exocytosis.

RESULTS
the method used to isolate lamellar bodies was based on the work of chander et al.  <cit>  and is in routine use in our laboratory  <cit> . the isolated lamellar body fraction consists of intact lamellar bodies and large amounts of concentric multilamellated membrane structures and contains no other organelles except for very low amounts of microsomes.

one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  staining with colloidal coomassie brilliant blue revealed more than  <dig> protein bands. due to the complexity of protein components of lamellar bodies, we also performed two-dimensional page to get better separation of the proteins. the two-dimensional gel electophoresis revealed more than  <dig> spots. well-resolved protein bands or spots were harvested for peptide mass fingerprint analysis. figs.  <dig> and  <dig> show some of the identified proteins from representive gels.

to identify protein components in lamellar bodies, we utilized trypsinolytic fingerprinting, maldi-tof mass spectrometry and statistically scored database searching . table  <dig> lists the  <dig> proteins identified from the highly purified lamellar bodies. listed for each protein include the national center for biotechnology information  accession number, the number of peptides matched and percent of sequence covered, the mascot® probability based mowse  score and the molecular mass. by applying each of these proteomics search criteria, the proteins were identified with great confidence.

the functional classification was performed by a literature search in the pubmed database. the functional categories include calcium-binding proteins, structural proteins, surfactant-related proteins, ion channels, membrane traffic, protein processing, signal transduction and miscellaneous proteins .

based on the availability of antibodies, we selected several important proteins identified by trypsinolytic fingerprinting from each functional category and verified their identities by western blotting and immunohistochemistry. actin, annexin a <dig>  calreticulin, eh domain-containing  <dig> protein , rho-gdp dissociation inhibitor alpha  and vimentin were confirmed to be present in lung tissue and lamellar bodies as seen by western blot . lamellar bodies contain more ehd <dig> than freshly isolated type ii cell lysate. only a small portion of gdi-alpha and actin were present in lamellar bodies, indicating these proteins were also localized elsewhere in type ii cells. annexin a <dig> and calreticulin existed in lamellar bodies and freshly isolated type ii cell lysate in a similar amount. vimentin was abundantly present in lamellar bodies, however undetectable in freshly isolated type ii cells. the reason is unclear but could be due to the enrichment of this protein in lamellar bodies and the detection sensitivity. ehd <dig> along with the carbonic anhydrase iv  protein were further investigated for their cellular localization in overnight-cultured type ii cells because of their suitability for double-immunostaining. as seen in fig.  <dig>  both ehd <dig> and caiv partially colocalized with the lamellar body marker, lb- <dig>  the localization of these proteins at lamellar bodies further suggests their roles in lamellar body function.

since some of the proteins are developmentally regulated, we also determined the developmental profiles of two of the identified proteins . the protein expression levels of ehd <dig> peaked postnatally. calreticulin was expressed constantly throughout lung development.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
although proteomic analyses have been performed on several secretory granules  <cit> , proteomic prolifes of lamellar bodies of alveolar type ii cells have remained a mystery. here, we have identified  <dig> proteins present in lamellar bodies by using one- and two dimensional electrophoresis and trypsinolytic fingerprinting. the identification of these proteins provides a basis for further studying their functions in lamellar body exocytosis and biogenesis.

the proteins in lamellar bodies fell into diversified functional categories. several calcium-binding proteins were identified, including the annexin family and calreticulin. there are some controversies as to which annexins are expressed in alveolar type ii cells in literature. we previously showed that annexin a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  a <dig>  but not a <dig> and a <dig> were present in rat alveolar type ii cells as determined by immunoblotting  <cit> . however, sohma et al. were able to detect annexin a <dig> in type ii cell lysate  <cit> . mayran et al. observed the presence of annexin a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> in type ii cells by using immunohistochemistry  <cit> . the inconsistency is likely due to differences among the antibodies used in the respective experiments. using the proteomic approach, we identified seven members of the annexin family, annexin a1- <dig>  in lamellar bodies.

consistent with its representation in the lamellar body proteome, annexin a <dig> is important in various aspects of membrane trafficking  <cit> . a series of studies from our laboratory support a role of annexin a <dig> in lung surfactant secretion. it mediates the fusion between lamellar bodies and the plasma membrane  <cit> . the silencing of annexin a <dig> by rna interference inhibits regulated lung surfactant secretion  <cit> . annexin a <dig> functions in lung surfactant secretion via its interaction with snap- <dig>  <cit> . disruption of lipid rafts, a platform organizing exocytotic proteins on a membrane, reduced annexin a2-mediated fusion of lamellar bodies with the plasma membrane  <cit> . in addition to annexin a <dig>  annexin a <dig> has also been proposed to be involved in regulating lung surfactant secretion  <cit> .

we find that annexin a <dig>  a <dig> and a <dig> are the components of the lamellar body proteome. annexin a <dig> and a <dig> have been reported to play roles in endocytosis  <cit> . annexin a <dig> was reported to be secreted from type ii cells. because its secretion was stimulated by phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate  and inhibited by sp-a, showing the same pattern as that of surfactant secretion  <cit> , annexin a <dig> may be released through lamellar bodies. annexins play important roles in governing lamellar body exocytosis and endocytosis, membrane organization, membrane cytoskeleton linkage and ion conductance.

soluble n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein attachment protein receptors  are a conserved mechanism for membrane targeting, docking and fusion  <cit> . we have previously shown that the plasma membrane snares, syntaxin  <dig> and snap- <dig> and their co-factor, α-snap are essential for regulated surfactant secretion  <cit> . we have also detected the vesicle snare, vamp- <dig> in lamellar bodies of type ii cells using immunofluoresence  <cit> . however, our proteomic analysis of lamellar bodies did not show the presence of vamp- <dig>  the possible reasons include its low abundance or loss during sample preparation and separation.

we note that calreticulin is a component of the lamellar body proteome. calreticulin is a calcium-binding protein for calcium storage in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit> . it has also been reported to act as an important modulator of the regulation of gene transcription by nuclear hormone receptors  <cit> . consistent with its representation in our demonstration of the lamellar body proteome, lamellar bodies contain a high level of calcium, especially those in the apical area. it was reported that the exocytotic lamellar bodies contain significantly higher calcium compared to those in the perinuclear area  <cit> . this suggests that this high content of calcium in lamellar bodies may be a supply for the increase in local calcium concentration during fusion events. thus, our results indicate that calreticulin may be the main calcium-binding protein in lamellar bodies and may control the release of calcium ions during exocytosis.

in agreement with the nature of lamellar bodies as discrete cytological structures, we identified several cytoskeletal proteins in lamellar bodies by proteomic analysis. these proteins include β-actin, myosin- <dig>  tropomysin  <dig>  moesin, cytokeratin  <dig> and vimentin. cytoskeleton is composed of  <dig> filamentous structures: actin filaments, intermediate filaments and microtubes of myosin. it has been reported that actin  <cit>  and microtubules  <cit>  play a role in the transportation of lamellar bodies. the cortical cytoskeleton in type ii cells undergoes disassembly and assembly after being stimulated with lung surfactant secretagogues  <cit> . this process is regulated by annexin a <dig> and is essential for the lamellar body's access to the apical plasma membrane. cytokertain  <dig> and vimentin are components of the intermediate filaments  <cit> . tropomysin  <dig> is a ~ <dig> kda ubiquitous protein that is associated with the actin filaments and regulates the functions of actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . moesin is a member of the ezrin/adixin/moesin family and plays a role in the linking of the plasma membrane and cytoskeleton  <cit> . these proteins may also be involved in the movement of lamellar bodies.

among the major surfactant-related proteins described here, sp-a and sp-b are known components of lung surfactant. however, we did not detect sp-c. this is likely due to its loss during sample preparation and gel separation since sp-c is a hydrophobic and low molecular mass peptide. we also observed that several other proteins previously implicated in lamellar body biogenesis are in fact part of the lamellar body proteome. atp-binding cassette transporter a <dig>  is a unique type ii cell marker that was originally identified by a monoclonal antibody screen using lamellar body limited membrane  <cit> . it transports lipids into lamellar bodies  <cit> . abca <dig> mutations result in fatal neonatal lung diseases  <cit> . peroxiredoxin- <dig>  which possesses both phospholipase a <dig> and peroxidase activity, is responsible for the degradation of the main recycled surfactant phospholipid, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine , in type ii cells  <cit> . apolipoprotein a is the major apoprotein of high-density-lipoprotein   <cit> . the identification of apolipoproteins in lamellar bodies suggests that the cholesterol of surfactant may originate from hdl. our findings suggest that these proteins are important components of lamellar bodies, thus demanding closer examination of their roles in lamellar body structure, function and regulation.

our results support the idea that lamellar bodies are lysosome-related organelles that retain some lysosome-like features. we note that several lysosome-like proteins are the components of lamellar bodies. along with lysosome membrane protein ii  <cit> , some proteases   <cit>  and protease inhibitors   <cit>  were identified, which suggests that lamellar bodies may not only store surfactant, but they may also play a role in surfactant processing. we also identified the vacuolar proton transporting atpase  subunit . v-atpases may pump protons into lamellar bodies to maintain the low ph inside lamellar bodies  <cit> ., which is essential for surfactant processing  <cit>  and calcium uptake  <cit> .

our analyses of the lamellar bodies also implicate novel proteins that may regulate lamellar body function. one is the eh domain-containing  <dig> protein . the eh domain includes an ef-calcium-binding motif, a highly conserved atp/gtp-binding domain and a central coiled-coil structure  <cit> . it has been reported that ehd <dig> interacts with snap- <dig> and plays a role in the endocytosis of insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  receptors  <cit> . its role in the regulation of endocytic recycling has been further confirmed in other systems  <cit> . while ehd <dig> has not been previously implicated in endocytosis of surfactant, our findings imply that ehd <dig> may have a role in lamellar body function.

our indentificatoin of gdi alpha as a major component of lamellar bodies suggest that it may be involved in the docking of lamellar bodies at the plasma membrane. rab proteins are small gtp-binding proteins that play roles in vesicular trafficking of molecules between cellular organelles  <cit> . they serve as functional switches for the gtp-gdp exchange reaction. rab gdp dissociation inhibitors  can reduce the rate of gdp dissociation from rab proteins  <cit> . rab gdi alpha has been reported to bind rab3a and modulates their activity and vesicle-mediated transport  <cit> . small gtp-binding proteins are associated with lamellar bodies  <cit> . rab3d only exists in subpopulations of lamellar bodies   <cit> .

carbonic anhydrase  is a zinc metalloenzyme, which reversibly catalyses the conversion of co <dig> to hco <dig> and a proton  <cit> . they are predominantly involved in maintaining acid-base balance. caii was present in both lung type i and type ii cells  <cit> . caiv were detected in alveolar capillary endothelium but not on large blood vessels  <cit> . our results indicated that caiv was localized on the lamellar bodies of type ii cells. lamellar bodies maintain acidic interiors, which favor not only processing of sp-b and sp-c but also aggregation of surfactant lipids  <cit> . thus, the presence of caiv on lamellar bodies might be one of the additional mechanisms in maintaining and regulating the acidic interiors.

our results document the first comprehensive proteome of the isolated rat lung lamellar bodies. however, lamellar bodies likely contain proteins that were not detected in our study due to their low abundance or due to individual molecular masses and isoelectric point values that hinder analysis by gel-based techniques. there may also be more proteins that we could not identify due to the incomplete nature of the rattus sequence database. it is also noted that a few identified proteins have lower molecular masses than the calculated values. this is probably due to degradation or processing. our initial characterization of the protein constituents of lamellar bodies provides a platform for further studying lamellar body biogenesis and surfactant secretion.
