BACKGROUND
soybean cyst nematode  is an obligate, sedentary endoparasite that is consistently the most damaging pest of soybean in the u.s.  <cit> . once scn is present in a field it cannot feasibly be eradicated.

the scn life cycle consists of five stages. after the first molt within the egg, scn second stage juveniles  hatch, move through the soil, penetrate roots and move toward the vascular cylinder  <cit> . migratory juveniles select a host cell in the cortex, endodermis, or pericycle and induce host cell fusion as part of the formation of a permanent feeding site called a syncytium. at this point the nematode becomes sedentary and differentiates to the third  and fourth  juvenile stages and then matures to an adult female or male. males undergo a metamorphosis to resume a vermiform shape at the j <dig> stage and migrate back out of the root to fertilize adult females. following fertilization, the female produces eggs, most of which remain inside the body. after dying, the female body develops into a hardened cyst that encases the eggs. at 25°c, some nematodes reach the adult stage  <dig> days after entering roots, and most become adults by  <dig> days post-infection  <cit> .

soybean cyst nematodes infect and grow in the roots of both resistant and susceptible cultivars  <cit> . nematode growth and development depends on the successful establishment and maintenance of a syncytium, and impairment of the syncytium can give outcomes that range from reduced growth and reproduction to death. the available scn resistance in soybean is partial, and can be observed as a reduced number of females that develop compared to the number that develop on similarly inoculated susceptible cultivar controls  <cit> . in intact soybean plants, resistance is often expressed as the female index : the number of fully developed females  on the tested soybean genotype divided by the number of females on a susceptible standard  <cit> . soybean cultivars are generally classified as strongly resistant to scn if the fi is less than 10%; partial levels of resistance can also be useful  <cit> .

the scn resistance in current commercially grown soybeans is derived from a very small number of sources  <cit> . these sources include 'peking' , pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  which have each been shown to carry resistance loci effective against multiple nematode races  <cit> . inheritance of resistance to scn was first reported in the 'peking' plant introduction, and three genes for resistance  were assigned and initially classified as recessive  <cit> . of the resistance sources, pi  <dig> has been the most widely used in breeding programs. more than 95% of the scn resistant cultivars available for planting in illinois during  <dig> received their resistance from this pi  <cit> .

the rhg <dig> locus has been shown to have the greatest impact on scn development in several resistance sources including peking, pi  <dig>  pi  <dig>  pi  <dig> and pi  <dig>  this locus provides resistance to many common scn populations such as hg type  <dig>   <cit> . multiple research groups have mapped the rhg <dig> locus to a sub-telomeric region on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> , to a location approximately  <dig>  centimorgans  from the simple sequence repeat  marker satt <dig>  <cit>  . although originally reported as a recessive locus, "rhg1" has more recently been characterized as exhibiting incomplete dominance. soybean lines heterozygous for resistant and susceptible alleles at the rhg <dig> locus often allow scn cyst formation at a rate intermediate between that of plants genotyped with satt <dig> as homozygous resistant or homozygous susceptible at the rhg <dig> locus  <cit> . a second qtl  has been identified as being necessary for full resistance to some scn populations in peking and in pi  <dig>  but not pi  <dig> or pi  <dig>  <cit> . rhg <dig> exhibits dominant gene action, and in peking-derived material the relevant alleles of both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> are necessary to exhibit the full resistance phenotype. other loci that make smaller and/or more race-specific contributions to scn resistance have also been identified throughout the soybean genome, but often a given locus was identified in only one study  <cit> .

cytological studies suggest that peking-type resistance displays host cell necrosis and cell wall appositions not seen in pi  <dig> type resistances in response to scn hg type  <dig>  <cit> . the peking and pi  <dig> rhg <dig> sources also exhibit distinct differential behaviors in their strength of resistance against particular scn test populations, suggesting at least partially different mechanisms in the scn resistance controlled by different rhg <dig> alleles  <cit> .

two groups first filed applications with the u.s. patent office in  <dig> identifying apparent leucine-rich repeat transmembrane receptor-kinase  genes currently annotated as glyma18g <dig>  and glyma08g <dig>  http://www.phytozome.net/ <cit>  as the likely scn resistance genes at both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig>  <cit> , see also  <cit> . sequences supporting the claims were released to genbank between  <dig> and  <dig>  the basis for these claims was the presence of these genes at the rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> loci, their similarity to the known rice bacterial blight resistance gene xa <dig>  and the presence of derived amino acid sequence differences between the alleles from resistant and susceptible plant genotypes. however, a decade later, no functional evidence for a role of these lrr-kinase genes in scn resistance has been reported in a peer-reviewed forum. there are numerous reasons why identification of the rhg <dig> gene that confers scn resistance is a high priority, including the extreme economic significance of scn for yield loss, the major reliance on the rhg <dig> locus in commercial soybean breeding, the detection of scn populations that overcome currently available rhg1-mediated resistance, the potential to respond to these challenges with engineered improvements in rhg <dig>  and basic scientific interest in the nature of plant resistance to scn.

an experimentally tractable transgenic assay system is a crucial component for the identification, study and manipulation of genes controlling scn resistance as well as many other soybean traits. generation of transgenic fertile soybean lines is still a difficult and expensive process that requires close to a year to obtain transgenic seed lines. agrobacterium rhizogenes has been used by many researchers as a transgene delivery system to study legume root biology, both in soybean and medicago truncatula  <cit> . transgenic roots generated using a. rhizogenes retain the scn resistance phenotypes of the parental soybean genotypes, and have been used to test genes that may impart resistance  <cit> .

function is often attributed to specific genes by the methods of gene mutation/positional cloning, phenotypic complementation via transformation with a cloned full-length gene, and/or by gene silencing. experimental silencing of plant genes has generally been elicited using hairpin rna-forming inverted repeat dna constructs or by virus-induced gene silencing  <cit> . all silencing approaches are prone to incomplete penetrance , but have nevertheless been useful for assigning function to specific genes, and for engineering useful traits. these gene silencing techniques have been used effectively in soybean and other legumes  <cit> . with the more recent discovery of endogenous micrornas as a major mode of gene regulation in many eukaryotes, artificial microrna  methods have been developed for investigator-initiated silencing of target genes  <cit> . potential advantages of amirnas may include better penetrance, absence of undesired phenotypes associated with vigs virus infections, and the capacity to limit off-target silencing of related sequences by elicitation with constructs specific for very short  target sequences. however, use of amirna technology with soybean, m. truncatula, phaseolus or other legumes has not been reported.

for the present study we refined assays that test scn resistance in transgenic roots generated with a. rhizogenes. a nematode demographic assay was developed that discriminates resistant and susceptible responses by monitoring the infecting population for progression through nematode life stages. we also developed an amirna vector system for induction of gene silencing in legume roots using a. rhizogenes assay systems. we used these tools to investigate the impact on scn resistance of the lrr-kinase gene from the rhg <dig> genomic region . our experiments expressing the lrr-kinase from a resistant  rhg <dig> locus in susceptible test lines, with or without the resistant allele at rhg <dig>  and silencing the lrr-kinase  in resistant lines, provided no evidence for a contribution of this gene to scn resistance.

RESULTS
scoring resistance using a hairy root/nematode demographics assay
in soybean, medicago truncatula and other plants for which stable transformation is difficult, transgenic "hairy roots" generated through a. rhizogenes-mediated transformation are often used to investigate gene function. a number of groups have previously shown that the resistance response to scn in a. rhizogenes-derived roots correlates well with the scn resistance phenotypes of intact soybean plants  <cit> . cyst formation is typically counted after  <dig> weeks but because the root tissues used often exhibit significantly reduced vigor 3- <dig> weeks into such assays, and to expedite and possibly improve resistance scoring, we investigated the scoring of resistance phenotypes at an earlier time point. host resistance to scn is often manifested as arrested development at specific life stages  <cit> , so we developed a "nematode demographics assay" in which scn-infested transgenic root sections were stained with acid fuchsin approximately  <dig> weeks after inoculation with nematodes. using a stereo dissecting microscope, the number of nematodes at each growth stage  was recorded for each root segment . data are expressed as a ratio: the number of nematodes within a root segment with an appearance resembling the j <dig> + adult, or j <dig> + j <dig> + adult, growth stage divided by the total number of nematodes  within the root segment. relative scn resistance or susceptibility is determined by comparison to the demographic data for known scn-resistant or scn-susceptible host genotypes tested within the same experiment. the results of two such assays are shown in figure 1d and 1e. in these and other experiments  there was a reproducible significant difference between the scn resistance phenotypes determined for known scn-susceptible and scn-resistant control genotypes.

no elevation of scn resistance observed in susceptible genotypes transformed with the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene from resistant germplasm
the rhg <dig> locus of soybean has been shown in numerous studies to be the qtl with the greatest phenotypic impact on scn resistance, and previous patents and other reports have indicated but not demonstrated that the glyma18g <dig>  gene at the rhg <dig> locus that encodes an apparent leucine-rich repeat transmembrane receptor kinase  is the source of this scn resistance. we isolated this lrr-k gene from the rhg <dig> locus using genomic dna from the soybean cultivar ina that we confirmed to exhibit scn resistance in a standard whole plant/cyst formation assay immediately prior to its use in dna isolation. ina was used because of available progeny lines that are described below; ina has peking, pi  <dig> and pi  <dig> in its pedigree but carries an lrr-k at the rhg <dig> locus that is identical in sequence to the peking allele and also similar to the pi <dig> allele. multiple independent pcr products were isolated and sequenced, and the sequences were compared to each other and to the peking sequence published in  <cit>  to identify the best clone. an agrobacterium-compatible binary vector pgwb1::ergfp7int carrying a screenable intron-gfp marker was constructed to transform soybean with candidate scn resistance genes in full-gene complementation experiments. an insert of  <dig>  kb was added to pgwb1::ergfp7int and included approximately  <dig> kb of genomic upstream dna, the predicted  <dig> bp lrr-k coding region + intron, and approximately  <dig> bp of downstream dna. scn-susceptible e <dig> was then transformed with this construct to test the impact of this lrr-k allele on scn development. using the nematode demographics assay described above, roots from soybean line e <dig> transformed with the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k did not display increased resistance to scn; nematode development progressed similarly to what was observed on e <dig> susceptible control roots transformed with the empty pgwb1::ergfp7int vector . e <dig> transformed with either an empty plasmid vector or with the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k were, however, both significantly more susceptible to scn than the resistant line ina .

the rhg <dig> locus in peking and pi  <dig> also contributes to the full scn resistance phenotype  <cit> . scn-susceptible soybean genotypes with endogenous scn-susceptible alleles at both rhg <dig> and rhg <dig>  which are then transformed with a resistant allele only of rhg <dig>  might not display a resistant phenotype. to further test the impact of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene on scn development, rhg1- lines carrying the scn-resistant peking rhg <dig> locus were tested by complementation. microsatellite markers linked to rhg <dig> and rhg <dig> were used to identify ina × e <dig> progeny lines with a  genotype . these lines were transformed with the cloned ina rhg1-locus lrr-k gene and assayed for scn development. in the combined results from two independent experiments, no significant change in the resistance to scn was detected after transformation of these genotypes with the ina -derived rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene . the two rhg1- lines transformed with an empty vector were significantly more susceptible to scn than resistant ina , while the rhg1e98076/rhg1e <dig>  rhg4ina/rhg4ina genotype transformed with the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene was not significantly more resistant than the same genotype transformed with empty vector. the mean resistance of roots transformed with the ina lrr-k gene may have been slightly greater but not to a significant extent, in contrast to the statistically significant difference between the ina and e <dig> control lines. when the nematode demographics data for these same experiments were expressed as , the results for rhg1e98076/rhg1e <dig>  rhg4ina/rhg4ina genotypes transformed with empty vector or vector + rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene were even more similar .

construction of an amirna gene silencing vector
we sought to use gene silencing as an independent means to test for contributions of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene toward scn resistance. to facilitate this work, we constructed a new vector for gene silencing in transgenic soybean roots. the binary vector psm <dig>  was designed to meet the following requirements: 1) efficient cloning of artificial micrornas, 2) constitutive strong amirna expression in legume roots as well as other tissues  <cit> , 3) reliable identification of transgenic roots by gfp screening using an intron-containing gfp that is not expressed in bacteria, 4) competence for transferring inserted dna into plant genomes via agrobacterium, and 5) high transformation efficiency. the steps taken to develop the vector are shown in figure  <dig>  as the intermediate constructs may also be of use and are available upon request. to initially confirm gfp <dig> expression in planta, psm <dig> and psm <dig> were infiltrated into n. bentamiana leaves using a. tumefaciens gv <dig>  positive and negative controls  did or did not produce green fluorescence respectively, as expected . ergfp7int expression was phenotypically detected with use of vectors psm <dig> and psm <dig> .

silencing of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase in transgenic roots
for silencing experiments, the rhg <dig> locus from the more widely used pi  <dig> source of rhg <dig> was tested using the soybean cultivar fayette. cotyledons of fayette were transformed with a. rhizogenes containing psm <dig> derivatives carrying one of two different amirnas that each were designed to specifically target the gm <dig> rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene. to determine the effectiveness of the two amirnas, rna was extracted from three independent transgenic hairy roots for each construct. semi-quantitative rt-pcr was performed in each of two independent biological replicate experiments as shown in figure 4a. the semi-quantitative rt-pcr was also performed using fayette gfp-negative hairy roots to determine the basal expression level of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene, and using fayette gfp-positive roots to verify that unmodified psm <dig> does not interfere with expression of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene. no significant differences were found between the two fayette controls . anova was utilized to evaluate differences in expression of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene. as shown in figure 4a and 4b, at  <dig> cycles only the "amirna lrr-k i" construct was able to substantially reduce the expression level  of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene in transgenic roots . no statistical difference was found for the amirna lrr-k ii, but a trend of partial down regulation was observed . the actin control did not show a significant difference among the samples.

impacts on transformation efficiency and root development
transformation efficiency was evaluated  <dig> weeks after a. rhizogenes application, with gfp used as a visual marker for successful transformation. transformation frequency was calculated as the number of cotyledons with at least one transgenic hairy root divided by the total number of inoculated cotyledons. fayette and williams  <dig> transformed with psm <dig>  psm <dig> and pgwb1::35sp-ergfp7int showed transformation efficiencies ranging from  <dig> % to 50%. no significant difference in transformation efficiency was observed between the two genotypes transformed with the different control vectors . however, when fayette cotyledons were transformed with amirna gmlrr-k i and amirna gmlrr-k ii, decreased transformation efficiency was observed. cotyledons transformed with the two lrr-kinase amirna constructs developed hairy roots roughly two weeks later, and had lower transformation efficiencies than the controls. in particular, the amirna gmlrr-k i gave the lowest transformation efficiency  and the resulting roots grew more slowly . based on two independent transformation experiments using  <dig> cotyledons of each genotype, a chi-square test revealed no significant different between williams and fayette controls for root transformation efficiency , while a significant difference was observed for amirnagmlrr-k i  and amirna gmlrr-k ii  relative to the expected rate established from fayette controls.

to evaluate potential artifactual impacts of the amirna vector in plants lacking the target gene, a transformation experiment was performed using medicago truncatula. the fayette tc <dig> sequence has only 81% identity with m. truncatula chromosome  <dig> clone mth2-155g <dig> . m. truncatula seeds were transformed with a. rhizogenes to deliver the same silencing constructs tested in soybean. three plates, each with  <dig> germinated plants, were used for each construct. three weeks after the treatment, no difference in root development was observed between m. trucatula seedlings transformed with the two amirna gmlrr-k constructs in comparison to the unmodified psm <dig> vector. the transformation efficiencies were not substantially different, ranging from 10% to 30% amongst the plates . these results indicate the amirnas designed to silence the soybean rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene have a root development impact specifically in soybeans.

no significant impact on scn resistance after partial silencing of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase
healthy transgenic gfp-positive roots expressing amirna constructs that target the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k gene  were sub-cultured by propagating the young growing tips , and were infected with ~ <dig> sterile j <dig> scn for each root. the nematode demographics assay was then used to detect relative scn resistance. the experiment was repeated with three independent biological replicates each using 4- <dig> separate transgenic hairy roots of each treatment-construct. two weeks after nematode inoculation, all nematode stages  were observed in the transgenic roots tested, and the number of nematodes at each stage was recorded. roots carrying five or fewer nematodes were excluded from further analysis. as expected, fayette control roots allowed significantly fewer nematodes to molt and progress to an apparent j <dig> or j4/adult female stage within  <dig> days relative to williams  <dig> control roots . in the key comparison to test if silencing of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene altered resistance to scn, no statistical difference in nematode development was observed between fayette and fayette carrying amirna gmlrr-k i or amirna gm-k ii .

discussion
as one part of this study, we report use of amirna technology to knock down expression of an endogenous gene in soybean. like rnai , mirnas and amirnas in plants reduce gene expression primarily by eliciting cleavage of homologous rna transcripts. the primary benefit of adopting amirna technology is specificity  <cit> . longer hairpin rna gene silencing constructs  are cleaved into multiple subfragments that, with the known tolerance for mismatches within the rna-induced silencing complex, can cause unintended silencing of non-target genes. this can readily remain undetected by the investigator. the target recognition portion of mirnas and amirnas are very short and are strand specific, and plant mirna-mediated silencing is more sequence-specific than animal mirna-mediated silencing, all of which greatly reduces the potential for unintended off-target effects on other genes. based on known target selectivity behaviors , as is commonly observed in most laboratories that work with hairpin rnas, amirnas and other engineered silencing methods.

the nematode demographics assay was developed as a modification of existing protocols that monitor scn development on transgenic soybean roots generated using a. rhizogenes  <cit> . there were multiple motivations for developing the demographics approach. first and most important, we hypothesized that a census of the developmental stages achieved by the infecting scn population mid-way through the infection life-cycle might be more sensitive than an end-stage cyst count in detecting differences in the expression scn resistance, which is a quantitative trait. previous reports indicate that morphological differences between nematode development on scn-resistant and scn-susceptible soybeans are evident relatively early - as soon as  <dig> days after infection  <cit> . gene expression profiling work has even suggested host gene expression differences between resistant and susceptible interactions in the first  <dig> hours  <cit> . a second motivation for the demographics assay was that root segments often became less healthy in appearance after 3- <dig> weeks in culture. root tips remain vigorous and continue to grow, but under our conditions, older segments such as the segments present at the time of nematode infestation start to exhibit notable decline approximately three weeks after exposure to nematodes. data collection at an earlier time point reduces this concern. a third useful attribute of the demographics assay is that results become available two weeks earlier, compared to cyst counts at  <dig> days post-infection. lastly, when first establishing the assay in our laboratory, slow-growing fungal contaminants sometimes emerged in the third or fourth week . although this issue was addressed primarily by more effective nematode surface-sterilization or use of axenic nematode cultures, use of an assay that terminates two weeks after scn application reduced contamination issues . the validity of the demographics scoring approach was supported by the significant differences in scn development we observed between known resistant and susceptible plant genotypes. acid fuchsin staining and nematode counting do require some additional effort, however, and previously published protocols that count cyst formation after 28- <dig> days remain as an acceptable alternative.

in addition to reporting amirna use for gene silencing in soybean, a vector to facilitate this approach, and the nematode demographics assay for tests of genes that may contribute to soybean scn resistance, we also report negative data regarding impacts of the rhg1-locus lrr-k gene on scn resistance. using complementation with a full-length gene under control of its native promoter, and gene knockdown using amirna technology, we were unable to detect a contribution to scn resistance by the rhg1-locus lrr-k gene from either peking/pi  <dig> or pi  <dig>  the most commonly used sources of scn resistance in u.s. soybean cultivars. an impact on root development was observed when amirna for the lrr-k gene were expressed in transgenic roots, and effects on root development have also been preliminarily reported by the lightfoot research group http://hdl.handle.net/10101/npre. <dig> . <dig>  it remains possible that this rhg1-locus lrr-k gene may in some way impact scn infection of or development on soybean roots, but no such effect was detected in our studies.

the rhg <dig> locus is of extremely high economic significance to soybean cultivation in the united states, and has received attention from multiple research groups. it is notable that more than ten years after the filing of patent applications claiming scn resistance function for the rhg1-locus lrr-k gene, no groups have published evidence  for a functional contribution to scn resistance by the rhg1-locus lrr-k gene. we note that, simultaneous with the present study, a group led by drs. khalid meksem and melissa mitchum has completed tests for functional contributions of the rhg4-locus lrr-k gene to scn resistance and, similar to our work, has not detected a contribution for this rhg <dig> candidate gene . we are also aware of work led by dr. brian diers  <cit> , in which fine-structure genetic mapping of the rhg <dig> locus has revealed chromosomal recombination events that genetically separate rhg1-b  scn resistance function from the rhg1-locus lrr-k gene. hence evidence is accumulating that the rhg <dig> locus lrr-k genes seem unlikely to be the primary source of scn resistance polymorphism. a tone of caution is appropriate, however, as our present study only provides negative data on this subject. for example, gene silencing is often partial , and the expression knockdown we achieved with amirna may have been insufficient to detectably block hypothesized scn resistance contributions . as another example, the quantitative nature of the functional contribution of any given gene to scn resistance may be difficult to detect in a. rhizogenes-generated soybean roots. hence we are cautious with our conclusion, but we can state that when scn-susceptible sources were complemented with an rhg1-locus lrr-k allele from an scn-resistant source, or when expression of the gene in resistant plants was reduced by amirna-mediated silencing, no significant impacts on scn resistance were detected.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings suggest that the nematode demographics assay can expedite testing of transgenic roots for scn resistance. amirnas may have widespread use in legume biology, and we have developed the vector psm <dig> that drives interchangeable amirna constructs through a gmubi promoter, with an intron-gfp marker for detection of transgenic roots. studies in which expression of the rhg <dig> locus lrr-kinase gene from different resistance sources was either reduced or complemented did not reveal significant impacts on scn resistance, suggesting that one or more other genes at the rhg <dig> locus may be the primary determinant of differences in scn resistance among different soybean types.
