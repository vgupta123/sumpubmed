BACKGROUND
tapeworms of the genus taenia  include parasites of mammals that use carnivores as definitive hosts, and herbivores  as intermediate hosts. humans may be infected by both adult and larval forms , causing taeniosis or cysticercosis respectively. as with all species of tapeworm, transmission from host to host follows a trophic pathway via ingestion. however, species of taenia are unique amongst the cestoda in requiring two obligate mammalian hosts for transmission and life cycle completion; egg to herbivore, herbivore to carnivore, the cestode matures in the carnivore and releases fertilized eggs  <cit> . taenia also enters humans trophically, through the inadvertent consumption of eggs or larval stages present in undercooked meat. human taenia species include t. saginata goeze,  <dig>  t. asiatica eom & rim,  <dig>  and t. solium linnaeus,  <dig>  with the following zoonotic species also found in humans: t. taeniaeformis , t. crassiceps , t. multiceps leske,  <dig>  and t. serialis . species of taenia cause significant health problems and considerable socio-economic losses when infecting humans and livestock  <cit> ; human neurocysticercosis is the most common helminth infection of the central nervous system and has considerable societal impact in endemic areas  <cit> . the genus is widespread globally, with hotspots of prevalence in humans related to diet, social conditions, cultural practices and poverty. in the wild prevalence is dictated by specific predator-prey interactions, and there is little doubt their influence on host ecology is significant  <cit> .

historically, as an old genus, taenia  has become somewhat of a 'catch-all' taxon for tapeworm systematics, with upwards of  <dig> nominal species having been attributed to taenia. species circumscription based on morphology has been, and remains, problematic. approximately  <dig> valid species and  <dig> subspecies are recognized currently  <cit> , circumscribed predominantly on the basis of adult morphology; other names persist and largely arise from descriptions of larval stages or the use of some of the many synonyms  <cit> . there are conflicting estimates of phylogeny from morphology and various molecular markers, thus preventing a full understanding of the evolutionary history with their hosts through space and time. taenia is one of only two genera in the taeniidae. the other genus in the family, echinococcus, is also of importance as it causes morbidity in humans and livestock  <cit> . as a result of their importance, species of these two genera have been studied extensively, but relatively little is understood about their biology in the context of molecular ecology, epidemiology or control. much of this comes from an inability to quickly, or accurately, diagnose species or to track populations. in many endemic areas diseases caused by human taenia are often categorized as 'neglected tropical diseases'  <cit> .

as is widely recognized for many parasites, knowledge of life cycles, mechanisms and dynamics of transmission and infection, all form the basis for effective control strategies  <cit> . molecular tools are increasingly used to develop these areas of knowledge, and here we take a comparative mitogenomic approach to evaluate mitochondrial  dnas as a source of new molecular markers.

mitochondrial genes are amongst the most popular markers for molecular-based approaches to ecology, population genetics and evolutionary biology and have been popular targets for molecular-based methods of species identification  <cit> . multiplex pcr approaches to diagnose mixed infections of taenia are also being developed and are targeted for pcr-rflp analysis using mt cytochrome c oxidase subunit i  and cytb  <cit> . certain genes and gene regions have become popular choices as representative mitochondrial markers, because they are bordered by regions of sequence conservation  and 'universal'  pcr primer sets can be readily designed. this is also the case for helminths, where mt gene fragments have been used routinely for population genetics, ecology and diagnostics  <cit> . more recently, the ability to readily characterize complete helminth mtdnas, by means of long pcr and a variety of sequencing techniques  <cit> , has prompted an assessment of entire genomes as a source for phylogenetic analysis  <cit> , and their comparison to reveal variation within and between genes in order to develop novel  molecular markers  <cit> . mitochondrial genomes of bilaterian animals are short, circular dna molecules typically 14- <dig> kb in length, without introns and with short intergenic regions. gene content is highly conserved with typically  <dig> protein coding genes in platyhelminthes , two ribosomal subunits and  <dig> trnas. mitochondrial gene rearrangement is not uncommon in flatworms, occurring within the genus schistosoma  <cit> , in some monogeneans  <cit>  and appears to be different in at least some turbellarians  <cit> . evidence suggests that gene order is otherwise generally conserved in tapeworms  and flukes   <cit> .

complete mtdnas offer variation over multiple levels of organization, from gene content and gene order to variation in amino acids and nucleotides, offering opportunities to resolve both recent and ancient divergence events. here we characterize the complete mt genomes of t. multiceps leske,  <dig>  t. hydatigena pallas,  <dig> and t. pisiformis , each of intrinsic interest. coenurosis is a debilitating disease caused by the metacestode  of t. multiceps and is common in sheep and other herbivores. humans may also be infected with the metacestode occasionally  <cit> ; infections occur when eggs are ingested via the fecal-oral route of transmission. infective eggs hatch, and the liberated oncospheres cross the membrane of the small intestine and migrate within the body, typically ending up in the central nervous system, mesentery and visceral organs  <cit> . within the host's tissues, the oncospheres mature into coenuri or cysticerci causing the metacestodiasis. amongst carnivores, each of these  <dig> species is cosmopolitan in canines and t. hydatigena and t. pisiformis are also found in felines. in china, sheep are the most common hosts for metacestodes of t. multiceps and t. hydatigena, and lagomorphs are the most common hosts of t. pisiformis tapeworms; their distribution across china and surrounding countries is extensive  <cit> . each of the species characterized here is found globally, and mixed infections with other taeniids are common. for accurate diagnosis, there is a need to identify individual species from mixed infections of tapeworms whether in intermediate or definitive hosts. differentiating adult worms using morphology alone requires taxonomic expertise, but to differentiate amongst mixed populations of eggs and larvae requires molecular techniques  <cit> . once developed, molecular techniques can be readily applied to portions of adult worms, larvae, eggs and environmental samples and should aid in accurate, rapid identification.

among the genus taenia, complete mt genome sequences are already available for t. asiatica, t. saginata, t. solium and t. crassiceps  <cit> . we use these sequences with the new data to achieve three goals. firstly, we evaluate the potential for complete mt genomes in estimating the phylogeny of the genus and revealing its evolutionary history. taenia is a species-rich genus with a widespread distribution but there are conflicting estimates of phylogeny from morphology and various molecular markers. secondly, we use comparative mitogenomics to highlight regions of nucleotide variation amongst taenia species to investigate whether mitochondrial gene fragments currently used as molecular markers offer the best regions for characterization, whether for species recognition or other molecular-based applications. third, we take an in silico approach to developing pcr primer pairs designed to amplify short fragments of mtdnas for all species , with a view to providing primers that will work for all taenia species capturing high levels of variation in mtdnas, and we test some of these primers to demonstrate their efficacy.

RESULTS
general features of the mt genome of  <dig> taenia species
the mtdnas of cestodes are similar to those of other eumetazoans with respect to length, gene composition, and the structures of their trna and rrna molecules  <cit> . the complete mtdna sequences of t. multiceps, t. hydatigena and t. pisiformis were  <dig>  bp,  <dig>  bp and  <dig>  bp in length, respectively, of which t. pisiformis mtdna sequence is the smallest among the platyhelminthes studied to date . yap et al.  <cit>  reported that restriction mapping of the t. hydatigena mt genome suggested it to be  <dig>  kb, but no published complete mt genomes sequences from taeniids have been more than  <dig> kb in length. the size of t. pisiformis mtdna in this study is also among the smallest reported for metazoans; only  <dig> other metazoan mtdnas are known to be smaller  <cit> . in general, gene size, organization, codon use and nucleotide content are very similar amongst the newly sequenced taenia species and those already characterized.

start and stop codons for protein-coding genes as well as lengths of their predicted amino acid sequences and trna gene anticodons . snr and lnr refer to short and long non-coding regions respectively.

each of the  <dig> mtdnas contained  <dig> genes lacking atp synthase subunit  <dig> gene , of which  <dig> were protein-coding genes ,  <dig> were trna genes  and the small  and large  subunits of rrna, as found in other platyhelminthes  <cit> . the mt gene arrangements of these  <dig> cestodes are identical to that of other taeniids and only slightly different from that of hymenolepis diminuta by the reversal in order of trns <dig> and trnl <dig>  <cit> .

all genes are transcribed in the same direction. some genes overlap in the mtdnas, which is also true for other flatworm species. the 3'-end of nad4l overlaps with the 5'-end of nad <dig> as observed in all flatworms; length of overlaps is the same  in all taenia species  <cit> . however, in the published annotations of e. multilocularis  and t. solium , nad4l and nad <dig> do not overlap, which needs to be revised according to our alignment; in these cases nad4l ends on legitimate stop codons before nad <dig> begins  <cit>  and there are no indications from our alignment that they are incorrect. additional gene overlaps were observed between 3'-end of cox <dig> and the 5'-end of trnt , between trnq and trnf, and trnf and trnm . a full list of inferred gene boundaries and lengths are given in table  <dig> 

as with other flatworm mtdnas, the nucleotide compositions of the new sequences are biased toward t and a, with t being the most favored nucleotide and c the least favored  <cit> . at-richness in t. multiceps is  <dig> % , in t. hydatigena is  <dig> %  - the lowest for any taeniid studied to date - and in t. pisiformis  <dig> % , shown in additional file  <dig>  at-bias in taenia species is higher than amongst echinococcus species, but not unusual amongst cestodes  <cit> . amongst protein coding genes at-content varies from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. amongst taenia species cytochrome c oxidase genes tend to have lower, or the lowest, at-content  <cit>  and long  and short non-coding regions  tend to have the highest at-content .

flatworms employ an unusual mitochondrial code for translating codons into amino acids  <cit> . gtg is being proposed as an alternative initiation codon to atg in nad <dig> and cox <dig> genes of t. hydatigena, in cox <dig> of t. pisiformis and in nad <dig> and nad <dig> genes of t. multiceps. we also infer an even more unusual start codon, gtt, in atp <dig> of t. pisiformis; this has been suggested for cox <dig> of e. granulosus   <cit>  and h. diminuta   <cit> . to avoid potential sequencing errors, we confirmed gtt as a start codon in t. pisiformis by sequencing the region  five times using pcr products directly and cloned recombinant plasmids from two isolates of t. pisiformis cysticerci. two abbreviated stop codons were also found in mt protein-coding genes nad <dig> and cox <dig> of t. pisiformis, as found in nad <dig> and cox <dig> of diphyllobothrium latum, d. nihonkaiense  <cit>  and spirometra erinaceieuropaei , shown in additional file  <dig> 

structure of trnas
using arwen  <cit>  nearly all  <dig> trnas, with the conventional secondary structures, were found for each mt genome. remaining trnas were identified using alignment and inferred secondary structures . mitochondrial trna genes were 55- <dig> bp long, and the predicted secondary structures of  <dig> of these had typical clover-leaf shapes with paired dihydrouridine  arms. the trnc, trnr and two trns trnas contained a predicted secondary structure with the tΨc arm and loop but lacked the dhu arm and loop, as found in some other platyhelminth mtdnas  <cit> . anticodons in all  <dig> trnas for all taenia species are conserved without mutations. the first two nucleotides preceding the anticodons are almost always thymidine, the first nucleotide following the anticodons is usually adenosine or guanosine, and the second is guanosine.

structure of snr and lnr
the non-coding regions of the mt genomes of t. multiceps, t. hydatigena and t. pisiformis comprised  <dig> major regions: a short non-coding region  or nr <dig>  and a long non-coding region  or nr <dig> . among published taeniid mtdnas the lnr of t. pisiformis is the shortest. snr and lnr were located between trny and trnl <dig> , and nad <dig> and trng, respectively.

in the lnr regions of t. multiceps and t. hydatigena mt genomes and the nr <dig> of t. pisiformis mt genome, there were sets of short inverted repeats . one could be folded into a hairpin structure characterized by  <dig> to  <dig> consecutive g_c or inconsecutive base pairs at the upside of the stem. although the snr and nr <dig> were short, there was at least one inverted sequence in these regions. a significantly stable potential secondary structure containing a stem-loop could be folded using snr or nr <dig>  similar inverted sequences and stem-loop secondary or hairpin structure are also found in these two regions of other taeniid mt genomes  <cit> . besides lnr of t. multiceps mt genome, one inverted repeat sequence  was displayed in lnr of t. asiatica, t. saginata, t. solium and t. crassiceps mt genomes, and another similar inverted sequence  appeared also in nr <dig> of t. pisiformis mtdna. stable hairpin structures, such as those identified in the lnr and the snr of taeniid mtdnas  <cit> , likely contain the origins of replication and transcription  <cit> .

phylogeny of taenia
using a variety of shared characteristics including those defining adult morphology  and larval structure, hoberg et al.  <cit>  compiled  <dig> characters for  <dig> species of taenia. parsimony analysis found  <dig> equally parsimonious trees, and the consensus tree has since been used to infer patterns of intermediate and definitive host association  <cit> . inferred switching between carnivore definitive hosts led hoberg  <cit>  to conclude that ecological shifts have been greatly responsible for the patterns of radiation in taenia. this study highlighted the likely role of climatological and ecological perturbation in influencing host-parasite associations in the genus. the morphology-based phylogeny has not been supported by partial molecular data sets from subsets of taxa, but establishing a reliable phylogeny for the genus clearly has important consequences.

early attempts to infer molecular phylogenies of taenia have been hampered by the availability of different species, and the application of relatively crude models of molecular evolution. nevertheless, two studies provide perspective in assessing estimates from new complete mtdna and the morphological data. de queiroz and alkire  <cit>  compiled available partial cox <dig> data and partial nuclear large subunit  rdna data to infer a phylogeny including  <dig> species of taenia. lavikainen et al.  <cit>  sampled multiple isolates of  <dig> taenia species for partial cox <dig> and partial nad <dig> genes; this built on data collected by gasser et al.  <cit> . in each of these studies, all the species for which complete mtdnas are now available were included, thus allowing direct comparison of phylogenetic estimates of  <dig> species of taenia.

alignment of all protein-coding genes of taenia mtdnas and outgroups provided  <dig>  unambiguously aligned amino acids available for phylogenetic analysis, of which  <dig> were variable and  <dig>  parsimony-informative. alignment of all nucleotides provided  <dig>  unambiguously aligned sites, of which  <dig>  were variable and  <dig>  parsimony-informative. to avoid potential problems of saturation, only coding positions that were shown to be unsaturated were included in the nucleotide analysis; leaving  <dig>  unambiguously aligned sites of which  <dig>  were variable and  <dig>  parsimony-informative. bayesian analysis yielded phylogenies with maximal nodal support throughout the amino acid , and nucleotide  estimates. the interrelationships of taenia based on complete mtdnas were different between estimates from amino acids and nucleotides, and previously estimated phylogenies based on either morphology  or molecular data . consistent among all phylogenetic estimates is the sister group status between t. asiatica and t. saginata, as expected, since these species are known to be very closely related  <cit> ; recent evidence has demonstrated on-going hybridization between these species  <cit> . molecular estimates from complete mtdnas, partial mt and nuclear gene fragments consistently reveal t. multiceps as most closely related to t. saginata + t. asiatica. the placement of t. multiceps in this clade suggests a common intermediate host of members of the suidae . additional taxon sampling is required to further test the inferences of intermediate and definitive host switching in the genus made by hoberg  <cit> . beyond this clade, no two molecular estimates are identical with respect to the remaining species. the interrelationships of t. hydatigena, t. crassiceps and t. pisiformis in the mtdna analysis are different from one another, but together they clearly form a clade , in contrast to previous estimates. it is noteworthy that the nodal support in previous studies, using only small fragments of dna, was generally very poor throughout the estimated phylogenies , in contrast to the very robust support offered by complete mtdna amino acid analysis. although additional evidence is required to resolve the interrelationships of the t. crassiceps, t. hydatigena and t. pisiformis clade, the analysis of amino acids suggests additional mtdnas of taenia species can be incorporated readily to provide a wider estimate of taeniid phylogeny.

further studies are required to elucidate the source of incongruence between the amino acid and nucleotide estimates, but it may be the result of added homoplasy from the ribosomal genes, trna genes and non-coding regions included in the analysis. whether the more sophisticated bayesian model  used for the amino acid analysis has provided a more accurate estimate of interrelationships of taenia, which requires further testing, additional sampling of nuclear genes, such as complete 18s and complete 28s rdna  <cit> , may be useful in providing  <dig> independent estimates  of phylogeny. parsimony mapping of morphological characters detailed by hoberg et al.  <cit>  onto the mtdna amino acid phylogeny, using only the  <dig> taenia species common to both studies, suggests  <dig> morphological characters might support nodes in the novel topology in figure 1a; these included characters  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . however, a full assessment of the morphological data set, by means of an independent molecular-based phylogeny is premature without additional sampling of taenia species.

nucleotide variation within and between taenia mtdnas
sliding window analysis of the nucleotide alignment of all available taenia mtdnas provided an indication of nucleotide diversity  within and between mitochondrial genes . the plot readily shows the high degree of nucleotide variation within and between genes amongst the aligned taenia genomes for any given window of  <dig> bp , and the possibility that hitherto untested regions of mtdnas may be of utility. genbank holds relatively few mitochondrial markers for a few species of taenia, used variously for population genetics and diagnostics, but include partial fragments of cox <dig>  cytb  <cit> , nad <dig>  <cit> , rrns and atp <dig> . sliding window analysis , indicates that genes with high sequence variability included nad <dig> , nad <dig> , atp <dig> , nad <dig>  and nad <dig> . genes with the lowest sequence variability  include cox <dig> , cox <dig>  and rrns . sequence variability within genes appears to be highest, with notable peaks and troughs of π, in cox <dig>  rrns and nad <dig>  a plot of the number of phylogenetically informative sites in the same alignment, and using the same sliding window parameters, revealed a very close correlation between sequence variability and phylogenetically informative sites , allowing π to be used as a readily available proxy for phylogenetic signal; dnasp  <cit>  calculates π easily, but the plot of phylogenetically informative positions is more tedious. nucleotide variability within species tends to reflect the same pattern observed amongst closely related species . combined, these results suggest alternative gene regions are worthy of consideration in developing new genetic markers for phylogenetics, population genetics and diagnostics. current mt genes used as targets for multiplexed pcr-rflp based approaches to diagnostics  <cit>  include cox <dig> and cytb; cox <dig> is also a chosen target for a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification method of diagnosis  <cit> . although relatively easy to amplify routinely, cox <dig> is amongst the slowest evolving, and least variable of genes available in the entire mtdna suggesting that more reliable, or at least more informative, markers should be considered for future work, especially diagnostics involving mixed infections or other taenia species.

in silico prediction of novel mitochondrial markers for taenia species
prifi  <cit>  was used to predict primer pairs capable of amplifying 500- <dig> bp lengths of any taenia mtdna. this length was chosen since amplicons of ~ <dig> bp are amenable to a diversity of qualitative and quantitative analyses . as with many algorithms developed for primer design, changing search and filtering parameters can yield primers of variable quality. figure  <dig> illustrates the positions of all primers found with one particular setting, chosen to minimize nucleotide degeneracy whilst maximizing inclusiveness across taenia species. three primer pairs were selected for their high score , and were found in nad <dig>  rrns and nad <dig>  genes of medium to high nucleotide diversity, but likely exceeding the variability offered by popular gene regions such as cox <dig> and cytb. primer pairs were: a  forward 5'-cartttcgtaagggbccwaawaaggt, reverse 5'-ccaatttcytgaagttaacagcatca; b  forward 5'- aggggataggrcacagtgccagcatctgcgg, reverse 5'- aattcatttaaagttaccttgttacgacttacctc; c  forward 5'- tatatgagttagttttaagcattaattatgg, reverse 5'- ggaaahctagcactcttdgtaa. primers a, b and c yield fragments of taenia mitochondrial dna approximately  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively and capture  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> variable positions in the total alignment of the taenia mtdnas; equivalent to  <dig> % of the overall variable nucleotide positions . efficacy of the  <dig> primer pairs herein designed was tested with pcr method. as expected, the  <dig> target pcr amplification bands were observed for the genus taenia .

CONCLUSIONS
taenia species are important socio-economic parasites because they have a significant impact on human, domestic and wild animal health. complete mtdnas of taenia provide an example of the extremely economic and compact organization of flatworm mtdnas. analysis of amino acids of mtdnas provides a well-supported phylogeny for taenia species, at odds with estimates from morphology; t. multiceps is more closely related to t. saginata and t. asiatica than to t. solium, and that t. hydatigena, t. crassiceps and t. pisiformis form a monophyletic group. additional mitochondrial markers for the study of taenia highlighted by this study include those for which high nucleotide variability has been identified . in silico analysis of all available mtdnas of taenia, suggested new primers capable of capturing higher levels of mitochondrial nucleotide diversity than those currently used for diagnosis or molecular ecology. these data have implications for molecular diagnostic methods, epidemiological investigations and systematic studies of taeniid parasites.
