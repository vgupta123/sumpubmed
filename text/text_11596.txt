BACKGROUND
we are interested in understanding the regulation of muscle metabolism and its inter-relationships with development, exercise and ageing. a particular focus is the regulation of mitochondrial content which is reported to impact on metabolic syndrome in humans  <cit>  and rats  <cit> , feed efficiency in livestock  <cit>  and mammalian ageing  <cit> . mitochondrial content also contributes to athletic performance  <cit>  and post-mortem meat quality  <cit>  through the connection to muscle fibre type. the physiological connection between inflammation and muscle biology in the context of training, muscle remodelling and ageing is also of interest. for example, during exercise, muscle is routinely subject to various stressors, such as mechanical damage, hypoxia and ph decline that set in motion a pro-inflammatory cascade  <cit>  which has implications for tissue remodelling. previously, using a network science approach in cattle  <cit>  we identified the product of the ring finger protein  gene , an incompletely characterised transcriptional regulator, as a factor that might influence not only mitochondrial transcription and function but also immune function. in this study we aimed to explore and validate the accuracy of this reverse-engineering under the tightly controlled experimental conditions afforded by in vitro cell culture.

a major foundation of our predicted function of the rnf <dig> protein was a bovine co-expression network  <cit> . various metabolic and developmental processes were prioritised for further scrutiny on the basis of forming cohesive co-expression network gene sets or ‘modules.’ to build the network, bovine muscle sampled at different times during pre- and post-natal development, between genetically divergent breeds and following nutritional intervention, were subject to microarray analysis. by hunting in the module of interest for transcriptional regulators , or asking the related question “which transcriptional regulator has the highest absolute, average correlation to all the genes in the module?”, we generated a ranked list of regulators predicted to control the processes in question.

these approaches correctly identified groups of genes already known to play a role in mammalian skeletal muscle biology, including master regulators of the cell cycle , fast twitch muscle development  and mitochondrial biogenesis   <cit> . several regulatory molecules of unassigned or poorly documented function were also implicated in some of these processes, and they became candidates for future gene function validation efforts. while most genes are clearly defined within the network, one prominent gene, ring zinc finger  <dig>  a transcriptional co-activator known to bind the androgen receptor  <cit> , gave apparently ambiguous results. namely, it was assigned likely roles in two different processes by our analysis – immune function and mitochondrial function  <cit> . given that the majority of connections in the co-expression network are positive, the prediction is that an increase in the activity of the ‘regulator’ will increase the expression of the ‘target’ genes.

a separate analysis on a different data set used a differential network strategy called regulatory impact factor analysis   <cit>  to contrast mitochondrial-rich brown fat versus mitochondrial-poor white fat in mice. this analysis independently assigned high likelihood to a causal role for rnf <dig> in driving the phenotype differences between these cell types, also suggestive of a role in mitochondrial function and content  <cit> . little is known of the function of the rnf <dig> protein, other than it is broadly expressed across tissues  <cit>  and is a transcriptional co-activator that interacts with the androgen receptor transcription factor in pathways relating to sex steroid signalling. from a structural perspective, there are six rnf <dig> transcript variants in humans and three in mouse, in both cases producing two different protein isoforms.

the objective of this study was to characterise the regulatory role of two rnf <dig> isoforms in mouse muscle. we achieved this via experimental upregulation followed by functional analysis of the subsequent genome-wide transcriptional readout. we performed a transient transfection of transcript variants encoding the two different isoforms in mouse c2c <dig> cells. the resultant gene expression perturbations in a number of chemokines, interferon regulatory factors and related interferon signalling molecules support a role for rnf <dig> in skeletal muscle-mediated immune and inflammatory function. additionally, the longer transcript variant  <dig>  which encodes a protein isoform containing an rwd domain, yielded a coordinate upregulation trend of all mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins present on the array platform  reinforcing the proposed link to the mitochondrion.

RESULTS
expression constructs
pcr resulted in two differently sized rnf <dig> amplicons from mouse muscle cdna. these amplicons were individually cloned and sequenced. in both cases the sequences exhibited >99% sequence identity to the genbank rnf <dig> sequence. the longer sequence was  <dig> bp and blastn aligned this sequence to the mus musculus rnf <dig> transcript variant  <dig>  the shorter sequence we amplified was  <dig> bp, and this was aligned by blastn to the mus musculus rnf <dig> transcript variant  <dig> .

rnf <dig> transcript variant  <dig> contains an orf capable of producing e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase rnf <dig> protein isoform a and rnf <dig> transcript variant  <dig> the orf for e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase rnf <dig> protein isoform b. the two isoforms are identical at the c-terminus end of the protein, while the longer isoforms has an rwd domain at the n-terminus end not present on the shorter isoform. variant  <dig> does not encode a protein.

microarray expression measurements
the array platform used to interrogate the c2c <dig> response to transfection measures genome-wide transcriptional changes using  <dig>  probes. this platform contains three probes predicted to bind rnf14; ilmn_ <dig>  ilmn_ <dig>  ilmn_ <dig>  their proposed binding sites are illustrated on figure  <dig>  probe ilmn_ <dig> was elevated ~ <dig> -fold in the variant  <dig> transfected cells and  <dig> -fold in the variant  <dig> transfected cells. this  <dig> -fold change made rnf <dig> the 9th most differentially expressed  gene found in cells transfected with variant  <dig> out of the  <dig>  probes with detectable signals in at least one treatment. correcting for an overall transfection efficiency of ~10% implies that an individual transfected cell showed an increase in expression of 34-fold and 11-fold respectively.

the other two rnf <dig> probes did not report a change in expression of rnf <dig> following transfection, including ilmn_ <dig>  predicted to bind variants  <dig> and  <dig> but not transcript variant  <dig> . it is not clear whether these  <dig> probes are reporting correctly. to unravel these observations and to further document the technical implentation of the rnf <dig> transfections we performed qrt-pcr on the rna prepared from the transfected c2c <dig> cultures using primers designed to detect the transfection construct produced mrna and endogenous forms of rnf <dig> mrna.

assuming a transfection efficiency of ~10%, the fold-changes for the transfected cells are ~33-fold and 12-fold on a per cell basis . the location of the probes in the different rnf <dig> transcripts is given in figure  <dig> 

qrt-pcr expression measurements
to compare and contrast the rnf <dig> transcript variants in the different treatment groups, we designed a set of discriminatory qrt-pcr primers . the anova model for the analysis of ct values from the qpcr experiments accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation. the two main effects  and their interaction were all highly significant .

transciption from the actb gene was used as a control. a schematic of the known mouse rnf <dig> mrna species is presented in figure  <dig> 

the normalised expression results are summarised in table  <dig>  all primer sets yielded unique dissociation curves indicating the presence of rnf <dig> transcripts in the anticipated samples. the no template controls yielded no product in all cases. the transfection of rnf <dig> variant  <dig> was clearly evident in the variant  <dig> transfected cells but not the other c2c <dig> cultures . the transcriptional output of this expression construct was also clearly detectable in the primer set that amplifies all rnf <dig> mrna species  yielding a 30-fold increase . the disparity between this result and the array fold-change is presumably attributable to the enhanced sensitivity of qrt-pcr.

the standard error is  <dig>  in all cases because we performed a system-wide normalization. ‘no amplification’ denotes multiple dissociation peaks i.e. non-specific amplification.

similarly, the transfection of the rnf <dig> variant  <dig> was also clearly detectable in the variant  <dig> transfected cells but not the other cell cultures . the expression by the construct was not as effective as for variant  <dig> and was not reflected in increased amplification by the all rnf <dig> species  primer set, presumably because it forms a much more modest proportion of all the rnf <dig> mrna species in the system. there was very little variability in native rnf <dig> expression  across the three treatment groups. overall, these findings imply the global transcriptional readout in the transfected c2c <dig> cells described by the microarray platform can be attributed to the impact of the transfection of the rnf <dig> variants.

functional enrichment analyses
with regard to the microarray analysis, a mixed-model normalisation procedure was applied to the raw intensity values, as previously described  <cit> . clustering on columns discriminates the treatments based on global considerations of the gene expression patterns. the visualisation of the clustering analysis indicated that two of the six control samples were outliers and hence were removed for the subsequent de analysis. overall, the global gene expression patterns in the two control groups  could not be discriminated from each other. consequently, the gene expression values for the two control groups were combined to form a single control for the purposes of computing de between controls and treatments. the rnf <dig> variant  <dig> and  <dig> transfected cells were both clustered separately to the controls  and separate to each other .

we computed a list of de genes  as previously described  <cit> , performing the analysis at the probe level. to explore the genome-wide expression output for functional enrichment we determined statistically significant de for each treatment contrast. we then submitted the de lists versus a background list of all genes present on the array to the gorilla webtool  <cit> , which uses hypergeometric statistics to determine functional enrichments.

with regard to upregulation following over-expression of the shorter variant  <dig>  “response to biotic stimulus”, “chemokine activity” and “extracellular region” gave p-values of  <dig> e- <dig>   <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> for the process, function and component ontological levels respectively.

with regard to upregulation following over-expression of the longer variant  <dig>  the top functional enrichments were “immune response,” chemokine activity” and “extracellular region” with hypergeometric p-values of  <dig>  e- <dig>   <dig>  e- <dig> and  <dig>  e- <dig> 

various extracellular region components were clearly among the most downregulated genes following transfection with both variants . the enrichment was highly significant in both cases, but more significant in the transcript  <dig>  compared to the transcript  <dig> transfected cells .

contrasting effects of the variant  <dig> transfection with that of the variant  <dig> transfection yielded similar functional enrichments of “response to biotic stimulus” , signal transducer activity  and extracellular region . the identity of the perturbed genes is further illustrated on figure  <dig> and tabulated on tables  <dig> and  <dig>  the normalised mean expression results for the entire data set are in additional file  <dig>  transfection with the empty construct could not be discriminated from untransfected cells, ruling out the possibility that these responses are an experimental artefact relating to the presence of the construct. the overall spread of the perturbed transcripts is greater  in the variant  <dig> transfected cells, which may reflect the greater abundance of the variant  <dig> based construct.

we also computed a modified de metric called phenotypic impact factors   <cit> , a product of the average abundance of the gene and its de. we have previously found that this accounts for the increased noise of the rarer transcripts and increases the sensitivity for detecting de of the more abundant transcripts  <cit> . figure  <dig> illustrates those genes either de or awarded a high pif score in at least one of the two transfections. immune and mitochondrial genes are highlighted based on functional annotations performed by importing the list into the david web tool  <cit> . immune genes and nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes are prominent among the de genes but the direction of change is not consistent.

on the other hand, among the significant pif transcripts in the cells transfected with the long transcript variant are three of the  <dig> mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins . moreover, a deeper exploration shows that all the mitochondrially-encoded genes represented on the array  display a coherent trend of upregulation in the variant  <dig> transfected cells based on at least one probe . the standard error bars for figure  <dig> were calculated using the standard curve method  <cit> . a subset of these mitochondrially encoded genes that are significantly de as assayed in pairwise comparisons are also highlighted on figure  <dig>  the upregulation of mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins was not observed in the rnf <dig> variant  <dig> transfected cells . the full list of de and differentially pif genes can be found in additional file  <dig>

motif analysis and bioinformatics
we next attempted to identify regulatory motifs that are conserved among the rnf <dig> responsive genes in an attempt to determine the cellular pathway linking rnf <dig> upregulation to the observed mitochondrial and inflammatory output. hunting for conserved transcription factor binding sites  <dig> bp upstream of the de genes using whole genome rvista for mouse, enriched for hfh <dig> in both the variant  <dig>  and variant  <dig> transfection experiments .

we also undertook a combination of bioinformatic analyses and literature mining. a protein motif analysis of rnf <dig> within uniprotkb indicated the presence of 1) an n-terminal destruction box which could act as a recognition signal for ubiquitin proteosome degradation and 2) ring type zinc finger essential for interaction with ube2e <dig> 

discussion
in an attempt to infer the functional role of the rnf <dig> protein, previously found to be co-expressed with mitochondrial and immune genes in developing bovine longissimus muscle, we transfected each of two rnf <dig> transcript variants into a mouse myoblast cell line. interestingly, and despite low expression levels of that transcript, transfection with transcript variant  <dig> culminated in a significant upregulation in the transcription of three of the  <dig> mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial genes   <cit> . furthermore, while we only have microarray expression data for  <dig> of the  <dig> of these genes  a deeper exploration shows that the remaining nine all display a modest but coherent trend of upregulation. the direction of this observation is consistent with the initial network connections being based on positive rather than negative co-expression values. while the fold-change is only  <dig>  to  <dig> -fold, all these transcripts are very abundantly expressed which provides a favourable signal to noise ratio for reliable detection. the array does not report on the  <dig> mitochondrially encoded trnas and two ribosomal rnas that make up the remaining transcriptional output of the mammalian mitochondrion, which encodes  <dig> different genes in total.

the expression of a number of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins was also upregulated following transfection of rnf <dig> variant  <dig> . for example, cmpk <dig>   is a nucleoside monophosphate kinase that localises to the mitochondria and has previously been found to be tightly correlated with macrophage activation and inflammation  <cit> . a very recent publication has documented rnf <dig> as a positive regulator of canonical wnt signalling in human cells  <cit> , with canonical wnt signalling previously reported to be a potent activator of mitochondrial biogenesis  <cit> . this recent body of work clearly complements our findings linking rnf <dig> with mitochondrial physiology.

while the broad transcriptional impact of rnf <dig> variant  <dig> transfection on our samples was in line with our functional prediction, there were some interesting deviations. firstly, the nuclear and mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins occupy distinct parts of the original bovine muscle co-expression network  <cit> . while rnf <dig> sits in the nuclear-encoded portion of the in vivo bovine network, transfection with variant  <dig> appears to exert the most coherent transcriptional influence on the mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins. by way of contrast, rnf <dig> variant  <dig> transfection did not lead to a detectable change on the expression of mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial genes, despite an overabundance of the variant  <dig> transcript in the variant  <dig> transfected cells.

both rnf <dig> variants influenced expression of genes encoding proteins relating to immune function. unlike the mitochondrially-encoded mitochondrial proteins upregulated observed in rnf <dig> variant  <dig> transfected cells, genes belonging to inflammatory processes were both up- and downregulated. prominent among the perturbed immune genes were chemokines , interferon regulatory factors and related interferon responsive and signalling genes . in humans following eccentric exercise, the in vivo inflammatory response includes activation of chemokines  <cit> . a number of these genes also imply apoptosis, a mitochondrial phenomenon  <cit> . these data go some way towards resolving the question posed by our apparently ambiguous  observations from the bovine muscle co-expression network, and imply that both mitochondrial and immune predictions are supported, depending on the particular transcript variant under consideration.

both rnf <dig> motifs  indicate some involvement in ubiquitin mediated proteolysis which ties in with apoptosis, and ube2e <dig> is known to play a specific role in adaptive immunity signalling. the motif analysis shows that most of the large transcription factor motifs  of the protein reside in the c-terminus shared by both isoforms, while the missing amino acids in the shorter isoform result in the loss of an rwd domain. we hypothesise that the rwd domain accounts for the mitochondrial response observed after transfection with rnf <dig> transcript variant  <dig>  recent work has emphasised deep functional connections between mitochondria and innate immunity in general  <cit> , and mitochondria and antiviral processing in particular  <cit> , which is clearly of interest given the very same dual roles outlined here for rnf <dig> 

the downregulation of a set of extracellular region and extracellular matrix transcripts following transfection with both rnf <dig> transcript variants was unexpected. example downregulated molecules common to both transfections included multiple collagen isoforms , other matrix structural components  and matrix remodelers . we ascribe these observations to one of two phenomena. on the one hand, it may reinforce the transmission of the immune signals we have observed, as it has been documented that the extracellular matrix plays a crucial role in the inflammatory process  <cit> . alternatively, the signal may correspond to differences in myocyte progression through proliferation and differentiation, the transition through which is known to be accompanied by various changes in matrix-mediated adhesion  <cit> .

interpreting the various lines of evidence linking rnf <dig> protein to immune and mitochondrial functions is complicated by the cross-species sources of data. the original co-expression prediction of rnf14’s gene function was made mainly from bovine expression data. disentangling the various pieces of information is challenging given cattle are a non-model organism and we have incomplete knowledge of bovine functional genomics. for example, it is not clear how many bovine rnf <dig> transcript variants exist in total, which clearly complicates our  interpretation of the agilent probe that provided the original foundation for some of the predictions.

nevertheless, the outcome of this validation experiment supports three of our systems biology gene discovery approaches: 1) partial correlation and information theory   <cit>  2) module-to-regulator analysis  <cit>  and 3) regulatory impact factors  <cit> . while there is some overlap in the exact molecules present in the co-expression modules and those perturbed in this subsequent transfection experiment , the overlap is very patchy. this implies that predictions based on considerations of co-expression or differential co-expression are perhaps best made in terms of broad function rather than specific molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
rnf <dig>  which encodes a transcriptional co-factor, acts via two differentially spliced transcripts to modulate innate immune responses, tissue energy homeostasis and the tissue matrix. we do not know under what stimuli either transcript is produced by cells of different lineages. we have shown that gene expression information generated in a non-model organism can be used to develop hypotheses that can be validated in more conventional systems. the validation of this approach enhances the intrinsic value of many existing datasets generated in a range of species as it provides a methodology for detailed analysis of fundamental biological phenomena, such as mitochondrial transcription and biogenesis. future work could aim to tease out whether one or more of the rnf <dig> protein isoforms are mitochondrially co-localised in addition to the mrna transcripts being mitochondrially co-expressed, and/or whether in vivo evidence can be detected for a role in immune function and mitochondrial transcription or biogenesis to supplement the in vitro data we have presented.
