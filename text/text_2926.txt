BACKGROUND
the clinical use of autologous platelet concentrates  for regenerative aims in veterinary medicine has focused on the field of equine medicine and surgery
 <cit> . to date, there are studies indicating the clinical utility of several types of pc in horses with musculoskeletal disease
 <cit>  and limb skin wounds
 <cit> . pc has also been evaluated as a coadjutant substance  in canine models of bone regeneration
 <cit>  and osseous integration
 <cit> .

the rationale for the use of pc stems from the fact that platelets  release substantial amounts of growth factors  and other molecules that modulate inflammation and tissue repair
 <cit> . platelets store at least  <dig> gfs directly implicated in wound healing and tissue homeostasis. however, transforming growth factor beta  <dig>  and platelet-derived growth factor type bb  are mainly contained in platelet alpha granules. these proteins are essential, among other biological actions, for extracellular matrix  deposition, angiogenesis and cell migration
 <cit> .

recently, a equine pc classification has been proposed for improving the knowledge on the kind of cells and growth factors  that are being used in horses with natural disease. briefly, liquid pc  could be classified in pure-platelet rich plasma  and leukocyte-platelet rich plasma . p-prp is characterized by a platelet count slightly higher  to the basal count of platelets in whole blood and the leukocyte count is lower than or similar to the leukocyte count in whole blood. on the other hand, l-prp has increased platelet  and leukocyte  counts when compared to whole blood
 <cit> .

either, p-prp or l-prp have been used clinically alone or after activation with several substances, such as calcium salts and thrombin , among others. calcium is an important second messenger in the platelet activation cascade because calcium mediates the characteristic platelet activation responses, such as shape change, granule secretion and aggregation
 <cit> . the activation of platelets by most stimulatory agents leads to an increase in the concentration of cytosolic calcium . platelet responses that are directly dependent on an increase in  include integrin activation, release of the second wave mediators, adp and thromboxane a <dig> , and the expression of platelet procoagulant activity mainly by the generation of thrombin
 <cit> .

thrombin is the most potent platelet activator. thrombin produces fibrin generation from fibrinogen and also contributes to the formation and consolidation of the hemostatic plug
 <cit> . this protein generates signaling cascades within the platelets by interacting with two membrane receptors coupled to g proteins belonging to the family of protease-activated receptors  and known as par <dig> and par4
 <cit> .

cats can develop various chronic musculoskeletal problems and suffer serious traumatic injuries
 <cit>  that may be susceptible to treatment with platelet concentrates, as happens with humans
 <cit>  and horses
 <cit> . pc could also be used as a coadjutant biomaterial in orthopedic surgery in cats
 <cit> . however, after reviewing the literature, we have not found any reports regarding the protocols for obtaining pc in cats for regenerative medicine purposes. we also did not find any published data about the concentration and temporal release of gf  from feline pc activated with calcium salts or thrombin.

the aims of this study were 1) to describe a manual method for producing two kinds of pc in cats, pc-a and pc-b, 2) to describe the cellular population of the pc obtained, 3) to measure and compare the effects of calcium gluconate  and bovine thrombin  on the temporal release of tgf-β <dig> and pdgf-bb from feline pc at  <dig> and  <dig> h post-activation and 4) to establish possible correlations between the cellular population present in the pc and the concentration of growth factors.

RESULTS

discussion
this research describes a simple centrifugation manual  protocol to obtain pc from feline blood, thereby concentrating the growth factors such as tgf-β <dig> and pdgf-bb for experimental or clinical application in this species. the protocol described here presents the advantage that the pc is easily obtained with one centrifugation step with a small volume of blood. this last situation is important in feline practice because the volume of blood required to obtain pc for clinical application could be a limiting factor, especially in pediatric patients. to note, both pc obtained in this study could be classified as p-prp.

we have not found any published studies about preparation of pc  for clinical use in cats for regenerative medicine purposes. however, we did find information regarding manual methods for concentrating feline platelets for evaluating in vitro the effect of aggregating and anti-platelet substances in this species. in those studies, sodium citrate  <dig> % was used as an anticoagulant. the studies included different centrifugation protocols ranging between 150– <dig> g and times of centrifugation ranging from 10– <dig> min
 <cit> . these studies did not present data on the number of platelets concentrated or other hematological information with respect to the characteristics of those pc. for this reason, this study presents novel information about feline hematology with potential applications of pc for regenerative medicine purposes in cats.

the cellular characteristics obtained in both pc differed only in the highest concentration of lym found in pc-a. this finding could suggest that each pc could display different biological effects mediated by this kind of cell when used clinically. this assumption can suggest a difference in clinical application characteristics of each portion due to the important regulatory effect of leukocytes in the healing process
 <cit> . particularly, lymphocytes are one major source of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interleukin- <dig> and tumor necrosis factor alpha. these proteins have functions related to wound healing because they increase the activity of neutrophils and monocytes and promote the proliferation of keratinocytes and fibroblasts. all these actions are important in the inflammatory phase of wound healing
 <cit> . however, this suggested mechanism is only an assumption, and additional experimental work is necessary to evaluate this hypothesis.

the platelet collection efficiency was low  in this study. this low efficiency is one of the main characteristics of manual methods  to concentrate platelets in humans
 <cit>  and horses
 <cit> . however, no other published results have been found for cats to compare with these results. the platelet collection efficiency obtained in this study could be sufficient  to produce biological effects because the high concentrations of platelets could suppress cell viability and proliferation
 <cit> . this concept is still controversial and should be the subject of future studies in cats. one limitation, with the platelet count of this study was that blood smears were not made to ensure no platelet clumping, this could be a potential limitation because clumping would influence the platelet counts.

the mpv represents the average size of the platelets, and pdw is an indicator of variation in the size of the platelets. the mpv and pdw values for automated hematology instruments would be increased during platelet activation
 <cit> . the mpv and pdw values were lower in whole blood that in either pc. however, these platelet activation related parameters remained in a normal rank in both pc
 <cit> . these values would indicate that the methodology used to obtain the pc in cats did not produce platelet activation. this concept is important if we consider that an effective method for concentrating platelets should first focus on obtaining functional and non-activated platelets instead of concentrating a large number of platelets
 <cit> . in the light of procoagulant properties of feline platelets, this statement must be interpreted with caution and could be a limitation of this study.

autologous platelet concentrate preparation involves a series of centrifugation and separation cycles for concentrating the platelets without inducing premature activation. the size and weight of the blood cells and the relative forces  and time of centrifugation are the factors that determine the cellular and molecular characteristics of a pc. studies in dogs
 <cit> , rabbits
 <cit> , pigs
 <cit> , horses
 <cit>  and humans
 <cit>  describe protocols with two rounds of centrifugation. one of these episodes is always greater than  <dig> g, and one of the centrifugation times is greater than  <dig> minutes . in the case of cats, the plt can be concentrated by a soft spin  and short time . this methodological difference between species to obtain pc may be due to the morphological characteristics of cat platelets, such as higher diameter 
 <cit>  and mean platelet volume 
 <cit> .

as described in a study in horses
 <cit> , samples were kept in incubation at room temperature  for two hours after activation. in our case , within two hours after activation, we did not yet have complete formation of a fibrin clot in most of the pc samples. for this reason, the cat samples were left in incubation for another hour . this difference in time required for the formation of fibrin clots can be due additionally to the peculiar morphology of the platelets of both species and to the cellular count of the pc and whole blood of each species. the platelet counts in whole blood and pc in horses
 <cit> , are lower than those found in the cats in the present study; in particular, the pc show three-fold higher platelet concentrations in cats than in horses. this high concentration of platelets in cat pc compared with the results reported in horses
 <cit>  can lead to longer incubation times and/or higher doses of activating substance to obtain clots in cat pc.

it is reported a tgf-β <dig> mean concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ng/ml in serum samples taken from  <dig> cats
 <cit> . this concentration was similar to the concentrations found in the supernatants of both pc but higher than the plasma tgf-β <dig> concentration in this study. this discrepancy was caused by premature platelet activation. serum differs from plasma in that the bulk of the fibrinogen has been removed by conversion into a fibrin clot together with the platelets that have either been physically bound in the fibrin matrix or activated to form aggregates or both
 <cit> . this finding implies previous blood clotting and therefore platelet activation and release of the growth factors contained in the platelet alpha granules, including tgf-β <dig> 

we were not able to find any reports on feline pdgf-bb plasma concentration. to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first time that an elisa human kit for pdgf-bb was used to measure this protein in blood components from cats. however, it is reported that both human and cat pdgf-bb presented high peptide sequence homology
 <cit> . a similar finding has also been noticed between human and equine pdgf-bb
 <cit> .

once the pc is prepared, platelet activation  may be important to maximize growth factor release. various substances have been described for the exogenous activation of pc, including thrombin
 <cit> , batroxobin
 <cit> , collagen type i
 <cit>  and calcium chloride
 <cit> , among others. the substances most frequently used to activate pc for clinical purposes are thrombin and calcium salts. the use of topical bovine thrombin has been reported in humans to cause the formation of antibodies against the coagulation factor v, prothrombin and thrombin
 <cit> . reports in mice show the formation of antibodies against autologous clotting factors and the induction of autoimmunity with features characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus, including antibodies against nuclear antigens, native dna, double-stranded dna and cardiolipin
 <cit> . for this reason, the clinical use of bovine thrombin as a platelet activator in feline medicine should be carefully studied. reports in humans
 <cit>  and horses
 <cit>  investigated the use of autologous thrombin obtained by the addition of calcium gluconate to the plasma. pc activation with autologous thrombin might provide another option for clinical practice in cats, and the probability of immunological reactions would be reasonably smaller. in addition, the results of this study reported that cg has an action comparatively equipotent to bt. these reasons suggest the use of cg to induce gelation of the pc for clinical purposes in cats.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the methodology presented in this report permits the concentration of platelets potentially suitable for clinical and experimental use in feline medicine. the presence of significantly higher amounts of growth factors in the supernatant of pc compared to plasma indicates that pc can be used as a source of growth factors. the presence of high numbers of lymphocytes in pc-a may indicate different clinical applications for each pc. the temporary release of the growth factors indicates that the bulk of the growth factors are released during the first  <dig> hours after pc activation. the lack of differences in growth factor concentrations indicates that for this concern, pc activation can be made with either calcium gluconate or thrombin. the clinical value of the data reported here requires further evaluation in clinical settings.
