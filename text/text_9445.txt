BACKGROUND
protein synthesis in all living cells involves the transcription of dna into messenger rna  and its subsequent translation into polypeptides. in prokaryotes, transcription and translation are physically and temporally linked, and each mrna molecule is translated by the ribosomes as it is transcribed. by contrast, in eukaryotes transcription and mrna processing are physically and temporally separated from translation by the nuclear membrane. this separation is hypothesized to have been a major factor in the emergence of the nuclear membrane  <cit> . as a result of the establishment of the nuclear membrane, the different rna species involved in protein synthesis such as mrnas, ribosomal rnas , and transfer rnas , need to be shuttled from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. the general model of rna export involves exportins as transport receptors that carry rna through the nuclear pore complex  in a rangtp-dependent manner  <cit> . in metazoa and fungi, the nuclear export of most rna species, such as micrornas , rrnas, small nuclear rnas , and trnas, has been shown to follow the rangtp-exportin model of transport, and specific exportins are involved with the different export pathways. however, nuclear export of most mrnas does not follow the rangtp-exportin pathway  <cit> . the mrna export machinery is highly integrated with mrna processing, and it includes a different set of nuclear transport adaptors plus other mrna binding proteins, rna helicases, and npc associated proteins  <cit> .

it is not known whether the proteins involved in the different rna export pathways are conserved among the different eukaryotic supergroups, and which components of the nucleocytoplasmic export of rna are traceable to the last eukaryotic common ancestor . the goal of this study was to explore the evolutionary history of the different rna export pathways across a diverse array of eukaryotes, with special emphasis on members of the supergroups excavata and chromalveolata, in order to identify lineage-specific innovations and make inferences regarding rna export evolution. to do so, we screened the genome of  <dig> species of eukaryotes to explore the presence of homologs of proteins involved in rna export in metazoa and fungi. results from our bioinformatic comparisons suggest that the basic components of the rangtp-dependent rna pathways are conserved across eukaryotes, whereas proteins involved in rangtp-independent mrna export are less conserved.

methods
data sources
we identified sixty four proteins from baker's yeast  experimentally shown to be involved in rna export and their putative human orthologs from ensembl , plus phax, a human protein involved in rna export that apparently lacks a yeast ortholog. for simplicity, proteins have been named according to their human ortholog when present, the full list of proteins used is provided in table s <dig> . using all the proteins previously identified to seed bionformatic searches, we interrogated the genomes of  <dig> eukaryotic species to identify their putative homologs. our initial set of species included representatives of five of the different eukaryotic supergroups . the genomes of most species were downloaded from the ncbi reference sequence  collection except where noted . the initial set included  <dig> or more representatives of the genera caenorhabditis, entamoeba, cryptosporidium, leishmania, plasmodium, and trypanosoma which provided taxonomic redundancy and served as consistency controls for our protocols.

a results for these species are available in the supplementary online material.

b the nucleomorph genomes of these species were included in the searches. despite the phylogenetic position of the hosts, they were members of placed close to plantae in the tables because of the algal origin of the nucleomorphs.

c the phylogenetic position of emiliana is still unclear .

bioinformatic searches
bioinformatic searches were locally performed using the blastp, psi-blast and tblastn algorithms  <cit> , part of the ncbi c++ toolkit  <cit> . in the case of blastp, we compared results obtained under three different matrices  and in the case of psi-blast we compared the results obtained for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> iterations. there were no major differences between the different search strategies implemented. thus, we report results for blastp with the blosum <dig> matrix in the manuscript. all results, including reciprocal best hit , also evaluated using blastp with the blosum <dig> matrix, are presented on tables s <dig> and s <dig> . results were then ranked into  <dig> categories  as described below. hits with e-values better than 10- <dig> were classified according to the following criteria: category  <dig> , a candidate homolog sequence  of similar length to the query protein sequence , showing a similarity of 60% or greater, and having a match that covers at least 80% of the qs; category  <dig> , a chs of similar length to the qs, similarity higher than 50%, and covering at least 60% of qs; category  <dig> , a chs of similar length to qs, with similarity higher than 40%, and covering at least 45% of qs; category  <dig> , a chs having 30% similarity or greater, and covering at least 30% of qs; and category  <dig> , a chs with e-value better than 10- <dig> that did not match any of the criteria above; candidates with e-value worse than 10- <dig> were not classified . in cases where human and yeast orthologs were present, results from the two queries were assessed together to ensure consistency. proteins in categories  <dig> and  <dig> were considered as strong homology candidates to the query sequences, proteins in category  <dig> were considered as potential homologs of the query sequences, proteins in categories  <dig> and  <dig> were considered as showing some local homologies due to sharing conserved domains. exemplary alignments for each category are provided in additional file  <dig>  tblastn only improved results by uncovering category  <dig> chs in cases where no chs had been identified, and the results are presented in table s <dig>  but are not discussed further. it is important to note that a negative result does not prove the absence of a particular protein homolog, it is just an indication that our protocols, based on sequence similarity, were not able to identify a homolog candidate.

reconstruction of rna export pathways in leca
our reconstruction of the different rna export pathways in the leca was based on a tree adapted from four recent reports that group the six eukaryotic supergroups into three separate megagroups  <cit> . the first megagroup includes opisthokonta and amoebozoa, the second one includes chromalveolata, plantae, and rhizaria, and the third one corresponds to excavata . despite significant advances in our understanding of eukaryotic phylogeny, no consensus has emerged regarding the placement of the root of the eukaryotic tree . to err on the side of caution, we have based our inferences on an unrooted tree , and set relatively stringent criteria in order to reconstruct the different rna export pathways in the leca. proteins inferred as likely to be present in the leca had to have matches in categories  <dig> or  <dig> in members of the three megagroups. for example, a protein with strong homology matches in opisthokonta or amoebozoa, strong homology matches in chromalveolata or plantae, and strong homology matches in excavata would be considered as likely to have already been present in the leca. in turn, proteins with matches in the top  <dig> categories in members of the three megagroups were inferred as probably present in the leca.

three additional sets of proteins were included for validation purposes. firstly, we included members of the saga transcription complex , which is specific of fungi lineages  <cit> . as an additional test, we included the proteins that make the u5snrnp spliceosomal complex as reported by collins and penny  <cit>  and checked that our results were consistent with those reported previously . finally, we compared our inferences with those of two previous studies that focused on the components of the npc  <cit> , and found that results are similar for all overlapping proteins, suggesting that the search protocols are comparable . importantly, our analysis broadened the number of proteins analyzed and cover a much wider portion of eukaryotic diversity.

RESULTS
in this study, we examined conservation of the proteins involved in rna export across eukaryotes. the different rna export pathways can be divided into two different groups. in opisthokonts, mirnas, rrnas, snrnas, and trnas are exported through rangtp-dependent pathways , whereas mrna export follows a rangtp-independent pathway . we examined conservation of the proteins involved in the different rna export pathways across eukaryotes, with special focus on distinguishing components that are traceable to the leca from those that derive from lineage-specific innovations. to facilitate the discussion, the different proteins were grouped according to the pathways they are involved with. in the case of proteins that are involved in more than one pathway, they were discussed in the context where their role appears to be better understood. thus, results for the tap-p <dig> heterodimer are discussed in the context of mrna export, although tap-p <dig> also plays a role in rrna export. we present results for the most representative proteins in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  and complete results for all species are available in tables s <dig> and s <dig> .

ran-gtp dependent rna export 
ran is a small, soluble gtpase present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of all eukaryotic cells that plays a critical role in rna export. exportins, the nuclear export transport receptors, bind nuclear cargo together with rangtp in the nucleus to form a ternary complex  that is translocated to the cytoplasm, where the complex subsequently dissociates upon hydrolysis of rangtp to release the cargo molecule. nuclear export of mirna, rrna, snrna, and trna has been shown to follow the rangtp-exportin model. bioinformatic searches showed that ran was well conserved in all species included in this study, with a ran chs in category  <dig>  in almost all genomes surveyed, and high levels of sequence conservation. the ran orthologs from human and trypanosoma brucei are  <dig> % identical/79% similar, whereas the s. cerevisae and t. brucei orthologs are  <dig> % identical/79% similar. the high conservation scores and phyletic distribution of ran chs indicate that the leca was highly likely to have possessed an ortholog of ran, and extends previous work that included fewer eukaryotic species in their analyses  <cit> .

ran binding protein  <dig> , another protein of the ran cycle, had a high level of conservation as well. ranbp <dig> stimulates rangtp hydrolysis by rangap  <cit> . because we found strong chs for ranbp <dig> in representatives of the three eukaryotic megagroups , it is likely that ranbp <dig> was present in the leca. experimental evidence showing that ranbp <dig> is involved in the ran cycle in the excavate leishmania major  <cit>  would suggest its function has been conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution.

rcc <dig>  and rangap  are responsible for the establishment of a rangtp-rangdp gradient across the nuclear envelope that drives rangtp dependent transport. these two proteins were less conserved than either ran or ranbp <dig> in our searches . rcc <dig> acts in the nucleus as the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and rangap acts in the cytoplasm and regulates the gtpase activity of ran. we only found chs for the human or yeast rcc <dig> and rangap orthologs in categories  <dig> and  <dig> in opisthokonts . because we found some chs in category  <dig> for rcc <dig> and rangap among plants, chromalveolates, and excavates, we infer that these two proteins were probably present in the leca .

the proteins involved in the ran cycle discussed above play role in intracellular transport of proteins and nucleic acids. their strong conservation across all species examined is in line with previous reports  <cit> . further, these results are consistent with the predictions of the evolutionary scenario presented by jékely  <cit> , where rangtp-dependent transport is strongly related to the origin of the nucleus. in addition to the proteins involved in the ran cycle, other export factors are required to provide specificity for the different rna export mechanisms. in the following sections we discuss conservation for the proteins that are specifically involved in the different rna export pathways.

microrna and trna export pathways
micrornas are short non-coding rnas involved in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells  <cit> , and trnas are non-coding rnas that transfer specific amino acids to a growing polypeptide chain. in the case of mirna and trna export, the exportins involved in the export of mirna precursors in human and yeast is exportin- <dig> , whereas xpot  is the one involved in trna export  <cit> .

there were no conservation scores better than  <dig> for yeast xpo <dig> other than its chs in yeast . conversely, conservation scores outside members of metazoa were  <dig> or worse in searches involving human xpo <dig>  these results agree with previous studies that had failed to find xpo <dig> homologs in members of euglenozoa and apicomplexa  <cit> . interestingly, several of the species that lack xpo <dig> homologs, such as t. brucei or trichomonas vaginalis, posses a functional mirna machinery  <cit> , suggesting that there are additional pathways for the export of mirna other than the one used in humans. a simple explanation for the complex phyletic distribution of xpo <dig> chs is difficult to reconcile with current eukaryotic phylogenies. there are known orthologs of xpo <dig> in plantae, and opisthokonta, and there are chs of score  <dig> in the three different megagroups, which would suggest that an xpo <dig> ortholog was probably present in the leca and would have been secondarily lost in several lineages. under alternative eukaryotic phylogenies  <cit>  the presence of orthologs in plants and opisthokonts would suggest that xpo <dig> was probably present in the leca, as previously suggested  <cit> .

in the case of xpot, chs for the yeast ortholog in category  <dig> were only found in fungi, whereas chs for the human ortholog in categories  <dig> and  <dig> were found among members of metazoa and amoebozoa, respectively . in addition, we found chs in category  <dig> or higher for the human xpot ortholog in members of opisthokonta, plantae, chromalveolata and excavata. although some of the chs in leishmania and trypanosoma  and plasmodium  are not strongly conserved, phylogenies show that they are true orthologs  <cit> . orthologs of xpot are involved in trna export in yeast and plants, but they are not an essential factor in some species. for example, nucleocytoplasmic export of trna is not fully blocked when the xpot gene is deleted in s. cerevisae, s. pombe and a. thaliana  <cit> . similar to xpo <dig>  orthologs of xpot are present in most of the major eukaryotic supergroups in this study, which would imply that the leca was likely to posses an ortholog of this gene.

xpo <dig> has also been postulated to play a minor role in trna export for some organisms. in this case, xpo <dig> mediates the trna transport in association to a ribosomal elongation factor named eef1a, tef <dig> in yeast  <cit> . this ribosomal elongation factor is also highly conserved, with chs in category  <dig> for most species in this study , once again, suggesting that it was likely present in the leca.

small nuclear rnas export pathway
small nuclear rnas are a group of non-coding transcripts involved in rna splicing, transcription factor regulation and telomere maintenance. the different snrnas are synthesized in the nucleus, assembled into snrnps in the cytoplasm and re-imported into the nucleus. export of snrnas presents some departures from the simpler model of exportin-rangtp-cargo seen in mirnas and trnas. in this case the exportin does not bind rna directly, and additional adaptor proteins are needed. exportin- <dig>  is the transport receptor in charge of carrying snrnas to the cytoplasm, in association to cbp <dig> , which binds to the snrna; cbp <dig> , which ensures high affinity binding; and phax, which provides the nuclear export signal  <cit> .

our analyses indicate that xpo <dig> is the most conserved exportin among the three included in our study . there were chs for human and yeast orthologs in categories  <dig> and  <dig> in most of eukaryotic lineages, and sequence conservation was also high. the human and t. brucei xpo <dig> orthologs were 32% identical/52% similar. in the case of cbp <dig> we found chs in categories  <dig> or  <dig> in all eukaryotic supergroups, whereas we failed to find chs of cbp <dig> in several species . by contrast, conservation scores for phax are either low, or below our detection threshold for all eukaryotes in this study other than members of metazoa, in agreement with a previous study  <cit> . these results indicate that the leca was likely to have xpo <dig> and cbp <dig> orthologs, but that phax appears to be a lineage-specific innovation. the case for cbp <dig> is more complex, there are some matches in category  <dig> in all eukaryotic megagroups, but no chs were identified in several species. we infer that cbp <dig> could have been present in the leca, but that it was either lost or diverged beyond our ability to detect it in several species.

rrna export pathway
ribosomes are made up of a combination of different rrnas and a large number of ribosomal proteins that are organized into the large  and small  pre-ribosomal subunits. in yeast, nuclear export of the pre-ribosomal subunits depends on xpo <dig> and rangtp  <cit> , and also involves additional proteins. in yeast, the nuclear export of the pre-60s ribosomal subunit requires the proteins nmd <dig>  arx <dig> and the mex67/mtr <dig> heterodimer, but export of 40s is poorly understood  <cit> . the role of nmd <dig>  arx <dig> and the mtr2/mex <dig> has not been completely elucidated yet. on the one hand, deletion of the arx <dig> gene leads to pre-60s accumulation in the nucleus  <cit> . on the other hand, a subsequent study from the same group shows that in the absence of arx <dig>  the addition of a nuclear export signal to the pre-60s subunit would be enough to restore its export  <cit> , which suggests that the export of pre-60s is relatively flexible.

xpo <dig> conservation scores have already been discussed with the other snrna export proteins. results for the two subunits of the general transport adapter,  are low  and will be discussed in the next section because of their major role in mrna export. the phyletic distribution of xpo <dig>  xpo <dig>  and xpo <dig> suggests that these exportins are involved with rna export in all the different eukaryotic supergroups analyzed, and also indicate that each of them is traceable to the leca. we observed that xpo <dig>  which is mostly involved in rrna export in opisthokonts, is the most conserved one, while xpot and xpo <dig>  involved in mirna, trna, snrna export, are not as conserved. even though orthologs of these exportins are found among excavates and chromalveolates, their role in these lineages is not fully understood. the little functional data available suggest that their roles are not entirely the same as in opisthokonts. for example, xpo <dig> has been shown to be involved with mrna export in the parasites of the genus trypanosoma  <cit> , but it is mostly involved with rrna export in opisthokonts. based on the functional data and their phyletic distribution, we speculate that there is some level redundancy in the functional role of the different exportins and propose that in the leca, xpo <dig> could have acted as the protein responsible for transport of most of the rnas through the npc.

for the additional rrna export proteins, our analyses show that nmd <dig> is well conserved in the vast majority of species included in this study , with 58% similarity/38% identity in comparisons between human and t. brucei orthologs. this would indicate that nmd <dig> is highly likely to have been present in the leca. by contrast some of the additional adaptors, such as arx <dig>  alb1p, and phax have few matches in category  <dig>  and seem to be lineage specific innovations. strong chs for arx <dig> are only found among fungi, strong chs for alb1p are restricted to yeasts in the subphylum saccharomycotina, whereas strong chs for phax are only found among animals.

as in the case with the exportins, the phyletic distribution of the transport adaptors discussed above suggests that these proteins are involved with export of trna, mirnas, snrnas and rrnas in all the different eukaryotic supergroups, and that they are traceable to the leca, such as nmd <dig>  which also appear to be conserved among the different eukaryotic supergroups. the specific combination of exportins and adaptors varies in a lineage-specific manner through a combination of gene gains and losses. for example, xpo <dig> has been secondarily lost in fruit fly, whereas xpot has been secondarily lost in c. elegans. on the other hand, we also found that arx <dig>  alb1p and phax are restricted to different groups within opisthokonta, suggesting that they are innovations specific to this group. these results would suggest that the specific export mechanism for the different rnas varies in a lineage-specific manner.

rangtp-independent transport: mrna export pathway 
in metazoa and fungi, nucleocytoplasmic export of the majority of the mrnas does not follow the rangtp-dependent exportin pathway. from yeast to humans, mrnas associate with protein factors into messenger rnps  which are then exported through the npc by an essential shuttling heterodimer, tap/p <dig> in human and mex67/mtr <dig> in yeast, which functions as a general mrna export receptor to transport mrnps through the npcs  <cit> . the dimeric export receptor operates in association with trex , a multiprotein complex that connects transcription with mrna export  <cit> . human trex consists of the rna helicase uap <dig> , the rna-binding adaptor protein aly  and the tho complex  <cit> . in yeast, an additional complex named trex- <dig>  consisting of thp <dig>  sac <dig>  sus <dig>  and cdc <dig> is also capable of mediating the nuclear export of mrnps in concert with mex67/mtr <dig>  <cit> .

our analyses indicate that few of the proteins involved in the mrna export pathway are conserved across all eukaryotes. this is perhaps not unexpected given the differences in mrna processing among eukaryotes. in the case of the tap or mex <dig> subunit of the heterodimer, conservation scores outside fungi and metazoa were  <dig> or  <dig> with the exception of some excavata members. whereas bioinformatic searches for the yeast mtr <dig> subunit only identified strong chs in fungi. this is not a surprising result, as similarities between mtr <dig> and its human functional analog, p <dig>  are restricted to three-dimensional structure  <cit> , which cannot be detected by sequence similarity analyses. in the case of trex, the uap <dig> subunit  is well conserved across all eukaryotes: we have strong chs for the yeast ortholog in all species in this study except for emiliana huxleyi. the thoc <dig> subunit, tex <dig> in yeast , has good chs among opisthokonts and plants, and moderate candidates in amebozoa, chromalveolata, and excavata. by contrast, we could not identify chs for the yeast yra <dig>  in several chromalveolata and excavata. a similar situation is observed for the trex- <dig> complex, where only cetn <dig>  cdc <dig> in yeast , is well conserved across all eukaryotes. cetn <dig> is a centrin involved in the duplication and segregation of the centrosome during cytokinesis that is also involved in mrna export in yeast  <cit> . however, evidence for a role of cetn <dig> in mrna export in some members of excavata is lacking, as it is only required for the initiation of cytokinesis in leishmania and t. brucei  <cit> .

the cellular fate of the different mrnas depends mainly on the shuttle proteins tap/p <dig>  yra <dig>  rae <dig> and gle <dig>  ddx <dig>  which are also required for proper translation  <cit> . rae <dig> acts in delivering tap to the npc  <cit>  and ddx <dig> is responsible for triggering the mrnps remodeling at the npc cytoplasmic-face scaffold, delivering the mrna to the cytoplasm  <cit> . both rae <dig> and ddx <dig> are well conserved, with chs in categories  <dig> and  <dig> for all the supergroups. however, the adaptor protein gle <dig>  that plays an important role in the control of mrna export in yeast  <cit> , appears to be missing from amoebozoa, plantae, chromalveolata, and excavata, suggesting it is an innovation specific to opisthokonta.

the proteins involved in the rangtp-independent export of mrna are generally less conserved than those involved in rangtp-dependent export of all other rna species. some of the major components of the mrna export pathway are conserved across the different eukaryotic supergroups examined. this is the case for uap <dig>  ddx <dig>  and rae <dig>  however, there are many proteins that play essential roles in mrna export in opisthokonts that lack strong chs outside this group, and appear to represent opisthokont-specific innovations. this group includes mlp <dig>  mlp <dig>  and the shuttling proteins tap, yra <dig>  nab <dig>  and gbp <dig>  these results suggest that mrna export in members of the other supergroups might follow slightly different mechanisms. one possibility is that mrna export might also follow a rangtp-dependent pathway. interestingly, the fact that in the excavate trypanosoma the xpo <dig> ortholog is involved in mrna export  <cit>  is consistent with our inference. we speculate that mrna might have been exported by xpo <dig> in a rangtp-dependent manner early in eukaryote evolution, and that it later followed more specialized pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
results from our genomic comparisons indicate that several of the key proteins involved in the different rangtp-dependent rna export pathways are conserved across most eukaryotic lineages, and thus we infer that orthologs of them were highly likely to have been already present in the leca. examples of these are the exportins xpo <dig> and xpot, nmd <dig> and most of the proteins involved in the ran cycle. despite the relatively strong level of conservation, we also document how these export mechanisms vary in a lineage-specific manner as a consequence of the differential gene gains and losses, as documented by the secondary loss of xpot in c. elegans, and the emergence of arx <dig> in fungi and of phax in animals. in agreement with inferences drawn from studies of components of the cytoskeleton, endomembrane, npc, and spliceosome  <cit>  a number of key rna nucleocytoplasmic transport factors can be traced to the leca. this would suggest that the different rangtp-dependent rna export mechanisms were already present in the leca.

by contrast, our analyses indicate that several of the proteins involved in the rangtp-independent export pathway from opisthokonts are lineage-specific innovations. the mrna export pathway is the most complex and the least conserved among those examined in this study. we found chs for few of the yeast proteins involved in mrna export in most eukaryotic lineages, which suggests that mrna export among them is different from what is observed in yeast. we document the acquisition of several lineage-specific innovations in the mrna export mechanisms of opisthokonts relative to the other supergroups included in this study. it seems plausible that the evolution of a rangtp-independent mrna export pathway in opisthokonts might be related to the observed differences in the regulation of gene expression. in amoebozoa, chromalveolata and excavata, most regulation is post-transcriptional  <cit> , whereas in human and yeast the presence of both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation is linked to a more refined control of gene expression. one possibility is that having an mrna export pathway fully separated from the other rna export pathways increases of the range possibilities of gene-specific control. this would be particularly important to allow both coordination and versatility in gene expression control  <cit> , as well as to open additional opportunities to connect active transcriptional sites to the npc, allowing a fine control of gene expression in yeast and human  <cit> . functional data regarding mrna export in excavates and chromalveolates is still limited, and despite the fact that some studies suggest if follows less complex routes  <cit> , the possibility that alternative specializations haven arisen in these groups cannot be discarded.

taken together, our analyses suggest that the leca possessed most of the basic components of the different rangtp-dependent rna export mechanisms, which are also well conserved among the different eukaryote supergroups included in this study. in addition, we also show that some of the major components of the rangtp-independent mrna export pathways can also be traced to the leca, but that several of the proteins that play key roles in opisthokonts derive from lineage-specific innovations. it is likely that early in eukaryote evolution a single generalized ancestral exportin was probably responsible for nucleocytoplasmic transport of all rna species . prior to the emergence of the leca, orthologs of xpo <dig>  xpo <dig>  and xpot would have already emerged and specialized in transporting a subset of the rnas . we speculate that in the leca mrna might have been exported by xpo <dig> in rangtp-dependent manner, as in excavates in the genus trypanosoma. the emergence of the rangtp-independent mrna export pathway in opisthokonts coincides with the origin of several lineage-specific innovations, and might be related to refinements in the regulation of gene expression in this supergroup .
