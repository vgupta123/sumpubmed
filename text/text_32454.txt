BACKGROUND
psoriasis is a chronic t-cell-mediated inflammatory disease that affects approximately 2% of the world population 
 <cit> . histologically, it is characterized by the infiltration of active immune cells into the skin, the hyperplasia of blood vessels and the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes. the leukocyte infiltrate in psoriasis lesions is composed mainly by t cells, predominantly cd4 + -type cells but also cd8 + -type t cells 
 <cit> . t cells are known to expand and migrate into the epidermis before the onset of the first epidermal changes, and steadily continue to do so, promoting and perpetuating the disease 
 <cit> .

the central role of t cells in psoriasis pathogenesis was first evidenced in the late 70s, when the t cell suppressor cyclosporine a was discovered as an effective treatment for psoriasis inflammation 
 <cit> . in the 90′s elegant studies using skin xenografts of with non-lesional skin from patients with psoriasis showed the conversion to psoriatic plaques when mice were injected with preactivated t cells from the same patient 
 <cit> . since then, a substantial amount evidence supporting the key role for t cells, mainly type  <dig> t helper subtype , has been accumulated 
. more recently, il <dig> and il <dig> producing t lymphocytes  have been characterized as critical mediators of psoriasis pathogenesis 
. however, the triggering events and deregulated pathways that lead to the aberrant t cell activation in psoriasis patients are still poorly defined. in the present study we aimed to increase the knowledge on this particular aspect of psoriasis etiology by characterizing the t cell gene expression profile associated with psoriasis during t cell activation.

to date, psoriasis has been investigated by a number of whole genome gene expression studies. these have been mainly conducted with skin biopsy samples, through the comparison of lesional and non-lesional skin. gene expression analysis in biopsies from skin lesions is of great interest in psoriasis and has produced several important findings 
. however, one limitation of this approach is that the mixture of the different cell types that coexist in the skin tissue is likely to mask relevant gene expression patterns. specially, if the cell type of interest is not the predominant component of the total tissue extract, as in the case of infiltrating t cells in lesional skin, the resulting gene expression data could not be informative.

an alternative to skin biopsy analysis has been the analysis of gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  from patients and controls 
. this approach is of particularly interest in immune-mediated diseases like psoriasis, since it is a less invasive approach and, consequently, predictive profiles can have a better translation into the clinical setting. however, most t cells circulating in the peripheral blood are in a quiescent state 
 <cit> , with scarce gene expression activity 
 <cit> . consequently, relevant pathogenic processes like t cell activation might not well be studied through this approach.

in the present study we have used in vitro activated t cells from patients and healthy controls to characterize the gene expression profile associated with psoriasis. using an independent cohort of patients and controls we have validated the most significant genes associated with this differential regulatory activity. finally, using different genomic approaches we have characterized the gene expression networks and biological pathways that characterize this key aspect of psoriasis biology.

RESULTS
gene expression profiles from in vitro activated t cells were obtained from  <dig> psoriasis patients and  <dig> healthy controls using illumina ht- <dig> v <dig> microarrays. from each individual gender, age was collected, and psoriasis area and severity index  score was determined for each patient at the time of sample collection . there were no statistically significant differences  in age or gender between the microarray and validation case control samples. also, the pasi score was not significantly different between discovery and validation patient samples. from each rna sample, a total of  <dig>  transcripts were quantified and  <dig>  probes were called as expressed in the sample  according to the illumina expression score and selected for statistical analysis.

differentially expressed genes in in vitro activated t cells
a total of  <dig> genes were found to be significantly associated with psoriasis . from these,  <dig> were found to be up-regulated in t cells from psoriasis patients and  <dig> genes were down-regulated in patients compared to controls. the genes with fdr p-value <  <dig>  showing the largest change in gene expression  are shown in table

identification of spat2sl and klf <dig> coexpression networks
since spat2sl and klf <dig> have not been previously associated to the t lymphocyte activation process, we aimed to identify and analyze the gene expression network associated to each of the two genes. for this objective we used the weighted correlation analysis implemented in the wgcna method 
 <cit> . after filtering for the most informative genes , we identified a total of  <dig> different gene expression modules . using the eigenvectors derived from each gene expression module we evaluated the association to different clinical and epidemiological variables . from these, we found four modules significantly associated with the presence of psoriasis . these four modules were not associated with any of the other tested covariates. the first of these modules  included  <dig> genes and was the most enriched in genes differentially expressed between psoriasis cases and controls . the second module  consisted in  <dig> genes from which 37% were differentially expressed. the third module  included  <dig> genes and 29% from them showed differential expression. finally, the fourth module  included a total of  <dig> genes, but with a lower percentage showing differential expression between cases and controls .

spats2l was found to belong to m <dig> gene expression module, while klf <dig> was found to be coexpressed with genes in module m <dig>  the fourth module associated with psoriasis, m <dig>  included the genome-wide significant rora gene that could not be technically validated by rtpcr.

gene set enrichment analysis of the t cell transcriptome
in order to further investigate the biological basis of the gene expression differences observed between t cells from psoriasis patients and controls, we analyzed the global transcriptome using the gsea approach

the top gene sets identified using gsea encoded for cytokine signalling-related genes, more specifically, for genes associated with alpha/beta and gamma interferon signalling. consistent with this strong interferon response, a group of gene sets related to innate immune system  and rig and nod-like receptor pathways  were also among the most significantly enriched.

t cell activation in psoriasis patients also resulted in a significant enrichment of genes involved in pparα-mediated activation of gene expression  and cholesterol biosynthesis . cholesterol biosynthesis was also the most significant go biological process associated with klf <dig> coexpression network. finally, protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulm was also a common pathway detected by gsea  and in the go analysis of klf <dig> network.

discussion
it is widely accepted that psoriasis is a t-cell mediated disease, in which lymphocytes continuously infiltrate the skin promoting and perpetuating inflammation. however, little is known yet on the gene expression regulation that characterizes t cell activation in psoriasis. most of the whole genome gene expression studies in psoriasis performed to date have been principally been conducted in skin, where the t cell-associated gene expression is obscured by other more predominant cell types like hyperproliferative keratinocytes. alternatively, in gene expression studies using freshly isolated blood lymphocytes, most t cells are found in a quiescent state and might not reflect gene expression profiles relevant to the disease. in the present study, we aimed to overcome these limitations by characterizing the differential gene expression profile of in vitro activated t cells in psoriasis patients and controls. to our knowledge, it is the first study to analyze t cell activation in psoriasis using whole-genome gene expression analysis.

in the microarray analysis of in vitro activated t cells we were able to identify  <dig> genes differentially expressed between psoriasis patients and controls. using an independent sample of patients and controls we validated the association of the two genes most highly overexpressed in psoriasis t cells, spats2l and klf <dig>  it is the first time that spats2l and klf <dig> genes have been associated with the t cell activation process in psoriasis.

to date, little is known on the biological functionality of spats2l. in our study, combining gene coexpression network analysis and gene ontology enrichment we found that spats2l gene network is associated to processes associated with the activation of gene expression including chromosomal organization and ribosomal biogenesis. this potential association of spats2l with ribosomal processes and translational control has been previously described in gene-trap experiments conducted in myoblasts under oxidative stress 
 <cit> . ribosomal biogenesis has been proved to be critical in the control of cell growth and cell proliferation 
 <cit> , and in t cells, is one of the most significantly up-regulated cellular processes during cell-cycle entry 
 <cit> . therefore, the overexpression of spats2l in activated t cells from psoriasis patients could be contributing to an earlier activation of these lymphocytes compared to healthy controls.

consistently with this potential role in altered cell activation, there is evidence that spats2l is associated with lymphoproliferative-type of disorders. analyzing the overexpression of spats2l in different human diseases, we found that spats2l is one of the genes most significantly overexpressed in lymphocytes from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia  compared to cells from normal controls  
 <cit> . also, spats2l is found to be significantly overexpressed in a mouse model of t-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia  
 <cit> . furthermore, gene expression data from leukemia cell lines treated with anti-leukemic agent imatinib, shows a significant downregulation of spats2l . finally, a recent genome-wide association study  data on risk loci for lymphoblastic leukemia has shown a significant association of a single nucleotide polymorphism in the spats2l locus 
 <cit> . together, these results show that spats2l functionality is strongly associated with the aberrant activation of lymphocytes.

interestingly, there is evidence that psoriasis and lymphoproliferative disorders could share common genetic basis. patients with psoriasis have an increased risk of developing leukemia, in particular lymphoma 
 <cit> . in a gwas performed in follicular lymphoma, the region with most significant association was located near the psoriasis susceptibility region  <dig>  in chromosome  <dig> 
 <cit> . furthermore, a fairly common manifestation of certain leukemias, including lymphocytic leukemias, is the infiltration of neoplastic leukocytes in skin tissue, also known as leukemia cutis 
 <cit> . therefore, it is tempting to speculate that spats2l is involved in a common genetic pathway associated with psoriasis and lymphoproliferative-type of disorders. this pathway would therefore participate in the aberrant lymphocyte activity observed in both diseases and the preferential infiltration of skin tissue by these altered lymphocytes.

klf <dig> encodes a member of kruppel family of transcription factors 
 <cit> , several of which have been previously implicated in t lymphocyte biology 
 <cit> . klf <dig> has been previously shown to be expressed in lymphoid cells 
 <cit>  and, similarly to spats2l, there is also evidence of differential expression of klf <dig> in t cells from cll patients compared to controls 
 <cit> . compared to spats2l however, klf <dig> coexpression network showed a highly significant gene ontology enrichment, mainly in ontologies related to the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins. these biosynthetic processes are induced in cells that are stimulated to rapidly grow and proliferate, as it is the case of activated t cells 
. two other significant biological processes enriched in the klf <dig> network were endoplasmic reticulum stress and biosynthesis of hydrogen sulfide. these processes are linked to another process also found to be enriched by psoriasis in gsea analysis which is the unfolded protein response  
 <cit> . interestingly, the expression of klf <dig> and other klf members has been previously reported to be up-regulated when upr is induced by different drugs, such as tunicamycin 
 <cit>  or thapsigargin  
 <cit> . on the basis of this information, it is possible that in t cells from psoriasis patients, klf <dig> up-regulation may also be induced by an upr, in this case, triggered by the increase in protein-folding load required upon t cell activation.

we have investigated the biological processes that take place during t cell activation associated with psoriasis using both an unsupervised approach which does not use sample information, wgcna, as well as a supervised approach, gsea, which compares gene sets overrepresented in cases compared to controls. even though these are clearly different functional analysis, they resulted in the identification of common biological processes. one of these common biological processes was the biosynthesis of lipids and proteins. for example, cholesterol biosynthesis was the most significantly enriched process in klf <dig> coexpression network and was also detected by gsea as one of the most enriched processes in t cells from psoriasis patients. this enrichment in genes involved in biosynthetic processes could be attributed to an early activation of t cells from psoriasis patients. another common biological pathway identified in both approaches was the endoplasmic reticulum stress and unfolded protein response. interestingly, these two processes, which may result from the increased protein-folding load required in activated t cells, have been associated with a number of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases like spondyloarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel diseases or multiple sclerosis 
.

the most significantly enriched gene sets identified by gsea were, however, related to cytokine signalling , more specifically, to genes involved in the interferon signalling pathway . this result is fully consistent with the strong interferon-signature detected in psoriasis skin lesions 
 <cit> . in line with this observation, gsea results also show evidence of an association with il12-stat <dig> pathway, an interferon gamma inducing pathway, although at much lower significance. ifn has been shown to drive activation and differentiation of il <dig> and il <dig> producing t cells 
 <cit> , and to increase keratinocyte responsiveness to il <dig> which leads to the observed hyperproliferation 
 <cit> . in line with these observations, gsea analysis also identified an enrichment of innate immune sensing mechanisms related to the production of ifn like rig-i receptor signaling pathway  
 <cit>  and the nlr family of receptors like nod <dig> 
 <cit>  . together, these results suggest that ifn response pathway is more strongly activated in t cells from psoriasis patients than normal healthy controls.

the four t cell gene networks associated with psoriasis risk identified through wgcna analysis were found to be highly enriched for genes associated to the response to virus biological process . a total of  <dig> genes  out of  <dig> overexpressed by t cells  were associated to the response to a viral infection. this result is in accordance with the recent evidence implicating an increased antiviral activity in psoriatic skin compared to skin from normal controls or patients with atopic dermatitits 
 <cit> . in this model, keratinocytes are rendered hyperresponsive towards an antiviral response after being conditioned from t helper  <dig>  cell-type cytokines.

in the last years the two newly characterized t-cell subsets, th <dig> and th <dig>  have been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. while our approach does not provide direct evidence of an increase of either cell subset, it describes an increased activation of precursor cells in affected individuals. it is therefore likely that this differential activity predisposes to these two particular cell types once in the skin microenvironment of psoriasis patients. additional studies will be needed to confirm this hypothesis. another limitation of our study is that we analyzed the global expression changes of all activated t cells, regardless of the specific subphenotype. while we found no statistically significant differences in cd4+ or cd8+ percentages in cases compared to controls , it is possible that specific subphenotypes are differently represented between the two groups. therefore, future studies will be performed to identify which cell subtype/s are responsible for each of the differentially expressed genes and genetic pathways associated with psoriasis in our study.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have investigated for the first time the gene expression profile specifically associated with t cell activation in psoriasis. we have identified spats2l and klf <dig> as the two genes most significantly overexpressed in activated t cells from psoriasis patients and we have validated this overexpression in an independent case-control cohort. functional analysis of the gene coexpression networks, suggest that spats2l and klf <dig> might be involved in an early activation process. global functional enrichment also shows a strong prevalence of interferon cytokine mediated signalling in activated t cells from psoriasis compared to controls. the results of this study associate new biological pathways with psoriasis etiology and establish new lines of research that will clearly lead to an improved knowledge of the biological basis of this disease and, hopefully, to improved therapies in the near future.
