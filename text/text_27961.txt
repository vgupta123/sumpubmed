BACKGROUND
plants, because of their sessile lifestyle, have evolved adaptations to live under diverse environmental variables, including solar radiation. sunlight contains qualities of light that are essential for photosynthesis, and also provides informational signals that control plant growth and development. at least three different types of photoreceptor systems exist in plant cells, perceiving red/far-red , blue/uv-a , and there is at least one putative uv-b receptor , which was recently identified
 <cit> .

uv-b  is part of the solar radiation, and therefore plants are inevitably exposed to uv-b. uv photons cause cellular damage by generating dna photoproducts and through direct damage to proteins, lipids, and rna
 <cit> . plant responses to uv-b damage include repair
 <cit>  and avoidance
 <cit> . solar uv-b radiation flux varies over time and location on earth. it is higher at increased elevation, because there is less air mass and greater atmospheric transparency to shorter wavelength radiation, although local climatic conditions, such as cloud cover, can modulate the dosage
 <cit> . uv-b increases are most critical in specific ecosystems, for example, ozone depletion was extensive at a 3420-m site in the andes mountains compared with values from equal latitude to the west and east
 <cit> . consequently, determining the molecular bases for acclimation to higher uv-b fluence is an important factor in sustaining crop yield as the world’s population continues to increase.

because plants living at high altitudes are typically exposed to elevated uv-b, they are predicted to have mechanisms to prevent damage from this radiation, such as the accumulation of uv-absorbing compounds
 <cit>  and the use of uv-a photons by photolyase enzymes to repair most uv-b induced dna damage
 <cit> . the plant epidermis, by virtue of the accumulation of numerous phenolic compounds and cuticular waxes, absorbs 90–99% of solar uv-b radiation. in many flowering plants, flavonoids accumulate in the vacuoles of epidermal cells where they attenuate the uv component of sunlight with minimal absorption of photosynthetically active radiation
 <cit> .

the p <dig> gene encodes an r2r3-myb transcription factor that regulates the accumulation of a specific group of flavonoids in maize floral tissues, the flavones and the phlobaphenes
 <cit> . p <dig> controls the accumulation of these pigments by activating a subset of maize flavonoid biosynthetic genes
 <cit>  and is primarily expressed in floral tissues, including the pericarp, cob glumes, silks and husk tissues. the phlobaphene pigments have been historically used as markers to uncover some of the fundaments of modern genetics. among the compounds controlled by p <dig> are the flavones, important phytochemicals that provide protection against a number of maize pathogens, furnish a powerful uv shield and are significant nutraceutical components of the human diet
 <cit> . previously, we established that some maize landraces, specifically those adapted to high altitudes, accumulate flavones and express p <dig> in leaves and other green tissues in the presence of uv-b, in sharp departure to the floral-organ specific expression domain of p <dig> found in most other maize inbred lines
 <cit> . these results suggest the potential for a large p <dig> allelic diversity as a consequence of growing in diverse environments.

an important challenge is to define the molecular bases that permit acclimation responses of maize to uv-b. maize races have a complex history, having been derived from multiple open pollinated varieties and transported by people to diverse locations
 <cit> . maize genotypes exhibit immense allelic diversity, and this represents a fundamental resource for both genetics and breeding. this crop requires a high light environment for good yield
 <cit> , and it is safe therefore to assume that indigenous farmers would grow high-altitude maize in sunny locations. therefore, these indigenous landraces are predicted to have improved uv-b tolerance, reflecting recurrent selection against visible symptoms of uv-b stress.

in this study, we analyzed whether the expansion in the expression domain of p <dig> in specific maize landraces that have adapted to high altitude  can be associated to changes in the molecular structure of the corresponding p <dig> alleles, in particular, changes in cis-regulatory elements sequences in promoter regions that allow as-yet to be identified regulators to activate p <dig> expression in vegetative tissues. to gain insight of the participation of this transcription factor in uv-b regulated synthesis of flavones in maize leaves, we first studied the regulation of p <dig> by uv-b in maize leaves of five maize landraces from high altitudes: three from mexico  and two from the andes mountains . we then analyzed the molecular structure of the p <dig> promoter alleles in these landraces, and investigated which regulatory motifs may be responsible of the regulation of p <dig> by uv-b. finally, to study if the different expression patterns of p <dig> in the high altitude landraces can be attributed to the presence of trans- or cis-acting elements in the landraces, transient expression analysis using leaf protoplasts from w <dig> and mishca, and proximal promoter constructs fused to the luciferase gene reporter were analyzed.

RESULTS
p <dig> is expressed in maize leaves and is induced by uv-b in maize high altitude landraces
previously, northern blot analysis using a complete p <dig> cdna as a probe identified a transcript induced by uv-b radiation in leaves of high-altitude maize plants, with no signal in mrnas from w <dig> leaves
 <cit> . until then, no p <dig> alleles had been reported to be expressed in maize leaves. by the nature of the experiment, however, it is possible that this long probe could have hybridized not only to p <dig>  but also to any other transcripts harboring similarity to p <dig>  for example, p <dig> is a myb-like transcriptional activator
 <cit> ; it is possible that the probe used can recognize transcripts for another myb regulator. to rule out this possibility, to detect the very low abundance of p <dig> transcripts in leaves, and to analyze p <dig> regulation by uv-b in the different genetic backgrounds, here we analyzed the expression of p <dig> in landraces and inbred lines leaves subjected to uv-b radiation treatments using nested rt-pcr, a significantly more specific and sensitive technique. p <dig> expression level was measured in young leaves of five different maize high-altitude landraces and in one low altitude line, w <dig> . after  <dig> hours of uv-b, an important increase in p <dig> transcript levels was measured in the five landraces when compared with levels in plants under control conditions in the absence of uv-b, which were almost undetectable under this condition . in contrast, the w <dig> inbred line showed very low and similar p <dig> transcript levels under both conditions. 

furthermore, p <dig> protein levels were analyzed by western blots, using polyclonal antibodies against p1
 <cit> , in nuclear extracts from leaves of a low altitude inbred line  and the five landraces, under control and uv-b conditions. the densitometric quantification of the western blots showed increases of p <dig> protein levels in the high altitude landraces  after the uv-b treatment . consistent with the rt-pcr results , w <dig> did not show changes in p <dig> levels after irradiation with supplemental uv-b . thus, mrna changes by uv-b parallels the protein changes measured. it is interesting that, despite the low levels of p <dig> transcript measured in leaves, in some cases almost undetectable as determined by nested rt-pcr, it was possible to distinguish the presence of the protein in nuclear extracts in all samples at different levels.

uv-b increases the binding of p <dig> to the chs promoter in high altitude landraces
an 8 h-long uv-b-treatment can induce the expression of enzymes of the flavonoid pathway in maize, including chalcone synthase 
 <cit> . maize has two chs genes, c <dig> and whp
 <cit> . thus, we analyzed the association of p <dig> to the promoter region of c <dig> in one high-altitude landrace, confite puneño , and in the w <dig> low altitude line under control conditions  and after an 8 h uv-b treatment.

chromatin immunoprecipitation  analyses were done using the polyclonal antibodies against p1
 <cit>  using control and uv-b treated samples from confite and w <dig> maize leaves, and enrichment after immunoprecipitation was analyzed by pcr using primers specific for the c <dig> promoter region . to evaluate nonspecific binding, the pcr reaction was done with samples incubated without an antibody; all chiped samples were also analyzed in parallel with total dna from sonicated nuclei to evaluate the selective recovery of gene segments. the percentage of dna recovered relative to the dna input when experiments were done in the absence of antibodies was always lower than 5% of the dna recovered when specific antibodies were used . after the uv-b treatment, c <dig> promoter sequences in confite plants were increased in the fractions immunoprecipitated with αp1; in contrast, similar levels of immunoprecipitate were measured in w <dig> samples with or without the uv-b treatment . no enrichment was detected after the uv-b treatment in the control without antibody  for either confite or w <dig> samples. therefore, there is a considerable increase in p <dig> binding to the chs promoter region of confite plants exposed under uv-b light, and this change does not occur in the inbred line w <dig> . from these results, we propose that the increased expression of p <dig> in cft and other high-altitude races results in p <dig> regulating c <dig> expression during uv-b exposure in leaves of the maize landrace confite. a similar mechanism is likely involved in the regulation of the expression of other genes encoding flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes. 

variable p <dig> copy number in maize landraces
the number of p <dig> copies varies depending on the maize genotype. to investigate the nature of the p <dig> allele in the high altitude maize landraces, we determined the copy number of the different alleles of the high altitude landraces by quantitative pcr
 <cit> . genomic dna from the single copy p1-rr allele was used as a reference, and the p1-wr cluster from b <dig> as an example of the multi-copy p <dig> allele. the primers used are specific for p <dig>  and do not hybridize on the p <dig> gene, an ortholog of p <dig> that is not involved in phlobaphene pigmentation
 <cit> . figure 
3a shows the different high altitude landraces, inbred line b <dig> and p1-rr kernels at the same magnification, presenting different color or colorless of the pericarp and the stalk corresponding with the color of the cobs from which genomic dna was extracted to analyze the p <dig> copy number. 
1: figure s1b. all measurements were done in triplicate using biological replicates.

figure 
3b shows that arrocillo has only  <dig> copy of the p <dig> gene, cacahuacintle has  <dig> copies, confite has  <dig>  conico has  <dig> and mishca has  <dig> copies of the p <dig> gene. on the other hand, our assays show that b <dig> has  <dig> p <dig> copies , which is close to the eleven copies of p <dig> reported by sequencing different bac clones from this inbred line by goettel and messing
 <cit> . our results show that the landraces under study have a variable number of p <dig> copies, suggesting that the uv-b regulation of this gene in the landraces in vegetative tissues is unlikely to be linked to the structure of the p <dig> cluster.

analysis of p <dig> promoters from maize lines and landraces
because we found that high altitude landraces show p <dig> induction by uv-b, and higher expression in leaves compared to the low altitude lines b <dig> and w <dig>  we then cloned and compared p <dig> promoter sequences from the different landraces to analyze the presence of putative regulatory sequences that may be responsible for the differential patterns of expression. these sequences include a distal enhancer and the proximal promoter located between − <dig> to − <dig> and − <dig> to + <dig>  respectively; and the 1st intron region. the dna sequence of the p <dig> promoter  from different alleles, including p1-wr and p1-rr, was previously reported.

we first cloned and analyzed promoter regions which cover ~ <dig> kbp upstream the p <dig> transcription start site, and which include the basal promoter and part of the proximal enhancer described
 <cit>  from four of the high altitude landraces . for comparison, we included in our analysis promoter regions from b <dig> and w <dig> lines. we obtained two clones with distinct promoter sequences from confite and mishca, and one from arrocillo and cacahuacintle, a good correlation, but not the complete set, of the copy number present in the genome . it is however possible that the different copies might be identical in the regions analyzed, or that the primers used to amplify the promoter regions may not hybridize with all the different copies in each landrace.

when the proximal promoter sequences of all lines was compared, a total of  <dig> indels were identified in this ~ <dig> kbp region, with single-nucleotide indels accounting for more than half , followed by two nucleotide indels . thus, more than 68% of all the indels identified were less than 2 bps in length. moreover, in the middle region of 783 bps sequence analyzed ; there are no indels longer than 2 bps.

it is interesting to note that there is also a relatively high frequency of indels ≥  <dig> bases, that include four indels of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 36 bps in length located in the region extending from − <dig> to + <dig> ; and a 15 bps indel is located at − <dig>  with exception of the 19 bps indel, these long indels are multiples of 3 bps. the 36 bps insertion is exclusively present in the b <dig> line; the 24 bps insertion is absent in mishca; the 19 bps insertion is absent in b <dig> and cacahuacintle, and the 18 bps insertion is absent only in cacahuacintle. the 15 bps indel, positioned at −1084 bps , is absent in w <dig>  arrocillo, and confite. the sequences included in these long indels do not have any characterized box linked to uv-b or light response elements described in other promoters
 <cit> . however, the absence or presence of these indels could affect the relative distance of cis-regulatory element to others boxes, which may be involved not only in response to light but also in the modulation of p <dig> expression levels.

the high indel frequency observed in maize, and specifically in the cloned promoter regions of the landraces analyzed, may lead to pcr failure when primers are designed from a sequence derived from a genotype different to b <dig> from the one used in the dna amplification experiment
 <cit> . this could at least partially explain why we were not able to amplify by pcr the proximal promoter region from conico.

we also analyzed the sequences described as a distal p <dig> enhancer that covers ~630 bp, and it is located  <dig> kbp upstream the transcription start site . this sequence includes a sub-fragment of 458 bp of the p <dig>  enhancer described by sidorenko and peterson
 <cit> . the primers used to clone these sequences are listed in additional file
2: table s <dig>  we were able to get only one sequence from this region for each of the five landraces, and of the inbred lines b <dig> and w <dig>  in this region, we identify three elements that have been described to correspond to binding sites for transcription factors in response to uv-b
 <cit> : a mrechs core , which is present only in the landraces with the exception of cacahuacintle , and two uvboxanac13boxes  and one core corresponding to this box  . both 5 bps long uvboxanac <dig> boxes are present in all analyzed promoter distal sequences, and are separated by only 5 bps with the sequence agc/acc. the uvbox core sequence, present in all the sequences analyzed, is located nine nucleotides upstream an uvboxanac <dig> box . these uvboxesanac <dig> were found significantly enriched in late induced uv-b genes
 <cit> .

we also cloned and analyzed the first p <dig> intron from b <dig>  w <dig> and  <dig> landraces. this intron is usually very small  in myb transcription factors
 <cit> . within the 120 bps of this intron, we only identified five and one nucleotide changes with respect to b <dig> and w <dig> in confite and mishca, respectively . the remaining sequence resulted identical between them and respect to b <dig> and w <dig> 

the six 1st intron sequences harbor an acechs core, located 33 bps from the start of the intron . in the case of mishca, two of the three changes are located at each side of the acechs core .

recently, sequencing data has demonstrated that the maize genome exhibits variable levels of genetic diversity depending on the lines under comparison. on average, the frequency of single nucleotide polymorphisms between two maize inbred lines is approximately  <dig> substitution per  <dig> bases
 <cit> . in our case, the comparison of both the proximal and the distal promoter regions, and the 1st intron of p <dig> between inbred lines and high altitude landraces showed some minor, but possibly still important, sequence variation that may be responsible for the differences observed in p <dig> expression patterns.

together, our analysis of the p1promoter and 1st intron nucleotide sequences in the high altitude landraces and inbred lines suggests that there may be a selective pressure over some regulatory regions that may explain the different uv-b regulation of p <dig> 

nucleotide diversity in p <dig> non-coding regions
finally, nucleotide diversity among the analyzed non-coding regions of the p <dig> alleles was calculated. a total of  <dig> indels and  <dig> polymorphic sites were found in the proximal promoter; while in the distal enhancer, a total of  <dig> indel and  <dig> polymorphic sites were identified. for the 1stp <dig> intron, no indels were found, and a total of  <dig> polymorphic sites were detected , for this region the analysis of diversity denotes a high level of conservation . we calculated two estimates of diversity from our data. nucleotide polymorphism  is calculated from the total number of segregating sites with correction to the sample size
 <cit> , and nucleotide diversity  is the probability that two randomly selected sequences will possess different nucleotides at a site
 <cit> . the nucleotide polymorphism  and diversity  estimated indicated that the distal enhancer region is more diverse than the proximal promoter region . this suggests that the distal enhancer may contain critical regulatory regions for p <dig> expression. the analysis of variability can be correlated with the analysis performed for both phylograms on the non-coding regions of p <dig> 

the radial trees show the diversity present between the landraces and the inbred lines for the proximal and distal promoter regions . evidently this region, near to the sst, may have found a greater selective pressure than the rest of the promoter during selection for better environmental traits under higher radiation levels found at high altitudes or even during domestication to obtain greater yield.

small rnas expressed are complementary to a discrete region of the p <dig> proximal enhancer
the multicopy p <dig> allele is epigenetically regulated, resulting in the phenotype p1-wr  due to hypermethylation
 <cit> . to investigate if the low expression of p <dig> in leaves of the b <dig> line is correlated with the presence of smrnas complementary to different p <dig> regions, smrnas levels were measured by microarray analysis. maize sirna sequences were retrieved from the cereal small rnas database . figure 
5a shows all the sirnas that are complementary to the genomic sequence of p <dig>  the population includes all the species of  <dig> to  <dig> mers sirnas, showing major proportion of 24mers. the highest density of sirnas is localized on the proximal promoter  . within this region of ~110 bps, a total of  <dig> complementary sirnas were identified. we were also able to detect the presence of eight sirna towards the 3’ end of the 2nd intron. 
 <cit> .

using probes complementary to fifteen smrna sequences, a microfluidic microarray-based assay was performed as described in methods. after hybridizing with small rnas extracted from b <dig> maize leaves, ten mature sirnas showed significant expression levels . however, sirnas were detected at different intensity levels, ranging from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . in addition, we were able to detect two smrna which bind to 2nd intron. this 2nd intron region has also been demonstrated to be subject to epigenetic regulation
 <cit> . the levels of expression observed for the smrnas are in the same order of magnitude as those complementary to the mutator transposon and gypsy-type retrotransposon 
 <cit> . it is interesting to note that the region of higher density of sirnas is highly correlated with a zone of palindromes and repeated/inverted sequence within the p <dig> gene . increased dna and histone methylation are proposed to be triggered by double-stranded rna, which is processed into 21– <dig> nucleotide rna molecules
 <cit> . taking this into account, this short region of the proximal promoter could also be a fine regulation point of the expression of p <dig> through a sirna/methylation manner dependent.

mishca protoplasts activate p <dig> expression in response to uv-b
the different p <dig> expression pattern in the high altitude landraces can be attributed to the presence of cis- and/or trans- acting elements in the landraces, which may be absent or inactive in the inbred lines like b <dig> or w <dig>  to address this point, p <dig> promoter constructions using the p <dig> basal promoter region  from mishca and w <dig> were fused to the luciferase reporter gene, and these constructs were then used to transform mishca, w <dig> and b <dig> protoplasts. these protoplasts were irradiated during 8 h with uv-b after transformation with pp1mis::luc or pp1w23::luc, or kept under control conditions in the absence of uv-b, and luciferase activity was analyzed. as a control, protoplasts were co-transformed using a plasmid expressing renilla under the constitutive promoter camv35s promoter .

when w <dig> transformed protoplasts that were irradiated during 8 h were analyzed, we did not observe any significant change in the luc activity after the uv-b treatment, with neither of the two constructs . however, when b <dig> transformed protoplasts were used, the relative luminescence values  obtained showed a low, although significant and similar increase of about 30% in the luciferase activity for both constructs. interestingly, the use of mishca transformed protoplasts produced an even higher and similar increase  than when b <dig> transformed protoplasts were used with the same two constructs after irradiation . based on these results, and taking into account the high sequence identity between the mishca and w <dig> promoter regions used, we hypothesize that the increase in the activity of the promoter using the mishca protoplasts can be attributed to the presence of a p <dig> trans-regulatory factor active in mishca cells in response to uv-b.

discussion
p <dig> is one of the transcription factors that control the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway in maize. while the mechanisms by which p <dig> controls gene expression have been well established , little is known on how the expression of p <dig> is controlled. dna methylation is clearly at play, evidenced by the distinct phenotypes of p1-wr and p1-rr ears
 <cit> . in addition, the unstable factor orange <dig>  allele plays a role controlling whether p <dig> is expressed in vegetative tissues or not
 <cit> . the number of p <dig> copies varies depending on the maize genotype. the p1-rr allele has been well characterized at the molecular level
 <cit>  and contains a single coding sequence, which when expressed, confers pigmentation to both the kernel pericarp and the cob
 <cit> . other allelic variants contain different p <dig> copy numbers within their genomes. for example, the p1-wr allele is composed of six gene copies arranged in a tandem head-to-tail array , and the b <dig> inbred line present a multiple copy p <dig> cluster
 <cit> .

in addition, the multicopy p <dig> allele is epigenetically regulated, resulting in the phenotype p1-wr  due to hypermethylation
 <cit> . however, the degree of methylation is modulated by the presence of unstable factor for orange <dig> , which leads to ectopic pigmentation of pericarp and other organs when induces progressive hypomethylation over generations
 <cit> . paramutation was first described for the maize red <dig>  gene
 <cit> . subsequently, three more regulatory genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, b <dig> , pl <dig> , and p <dig> <cit>  were shown to undergo paramutation in maize
 <cit> . for example, the p1-wr gene copies are hypermethylated in their coding and non-coding regions relative to the p1-rr allele; the p1-wr multi-copy structure possibly results in intra-allelic interactions that give rise to silencing of p1-wr expression in the kernel pericarp
 <cit> . functional analysis of p1-wr promoter and coding sequences in transgenic maize plants, as well as studies of natural p <dig> variants, have provided further support for the hypothesis that the organ-specific expression pattern of p1-wr is epigenetically regulated
 <cit> .

here, we focused on the analysis of p <dig> expression in leaves and its regulation by uv-b radiation in high altitude maize landraces, and its comparison with low altitude inbred lines, like b <dig> and w <dig>  using young leaves of five different maize high-altitude landraces, we found that p <dig> is induced by uv-b, both at the transcript and at the protein levels, in contrast to b <dig> or w <dig>  which showed almost undetectable expression levels, and very low induction by uv-b. in addition, p <dig> is able to increase the transcription of the chs gene after a uv-b treatment in confite, while up-regulation of this gene by uv-b is not observed in w <dig> . previously, we found that an 8 h-long uv-b-treatment can induce the expression of enzymes of the flavonoid pathway in maize
 <cit> . chalcone synthase  is a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. maize has two chs genes, c <dig> and whp
 <cit> . it had been shown that the expression of the c <dig> gene is induced by low levels of uv-b/uv-a/blue light, and its function is largely regulated at the level of transcription
 <cit> . in addition, ectopic expression of p <dig> in maize protoplasts is also sufficient to induce c <dig> in vivo <cit> . thus, it is clear that p <dig> participates in the uv-b induction of the flavonoid pathway in leaves of high altitude landraces, but not in leaves of low altitude lines.

taking into account the high allelic variability already described for p <dig> <cit> , ranging from the simple-copy p1-rr allele, to the multiple-copy tandem organization present in the b <dig> genome, we estimated the copy number of p <dig> in each genome of the high altitude landraces. besides the high divergence that we found exists in the number of alleles present between the landraces , there is a correlation between the p <dig> copy number and the place of origin of the different races. for instance, arrocillo, cacahuacintle and conico, with the lowest copy number , were collected in mexico, from altitudes ranging between  <dig> and 2800 m.; while both the andean south american races mishca, which grows at 2200–2800 m, and confite puneño, which has adapted to live at 3600–3900 m, have  <dig> and  <dig> copies of p <dig>  respectively. evidently, this variability could be related to the selective pressure during the domestication to select adaptive traits, in this case to be able to grow under conditions of high incidence of uv-b.

we also cloned and sequenced two fragments of the p <dig> promoter region  and the first intron from the landraces under study, and from b <dig> and w <dig>  the analysis allowed us to determinate the presence of different allelic variants, the presence of variable numbers of indels and the location of them within these promoter sequences. we also analyzed the presence of different dna motifs that may participate in the regulation by uv-b in the promoter regions. for example, both the mishca and the w <dig> p <dig> promoter regions contain seven uvboxes  distributed within the ~ <dig> -kbp proximal promoter analyzed and one acechscore 
 <cit>  . assuming that this element is of importance in the induction by uv-b, we found only one difference between both promoter regions that could give different uv-b regulation, which is the unequal number of core aceanac <dig>  located near the tss, mishca having three and only two present in w <dig>  another difference is the presence of a 24 bps sequence in the w <dig> promoter, which includes a sequence highly similar to a sir  described by goettel and messing
 <cit>  of 14 bp that is also present the terminal inverted repeats of mutator-like transposons. this indel produces a displacement of the acechs and all the uvboxes from the aceanac <dig> core in w <dig>  however, when transient expression analysis using leaf protoplasts from w <dig> and mishca, and proximal promoter constructs fused to the luciferase gene reporter from both lines were done , we found that differences in gene regulation by uv-b are largely a consequence of effects in trans-, suggesting that these regulatory sequence differences are not the causal reasons for the difference in expression. rather, our results suggest the presence of a regulatory protein in mishca protoplasts that responds to uv-b, which may be able to bind to regulatory sequences in the promoter of p <dig> 

to further analyze other possible mechanisms that may participate in the regulation of the expression of p <dig> in maize leaves, an analysis of the presence of small rnas in leaves of the b <dig> line was conducted. our results indicate that there is a high number of smrnas complementary to a specific region in the basal p <dig> promoter of about 100 bps, which includes a repeated-inverted sequence. this region is a target of more than  <dig> smrnas . until now, little evidence existed respect to the mechanism and participation of these small rnas in p <dig> silencing. analysis of these smrnas levels in leaves of high altitude landraces, and their levels after uv-b exposure are currently under study to understand their possible involvement in the induction of p <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that p <dig> expression is increased in response to uv-b in high altitude maize landraces, and p <dig> binding to the c <dig> promoter is increased by uv-b in at least one if these landraces. although polymorphisms exist between the p <dig> basal promoter sequences of the landraces and low altitude lines, we found that differences in gene regulation by uv-b are largely a consequence of effects in trans-, suggesting that these regulatory sequence differences are not the causal reasons for the difference in expression. the analysis of the presence of small rnas in leaves of the b <dig> line show that there is a high number of smrnas complementary to a specific region in the basal p <dig> promoter, the role of these smrnas in the regulation of p <dig> leaf expression and uv-b regulation is under study.
