BACKGROUND
malaria continues to be a major public health and socio-economic problem in developing countries, and in  <dig>  it still caused  <dig>  deaths . multifaceted control efforts are directed towards reducing malaria transmission, including vector control, early diagnosis, and effective treatment. recently, the introduction of artemisinin combination therapies  to deal with continually evolving multidrug resistance is a cornerstone of malaria chemotherapy, but this too is faltering and is spreading at a faster pace than anticipated  <cit> . as parasites continue to develop resistance to existing antimalarial drugs, continued research on developing new antimalarials remains a high priority  <cit> . one such approach has used systems biology methods in this postgenomic era of plasmodium to identify multiple novel pathways in the parasite as potential drug targets . information gleaned from comparative genomic analysis and functional studies has contributed to improving our understanding of the parasite’s biology and our ability to design new control measures, and understanding basic regulatory mechanisms that parasite has evolved may help to guide future decisions in selecting targets.

the plasmodium life cycle includes multiple stages with drastically different morphologies in a mosquito vector and a vertebrate host. this sophisticated developmental program requires regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis  <cit> . even with the discovery of the ap2-domain specific transcriptional factors  <cit> , the parasite genome is still relatively deficient in identifiable transcriptional regulators  <cit> , implying that post-transcriptional regulation  is an important means of regulation of gene expression. furthermore, comparative studies examining the parasite’s transcriptomes and proteomes revealed significant lags in protein abundance relative to mrna abundance  <cit> . during intraerythrocytic development, the half-life of mrnas is substantially extended at the schizont stage when compared with that at the ring stage  <cit> . translational regulation plays particularly critical roles during parasite transmission, when the parasites must remain relatively quiescent for an extended period of time before transmission occurs  <cit> . in the specific stages  that are transmitted, many mrnas that are needed for subsequent development are kept in a translationally repressed state. premature expression of these mrnas leads to considerable defects in development  <cit> . altogether, these studies underscore the importance of post-transcriptional control in the development of the malaria parasite.

from transcription to degradation, every step of mrna metabolism is subject to extensive regulation. through mrna maturation, export, subcellular localization, stability, and degradation, rnas are accompanied by rna-binding proteins  and are thus found as messenger ribonucleoproteins . rbps also play crucial roles in processing of stable rnas such as rrna, trna, snrna, and snorna  <cit> . the significance of rbps in translational regulation is underscored by their abundance in diverse eukaryotes. for example, the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes ~ <dig> rbps  <cit> , whereas in humans the number of rbps is considerably larger with at least  <dig> genes containing the rna recognition motif  alone  <cit> . to date, more than a dozen rna-binding domains  have been identified and the best-characterized domains include rrms, rna helicases, zinc-finger domains , k homology , pumilio and fem- <dig> binding factor , and acetylation lowers binding affinity  families. while most of our understanding about rbps and their functions comes from studies of model organisms, their importance in the development of plasmodium has recently been more appreciated . given the potential roles of rbps in virtually every aspect of rna metabolism and in every part of the life cycle of the malaria parasites, we performed a comprehensive in silico analysis of rbps in the malaria parasite p. falciparum. many recent studies have also found that some rna-interacting proteins may not possess commonly known rbds  <cit> , however, in this study we have used commonly known rbds for the searches to ensure only more robust predictions are made. using a set of bioinformatic tools, we identified  <dig> putative rbps in the malaria parasite genome that contain well-characterized rbds and provide functional annotation based on homology, domain organization, and expression patterns.

RESULTS
using a combination of search strategies, we identified a total of  <dig> putative rbps in the p. falciparum genome including  <dig> with the rrm,  <dig> putative rna helicases,  <dig> with the kh domain,  <dig> with the puf domain,  <dig> with the alba domain,  <dig> with zinc fingers , and  <dig> other minor families of rbps . most of these putative rbps in plasmodium lack definitive functional annotations. for functional predictions, each of these rbps was blast searched against the model species by considering the total query sequence coverage against the template and the degree of domain-architecture conservation. this analysis allowed functional predictions for  <dig> putative rbps . while  <dig> of genes are conserved both in plasmodium vivax and plasmodium yoelii with clearly identifiable orthologs,  <dig> of the genes are lost in either or both p. vivax or p. yoelii .

rna-binding domains and rbps in plasmodium
rna-recognition motif 
the rrm is by far the most versatile and abundant rbd reported from bacteria to higher eukaryotes. the motif is about 70– <dig> amino acids in length and contains two consensus rna-interacting motifs: rnp <dig> and rnp <dig>  in the protein family database pfam, rrms are classified into ten different families based on profile similarities. we utilized representative sequences from individual rrm families as seeds to perform blast and hidden markov model  searches in the p. falciparum genome to derive a final list of  <dig> rrm domains distributed in  <dig> proteins . the number of rrm proteins in an organism appears to have increased through evolution, with higher-order species having more rrm proteins . one exception is toxoplasma gondii, a closely related species to plasmodium, which encodes more than twice as many rrm proteins than p. falciparum. compared with model organisms, plasmodium species encode a similar number of rrm proteins as the yeast s. cerevisiae, which has a comparable genome size . five rrm families were found in plasmodium genomes, whereas five other families  are completely absent. rrm_ <dig> family is the most abundant with  <dig> members, followed by rrm_ <dig> and _ <dig> with  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. rrm_ <dig> and _ <dig> families only have one member . interestingly, rrm_ <dig> family is supposedly specific to plants and fungi and is vastly expanded in plants . the identification of the rrm_ <dig> family member in plasmodium suggests that this family in apicomplexans is likely derived from its red algae symbiont ancestor.table  <dig> list of different pfam- and other profile families used to search rbps from p. falciparum along with corresponding number of genes found in p. falciparum

p. falciparum rrms are divided into five rrm-families. a a multiple sequence alignment of 3d structures derived from representative members of each of the rrm families  found in p. falciparum is provided. rrm_ <dig> is found to be highly diversified from typical rrm classes  followed by rrm_ <dig>  b phylogenetic reconstruction of evolutionary relationship between rrm families from p. falciparum. phylogenetic reconstruction of rrm families using representative domains from multiple pfrrms failed to resolve the rrm families as expected, which may be due to relative number of rrms used to represent each class . c representative 3d homology models for each of the rrm family were constructed using 3ucg, 3u1l, 2evz, 1p <dig> and 3zef pdb models as a reference to pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig>  respectively. it can clearly be seen that rrm <dig>  is divergent from other members both at the primary sequence and structural level



comparative inferences drawn from other species show that the presence of single and multiple rrms in a protein is relatively common across different species  <cit> . among the  <dig> rrm proteins in p. falciparum,  <dig> contain a single rrm, whereas  <dig> contain more than one rrm . in addition,  <dig> of  <dig> rrm proteins have one or more of the  <dig> different types of other protein domains such as wwp repeating motif, really interesting new gene , c3h <dig> and c2h <dig> znf, g-patch, suppressor-of-white-apricot , or poly interacting domain .table  <dig> the frequencies of occurrence of rrm in single, modular and multi-domain organization in p. falciparum


















blue , pink  and green  boxes are used to denote transmembrane, low complexity, and coiled-coil regions respectively



the average length of the rrm in p. falciparum is  <dig> aa  , which is similar to what has been reported in other species. comparison of the different rrm families in plasmodium found that the rrm_ <dig> member prp <dig> splicing factor is evolutionarily divergent from the other four families . divergence of rrm_ <dig> and rrm_ <dig> family members from the other three major families is particularly noticeable in the rna-binding motifs rnp <dig> and  <dig> . phylogenetic analysis using only rrm-domain sequences of representatives from rrm_1- <dig> families failed to resolve evolutionary relationships as expected. for example, all rrm_ <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> did not form monophyletic clades . nonetheless, modeling of representative members of the five rrm families showed that the predicted structures conform to the typical organization of rrm and contains four anti-parallel beta strands and two alpha helices arranged as β1α1β2β3α2β <dig>  while showing sufficient diversity in overall 3d structures . for example, the rrm_ <dig> family’s  predicted 3d structure is highly diversified from the rest of the families.

phylogeny-based orthology prediction identified one-to-one orthologs from p. vivax and p. yoelii except in two instances  where they were lost in p. yoelii. both genes possess an sr domain and are predicted to participate in pre-mrna splicing and export . no recent duplications and species-specific expansion of rrm family genes were identified in a particular plasmodium species , suggesting evolutionary constraints on independent evolution of the rrm gene family.

phylogenetic analysis also identified four cug-bp elav-like  proteins and four potential poly-binding proteins  in plasmodium. all celf proteins have a similar multidomain organization with rrm domains flanking a variable ww domain, and they might have resulted from two gene duplication events . pfcelf <dig> has recently been found to be a nuclear protein and participate in splicing  <cit> . comparative bioinformatic analysis with human, drosophila and arabidopsis homologs classified the four plasmodium pabps into one nuclear and three cytoplasmic pabps . one cytoplasmic pabp  is evolutionarily conserved while the other three might have specifically acquired by plasmodium species.

because most of the plasmodium rrm genes have not been characterized, we performed a variety of predictions of their functions. thirty p. falciparum rrm proteins are predicted to participate in pre-mrna splicing , alternative splicing , transport , ribosome biogenesis , rna degradation , translation , and post-transcriptional regulation . there are  <dig> other genes with different cellular functions while  <dig> genes are plasmodium-specific with unknown functions  . functional analysis is needed to verify these predictions.

rna helicases
helicases are ubiquitous in nature and are considered to have evolved from near the very root of the evolutionary tree. typically, helicases function in the separation of double-stranded rna, dna, and rna/dna structures in an energy-dependent manner  <cit> . based on sequence similarities and domain conservation, helicases are classified into five superfamilies; superfamily ii  is the most studied and most widely distributed in eukaryotes. major components of sfii are dexd/h  helicase family members that primarily function in rna metabolism including chaperoning snrnas that participate in pre-mrna splicing  <cit> .

blast and hmm searches of the p. falciparum genome using three pfam helicase families, pf <dig> , pf <dig>  and pf <dig>  retrieved  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative helicases , respectively, similar to the number of helicases found in a previous study  <cit> . we further combined all three sets to derive a final set of  <dig> putative helicases in plasmodium. helicase members identified using pf <dig> and pf <dig> were all included in the set identified by using pf <dig> as the seed. pf <dig> is highly conserved from bacteria to eukaryotes and has one gene on average in each species, suggesting an early origin of this family. a previous text-based search of the p. falciparum genome retrieved  <dig> helicases,  <dig> of which with dead helicase family signatures  <cit> . with the lack of definitive features to bioinformatically classify helicases as dna- and/or rna-binding, it is generally considered that the dexd family preferentially binds rna . to circumvent difficulty in classifying rna helicases, we performed a blastp search against five model species and trypanosomes with all putative helicases in order to predict their functions. this allowed us to retain  <dig> helicases as rna helicases either due to the presence of an rna-binding ortholog in other species or confirmation of binding to rna in p. falciparum. further mapping of the conserved motifs and domains classified  <dig> of them as dexd helicases , which make up 80 % of total helicases in p. falciparum. comparative genomic analysis showed that higher-order species have larger repertoires of helicases compared to lower strata, suggestive of lineage-specific evolution of the gene family. however, species in similar strata have comparable level of helicases; for example, plasmodium spp. and toxoplasma spp. have  <dig> and  <dig> helicases respectively .table  <dig> a comparative table of helicases from different phyla

of the  <dig> rna helicases,  <dig> contain a single helicase domain, whereas the remaining  <dig> contain additional domains such as helicase associated domain , oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding fold , spry, suv <dig>  c2hc, s- <dig> and dsh c-terminal domain  . similar to the conservation of the rrm superfamily in plasmodium spp., a search of the p. vivax and p. yoelii genomes with all putative helicases detected a 1: <dig> ortholog match in these species. furthermore, each plasmodium species has  <dig> and  <dig> dexd and dexh helicases, respectively, which is comparable to the numbers found in humans  and s. cerevisiae   <cit> . this particular aspect, in conjunction with evolutionary inferences, highlights the conservation of these helicases across the species boundaries. this observation is further substantiated by the phylogenetic relationship among the helicases in p. falciparum. all the tree nodes have been consistently supported with high bootstrap values suggesting early origin of the helicases, which is also suggestive of evolutionarily conserved functions .table  <dig> the frequencies of occurrence of rna helicases in single, modular and multi-domain organization in p. falciparum













blue , pink  and green  boxes are used to denote transmembrane, low complexity, and coiled-coil regions, respectively



to further illustrate the conservation of sequence motifs in rna helicases in plasmodium, a representative 3d model of rna helicases was constructed using pf3d7_ <dig>  as a query and atp-dependent rna helicase ddx <dig>  as a template . all helicases have an evolutionarily conserved core structure made of two reca-like, tandemly linked domains  <cit> . these domains possess all conserved residues required for nucleic acid binding , atp binding and atpase activities. at the sequence level, helicases are divided into two domains  with nine conserved motifs, q, i, ia, ib and from ii to vi  <cit> . alignment of all  <dig> helicases and mapping the motif-specific sequence logos onto the 3d structure further confirmed the conservation in sequences and predicted structure . unlike rrms, helicases are also highly conserved in their primary structure.fig.  <dig> 
p. falciparum rna-helicases retain the canonical conserved sequence motifs. a a representative 3d model of rna helicase was constructed using pf3d7_ <dig>  as a query and atp-dependent rna helicase ddx <dig>  as a template. b a categorization of putative functional roles of rna helicases in p. falciparum. c a representation of the canonical, conserved catalytic rna helicase domain is provided. each functional unit of the helicase domain is divided into two functional units, walker a and walker b, which are further categorized into eight highly conserved sequence motifs named i, ia, ib and from ii to vi. walker a consists of an atpase functional portion while walker b has roles in atp hydrolysis and nucleic acids unwinding  <cit> . the relative conservation of each of the conserved motifs in  <dig> pfrna-helicases has been summarized in sequence logs. it can be seen that dexd/h at motif ii is highly conserved suggestive of most of the rna-helicases have this domain



with regard to the functions of rna helicases, generally deah helicases are involved in pre-mrna processing, while dead helicases participate in ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . in p. falciparum, pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig>  pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> all have a conserved deah domain and are classified as prp  proteins. similarly, almost all of the proteins classified under ribosome biogenesis  have a conserved dead domain, indicative of evolutionary conservation of the protein synthesis apparatus. however, numerous exceptions to these rules have been observed, so these classifications should be experimentally confirmed and manually curated.

we performed a gene enrichment analysis using information on assigned biological processes as well as molecular functional information available from uniprot . from this analysis,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were classified as rna-binding and mrna processing, respectively, leaving the rest of the members unassigned. however, we could manually assign functions to 70 % of the rna helicases from p. falciparum to ribosome biogenesis and related , pre-mrna processing , rna degradation , mrna turnover , genome repair and maintenance , and post-transcriptional regulation . further corroborating the fact that helicases mainly take part in ribosome biogenesis,  <dig> of the  <dig> dexd/h helicases have a dexd domain , while  <dig> have a dexh domain . whereas  <dig> genes have homologs in model species without known functions, two genes  appeared to be specific for the plasmodium group. though helicases are potential targets for drug design  <cit> , very few of them have been characterized in p. falciparum  <cit> . one such helicase  is essential to the development of the zygote in infected mosquitoes, and traffics a substantial portion of the mrna pool to storage granules  <cit> . it would be interesting to see if plasmodium specific helicases perform unique functions.

kh domain
the kh domain was first identified in the human heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein k  or pre-mrna-binding protein k almost two decades ago  <cit> . the functional domain is about  <dig> aa in size, which primarily binds rna . kh domain proteins have a diverse regulatory portfolio, which includes transcription and translational regulation, rna metabolism, and chromatin remodeling  <cit> .

blast and hmm searches of the p. falciparum genome using two different search criteria with pfam families  and superfamilies  identified  <dig> kh domains in  <dig> genes . only two pfam families  identified  <dig> and  <dig> kh genes respectively, whereas searches using two superfamilies revealed the presence of additional five genes with kh domains. phylogenetic analysis of kh domain genes found that the five genes identified using the two-superfamily sequences formed a monophyletic group , composed of members with predictable functions . based on evolutionary origin and secondary structures, kh domain has been classified into two families—type-i and type-ii  <cit> . type-i mainly occurs in eukaryotes and can form modular structures, while type-ii is of prokaryotic origin and mostly occurs alone  <cit> . analyzing domain structure of plasmodium kh domain proteins revealed  <dig> and  <dig>  type- <dig> and type-ii members, respectively. the 3d homology models constructed using a type-i  and type-ii  kh domain illustrate such differences in the two domain types . conservation of these two prokaryotic genes that potentially function in ribosome biogenesis  <cit>  suggests an early origin of the translational machinery. two genes, pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> are found to occur with other domains  .fig.  <dig> pfkhs are divided into two gene families based on their evolutionary origin and sequence conservation. a a phylogeny showing two monophyletic clades created from pfam- and superfamily-based retrievals. b categorization of functional roles by kh domain genes in p. falciparum is provided. c a representative 3d model was constructed for type-i & type-ii kh domain using pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> as queries using 2anr and 4d <dig>  respectively. typical secondary structure of type-i  & type-ii kh domain  are marked onto the model



functional annotation through blastp search showed seven of the eleven kh domain genes have well-defined homologs in model species, allowing better prediction of their potential roles. two kh domain genes are predicted to function in mrna processing, three in ribosome biogenesis, one each in poly-  and poly-binding , and in splicing . interestingly, a recent study of a kh domain gene pf3d7_ <dig> indicated it as a novel specific transcription factor  <cit> . this may be possible since some of the kh domains are found to interact with both rna and ssdna  <cit> . similar to other rbps, all the kh domain genes have orthologs in p. vivax and p. yoelii. we failed to detect homologs for four kh domain genes except in plasmodium species, implying genus-specific evolution of kh proteins in malaria parasites.

puf domains
puf is named after the two founding members from pumilio in drosophila protein and fbf  in caenorhabditis elegans. they represent an evolutionarily conserved class of translational repressors from a wide range of eukaryotic species, and are known to have diverse functions such as sexual differentiation and development, stem cell maintenance and neurogenesis  <cit> . the puf domain typically consists of eight homologous repeat units, each consisting of about  <dig> amino acids. puf domains form a modular structure that can interact with eight ribonucleotides, with each repeat recognizing a single base. two puf proteins, puf <dig> and puf <dig> have been identified in all sequenced plasmodium species   <cit> . homology modeling of the two puf domains in p. falciparum showed a modular structure consistent with the typical puf domain structure . puf <dig> and puf <dig> have been characterized to regulate sexual development and transition from the mosquito vector to vertebrate hosts  <cit> . genetic deletion of puf <dig> in p. berghei and p. yoelii leads to severe defects in sporozoite morphology and transmissibility, misregulation of mrna transcript abundances, and in some cases affects male/female gametocyte ratios  <cit> . over expression and knockdown of pfpuf <dig> expression in p. falciparum showed repression and elevation of gametocytogenesis, respectively  <cit> . a study by miao et al. show that pfpuf <dig> regulates translationally repressed transcripts by interacting with puf-binding elements  located in both 3′- and 5′- untranslated regions  <cit> . for the first time, that study underscores the importance of 5′ utrs in post-transcriptional regulation by puf proteins, which now prompts investigations into additional regulation by pfpufs.

alba
the alba domain, formerly known as sso10b, was first identified and characterized from a hyperthermophilic archaeon  <cit> . recent studies confirmed its presence in all domains of life. previous studies have characterized four alba proteins  in plasmodium, which showed functional similarities to the canonical forms identified in sulfolobus spp.  <cit> . using pf <dig> and profile searches against p. falciparum genome in hammer, we identified two new members  . pfalba <dig> is highly diverged from rest of the group with only limited sequence identities with other plasmodium alba proteins . phylogenetic reconstruction showed pfalba1- <dig> and 3– <dig> formed two separate monophyletic clades leaving newly identified albas as singletons . interestingly, out of these four, three genes have undefined homologs in arabidopsis suggesting their evolutionary conservation. blast searches with lower e-value  failed to identify homologs outside apicomplexa suggesting possible lineage-specific evolution of pfalba <dig> and  <dig>  it is therefore interesting to see the functions of these putatively novel genes in plasmodium species. to further map the conserved nucleic acid binding interface of pfalbas, domain-only specific sequences with the conserved residues at 70 % of consensus level were extracted and mapped, which illuminated that the amino acid positions putatively interacting with dna/rna are also conserved in pfalba <dig>   <dig> . a 3d model of pfalba <dig>  with the archaea-specific dna-binding protein  as the template showed 27 % identity through 77 % of query coverage . typically alba domains form a homodimer of two 10 kda subunits. the predicted pfalba <dig> model showed the conserved feature of an extended β sheet hairpin loop  <cit> . pfalba proteins exist as a single domain as well as in association with other functional domains such as rgg box—a rna-binding motif in pfalba <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . alba proteins are conserved with corresponding orthologs in other plasmodium species .fig.  <dig> a comparison of identifiable alba proteins in p. falciparum. a a representative 3d model of an alba domain is constructed using pf3d7_ <dig> as a query and 2h9u as a template, and phylogenetic reconstruction of pfalbas showing alba <dig>   <dig> and alba <dig>   <dig> are monophyletic groups. b a multiple sequence alignment of the alba domain sequences from pfalba1- <dig>  illustrated are the predicted secondary structural elements  and conserved residues highlighted at 70 % consensus putatively interact with nucleic acids. key for color-coded and highlighted amino acids letters are: negative de; aliphatic ilv; positive mkr; tiny ags; aromatic fhwy; charged dehkr; small acognpstv; polar cdehknqrst; big efiklmqrwy; hydrophobic acfghiklmrtvwy. the same color code is applied to rest of the alignments used in this manuscript. c a matrix of the percent identities for pairwise comparisons of pfalbas 1– <dig> is provided



the alba domain has been implicated in transcriptional and translational regulation through its ability to bind both dna and rna, and due to its association with sir <dig>  <cit> . functional annotation of pfalbas is not possible based on homology searches of genomes of model organisms. whereas homologs of alba1- <dig> were found in arabidopsis with unknown functions, we did not identify homologs of alba4- <dig> in model organisms even after relaxing the search parameters, suggesting a lineage-specific evolution. similar to the canonical alba proteins, pfalba1- <dig> were reported to bind both dna and rna  <cit> . several alba proteins from apicomplexa  were reported to be involved in diverse cellular functions such as binding and regulating their own transcripts, regulating transcription through condensation of chromatin, and post-transcriptional regulation of mrnas involved in development . pfalba <dig> is essential for asexual erythrocytic development and binds to ~30 % of the trophozoite transcriptome, regulating the timing of the translation  <cit> . yeast two-hybrid data revealed interactions between pfalba <dig> and  <dig>  similar observations were made for toxoplasma tgalba <dig> and tgalba <dig>  where the former depends on the latter for expression  <cit> . in p. berghei, pbalba1- <dig> were associated with the dozi and cith translational repression complexes, confirming their roles in plasmodium rna biology  <cit> .

zinc finger domain
zinc finger  domains are small protein domains present in all forms of life and are one of the most studied domains in transcription factors. the functional versatility of the znf-containing proteins arises from the modular structure of znfs, which can be found in multiple copies and in different forms. at least  <dig> different types of znfs have been identified in mammalian transcriptomes  <cit> . znfs are classified into various groups based on structural similarities, including the number of zinc ligands they bind, and the arrangement and the number of cysteine  and histidine  residues surrounding one or more zinc atoms  <cit> . znfs can bind dna, rna, or protein, and the distance between two znf domains on a protein critically influences these interactions. the most characterized forms of rna-binding znf forms are c2h <dig> and c3h <dig>  which fold to create rna-binding surfaces composed of α-helices and aromatic side chains  <cit> .

using various pfam and other profile families as seed sequences , we retrieved a total of  <dig> putative rna-binding znf proteins. of which,  <dig> and  <dig> genes belong to the c3h <dig> and c2h <dig> forms, respectively. both c3h <dig> and c2h <dig> znfs coexist with other protein domains such as the rrm, ring, yth, and pwi domains  and the cactinc and ranb <dig> domains  . based on homology searches, functional annotation was possible for eight of the eleven c2h <dig> genes; five genes may be involved in splicing and two in ribosome biogenesis. for  <dig> of the  <dig> c3h <dig> genes, specific functions could not be ascertained due to lack of orthologs in model species .

other potential rbds
in addition to the major rbds described above, we identified several minor rbp families including proteins containing the pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine transglycosylase  domain, yt521-b homology, s- <dig> motif, swap , pwi, and g-patch motif. all these minor domains have predicted orthologs in p. vivax and p. yoelii genomes.

the pua is a compact 67– <dig> aa motif frequently found in rna modification enzymes and nucleoproteins  <cit> . the motif is also commonly found in other proteins that have functional roles in translation and ribosome biogenesis  <cit> . our analysis revealed five pua containing genes . functional annotation of these genes indicates that they may have potential roles in trna and rrna post-transcriptional modifications and maturation, rna methylation, and translation initiation. in plasmodium, the pua domain is found to coexist with the s-adenosyl methionine domain  and the dkcld domain .

the yth  constitutes a new class of rbp in eukaryotes  <cit> , which was first identified and characterized in the yt521-b protein  <cit> . the domain is typically 100– <dig> aa in length, and is rich in aromatic residues that are reminiscent of rrm and pua domains  <cit> . the domain is found to have functions in alternative splicing and the prevention of untimely meiosis in yeast through the degradation of meiosis-specific transcripts during vegetative growth  <cit> . two genes were identified in the p. falciparum genome  that encode this domain and other putative rbds such as the c3h <dig> znf . in silico functional annotation suggests that the yth domain may participate in modulating alternative splicing, mrna cleavage and polyadenylation in p. falciparum.

the s <dig> motif was first identified in e. coli ribosomal s <dig> protein and exhibits an evolutionarily conserved nucleic acid binding ob  structural fold  <cit> . the s <dig> motif in p. falciparum was found to co-exist with other rbds such as kh and rna helicase domains. these proteins may be involved in pre-mrna processing, ribosome biogenesis and translation in plasmodium .

the swap domain was first identified in drosophila splicing regulators. pfam searches of the p. falciparum genome revealed the presence of two genes with the swap domains, namely pf3d <dig>  and pf3d7_ <dig> . while pf3d7_ <dig> has two swap domains, the pf3d7_ <dig> has one swap domain with one rrm .

the pwi domain is an another rna-binding domain first reported in splicing factors  <cit> . of the three pwi-containing genes in p. falciparum, one  also has an n-terminal rrm domain. pwi genes may play roles in splicing and alternative splicing in plasmodium .

the glycine-rich nucleic acid binding domain called g-patch was first described by aravind and koonin  <cit> . we identified three g-patch genes  in p. falciparum genome. only pf3d7_ <dig> is associated with an rrm .

functional roles of plasmodium rbps
rbps are at the center of rna metabolism and involved in all aspects of rna biology. based mostly on homology with rbps in model organisms with known functions, we manually annotated the predicted functions of some putative rbps in plasmodium and categorized them into various cellular processes.

rbps in splicing
splicing of precursor mrnas is carried out by a specialized, massive ribonucleoprotein  complex termed the spliceosome, which is highly conserved in eukaryotes. the spliceosome consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoproteins  and non-snrnps such as serine/arginine-rich  family proteins  <cit> . although splicing in plasmodium remains to be fully characterized  <cit> , some conserved components of the splicing machinery have been identified , including five snrnas  <cit>  and  <dig> rbps with putative functions in pre-mrna splicing . among them,  <dig> and  <dig> proteins belong to the rrm and rna helicase families, respectively. all of the major spliceosome initiation factors—u2af <dig>  u2af <dig>  sf <dig>  sf3b, pre-rna processing   <dig>  prp <dig>  sf3a <dig>  snrpc, zranb <dig>  and snu <dig> are encoded by the plasmodium genome. in addition, proteins involved in the proofreading of the splicing and joining processes such as prp <dig>  prp <dig>  and prp <dig> were also identified in the plasmodium genome  <cit>  . pfprp <dig> has been shown to bind rna and hydrolyze atp in the presence of helicase associated domain   <cit> .table  <dig> list of genes and their putative functions involved in splicing mechanism in p. falciparum




alternative splicing creates multiple transcripts from a single gene, thus contributing to the diversity of the cellular proteome without a need for genomic expansion. while 95 % of multi-exon genes have more than one transcript isoform in humans, alternative splicing also occurs in p. falciparum, albeit to a much lesser extent . rna-seq analyses of the p. falciparum transcriptomes found evidence for alternative splicing in about  <dig> genes  <cit> . through bioinformatic analysis, we identified  <dig> genes in p. falciparum with predicted roles in alternative splicing . most of these genes are from the sr  and the celf  families. sr family proteins have rrm domain and arginine-serine repeats. two sr genes in p. falciparum  were shown to bind to rna  <cit> , and pfsrrm <dig> was predicted to regulate alternative splicing  <cit> . pfsf <dig>  a homolog of serine/arginine-rich splicing factor  <dig> or pre-mrna-splicing factor sf <dig>  was predicted to function in alternative splicing in p. falciparum and affected parasite proliferation in erythrocytes  <cit> . the celf/bruno-like family rbps regulate pre-mrna splicing/alternative splicing in the nucleus, as well as mrna deadenylation and translation in the cytoplasm . of the four plasmodium celf family genes, pfcelf <dig> was characterized to function in pre-mrna processing  <cit> . the polypyrimidine tract binding proteins , a family of multiple rrm domain containing proteins, regulate alternative splicing by binding to the polypyrimidine regulatory tracts that exist in introns  <cit> . while at least two ptbps are found in the human genome, we only identified one ptbp-like protein, pfptbp <dig>  in the p. falciparum genome .

rna maturation, exon-exon junction complex formation and mrna shuttling
rna maturation in eukaryotes includes 5′ methyl capping and 3′ poly -tailing of mrnas. these processes are predicted to be conserved in malaria parasites. among them, pf3d7_ <dig> is a homolog of the 30 kda subunit of human cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor , an rna-binding endonuclease playing a role in 3′ processing of pre-mrna  <cit> . following complete maturation, export of mrnas to the cytoplasm is achieved by a special mrnp complex termed the exon-exon junction complex   <cit> . it is comprised of a mixture of mrna export factors—aly/ref, tap, upf3b, uap <dig>  <cit> , and nonsense mediated mrna surveillance  components—y <dig> and magoh. our analysis identified all of the known homologs of both ejc and nmd complexes; however, their predicted functions have yet to be confirmed in p. falciparum except for pfuap <dig> which was shown to harbor rna binding and helicase activities that depend upon glycine  <dig>  isoleucine  <dig> and arginine  <dig>  <cit> .

rbps in ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation
ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes involves the processing of rrnas, assembly of the 40s and 60s subunit precursors in the nucleus, and export of the precursors to the cytoplasm. most of the ribosomal proteins fall into various energy-consuming enzyme families including the atp-dependent rna helicases. comparative genomic analyses using the yeast proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis identified  <dig> p. falciparum helicases with potential roles in this process . interestingly, all but one  helicase homolog involved in ribosome biogenesis was identified in plasmodium. these helicases are further divided into eight and nine helicases involved in small subunit and large subunit pre-processing, respectively. similar to other rbp classes, all of these homologs remain to be experimentally characterized in p. falciparum .table  <dig> a list of genes and their putative functions involved in ribosome biogenesis in p. falciparum

rbps in genome repair and maintenance
genome repair and maintenance are crucial for the integrity of the genome. based on a homology search, we identified two rbps from the p. falciparum genome that have putative functions in genome maintenance. human ddx <dig> is reported to be activated by phosphorylation in response to double-stranded breaks in dna. ddx <dig> has rnase activity towards single-stranded rna as well as adp-dependent rna-dna- and rna-rna-unwinding activities  <cit> . the putative ddx <dig> homolog from plasmodium  is highly conserved with 29 % identity at 93 % total gene coverage. another gene, pf3d7_ <dig> has a c-terminal domain resembling the yeast suv3p protein, which is associated with mitochondrial genome stability  <cit> .

rbps in rna granules, degradation and translational regulation
rna granules  formed during stress and non-stress conditions provide a well-conserved means for a cell to regulate its gene expression. although they all regulate rna homeostasis in a cell, their compositions and functions are different. moreover, the classification and functional assignment of these granules is fluid, as they are now thought to exist in a continuum and are only loosely defined by the presence/absence of various protein and rna components  <cit> . classically, stress granules form in response to different stressors, for example depletion of glucose. stress granules typically contain translation initiation factors  and pabps  <cit> . putative components of stress granules, the exosome, and processing bodies  found in the p. falciparum genome are listed in table  <dig>  it is important to note that few of these proteins have been experimentally validated to associate with granules in plasmodium, and that experimental confirmation of this is certainly warranted. p-bodies are seen in the presence and absence of stress, and the composition of p-bodies is likely independent of the stressor. p-bodies differ from stress granules, as they contain proteins associated with mrna degradation to decap and deadenylate transcripts. there are  <dig> core, canonical p-body proteins that include xrn <dig>  hccr <dig>  dcp <dig>  dcp <dig>  and eif4e, to name a few . in plasmodium, blastp alignments with plasmodium proteins identified predicted orthologues of dcp, rck <dig>  lsm1- <dig>  xrn <dig>  and rap <dig>  . the predicted dcp <dig> and dcp <dig> proteins share homology with the dcp <dig> superfamily domain and the nudix domain, respectively, thus strengthening these assignments. in contrast, no dcps ortholog was identified even with relaxed search parameters. rck, which is also a decapping activator, has been identified in plasmodium. these proteins that likely traffic to cytosolic granules are important to the development and transmission of the parasite. during development of eukaryotes, many mrnas are stored in a translationally repressed state in storage granules like the p- granules in metazoan germ cells. similarly, p. berghei gametocytes produce a p-granule-like storage granule, which contains the rna helicase dozi, the sm-like factor cith, pabps, bruno homolog, the mushashi homolog, and four alba proteins  <cit> . moreover, the dozi complex was found to associate with a substantial portion of the transcripts found in gametocytes  <cit> . the components of this rna granule are highly conserved across plasmodium species.table  <dig> the inferred contents of exosomes, p -bodies, and stress granules in plasmodium species. the composition of rna granules in plasmodium was inferred by conducting blastp queries using the amino acid sequences of components of exosomes, p bodies, and stress granules from model organisms  against known and predicted plasmodium amino acid sequences. other plasmodium proteins that traffic to granules, but that cannot be definitively placed in a currently annotated granule type, are listed separately. gene identifiers for these proteins for three commonly studied malaria species  were obtained from plasmodb.org



rna degradation is largely initiated through the removal of the poly-tail by the deadenylation complex caf1-ccr4-not. in eukaryotes including drosophila, saccharomyces, and homo sapiens, the core caf1-ccr4-not complex is conserved  <cit> . the various subunits of the caf1-ccr4-not complex functionally contribute in different ways, including deadenylation of transcripts, rna processing, nuclear export, translational repression and feeding into the dna damage response  <cit> . through a blastp search, we identified  <dig> potential members of the plasmodium caf1-ccr4-not complex . these predicted members include the scaffold protein not <dig>  the deadenylases caf <dig> and a hccr4-like protein, as well as cnot <dig> and cnot <dig>  which are responsible for ubiquitination and chromatin modifications respectively. only caf <dig> has been genetically characterized in p. falciparum, and genetic disruption of pfcaf <dig> by the piggybac transposon resulted in mistimed expression of transcripts, abnormal expression of merozoite invasion proteins and a slight growth defect in blood stage cultures  <cit> . the caf1-ccr4-not complex is important for tasks ranging from deadenylation to ubiquitination, and may be differentially employed by plasmodium to progress through its complex life cycle.

the eukaryotic exosome consists of multiple subunits and plays an essential role in rna quality control, turnover and processing. the exosome complex has been shown to be important for 3′-to-5′ mrna degradation. in plasmodium we have found eight predicted subunits that align though blastp to common eukaryotic exosome components . rrp <dig> and rrp <dig>  which are the two active exoribonuclease components of the complex in archaeal and eukaryotic cells, are also present. an rbp  with putative function in exosome has been identified, which is a homolog of ddx <dig> in humans or ski <dig> in yeast  <cit> .

transcriptomic analysis of rbps
analysis of the time-course transcriptomes of rbps during malaria parasite development revealed several interesting features . hierarchical clustering and k-means analysis of rna-seq data showed that 44 %  of rbp genes had correlated expression profiles. their expression was detected during early ring stage, peaked at either early and/or late trophozoite, but decreased at early schizont stage . similarly, analysis of the microarray data for intraerythrocytic developmental cycle  showed that 73 %  of rbp transcripts were at their peak expression levels at ring or trophozoite stage. the abundance of most of the rbp transcripts  was suppressed during the schizont stage. this expression pattern is consistent with increased metabolic activities in trophozoites. while 27 %  of rbp genes showed elevated expression at gametocyte stage ii or v, 44 %  of rbp genes had expression in multiple stages. about 24 %  of rbp genes upregulated during the idc stage. it is interesting to note that several genes  with putative or predicted functions in translation or translation regulators have elevated expressions during the gametocyte-stage. confirming previous observations, pfdozi  and pfdhhx  were found to have higher gene expression at gametocyte stage . of the  <dig> rna helicases, five genes are upregulated in ookinetes , whereas others conform to the general transcriptional program with reduced transcription at schizont stage.fig.  <dig> a heatmap of the expression profiles of pfrbps throughout the blood and sexual stages. the expression profiles of the identified rbps is provided with each gene plotted in a single row, and the experimental data for each time point provided as columns . each of the similar expression-profile groups identified in hierarchical clustering is marked with braces on the right of the heatmap



it is noteworthy that of  <dig> single rrm-containing genes ,  <dig> are upregulated at the gametocyte stage. noticeably, pf3d7_ <dig> and pf3d7_ <dig> both lack homologs in model species and showed remarkably specific elevated expression in young and mature gametocytes. pf3d7_ <dig> encodes a putative peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase that interconverts cis- and trans-peptide bonds in the amino acid proline, and it was expressed at higher levels in gametocytes. a plasmodium unique gene, pf3d7_ <dig>  showed higher expression levels at ring and merozoite stages but was virtually undetectable in other stages. most of the  <dig> two-rrm containing genes , however, had a uniform pattern of expression across different life stages of parasite development except for two genes , which had notably higher expression during gametocyte stage.

even though the plasmodium transcriptome generally shows rigid, just-in-time expression patterns and ribosomal profiling demonstrates that the abundance of mrnas correlates with their translational efficiency, many mrnas do not fit within these bounds  <cit> . therefore, assessment of rbp candidates, especially those with an enrichment of mrna levels in a stage-specific manner merit further investigation to determine their downstream roles in gene regulation.

predicted protein-protein interaction network of rbps in plasmodium
because ~40 % of total p. falciparum genes still await functional characterization, prediction of their functions may benefit from high throughput analyses such as coexpression analysis and protein-protein interaction network analysis . similar analyses have been conducted with p. falciparum, which have proven informative  <cit> . based on the available data and protein pull-down analysis of dozi and cith in p. berghei  <cit> , we attempted to construct a protein network for the p. falciparum orthologs using these data along with the yeast-two-hybrid data and interactome information retrieved from the string database with a combinatorial search strategy including co-occurrence, co-expression and text-trimming from published literature . cith and dozi are two important core components of an ancient p-granule in plasmodium that protect quiescent mrna from degradation in gametocytes  <cit> . this complex also contains albas, eif4e, pabp, bruno, mushashi, enolase, and phosphoglycerate mutase. a total of  <dig> interactions were mapped where dozi and cith topped the list with  <dig> and  <dig> interactions, respectively . gene enrichment analysis of hits obtained from the pull-down study revealed possible direct control over cell division, glycolytic pathway and translation. to assess the evolutionary preservation of interacting partners of cith and dozi, we interrogated the interlogous network information available for these genes from the human counterparts. a total of  <dig> interactions  were obtained from the analysis, of which ~ <dig> interactions were common for both human and p. berghei, further confirming an ancient origin and evolutionary conservation of the p-granules .fig.  <dig> predicted protein-protein interaction networks. a a bioinformatically predicted protein interaction network for the pfcith and pfdozi complexes. an interactome network for pfcith and pfdozi is provided, where protein-protein interactions  that provide a larger contribution to the predicted network are represented with larger fonts and nodes. b as in panel a, a predicted caf1-ccr4-not complex interaction network for p. falciparum based on the ppis found in human interactome is illustrated. the major nodes are highlighted with the functional description . note that these interactions warrant experimental confirmation



similarly, we have also constructed an interactome network for another important complex that governs post-transcriptional regulation— the pfcaf1-ccr4-not deadenylation complex . currently there are no studies that have described the composition of this complex in plasmodium species. hence, we utilized published human caf1-ccr4-not complex information to derive corresponding homologs in p. falciparum . following this analysis, the interologous network for human genes were extracted and the final gene set was searched against p. falciparum genome using blastp search at e-value < <dig> . a total of  <dig> interactions were studied, of which  <dig>  have homologs in p. falciparum, suggesting extensive conservation of interacting partners of this complex. channeling these hits further into plasmodb we extracted and enriched gene ontology terms for biological processes. most of the  <dig> predicted proteins of the pf interactome have been categorized under primary metabolic process  that child branches into lipid metabolic process , protein metabolic process , carbohydrate metabolic process , tricarboxylic acid cycle , nucleobase-containing compound metabolic process , and cellular amino acid metabolic process  suggestive of extensive interactions of the complex . the entire protein network analyses in performed in this study are purely based on extrapolation of the information found in human or p. berghei, and hence these data presented here should be interpreted with those qualifiers.

CONCLUSIONS
post-transcriptional regulation is a critical way by which malaria parasite controls its developmental processes, and rbps are basic, underpinning elements in this process. a very few number of pfrbps have been functionally characterized through experimentation, leaving a large portion without functional assignments. about 80 % of the total retrieved  <dig> pfrbps were assigned putative functions using literature search and in silico methods. most of these genes are predicted to be involved in pre-mrna processing  and ribosome biogenesis , and a few have functions in cytosolic granules and as translational regulators. about 50 %  of the  <dig> rbps involved in pre-mrna processing belong to the rrm family, while 55 % of  <dig> rbps participating in ribosome biogenesis are from the rna helicase family, suggesting a large fraction of these rbp families are devoted to these two basic functions. transcriptome analyses of rbps show both stage-specific enrichment of transcripts and mixed-curve expression profiles suggesting involvement of complex cues in their regulation. some of the components of pre-mrna processing and ribosome biogenesis, which are thought to be essential for these basic processes, show stage-specific enrichment of mrna levels. because most pfrbps have no experimentally defined functions, these data may provide a guide to prioritize a subset of genes with an aim to better understand the basic biology of the parasite.
