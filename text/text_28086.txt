BACKGROUND
isoquercitrin, a derhamnosylation product of rutin, has been widely acknowledged with several biological activities, including anti-mutagenesis, anti-virus, anti-hypertensive, anti-proliferative effects, lipid peroxidation, oxidative-stress protection as well as other pharmacological effects . isoquercitrin recently has been proved to exhibit better bioactivity than rutin  <cit> . however, isoquercitrin is rarely found in nature, and therefore it has hardly been isolated. isoquercitrin is structurally similar to rutin that is abundantly present in plant  <cit> . therefore, rutin can be an ideal precursor for preparing isoquercitrin. so far, several methods for the transformation of rutin to isoquercitrin have been investigated, including acid hydrolysis, heating, microbial transformation, and enzymatic transformation techniques  the last of which has become the favored method due to its economic merits, eco-friendly status and applicability to the food industry.

the enzyme α-l-rhamnosidase , which is able to release terminal α-l-rhamnose exclusively from glycosides, glycolipids, and other natural products , is widely distributed in nature and has been purified from animal tissues, plants, yeasts, fungi and bacteria . this enzyme as catalyst has been generally used in a large number of industrial applications. for instance, removing naringin that is the bitter component of grapefruit juices and other citrus juices  <cit> , enhancing the aroma of wines and grape juice  <cit> , studying of the structure of plants and bacterial polysaccharides  <cit> , producing of rhamnose from various natural products  <cit> . furthermore, α-l-rhamnosidase is used not only for the derhamnosylation of natural compounds but also for the reverse rhamnosylation of various small organic compounds  <cit> .

however, the majority of the reported α-l-rhamnosidases are not thermally stable at higher temperatures , which limits their industrial use. therefore, it is necessary to find a proper method to improve the thermal stability of α-l-rhamnosidase with potential industrial roles. the thermostability of an enzyme hinges on multifarious causes, including amino acid composition, metal ions, ph as well as others . currently the thermostability of enzymes can be improved by chemical modification, immobilization, treatment with additives and protein engineering . among them, the effects of additives on the thermostability of the enzyme has received increasing attention from researchers because addition of additives to protein solution and changing its microenvironment provides a simple but practical means of increasing the stability of the enzyme  <cit> . polyhydroxy compound sorbitol is widely used as the enzyme stabilizer  <cit> . different mechanisms have been attributed to the stabilizing effect of sorbitol, which include preferential hydration, preferential exclusion from the denatured protein, and coating effect . however, the effect of sorbitol at the molecular level is not known in detail. it is generally believed that the improvement of the thermostability of the enzyme by sorbitol is due to solvophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds  <cit> .

enhancement of thermal stability is beneficial for most of the biotechnological applications of proteins. however, the recombinant α-l-rhamnosidase of aspergillus terreus has relatively low thermostability   <cit> , which severely limits its industrial application. naturally occurring osmolytes such as amino acids, polyols and salts are known to protect proteins against thermal inactivation by stabilizing the thermally unfolded proteins. in the present investigation, the effect of sorbitol on the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase was studied, and stability properties of the enzyme in the absence and the presence of sorbitol was determined, and the mechanisms responsible for sorbitol improving the thermostability of the enzyme were analyzed. moreover, the effect of sorbitol on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin was investigated. to the best of our knowledge, no report has been published concerning the application of polyhydroxy compound for improving the thermostability of the enzyme so as to enhance the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin.

RESULTS
sorbitol enhanced the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase
from the practical point of view, thermostability is one of the most important characteristics to be considered for applying enzymes in industrial processes  <cit> . therefore, the effects of different concentrations of sorbitol on the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase were determined. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase was increased in the presence of sorbitol ranging in molar concentration from  <dig>  m to  <dig>  m after incubation at 70 °c for 1 h. when the sorbitol concentration was less than  <dig>  m, the thermostability enhancement of α-l-rhamnosidase was significantly increased following the increase of the sorbitol concentration. however, when the sorbitol concentration was more than  <dig>  m, the thermostability enhancement of α-l-rhamnosidase was almost constant, which increased  <dig> % by comparison without sorbitol. it clearly illustrated that  <dig>  m sorbitol concentration is a point of inflection in thermostability enhancement of α-l-rhamnosidase resulted from adding sorbitol, and also it is the maximum peak for the rate of rise based on the increase curve of the α-l-rhamnosidase thermostability, for this reason, our further studies were focused on the reaction system with adding  <dig>  m sorbitol.fig.  <dig> effects of sorbitol, at different concentrations, on the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase at 70 °c. the level of thermostability before each incubation was defined as 100%. each value represents the mean of three independent measurements




stability properties
the thermal stability profile of the presence and absence of sorbitol was determined by incubation during 10 min at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 85 °c. as illustrated in fig. 2a, after addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol, the thermostability of enzyme was increased at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 85 °c. consequently, the value of t <dig> was increased by about 7 °c for α-l-rhamnosidase after addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol.fig.  <dig>

the kinetics of thermal inactivation of the absence of sorbitol was determined by incubating the enzyme at several temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 75 °c during 1 h . the kinetics of thermal inactivation of the presence of sorbitol was also determined by incubating the enzyme at several temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 75 °c during 1 h . the results showed that addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol decreased thermal inactivation rates. the half-life of α-l-rhamnosidase was increased at each temperature after addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol , which prolonged the half-life at 65 °c, 70 °c and 75 °c by  <dig> -fold,  <dig> -fold and  <dig> -fold, respectively. the activation free energy  for thermal denaturation of α-l-rhamnosidase was increased at each temperature after addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol , which increased  <dig>  kj/mol,  <dig>  kj/mol and  <dig>  kj/mol of the activation free energy  at 65 °c, 70 °c and 75 °c, respectively. taking into account the enzyme in the practical application, 70 °c was chose in the following experiment.table  <dig> half-life and activation free energy  of α-l-rhamnosidase with and without  <dig>  m of sorbitol

effect of sorbitol on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin
the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin with sorbitol concentrations of  <dig>  m to  <dig>  m was tested to investigate the effect of different concentrations of sorbitol. as shown in fig. 5a, the addition of  <dig>  m to  <dig>  m of sorbitol did enhance the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin. however, isoquercitrin yield did not increase with an increase in sorbitol concentration. the maximum increase in isoquercitrin yield  was observed at  <dig>  m of sorbitol because a high sorbitol concentration may decrease the mass transfer coefficient so as to reduce the isoquercitrin yield. hence, the optimal sorbitol concentration to add to an enzymatic reaction system was calculated to be  <dig>  m.fig.  <dig> effect of sorbitol on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin. a incubated at 70 °c for 4 h with different concentration of sorbitol in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer at ph  <dig> , 8 mm of rutin, and  <dig>  u/ml of α-l-rhamnosidase;  incubated at 70 °c for 4 h with  <dig>  m of sorbitol in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer at ph range from  <dig>  to  <dig> , 8 mm of rutin, and  <dig>  u/ml of α-l-rhamnosidase;  incubated at 70 °c for 4 h with different concentration of rutin in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer at ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  m of sorbitol, and  <dig>  u/ml of α-l-rhamnosidase;  incubated at 70 °c for up to 12 h with different enzyme concentration without  <dig>  m sorbitol in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer at ph  <dig> , 16 mm of rutin. e incubated at 70 °c for up to 12 h with different enzyme concentration with  <dig>  m sorbitol in disodium hydrogen phosphate-citrate buffer at ph  <dig> , 16 mm of rutin. each value represents the mean of three independent measurements




the effect of a buffer ph range  on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin was investigated. as shown in fig. 5b, the optimal ph of the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin by α-l-rhamnosidase in the absence or presence of sorbitol was  <dig> . the addition of sorbitol enhanced the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin in the buffer ph range of  <dig> – <dig> . furthermore, the enhancements of sorbitol on enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin did not increase with the buffer ph. the addition of sorbitol at a buffer ph of  <dig>  increased isoquercitrin yields by  <dig> %. based on this result, the optimal buffer ph for this enzymatic reaction system was calculated to be  <dig> .

to investigate the effect of substrate concentrations on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin, a substrate concentration range from 8 mm to 20 mm was tested. as shown in fig. 5c, as the concentration of rutin increased, the isoquercitrin concentration increased continuously. however, when the concentration of rutin was higher than 16 mm, the isoquercitrin concentration began to decrease. this result indicates that the substrate concentration plays an important part in the biosynthesis of isoquercitrin. as the substrate concentration increased, substrate inhibition of the reaction gradually became obvious. therefore, the optimal concentration of rutin for isoquercitrin production by α-l-rhamnosidase was calculated to be 16 mm.

to investigate the effects of enzyme concentration and reaction time on the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin in the absence and presence of sorbitol, a range of reaction times, from 2 h to 10 h, was tested. as shown in fig.  <dig>  the isoquercitrin yield in the absence and presence of sorbitol almost always reached the maximum after 10 h of reaction. therefore, the optimal reaction time for the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin was calculated to be 10 h. compared to the absence of additive, the addition of  <dig>  m of sorbitol increased the isoquercitrin yield from  <dig>  to  <dig> %. moreover, the enhancements of isoquercitrin yield increased with the increase of reaction time.

discussion
the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sorbitol on the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus and enzymatic conversion rutin to isoquercitrin, and to analyze the mechanisms through which the stabilization was achieved. in this study, the increases in thermostability increased as the increase of the sorbitol concentration in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  m at 70 °c. however, the enhancement in thermostability was almost constant in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  m. the greatest increase in stability, a  <dig> -fold increase in half-life, was seen at  <dig>  m of sorbitol. the results of stability properties indicated addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol at temperatures ranging from  <dig> to 85 °c enhance the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase. furthermore, the results of the kinetics of thermal inactivation can be inferred that addition of  <dig>  m of sorbitol serves to maintain the active conformation of enzyme after thermal treatment of high temperature ranging from  <dig> to 80 °c  <cit> . the effect of sorbitol on the thermostability of enzymes is not generally predictable. the addition of sorbitol has been reported to be able to increase the thermostability of several enzymes, for example, xylanase from thermomonospora sp.  <cit> , glucose dehydrogenase from haloferax mediterranei.  <cit>  and fungal α-amylase  <cit> . the results place α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus among those enzymes that are stabilized by the addition of sorbitol, and suggest that the addition of sorbitol may make α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus suitable for use in industrial processes.

in this study, the addition of sorbitol enhanced the surface hydrophobicity of α-l-rhamnosidase at 70 °c. the result is consistent with the reports of other researchers , which shows that the sorbitol decreases the direct interaction of water and protein due to the preferential hydration, thereby increasing the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase.

in addition, the fluorescence and cd data suggest that the effects of sorbitol on α-l-rhamnosidase are definite. the measurement of intrinsic protein fluorescence is widely used to investigate the changes of tertiary conformation of proteins, because the fluorescence of internal tryptophan residues is particularly sensitive to various perturbations. the α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus contains  <dig> tryptophan residues. the sharp decreased in fluorescence intensity and red-shift of the fluorescence maximum that accompanied heating of the protein to 70 °c, indicating a shift of these residues to a more hydrophilic environment, was reversed by the addition of sorbitol. the extent of the reversal was in proportion to their ability to increase its thermostability. since these data were relatively easy to obtain and correlated with thermostability, intrinsic fluorescence is considered the simplest predictor of thermostabilizing ability  <cit> . according to cd data, the addition of different concentrations of sorbitol increased the contents of α-helix and β-sheet, but they decreased the content of random coil , which indicated the addition of sorbitol to mixture preserved secondary structures in the protein. the result was consistent with the report of other researcher  <cit> , which could explain why addition of sorbitol could improve the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus.

although there have been many reports about improving thermal stabilization of enzymes by polyols, there is no reports about adding a polyol to improve the yield of enzymatic hydrolysis product. in this study, this is the first time to apply sorbitol to improve the thermostability of the enzyme so as to enhance the enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin. addition of sorbitol slightly decreased the value of k
m and kcat/k
m, however, compared to the absence of additive, the isoquercitrin yield increased by  <dig>  times after addition of  <dig>  m of sorbitol, which was attributed to the addition of sorbitol to improve the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase. the result indicates that the addition of sorbitol to the reaction mixture makes α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus more suitable for use in industrial processes.

CONCLUSIONS
addition of sorbitol enhanced the thermostability of α-l-rhamnosidase from aspergillus terreus at temperatures ranging from 65 °c to 80 °c. half-life and activation free energy with addition of  <dig>  m sorbitol at 70 °c were increased by  <dig> -fold,  <dig>  kj/mol, respectively. moreover, the isoquercitrin yield increased by  <dig> -fold with the addition of  <dig>  m of sorbitol at 70 °c. the results suggest that the reaction system by adding sorbitol has great potential to promote enzymatic conversion of rutin to isoquercitrin production.
