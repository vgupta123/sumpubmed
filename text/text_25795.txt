BACKGROUND
upon pathogen infection, pathogen-associated molecular patterns  such as bacterial flagellin and lipopolysaccharides are recognized by plant receptors to activate pamp-triggered immunity through a mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling cascade  <cit> . gram-negative bacterial pathogens such as pseudomonas syringae can deliver effector proteins to plant cells to interfere pamp-triggered resistance to promote pathogen virulence. as a result, the remaining basal defense is usually insufficient to contain pathogens but can limit their growth in plant tissue. through co-evolution, some effectors may be specifically recognized by plant resistance  proteins and activate strong effector-triggered immunity   <cit> . r gene-activated eti involves a complex defense program including production of reactive oxygen species  and salicylic acid , rapid programmed cell death  and induction of a large number of host genes including pathogenesis-related  genes  <cit> . in arabidopsis, r gene- and sa-mediated defense mechanisms are effective against biotrophic pathogens that feed on living host tissue during the whole or part of their infection cycle  <cit> .

necrotrophic pathogens kill the host to extract nutrients. many necrotrophic pathogens produce toxins, cell wall-degrading enzymes and ros to promote disease and macerate plant tissue  <cit> . plant defense mechanisms against necrotrophic pathogens have been analyzed relatively recently and appear to differ from those against biotrophic pathogens in important ways. first, gene-for-gene resistance is common to biotrophic pathogens but not to necrotrophic pathogens. second, r gene-mediated hr is effective against biotrophic pathogens but does not deter and in some cases actually facilitate infection of necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . third, while sa is important for resistance to biotrophic pathogens, its role in defense against necrotrophic pathogens is limited, if any. in arabidopsis, mutations that impair sa biosynthesis or signaling do not affect resistance to botrytis  <cit> . abolishing sa accumulation in transgenic nahg plants resulted in limited increase in susceptibility to botrytis  <cit> . however, transgenic nahg plants have nonspecific phenotypes  independent of sa  <cit>  and the enhanced susceptibility to botrytis observed in transgenic nahg plants may not be caused by sa deficiency.

although discovered relatively recently, wrky transcription factors are becoming one of the best-characterized classes of plant transcription factors and are at the forefront of research on plant defense responses  <cit> . pathogen infection or treatment with pathogen elicitors or sa induces rapid expression of plant wrky genes. we have shown that in arabidopsis, for example, expression of  <dig> out of  <dig> tested wrky genes was differentially regulated after pathogen infection or sa treatment  <cit> . in addition, a large number of defense or defense-related genes, including well-studied pr genes and the regulatory npr <dig> gene, contain w-box elements in their promoters that are specifically recognized by wrky proteins and are necessary for their inducible expression  <cit> . more recent studies have provided direct evidence for the involvement of specific wrky proteins in plant defense responses. for example, mutations of arabidopsis wrky <dig> enhance plant susceptibility to both biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens including the bacterial pathogen erwinia carotovora as well as fungal pathogens erysiphe cichoracearum and botrytis  <cit> . in addition, wrky <dig> mutants are compromised in both basal and r-gene -mediated resistance to the oomycete hyaloperonospora parasitica  <cit> . arabidopsis wrky <dig> mutants are highly susceptible to necrotrophic pathogens but respond normally to biotrophic pathogens  <cit> . these results indicate that wrky <dig> plays an important and specific role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens. other wrky proteins can function as negative regulators of plant disease resistance. for example, mutations of arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> enhance plant resistance to virulent p. syringae strains  <cit>  and mutations of arabidopsis wrky <dig> enhance tolerance to p. syringae  <cit> . the structurally related wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> function partially redundantly as negative regulators in plant resistance to p. syringae and e. orontii  <cit> . their barley homologues hvwrky <dig> and hvwrky <dig> also function as suppressors of basal defense  <cit> . the diverse roles of wrky proteins may reflect the complex signaling and transcriptional networks of plant defense that require tight regulation and fine-tuning.

we have previously shown that infection of an avirulent p. syringae strain or sa treatment induces arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  which encode two structurally closely related wrky proteins  <cit> . in the present study, we have shown that both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> are nuclear-localized sequence-specific dna-binding proteins. we have also shown that induced expression of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> after pathogen infection or sa treatment was primarily due to plant stress caused by infiltration and spraying of pathogen suspension or sa solution. both loss-of-function t-dna insertion mutants and transgenic overexpression lines for wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> have been generated and examined for responses to the biotrophic bacterial pathogen p. syringae and the necrotrophic fungal pathogen b. cinerea. these studies strongly suggested that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> play a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens but a negative role in resistance to biotrophic pathogens.

RESULTS
structures, dna binding and subcellular localization
based on the number and structure of the wrky zinc fingers, wrky proteins are classified into three groups  <cit> . the first group contains two zinc-finger motifs while the second and third groups contain only one zinc-finger motif. the cys2hiscys zinc finger in the third group of wrky proteins is slightly different from the more common cys2his <dig> zinc finger found in the first and second groups of wrky proteins. wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> belong to group i wrky proteins each with two cys2his <dig> motifs . for group i wrky proteins, the c-terminal wrky zinc finger is responsible for sequence-specific dna binding  <cit> . the nmr solution structure of the c-terminal dna-binding wrky zinc finger of the arabidopsis wrky <dig> protein consists of a four-stranded β-sheet, with a zinc binding pocket formed by the conserved cys2his <dig> residues located at one end of the β-sheet to form a novel zinc and dna binding structure  <cit> . besides the conserved wrky domains, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> share high levels of similarity throughout their whole protein sequences .

most characterized wrky transcription factors recognize the ttgacc/t w-box sequences  <cit> . to examine the dna-binding activity of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  we expressed the genes in e. coli, purified the recombinant proteins, and assayed their binding to an oligonucleotide containing two direct ttgacc w-box repeats  using electrophoretic mobility shifting assays . protein/dna complexes with reduced mobility were detected when purified recombinant wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> protein was incubated with the pchn <dig> probe . binding to a mutant probe  in which the ttgacc sequence was changed to ttgaac was undetectable for wrky <dig> and greatly reduced for wrky <dig> . thus, binding of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> to the ttgacc w-box sequence is highly specific.

to determine the subcellular location of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  we constructed gfp protein fusions of the two wrky proteins at c terminal. the fusion constructs, driven by the camv 35s promoter, were directly bombarded into onion  epidermal cells. the transiently expressed wrky3-gfp and wrky4-gfp fusion proteins were localized exclusively to the nucleus . by contrast, gfp was found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm .

expression
to analyze the role of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in plant defense, we analyzed their expression after pathogen infection. both mock  and botrytis infection resulted in a significant increase in the level of wrky <dig> transcripts . we also investigated its expression after infiltration with a control mgcl <dig> solution  or a suspension of the virulent p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> . as shown in figure 4a, in plants infiltrated with mgcl <dig> or the bacterial suspension, the levels of wrky <dig> transcripts were elevated at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and, to a lesser extent,  <dig> hours post infiltration  relative to that at  <dig> hpi . wrky <dig> transcripts were also rapidly elevated to similar levels after spraying with h2o, defense-inducing molecules sa, methyl jasmonic acid  or 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid , the immediate precursor of ethylene  biosynthesis . thus wrky <dig> responded rapidly to stress conditions generated by liquid infiltration or spraying.

the expression of wrky <dig> was responsive to both mock and botrytis infection but at  <dig> and particularly  <dig> hpi, the levels of wrky <dig> transcripts were higher in botrytis-infected plants than those in mock-infected plants . wrky <dig> was also rapidly induced by infiltrated with either the mgcl <dig> solution or the bacterial suspension. however, in the three rna blotting experiments performed, wrky <dig> transcripts were consistently higher in pathogen-infiltrated plants than those in mgcl2-infiltrated plants . furthermore, the transcript levels of wrky <dig> were consistently higher in sa-treated plants than those in h2o- ja- or acc-sprayed plants. thus, stress-induced expression of wrky <dig> was further elevated by pathogen infection and sa treatment.

response of t-dna insertion mutants to pathogens
to determine the role of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> directly, we identified two independent t-dna insertion mutants for both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  the wrky3- <dig> mutant  contains a t-dna insertion in the second exon while wrky3- <dig>  contains a t-dna insertion in the first exon of the wrky <dig> gene . the wrky4- <dig>  and wrky4- <dig>  mutants both contain a t-dna insertion in the first exon of the wrky <dig> gene . homozygous mutant plants were identified by pcr with wrky3- or wrky4-specific primers. northern blotting analysis showed that wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> transcripts in the respective homozygous mutants were greatly reduced after sa treatment . to determine possible functional redundancy, we also generated wrky3-1/wrky4- <dig> and wrky3-2/wrky4- <dig> double mutants through genetic crossing. the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutants show no difference in growth, development or morphology from wild-type plants. the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutants also responded normally to the virulent pstdc <dig> strain based on the growth of the bacterial pathogen. however, in two of the four experiments, wrky <dig> single mutant and wrky3/wrky <dig> double mutant plants developed significantly less chlorotic disease symptoms than wild-type plants after pstdc <dig> infection, suggesting that wrky <dig> may play a negative role in plant tolerance to the bacterial pathogen.

to determine the role of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> in plant resistance to a necrotrophic pathogen, we analyzed disease development caused by the infection of b. cinerea in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutant plants and compared it with that in wild-type plants. as shown in figure 6a, the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutant plants developed more severe disease symptoms than wild-type plants. to quantify the fungal growth in these plants, we performed northern blotting of total rna isolated from these plants using an actin gene from b. cinerea as probe. like disease symptoms, accumulation of the transcript of the fungal gene was significantly elevated in the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutant plants . these results suggest that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> play a positive role in arabidopsis resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen.

responses of transgenic overexpression lines to pathogens
to further examine the roles of wrky <dig> and wrky <dig>  we generated transgenic arabidopsis plants that constitutively overexpress the wrky genes. constructs containing a full-length wrky <dig> or wrky <dig> cdna driven by the camv 35s promoter were generated and transformed into arabidopsis . northern blotting identified several transgenic plants that contained elevated levels of wrky <dig> transcripts even in the absence of sa treatment . however, wrky <dig> transcripts in the transgenic plants exhibited smear patterns on the rna blot , which could result from premature termination of transcription, alternative splicing and/or degradation of wrky <dig> transcripts. transgenic wrky4-overexpressing lines were also identified, and wrky <dig> transcripts in the overexpression lines were predominantly in a single band of expected size on the rna blot . the transgenic overexpression lines for wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> show no visible alteration in growth, development or morphology from wild-type plants.

to determine possible changes of the overexpression lines in plant disease resistance, we first examined their responses to b. cinerea but found no significant difference in resistance to the fungal pathogen when compared to that of wild-type plants . we then inoculated them with pstdc <dig> and monitored both bacterial growth and disease symptom development. we observed no significant difference between the wrky3-overexpressing lines and wild-type plant in both disease symptom development and the growth of the bacterial pathogen. however, following inoculation with pstdc <dig>  the transgenic wrky <dig> overexpression lines displayed approximately 25– <dig> fold greater bacterial growth than wild-type plants . the inoculated leaves of wrky4-overexpressing plants also developed much more severe disease symptoms than those of wild-type plants after infection . thus overexpression of wrky <dig> greatly enhanced plant susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen.

sa-mediated defense plays a critical role in plant defense against p. syringae  <cit> . sa-mediated defense mechanisms are associated with expression of pr genes including pr <dig> that is often used as a reliable molecular marker for sa-dependent systemic acquired resistance  <cit> . since wrky4-overexpressing plants had higher susceptibility than wild-type plants to p. syringae, we compared the transgenic plants with wild-type plants for pathogen-induced expression of pr <dig>  these analyses revealed no significant pr <dig> transcript accumulation in buffer-treated wild type or wrky4-overexpressing plants . pr <dig> transcripts accumulated to high levels in wild-type plants at both  <dig> and  <dig> day after inoculation  . in the wrky4-overexpressing plants, however, accumulation of pr <dig> transcripts was substantially reduced at both  <dig> and  <dig> dpi when compared to that in wild-type plants . the reduced pr <dig> expression in the wrky4-overexpressing plants is consistent with reduced resistance of the overexpression plants to the bacterial pathogen.

discussion
wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> encode two structurally similar wrky proteins  and their expression was both responsive to stress conditions . stress-induced expression of wrky <dig> but not wrky <dig> was further enhanced by pathogen infection or sa treatment . independent t-dna insertion mutants for both wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> exhibited significantly more severe disease symptom and supported higher fungal growth than wild-type plants after infection by the necrotrophic fungal pathogen b. cinerea . despite the similar structures of the two wrky proteins, however, we observed no significant enhancement in the susceptibility to the fungal pathogen in the wrky3/wrky <dig> double mutant plants relative to the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single mutants . thus there appeared to be little functional redundancy between the two structurally similar wrky proteins in plant resistance to b. cinerea. we observed no major changes of the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> single and double mutants to a virulent p. syringae strain , although a minor reduction in disease symptom development was observed in the wrky <dig> mutants in some of the experiments. on the other hand, overexpression of wrky <dig> greatly reduced susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen based on strong enhancement in both bacterial growth and development of disease symptoms . no such enhancement in susceptibility to the bacterial pathogen was observed in transgenic wrky3-overexpressing lines. the different phenotypes of the transgenic overexpression lines could be due to the distinct roles of the two wrky proteins despite of their similar amino acid sequences. alternatively, wrky <dig> transcripts in the transgenic overexpression lines might not be full-length and, consequently, not functional for production of active wrky <dig> proteins. despite enhanced susceptibility of the wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants to b. cinerea, we observed no increased resistance to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen in either wrky3- or wrky4-overexpressing lines. this might be due to the fact that the col- <dig> wild-type accession, in which the transgenic overexpression lines were produced, is already quite resistant to b. cinerea . these results collectively indicate that wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> play a positive role in plant resistance to botrytis while overexpression of, at least, wrky <dig> has a strong negative effect on plant resistance to p. syringae.

sa-mediated signaling pathways are important for disease resistance to p. syringae, a biotrophic or more precisely hemitrophic pathogen that rely on living plant tissue during its early stages of infection  <cit> . on the other hand, ja/et-mediated defense is important for plant resistance necrotrophic pathogens such as botrytis  <cit> . sa and et/ja signaling pathways are mutually antagonistic  <cit> . as a result, mutations of ja signaling regulators such as coi <dig> and mpk <dig> can enhance sa accumulation and signaling in pathogen-infected plants, resulting in elevated resistance to biotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens. likewise, blocking sa accumulation can promote ja-regulated genes in arabidopsis plants after infection by p. syringae  <cit> . overexpression of wrky <dig> resulted in enhanced plant susceptibility to p. syringae and reduced expression of sa-regulated pr <dig> gene expression . thus wrky <dig> has a negative effect on sa-mediated signaling pathways. on the other hand, wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> play a positive role in ja/et-regulated resistance to necrotrophic pathogens based on the susceptible phenotypes to botrytis . these results strongly suggest that wrky <dig> and perhaps wrky <dig> as well regulate crosstalk between sa- and ja/et-mediated signaling pathways and, as a result, play opposite roles in resistance to the two different types of microbial pathogens.

a number of early studies of wrky transcription factors have suggested their roles in sa-regulated defense responses. many plant wrky genes are induced by biotrophic patogens including avirulent p. syringae in arabidopsis and tobacco mosaic virus  in tobacco that are known to induce sa-dependent sar  <cit> . a reported microarray experiment has revealed that the promoters of genes co-induced with pr <dig> during the development of sar in arabidopsis are enriched in w boxes, suggesting a critical role of wrky transcription factors in induction of sar-associated genes  <cit> . we have previously shown that the w box sequences in the promoter of the npr <dig> regulatory gene required for sa signaling are important for its expression  <cit> . intriguingly, functional analysis of individual wrky genes has so far revealed a different picture about the roles of wrky proteins in sa-mediated defense against biotrophic pathogens. arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> mutants are more susceptible to virulent p. syringae strains than wild-type plants  <cit>  and mutations of arabidopsis wrky <dig> enhance tolerance to p. syringae  <cit> . arabidopsis wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> function partially redundantly as negative regulators in plant resistance to p. syringae and e. orontii  <cit> . their barley homologues hvwrky <dig> and hvwrky <dig> also suppress basal defense  <cit> . we have also previously shown that overexpression of arabidopsis wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> enhances plant susceptibility to p. syringae and suppresses pathogen-induced pr gene expression  <cit> . thus, these characterized wrky proteins function as negative regulators of sa-mediated defense. interestingly, some of these wrky proteins such as wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and redundant wrky <dig>  wrky <dig> and wrky <dig> play a positive role in plant resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . one exception is arabidopsis wrky <dig>  which is shown to regulate the crosstalk by activating sa signaling but suppressing ja-mediated signaling  <cit> . intriguingly, the wrky <dig> mutants, which are expected to be compromised in sa signaling and active in ja signaling, responded normally to p. syringae but exhibited enhanced susceptibility to botrytis  <cit> . therefore, the roles of wrky <dig> in plant defense signaling pathways might be complicated.

CONCLUSIONS
crosstalk between defense signaling pathways is an important mechanism for regulating defense mechanisms against different types of microbial pathogens. although genes capable of regulating the crosstalk have been reported, the underlying mechanisms have not been clearly understood. identification of a number of wrky transcription factors that affect plant resistance in opposite ways to different types of microbial pathogens suggest that the regulation of the crosstalk between these defense signaling pathways occurs at the transcription level. for example, some of these wrky transcription factors may regulate the crosstalk by activating expression of ja/et-regulated genes but repressing sa-regulated genes. such direct and opposite roles in regulation of gene expression would require these wrky transcription factors acting as transcriptional activators or repressors in a gene-specific manner. alternatively, the wrky transcription factors regulate the crosstalk by activating expression of genes associated with ja/et-mediated signaling pathways, including some encoding transcriptional repressor that suppress sa-regulated gene expression. further studies on the transcriptional activation/repression activities and direct transcriptional targets of the wrky proteins could generate important insights into the molecular network of complex plant defense responses to different types of microbial pathogens.
