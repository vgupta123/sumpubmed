BACKGROUND
jasmonic acid  and its metabolites, such as its methyl ester  or amino acid conjugates, all of them commonly named jasmonates, are ubiquitously occurring signaling compounds in plants and are formed in response to biotic and abiotic stress as well as in development  <cit> . jasmonates are lipid-derived compounds synthesized from α-linolenic acid released from plastid membranes and are synthesized by one of seven different branches of the lipoxygenase  pathway  <cit> . lox and the two following enzymatic steps are located in the plastids and involve the action of an allene oxide synthase and an allene oxide cyclase  leading to formation of the intermediate cyclopentenone cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid . further reactions occur in peroxisomes and include the opda reductase  <dig>  and three cycles of fatty acid β-oxidation. within the ja pathway the aoc-catalyzed step is regarded as the crucial step as here the exclusive formation of the enantiomeric form occurring in natural cyclopentanones like ja is facilitated  <cit> . ja can be enzymatically converted into numerous conjugates and derivatives, some of which are biologically active, such as jame  <cit> , cis-jasmone  <cit>  and ja-amino acid conjugates  <cit> . among the latter, -7-iso-jasmonoyl isoleucine  was demonstrated to be the biologically active form of jasmonates by mediating binding of the co-receptor proteins coronatine insensitive <dig>  and jasmonate zim domain   <cit> .

ja-ile is involved in most ja-dependent processes mediated by the f-box protein coi <dig> in a proteasome-dependent manner  <cit> . as evidenced by phenotypic analyses of arabidopsis mutants, jasmonates are involved in various developmental processes, one of them being flower development. the coronatine- and jasmonate-insensitive mutant coi <dig>  <cit>  as well as the ja biosynthesis mutants fad3-2fad7-2fad <dig>  <cit> , dad <dig>  <cit> , opr <dig>  <cit> , and dde <dig>  <cit>  cannot produce viable pollen. all of these mutants exhibit an identical male-sterile phenotype:  anther filaments do not elongate sufficiently to position the locules above the stigma at anthesis,  anthers lack the proper dehiscence of the stomium at the time of flower opening, and  pollen is produced in a smaller amount than in the wild type and does not germinate  <cit> . combining these phenotypic features with the fact that mutants defective in ja perception and/or synthesis have much less water loss in anther tissue than wild type plants, ja has been thought to control dehiscence by regulating water transport into the filament and out of the anthers of arabidopsis  <cit> . moreover, it has been assumed that ja is required for the expression of genes involved in water transport in anthers  <cit> .

similar to the arabidopsis mutant coi <dig>  a mutant impaired in the tomato ortholog of coi <dig> was isolated in a genetic screen for plants that are unable to accumulate defense-related proteins in response to jame application  <cit> . this mutant, called jasmonic acid-insensitive1- <dig>  and identified in a screen of a fast-neutron-mutagenized population of micro-tom plants, exhibits a  <dig> -kb deletion in slcoi <dig>  is deficient in all ja-ile mediated responses and fails to set seeds  <cit> . reciprocal crosses revealed that jai1- <dig> plants are male fertile, but female sterile  <cit> . this is in agreement with data showing that not only ja perception but also ja formation is required for female development: aoc protein occurs specifically in ovules, and opda, ja, and ja-ile accumulate preferentially in the ovary of flower buds, where the levels markedly exceed those detected in non-stressed leaves  <cit> . the organ-specific accumulation of ja and – most importantly – of ja-ile may result in organ-specific regulation of gene expression. indeed, a number of ja-induced genes are specifically expressed within ovules  <cit> , but their regulation by ja in gametophytic organs has not yet been proven.

the ability of jai1- <dig> pollen to induce normal seed set when crossed to a wild type pistillate flower indicates that ja perception and downstream signaling events might not be essential for the production of viable pollen in tomato  <cit> . however, jai1- <dig> plants also exhibit defects in male reproductive function, such as a reduction in pollen viability and germination, tissue collapse and browning of the anther cones, and a protrusion of the stigma from the anther cone of mature flowers  <cit> . therefore, a role of ja in male gametophyte development in tomato is suggested, especially in controlling anther senescence and dehiscence.

dehiscence is typical for maturing stamen  <cit>  and represents a coordinated process occurring in specialized cells of the anther that determine the site of anther opening . this multistage process involves localized cellular differentiation and degeneration to facilitate complete anther opening and pollen release  <cit> . in tobacco, another solanaceae species, the final events of dehiscence, such as degeneration of the stomium cells and dehydration are affected by ethylene   <cit> . treatment of nearly mature anthers with et accelerated dehiscence, whereas an et-perception inhibitor retarded dehiscence, and et-insensitive plants exhibited a loss of anther dehiscence synchrony with flower opening  <cit> . in tomato, overexpression of slerf.b <dig> encoding a dominant repressor variant of the tomato et-response factor , led to a constitutive et response and sensitivity, which was accompanied by the protrusion of stigma from the stamen cone  <cit> . these data suggest a scenario where et acts in stamen development of solanaceae species by regulating stamen dehiscence and pollen release. whether et biosynthesis and function might be changed due to ja insensitivity in jai1- <dig> is an open question and is addressed by this work.

to get insights into the putative role of jasmonates and the mechanisms involved in stamen development, we performed comparative analyses of stamen development in tomato wild type and jai1- <dig> mutant plants in terms of profiling of jasmonates as well as transcript and metabolite profiling. we show that ja levels increased transiently peaking at a middle-bud stage in wild type stamens, whereas they were constantly low in jai1- <dig> stamens. jai1- <dig> stamens are characterized by an enhanced expression of et-regulated genes, higher levels of desiccation-related metabolites and a premature rise of the et precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  starting at the developmental stage of highest ja level in wild type. to further prove these results, application of ja to transgenic plants, which are unable to synthesize ja, and a cross of jai1- <dig> with an et-insensitive mutant  were performed. the data suggest a role of ja as inhibitor of a premature function of et, which itself regulates anther dehiscence and pollen release.

RESULTS
wild type stamens at stage  <dig> contain highest level of ja and ja-ile
senescence of anther cones is a prominent phenotypic feature of jai1- <dig> flowers  <cit> . to get insights into the processes leading to this stamen phenotype, flower development of jai1- <dig> plants and the corresponding wild type was analyzed. timing of flower development in wild type  and jai1- <dig> mutant plants was highly similar. after five weeks of cultivation, the first open flower appeared at the oldest inflorescence and younger flower buds of different stages were visible simultaneously . the flower bud stages were classified in developmental stages using parameters such as bud size, opening of the sepals and color of the petals. the youngest stage  represented a small bud completely enclosed by sepals, whereas the oldest stage  represented the open flower showing bright yellow petals. the stamen cone of jai1- <dig> mutant open flowers frequently showed a dehiscent and senescent tip , whereas stamens of other developmental stages did not show obvious phenotypic differences to wild type stamens.figure  <dig> classification of stages and levels of jasmonates in developing stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>   inflorescences of wild type and jai1- <dig> showing the six developmental stages defined for this study.  developmental stages of dissected stamen cones of wild type and jai1- <dig>   jasmonate levels in developing stamens. stamens of the respective stages were extracted and contents of opda, ja, and ja-ile were determined. mean values ± sd are shown. data of the same developmental stage were compared between wild type and jai1- <dig> by student’s t-test . ja, jasmonic acid; ja-ile, ja-isoleucine; opda, cis-12-oxo-phytodienoic acid; sd, standard deviation.



to elucidate the occurrence of jasmonates in male reproductive organs, stamens were collected from each developmental stage of wild type and jai1- <dig> plants and the levels of opda, ja and ja-ile were determined . the opda content was similar in all stages and did not differ significantly between wild type and jai1- <dig>  this contrasts to the levels of ja and ja-ile, which both exhibited a significant maximum in wild type stamens at stage  <dig> and dropped down to levels below the detection limit in stamens of open flowers . most importantly, the levels of ja and ja-ile were almost below the detection limit in jai1- <dig> stamens of all developmental stages. thus, in addition to the ja insensitivity, stamens of jai1- <dig> plants are characterized by an absence of active jasmonates possibly caused by the missing positive feed-back in ja biosynthesis and ja-induced gene expression known for developmental processes  <cit> . as a result, the ja insensitivity might lead to severe alterations in transcript and metabolite accumulations in stamens of jai1- <dig> in comparison to wild type.

jasmonate-insensitivity alters the transcriptome in stamens
to elucidate the role of jasmonates in stamen development, transcript profiling was conducted for stamens of developmental stages characterized by maximum differences in ja/ja-ile contents. rna isolated from dissected stamens of stages  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of both genotypes was used for hybridization of agilent tomato arrays. to find ja-regulated genes, the agilent data were quantile-normalized and analyzed using the arraystar software as described in the methods section. the comparison between stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig> in each developmental stage revealed  <dig> genes to be differentially expressed in stamens of both genotypes . most of the identified genes showed stage-specific differential expression. only a minor part of genes appeared to be differentially expressed in two or three developmental stages. moreover, a strong correlation between the number of differentially regulated genes and the ja/ja-ile levels was found. the highest number of regulated genes was detected in stage  <dig> showing the highest ja/ja-ile levels in wild type . it turned out that most of the differentially expressed genes occurring in sections  <dig>  1 +  <dig>  and 1 + 3 +  <dig> of the venn diagram exhibited lower expression levels in jai1- <dig>  pointing to a positive regulatory role of jasmonates in early stamen development. this contrasts to the genes occurring exclusively in stage  <dig> and  <dig>  in which most of them exhibited higher expression levels in jai1- <dig> than in wild type  stamens . here, a predominantly negative regulatory role of jasmonates in the later stages of stamen development is suggested.figure  <dig> comparative analysis of transcript accumulation in stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>  total rna isolated from three developmental stages of stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig> was subjected to transcript profiling using the agilent-tomato 44 k-full genome chip.  venn diagram showing the number of significantly regulated genes . numbers in parentheses are related to genes with unknown functions. note that the highest number of differentially regulated genes was found in stage  <dig>   classification of differentially expressed genes according to functional classes. the bold numbers indicate how many genes in total were differentially regulated in the respective developmental stage, whereas the regular numbers show how many of them exhibited increased transcript levels in wild type  or jai1- <dig> . light red and light blue colors mark the overall tendency of differential transcript accumulation in each developmental stage/functional class .  grouping of max-normalized differentially regulated genes according to their kinetics during development. the mean  of all genes belonging to the respective group is shown, for details of differentially expressed genes within the groups see figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  fourteen groups were generated by application of the following criteria: stage-specificity according to the venn diagram , iv-ix:  <dig> , x-xiv: 3 +  <dig>   <dig> ), higher expression levels in at least one developmental stage of wild type  or jai1- <dig> , and kinetics of transcript levels . the arabic numbers show the number of differentially regulated genes in each group.



the differentially expressed genes were assigned to  <dig> groups according to their transcript levels in wt and jai1- <dig> and to their kinetics over the three stages analyzed . the majority of genes were classified into groups ii, v and viii showing decreasing transcript levels during stamen development, and into groups vi and ix showing transient increase or decrease at stage  <dig>  note that especially for groups ii and v, the ja responsiveness was stronger in the stage before reaching the maximum of jasmonate levels. genes in groups vi and ix have opposite profiles of transcript accumulations between wt and jai1- <dig> peaking at stage  <dig>  which shows the maximum ja/ja-ile levels in wt stamens . among the positively ja-regulated genes were well-described ja-responsive genes, such as jaz <dig> , jaz <dig>  and jaz <dig>   <cit> . transcript accumulation of these genes was validated by quantitative rt-pcr using rna from all defined developmental stages of stamen of an independent experiment . transcript levels of all three genes exhibited a transient maximum at stage  <dig> correlating with the maximum ja/ja-ile levels. the gene encoding the ja biosynthetic enzyme aoc, however, did not show a differential regulation between wt and jai1- <dig>  pointing to a preferentially developmental regulation of its expression. this is reflected by the level of opda, which was not significantly different between wt and jai1- <dig> .

all identified differentially expressed genes could be assigned to  <dig> functional classes . the highest numbers of differentially expressed genes occurred in the classes ‘transcription factors and regulators’ , ‘signaling’ , ‘defense’  and ‘secondary metabolism’ . this coincides with a putative role of jasmonates due to the well-described functions of jasmonate-induced genes  <cit> . additionally, genes encoding lipid transfer proteins, peptide transporters and udp glucosyltransferases were among the positively ja-regulated genes showing a diminished expression in early stamens  of jai1- <dig> in comparison to wt . their putative gene products might be involved in pollen nutrition.

therefore, pollen morphology and development was analyzed using cross sections of chemically fixed and embedded stamens . in the wt stamen at stage  <dig>  late unicellular microspores were detected showing small vacuoles . pollen at bud stage  <dig> was in the bicellular stage and exhibited a large central vacuole . simultaneously, the tapetum started to degrade. at stage  <dig>  all pollen grains showed a high number of starch grains, and the vacuoles had disappeared . during the following stages, starch appeared to be degraded and the cytoplasm reached a glassy state . in jai1- <dig> stamens, however, different developmental pollen stages were detectable simultaneously and the development of microspores and pollen occurred faster than in wt stamens. the morphological features described for the wt appeared at least one stage earlier. central vacuoles and starch grains appeared in pollen of stage  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and the cytoplasm was in the glassy state already at stage  <dig> . most importantly, the tapetum was not detectable in stage  <dig> accompanied by a high number of aborted pollen at the final stage of the development . the abnormal morphology of pollen of jai1- <dig> supports the assumption drawn from transcript data that jasmonates are important for the timing of pollen development and might affect the nutrient supply of developing pollen.figure  <dig> pollen development in wild type and jai1- <dig>  semi-thin cross-sections of anthers of wild type  and jai1-1

searching the differentially expressed genes for candidates that might have regulatory functions in late stamen development, genes related to et-dependent processes stood out . among these, genes encoding the following classes of proteins were identified: et-related tfs acting as ‘master regulators’ such as rin-mads tf  and mads-fruitfull tf <dig> , enzymes involved in et biosynthesis such as 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid  synthase  <dig>  and acc oxidase-like , proteins involved in et signaling such as ap2/erf domain containing tf  and et receptor  <dig>  as well as et-induced proteins such as mitochondrial alternative oxidase aox1b , pirin-like protein , dehydrin dhn <dig>  and endoglucanase  <dig> .

for a validation of these selected candidates, we used a new set of plants and all defined developmental stages of stamen to determine their relative transcript levels by quantitative rt-pcr . transcript levels of all selected genes were at the detection limit at early developmental stages of wt stamens and started to rise earliest in stage  <dig>  or stage  <dig> . in stamens of jai1- <dig>  however, these transcripts were detected at earlier stages and to higher levels. these data suggest that the absence of ja/ja-ile and/or jasmonate signaling in jai1- <dig> stamen might lead to an early or premature et biosynthesis and action and subsequently might contribute to the early senescence and dehiscence observed in stamen of jai1- <dig> figure  <dig> transcript accumulation pattern of ethylene-related genes in developing stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>  relative transcript levels of genes encoding et-related tfs acting as ‘master regulators’ , et biosynthetic enzymes , proteins involved in et-signaling , and of et-response genes . all transcript levels were determined by rt-qpcr and set in relation to sltip <dig>  the inset in each diagram visualizes the signal intensity obtained from microarray analysis. mean values ± sd are shown. data of the same developmental stage were compared between wild type and jai1- <dig> by student’s t-test . et, ethylene; sd, standard deviation.



jasmonate-insensitivity alters the steady state levels of soluble metabolites in stamens
metabolite profiling was performed using stamens of stage  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  which were collected and subjected to non-targeted metabolite profiling. by analyzing polar compounds using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy , we could detect about  <dig> compounds showing significantly different levels in stamens of wt and jai1- <dig> in at least one developmental stage . from these, around two thirds could be assigned to known substance classes . most of the differential compounds were detectable in stage  <dig> , which had the highest ja levels in wild type stamens. comparing the levels of the identified compounds, it became obvious that in stage  <dig> most of them exhibited a lower content in jai1- <dig> than in wt, whereas differentially occurring compounds in stamens of stages  <dig> and  <dig> showed higher levels in jai1- <dig> .figure  <dig> comparative steady-state analysis of soluble metabolites in stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>  soluble metabolites were extracted from stamens of three developmental stages and analyzed by non-targeted metabolite profiling. levels of metabolites were compared between wild type and jai1- <dig> in each developmental stage.  venn diagram showing the number of metabolites accumulating in significantly different amounts in wild type and jai1- <dig> stamens . note that the highest number of differentially occurring metabolites was found in stage  <dig>   classification of differentially occurring metabolites according to their chemical nature. numbers in bold indicate how many metabolites occurred in different amounts in total in the respective developmental stage, whereas the small numbers show how many metabolites of them exhibited increased levels in wild type  or jai1- <dig> . light red and light blue colors mark the overall tendency of differential accumulation in each developmental stage/substance class .  grouping of max-normalized metabolites according to their kinetics during development. the mean  of all metabolites belonging to the respective group is shown, for details of differentially occurring metabolites see figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  the following criteria were applied for building groups: higher accumulation according to the venn diagram in at least one developmental stage of wild type  or jai1- <dig> , and kinetics of metabolite levels . the arabic numbers show the number of metabolites in each group. note that most metabolites show an accumulation during stamen development. sd, standard deviation.



six different groups of metabolites were defined according to the different levels in wt and jai1- <dig> stamens and to their kinetics during development from stage  <dig> to stage  <dig> . only a few metabolites exhibited a decrease during development or a transient increase peaking at stage  <dig>  whereas nearly 80% of the identified metabolites belonged to groups i and iv showing an accumulation during development. among them, about 60% of metabolites showed higher levels in jai1- <dig> than in wt stamens . in group iv, mainly sugars, sugar acids and amino acids were found. as exemplified for selected monosaccharides , di- and trisaccharides , sugar alcohols , and amino acids , these metabolites showed low levels in wt stamens at stage  <dig>  followed by a slight change at stage  <dig> and a moderate increase at stage  <dig> . in jai1- <dig> stamens, however, some of them already showed higher levels at stage  <dig>  many of them showed high levels at stage  <dig>  and all of them increased drastically at stage  <dig> resulting in contents up to six-fold higher than those in wt stamens at this stage . photometric measurements of glucose, fructose and sucrose performed for all six defined developmental stages confirmed the data obtained by metabolite profiling and revealed a continuous accumulation of these sugars in stamens of jai1- <dig> resulting in significantly higher levels than in wt stamen . this contrasts to sugar phosphates, which accumulated over development in wt stamens, but exhibited lower levels in jai1- <dig> stamens .

taken together, the enhanced content of sugars as well as amino acids known as protective compounds in response to osmotic stress  <cit>  points to increasing water loss attributing to the premature dehiscence in jai1- <dig> stamens. interestingly, the higher levels of osmotically active compounds coincided with a higher osmolality of the cellular fluid in jai1- <dig> stamens . in all developmental stages, jai1- <dig> stamens exhibited a significantly increased osmolality, reaching at stage  <dig> about twice the levels measured in wt stamens. this was accompanied by a diminished accumulation of starch in stamens of jai1- <dig> in comparison to wt stamens as visualized by staining of fresh sections .figure  <dig> premature dehiscence in stamens of jai1- <dig>   osmolality in stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig> plants.  occurrence of starch in anther tissues of wild type and jai1- <dig> plants. sections of fresh stamens were stained with iodine potassium iodide resulting in a black and brownish coloration of amylose and amylopectin, respectively. note the strong staining in stamen of wild type plants showing a high number of starch grains and high levels of amylopectin, whereas stamen of jai1- <dig> show only a few starch grains and almost no amylopectin. bar represents 100 μm for all micrographs.  relative water content in stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>   cross-sections of fresh stamens of the six developmental stages in wild type and jai1- <dig>  note the appearance of fluids in the locule of wild type stamen at stage  <dig> and  <dig>  being absent in jai1- <dig>  in contrast, jai1- <dig> pollen appear whitish  at early developmental stages pointing to premature pollen desiccation and accumulation of desiccation-related substances. mean values + sd of stamens of the developmental stages indicated are shown in  and . *p ≤ <dig> , ***p ≤ <dig>  according to student’s t-test . sd, standard deviation.



jasmonate-insensitivity alters ethylene production and function in stamens
the transcriptome and metabolite data indicate an early rise in et levels in stamen of jai1- <dig>  therefore, the content of its precursor acc was determined in stamens of wt and jai1- <dig> . indeed, the rise in acc occurred in jai1- <dig> at least one stage earlier than in wt stamens and is highly correlated to the expression profiles of et biosynthesis and et response genes . altogether, this points to a premature et biosynthesis and signaling in jai1- <dig> stamens that in wt stamen might be down-regulated by jasmonates.figure  <dig> levels of acc in developing stamens of wild type and jai1- <dig>  stamens of the respective stages were extracted and content of acc was determined. mean values ± sd are shown. data of the same developmental stage were compared between wild type and jai1- <dig> by student’s t-test . acc, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid; sd, standard deviation.



to verify this hypothesis, we applied ja to developing flower buds of tomato. since wt stamen already contain high levels of ja/ja-ile , which might be sufficient for down-regulation of et-related genes, transgenic micro-tom plants expressing an slaoc-rnai construct under control of the 35s promoter were used  <cit> . these plants are characterized by diminished ja levels and exhibit a jai1-1-like phenotype. repeatedly performed application of ja to wt flower buds starting at stage  <dig> resulted in enhanced transcript levels of ja-regulated genes in stamen of stage  <dig> . in stamen of slaoc-rnai, however, a significant down-regulation of selected et-related genes, such as those encoding acs <dig>  aco, erf- <dig> and aox1b, was detected . this down-regulation of et related transcripts points to a negative regulatory role of ja in late stamen development.figure  <dig> transcript accumulation of selected ja-responsive and et-related genes in stamens of ja-treated flowers buds. flower buds in stage  <dig> were treated three times in an interval of 20 hours by spraying with ja solution in the concentration indicated. stamens were harvested from flower buds at stage  <dig> .  relative transcript levels of genes encoding early ja-induced genes in stamen of wild type plants.  relative transcript levels of genes encoding et biosynthetic enzymes, proteins involved in et-signaling, and of et-response genes in stamen of aoc-rnai plants. all transcript levels were determined by rt-qpcr and set in relation to sltip <dig>  mean values + sd are shown. data of ja treated stamen were compared with stamen of control treatment  by student’s t-test . et, ethylene; ja, jasmonic acid; sd, standard deviation.



to prove the hypothesis that ja insensitivity accompanied by premature et action leads to early dehiscence, water content in developing stamens was determined . wild type stamens showed increasing water content up to stage  <dig> followed by a slight, but constant loss of water until anther maturation . in contrast, jai1- <dig> stamens did not show increasing water content in stage  <dig> and exhibited a much stronger water loss during further development resulting in a maximum difference to wt at stage  <dig>  cross sections of fresh stamen cones revealed that stamens of wt flower buds of stages  <dig> and  <dig> exhibited a high amount of locular fluid filling the space between developing pollen grains . this fluid was nearly absent in jai1- <dig> anthers of the same developmental stage correlating with the differences in water content. consistently, the premature dehiscence is reflected also by premature pollen release from jai1- <dig> stamens tested by shaking anthers followed by counting the released pollen . only a few pollen were released from wt stamens at stage  <dig> and the majority of pollen was released in stage  <dig>  whereas pollen release in jai1- <dig> started already in stage  <dig>  this is also reflected by the closed stomia of wt stamen at stage  <dig>  whereas they are already opened in jai1- <dig> stamen at the same stage . in summary, the lower water content, the absence of fluid in the locule of developing stamens, and the premature release of pollen in jai1- <dig> point to a deregulated function of et in control of water content and dehiscence of tomato stamens not only in the mature stage, but already during development of the flower bud.figure  <dig> pollen release from anthers of wild type, jai1- <dig> and mutants affected in et-signaling. dissected anthers of the developmental stage 4s ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of wild type , jai1- <dig>  never ripe , epinastic  and the double mutant jai1- <dig> nr were shaken in pbs and released pollen were counted. the overproduction of et in epi resulted in similar premature pollen release at stage  <dig> as detectable for jai1- <dig>  whereas pollen release in nr and jai1- <dig> nr is similar to wt. note that the absolute numbers of released pollen are less in jai1-1-based genotypes due to the high number of aborted pollen . mean values + sd are shown . different letters designate statistically different values . anova, analysis of variance; et, ethylene; hsd, honest significant difference; sd, standard deviation.



to test this, pollen release in mutants affected in et perception, such as never ripe  or showing a constitutive et response, such as epinastic , both in the micro-tom background  <cit> , was determined in comparison to wt and jai1- <dig> . consistent with et function in senescence and dehiscence, nr anthers exhibited a delayed pollen release, whereas epi anthers showed a premature pollen release. here, similar to jai1- <dig>  released pollen were already detectable in epi stamen of stage  <dig>  whereas almost no pollen were released from stamen of wt and nr in this stage. this leads to the conclusion that jasmonate-insensitivity in jai1- <dig> mimics the constitutive et response in the epi mutant.

as genetic proof, jai1- <dig> and nr were crossed and stamens of the double mutant were analyzed regarding pollen development and release. as visible in semi-thin cross sections of jai1- <dig> nr anthers, pollen development at early stages was similar to that of the jai1- <dig> single mutant . the development of microspores and pollen occurred faster than in wt and nr stamens and the tapetum was degraded in stage  <dig>  from these data we conclude that at early stages, which are not related to et function, jai1- <dig> dominates nr and introduction of et insensitivity did not change the jai1- <dig> phenotype. however, a contrasting picture appeared at late stages of stamen development. here, et insensitivity rescued the jai1- <dig> phenotype. pollen release and closure of stomium of the double mutant at stage  <dig> is similar to nr . the data obtained by these approaches support the assumption that jasmonates function as inhibitors of premature rise of et during stamen development in wt tomato.

discussion
jasmonates, known as stress hormones, are also involved in the regulation of various developmental processes of plants. jasmonates are crucial for plant fertility, since ja deficiency or insensitivity in a. thaliana results in male sterility characterized by delayed anther dehiscence, insufficient filament elongation and production of unviable pollen  <cit> . in contrast, ja insensitivity in tomato leads to a female sterile phenotype, although the development of stamen and pollen is also affected  <cit> . therefore, jai1- <dig> stamens provide a useful tool for identifying ja and coi1-dependent processes that operate in male reproductive tissues of tomato. comparing jai1- <dig> and wt stamens in terms of gene expression and metabolite accumulation, this study revealed that jasmonates regulate pollen nutrition and thereby pollen development, but most obviously they are an important regulator of the proper timing of stamen dehiscence via a temporal repression of et biosynthesis and action.

in developing stamens of wt plants, ja and ja-ile levels exhibited a maximum at an intermediate developmental stage , which was defined as buds of maximal size with opened sepals, but white petals. at this stage, stamens undergo a switch between the two developmental phases characterized as the histodifferentiation program  and cell degeneration and dehiscence program   <cit> . up to flower bud stage  <dig>  developing pollen grains finished pollen mitosis, took up water and sugars from locular fluid and started to accumulate starch . the maximum jasmonate level coincided with the number of differentially accumulating transcripts in wt and jai1- <dig> stamens. in stages before reaching the ja maximum, that is, during phase i of stamen development, most of the differentially regulated genes exhibited higher transcript accumulation in wt than in jai1- <dig> stamens , indicating a positive regulatory role of jasmonates in phase i. additionally, gene expression analysis revealed that positive regulation by ja appeared to be stronger in stages before reaching jasmonate maximum. interestingly, this group contains genes, whose putative gene products might be responsible for pollen nutrition and water homeostasis in pollen and anther tissue. these alterations in expression pattern of jai1- <dig> stamens were accompanied by reduced metabolite levels, but also by a premature degradation of the tapetum, a high number of aborted pollen and the absence of locular fluid .

formation of viable pollen within the locules of the anther is dependent on nutritive contributions from the surrounding sporophytic tissue, and pollen development relies on the nutritive support of neighboring tapetal cells  <cit> . developing microspores obtain their carbohydrate supply from the tapetum  <cit>  and from degradation of callose surrounding the microspore tetrads  <cit> . during maturation, pollen grains receive their sugars directly from the locular fluid, since at the later stages of anther development the tapetum no longer exists  <cit> . the locular fluid contains large amounts of soluble compounds as a result of polysaccharide degradation  <cit> . however, premature death of tapetal cells results usually in the disruption of the nutrient supply to the microgametophytes, leading to their death  <cit> . therefore, the premature degradation of the tapetum and the absence of the locular fluid in jai1- <dig> stamens may contribute to an inefficient pollen nutrition followed by abortion of microspores as well as by an accelerated and inefficient maturation of the remaining pollen. the diminished formation of vacuoles in pollen of jai1- <dig> plants  might point to such an insufficient water and sugar uptake since both processes are assumed to be linked  <cit> .

a different scenario was obtained upon transcript and metabolite profiling of stamens in phase ii of development. in stages after the ja maximum, most of the differentially regulated genes appeared to be expressed at higher levels in jai1- <dig> than in wt stamen implicating a negative regulatory role of ja. most prominently, transcripts of genes involved in et biosynthesis , et signaling  and et-response genes  exhibited higher levels in jai1- <dig>  this was accompanied by a higher content in the et precursor acc, whose levels increased at least one stage earlier in jai1- <dig> than in wt stamens. accordingly, some of the genes were down-regulated by application of ja to flower buds of a slaoc-rnai line  supporting the hypothesis that jasmonates control biosynthesis and function of et in a negative way.

among the et response genes were genes encoding polysaccharide degrading enzymes, such as endoglucanase  <dig> . this is in line with the fact that hydrolytic enzymes and proteins linked to cell wall loosening are thought to be involved in anther dehiscence  <cit> . along with that, osmotic active metabolites, such as proline, non-reducing sugars, such as sucrose, trehalose and 1-kestose, as well as protective proteins, such as dehydrin, were found to be accumulating in higher amounts in jai1- <dig> than in wild type stamen . the higher hexose levels in jai1- <dig> stamens might arise from an insufficient conversion of starch from sugars. indeed, less starch was found in the anther tissues of jai1- <dig> stamens than in anthers of wt stamens, where a maximum of starch accumulation was detected in stage  <dig> and possibly resulted in a chemical formation of water . in turn, higher glucose and fructose contents in the jai1- <dig> might also function as osmoprotectants to compensate the loss of water released upon starch biosynthesis. together, this could result in an increased dehydration within specific cell types and regions of the anther . certainly, the stomia of jai1- <dig> stamens exhibited a premature rupture  contributing to the early pollen release.

the enhanced expression of et-related genes and the early accumulation of acc in jai1- <dig> stamens suggest that a premature rise and action of et occur in stamens of jai1- <dig> and leads to dehiscence and pollen release. this is consistent with the delayed and premature pollen release observed in stamen of the tomato mutants nr and epi, respectively , thereby supporting the role of et in dehiscence and pollen release . most importantly, the genetic proof by creating the double mutant jai1- <dig> nr showed unequivocally that et insensitivity led to a rescue of the phenotype of jai1- <dig> stamen at late developmental stages , but not at early stages . this supports the hypothesis that jasmonates have a positive regulatory role at phase i of stamen development, which is not related to et, whereas jasmonates are necessary to prevent the early rise and action of et in phase ii regulating senescence and dehiscence.

et and ja are found to be coordinately  regulated or exhibit opposite effects on many plant responses  <cit> . a synergistic cross-talk between ja and et is known to occur preferentially for the response to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> , whereas they act antagonistically in regulation of the expression of wound-responsive genes  <cit>  and metabolite biosynthetic genes  <cit> . furthermore, jasmonates repress apical hook formation  <cit> , while et has the opposite effect  <cit> . in arabidopsis, ja and et act in parallel to regulate timing of floral organ abscission  <cit> . depending on developmental stages and physiological responses, ja affects et signaling downstream of the et receptors, since reduced ja levels might cause et sensitivity in originally et insensitive ein <dig> mutants  <cit> . recently, a model for the molecular mechanism for the antagonism between ja and et signaling in the apical hook formation in a. thaliana was presented  <cit> : on the one hand, myc <dig>  a prominent member of the myc-transcription factor-family activated by ja, can physically interact with the et-activated transcription factor ethylene insensitive <dig>  to directly inhibit its transcriptional activity. on the other hand, myc <dig> positively regulates expression of ein <dig> binding f-box protein <dig>  by directly binding to its promoter leading to an increase in ebf1-promoted ein <dig> degradation. however, applying strong statistical criteria neither myc <dig> nor ebf <dig> were found among the differentially regulated genes in our dataset from tomato stamen.

CONCLUSIONS
the characteristic phenotypic feature of jai1- <dig> flowers is a premature dehiscence and senescence of stamens visible by browning of the cone tip  <cit>  leading to the hypothesis that function of the senescence-promoting hormone et might be deregulated in this mutant. obtained by global transcript and metabolite profiling, the presented data reveal a new scenario for the function of jasmonates and et in the stamen development of tomato . during early stamen development jasmonates seem to promote processes related to pollen nutrition and water supply. in the later developmental stages, ja insensitivity in the jai1- <dig> mutant leads to a premature expression of some of the well-known master regulators in et signaling, thereby leading to premature biosynthesis and action of et.figure  <dig> schematic model of the role of jasmonates in stamen development of tomato. jasmonate levels increase transiently during stamen development. in the first phase, increasing ja levels promote pollen nutrition and development. in the second phase of stamen development, jasmonates function as inhibitor of a premature rise of ethylene, which itself positively regulates anther dehiscence and pollen release.



the premature dehiscence of jai1- <dig> stamen is in contrast to the known effects of ja deficiency or insensitivity in a. thaliana, where in the corresponding mutants dehiscence of anthers appears to be delayed. in developing flowers of arabidopsis wt plants, the highest ja levels occurred in the mature flower  <cit> , and ja is absolutely required in stamen of flower stage  <dig> to enable filament elongation in the subsequent developmental stage  <cit> . this confirms a function of ja as a positive regulator in arabidopsis to trigger the developmental switch that initiates the program for final stamen maturation and dehiscence. in tomato, however, the ja/ja-ile content already started to decline at a stage before the desiccation process starts. therefore, it is likely that jasmonates are not directly involved in the regulation of dehiscence of tomato anthers, but fulfill a regulatory role by controlling the dehiscence-promoting hormone et to prevent a premature occurrence of this process. with this model, a new form of cross-talk between ja and et in a plant developmental process becomes obvious. the elucidation of regulatory components that mediate this cross-talk will deliver new insights into the regulatory role of ja and et in the development of tomato stamen.
