BACKGROUND
besides aquifex, thermotoga are the only group of bacteria that can grow up to 90°c. isolates of thermotoga have been discovered from heated sea floors  <cit> , continental hot springs  <cit> , and oil fields  <cit> . analysis of their 16s rrna sequences have positioned thermotoga spp. to a deep branch of the tree of life, suggesting that these strict anaerobes emerged at an early stage of evolution, when the surface of the earth was hot and its atmosphere contained little oxygen. study of the molecular genetics of thermotoga is expected to shed light on the fundamental questions related to the origin of life as well as the mechanisms of the thermostability of macromolecules under extreme conditions. most importantly, thermotoga hydrolyze a number of polysaccharides through fermentative catabolism and produce hydrogen gas as one of the final products  <cit> . this has stimulated tremendous interest in utilizing these bacteria to produce biomass-based clean energy, especially through metabolic engineering approaches. however, due to the lack of genetic tools, the investigations of thermotoga are still largely limited to biochemical, genomic, and fermentative studies, as with most hyperthermophiles.

cryptic mini-plasmids prq <dig>  pmc <dig>  and prku <dig> have been identified in t. sp. rq <dig>  <cit> , t. maritima  <cit> , and t. petrophila rku- <dig>  <cit> , respectively. although discovered at geologically unrelated locations, the three plasmids are nearly identical. they are extremely small  and encode just one apparent open reading frame, presumably the replication protein. studies of prq <dig> suggest that the plasmid is negatively supercoiled and replicates by a rolling-circle mechanism  <cit> . based on prq <dig>  two thermotoga-e. coli shuttle vectors pjy <dig>  and pjy <dig>  have been constructed for expression in t. neapolitana and t. maritima, respectively  <cit> . through liposome-mediated transformation, both vectors rendered transient antibiotic resistance to thermotoga cells in liquid media, but no transformants could be isolated from plates. to date, that report remains the only documented effort of expressing heterologous genes in thermotoga, out of more than  <dig> publications retrieved from pubmed using "thermotoga" as the key word . in fact, genetic manipulation of thermotoga remains a challenge. to develop a tractable gene transfer system for thermotoga spp., we systematically examined every aspect pertaining to the cloning and expression of foreign genes in thermotoga, from plating efficiency to vector stability. we demonstrate that heterologous genes can be introduced to thermotoga through multiple means, be functionally expressed, and be stably maintained.

methods
strains and growth conditions
bacterial strains and vectors involved in this study are listed in table  <dig>  e. coli dh5α was used as the host strain for the construction of vectors and was grown at 37°c in luria broth , with  <dig> % agar for plates. ampicillin was supplemented at  <dig> μg ml- <dig> when needed. thermotoga neapolitana atcc  <dig>  was purchased from atcc http://www.atcc.org/, and strains t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima msb <dig> were kindly provided by dr. harald huber, university of regensburg, germany. thermotoga were cultivated at 77°c in svo medium developed by van ooteghem et al.  <cit> . fifty milliliters of svo was dispensed into  <dig> ml serum bottles and sparged with nitrogen gas to remove oxygen from the medium and the headspace. serum bottles were then sealed by rubber stoppers, secured by aluminum caps, and sterilized. inoculation of the liquid svo was done by a syringe needle with a typical inoculum of 2%. liquid cultures were shaken at  <dig> rpm. for preparation of soft svo,  <dig> % gelrite  was dissolved in liquid svo. culture tubes with screw caps were filled with soft svo up to two thirds of the volume capacity and were autoclaved. to grow thermotoga on plates, double strength  of liquid svo and various concentrations of agar or gelrite were autoclaved separately and then mixed with equal volumes while they were still hot. the medium either was directly poured to petri dishes for standard spreading or streaking, or was mixed with cell cultures prior to pouring for embedded growth. a vacu-quik jar  containing a packet of  <dig> g of palladium catalyst was used for anaerobic cultivation of plates. the atmosphere inside of the jar was exchanged to 96: <dig> n2-h <dig> before it was placed into an incubator of 77°c. colonies usually appear in  <dig> h and grow bigger in  <dig> h. kanamycin was supplemented when needed at  <dig> μg ml- <dig> for liquid and  <dig> μg ml- <dig> for soft and solid cultures. cell growth in liquid was monitored by measuring the optical density of cell cultures at  <dig> nm . all aforementioned operations were carried out on the bench top.

antibiotics sensitivity tests
one ml of overnight culture was mixed with  <dig> ml of hot svo containing  <dig> % gelrite and poured into petri dishes. small discs of  <dig> mm in diameter were cut from whatman qualitative filter paper and were placed on solidified plates. various amount of kanamycin  was added to the paper discs. after  <dig> h of anaerobic incubation, sensitive strains would display inhibition zones surrounding the discs. to specify the selective levels of the antibiotic in both liquid and solid media, kanamycin ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> was supplemented, and the proliferation of bacteria was monitored for up to  <dig> h.

extraction of dna from thermotoga
plasmid dna was extracted from thermotoga using standard alkaline lysis method  <cit> . for genomic dna, overnight culture of thermotoga was extracted with equal volume of phenol: chloroform: isoamyl alcohol  followed by centrifugation at  <dig>  g for  <dig> min to remove cell debris. dna in the supernatant was precipitated with equal volume of isopropanol, washed once with 70% ethanol, air-dried, and dissolved in  <dig> mm tris-edta buffer  containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> rnase.

construction of pdh10
plasmid pkt <dig> carrying a thermostable kanamycin adenyl transferase gene  was purchased from biotools, b & m labs . primers 5'-ggggatccgaatgtggttagtgtgattag-3' and 5'-gggaattcttaaccatatcccactagttc-3' were used to amplify prq <dig>  which was linearized immediately after the stop codon of the replication protein as the result of the pcr reactions. the pcr product was digested by bamhi and ecori and was inserted into the corresponding sites of puc <dig> to give rise to pdh <dig>  the xbai-ecori fragment of pdh <dig> was then joined to pkt <dig> pre-digested with the same enzymes to generate pdh <dig>  . the constructs were confirmed by both restriction digestions and pcr. plasmid pdh <dig> carries cole <dig> origin of replication  and β-lactamase  for amplification and selection in e. coli, respectively. for its replication and selection in thermotoga, pdh <dig> relies on the ori of prq <dig> and the engineered kan gene  <cit> . the expression of the kan gene is driven by a promoter from thermus thermophilus hb <dig>  <cit> , which is expected to be active in thermotoga as well, since the consensus sequences of thermotoga  <cit>  and thermus  <cit>  promoters are nearly identical.

transformation and selection methods
liposome-mediated transformation was conducted as previously described  <cit> , except that all operations were carried out on the bench top. dotap liposomal reagent was purchased from roche diagnostics, indianapolis, in, usa. to prepare electrocompetent cells, overnight thermotoga cultures were transferred to  <dig> ml of svo liquid media and were allowed to grow until the cell density reached around  <dig> . cells were collected by centrifugation, washed once with cold deionized water and twice with the washing solution  and were resuspended in  <dig> μl of the same solution. for electroporation,  <dig> μg of plasmid dna was mixed with  <dig> μl of the freshly made competent cells and incubated on ice for  <dig> minutes prior to introduction to a pre-chilled cuvette of  <dig> mm gap. the operation settings were  <dig> μf capacitance,  <dig> Ω resistance, and  <dig> ,  <dig> , or  <dig> kv voltage . after electroporation,  <dig> ml of fresh svo liquid medium was added to each cuvette, and the cell suspension was transferred to a n <dig> serum bottle and incubated at 77°c with gentle rotation for  <dig> h for recovery. half of the recovered culture  was then mixed with  <dig> ml of hot svo solid medium supplemented with  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin, poured to petri dishes, and incubated in an anaerobic jar to retrieve transformants.

stability assays of the transformed dna in thermotoga and e. coli
cultures of thermotoga recombinant strains were transferred every  <dig> h for  <dig> days with an inoculum of 2% to a fresh svo liquid medium in the presence or absence of kanamycin. with each transfer, an aliquot of the cultures was withdrawn and diluted to 10- <dig>  ten microliters of each diluted sample was then mixed with  <dig> ml of hot svo solid medium with or without the antibiotic and was poured into a four-section petri dish. in order to facilitate comparisons, samples of the same strain  were arranged to different sections of the same plate. after incubation in an anaerobic jar for  <dig> h, colonies formed in each section were counted and compared.

to test the stability of pdh <dig> in e. coli, a liquid culture of dh5α/pdh <dig> was also transferred six times for every  <dig> h of growth in plain lb medium  with 1% inoculum. samples from each cycle were properly diluted and spread on plain lb plates to separate single colonies. one hundred such colonies were randomly chosen and were tested on lb plates containing  <dig> μg ml- <dig> ampicillin. for control purposes, strain dh5α/pkt <dig> was tested in parallel.

RESULTS
improved methods for handling thermotoga cultures in an aerobic environment
the chance of obtaining thermotoga transformants on plates can be seriously compromised if plating efficiencies are low. considering that thermotoga can tolerate brief exposures to oxygen, we simplified the overlay methods used by other groups  and developed an embedded growth method. properly diluted liquid cultures were suspended in hot svo containing  <dig> % gelrite, and the mixtures were allowed to solidify in petri dishes. in this method, cells were embedded in the medium matrix, and their exposure to oxygen was reduced. ten microliters of an overnight culture of t. sp. rq <dig> with a dilution factor of  <dig> formed  <dig> colonies , which equals to  <dig>  ×  <dig> colony forming units  per ml. by contrast, a surface culture, prepared by standard spreading in the same environment, would typically generate  <dig>  ×  <dig> cfu ml- <dig> , about ten thousand times less. given that t. neapolitana cultures contain approximate  <dig>  ×  <dig> cells after growing in liquid svo for  <dig> h at 70°c  <cit> , we estimate that the plating efficiency of our embedded method is close to 50%. this high efficiency enables us to select or screen a large number of single colonies while still enjoying the convenience of aerobic handling.

to facilitate the transfer of single colonies from solid to liquid media under aerobic conditions, we introduced a soft svo medium by adding  <dig> % gelrite to liquid svo. gelrite prevents atmospheric oxygen from penetrating deep into the medium. to transfer cultures from solid to soft svo, single colonies were picked up from plates by a loop and were pushed down to the bottoms of the test tubes containing soft svo, where a local anaerobic environment has been created. after 12- <dig> h of incubation, cultures grown in soft svo were then transferred to liquid svo by a syringe. although the introduction of soft svo seemed to prolong the overall operation cycle, it ensured maximum viability of thermotoga cells during the transfer, which eventually allowed us to isolate thermotoga transformants for the first time . soft svo may also serve as an excellent storage medium for thermotoga. cultures kept at the bench top for  <dig> months were still vital and exhibited no growth defects.

kanamycin is a suitable selection marker for t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima
to determine whether kanamycin is a suitable selection marker for thermotoga, one needs to know the sensitivity of thermotoga host strains. an initial study indicates that t. maritima is sensitive to kanamycin  <cit> , but a more recent work states that it is highly resistant to the antibiotic  <cit> . for t. sp. rq <dig>  there are simply no related reports. we decided to clarify the discrepancy of the previous findings on t. maritima and to determine the sensitivity of t. sp. rq <dig>  small discs of filter paper loaded with various amount of kanamycin were mounted on top of the svo plates premixed with thermotoga cultures . after two days of incubation, cells not affected by the antibiotic grew into a dense lawn, forming a visible background. sensitive cells in close proximity to the paper discs were unable to grow, resulting in clear halos. the inhibition zones formed on t. maritima plates  revealed that this strain is indeed sensitive to kanamycin. a distinctive zone was visible even with the lowest concentration of kanamycin. t. sp. rq <dig> displayed a similar level of sensitivity to the drug. as for t. neapolitana, slight inhibition was noticed when  <dig> μg of kanamycin was used, and a small inhibition zone was only apparent when  <dig> μg of the drug was used. therefore, kanamycin may serve as a good selection marker for t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima, but not for t. neapolitana.

we next specified the selective levels of kanamycin in both liquid and solid media. the growth of t. maritima in liquid svo was completely inhibited by  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin for at least  <dig> h . however, spontaneous mutations sometimes caused the cultures to become resistant to the antibiotic, and a complete inhibition over a period of  <dig> h was only possible when the input amount was increased to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  similar phenomena were also noticed with t. sp. rq <dig>  on svo plates, spontaneous mutants of t. maritima and t. sp. rq <dig> occasionally appeared after  <dig> h of incubation when up to  <dig> μg ml- <dig> kanamycin was added, but they rarely appeared when the antibiotic concentration was increased to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  based on these observations, for the rest of the study, kanamycin was added at  <dig> μg ml- <dig> to liquid media and at  <dig> μg ml- <dig> to soft and solid media.

transformation of thermotoga-e. coli shuttle vector pdh10
because most bacteria become competent after a short electric pulse, electroporation was attempted to introduce pdh <dig> to thermotoga. electric pulses of various strengths were applied to both t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima in the presence of  <dig> μg of plasmid dna, and the transformants were selected with embedded growth. when an electric pulse of  <dig>  kv was employed, five t. sp. rq <dig> and one t. maritima transformants were obtained. a pulse of  <dig>  kv resulted in eight t. sp. rq <dig> and no t. maritima transformants. when the voltage dropped to  <dig>  kv, no transformants were available with either species. these results suggest that the optimal voltage for thermotoga is around  <dig>  to  <dig>  kv. in the control experiment, t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima cells were treated with a pulse of  <dig>  kv in the absence of dna, and no spontaneous mutants were found.

all transformants  displayed visible growth after a  <dig> h incubation in soft svo. three rq7/pdh <dig> strains  and the single tm/pdh <dig> strain were propagated in liquid svo for extraction of plasmid and genomic dna. on agarose gels, no pdh <dig> dna could be detected from the plasmid extract of any strain, even though prq <dig> was clearly visible from the three rq7/pdh <dig> samples, indicating that the extraction procedure was successful. plasmid and genomic dna extracted from an equal amount of each transformant culture was then subject to pcr analysis. a fragment of  <dig> bp, corresponding to the size of the kan gene, was obtained from each plasmid extract  but was missing from the genomic dna of rq7/pdh <dig> # <dig> and # <dig>  the pcr products were gel-purified and were subject to restriction digestion with agei, which is expected to cleave the kan gene into two fragments of  <dig> and  <dig> bp. indeed, the digestion reactions released these expected fragments from every sample , indicating that the pcr products were authentic kan genes.

for validation and comparison purposes, pdh <dig> was also introduced to t. sp. rq <dig> and t. maritima through liposome-mediated transformation. four t. sp. rq <dig> and five t. maritima transformants were obtained from  <dig> μg of plasmid dna, as opposed to zero colonies from the samples treated with liposomes containing no dna. all transformants grew well in both soft and liquid selective media, and the presence of the kan gene was also confirmed by pcr.

transformed dna was stably maintained in thermotoga
to determine the stability of the transformed dna, liquid cultures of rq7/pdh <dig> and tm/pdh <dig> were transferred every  <dig> h, for six consecutive times, to fresh media in the presence or absence of kanamycin. cultures from each transfer cycle were tested with both svo  and svo+kan plates. the number of colonies on a plain svo plate represents the quantity of total viable cells in a sample, whereas the number from a svo+kan plate defines the abundance of resistant cells. surprisingly, by the end of the experiment, ~100% of both rq7/pdh <dig> and tm/pdh <dig> still had the transformed dna, even without the selective pressure . the kan gene was confirmed by pcr from the plasmid preparations of all strains after each transfer.

incorporation of prq <dig> increased the stability of puc <dig> derivatives in e. coli
the stable maintenance of the transformed dna in thermotoga motivated us to test the stability of pdh <dig> in e. coli under non-selective conditions. the parent vector pkt <dig>  a derivative of puc <dig>  was used as the control. interestingly, pdh <dig> was much more stable in e. coli than pkt <dig> was. the parent vector pkt <dig> was eliminated by ~90% of the host cells after a single transfer and was completely lost from the population after three transfers . by contrast, pdh <dig> was eliminated at a much slower rate. it was carried by ~90% of the cells after three transfers and ~32% of the cells after six transfers. intact pdh <dig> was obtained from the resistant colonies. it is noteworthy to mention that similar results were also obtained when pdh <dig> and puc <dig> were compared in the same way. these data demonstrate that the insertion of the prq <dig> sequence somehow enhances the stability of puc family vectors. we next compared the copy numbers of pdh <dig> and pkt <dig> in their e. coli hosts. the two vectors were prepared from the same amount of cells and were digested by xbai and ecori. these double digestions released the prq <dig> sequence from pdh <dig> . the abundances of the shared vector backbone of pdh <dig> and pkt <dig> were comparable on an agarose gel , suggesting that the copy numbers of two vectors were similar. therefore, the dramatically improved stability of pdh <dig> is not caused by an increase in copy number.

*results of four independent tests.

discussion
improved method for cultivation of thermotoga
the success of isolating transformants from solid media is essential to any genetic manipulation attempt. whereas this is not a concern with aerobic mesophiles like e. coli, this requirement has become a limiting factor for the genetic investigations of many strict anaerobic, hyperthermophilic organisms. one obstacle is the requirement of an anaerobic glove box to handle plates. since picking up colonies requires great precision, reaching out to a single colony with an inoculation loop or a toothpick through thick gloves has proven to be challenging for many of us. even though gloveless chambers are commercially available, they are costly to maintain. rolling tubes or tissue culture flasks in combination to hungate techniques may serve as alternatives  <cit> , but they are prone to cross contaminations due to the narrow openings of these containers. based on the fact that thermotoga are fairly oxygen-tolerant, especially when they are not actively growing  <cit> , we prepare thermotoga solid cultures with an embedded method, independent of an anaerobic chamber or an anoxic gas conduit. our method sustains ~50% plating efficiency, making it possible to select for thermotoga transformants among a sizeable population of viable cells. in addition, we developed a soft svo medium to bridge the transfer of cultures from solid media to liquid media in an aerobic environment. soft svo is easy to make and convenient to use, and it also allows the withdrawal of cultures using a syringe.

transformation and expression of the kan gene
a heterologous kan gene has been functionally expressed and stably established in thermotoga. the kan gene, carried on the shuttle vector pdh <dig>  was introduced to thermotoga by both electroporation and liposome-mediated transformation. the latter approach yields higher transformation efficiency , but the former has the potential to mass-produce competent cells for future needs. electrocompetency has been established in thermotoga in this study, and a transformation efficiency of ~ <dig> transformants per μg of dna has been observed in rq <dig> and ~ <dig>  in t. maritima. two factors might have caused the transformation efficiencies to be low: the damages caused by oxygen and the activities of restriction-modification systems. because the preparation of electrocompetent cells and the transformation procedure were performed under aerobic conditions, a significant portion of the thermotoga cells would not survive the handling. performing the experiment in an anaerobic chamber should help to improve the transformation efficiencies, albeit the operations would be cumbersome. in addition, restriction-modification systems have been discovered in thermotoga, for instance, we have recently characterized a thermotoga-specific type ii restriction-modification system  <cit> . unmethylated foreign dna will be restricted by host-specific restriction nucleases as soon as they enter thermotoga cells. proper methylation of pdh <dig> prior to transformation is expected to significantly increase the quantity of transformants. indeed, electrotransformation efficiency in clostridia has been improved by 104~ <dig> folds by methylating the shuttle vectors  <cit> .

although intact plasmid dna of pdh <dig> has not been detected in thermotoga, we favor the idea that pdh <dig> is autonomous in thermotoga, because the kan gene is always associated to a plasmid preparation instead of a genomic dna extract . if pdh <dig> had been integrated into the chromosome, we would have seen the kan gene appearing more often from the genomic samples than from the plasmid extracts. our data stated otherwise , suggesting that pdh <dig> is likely an independent molecule rather than part of the chromosome. because genomic dna can include both chromosomal and plasmid dna, it is not surprising to occasionally obtain a positive signal from a genomic dna sample, even though the kan gene is carried by a free-living plasmid. we suspect that pdh <dig> has an extremely low copy number in thermotoga, because the attempts to detect it by inverse pcr , retransformation , or southern blotting  did not generate any signals. the expected inverse pcr product is ~ <dig> kb, much bigger than the kan gene. this makes the inverse pcr technically more challenging than just amplifying the kan gene.

CONCLUSIONS
in spite of the intriguing questions awaited to be answered with these elusive organisms, the door to the genetic manipulation of thermotoga has been reopened. ten years after the report of transient expression of heterologous genes in thermotoga  <cit> , we confirm that thermotoga are truly transformable, not only by liposome-mediated transformation, but also by electroporation. engineered thermotoga strains are available for the first time.
