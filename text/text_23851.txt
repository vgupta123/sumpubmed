BACKGROUND
there currently are no biomarkers that can accurately track, correlate, or predict the occurrence of renal injury, particularly when related to drug-related toxicity . there is a growing interest in the role of micro ribonucleic acids  in the pathogenesis of renal diseases  <cit>  and a growing number of investigations are directed to characterizing their potential as biomarkers . mirnas are highly conserved, endogenous, small , non-coding rnas, with the primary role implicated in post-transcriptional silencing. since a single mirna can regulate multiple transcripts, mirnas can potentially impact multiple signaling pathways and their dysregulation may lead to a variety of different disorders including renal disease  <cit> . in fact, several mirnas have been implicated in various renal diseases, including diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, glomerulonephritis, renal cancer, and polycystic kidney disease . mirnas are secreted into the circulation by many different mechanisms including various lipid-containing vesicles, such as exosomes, microvesicles, and apoptotic bodies, but can also be protected from degradation by binding to rna-binding proteins  <cit> . due to their stability, mirnas are readily quantified in serum, plasma and other body fluids, and thus more investigations are being directed to characterizing their potential as biomarkers. in fact, study results from our laboratory and other participating members of the health and environmental sciences institute’s  nephrotoxicity committee have identified changes in mirna levels in various kidney disease animal models. although quantitative real-time pcr  has most commonly been used to profile annotated mirnome, newer technologies which promise increased sensitivity and specificity are becoming available at astonishing rates. for example, next-generation sequencing  is gaining popularity and has successfully been used to characterize mirna profiles in various tissues  <cit>  as well as bio-fluids including blood and, most recently, cerebral spinal fluid  <cit> . although ngs platform has been shown to generate highly reproducible, accurate data with high correlation to other platforms for high quality rna samples , comparative data on media with low quality and quantity rna are lacking.

the objective of this study was to characterize the mirna expression changes using two different profiling platforms in urine specimens following induction of toxic renal tubular injury in rodents with gentamicin. gentamicin is an aminoglycoside antibiotics which like other nephrotoxicants such as mercuric chloride and chromium induces injury of renal tubular epithelial cells  <cit> . gentamicin has also been reported to induce more severe nephrotoxicity than other aminoglycoside antibiotics when administered at high doses  <cit>  and has already been shown to induce mirna changes in rats, albeit at a different dose and treatment regimen  <cit> . accordingly, we performed a global urinary mirna expression profiling using both the more conventional qrt-pcr taqman low density array  method as well as ngs in control and treated rats. the presence of tubular epithelial injury was confirmed by histopathology and assessment of a panel of urine protein biomarkers that have been qualified for use in non-clinical drug development  <cit> : kidney injury molecule- <dig> , total protein, and beta 2- microglobulin.

although a recent paper has described ngs characterization of exosomal and non-exosomal mirnas in human urine  <cit> , to our knowledge, this is the first time that the ngs and qrt-pcr based platforms have been compared in urine. we report that although both platforms were able to identify drug induced changes in mirna expression, that there is discordance in the level of sensitivity of detection. specifically, with exception of three mirnas, mirna-seq did not detect some mirnas which were identified by qrt-pcr with threshold cycle  values lower than  <dig> in every urine specimen analyzed. these differences could be due to the level of sensitivity posed by ngs analysis for low abundant mirnas which, are easily detected by the qrt-pcr method . on the other hand, the vast majority of mirnas detected by ngs were in their isomeric forms, and thus could not have been detected by the pre-designed qrt-pcr primers available on the tlda-a. our results suggest that although mirna-seq is specific, with few false positive calls, it may not detect certain low abundant mirnas in low quality rna specimen like those currently obtained from urine. however, the qrt-pcr analysis will miss a wealth of information, most importantly in the form of isoforms. in summary, we have compared the detection of urinary mirna alterations in tubular injury with qrt-pcr and mirna-seq. each platform has its strengths and weaknesses and therefore, careful considerations should be made when selecting a platform of choice for urinary mirna profiling.

RESULTS
histopathology and urinary protein biomarker data indicate gentamicin induced tubular injury at d <dig> with 50 mg/kg
in order to characterize the mirna changes that could be used as biomarkers of acute renal tubular injury, a study was conducted in the context of the hesi committee on biomarkers of nephrotoxicity in a well-established rat gentamicin toxicity model. rats were injected subcutaneously daily for seven days with various dose levels of gentamicin, including  <dig> and 50 mg/kg/day. minimal urine biomarker changes were observed after only 24 hours of dosing. however, after 7 days of dosing, there were significantly increased levels of urine total protein, beta-2-microglobulin and kim- <dig> , consistent with renal tubular injury.these urine biomarker levels correlated well with the histopathological findings, which involved proximal convoluted tubules , and to a lesser extent, distal convoluted tubules . these changes consisted of tubular epithelial degeneration and necrosis characterized by varying degrees of vacuolar and hyaline degeneration, attenuation, loss of epithelial cellular detail , and detachment from intact basement membranes. cellular debris and cellular and hyaline casts were present in tubular lumens . these changes were associated with multifocal minimal to mild tubular epithelial regeneration occurring primarily in the pct, and were characterized by basophilic cytoplasm, vesicular nuclei, and infrequent mitoses. in three rats, pct degeneration and necrosis was categorized grade  <dig>  at day  <dig>  and hence they were selected for further mirna analysis in the ngs studies. there were minimal to mild interstitial mononuclear leukocytic infiltrates. these changes correlated with increased organ weight and macroscopically pale/enlarged kidneys.figure  <dig>

levels of mirnas in urine significantly changed following gentamicin induced tubule injury
the transcript levels of  <dig> mirnas were measured in the urine specimen for two time points  after gentamicin treatment by tlda-a .  <dig> mirnas were detected by qrt-pcr with ct values of ≤  <dig> in at least 20% of the urine specimen analyzed. it is important to note that although  <dig> mirnas were actually detected in urine by qrt-pcr only  <dig>  had a corresponding identifier in mirbase v  <dig>  similarly, although  <dig> urinary mirnas changed significantly with gentamicin treatment  seven days post treatment as compared to the controls  and all were identified in mirbase v  <dig>  a total of  <dig> mirnas were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated. concordant with the urinary biomarkers analyzed, no significant mirna changes were observed at day  <dig> post gentamicin treatment . furthermore, no significant gentamicin induced changes were observed in urine volumes .figure  <dig>

small rna next generation sequencing can be used to evaluate mirna expression in urinary samples
we next carried out next generation sequencing  to assess the feasibility of this new technology for analyzing mirnas in urine samples as compared to the traditional more prevalent qrt-pcr methods widely used. these cross-comparison studies were performed on seven control urine samples collected at day  <dig> from rats with no tubular injury as well as the three rats from the 50 mg/kg group from day  <dig> with the highest  level of gentamicin induced tubular injury . as depicted in figure 3a, after isolating total rna from the urine specimen and checking for rna extraction quality as well as quantity, half of each extraction was used in the tlda analysis and the other half was sent to beijing genomics institute of americas corporation  for small rna sequencing. table  <dig> lists the quality and quantity of the rna extracted from the urine specimens and depicts the poor quality as well as low quantity in the  <dig> control and  <dig> gentamicin treated samples. rna samples were further processed, including gel selection of small rnas , 5' rna adapter ligation and gel purification, 3' rna adapter ligation and gel purification, rt-pcr and gel purification, and despite their low quality did yield a comprehensive small rna library which was used in the sequencing via the illumina hiseqtm  <dig> .the ngs analysis on the control  and gentamicin treated  urine specimens, yielded an average of  <dig> million raw reads/sample. after removing adapter sequences and filtering out reads too short to be accurately mapped , we obtained on average  <dig> million clean reads/urine sample . on average 99% of the sequences were trimmed and ~96% were between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides long . figure 4a shows the breakdown of mirnas, exons, non-coding rna  and unaligned sequences. the mirnas formed a very small portion of reads ranging from  <dig> -3% of total reads. as explained in the methods section, the mapping is dominated by precursors , which indicates a lot of heterogeneity in the mirnas not accounted for by base substitutions/deletions/insertions at 3’ and 5’ ends. the vast majority of mirnas detected in these urine specimens were in fact isomirs . we also observed that there were negligible amounts of primer-dimers . exons constituted 11% to as much as 50%. 2-19% of the reads mapped to other non-coding rnas including snorna, rrna, lincrna, while a major portion of the reads  remained unaligned in the  <dig> samples and perhaps could be indicative of contaminants. we next investigated the alignment of the reads to other species. figure 4c illustrates that although a substantial portion of mirnas aligned to the rat ,  <dig> -17% aligned to the mouse genome while  <dig> -16% mapped to human. specifically,  <dig> distinct species of mirnas were detected:  <dig> from rat,  <dig> from mouse and  <dig> from human.we next moved to the cluster and differential expression analysis . we observed that clustering between the groups was lost when the filtering criteria were altered and we thus had to employ various filtering criteria to optimize the segregation between control and gentamicin treated samples. this lack of a clear segregation suggests that very few mirnas are differentially expressed between treated and control samples and that the mirnas are expressed at very low levels. filtering criterion allowing for inclusion of mirnas which were detected in at least  <dig> of  <dig> samples gave the best segregation . this yielded  <dig> mirnas . when we compared the  <dig> mirnas detected by ngs to the  <dig> mirnas identified by qrt-pcr, we observed that although  <dig> were detected by both platforms,  <dig> were detected only by ngs and  <dig> were specific to tlda-a.figure  <dig>

additionally, we also investigated the extent of concordance as the percentage of rat mirnas that are detected in the control and gentamicin-treated samples analyzed by both ngs and tlda-a . out of the total  <dig> rat-mirnas detected in tlda-a  <dig> %  are detected in all  <dig> control samples. similarly, out of the  <dig> ngs detected rat mirnas  <dig> %  were detected consistently in all control samples. thirty five out of the thirty seven mirnas consistently detected in all  <dig> controls by ngs were also detected in all  <dig> samples by tlda-a. however,  <dig> %  are detected in only  <dig> sample in ngs compared to only  <dig> %  in tlda-a. similar investigations from our ngs analysis show that out of the  <dig> mirnas detected, 40%  occur in only isomeric forms and do not have a mature form in mirbase v <dig>  twenty one of the seventy three isomeric mirnas are detected in  <dig> samples, whereas  <dig>  are detected in only one sample. interestingly six of these isomeric mirnas could potentially also be detected by tlda-a as the primers used in the platform may not distinguish these from their mature forms. out of  <dig> mirnas with mature forms,  <dig> are detected in all  <dig> control urine specimen. similar trends are observed in gentamicin-treated samples.table  <dig> 
percentages of mirnas detected in control  and gentamicin-treated  specimen




since a large proportion of reads  remained unaligned to rat , we investigated the origin of highly represented sequences in the reads that remained unaligned. in  <dig> of the  <dig> gentamicin treated specimen, a single sequence comprised over 40% of the unaligned reads. one sample was highly contaminated by a pcr primer and the other sample was contaminated with a sequence from the zebrafish. similarly, in control samples we observed contamination from a variety of bacterial and fungal genomes . this may indicate fungal and bacterial contamination during sample collection or alternatively these contaminations may have been inadvertently introduced during sample processing procedures. to what extent these contaminations affected the ngs results needs to be determined although among control samples, sample  <dig> had the least amount of contamination and detected the maximum number  of distinct mirna species, whereas sample  <dig> that had the most contamination contributed  <dig> mirnas.

we also investigated the possibility that some of these unaligned reads may have a dietary origin and thus performed additional mapping to the wheat, corn and soybean genomes. we observed that a proportion of our unaligned reads did originate from dietary genomes from wheat , corn  and soybean .

next we investigated various normalization strategies. recent literature suggest that mirna-seq has its own challenges and applying the normalization strategies commonly used in mrna-seq may need further refinement for use on mirna sequencing data  <cit> . we thus compared three different normalization strategies and three differential analysis methods. deseq and edger were applied to their respective normalizations and limma was applied to rpm normalized data. edger normalized values gave the best segregation and gave the maximum number of overlap with the differentially regulated mirnas identified by qrt-pcr and hence are reported here.

applying the above described clustering and normalization strategies resulted in identification of  <dig> differentially regulated mirnas .  <dig> were up regulated and  <dig> were down regulated . three mirnas, rno-mir-320-3p, rno-mir-203a-3p, and rno-let-7d-5p, were found to be significantly altered by both the qrt-pcr and ngs analysis in the gentamicin treated urine specimens. for these mirnas, both platforms reported them to be similarly regulated; mir- <dig> was up regulated while let-7d and mir- <dig> were down regulated .table  <dig>

prediction of mirna targets and pathway analysis relevant to renal injury
ingenuity modeling of the differentially expressed mirnas identified by qrt-pcr and ngs was undertaken to better understand the targets and pathways regulated. we ran the predicted mirna targets from the ngs and the taqman qrt-pcr analysis separately through ingenuity’s tox function prediction. the main toxicological functions associated with mirnas detected by either platform are renal inflammation . in addition, biological functions like cell cycle and cellular development were associated with mirnas from both platforms. next, pathway analysis was performed using experimentally verified targets of mirnas from each platform. mirnas from ngs were associated with  <dig> targets mainly involved with tissue injury & repair, increased levels of red blood cells, and renal necrosis. mirnas identified by tlda-a produced  <dig> targets involved in renal inflammation, kidney failure, renal necrosis, as well as increased levels of red blood cells, alkaline phosphatase and creatinine. top pathways included il6-signaling  and erk/mapk cascade .although multiple signaling pathways were predicted for the mirnas from both profiling platforms, the main toxicology related function was ‘nephritis’. specifically, two out of the three mirnas common to both qpcr and ngs approaches  mapped to this function . we expanded our search for renal-related functions within the remaining set of differentially regulated mirna’s by examining other renal-related associations within the ‘tox function’ and ‘diseases and bio functions’ available with ipa analysis. this led to identification of several additional renal activities, including a link between the third common mirna identified by both platforms, mir- <dig>  and polycystic kidney disease . to investigate the potential targets for the three mirnas identified by both ngs and qrt-pcr, network analysis of the genes experimentally linked to let-7d, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> was investigated. this analysis yielded a number of interesting genes linked to renal necrosis consistent with gentamicin induced nephrotoxicity  which warrant further investigations in future studies.figure  <dig>

discussion
this study builds on a growing data set indicating that mirnas in body fluids can be used as non-invasive biomarkers for detecting and monitoring various pathophysiological conditions. gentamicin, an aminoglycoside antibiotic used to treat many types of gram negative bacterial infections, is a known nephrotoxicant. the underlying mechanism of gentamicin renal toxicity is assumed to be mainly related to the formation of free hydroxyl radicals and the inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, although other mechanisms have also been suggested . the microscopic findings in the kidneys observed in this study were similar to those previously documented following administration of gentamicin to rats . therefore, in this study, gentamicin at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day successfully induced tubular injury 7 days post treatment . the objective of this study was to induce nephrotoxicity in rats with gentamicin and evaluate two mirna profiling platforms in detecting significant changes in urine samples.

sequencing allows for complete evaluation of all small rnas, without primer bias or a need for species annotation and as ngs analysis becomes more affordable, more scientists are choosing this platform in their investigations. several studies have examined the concordance between various profiling platforms including quantitative rt-pcr and mirna-seq and although it is generally believed that for high quality specimens intra-platform variability is usually minimal, cross-platform comparisons do not necessarily correlate well . even less is known on comparisons in biofluids, especially urine. to address this issue, we have analyzed rna derived from urine specimen using life technologies’ tlda-a and illumina’s ngs platforms. we thus prepared small rna sequencing libraries using illumina’s truseq sample preparation kit from urinary total rna extracted and used on the qrt-pcr analysis, and sequenced the samples on the hiseq  <dig> . utilizing ngs allowed us to identify several kidney-related mirna which were significantly changed in rats exposed to the kidney toxicant gentamicin. however, the majority of mirnas identified by ngs were not the same as those identified on tlda-a cards . thus, we report for the first time, that there is a minimal agreement between ngs and qrt-pcr for low yield urinary mirna analysis.

the observed minimal agreement between the two platforms could be due to a variety of reasons. one reason could be the fact that we only analyzed mirnas available on the tlda-a, which does not include most of the mirnas detected by ngs. tlda allows for quantitation of  <dig> mouse and  <dig> rat mirnas based on sanger mirbase v.  <dig> annotations. out of  <dig> mirna sequences on the tlda-a,  <dig> had a corresponding identifier in rat mirbase v. 20;  <dig> in mouse and  <dig> in human.  <dig> tlda-a mirnas could not be found in mirbase v.  <dig> as they were deprecated. out of the  <dig> mirnas that were detected to be differentially expressed using ngs , five  were represented on the tlda-a, while nine  were not. in fact, these  <dig> mirnas are in their isomeric forms . this finding highlights a key limitation in the qrt-pcr analysis as the tlda primers may only detect some isomirs with extra bases on either ends, but will miss the isomers with deletions/substitutions. hence, only a subset of mirnas are queried on the tlda-a, and as our results indicate, nine mirnas differentially regulated in ngs could not be detected by the tlda-a due to its dependency of primer design. employing the full tlda array capabilities to include both a and b cards may improve concordance. the ngs platform, on the other hand, seems to be highly sensitive to the presence of contaminants. as observed in this study, contaminations ranging from pcr primers to bacterial and fungal genomes could negatively affect detectability of low expressing mirnas. hence the sample with the least amount of contamination contributed the maximum species of mirnas compared to ones with higher contamination. additionally, as depicted in table  <dig>  out of the total  <dig> and  <dig> rat-mirnas detected in tlda-a and ngs control samples respectively, mirnas in tlda-a seem to be far more consistently detected than in ngs.although the absence of primer-dimer sequences indicated that there was enough genetic material to sequence, a large proportion of the reads aligned to non-coding rnas . furthermore, a large proportion  of reads could not be aligned to the rat genome, which may indicate the presence of exogenous rnas, mrna degradation, genetic material expelled through urine, and other contaminants mainly from dietary, bacterial and fungal origins . for example, most of the mirnas that were mapped to mouse  and human  can be traced to 3’ regions of protein coding regions of rat. furthermore, about  <dig> -16% of detected mirnas belonged to human and mouse.  <dig> out of  <dig> mouse mirnas and  <dig> out of  <dig> human mirnas detected in the samples were found in unannotated regions of rat genome. these findings, together with the fact that the number of mirnas annotated to the rat is only about a third compared to human and half as many as in mouse strongly suggests that the rat mirnome may be under-annotated.

another reason for the low concordance between the  <dig> platforms may be their differences in sensitivity. specifically, following reverse transcription of mirna targets, we performed a pre-amplification step to increase our detection capabilities for the low expressing mirnas, which is a step not currently available for the mirna ngs analysis. the use of cdna pre-amplification has been proposed to increase the sensitivity of mirna detection, although with increased variability for low abundant mirnas  <cit> . however, all three mirnas: let-7d, mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig> were reliably detected by qrt-pcr in every sample with low mean ct values  which suggests relatively high levels of urinary expression. therefore, it is likely that although the qrt-pcr method will yield a higher level of sensitivity , the ngs may actually provide higher specificity. specifically, mirna-seq did not detect some mirnas which qrt-pcr detected . in our study we were able to evaluate the ngs samples to a depth of  <dig> million reads. it would thus be interesting to examine if increasing the sequencing depth could improve detection sensitivity and concordance between the technologies.

these results suggest that although mirna-seq is specific, due to its currently stringent rna input requirements, it may not be able to detect certain low quantity  and low quality  rnas in urine at the conditions used in this study . additionally, although total rna was extracted for each sample and divided between the tlda and ngs analysis, the rna was further enriched for small rnas during the illumina truseq small rna library preparation. just as the pre-amplification step in the tlda platform may introduce bias, steps such as rna ligation may introduce technical bias during the ngs library construction  <cit> . none the less, as reported previously, urine in general contains very little rna  <cit> , and this low quality and quantity of the rna  might be key to the low observed concordance between these platforms. efforts to improve the quality of rna to be extracted from urine specimen may decrease the inter-platform variability observed. recently, as more commercially available kits are designed for this purpose, more investigators are evaluating the quality as well as quantity of mirnas extracted from urine  <cit> . these investigations together with improved methodology for enriching of small rnas to be used in profiling platforms hold promise for improved concordance. furthermore, although in this study we used cell-free urine probably containing both exosomal as well as non-exosomal mirnas, enriching for exosomal rnas may also shed light on differences in analysis between profiling platforms  <cit> .therefore, our data suggest that each platform has its own advantages and disadvantages and their utility should be decided based on the experimental objectives and study design limitations. regardless of platform differences, the three mirnas identified by both platforms, let-7d, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  hold promise as tubular injury biomarkers due to their strong functional associations with cellular process or pathways relevant to renal disease. in fact, the main toxicology related function predicted by ipa was ‘renal nephritis’ . looking at each platform independently, it seems like the differentially regulated mirnas identified by tlda-a, namely mir-16-5p, 185-5p, 200b-3p, 208a-3p, 23a-3p, 30c-3p,  <dig>  494-3p and 92a-3p which are associated with nephritis  may be promising biomarkers of tubule injury. similarly, mir-100-5p and let-7a-5p implicated in renal inflammation and nephritis may be tubular injury biomarkers specifically detected by ngs. taken together, these results suggest that mirnas isolated from urine and profiled by either ngs or qrt-pcr could potentially serve as translational biomarkers for detection of some forms of renal injury.

CONCLUSIONS
drug induced kidney injury is not only an unfortunate clinical manifestation but it also hinders pharmaceutical progress. urine samples have the potential to provide a wealth of information both for clinical applications as well as translational investigators, and provide a perfect medium for biomarkers of injury. to our knowledge, this is the first study comparing urinary mirna expression data generated by qrt-pcr to those from sequencing. although, the high cost of these experiments prohibited us from performing technical replicates and limited our sample size , we were able to evaluate mirna expression analysis employing two very different technologies and show that, for at least three mirnas, that there was high inter-platform concordance.

in summary, we have shown that differentially expressed urinary mirnas can be detected by two distinct profiling platforms, qrt-pcr and mirna-seq. our data indicate that the three mirnas detected by both technologies may be useful urinary biomarkers for tubular injury.
