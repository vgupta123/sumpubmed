BACKGROUND
small rnas  play a central role in plant development and other important plant functions. eukaryotic srnas are approximately 21-24-nucleotides molecules involved in many different cell processes, including development, heterochromatin formation, genome rearrangement, hormone signalling and metabolism  <cit> . there are different classes of srnas: short interfering rnas, trans-acting rnas and micrornas   <cit>  amongst others.

mirs are small, endogenous rnas that regulate gene expression in plants and animals by promoting cleavage or translation inhibition of mrnas coded by specific target genes  <cit> . the stem-loop region of a long primary nuclear transcript  is processed into 21-nucleotide rnas by a multistep process involving the activity of dcl <dig>  <cit> , hen <dig> and hyl <dig> proteins  <cit> . ago <dig> is the most important argonaute protein in the plant mir pathway and preferentially binds small rnas with a 5' terminal uridine such as most mirs  <cit> . mirs are involved in plant development, signal transduction, transcription factor accumulation, protein degradation, response to environmental stresses and pathogen invasion  <cit> . mirs are expressed at variable levels in diverse tissues and developmental stages  <cit> , regulate their own biogenesis  <cit>  and it has been reported that modest changes in mir level can result in substantial changes in the accumulation of mrnas target genes  <cit> . these facts evidence that mir expression is under a tight and fine regulation.

over-expression of mir genes or viral proteins, such as post-transcriptional gene silencing  suppressors, cause multiple developmental defects by interfering with mir-guided target cleavage/degradation  <cit> . viral infections also cause mir alteration and development abnormalities or symptoms  <cit> . however, it is not totally clear how viral infections interfere with mir pathways  <cit>  and which are the consequences of such interference. in brassica sp. for example, it has been reported that turnip mosaic virus infection specifically induced the accumulation of mir <dig> that targets a tir-nbs-lrr class disease-resistant transcripts for cleavage  <cit> . these data clearly suggest an important role of mirs in host-pathogen interactions. basically, mir pathways could be affected at transcriptional or post-transcriptional levels, the latter involving mirs processing, accumulation and activity. most of the articles reporting mir alteration upon viral infection or transgenic expression of viral proteins uncovered post-transcriptional regulation involving the silencing suppressors activity  <cit> . nonetheless it was also shown that expression of viral proteins with non-ptgs suppressor activity can also alter mirs accumulation  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge there are so far no reports of the alteration of mirs transcription upon plant viral infections.

in this work, we analyzed whether the transcriptional regulation of a mir promoter was altered by a plant virus infection. we selected mir <dig> since its accumulation is increased after tobacco mosaic virus  infection  <cit> , it is involved in plant development and its mrna targets are well known  <cit> . mir <dig> is potentially transcribed from three independent loci, mir164a, mir164b and mir164c  <cit>  and negatively regulates transcription factors with nac domains such as cuc <dig> and cuc <dig>  <cit> . these factors are redundantly involved in the initiation of the shoot apical meristem and in the establishment of cotyledon and floral organ boundaries  <cit> . recently, it was also shown that mir <dig> participate in a trifurcate feed-forward pathway involved in cell death in arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . here, we cloned the putative arabidopsis thaliana mir164a promoter , obtained a. thaliana transgenic lines expressing the uida reporter gene  under its regulation, and studied its spatial and temporal expression. finally, we analyzed the p-mir164a activity and the mature mir <dig>  pre-mir164a and cucs mrnas accumulation after viral infections and hormone treatments.

RESULTS
bioinformatic analysis and cloning of the putative promoter sequence of the mir164a gene
in order to characterize and define the proper mir164a gene promoter sequence and its regulatory elements, we performed an in silico analysis of the approximately  <dig>  kbp region located upstream of the mature mir164a sequence. a previous report showed that a  <dig>  kbp fragment upstream of mir164a is able to rescue null mir <dig> mutant lines  <cit> . using the plantcare database http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ <cit>  we identified the putative transcription start site and promoter elements within the  <dig>  kbp. in silico analysis identified putative sequence elements related to stress response and others involved in gibberellic, abscisic, salicylic and jasmonic acids responses . in addition, circadian control and anaerobic drought responses motifs were also predicted within this fragment and finally,  <dig> enhancer elements and  <dig> light-responsive related sequences were found not randomly distributed . a  <dig> bp fragment  was pcr amplified, cloned and completely sequenced to verify its identity and will be referred from now on as the mir164a promoter . the mir164a locus within its genomic context and the mir164a precursor are represented in figure  <dig> 

putative motifs recognized by transcription factors  related to aba, defense and stress, fungal elicitors, gibberellins, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid were detected using plantcare program . the site name, consensus sequence and the first organism where it was described were indicated. the positions were assigned relative to the mir164a transcription start site.  and  indicate sense or antisense dna strands.

p-mir164a is mainly expressed in the plant vascular tissue and its activity is developmentally regulated
in order to study the transcriptional activity of p-mir164a, we produced a set of arabidopsis transgenic plants expressing gus under its regulation . as positive and negative controls, transgenic plants harboring a construct containing gus controlled by the 35s cauliflower mosaic virus promoter , and transgenic plants for gus lacking a regulatory sequence  were obtained. three p-mir164::gus lines were selected to illustrate low , medium  and high  levels of gus expression out of  <dig> independent transgenic lines. all of them clearly showed a similar spatial pattern of expression . the three lines segregated in a 3: <dig> ratio in t <dig> indicating a single locus of transgene insertion. in addition, one representative 35s::gus line and one ev::gus line were selected among several independent lines . the selected lines were brought to homozygosis, and the presence of 35s promoter, p-mir <dig> and gus sequences was confirmed by pcr using specific primers .

temporal and spatial gus activity was observed in the different transgenic lines; gus activity was detected in the entire plant vasculature  and in leaf hydathodes  as previously described  <cit> . in reproductive organs, gus staining was found in all carpel compound tissues and was stronger in its vasculature . gus expression was also detected in siliques , petals and stamen vascular tissue and in the septum that separates the lobes of the each anther's thecae  whereas no gus staining was found in the sepals. in detail, in stems, gus stain was shown to be restricted to developing xylem vessels . to study the activity of p-mir164a during plant development, a time course assay was performed. results revealed that all p-mir164::gus transgenic lines had detectable gus staining from seedlings up to almost stage  <dig>  according to boyes et. al.,  <cit> , showing a clear increase in the expression level at stages  <dig>  to  <dig>  , while stage  <dig> had almost undetectable gus activities. all these data suggested a developmental transcriptional regulation of p-mir164a during plant life cycle.

we additionally evaluated p-mir164a activity in different plant species by microprojectile bombardment or agro-infiltration assays. promoter activity showed to be ubiquitous since it was conspicuous within monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants, such as allium cepa, solanum tuberosum, helianthus annuus and nicotiana benthamiana . in contrast, p-mir164a activity was not detected when transfecting mammalian bhk or insect sf <dig> cells with appropriate constructs .

viral infections induce p-mir164a activity
it has been shown that mir accumulation is altered after viral infection most likely at post-transcriptional level  <cit> . to study whether virus infection could also interfere with mir pathways at the transcriptional level, we quantified p-mir164a-derived gus activity after viral infection. we independently inoculated  two p-mir164a::gus lines showing low  and high  gus expression level to consider the influence of the genomic context of the t-dna insertion, 35s::gus and ev::gus plants with oilseed rape mosaic virus  and tmv-cg. these two viruses were chosen because they clearly differ on the severity of the symptoms they produce on arabidopsis plants, very mild in the case of tmv-cg and strong in the case of ormv, even when both viruses are proposed to be strains of the same species of the tobamovirus family  <cit> . also importantly, tobamoviruses were reported to alter mirs levels in tobacco and arabidopsis  <cit> . in the experimental conditions, both tobamoviruses infected a high percentage of plants  and accumulated to high titers . first, the tissue localization pattern of gus activity after viral infections was compared through histochemical staining assays and no clear alterations were detected upon infections . next, gus activity was measured using a total rosette protein extract to minimize the characteristic patchy tissue distribution effect of areas with different infection levels. as shown in figure 3a, gus activity was statistically significantly increased after infection with the most severe virus  in both p-mir164a::gus lines. even though not statistically significant, mean gus activity values were also higher in both p-mir164a::gus lines after tmv-cg infection. as expected, gus activity did not change in control 35s::gus plants evidencing the specificity of p-mir164a induction upon virus infection.

to provide additional evidence that the transcriptional activity of p-mir164a is induced after infection, the level of pre-mir164a transcripts was analyzed by rt-pcr after viral infection. figure 3b shows a clear increase of pre-mir164a accumulation after ormv infection and a slight increase after tmv-cg infection compared to mock-inoculated treatments in two biological replicates using l <dig> plants. this assay was repeated with similar results in line l <dig> . although all transgenic lines were equivalent to arabidopsis wild type  for this purpose , tissues from l <dig> and l <dig> lines were analyzed to preserve the same genetic background used in gus activity assays. in order to quantify the effect of virus infection on pre-mir164a abundance, qrt-pcr analysis was performed in arabidopsis wild type plants after ormv infection and compared to the mock-treated plants. pre-mir164a gene expression increased more than six fold after ormv infection, estimating gene expression ratio with a p-value of  <dig>  through the rest algorithm  <cit>  .

altogether, these data indicated that viral infections elevated the activity of p-mir164a evidencing that they also interfered with mirs pathways at the transcriptional level and that this induction was stronger in the case of ormv, the most severe virus.

the accumulation of mir <dig> and its target genes mrnas are altered after virus infection
next, we analyzed whether the induction of p-mir164a::gus by virus infection also correlated with the levels of mature mir <dig> and its mrna targets. the accumulation of mature mir <dig> in infected and mock-treated plants was detected and quantified by northern-blot analysis. the hybridization with a mir <dig> probe was measured using a radioactivity-scanning device and normalized based on the amount of ethidium bromide-stained rrna. the amount of mir <dig> in mock-treated plants was arbitrarily set as  <dig> , and the rest of the data were computed relatively to these plants. as previously, l <dig> and l <dig> transgenic lines tissues were used to maintain the genetic background even though endogenous mirs were quantified. figure 4a shows mir <dig> accumulation from two biological replicates of mock-treated plants , tmv-cg, and ormv-infected plants. figure 4b shows the mean values of mir <dig> quantification of two to four biological replicas, including the data shown on panel a. mir <dig> accumulation increased after infection with both tobamoviruses. the higher mir <dig> accumulation after infection might be due, at least partially, to the increase in p-mir164a transcriptional activity  since mir164b/c might also contribute to this observation.

finally the effect of virus infection on mir <dig> activity was analyzed by measuring mir target accumulation by qrt-pcr using sets of primers annealing at both sides of the mir recognition site in order to only detect complete uncut mrna targets . even though, no changes in cuc <dig> mrna levels were detected after infections, cuc <dig> mrna accumulated to higher levels in plants infected with both tobamoviruses .

in conclusion, even though there was an induction of p-mir164a expression and pre-mir164a and mir <dig> accumulation upon infection, the mrna levels of cuc <dig> mrna target were also raised  <cit> . these results suggest that, in spite of the p-mir164a transcriptional induction, the viral infection caused a reduction of mir <dig> activity as a final outcome.

effects of hormone treatments on p-mir164a expression
virus infections were reported to alter the concentration of phytohormones such as auxin, gibberellin and abscisic acid   <cit> . as in silico analysis identified putative gibberellin and aba responsive consensus elements within p-mir164a , we analyzed whether p-mir164a activity changed after hormone treatments. p-mir164a::gus transgenic lines  and control 35s::gus plants were sprayed with aba, indole-acetic acid , or gibberellic acid  solutions as well as with water as a control. first, we determined that p-mir164a::gus plants treated with hormones showed a gus staining tissue pattern similar to that of mock-treated plants . figure 5a shows that gus activity significantly increased after ga <dig> treatments in l <dig>  while l <dig> showed a similar trend. no significant difference in p-mir164a activity was observed in plants upon exposure to aba or iaa. as expected, gus activity did not change in 35s::gus plants after treatment, showing that hormone treatments could not induce this promoter. effectiveness of all hormone treatments was confirmed by rt-pcr amplification of known hormone-responsive mrnas . therefore, we concluded that ga <dig> treatment elevated the activity of p-mir164a promoter.

discussion
there is increasing information regarding the molecular events triggered after a plant virus infection including changes inplant gene expression, metabolism and development  <cit> . some of these events may be required for the proper virus replication and spread, some may be plant responses and others may be just a side effect of virus infection. in turn, some of these alterations might be responsible for virus symptoms. different molecules emerged as candidates to modulate this complex interaction, and a group of them are mirs  <cit> . accordingly, mirs accumulation and activity were shown to be altered by virus infection and/or by the transgenic expression of viral proteins  <cit> . different hypotheses, all of them involving post-transcriptional regulation, have been proposed  <cit> . furthermore, this process may occur in the cytoplasm, after mir nuclear processing by dcl <dig> and subsequent nucleo-cytoplasmic transport  <cit> .

in this work we showed for the first time that virus infections and ga <dig> treatment lead to enhanced transcriptional activity of p-mir164a thus revealing a novel mode of viral interference with plant mir biogenesis.

at early stages of leaf development, we showed that p-mir164a has a spatial expression pattern similar to the one reported by other authors  <cit> . next, we further expanded the characterization to fully developed organs . one interesting observation was the identification of the highest p-mr164a activity on the vascular tissue of plants at stages  <dig>  to  <dig>  . this time point correspond, according to boyes et al,  <cit>  just after the switch of the vegetative to the reproductive growth, and when several processes are initiated, including changes in hormone levels. this switch is also relevant for plant-virus interactions since it coincides with the time point when virus replication is transiently arrested, as reported by lunello et al  <cit> . we also detected a strong reduction in p-mir164a activity at plant developmental stage  <dig>  that correlated with a reported decrease in mature mir <dig> levels and an increase of its target gene oresara- <dig>  mrna , which positively regulates aging-induced cell death in leaves  <cit> .

upon ormv infection, p-mir164a::gus transgenic lines  accumulated higher levels of gus, showing that virus infection could directly or indirectly interfere with mir164a regulation at the transcriptional level . supporting these results, pre-mir164a accumulation also increased after viral infection in the same set of lines . nevertheless, the increased pre-mir164a accumulation could be as well explained by a change in the nuclear precursor rate processing. this possibility is unlikely in view of our gus activity results although a partial contribution cannot be ruled out . furthermore, the ormv infection elevated approximately by six fold the expression of the endogenous pre-mir164a compared to the mock-inoculated plants in wild type col  <dig> plants  also indicating that the transcriptional induction of p-mir164a is not affected by a genomic positional effect in the transgenic plants nor an artifact of the transgenic lines . in sum, our results showed that mirs promoter activation should be considered to explain changes in mirs abundance during virus infection. along this line, csorva et al  <cit>  demonstrated that tobamovirus infection increases mirs accumulation in hst- <dig> mutant plants  as well as in wild type plants. in this case, the increase in mir accumulation may be due to a transcriptional induction rather than a post-transcriptional regulation, given the fact that the ptgs suppressor and mirs are located in different cell compartments. moreover this data is similar to the increase of mir transcription in response to different abiotic stresses reported by liu et al  <cit> .

interestingly, our results show that the most severe tobamovirus, ormv, significantly altered p-mir164a activity  and produced a major increase in mir <dig> and in its target cuc <dig> mrna accumulation . the fact that cuc <dig>  was altered upon infection is in agreement with the observed degree of alteration of both target mrnas in triple mir164abc mutant lines, since in rosette leaves cuc <dig> was the more responsive  <cit> . on the other hand, infection by a less severe virus such as tmv-cg raised to a lesser extent  p-mir164a activity and mature mir <dig> and cuc <dig> mrna accumulation. these results evidence a correlation between infection severity and mirs pathways alteration. this agrees with a correlation recently reported between the increased accumulation of a set of selected mirs and symptom severity of tobacco plants separately infected with six different tobamoviruses  and, all together, this data may suggests a role of mirs alteration on symptom severity. similar results were obtained in cucumber mosaic virus/tomato interactions by cillo et al.  <cit> .

even when we showed that virus infection elevates p-mir164a activity and increases pre-mir164a and mature mir <dig> accumulation, we detected higher levels of cuc <dig> mrna target in rosettes leaves . this reduction in mir activity is in agreement with reported data and was mostly explained by the action of viral ptgs suppressors  <cit> . tobamovirus ptgs suppressors  mostly act by inhibiting the assembly of the risc complex, although they cannot affect already srna-loaded risc complexes as other stronger suppressors do  <cit> . besides, their mode of action involves at least two functions: interference with srnas methylation and srnas binding  <cit> . this binding and sequestration of srnas as double-strand inactive forms is a common strategy of viral ptgs suppressors that might allow the stabilization and thus the increase of srnas accumulation and at same time reducing the mir activity level  <cit> .

as it was mentioned before, phytohormones accumulation change after virus infection  <cit>  and putative phytohormone-responsive elements were detected in the p-mir164a sequence by in silico analysis . consequently, hormones could be one of the candidate molecules mediating the linkage between viral infection and p-mir164a induction. in agreement, our data indicated that ga <dig> treatment induced p-mir164a promoter . additionally, guo et al  <cit>  reported that naa treatment produces a modest induction of mir <dig> and a reduction of nac <dig> target mrna in arabidopsis roots. accordingly, it is reasonable to propose that mir promoter activity could be altered after viral infection by changes in phytohormones levels. furthermore, several of the mirs whose accumulation are modified by tobamovirus infection were shown to be directly or indirectly related to phytohormone regulation  or directly regulated by hormones  <cit> . therefore, it makes sense to propose a crosstalk between hormone and mirs abundance alterations  after virus infection. in fact, recent work by navarro et al  <cit>  reported a link between mirs, hormones and pathogen resistance.

the mechanism of p-mir <dig> induction by virus infection and its implications are still unknown. the alteration of p-mir <dig> activity upon infection implies that virus infections mediate a nuclear modification but, as there are no reports of tobamovirus encoded proteins with nuclear activity, this could be the result of an indirect effect. similarly, it is known that tmv infection causes a change in the nuclear localization of a putative regulator of auxin response involved in plant development that in turn alters auxin-mediated gene regulation  <cit> . we cannot rule out the existence of a feedback regulation of p-mir164a activity mediated by cuc <dig> target mrna abundance. as previously mentioned, viral infection could decrease mir activity by its ptgs suppressors, increasing the mir-targets level. consequently, p-mir164a might be induced to produce more mir to restore target accumulation. however, since the observed outcome was a higher level of mir-target after infection this suggests that ptgs suppressor action was stronger  than the resulting outcome of p-mir elevation of the transcription level at the time point analyzed. additional evidence is needed to address this point. although the biological role of p-mir164a induction during virus infection is still unknown, the transcription component described here must be taken into account when exploring the mir role in host-pathogen interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our work showed for the first time that, in addition the already described post-transcriptional effects, virus infection can interfere with mirs pathways at a transcriptional level. further experiments are required to establish which proportion of the induced mir <dig> accumulation is due to the transcriptional effect, which is the precise mechanism involved and to uncover which is the biological relevance of this transcriptional component.
