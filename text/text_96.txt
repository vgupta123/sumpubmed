BACKGROUND
throughout east asia, there is a strikingly high prevalence of cholangiocarcinoma  in regions where the human liver fluke is endemic. no stronger link occurs between a human malignancy and infection with a eukaryotic parasite than that between cca and infection with the liver fluke, opisthorchis viverrini   <cit> . indeed, the international agency for research on cancer  recognizes o. viverrini as a 'category i carcinogen'  <cit> . cca is highly prevalent in northeast thailand, areas where uncooked cyprinoid fish are a dietary staple. due to poor sanitation practices and inadequate sewerage infrastructure, o. viverrini-infected people pass the trematode's eggs in their feces into natural bodies of fresh water. aquatic snails, which represent the first intermediate hosts of o. viverrini, ingest the eggs from which the miracidia undergo asexual reproduction before a population of the free swimming larval stage, called a cercaria, is shed from the infected snails. the cercaria then locates a cyprinoid fish, encysts in the fins, skin and musculature of the fish, and becomes a metacercaria. the metacercarial stage is infective to humans and other fish-eating mammals. infection is acquired when people ingest raw or undercooked fish. the young adult worm escapes from the metacercarial cyst in the upper small intestine and then migrates through the ampulla of vater into the biliary tree, where it develops to sexual maturity over four to six weeks, thus completing the life cycle. the adult worms, which are hermaphrodites, can live for many years in the liver, even decades, shedding as many as  <dig> eggs per day which pass out via bile into the chyme and feces  <cit> .

in thailand, ~ <dig> million people are infected with o. viverrini. despite widespread chemotherapy with the compound, praziquantel, the prevalence of o. viverrini in some endemic areasapproaches 70% . moreover, in thailand, liver cancer is the most prevalent of the malignant/fatal neoplasias, and the prevalence of cca in regions in which the parasite is endemic is unprecedented  <cit> .

while sexual reproduction takes place in the mature adults of o. viverrini within the bile ducts, asexual reproduction in the snail leads to a massive increase in the number of infectious cercarial stages exiting and swimming off to locate then infect the fish host. the adult fluke is a diploid organism which reproduces by meiosis; self fertilization of the male and female organs occurs, but it is believed that cross-fertilization between adjacent adult worms is the normal pattern. although the genome size of o. viverrini has not yet been reported, it is known to have six pairs of chromosomes, i.e. 2n =  <dig>  <cit> , distinct from the closely related liver fluke, clonorchis sinensis, which possesses 2n =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit> .

despite its public health importance, only a small number of o. viverrini sequences  have been available in public databases prior to the present study. characterization of the genes expressed in this organism should provide a foundation for elucidating the immunopathogenesis of cca, particularly the molecular mechanisms by which infection with this parasite induces cancer. indeed, secreted proteins of o. viverrini induce hyper-proliferation of cells  in vitro  <cit> , implying that carcinogenesis may not be just a consequence of chronic inflammation, but that the parasite actively secretes gene products which initiate neoplasia.

here, we undertake gene discovery for o. viverrini after the construction of a cdna library and characterization of ~ <dig>  expressed sequence tags  from this carcinogenic parasite. a similar dataset exists for c. sinensis  <cit> , which, despite its widespread prevalence  <cit> , is not recognized as a 'class i carcinogen'  <cit> . therefore, we compared the available transcriptomic dataset from o. viverrini with those from c. sinensis, and from several other flatworms, both free-living and parasitic in humans.

RESULTS
features of the dataset
of  <dig>  randomly selected ests, a total of  <dig>  yielded acceptably high quality sequences. these in turn were clustered into contigs, establishing a catalogue of  <dig>  non-redundant ovaes. this apparently represents the largest dataset thus far for any of the liver flukes. table  <dig> summarizes the key features of the dataset. of note is that the identities for  <dig>   of these ovaes could not yet be established, as they did not share sequence homology  with any other predicted or known molecules in public databases, including dbest which contains  <dig>  ests from the related liver fluke, c. sinensis  <cit> . the average insert size of these novel ovaes was  <dig> nt;  <dig> of these  <dig>  ovaes had insert sizes of less than  <dig> nt. these ests may in fact be o. viverrini-specific or even digenetic fluke-specific genes. a similar situation currently pertains to the human blood fluke where a large percentage of known transcripts, and indeed proteins, are assumed to be schistosoma- or indeed phylum platyhelminthes-specific  <cit> . if the o. viverrini genome has  <dig>  protein-coding genes   <cit> , and if each of the  <dig>  o. viverrini contigs represented a protein coding gene, these newly discovered genes from the adult stage of o. viverrini are predicted to represent ~14% of the entire transcriptome of this liver fluke. est sequences described herein have been deposited in dbest under accession numbers el618683–el <dig> 

ausable sequences were determined using seqclean – sequences that were removed were either non-recombinant, of low complexity and/or quality and those of <  <dig> nt in length.

abundantly expressed transcripts
after manual filtering of  <dig> ribosomal sequences, the  <dig> most abundantly represented mrnas encoded proteins with known or unknown functions, including one contig that did not have homologues in any public databases . abundant contigs encoded proteins involved in a range of physiological functions which are considered essential to parasitism, such as anaerobic respiration   <cit> , reproduction  and detoxification of xenobiotic compounds . other abundantly expressed ovaes encoded proteins of likely key relevance to the host-parasite relationship, and included proteases , saposin-like proteins and dynein light chains. homologues of some of the most abundantly represented ovaes were also highly represented in c. sinensis ests , whereas others were uniquely over-expressed in each species. in particular, structural molecules, including tubulin and actin-binding proteins, were among the  <dig> most abundant clones from c. sinensis  <cit> , but were not highly represented in the dataset from o. viverrini. an in-depth comparison of the o. viverrini and c. sinensis datasets is presented below.

anon-ribosomal sequences only were used in this analysis.

bsequence identity was low but diagnostic motifs of gag were detected over  <dig> amino acids.

gene ontology assignments of ests from o. viverrini and related flukes
three hundred and eighty three  of the total  <dig>  ovaes  could be assigned go classifications . the most abundant groups represented under the molecular function category were linked to binding , catalytic activity  and structural molecule activity . other sequences of interest identified in this category were inferred to relate to caspase activity  and transporter activity . the most abundant groups represented under the biological process category corresponded to physiological processes , cellular processes  and unknown biological processes .

we then undertook a comparative assessment of go assignments of sequences from o. viverrini and two other trematode parasites of humans in asia – the liver fluke, c. sinensis  and the blood fluke, s. japonicum . in general, the percentages of ests allocated to each go category among these three flukes was similar . however, some categories were over- or under-represented in one species. for example, contigs encoding structural proteins were ~four times more abundantly represented in the two liver flukes than in s. japonicum, whereas contigs encoding motor proteins were ~three times more abundant in o. viverrini than they were in c. sinensis or s. japonicum. sample sizes were too small to determine whether these differences were statistically significant. both structural and motor proteins are important components of fluke teguments  <cit> , playing roles in surface maintenance and turnover in schistosomes  <cit>  and liver flukes  <cit> . therefore, these molecular differences might reflect the specialised niches and physiological requirements of each parasite. from just  <dig> ovaes,  <dig> different contigs had orfs encoding components of the dynein complex of motor proteins, a category of motion- related, and surface and gut-localized ef-hand motif- containing antigens which, at least in schistosomes, represent potent allergens and targets of protective immunological responses  <cit> .

evolutionary relationships between o. viverrini and other platyhelminths
to assess the evolutionary relationships between o. viverrini and other platyhelminths , we used simitri  <cit>  to plot the relative similarities of predicted polypeptide sequences . ovaes shared most sequence identity with sequences from c. sinensis , and s. japonicum . ovaes were less similar to sequences from the free-living turbellarian platyhelminth, schmidtea mediterranea   <cit> , which was not altogether surprising given the phylogenetic distance between parasitic and free-living members of the phylum platyhelminthes  <cit> . the bulk of this phylum  represents a monophyletic group based on 18s rdna sequences  <cit>  and morphological characters  <cit> , and is often referred to as the rhabditophora  <cit> . therefore, the members of the rhabditophora are considered to be more closely related to each other than to other turbellarian clades, such as the polycladida  <cit> . a total of  <dig> ovaes had homologues in the ests from the two parasitic flukes but not in the free-living schmidtea , suggesting that at least some of these are parasitism-specific genes. thirty-three  of the conserved parasitic fluke genes were novel and did not have homologues of known function. predicted proteins of known function included homologues of legumain, fatty acid binding proteins, myoglobin and potential anti-inflammatory proteins such as ly6/upar domain-containing proteins. of the parasitic fluke-specific genes,  <dig> encoded orfs with n-terminal signal sequences;  <dig> of these ovaes had homologues in just s. japonicum and  <dig> had homologues in both s. japonicum and c. sinensis.

secreted and membrane proteins
we conducted an analysis of orfs containing an n-terminal signal peptide or signal anchor. a total of  <dig> ovaes contained orfs with signal sequences. the dataset was divided into three categories – sequences that were  novel;  platyhelminth-specific;  conserved across multiple phyla. novel sequences constituted  <dig> % of the total, but only  <dig> % of them encoded proteins with a signal sequence. conserved sequences constituted  <dig> % of the total, and  <dig> % of these encoded proteins with signal sequences. finally, the sequences inferred to be platyhelminth-specific accounted for  <dig> % of the total dataset, but  <dig> % of these encoded proteins with a signal sequence . it should be noted, however, that not all of the ovaes contained full-length nt sequences, and therefore the true percentage of sequences with signal peptides cannot be definitively inferred in the absence of full genome coverage.

sequences encoding novel secreted and/or membrane proteins  may be of particular interest for the development of vaccines and drugs, because the absence of host homologues enhances the prospect for therapeutic margins of safety. ovaes encoding secreted/membrane proteins involved in many aspects of parasitism were identified , and some of these are discussed in the following section. two of the ovaes presented in table  <dig>  which are inferred to encode transforming growth factor β receptor  and calumenin, were more similar in sequence to vertebrate proteins from both the non-redundant and dbest databases than they were to platyhelminth sequences, suggesting that they have evolved independently to bind host ligands. these results are reminiscent of reports of the schistosome transcriptome where, for example, receptors for mammalian hormones, including insulin, fibroblast growth factor and cytokines, have been hypothesized to bind host molecules .

proteases
as with other parasitic helminth transcriptomes  <cit> , proteins with catalytic activity were abundantly represented in the o. viverrini dataset . many of these enzymes encoded endo- and exo-proteases belonging to established families , but which have not yet been described from liver flukes . of particular interest were members of the s1a serine protease family with sequence similarity to kallikrein and chymotrypsin, and, therefore, potentially involved in feeding or tissue migration  <cit> . other proteases included homologues of enzymes that digest hemoglobin in blood-feeding helminths, including cathepsin d-like aspartic and cathepsin b-like cysteine proteases  <cit>  as well as an asparaginyl endopeptidase, which is known to activate the gastrodermal cathepsin b enzyme, and probably other gut proteases in s. mansoni  <cit> . we also identified o. viverrini homologues of the cell death enzyme, caspase- <dig>  and the neutral cysteine protease from the tegument of schistosomes, calpain.

multiple membrane-spanning proteins
predicted proteins with multiple membrane spanning domains were identified. tetraspanins, an abundantly represented family of four-transmembrane proteins in the tegument of schistosomes  <cit> , were identified from o. viverrini . these proteins are thought to stabilize the cell membrane by forming a network of interactions, called the tetraspanin web, with other membrane-bound and -associated proteins, particularly on the surface of cells of the immune system  <cit> . a homologue of the six-transmembrane domain family of water channel proteins, aquaporin  <cit> , was identified. seven transmembrane proteins are common drug targets  <cit> , and at least three distinct members of this family were identified, including receptors for dystroglycan and lamin b, and a protein with homology to a the dc-stamp receptor from the surface of dendritic cells .

host-parasite "cross talk"
parasitic helminths receive host-derived signals for growth and reproduction via surface receptors for host ligands,  <cit> . convergent evolution of extracellular parasite proteins to promote their interactions with host tissues is well documented  <cit> , and we identified o. viverrini orfs encoding membrane and secreted proteins, some of which were clearly more similar to vertebrate than to invertebrate homologues . transforming growth factor-beta  regulates cell growth and differentiation and is acquired on the cell surface by specific tgf-β receptors  <cit> . an orf encoding a member of the tgf-β receptor type ib family was identified in o. viverrini. the orf included a  <dig> amino acid insertion absent from other type i tgf-β receptors, except for tr <dig> from the hydatid tapeworms of the genus echinococcus   <cit> . however, these two insertions did not share sequence identity . unlike many of the ests identified for which the closest homologues were from parasitic trematodes, the o. viverrini tgf-β receptor type i was divergent from smrk-i of s. mansoni  <cit>  and instead grouped more closely with proteins from echinococcus multilocularis and from parasitic and free-living nematodes . in pairwise sequence comparisons, however, the o. viverrini partial orf was more similar to pig and macaque sequences  than it was to echinococcus tr <dig>  or smrk <dig> . smrk-i is known to bind to human tgf-β  <cit> , suggesting that the o. viverrini receptor might also bind host growth factors for maturation and reproduction. another ovae encoding a protein which is potentially involved in the acquisition of host signals  for growth and development was a fibroblast growth factor  receptor substrate  <dig>  parasitic flatworms induce fibrosis   <cit> , and the parasites might acquire and utilize the host fgf that they induce for development and reproduction. indeed, schistosomes are dependent upon fgf and transferrin for growth and maturation in vitro  <cit> . of the sequences presented in table  <dig>  another ovae which shared greatest identity with vertebrate homologues, encoded for calumenin, an ef-hand calcium binding protein localized to the secretory pathway. calumenin is an inhibitor of the gamma-carboxylation system  <cit>  and is expressed in thrombin-activated thrombocytes. it has a modulating effect on the organization of the actin cytoskeleton and may be involved in the pathophysiology of thrombosis or in wound healing  <cit> . the predicted calumenin of o. viverrini was most similar to rat and frog orthologues/paralogues, suggesting that it might interact with actin on the surface of host cells which are damaged during parasite feeding and migration.

molecules associated with cancer?
o. viverrini is the major cause of cca in south-east asia  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms underlying induction of o. viverrini-induced cca are thought to be multi-factorial , but recent evidence suggests that o. viverrini secretes mitogenic proteins into host tissues  <cit> . ovaes encoding secreted proteins with prospective mitogenic activity were identified in the est dataset. of note, first, progranulin  is a pluripotent secreted growth factor that mediates cell cycle progression, cell motility  <cit>  and wound repair  <cit> . we identified an ovae  that shared sequence identity with pgrn . of particular importance is that pgrn has been implicated in regulating the proliferation of tumour cells, and its expression is up-regulated in more aggressive cancers . the kallikrein-like serine proteases are another family of enzymes whose over-expression has been linked to cancer. the expression of some kallikreins in prostate cells leads to changes indicative of an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, an important process in cancer progression  <cit> . an ovae  with sequence identity to kallikrein-like secreted proteases is present in the new o. viverrini gene catalogue. phospholipase a <dig>  regulates the provision of arachidonic acid to both cyclooxygenase- and lipoxygenase-derived eicosanoids , and the upregulation of cyclooxygenase- <dig> is thought to be an important feature of cholangiocarcinogenesis in both humans and experimental rodent models  <cit> . we identified an ovae  that encodes a secreted pla- <dig> which shared greatest sequence identity with pla- <dig> from venom of heloderma  and an est from c. sinensis . parasites utilize secreted serine proteases  <cit>  and pla-2s  <cit>  to invade host tissues, and homologues of these proteins  are potentially secreted by o. viverrini into host tissues where they might promote cell proliferation, mutagenesis and ultimately carcinogensis. ongoing studies in our laboratories are now focused on the physiological roles of these putative carcinogens in the host-parasite relationship and in cholangiocarcinogenesis induced by o. viverrini infection.

potential vaccines
digenean flukes develop through a series of morphologically and developmentally discrete stages within their mammalian hosts, and each stage can be expected to display a characteristic transcritpome, confounding efforts to develop new control measures. adult parasitic flukes are bound by an outer epithelial tegument, a structure that is widely regarded as the most vulnerable target for vaccines and drugs  <cit> . homologues and orthologues of vaccine antigens identified in the tegument  of other flatworms were identified in the o. viverrini dataset . of particular note were the membrane spanning proteins, including an orthologue of the protective tetraspanin from s. mansoni, sm-tsp- <dig>  <cit>   and the  <dig>  kda family of antigens from the schistosome tegument  <cit> . homologues of gut proteases used by blood-feeding helminths to digest their blood-meal were identified from o. viverrini, including cathepsin d-like aspartic proteases  <cit> ,  <dig> distinct papain-like cysteine proteases  <cit>  and the neutral protease, calpain, which associates with the inner tegument of schistosomes  <cit> . other potential immunogens include lipid-binding proteins which are efficacious vaccines in the rabbit model against the western liver fluke, fasciola hepatica, including saposin-like proteins  <cit>  and fatty acid-binding proteins  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this report provides the first description of gene discovery for the liver fluke o. viverrini. infection with o. viverrini is an important tropical health issue, but even more important and enigmatic is that chronic o. viverrini infection leads to the development of cca. indeed, there is no stronger link between a human parasite and cancer than that between o. viverrini and cca  <cit> . the new gene catalogue for o. viverrini represents the largest est dataset in the public domain for any species of liver fluke, and provides a platform for explorations into the molecular basis of host-helminth parasite interactions. we  <cit>  and others  <cit>  are interested in the molecules secreted into host tissues by o. viverrini that induce hyper-proliferation of biliary cells which can subsequently undergo malignant transformation. given the number of o. viverrini ests sequenced herein, it is possible that mrnas corresponding to these parasite mitogens are already present in the current dataset. proteomic analysis of proteins secreted by adult o. viverrini maintained in vitro also is underway in our laboratories, and linking peptide sequences to corresponding mrnas can be expected to be facilitated by this gene discovery program  <cit> . finally, this gene discovery information for o. viverrini should expedite molecular studies of cholangiocarcinogenesis and accelerate research focused on developing new interventions, drugs and vaccines, to control o. viverrini and related flukes.
