BACKGROUND
genome assemblies need to be anchored to chromosomes if they are to be useful for addressing important questions in genome evolution  <cit> . the time consuming and costly exercise of developing a chromosomal based assembly is often overlooked yet the benefits gained from an anchored genome are immense. knowledge of how genomes have evolved provides an understanding of the role genome organisation plays in the evolution of species, including the evolution of sex determining genes. tracing genome evolution is achieved by comparing genome organisation between species to reconstruct the most likely chromosome arrangement in a common ancestor.

until recently, ancestral karyotype reconstructions depended largely on cross-species chromosome painting, which enabled the prediction of ancestral karyotypes for eutherian mammals  <cit>  and avian macrochromosomes  <cit> . ancestral karyotype reconstructions over greater evolutionary distances are possible when chromosome painting data are combined with gene mapping and whole genome sequence data. for instance, a comparison of gene mapping data for the tammar wallaby  genome compared with anchored genome assemblies for the grey short-tailed opossum , chicken  and human permitted the first prediction of the ancestral therian  mammal karyotype  <cit> . similarly, a comparison of gene mapping data for species of turtle, crocodile, frog, salamander and snake compared with genome assemblies for chicken and human enabled the ancestral karyotype of amniotes to be predicted  <cit> . despite the prediction of the amniote protokaryotype, there are still key amniote lineages for which there are gaps in our understanding of chromosome evolution.

reptiles, excluding birds, number some  <dig>  species and present an excellent group in which to study chromosome evolution, since they display a high level of diversity in chromosome number and morphology, in the absence or presence of microchromosomes, and diversity in sex determination systems  and sex chromosomes . squamates  show a high level of karyotypic diversity, with diploid chromosome numbers ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  yet are an understudied lineage for detailed investigations into karyotypic changes. in the past, comparisons between squamate species have been limited to global levels of homology between species within the scinidae   <cit>  and gekkonidae   <cit> . more broad based studies determined homology among nine families  of squamates using four chicken chromosome paints , revealing strong conservation of these chromosomes among the ten species  <cit> . cytogenetic maps, providing the location of specific genes or dna clones on chromosomes, are available for one species of snake  and six species of lizards , - albeit the v. exanthematicus map is limited to just  <dig> genes. five squamate genomes  have been previously sequenced but only the anole has any sequence anchored to chromosomes , making it impossible to determine genome rearrangements using these sequenced species. the recently anchored painted turtle genome  has highlighted the finer scale resolution afforded by combining cytogenetic mapping with genome sequence assemblies. unlike squamates, turtle karyotypes are typically highly conserved  <cit> . the anchored turtle genome assembly uncovered many chromosomal rearrangements, challenging the previously held view of a high level of macrochromosome conservation between birds and turtles  <cit> .

squamates also display diversity in sex determination systems, varying between genetic sex determination  and temperature dependent sex determination  or even an interaction between these two systems  <cit> , with a transition from gsd to tsd recently reported in captive populations of dragon   <cit> . in squamates with gsd, independent evolution of sex chromosomes has occurred in different lineages. this is demonstrated by using chicken as a reference species: gecko z chromosome shares homology with the chicken z  <cit> ; the sand lizard z shares homology with chicken chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> ; snake z genes correspond to those on chicken chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> ; the anole x chromosome shares homology with chicken  <dig>  <cit> . two genes on chicken chromosome  <dig> have been mapped to the dragon z chromosome, although another chicken  <dig> gene maps to an autosomal microchromosome in this species, so it cannot be assumed that the entire z chromosome shares homology with chicken  <dig>  <cit> . with the exception of the anole, where  <dig> genes have been assigned to the x  <cit> , and snakes, where genes were assigned to the z based on genome sequencing or quantitative pcr  <cit> , fewer than  <dig> genes have been mapped to squamate sex chromosomes . a greater understanding of sex chromosome evolution in squamates requires more genes to be assigned to their sex chromosomes.

the genome of the central bearded dragon, a squamate from the family agamidae, has recently been sequenced and assembled into  <dig>  sequence scaffolds  <cit> . the dragon has a karyotype consisting of six pairs of macrochromosomes and ten pairs of microchromosomes   <cit> . most importantly, considerable resources for this species are available to enable this genome assembly to be anchored to chromosomes, including a bacterial artificial chromosome  library as a source of probes for molecular cytogenetic mapping and a preliminary cytogenetic map consisting of  <dig> bac clones  <cit> . an anchored genome sequence for a second squamate, along with adequate cytogenetic mapping data for five other species, provides the opportunity to reconstruct the ancestral chromosome arrangements at key points in squamate evolution.

the purpose of this study was to anchor dragon sequence to chromosomes, including the z chromosome, in order to more accurately determine the level of rearrangement between squamates, and more broadly, to trace the evolution of squamate genomes. to accomplish this task efficiently, we built on the existing dragon cytogenetic map  <cit>  by employing a strategy of cytogenetically mapping conserved anole-chicken and chicken-human gene blocks, assembling super-scaffolds based on conserved synteny and constructing comparative maps for dragon, anole and chicken genomes. we compared these maps to the more limited gene mapping data available for five other species  <cit>  to determine the make-up of ancestral squamate macrochromosomes. we have gained a greater understanding of the composition of dragon microchromosomes, including the z, and have identified a promising candidate sex determining gene.

RESULTS
we used two different approaches to map large, conserved blocks of genes to the six macrochromosomes and  <dig> microchromosomes of the dragon. with the first approach, we isolated bac clones containing genes located at the ends of either anole-chicken or human-chicken homologous synteny blocks. by assembling super-scaffolds based on conserved synteny analysis we then further extended the amount of sequence assigned to dragon chromosomes. comparative maps were then constructed by comparing the location of sequence on dragon chromosomes to that in the chicken and anole genome assemblies, enabling us to begin tracing the evolution of squamate chromosomes and determine the sequence content of the dragon z chromosome.

assignment of genome sequence to dragon autosomes
our initial approach was to isolate bac clones containing a gene located at the end of either anole-chicken or chicken-human homologous synteny blocks  with the intention that, by mapping a gene from each block, we would be able to extrapolate and assign a virtual location for all genes within the block to the chromosome from which the bac mapped. a similar approach was successfully used to anchor the tammar wallaby genome to chromosomes, where conserved gene blocks ranged in size from 30 kb to 218 mb  <cit> . we chose  <dig> of the larger  <dig> anole-chicken hsbs representing  <dig> chicken chromosomes as well as the six anole macrochromosomes and four anole linkage groups . bac clones were mapped to dragon metaphase chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridisation  . we also identified human-chicken hsbs in order to cover regions unanchored in the anole genome assembly, particularly the microchromosomes, and mapped  <dig> of these to dragon chromosomes. bac clones were end-sequenced to determine their corresponding location in the dragon genome sequence assembly. these data were then added to the existing dragon cytogenetic map  <cit> . bac clones mapped and end-sequenced as part of other unpublished studies were also included on this map to bring the total number of  <dig> bacs mapped to dragon macrochromosomes  and  <dig> bacs mapped to microchromosomes . each dragon microchromosome can be distinctly identified by at least one anchor bac  <cit> . using homology of dragon microchromosome anchor bacs with chicken microchromosomes as a guide,  <dig> of the  <dig> bacs representing hsbs mapping to microchromosomes were assigned to a specific dragon microchromosome . synteny of microchromosomes was conserved between dragon and chicken.table  <dig> estimated portion of genome sequence anchored to dragon macrochromosomes

mapping of two bacs for  <dig> different sequence scaffolds tested the accuracy of the genome assembly, with bacs for  <dig> of these scaffolds supporting the accuracy of the assembly. however, three scaffolds  highlighted potential assembly errors as bacs corresponding to different regions of these scaffolds mapped to different chromosomes.

we generated  <dig> super-scaffolds from the dragon genome sequence, joining scaffolds containing contiguous genes when compared to the chicken and anole genomes, assuming that regions displaying conserved synteny between chicken and anole are likely to be conserved as a region in dragon. the super-scaffolds ranged in size from the  <dig>  to  <dig> ,095 bp. the size of the super-scaffolds was determined by adding the size of the individual scaffolds making up a super-scaffold. for example, super-scaffold 15-3- <dig> located on chromosome  <dig>  covers a total of  <dig> ,961 bp because scf <dig> is  <dig> ,090 bp, scf <dig> is  <dig> ,202 bp and scf <dig> is  <dig>  bp in length. this approach enabled much larger regions of sequence to be assigned to chromosomes than the hsb approach. an example is given in fig.  <dig> of a super-scaffold  containing orthologues of chicken chromosome  <dig> and anole chromosome  <dig> genes. the large anole-chicken hsb_ <dig>  enabled scf <dig>  scf <dig>  scf <dig> and scf <dig> to be linked while the shared synteny between anole and chicken linked scf <dig> and scf <dig>  mapping of bacs 74f <dig> and 121a <dig> would only have assigned two hsbs  to dragon chromosome  <dig> whereas the super-scaffolding approach enabled four additional hsbs to be given a chromosomal assignment.table  <dig> supers-scaffolds anchored by two or more bacs

bac clones unique to several of the largest super-scaffolds that had not previously been localized, either by the hsb approach described above or in other studies, were also isolated and mapped. eleven super-scaffolds with sequence scaffolds assigned to chromosomes by two or more bacs were used to determine the validity of the super-scaffolding approach . seven super-scaffolds, including the largest one, were supported by mapping data. however, four super-scaffolds had bacs mapping to different chromosomes, indicating rearrangements have occurred since the divergence of anole and dragon from a common ancestor. this means there is either a derived arrangement in dragon, or there are potential assembly errors.

by using the size of the scaffold and, where appropriate, the size of the super-scaffolds, in conjunction with the predicted size of each chromosome  <cit> , we were able to estimate the amount of genome sequence assigned to each chromosome . overall, approximately 42 % of the genome sequence was assigned to chromosomes using the super-scaffolding approach.

the super-scaffolding has provided an innovative approach to anchor a large portion of genome sequence to chromosomes for a genome assembly consisting of hundreds of thousands of sequence scaffolds. by doubling the number of bac clones mapped to chromosomes since the first generation map  <cit> , and integrating bac end-sequence with the genomic sequence, we physically anchored approximately 42 % of the genome to each of the  <dig> chromosome pairs. as a comparison,  <dig> bacs were required to anchor 60 % of the anole genome assembly to chromosomes, yet this resulted in sequence being anchored to only half the microchromosomes  <cit> . however, our super-scaffolding approach is not without limitations, as we assume that there have been no rearrangements within these super-scaffolds in the dragon lineage. our results indicate that this assumption is likely to be true for the majority of super-scaffolds but not all. we also have no information on gene order within super-scaffolds, only an assumption that gene content has been conserved. although the super-scaffolding approach provides an efficient, cost-effective means of assigning sequence to chromosomes, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of this approach when interpreting the data.

comparative maps of the dragon autosomes
comparative maps of each dragon macrochromosome were constructed by comparing the location of mapped scaffolds or super-scaffolds on dragon chromosomes to their corresponding location in the anole and chicken genomes. each of the dragon macrochromosomes was, for the most part, homologous to the same numbered macrochomosome in the anole lizard, meaning that dragon chromosome  <dig> was homologous to anole chromosome  <dig> and so forth. however, intrachromosomal rearrangements were detected on all macrochromosomes except chromosome  <dig>  more importantly, there were  <dig> interchromosomal rearrangements detected between these two species, distributed across five macrochromosomes . this is a conservative number as substantial proportions of both genomes remain unanchored.

the lack of intrachromosomal rearrangements detected between dragon and anole chromosome  <dig> is an interesting observation. the short arm and part of the long arm  share homology with the chicken z chromosome . this region appears to have been conserved largely as an intact region for over  <dig> million years  <cit> . furthermore, the order of up to six chicken z genes  is basically conserved between turtle , crocodile , representative squamates   <cit>  and even palaeognathous birds such as the ostrich  and elegant crested tinamou   <cit> . this suggests that this gene order may have been present in the common ancestor of birds and reptiles  <cit> . there may be a feature of this chromosome, beyond its role in sex determination in birds, that has made it less susceptible to rearrangement. however, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of drawing conclusions from the mapping of only several genes between species. it is also important to consider the possibility that the assignment of more sequence to either the dragon or anole chromosome  <dig> may reveal intrachromosomal rearrangements.

there was limited scope for comparison of dragon and anole microchromosomes as sequence has only been anchored to six of the  <dig> anole microchromosomes. all six anole microchromosomes share homology with dragon microchromosomes. the ancestral iguanian karyotype is predicted to have consisted of  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes as is observed in the anole lizard. the dragon arrangement of ten pairs has been hypothesized to be the result of fusion of microchromosomes giving rise to the reduced number  <cit> . the presence of interstitial telomere signals on dragon microchromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> supports this hypothesis  <cit> . our mapping data suggests the fusion of a microchromosome containing chicken chromosome  <dig> orthologues and presumably a microchromosome with homology to chicken chromosome  <dig> . the other fusion is possibly between two microchromosomes  with homology to chicken chromosome  <dig> 

previously, the dragon-chicken comparative map had reported dragon microchromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> sharing homology with chicken macrochromosomes  <cit> . this was based on blastn searches of dragon bac-end sequences against the anole genome. we have shown that this is incorrect and that all but one microchromosome in dragon share homology with chicken microchromosomes. the exception is dragon chromosome  <dig>  which has homology to chicken 4p. interestingly, chicken 4p is predicted to have been a microchromosome in the amniote ancestor  <cit> .

reconstruction of ancestral squamate macrochromosomes
by comparing the dragon-anole-chicken comparative maps to the molecular cytogenetic data available for five other squamates , we reconstructed the events leading to the squamate, toxicoferan and iguanian ancestral macrochromosome arrangements.

uno et al.  <cit>  predicted the composition of the ancestral amniote macrochromosomes based on comparisons of extant representatives from different vertebrate lineages. the ancestral amniote karyotype was predicted to consist of  <dig> pairs of macrochromosomes and at least  <dig> pairs of microchromosomes  <cit> . integration of our new data with these studies suggests that a microchromosome, homologous to chicken  <dig>  fissioned into three fragments that subsequently fused with other chromosomes. several other rearrangements are common to all squamates , and suggest the common ancestor had a karyotype consisting of  <dig> pairs of macrochromosomes as shown in fig.  <dig> and an unknown number of microchromosomes. additional file  <dig> demonstrates the derivation of the ancestral squamate macrochromosomes. for instance, one part of the fissioned microchromosome sharing homology with chicken chromosome  <dig> is present on the same chromosome as ancestral amniote chromosome  <dig>  in the hokou gecko, sand lizard, japanese four-striped snake, water monitor lizard and anole , suggesting that they fused in the ancestral squamate. similarly, genes corresponding to anamn  <dig> and anamn  <dig> are located on the same chromosome in all squamate species for which there is cytogenetic mapping data, suggesting the fusion of these two chromosomes in the ancestral squamate.fig.  <dig> reconstruction of the squamate ancestral macrochromosomes. the predicted karyotype for the amniote and archosauromorpha  ancestor is based on uno et al.  <cit> . only microchromosomes relevant to squamate macrochromosome evolution have been included. boxes in grey indicate the events  leading to the predicted karyotype for the squamata, toxicofera, iguania and ophidia ancestors. the reconstructed chromosomes have been colour-coded for homology to chicken chromosomes



comparative cytogenetic mapping from seven squamate species indicates that at least five more fusion events characterise the toxicofera, to give rise to an ancestor with seven macrochromosomes . four of the five rearrangements involved the fusion of two macrochromosomes . the fifth fusion was between a microchromosome homologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> and a macrochromosome homologous to the short arm of chicken chromosome  <dig>  genes orthologous to chicken chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> are located on the same chromosome in all toxiferan species studied to date but are on separate chromosomes in the hokou gecko and sand lizard . subsequently, fusion of a macrochromosome sharing homology with chicken 1q and a macrochromosome homologous to chicken chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  gave rise to an iguanian ancestor with six macrochromosomes, similar to those observed in dragon, anole and butterfly lizard . the highly conserved snake karyotypes, usually consisting of eight pairs of macrochromosomes  <cit> , including the z, can be derived by fission of the toxicoferan ancestral macrochromosome that shared homology with the short arm of chicken  <dig> and the long arm of chicken chromosome  <dig> .

previously, srikulnath et al.  <cit> , proposed a sequence of events leading to the rearrangements observed between members of the toxicofera clade: butterfly lizard, water monitor lizard and japanese four-striped snake. however, it remained unresolved whether the butterfly lizard chromosome  <dig> was derived from a fusion of two macrochromosomes corresponding to monitor lizard chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and snake chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> or whether the reverse was true and there had been a fission event to give rise to the two chromosomes in the monitor lizard and snake. we are able to show from comparsions of cytogenetic mapping data across squamates that there was most likely a fusion event in the iguanian ancestor, giving rise to the configuration for chromosome  <dig> in butterfly lizard, dragon and anole . this same study could also not distinguish whether a fusion or fission event was responsible for genes homologous to butterfly lizard chromosome  <dig> and water monitor lizard chromosome  <dig> being split among two chromosomes in the japanese four striped snake  <cit> . the most parsimonious explanation from our analysis, based on the phylogeny of toxicofera presented in additional file  <dig>  is a fission event in the ophidian ancestor . in the gecko and sand lizard, genes homologous to chicken 1p and 4q are on separate chromosomes but in all toxicoferan species with available data, at least some chicken 4q genes, if not all, are located on the same chromosome as chicken 1p genes. this suggests that there was a fusion of these two chromosomes in the toxicoferan ancestor. it appears there has been a fission in the japanese four-striped snake to distribute these genes across two chromosomes, leaving the snake chromosome  <dig> with chicken 1p and a small region homologous to chicken 4q and snake chromosome  <dig> homologous to the remainder of chicken 4q .

these first squamate macrochromosome reconstructions give context for finer scale analysis of rearrangements between species. from comparative maps, it is obvious that there are many differences between species, even though gene content of macrochromosomes is largely conserved. examining the evolutionary history of microchromosomes in these species would be similarly interesting, particularly because it appears that the fusion of microchromosomes, either with macrochromosomes or other microchromosomes, often leads to the differences in karyology observed between species. for example, the fusion of microchromosomes, either to each other and/or to macrochromosomes, accounts for the reduction in microchromosome number in the dragon from that observed in the iguanian ancestor, the greatly reduced number of microchromosomes in the sand lizard  <cit> , and the absence of microchromosomes in the hokou gecko  <cit> . unfortunately, assignment of genes or sequence to specific microchromosomes for most squamates is lacking at this stage. it is crucial for future work to focus on the gene content of microchromosomes if we are to gain a more detailed understanding of squamate karyotype evolution.

anchoring sequence to the sex chromosomes
previously,  <dig> kbp of sequence had been assigned to dragon sex chromosomes, which included no genes with a known role in sex determination or differentiation pathways  <cit> . hence, an important reason behind anchoring sequence to dragon chromosomes was to assign more sequence to the sex chromosomes and identify potential sex determining genes. ezaz et al.  <cit>  assigned several bac clones to dragon sex chromosomes that contained two genes  whose orthologues map to chicken chromosome  <dig>  however, a third gene whose orthologue maps to chicken chromosome  <dig>  rspo <dig>  is autosomal in the dragon. in the dragon genome assembly, orthologues of genes from chicken chromosome  <dig> are spread across  <dig> genome scaffolds. we mapped bacs corresponding to five of these scaffolds, with two mapping to chromosome  <dig>  and three  mapping to the same microchromosome as rspo <dig>  . to date, the only genes orthologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> confirmed to be on the dragon sex chromosomes are the two originally reported  <cit> , rcc <dig>  and oprd <dig> . this means that only a small fragment of the genome orthologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> is on the dragon sex chromosomes, leaving the rest of the gene content of the sex chromosomes unresolved.fig.  <dig> dragon genome scaffolds with homology to chicken chromosome  <dig>  each dragon scaffold is indicated in a different colour and the arrangement of these scaffolds on chicken chromosome  <dig> is shown. one scaffold maps to the dragon z chromosome, two map to chromosome  <dig>  four map to the same microchromosome and the remainder are unmapped . asterisks mark the location of genes within a scaffold that have been mapped



from the list of scaffolds located on microchromosomes, we identified three scaffolds containing genes involved in the sex differentiation pathway: wnt <dig> , cyp19a <dig>  and nr5a <dig> . the scaffold containing cyp19a <dig>  was identified as being located on microchromosome  <dig> . the bacs corresponding to the other two scaffolds were used in fish experiments with a bac  previously mapped to dragon sex chromosomes  <cit> . the wnt <dig> scaffold bac  mapped to an autosomal microchromosome  whereas the nr5a <dig> scaffold bac  was localized to the sex chromosomes . this scaffold shares homology with chicken chromosome  <dig>  we then proceeded to identify all scaffolds with homology to chicken chromosome  <dig>  bac end sequence for 150h <dig> connects scf <dig>  and scf <dig> . scf <dig>  is assigned to the sex chromosomes by bac 67d <dig> , bringing the total amount of new sequence assigned to the z chromosome to  <dig>  mbp and consisting of at least  <dig> genes. furthermore, exons of the gene cntrl link scf <dig> to unmapped scf <dig> , which also shares homology with chicken chromosome  <dig>  the 3’ exons of cntrl are located at the end of scf <dig> and the 5’ exons are at the start of scf <dig>  suggesting that these two scaffolds co-locate on the sex chromosomes in dragon. this brings the total amount of sequence assigned by these four scaffolds to the z chromosome to  <dig>  mbp and at least  <dig> genes. therefore, our proposed order of scaffolds on the z chromosome is scf <dig> followed by scf <dig> and scf <dig> but we cannot determine whether scf <dig> precedes scf <dig> or follows scf <dig>  in all cases, bacs corresponding to sex chromosome scaffolds mapped to both the z and w chromosomes in females .fig.  <dig> dragon scaffolds with homology to chicken chromosome  <dig>  a comparison of gene order on chicken chromosome  <dig> and four scaffolds on dragon z chromosome . mapping of bacs corresponding to z scaffolds scf <dig> and scf <dig>  and scf <dig>  with the bac 3l <dig>  previously mapped to dragon sex chromosomes  <cit>  onto female metaphase chromosomes. scf <dig>  and scf <dig>  do not map to the sex chromosomes. scale bars indicate 10 μm



the sex chromosomes, therefore, consist of a small fragment homologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> and the rest is homologous to chicken chromosome  <dig>  it would seem that there has been a transposition of this small region of chicken  <dig> genes to the microchromosome homologous to chicken  <dig>  as rccd <dig> and oprd <dig> are surrounded by zinc finger protein genes, as well as containing a high proportion of repetitive sequences  <cit> , it is possible that this transposition is the result of an illegitimate recombination event.

although the four sex chromosome scaffolds account for a large proportion of chicken  <dig>  not all scaffolds containing chicken  <dig> genes map to dragon sex chromosomes, with scf <dig>  and scf <dig>  mapping to two different pairs of microchromosomes . there are a further four small scaffolds containing chicken chromosome  <dig> genes that are yet to be assigned to chromosomes. three of these scaffolds fall within a region orthologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> that is flanked by the two autosomal scaffolds, suggesting that this entire segment may be distributed on autosomes in dragon.

a comparison of gene arrangement on the dragon sex chromosome scaffolds and their orthologues in chicken indicates that a substantial number of rearrangements have occurred in this region . it is impossible at this stage to compare the gene arrangement of these scaffolds with that of anole as this region is spread over more than  <dig> scaffolds in the anole assembly, the majority of which have not been assigned to chromosomes.

our assignment of four genome scaffolds to the z chromosome has provided a list of over  <dig> genes whose role in sex determination can be assessed. one gene that stands out among this list is nr5a <dig>  because it has a known role in the sex determination and differentiation pathways in vertebrates. the expression of this gene has been noted to be highly changeable throughout vertebrate evolution, displaying expression patterns compatible with a role in testis development, ovarian development or a general role in gonadal development  <cit> . in humans, mutations in the nr5a <dig> gene have been discovered in xy sex reversed individuals  <cit>  and nr5a <dig> knockout mice have a sex reversed phenotype  <cit> . thus, nr5a <dig> is a strong candidate for being the sex determining gene in the dragon and warrants further investigation of its role in dragon sex determination.

CONCLUSIONS
tracing the evolutionary history of reptile genomes requires comparisons of genome organisation to be made, which can only be performed if genomic sequence is anchored to chromosomes. at present, this remains the limiting step in studies of comparative genome organisation. we have devised a strategy to greatly increase the amount of sequence assigned to chromosomes by creating super-scaffolds based on conserved synteny. anchoring of the dragon genome sequence to chromosomes has provided an important second anchored squamate genome assembly for comparative genomic studies. our comparative analysis permitted the reconstruction of chromosomal rearrangements, predominantly fusions, at key positions in squamate evolution. importantly, we have assigned sequence to all dragon chromosomes, including the sex chromosomes and identified nr5a <dig> as a candidate sex determining gene in dragon.
