BACKGROUND
the development of powerful new dna sequencing technologies has yielded new tools with the potential for dramatically revolutionizing scientific approaches to biological questions  <cit> . these new technologies can be used for a variety of applications, including genome sequencing, identification of dna-methylation sites, population studies, chromatin precipitation , and transcriptome studies . for rna-seq, cdna is generated from an mrna-enriched total rna preparation and sequenced using high-throughput technology. here, we used the illumina genome analyzer to characterize the transcriptome of stationary phase listeria monocytogenes 10403s and its isogenic Δsigb mutant, which lacks the general stress response sigma factor, σb.

l. monocytogenes, a gram-positive foodborne pathogen of the firmicutes family, is the etiological agent of the disease known as listeriosis. as 20% of listeriosis cases result in death in humans, with an estimated annual human death toll of ~  <dig> in the us alone  <cit> , this disease is a considerable public health concern. as a foodborne pathogen , this bacterium also presents challenging food safety concerns due to its ability to survive and grow under many conditions that are typically applied to control bacterial populations in foods, such as low ph, low temperature and high salt conditions  <cit> . the alternative general stress response sigma factor, σb, is an essential component of a regulatory mechanism that contributes to the ability of l. monocytogenes to respond to and survive exposure to harsh environmental conditions  <cit> .

sigma factors are dissociable subunits of prokaryotic rna polymerase responsible for enzyme recognition of a conserved dna sequence encoding a transcriptional promoter site. promoter recognition specificities of bacterial rna polymerase are determined by the transient association of an appropriate sigma factor with core polymerase in response to conditions affecting the cell  <cit> . the regulon of a single alternative sigma factor can include hundreds of transcriptional units, thus sigma factors provide an effective mechanism for simultaneously regulating large numbers of genes under appropriate conditions  <cit> . critical phenotypic functions regulated by alternative sigma factors range from bacterial sporulation  <cit>  to stress response systems  <cit> .

through microarray analyses, the σb regulon in l. monocytogenes has been reported to encompass more than  <dig> genes, including both virulence and stress response genes, many of them up-regulated upon entry into stationary phase  <cit> . however, interpretation of microarray analyses is dependent on the quality of existing genome annotations, which are rarely experimentally verified. further, transcripts that do not correspond to annotated features  cannot be identified. in addition, the utility of microarrays is limited by the genomic variation that exists among bacterial strains  and by technical biases such as cross-hybridization. hence, microarray data can be difficult to analyze and occasionally, misleading  <cit> . although interpretation of rna-seq data also relies on the availability of a genome sequence, it is probe- and annotation-independent and therefore, is free of cross-hybridization and low-hybridization biases, hence enabling genome-wide identification of all transcripts, including small noncoding rnas . moreover, because rna-seq technology can generate multiple reads corresponding to each transcribed nucleotide on the genome, it is usually possible to identify 5' and 3' transcript ends with high resolution  <cit> . therefore, in combination with bioinformatics tools, rna-seq data can be used to identify transcriptional promoters and terminators. we used l. monocytogenes as a model system to explore application of rna-seq for the dual purposes of genome-wide transcriptome characterization in a bacterial pathogen and comprehensive quantification of target gene expression for the alternative sigma factor, σb.

RESULTS
rna-seq provided comprehensive coverage of the l. monocytogenes transcriptome
rna-seq analyses were performed on two independent replicate rna samples collected from both the l. monocytogenes strain 10403s and an otherwise isogenic Δsigb mutant  that had been grown to stationary phase. cdna was generated from mrna-enriched total rna preparations from each strain and sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer to yield a total number of reads for each sample ranging from  <dig> , <dig> to  <dig> , <dig> . as the 10403s genome has not been completely closed, the sequence reads were aligned to a 10403s pseudochromosome that was created for this study using the completely closed genome of the l. monocytogenes strain egd-e  as a reference . the total number of reads matching regions other than rrna and trna ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , yielding between  <dig> × and  <dig>  × coverage of the pseudogenome. between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads in a given rna-seq run matched uniquely to the 10403s pseudochromosome and thus were used in subsequent analyses. reads that did not match the 10403s pseudochromosome  represented between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the reads sequenced; another  <dig> % to  <dig> % of the reads matched to at least two different locations on the pseudochromosome and, therefore, were removed before further analyses. reads identified as "matching two locations" did not include those matching rrna genes as the 10403s pseudochromosome created for this study was designed with only one unique rrna gene sequence.

athis indicates the factor that was used for normalization of replicates

to allow for quantitative comparisons among genes and runs, the coverage for each run was normalized for the total number of reads in each run and for gene size. the normalized data are presented as the gene expression index , which is expressed as the number of reads per  <dig> bases  <cit> . although in silico analyses suggested that the sequencibility  of the 10403s pseudochromosome was  <dig> % , approximately  <dig> % of the genome was covered by reads from at least one of the four runs, suggesting that more than 20% of the genome is not transcribed or is transcribed at low levels.

rna-seq coverage correlated with qrt-pcr transcript levels indicating that rna-seq data are quantitative
we evaluated whether average gei for specific genes correlated with transcript levels that had been measured using taqman qrt-pcr, the current gold standard for quantification of mrna  <cit> . based on transcript levels for  <dig> and  <dig> genes in 10403s and Δsigb, respectively, log transformed average gei and log transformed taqman qrt-pcr absolute copy numbers were correlated , supporting that rna-seq provides reliable quantitative estimates of transcript levels in l. monocytogenes. rna-seq was previously reported to provide quantitative data on transcript levels in yeast  <cit> , and more recently, in burkholderia cenocepacia  <cit> , thus, our findings extend this important correlation to a new prokaryotic system.

stationary phase l. monocytogenes transcribed at least 83% of annotated genes
among the  <dig> annotated coding sequences  in the 10403s pseudochromosome,  <dig>  showed an average gei ≥  <dig>  in 10403s  suggesting that at least 83% of the annotated l. monocytogenes genes are transcribed in stationary phase . of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  had high transcript levels,  <dig>  had medium transcript levels, and  <dig>  had low transcript levels. a total of  <dig> genes  had gei <  <dig>  and were considered "not transcribed". rna-seq data allowed visual examination of transcript units, aiding in identification of genes that are transcribed monocistronically or as part of an operon . a total of  <dig> transcription units appeared to represent operons; these units were identified and annotated . a total of  <dig>  of the annotated 10403s cds were located in these putative operons. further experimental data are necessary to validate our predictions of transcription unit structure as some genes may have rho-dependent terminators that were not identified in this study and, therefore, they may be transcribed monocistronically despite the observation of gei similar to those of their neighboring genes.

the three genes with the highest average gei in 10403s all encoded predicted ncrnas, including tmrna, 6s and lhra . the annotated cds  with the highest average gei were lmo <dig>  fri, and lmo <dig>  which encode a hypothetical cds, iron-binding ferritin, and an abc transporter, respectively. other genes with well defined functions and high average gei include flaa, which encodes a flagellin protein, sod, which encodes a superoxide dismutase involved in detoxification, and cspb and cspl, which encode cold-shock proteins involved in adaptation to atypical conditions .

both positive and negative associations were observed between gei and the tigr classification of sets of genes to physiological role categories http://cmr.jcvi.org/cgi-bin/cmr/roleids.cgi . for example, genes involved in protein synthesis and protein fate showed higher average gei in stationary phase 10403s as compared to genes involved in other functions, while genes involved in viral functions and amino acid biosynthesis were significantly associated with low average gei in 10403s. moreover, a positive significant association was observed between codon bias and the average gei in 10403s .

identification and annotation of noncoding rnas 
overall, we identified  <dig> ncrnas  that showed average gei ≥  <dig>  in 10403s, indicating that these ncrnas are transcribed in stationary phase l. monocytogenes . among the  <dig> ncrnas identified as transcribed in the present study,  <dig> matched ncrnas previously described in l. monocytogenes   <cit> . these  <dig> ncrnas included 6s rna, tmrna, several s-box rna and t-box leader rna molecules. a total of  <dig> putative ncrnas identified here were not previously identified in l. monocytogenes and did not match ncrna entries in rfam . the regions representing these putative ncrnas showed contiguous coverage by rna-seq reads , but did not fully match annotated genes. overall,  <dig> of the ncrnas recently identified by tiling microarray analyses in l. monocytogenes strain egd-e  <cit>  were not identified in this study . the most likely explanations for the absence of these egd-e ncrnas in 10403s are one or more of the following:  low  or no rna-seq coverage in 10403s ;  the homolog may be absent in the l. monocytogenes 10403s genome ;  ncrnas determined to be antisense rna in egd-e  <cit>  were not identified in 10403s, as the rna-seq protocol did not provide for directional reads;  the corresponding 10403s genome region has not been completely sequenced and closed , and  the egd-e ncrna did not meet our criterion of  <dig> bases of contiguous coverage.

three putative ncrnas with high gei covered either part or all of each of three annotated cds, suggesting that ncrnas overlap with these cds or that some putative cds actually encode ncrnas rather than proteins. specifically, lmrg_ <dig> , lmrg_ <dig> , and lmrg_ <dig>  overlapped with lhra , with the bacterial rnase p class b ncrna , and with the bacterial signal recognition particle rna , respectively. in concert with our findings, lmo <dig> was previously hypothesized not to be a cds  <cit> .

rna-seq identified  <dig> annotated cds and one ncrna as σb-dependent and provided comprehensive data on transcript levels for genes in the σb regulon
our rna-seq data analyses identified a total of  <dig> genes as up-regulated by σb . no annotated genes were identified as significantly down-regulated by σb in this study. although various genes have been identified previously as down-regulated by σb  <cit> , we have observed that genes with significantly higher transcript levels in the Δsigb strain :  are likely to be indirectly regulated by σb, as σb is a transcriptional activator,  generally show a lower fold-difference in transcript levels between the parent strain and the Δsigb strain as compared to genes identified as up-regulated by σb  <cit> , and  have not been consistently identified as down-regulated by σb between different studies, even in microarray studies using the same strain and condition . down-regulation of genes by σb thus appears stochastic as compared to up-regulation by σb. overall, our findings suggest that rna-seq combined with stringent criteria for detection of statistically significant differences in transcript levels  may generate fewer false positives as compared to some microarray-based approaches.

as illustrated in figure 4a, rna-seq data are useful for predicting multi-gene operons controlled by a given regulator such as σb. thirty-eight of the  <dig> genes up-regulated by σb are organized into a total of  <dig> operons, including  opucabcd, which encodes the subunits of a glycine betaine/carnitine/choline abc transporter,  lmo0781-lmo <dig>  which encode the four subunits of a putative mannose-specific phosphotransferase system,  lmo2484-lmo <dig>  which encode a putative membrane-associated protein and a putative transcriptional regulator similar to pspc, respectively, and  lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> , which encode proteins similar to e. coli yjdi and yjdj, respectively.

one-sided fisher's exact tests were used to determine if σb-dependent genes are over-represented within specific tigr role categories. genes identified as σb-dependent were over-represented among genes involved in cellular functions . σb-dependent genes in this category include genes involved in pathogenesis , adaptation to atypical conditions , detoxification , cell division  and an unknown protein that may be involved in toxin production and resistance .

we evaluated rna-seq transcript levels for the  <dig> σb-dependent genes identified here . the average fold change  for the  <dig> σb-dependent genes ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the σb-dependent genes with the highest average gei in 10403s were lmo <dig>  lmo <dig>  and lmo <dig>  which encode a protein similar to b. subtilis ywmg, an unknown protein, and a tagatose- <dig> -diphosphate aldolase, respectively .

an ~  <dig> nt σb-dependent ncrna was identified between lmo <dig> and lmo <dig> ; this ncrna was recently designated rli <dig>  <cit> . to be consistent with the nomenclature for other σb-dependent ncrna  <cit> , we propose that rli <dig> be named sbre . although blastx searches  and searches against the pfam database did not yield significant matches, a σb-dependent promoter was identified upstream of the transcript and a rho-independent terminator was found by transtermhp . the sequence for this putative ncrna was also present in  <dig> other l. monocytogenes genomes, including egd-e , f <dig> , and  <dig> unfinished genome sequences by the broad institute http://www.broad.mit.edu/annotation/genome/listeria_group/multihome.html as well as in one l. innocua  and one l. welshimeri  genome. the  <dig> nt sbre  sequence was  <dig> % conserved among the  <dig> l. monocytogenes genomes.

hmm showed that 84% of σb-dependent genes and operons identified by rna-seq are preceded by σb promoters and therefore, appear to be directly regulated by σb
an hmm representing l. monocytogenes σb-dependent promoters was dynamically created by using an initial training set of experimentally verified l. monocytogenes σb-dependent promoters to search the rna-seq data. the final model yielded a total of  <dig>  motifs with scores >  <dig>  bits throughout the pseudochromosome sequence. among these motifs, we identified  <dig> possible σb-dependent promoter sequences upstream of genes and operons identified as σb-dependent based on rna-seq data . because some of the genes with experimentally validated σb promoters were not found to be significantly up-regulated by σb in our study  and because the ltrc promoter, which was in the initial training set, had a score below our threshold of  <dig>  bits in the final search, our annotation does not include all promoters present in the training set . specifically, σb-dependent promoter sequences were found upstream of  <dig> of the  <dig> putative σb-dependent operons,  <dig> of the  <dig> monocistronic σb-dependent genes, and the one σb-dependent ncrna identified here . we compared rna-seq defined transcriptional start sites for  <dig> genes with σb promoters to transcriptional start sites determined by rapid amplification of cdna ends pcr  in a previous study  <cit> . transcriptional start sites identified with rna-seq were located between  <dig> to  <dig> bases down-stream  of start sites determined by race-pcr , indicating that rna-seq successfully approximates transcriptional start sites, but sometimes does not provide full sequence coverage to the 5' end of a transcript. some transcriptional start sites could not be specifically mapped to a σb promoter site using rna-seq as some genes  have multiple promoters. a dendrogram of the putative σb promoter sequences showed no apparent clustering of these promoter sequences by either average gei in 10403s or by σb-dependence . these results suggest that additional regulatory elements or mechanisms other than promoter sequence per se  also influence transcript levels and/or σb-dependence for these genes .

rna-seq successfully identifies a number of previously identified as well as novel σb-dependent genes
to evaluate the ability of rna-seq to identify l. monocytogenes σb-dependent genes, we compared the σb-dependent genes identified here with those identified in two independent microarray studies by our research group. specifically, we compared our results with microarray data reported by  raengpradub et al.  <cit> , who identified σb-dependent genes using l. monocytogenes strains and growth conditions identical to those in this study, and by  ollinger et al.  <cit> , who identified σb-dependent genes by comparing transcripts from l. monocytogenes 10403s with a prfa*  allele  <cit> , which constitutively expresses the prfa-regulated virulence genes  <cit> , with those from an isogenic Δsigb mutant grown to stationary phase under the same conditions used here. further, we compared our results with those from a microarray study using another l. monocytogenes strain  and its isogenic Δsigb mutant, grown under similar conditions . among the  <dig> σb-dependent annotated cds identified in the present study,  <dig> were also identified as σb-dependent in previous microarray studies of stationary phase l. monocytogenes 10403s cells  <cit>  . in addition,  <dig>  of the  <dig> σb-dependent genes identified here were identified as positively regulated by σb in l. monocytogenes strain egd-e cells grown to early stationary phase   <cit> . overall,  <dig> genes identified as σb-dependent in stationary phase cells in both previous microarray studies by our group  <cit> , were not identified as σb-dependent by the rna-seq experiments reported here ;  <dig> of these genes showed a σb-dependent promoter based on the hmm analyses in this study and are likely to be directly regulated by σb .

finally, a total of  <dig> annotated cds identified as σb-dependent by rna-seq  had not been identified as σb-dependent in either of the previous microarray studies with strain 10403s grown to stationary phase  <cit>  . among these  <dig> genes not previously identified as σb-dependent in stationary phase l. monocytogenes 10403s, five had previously been identified as σb-dependent in salt-stressed cells  <cit> , including the well-characterized virulence genes inla and inlb, which have also been shown by qrt-pcr and promoter mapping to be directly regulated by σb  <cit> . in addition, two of these  <dig> genes had been identified as positively regulated by σb in l. monocytogenes strain egd-e  <cit> , even though they had not been identified as σb-dependent in previous microarray studies of strain 10403s  <cit> . for one of these genes , the microarray probe  showed a low hybridization index  to 10403s . interestingly, lmo <dig>  which encodes a transcription regulator similar to the gntr family, was identified as σb-dependent by rna-seq, but had not been previously identified as σb-dependent in either 10403s or egd-e.

discussion
in this study, we used deep rna sequencing to define and characterize the transcriptomes of l. monocytogenes strain 10403s and an otherwise isogenic Δsigb mutant, which does not express the general stress-response sigma factor, σb. the data generated using this approach showed that  at least 83% of annotated l. monocytogenes genes are transcribed in stationary phase cells; and  stationary phase l. monocytogenes transcribes  <dig> ncrnas, including one σb-dependent ncrna and seven ncrnas that, to our knowledge, have not previously been identified in l. monocytogenes. additionally, rna-seq data provided for quantitation of transcript levels and approximate identification of transcriptional start sites on a genome scale. use of a novel, iterative, dynamic hmm, in combination with rna-seq data, identified putative σb-dependent promoters and further defined the l. monocytogenes σb regulon.

the majority of annotated l. monocytogenes genes are transcribed in stationary phase cells
while genome sequencing and microarray approaches have provided important insight into the biology of prokaryotic organisms, including a number of human bacterial pathogens, identification of all genes and their transcriptional patterns remains a major challenge in all areas of biology. our results demonstrate that global probe-independent approaches for transcriptome characterization are valuable tools for analyzing bacterial transcriptomes  <cit> . a major challenge that currently hinders analysis of transcriptomic data generated by approaches such as rna-seq is the ability to differentiate between genes with low levels of transcription and background levels of coverage. several approaches have been used to define cut-off values between background gei and gei indicative of low transcript levels . we chose a comparative analysis of l. monocytogenes 10403s transcript levels with those of a mutant strain that does not express a transcription factor  as a novel approach for robustly defining background rna-seq coverage. our results show that a number of σb-dependent genes were solely σb-dependent , as supported by the lack of detectable rna-seq coverage in the Δsigb strain, despite considerable rna-seq coverage of the same genes in the isogenic parent strain 10403s. this is an important observation as a number of σb-dependent l. monocytogenes genes are also activated by other sigma factors . using the average gei for l. monocytogenes genes that were solely σb-dependent in the Δsigb strain as a conservative cut-off value for transcribed genes, we found that approximately 83% of l. monocytogenes 10403s annotated cds were transcribed in stationary phase cells. these transcribed genes include  <dig> putative operons, which cover a total of  <dig>  genes, indicating that a considerable proportion of l. monocytogenes genes appear to be transcribed polycistronically. in comparison, a recent study using a tiling microarray identified  <dig> polycistronic operons that encompass  <dig>  genes in l. monocytogenes egd-e  <cit> . taken together, these data indicate that the majority of annotated l. monocytogenes genes are transcribed. this conclusion is consistent with results from a whole-genome tiled microarray transcriptome study of e. coli mg <dig>  <cit> , which reported transcription of  <dig> e. coli mg <dig> genes in bacteria grown under different conditions, suggesting that about 98% of the e. coli mg <dig> genes are transcribed.

our results also demonstrate that rna-seq coverage levels  correlate well with quantitative rt-pcr-based mrna transcript level data. therefore, in combination with results from previous studies , our findings indicate that rna-seq tools can be broadly applied in biological studies to enable quantitative analysis of transcript levels. we also found a positive correlation between rna-seq-based transcript levels and codon bias, consistent with the well-documented observation that genes with high codon bias are often highly expressed  <cit> . genes in four role categories, including  signal transduction,  viral functions,  amino acid biosynthesis, and  transport and binding, were significantly associated with lower transcript levels. these categories include a number of genes that encode proteins predominantly required for growth and survival under specialized environmental conditions  or under conditions other than stationary phase , and/or proteins that may only be required in small amounts. on the other hand, we found that genes in seven role categories, including  cellular processes,  dna metabolism,  protein fate,  protein synthesis,  purines, pyrimidines, nucleosides, and nucleotides,  transcription, and  genes encoding proteins with unknown functions, showed, on average, higher transcript levels in stationary phase l. monocytogenes. these findings suggest that genes in these particular categories are important for bacterial cells transitioning from exponential growth to stationary phase.

overall, the l. monocytogenes genes with the highest transcript levels were ncrnas, specifically the transfer-messenger rna  and 6s rna, consistent with the observation that tmrnas are involved with bacterial recovery from a variety of stresses including entry into stationary phase, amino acid starvation, and heat shock  <cit> . 6s rna accumulates in cells during stationary phase; cells lacking 6s rna have reduced fitness relative to wildtype stationary phase cells  <cit> . in addition to down-regulating some housekeeping genes, 6s rna has been shown to up-regulate expression of some σs-dependent genes in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . σs is the stationary phase stress response alternative sigma factor in e. coli  <cit> . taken together, we hypothesize that 6s rna plays a critical role in the ability of l. monocytogenes to survive stationary phase associated stress conditions.

specific protein-encoding genes with very high transcript levels in stationary phase l. monocytogenes include fri, sod, cspb, and cspl, all genes with some previous evidence for contributions to l. monocytogenes stationary phase and stress survival  <cit> . flaa, which encodes a flagellin protein, was also highly transcribed in stationary phase cells at 37°c. although l. monocytogenes has been reported to show flagellar motility only when grown at ≤ 30°c  <cit> , our results are consistent with the observation that strain 10403s, which was used in this study, has been shown to express flagellin at 37°c  <cit> . interestingly, we also found some annotated cds without known function to be highly transcribed, including lmo <dig> and lmo <dig>  which encode putative abc transporters based on blast and pfam  <cit>  searches, respectively, and lmo <dig>  which encodes an unknown protein.

rna-seq identifies ncrna molecules in l. monocytogenes, including a σb-dependent ncrna, in 10403s
using rna-seq, we found  <dig> previously identified or putative ncrnas that were transcribed in stationary phase l. monocytogenes. of these,  <dig> represent ncrnas that have not been identified previously as transcribed in l. monocytogenes. sixty of the ncrnas identified here have previously been reported by toledo-arana et al.  <cit> , nielsen et al.  <cit> , mandin et al.  <cit>  and christiansen et al.  <cit> . interestingly,  <dig> l. monocytogenes ncrnas with similarities to ncrnas identified in other bacterial organisms are putative riboswitches. we also found that sbre , which has no homologies to ncrna entries in rfam, appears to be directly regulated by σb, based on the considerably higher transcript levels  present in the parent strain as compared to the sigb-null mutant, consistent with results from a recent tiling microarray study  <cit> . as the rna isolation procedure used here selected against small rna molecules , it is likely that additional small ncrnas not detected here , are also transcribed in stationary phase l. monocytogenes 10403s.

prior to this study, l. monocytogenes ncrnas, including potential σb-dependent ncrnas  <cit> , had been identified using in silico modeling  <cit> , co-precipitation with the rna-binding protein hfq  <cit> , and, most recently, tiling microarrays  <cit> . while, among these approaches, tiling microarrays  <cit>  provided the most comprehensive characterization of l. monocytogenes ncrnas, deep rna sequencing also identified a large number of transcribed l. monocytogenes ncrnas, including ncrnas with no similarities to previously identified ncrnas. our results, taken together with previous studies that have identified numerous novel transcripts with rna-seq in bacteria , yeast  <cit> , mouse  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit> , human cell lines  <cit> , and human tissue  <cit> , clearly show the power of this technique for characterizing bacterial transcriptomes and ncrnas.

the l. monocytogenes σb regulon is composed of at least  <dig> genes, including  <dig> genes and  <dig> ncrna that are preceded by putative σb promoters
as alternative sigma factors, such as σb, are known to play critical roles in gene regulation across bacterial genera  <cit> , we used l. monocytogenes 10403s and an isogenic Δsigb null mutant as a model system for exploring the use of rna-seq, in combination with in silico analyses, for characterization of transcriptional blueprints associated with bacterial regulatory elements. in our study, rna-seq identified  <dig> annotated cds and one ncrna sbre  that are up-regulated by σb. quantitative rt-pcr experiments also confirmed σb-dependent transcript levels of sbre  . among the  <dig> σb-dependent annotated cds identified in this study,  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  were also identified as σb-dependent in stationary phase cells in two previous microarray studies using the same strain background. also,  <dig> of the  <dig> σb-dependent genes identified here were reported as positively regulated by σb in another l. monocytogenes strain  grown to early stationary phase  <cit> . twelve genes were identified as σb-dependent in both previous microarray studies performed with the same l. monocytogenes strain background and the same conditions used here, but were not identified as σb-dependent by rna-seq in this study. this disparity is likely due to the fact that the thresholds and statistical cut-offs used to define σb-dependent genes were very stringent in the present study .

overall, in addition to confirming a previously identified σb-dependent ncrna  <cit> , rna-seq identified  <dig> genes that had not been defined as σb-dependent in previous microarray studies of stationary phase l. monocytogenes 10403s cells  <cit> , including  <dig> genes that had been identified as σb-dependent in salt stressed cells, but not in stationary phase cells. one gene not previously identified as σb-dependent was lmo <dig>  which encodes a transcription regulator similar to the gntr family. the gntr family of regulators has been characterized as global regulators of primary metabolism in a number of bacteria  <cit> . this finding further supports that l. monocytogenes σb appears to be involved in a number of transcriptional regulatory networks  <cit> . increasing evidence indicates that regulatory rnas also contribute to regulatory networks that involve l. monocytogenes σb. for example, in addition to the σb-dependent sbre ncrna described here, tiling array analyses also identified additional σb-dependent ncrnas. while previous in silico studies in l. monocytogenes strain egd-e  <cit>  identified four putative σb-dependent ncrnas , only sbra was confirmed in vivo as σb-dependent in egd-e  <cit> . even though our rna-seq analyses in 10403s identified sbra transcripts, transcript levels for this ncrna were not σb-dependent under the conditions used in our study. the fact that sbra was not found to be σb-dependent in 10403s may be due to differences in strains or growth conditions used . further studies in different l. monocytogenes strains will thus be needed to understand the full complexity of regulatory networks in this pathogen, including those involving σb and ncrnas.

the quantitative nature of rna-seq allowed us to also identify highly transcribed σb-dependent genes, including lmo <dig> , lmo <dig> , and lmo <dig> . interestingly, none of these genes encode proteins that appear to contribute to any of the presently recognized σb-dependent phenotypes in l. monocytogenes, such as acid resistance  <cit> , oxidative stress resistance  <cit> , or virulence  <cit> . as there are no published reports of construction and characterization of null mutations in these highly transcribed σb-dependent genes, our data clearly suggest that σb and the σb regulon make additional important contributions to l. monocytogenes physiology that remain to be characterized.

in conjunction with appropriate bioinformatics tools, such as the iterative, dynamic hmm developed in this study to identify putative σb promoters, rna-seq data also allowed mapping of approximate transcriptional start and termination sites. specifically, putative σb-dependent promoters were identified upstream of   <dig> monocistronic σb-dependent genes,   <dig> σb-dependent operons , and   <dig> σb-dependent ncrna. by comparison, in the absence of genome wide transcriptional start site data, a previous study that solely relied on hmm and genome sequence data identified putative σb-dependent promoters upstream of only  <dig> genes that had been identified as σb-dependent by microarray analyses  <cit> . our data reported here show that the majority of σb-dependent genes are directly regulated by σb and illustrate the power of combining rna-seq data and bioinformatics approaches for characterizing transcriptional regulatory systems. specifically, combining transcriptional start site information with an hmm that identifies promoter motifs  provides a powerful approach for identifying genes directly regulated by a given transcription factor. this approach facilitates rapid genome-wide identification of putative transcriptional start sites, which currently represents a critical bottleneck in genome-wide characterization of transcriptional regulation and regulatory networks, as many current strategies for promoter mapping , rnase protection assays) are time- and labor-intensive.

CONCLUSIONS
using the human foodborne pathogen l. monocytogenes as a model system, we have shown that rna-seq provides a powerful approach to  rapidly, comprehensively, and quantitatively characterize prokaryotic genome-wide transcription profiles without hybridization bias, and  characterize putative transcriptional start sites and operon structures. we also show that rna-seq transcriptomic evaluation of a bacterial strain bearing a deletion in a transcriptional regulator in comparison with its parent strain can provide rapid, comprehensive insights into the blueprints of prokaryotic transcriptional regulation. such tools and approaches will revolutionize our ability to characterize genome-wide transcriptional regulatory networks, with wide ranging applications from medicine to ecology, e.g., by providing a means to quickly characterize transcriptional networks contributing to pathogen transmission and virulence as well as environmental growth and gene expression in bacteria used for specific purposes, such as bio-remediation. when applied to both genome and transcriptome sequencing, novel high throughput sequencing approaches can also provide rapid and comprehensive characterization of bacterial genomes, representing an important tool for initial rapid characterization of novel and emerging bacterial pathogens.
