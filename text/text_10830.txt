BACKGROUND
molecular sequence analysis has become the method of choice to address phylogenetic questions. the applied techniques improve continually and the rapidly growing amount of available data helps to broaden our knowledge of phylogenetic relationships within the animal kingdom. nevertheless, different molecular datasets often show conflicting phylogenetic signals, so that results relying on just one dataset may be interpreted with caution  <cit> . unlike nuclear dna, the mt-genome of animals is normally rather small and simply structured: haploid, without or only few non-coding segments, repetitive regions and transposable elements. derived from endosymbiotic bacteria only a few genes are retained in the mitochondrial genomes of bilateria:  <dig> protein subunits ,  <dig> ribosomal rnas  and  <dig> trnas are found encoded on a circular doublestranded dna molecule sized about  <dig> kb  <cit> . as such sequencing and annotation of mt-genomes is much easier and faster than analysing nuclear genomes, making mt-genomes one of the commonly used sources of sequence data for phylogenetic analyses. apart from sequence data other features of the genome may contain phylogenetic information, too. taxon-specific gene order often remains identical over long periods of time  <cit> . simultaneously, the intra-taxonomic variances of these characteristic orders are quite distinctive and convergent changes in the positioning of single genes are rather unlikely, due to the vast number of possible combinations  <cit> . thus changes in the mitochondrial gene order have proved to be valuable tools in phylogenetic analyses  <cit> . less often secondary structures of trnas or rrnas show distinct differences between taxa  and hence may also contribute to a phylogenetic analysis  <cit> .

the taxon sipuncula  comprises about  <dig> species, being found in all water depths of different marine habitats. the hemisessile organisms dwell in mud and sand, but settle also in empty mollusc shells or coral reef clefts for instance. their body shows no segmentation, but a subdivision into a posterior trunk and an anterior introvert that can be fully retracted into the trunk is observeable  <cit> . fossils that date back into the later cambrian  <cit>  suggest that sipunculans have undergone little morphologically change over the past  <dig> myr. the monophyly of this morphologically uniform taxon is well founded by morphological  <cit>  and molecular data  <cit> . however, the phylogenetic position within bilateria was highly disputed. based on morphological characters, very different phylogenetic positions of sipuncula were discussed. early in history an affinity to echinodermata, especially holothurians was mentioned and later again propagated by nichols  <cit> , but with little acceptance from other authors. scheltema  <cit>  proposed a close relationship to molluscs based on the presence of the so calles "molluscan cross" organization of micromeres during spiral cleavage. the usefulness of this character for phylogenetic inference was neglected by malaskova  <cit> . other analyses found sipuncula to be sister group of mollusca, annelida and arthropoda  <cit> , articulata   <cit> , echiura  <cit> , mollusca  <cit> , annelida  <cit>  or annelida+echiura  <cit> . more details about the different hypotheses of sipunculid relationships are reviewed in  <cit> .

in contrast to all these studies, molecular analyses of large datasets from 18s/28s data  <cit> , ests  <cit>  or mitochondrial genome data  <cit>  favour an inclusion of sipuncula into annelids. an implication of this hypothesis is that we have to assume that segmentation has been reduced within sipuncula  <cit> . a derivation from segmented ancestors of sipuncula was recently also supported by a segmental mode of neural patterning in ontogeny  <cit> .

relationhips within sipuncula are well investigated  <cit> . an analysis using combined molecular and morphological data recovered five major clades and supports that sipunculus is the sister group to all other sipunculids  <cit> .

up to now mt-genome data from sipuncula was restricted to a partial mtdna sequence from phascolosoma gouldii  <cit> , comprising only about half of the complete genome. here we describe the first complete mitochondrial genome for another representative of the sipuncula, sipunculus nudus. we analyse sequence data in comparison with mitochondrial genomes of various bilateria to evaluate the phylogenetic position of sipuncula. in addition we compare gene order among lophotrochozoa and evaluate the most parsimonious explanation for gene order changes.

RESULTS
genome organisation
the complete mt-genome of s. nudus is a circular dna doublestrand of  <dig> bp length. as usual in bilateria,  <dig> genes coding for different protein subunits and two encoding ribosomal rna genes were identified. in addition  <dig> trna genes were detected and thus all  <dig> genes typically present in bilaterian mt genomes, were found . all of these genes are located on the -strand, as is the case in annelid and echiurid mt-genomes. there are two small gene overlaps: one between nad4l and nad <dig> , the other one between trns  and nad <dig> . the putative control region is  <dig> bp in length and flanked by trnf and trnt. besides the control region  <dig> other non-coding regions are dispersed over the whole genome, ranging from one to  <dig> base pairs. the three largest of these are located between trny and trne , trnh and nad <dig>  and nad <dig> and trns  .

* start and stop position of ribosomal rna and ncr according to adjacent gene boundaries

the gc-skew  reflects the relative number of cytosin to guanine and is often used to describe the strand-specific bias of the nucleotide composition  <cit> . in s.nudus the complete -strand genome sequence has a clear bias toward cytosine . as all genes are coded on -strand, all single gene sequences exhibit a negative gc-skew, too , ranging from - <dig>   to - <dig>  . a negative gc-skew is also found in most of the mitochondrial genomes known from annelids, pogonophorans, and myzostomids, with the exception of the annelid eclysippe vanelli  <cit> . at-skew of the complete -strand is close to evenness  and single gene at-skews are distributed around evenness with a range between  <dig>   and - <dig>  , see also table  <dig>  at content of the complete genome is  <dig> %, at contents of protein-coding and rrna genes are not much derived from this value, between a minimum of  <dig> %  and a maximum of  <dig> % .

protein coding genes
all but one of the protein subunits begin with start codon atg, only nad <dig> starts with ata. both are prevalent in mitochondrial genomes. the commonly found stop codons taa and tag are present, as well as the abbreviated forms ta  and t . putative shortened stop codons were already found in other species and are thought to be complemented via post-transcriptional polyadenylation  <cit> .

ribosomal rna genes and control region
the sizes of the ribosomal rnas  are within the range of their sizes in other animals including molluscs and annelids. the two genes only separated by trnv, a feature often found in animals from vertebrates to arthropods, so therefore this represent an ancestral condition. among annelids and their kin only echiurans  and myzostomids  differ from that condition in that there is no trna gene separating the two ribosomal genes. at content of ribosomal genes is  <dig> %  and  <dig> % , so well within the range of at content of protein-coding genes.

noncoding regions, putative control region
the putative control region is found between nad3/trnf on one side and trnt/nad4l/nad <dig> on the other side. while gene order  in annelida is more or less conserved there is a great variation in the position of the control region:  species from clitellata, maldanidae and terebellidae have a major non-coding region between atp6/trnr and trnh/nad5;  in orbinia it is located between nad4/trnc/trnl <dig> and trnl1/trnm/rrns;  in platynereis it is found between cox2/trng and trnv/atp <dig>  <cit> . such great variability is not found in other taxa like arthropoda or vertebrata, where also the control region is found in the same position in different species, when gene order of the rest of the mt-genome is conserved.

in sipunculus nudus the major non-coding region has a size of  <dig> bp and is clearly more at rich  than the rest of the genome . structural elements know from arthropod mitochondrial control regions  <cit>  are present also in s. nudus:  a poly-ta stretch of  <dig> bp including a tenfold ta repeat;  a poly-t stretch flanked by purin bases;  a ga-rich block of  <dig> bases length. although we examined the complete non-coding region intensively by software and by eye, no large stem-loop structure was identified. such a structure is normally found between the poly-t stretch and the ga rich region in arthropods.

transfer rnas
all typical  <dig> trnas were detected in the mitochondrial genome of s. nudus, their putative secondary structures are depicted in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  all but three trna genes are capable to be folded in the usual cloverleaf structure, consisting of tψc stem and loop, anticodon stem and loop, dhu stem and loop, and the acceptor stem – trna-ser and trna-ser have no dhu stem. while trna-ser shows this feature in many bilaterian mt-genomes, the other one must have changed its secondary structure in the lineage leading to sipuncula and after the split of its sister group. the putative secondary structure of trna-cys shows no tψc, in addition there are two mismatches in the anticodon stem and an unusual anticodon , weakening this secondary structure hypothesis. but intensive search for an alternative sequence of trna-cys was not successful, so we stuck with this hypothesis although we cannot rule out that this is a non-functional sequence or subject to gene editing. in several other trnas there are mismatches in the acceptor or anticodon stem.

mitochondrial gene order
fig.  <dig> shows a comparison of lophotrochozoan mitochondrial gene orders and the ground pattern of bilateria . we restrict the discussion of gene order to the protein-coding and rrna genes, as trna genes change their relative position much faster than the former, as seen in gene order comparisons of e.g. annelids  <cit>  or crustaceans  <cit> . the annelids, pogonophorans and myzostomids do not differ from each other in the relative positions of protein-coding and rrna genes. compared to the ground pattern of bilateria several genes have a different relative position:  nad6/cob are found right after cox <dig>   atp <dig> is found between cob and nad <dig>   nad <dig> and nad4l/nad <dig> have interchanged positions, and  nad <dig> is found between nad <dig> and nad <dig> . mollusca  and brachiopoda  show a different pattern, with derived positions for three gene blocks: rrns/rrnl/nad <dig>  cox3/nad <dig> and nad6/cob. the translocation of nad6/cob may be explained as a commonly derived feature of lophotrochozoa, or a subtaxon of it including mollusca, phoronida, brachiopoda, nemertea, annelida s. l.  and sipuncula . the other translocation events found in annelids and their kin  seem to be restricted to that group. the gene order so far known from nemertea  can be easily derived with one change  from the pattern of the brachiopod terebratulina and the gene order of phoronida  from that of the mollusc katharina tunicata with only one event . much more variation is seen within mollusca  <cit>  and brachiopoda  <cit>  .

compared to the annelida and their kin, the mitochondrial gene order of sipunculus nudus differs clearly:  atp <dig> and nad <dig> are found between nad <dig> and nad <dig>  this may be interpreted as two events restricted to the sipunculid lineage and independently achieved from the bilaterian or lophotrochozoan ground pattern. but another explanation would be a singular event translocating the block atp6/nad <dig> compared to the annelid ground pattern ;  rrns/rrnl found a different position, between cob and nad <dig> – this is as well different from the situation in brachiopoda and mollusca, so probably another event in the lineage leading to sipuncula ;  nad <dig> is found right after rrnl and adjacent to nad4l/nad <dig>  this is different from its position in annelids, pogonophorans, myzostomids and echiuran taxa and is more similar to the bilaterian ground pattern. visualized in fig.  <dig> the most parsimonious explanation of sipunculid gene order is that sipuncula share two events with annelids, but lack the translocation of nad <dig>  in addition two events have to be assumed in the lineage of sipunula . derivation of the sipunculus gene order directly from the bilaterian ground pattern would demand four translocation events  from which only one is shared with other lophotrochozoan taxa . so this hypothesis is in demand of three additional events instead of two for the "annelid" hypothesis. derivation of the sipunculid gene order from the brachiopod/mollusc pattern is in demand of five additional events. therefore the most parsimonious explanation of gene order changes would be that sipuncula is sister group to a group comprising annelida s.str., myzostomida, echiura and pogonophora.

at first sight gene order of the echiurid urechis caupo  <cit>  is completely different from that of annelids and sipunculus, but the position of atp <dig> between cob and nad <dig> and that of nad <dig> adjacent to nad <dig> clearly hint to the derived features postulated for the annelid ground pattern . as well adjacency of nad <dig> to cox <dig> is found in all annelids and sipunuculus. so the gene order of urechis may be derived from the annelid ground pattern, with additional translocations of three genome segments:  cox1/cox2/atp <dig>   rrns/rrnl and  nad <dig> 

phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial sequences
the phylogenetic analysis was performed with a concatenated amino acid alignment of  <dig> protein-coding genes  from  <dig> species. fig.  <dig> shows the best tree of the maximum likelihood analysis with raxml . a close relationship of sipunculus and phascolopsis and thus monophyletic sipuncula is well supported . sipuncula appears to be close related to the classic "annelida", echiura and pogonophora – this assemblage has a bootstrap support of 93%. this assemblage is also other recovered in recent molecular analyses of 18s/28s rrna and ef1α  <cit>  or est data  <cit> . the internal relationships of these taxa are not well resolved by our analysis. with high bootstrap support clitellata  and pogonophora  appear monophyletic, while their sister group relationship found only weak support . sister group to the sipuncula/annelida/echiura/pogonophora taxon is myzostomida , this relationship is also supported by morphological characters and mitochondrial gene order as recently detailed elsewhere  <cit> . the position of this "annelida sensu lato" among other lophotrochozan subtaxa is not well resolved in our analysis.

probably due to long branch effects, ecdysozoa and lophotrochoza appear not to be monophyletic in our analysis. while the former miss nematoda, the latter miss platyhelminthes, ectoprocta, rotifera, acanthocephala and some molluscs. all these taxa are associated with long branches and form a probably artificial clade, which was never recovered in analyses with molecular data from nuclear genes or morphological data. apart from this the most "problematic" taxon are mollusca, with some taxa  found clustering with the above mentioned nematode-platyhelminth assemblage, others  clustering with nemertea, phoronida and entoprocta, while lampsilis appears as sister taxon to brachiopoda.

for further evaluation the interrelationships of annelida sensu lato, we performed additional phylogenetic analyses with a smaller taxon set comprising  <dig> species . ml analyses were done comparing mtrev  and mtart  models; in addition a bayesian analysis was performed with mtrev model . myzostomida, sipuncula and other annelida formed a monophyletic group  supported by ml bootstrapping , but not by bi, where support is below  <dig>  . sipuncula and annelida together form a clade well supported by all three analyses, while annelida without sipuncula found best support only in bi, while the ml analyses do not significantly support this group, leaving open if there is a basal split between sipuncula and the rest of the annelids. in the best ml-mtart tree platynereis is found as sister to sipuncula tree, but with bootstrap support below 50%. well supported subtaxa of annelids are pogonophora , clitellata, pogonophora+clitellata, orbiniidae . topologies obtained in the three analyses differ in the position of urechis , which is found as sister to maldanidae+terebelliformia in the best ml tree with mtrev model , as sister to orbiniidae in the best tree with mtart model  and as sister to pogonophora+clitellata in bi .

in addition we performed an au test as implemented in consel to statistically test the hypothesis of a sister group relationship between sipuncula and mollusca. we were able to significantly reject  this hypothesis compared to the best ml-tree .

CONCLUSIONS
annelida, in traditional phylogenetic systems the sister group to arthropoda, are nowadays included in the taxon lophotrochozoa by almost all large scale analyses  <cit> . in this view more and more molecular studies no longer support the monophyly of the classical annelida . as well as the unsegmented pogonophora, echiura, and myzostomida the sipuncula have also been under suspect to be included in what was called annelida sensu lato  <cit> . the complete mitochondrial genomic sequence of sipunculus nudus presented in this paper, adds an important piece of evidence to answer the question of sipunculid position in the metazoan tree of life. our sequence data and gene order analysis clearly support an affinity of sipuncula to annelida s. l.  rather than to mollusca or any other phylum. it still remains an open question if sipuncula and the whole annelida s. l. are sister groups , or if myzostomids form the sister group to sipuncula and the remaining annelida . in sequence-based analyses the myzostomid is the annelid taxon with the longest branch, suggesting a more rapid evolution of mitochondrial sequence in this taxon. therefore analyses placing myzostomids outside the annelida are probably misleading due to higher substitution rates in myzostomids.
