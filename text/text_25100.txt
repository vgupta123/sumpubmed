BACKGROUND
adipose tissues play crucial roles in the development of obesity, with white adipose tissue  functioning as an energy storage organ and brown adipose tissue  functioning as an energy consumption organ  <cit> . bat is especially abundant throughout the life-span of rodents and in hibernating mammals. in humans it was believed to present only in newborns and disappears in adults  <cit> . interestingly, bat and its increased activities in response to low temperature  can be detected in adult humans by 18f-fluorodeoxyglucose  positron-emission tomography-computed tomography , and the response negatively correlates with their increasing body mass index  <cit> . although wat and bat both express a set of genes that are involved in the regulation of lipolysis, fatty acid metabolism, triacylglycerol  storage and insulin sensitivity  <cit> , bat contains a large number of mitochondria and is functionally more important as a thermogenic tissue  <cit> . uncoupling protein  <dig> , which is uniquely expressed in bat, plays an important role in the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation and the conversion of energy into heat to maintain normal body temperature. in addition to ucp <dig>  type  <dig> iodothyronine deiondinase   <cit> , elongation of very long chain fatty acid- <dig>   <cit> , cox8b  <cit>  and lipid storage droplet protein  <dig>   <cit>  are also expressed at high levels in bat but low levels in wat. pgc-1α  <cit> , a co-activator that coordinates multiple physiological cues for mitochondrial biogenesis and activity, is highly expressed in bat but only expressed at low levels in wat  <cit> . tr <dig>  a member of the nuclear receptor super-family, is expressed in brown adipocytes upon cold exposure and inhibits adipocyte differentiation  <cit> . in contrast, mesoderm-specific transcript  gene expression is markedly enhanced in the wat of mice with diet-induced and genetically caused obesity  <cit> . its expression levels are positively correlated with white fat mass, which may be related to its putative lipase activity  <cit> . resistin-like molecule alpha , which shares homology with resistin  <cit> , has also been shown to be exclusively expressed in the stromal vascular fraction of wat  <cit> .

the exact origin of brown and white adipocytes and their developmental relationship is not clear. brown and white adipocytes were previously considered to be derived from a common preadipocyte pool  <cit> . however, recent studies have suggested instead that brown adipocytes and muscle cells share a similar precursor, based on the observation that knock-down of prdm <dig>  a bat-specific gene  <cit> , switched the fate of brown adipocytes to that of muscle cells  <cit> . prdm <dig> appears to be a co-factor for cebpβ and pgc1α/β, which up-regulates the expression of many bat-selective genes while down-regulating the expression of wat-selective genes  <cit> . differentiated wat is able to develop a bat-like phenotype under special conditions including cold exposure or after the administration of a β3-agonist to wat depots  <cit> . pparγ has been shown to be required for the conversion of wat to a bat-like tissue based on the observation that this conversion is blocked in cold-acclimatized pparγ-mutant  mice  <cit> . over-expression of the cebpβ gene in cebpα-deficient mice results in increased expression of the gsα subunit, enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and increased ucp <dig> expression in wat  <cit> . the wat in mice over-expressing foxc <dig> is converted into a bat-like tissue with a corresponding increase in the expression levels of pgc <dig>  ucp <dig> and camp pathway proteins  <cit> . although many factors and regulatory pathways have been shown to play important roles in regulating the conversion of wat to a tissue with a bat-like phenotype and function, the upstream signals or factors that determine the fate of bat vs. wat and initiate the conversion of wat to a bat-like tissue remain unclear.

cide proteins, including cidea, cideb and fat specific protein  <dig> , have been identified as important regulators of various metabolic pathways  <cit> . our previous work demonstrated that cidea is expressed at high levels in bat, whereas cideb is expressed at high levels in liver. mice with a deficiency in both cidea and cideb have a higher energy expenditure, enhanced insulin sensitivity and a resistance against high-fat-diet-induced obesity and diabetes  <cit> . the fsp <dig> protein was detected at high levels in wat and at moderate levels in bat  <cit> . furthermore, cide family proteins have been shown to be associated with the lipid droplet enriched fraction  <cit>  and over-expression of fsp <dig> promotes tag storage  <cit> . fsp27-null mice have a lean phenotype and are resistant to diet-induced obesity  <cit> . in addition, the wat of fsp27-deficient mice has smaller lipid droplets as well as an increased mitochondrial size and activity  <cit> . in particular, several genes that are preferentially expressed in the bat  and several regulatory factors  are up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice  <cit> . therefore, the wat of fsp <dig> deficient mice appear to adapt certain features similar to those found in bat. the regulatory pathways and the underlying mechanism of fsp27-mediated transcriptional regulation in wat and bat, however, remain unclear. using microarray and semi-quantitative real-time pcr  analyses, we demonstrated that the wat of fsp <dig> or fsp27/leptin deficient mice have markedly increased expression of many bat-selective genes and decreased expression of wat-selective genes. in addition, the expression levels of many genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation and the tca cycle were up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, which is consistent with their increased mitochondrial activity and whole-body metabolism. in contrast, genes involved in the classic complement pathway, extracellular matrix remodeling and the tgf-β signaling pathway were down-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. most importantly, the expression of regulatory factors that activate the expression of bat-selective genes was up-regulated in the wat of fsp <dig> deficient mice, providing a molecular explanation for the increased expression of bat-selective genes and the acquisition of bat-like properties in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice.

RESULTS
alteration of the gene expression program in fsp27-deficient mice as determined by microarray analysis
to determine the extent of the physiological changes required to convert wat into a bat-like tissue and to systematically analyze the transcriptional program of wat in fsp27-deficient mice, whole gene microarray analysis was performed using affymetrix oligonucleotide arrays separately hybridized with rna from the wat of wild-type and fsp27-deficient null mice. the expression of approximately  <dig>  transcripts represented on the affymetrix mouse genome  <dig>  <dig> a microarray chips was quantified in pooled wat samples from five each of the wild-type and fsp27-deficient mice. duplicate hybridizations were performed for each sample. the genes were filtered according to the criteria of a decrease ≥ 30%  or increase ≥  <dig> -fold  in fsp27-deficient mice and consistency between the duplicate experiments. after collapsing the dataset from adjusted probes to symbols by gsea, the expression levels of  <dig>  of  <dig>  genes were changed in the wat of fsp27-/- mice . among them,  <dig>  genes  were increased, whereas  <dig>  genes  were decreased. notably, the  <dig> most highly elevated genes  include cox8b , elovl <dig> , tr <dig> downstream gene  <dig> , cidea  and cytochrome c oxidase subunit viia polypeptide . interestingly, cox8b , elovl <dig>  cidea and cox7a <dig> have been reported to be highly expressed in bat but not wat  <cit> . pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme  <dig> , an enzyme involved in pyruvate metabolism  <cit> , and the lipid droplet binding protein lsdp <dig> were also significantly increased. overall, the  <dig> most up-regulated genes in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice comprised mostly genes selectively expressed in bat. in contrast, the  <dig> most down-regulated genes involved in diverse pathways, such as proteinase  <dig>   <cit>  and retinitis pigmentosa gtpase regulator   <cit> . another of the  <dig> most down-regulated proteins is mest, a protein expressed at high levels in wat but not in bat  <cit> .

the pathways that are altered in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice were determined by gsea analysis. there were extensive changes in the expression of genes involved in many different metabolic pathways in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. most strikingly, the expression of many proteins that localize to mitochondria were significantly up-regulated . these genes are involved in the krebs/tca cycle , the electron transport chain , mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation  and fatty acid degradation . these data are consistent with our previous observation that mitochondrial biogenesis and activity is increased in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice  <cit> . in addition, the mrna levels of many genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, cholesterol biosynthesis, pantothenate and coa biosynthesis, heme biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, ros generation and the proteasome pathway were significantly up-regulated . microarray analysis also demonstrated that some of the proteins normally expressed in bat, such as pgc1α, ucp <dig> and dio <dig>  were expressed at high levels in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. furthermore, factors that inhibit bat differentiation, such as rb/p <dig>  were down-regulated in the wat of fsp27-/- mice . these data are consistent with our previous observations  <cit> .

the classic complement pathway, which plays an important role in the initiation of the inflammatory response, was significantly down-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . extracellular matrix proteins, including  <dig> members of the collagen family in particular, were significantly down-regulated . matrix metalloproteinase pathway  genes, including matrix metallopeptidases  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase  1- <dig> , were also significantly down-regulated. some genes involved in the tgf-β pathway were also down-regulated . furthermore, microarray analysis also showed that irs <dig>  akt <dig> and glut <dig>  three genes that are crucial for the regulation of insulin sensitivity, were significantly up-regulated . these data are in accordance with our previous observation that fsp27-deficient mice had increased insulin sensitivity  <cit> .

the profound increase in mitochondrial activity and the up-regulation of mitochondrial proteins can likely be attributed to the increased expression of pgc <dig>  pparα and pparγ, as had been previously seen in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. the gene expression profile in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice was compared with that of differentiated brown fat cells that were pgc1α- and pgc1β-deficient using gene set enrichment analysis   <cit> . among the  <dig>  transcripts that were significantly up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, a significant percentage of them  were down-regulated in the pgc1α-/- differentiated brown fat cells expressing an sirna specific for pgc1β knockdown, suggesting that those  <dig> genes are downstream targets of pgc1α and pgc1β . comparison of the gene expression profile in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice with that in pparγ <dig> over-expressing nih3t <dig> cells and the wat of pparα-deficient mice,  <dig> of the  <dig>   genes were significantly up-regulated in the pparγ <dig> over-expressing nih3t <dig> l <dig> cells, whereas  <dig> of the  <dig>   genes were down-regulated in the wat of pparα null mice . these data suggest that fsp <dig> acts upstream to control the expression of regulatory factors such as pgc1α and pparα/γ and thus affect the expression of the downstream targets of these regulatory factors, such as ucp <dig>  dio <dig> and cidea.

validation of the gene expression program in the wat and bat of fsp27-deficient mice by quantitative real-time pcr analysis
to validate our microarray data, qpcr analysis was used to analyze the expression levels of representative genes taken from a variety of pathways in the wat and bat of fsp27- deficient mice. in a consistent manner, the expression levels of genes selectively expressed in bat, including cox8b, elovl <dig> and ucp <dig>  were dramatically up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . the expression levels of lsdp <dig> were also up-regulated  in fsp27-deficient wat. given that fsp <dig> is also expressed in bat, the expression levels of these genes were then examined in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice. surprisingly, there were similar levels of cox8b, lsdp <dig> and ucp <dig>  but reduced expression of elovl <dig> in the bat of fsp27-/- mice . because the expression levels of many genes in various metabolic pathways are affected by obesity, we generated leptin and fsp <dig> double deficient mice  and examined the expression levels of bat-selective genes in the wat of these animals. consistent with the previous observations, the levels of cox8b, lsdp <dig> and elovl <dig> were significantly elevated  in the wat of ob/ob/fsp <dig> deficient mice compared with that of ob/ob mice , suggesting that the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice also acquired certain bat-like properties despite the significantly higher lipid accumulation in these obese mice.

the expression levels of genes selectively expressed in the wat were also examined by qpcr, which revealed that the mrna levels of mest were significantly reduced  in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. qpcr on another wat-selective gene, resistin-related protein alpha , revealed significantly lower mrna levels for retnlα  in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, suggesting that the expression of wat-selective genes was suppressed in fsp27-deficient wat. as an endocrine organ, wat can secrete various adipocytokines and inflammatory cytokines, such as adiponectin, leptin and tnfα. there was an increase in adiponectin levels and a reduction in leptin expression in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, which is consistent with their lean and insulin sensitive phenotypes . no difference in the expression of tnfα was observed between wild-type and fsp27-deficient wat . down-regulation of mest  and up-regulation of adiponectin  were also observed in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice compared with ob/ob mice. surprisingly, the mrna levels of retnlα were up-regulated in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice . the expression levels of mest and retnlα in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice were higher than those of wild-type mice . previous reports showed that ectopic expression of mest markedly enlarged the size of adipocytes and that its expression levels were positively correlated with larger adipocytes  <cit> . increased mest expression is consistent with our previous observation that the bat of fsp27-deficient mice had larger lipid droplets and increased tag accumulation  <cit> . the expression levels of resistin, another wat-selective gene, were similar in the bat of both wild-type and fsp27-deficient mice .

the expression levels of genes involved in various metabolic pathways, including lipid metabolism, uncoupling activity and mitochondrial electron transport chain activity, were then examined. the expression levels of genes involved in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, including acc <dig> , acc <dig> , and fatty acid synthase , were up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-/- mice . the expression levels of genes involved in the mitochondrial oxidative pathway  and the lipoprotein pathway, including the ldl receptor  and lipoprotein lipase , were significantly up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . interestingly, ucp <dig>  a mitochondrial uncoupling protein that is homologous to ucp <dig>  is also significantly increased, suggesting an increase in the uncoupling activity of the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. the expression levels of acc <dig>  fas, hsl, ldlr and cox  <dig> were also up-regulated in the bat of fsp27-/- mice, whereas the mrna levels for ucp <dig>  cpt <dig>  lpl and adipsin were down-regulated in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice .

to determine whether the expression levels of genes in the classic complement and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways were indeed reduced in the wat of fsp27-/- mice, as indicated by the microarray analysis, the expression levels of complement factor  <dig> , timp2/ <dig>  fibronectin <dig> , collagen  <dig> alpha  and  <dig> alpha <dig>  were measured by qpcr. the levels of timp <dig> and timp <dig> were significantly reduced in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . the levels of c <dig>  col3-α and col6-α <dig> were also reduced in the fsp27-deficient wat . interestingly, lower levels of timp <dig>  but higher levels of timp <dig>  and col6-α <dig>  were observed in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-deficient mice . no differences in the levels of col3α <dig>  c <dig> or fibronectin <dig> were observed between ob/ob and ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice .

given that lipid metabolism and mitochondrial activity are controlled by many regulatory factors in wat and bat, the expression levels of genes involved in the tgf-β and camp pathways and of genes involved in the regulation of adipogenesis were analyzed. while the mrna level of tgf-β <dig> was similar in the wat of both wild-type and fsp27-deficient mice, the mrna levels for tgf-β-receptor  <dig>  and tgfβ-induced protein , an extracellular matrix molecule induced by tgf-β that mediates the adhesion and spreading of different cell types  <cit> , were significantly down-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . interestingly, smad <dig>  a downstream mediator of the tgf-β pathway, was significantly up-regulated  in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. the expression levels of smad <dig> were also increased in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice compared with that of ob/ob mice , whereas no difference in the expression levels of tgfβ-r <dig> and tgf-βi was observed in the wat of ob/ob and ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice .

the expression levels of several regulatory factors, including cebpα and cebpβ, pref- <dig>  prdm <dig>  tr <dig> and components of the camp pathway, were further analyzed. the expression levels of cebpα and cebpβ, which are transcriptional factors controlling adipocyte differentiation and pparγ expression, were significantly increased in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice , which is consistent with the increased pparγ expression  <cit> . in contrast, the expression levels of cebpβ were significantly reduced in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice . interestingly, the expression of pref- <dig>  a unique preadipocyte marker, was reduced in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, whereas its expression level in the bat was similar between wild-type and fsp27-/- mutant mice . the expression levels of prdm <dig> in the wat of fsp27-/- mice were also significantly up-regulated compared with that of wild-type mice. the expression of tr <dig> was decreased in the bat of fsp27-/- mice . importantly, there was a significantly increased expression of the β3-adrenergic receptor , the protein kinase a catalytic subunit-α  and the gs alpha subunit . the increased expression of genes involved in the camp pathway could contribute to the activated metabolism and increased ucp <dig> expression  <cit>  found in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. the expression levels of cebpα/β, prdm <dig>  β3-ar, pkac-α and gs-α were also up-regulated in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice , which is consistent with the increased expression of bat-selective genes in these mice. furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that the protein levels of cebpβ and β3-ar were significantly increased , which is consistent with their increased mrna levels. the increased expression of bat-selective genes , cebpβ and β3-ar was also observed in the wat of young female and old male fsp27-deficient mice , suggesting that the acquisition of bat-like properties in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice occurs regardless of sex or age. interestingly, the increased expression of prdm <dig> was observed only in the wat of young male and female fsp27-/- mice but not in the wat of old mice, suggesting that the regulation of prdm <dig> expression is age-dependent.

discussion
using microarray and qpcr analyses, we demonstrated that fsp <dig> plays an important role in regulating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, adipocyte differentiation, lipolysis, fatty acid oxidation, the inflammatory response and the extracellular matrix structure by controlling extensive gene expression programs in both wat and bat. semi-quantitative real-time pcr analyses validated the reliability of the microarray data . importantly, genes that are highly enriched in bat  were drastically up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. in contrast, wat-enriched genes  were significantly down-regulated. the expression levels of the set of wat-selective genes that were defined by kajimura et al  <cit>  were specifically examined in our microarray analyses . a subset of these genes is down-regulated but others are up-regulated, suggesting that these genes are controlled by different mechanisms. the bat-like phenotype of fsp27-deficient wat was further supported by its significantly elevated expression of many genes involved in the regulation of the tca cycle, the electron transport chain, uncoupling activity and the fatty acid oxidation pathway, resulting in its conversion from an energy storage organ to an energy consumption organ. the increased expression of bat-selective genes and enhanced expression of genes involved in various metabolic pathways in the wat of fsp27-/- mice are likely due to the up-regulation of several regulatory factors: 1) cebpα and cebpβ, which activate pparγ expression and promote adipogenesis; 2) prdm <dig>  which promotes the differentiation of preadipocytes and myoblasts into brown adipocytes; 3) pparα/γ and pgc <dig> and their downstream target genes  <cit> ; and 4) several genes in the camp signaling pathway , which promote the conversion of white to brown adipocytes by inducing ucp <dig> expression and mitochondrial activity in white adipose depots. therefore, the up-regulation of cebpα/β and prdm <dig> may act as an initial step to increase the expression of pparα/γ and pgc <dig> and promote adipocyte differentiation. the increased expression of pparα/γ, pgc <dig> and the proteins involved in camp signaling in conjunction with the reduced expression of rb, p <dig> and rip <dig>  <cit>  may act in concert to up-regulate genes specifically expressed in bat and genes involved in energy metabolism, which in turn would promote the conversion of wat to a bat-like tissue in fsp27-deficient mice.

the underlying mechanism responsible for the increased expression of cebpβ and prdm <dig> in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice is not understood. pref- <dig>  which inhibits adipocyte differentiation via the upregulation of sox <dig>  was down-regulated, likely resulting in a reduction in the expression levels of sox <dig>  <cit> . sox <dig> can bind to the promoters for cebpβ and cebpδ, which would consequently suppress the activity of those promoters resulting in the reduced expression of pref- <dig> and possibly sox <dig> in the wat of fsp27- deficient mice. this cascade of events could, therefore, lead to the up-regulation of cebpβ/δ. in addition, adiponectin was up-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice . adiponectin and its receptors have been reported to induce extracellular ca2+ influx and activate ca2+ /calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta , ampk and sirt <dig>  resulting in an increase in the expression of pgc-1α  <cit> . therefore, the up-regulation of adiponectin may contribute to the increased levels of bat-specific genes. in addition, cebpβ has been shown to be phosphorylated and activated in response to an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, which was caused by the activation of camkkβ  <cit> . the mechanism responsible for the transcriptional regulation of cebpβ and prdm <dig> in the wat of fsp <dig> deficient mice remains to be clarified.

our previous study indicated that the conversion of wat to a bat-like tissue in fsp27-deficient mice could be partially recapitulated in differentiated mouse embryonic fibroblasts  isolated from fsp27-deficient mice. the differentiated fsp27-deficient mefs showed characteristics such as increased lipolysis, smaller but multiple lipid droplets and reduced tag storage. more importantly, the fsp27-deficient mefs had an increased rate of fatty acid oxidation and higher expression levels of pgc1α, cidea, ucp <dig> and cox <dig> in the presence of t <dig>  <cit> . the relative expression levels of these bat-selective genes in differentiated fsp27-deficient mefs, however, were not as high as those seen in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice  <cit> . for example, the mrna levels of cidea and ucp <dig> are similar between wild-type and fsp27-/- mefs, and the level of cox <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher in fsp27-/- mefs compared with that of wild-type cells. in the fsp27-deficient wat, in contrast, mrna levels of these three genes were  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold increased, respectively  <cit> . in addition, there was no difference in the expression of bat-selective genes and mitochondrial activity between differentiated wild-type and fsp <dig> knock-down 3t3-l <dig> cells . in differentiated fsp <dig> knock-down 3t3-l <dig> cells, keller et al. also observed no difference in the expression of bat-selective genes  <cit> . the discrepancy between the wat of fsp27-deficient mice and in vitro cultured fsp <dig> deficient adipocytes may be due to the lack of crucial extracellular factors that cooperate with fsp <dig> to determine the bat identity in cultured adipocytes. alternatively, the commitment to the transition of wat into bat-like tissue in fsp27-/- mice may occur before differentiation at the precursor stage. further experiments will be needed to distinguish these possibilities.

interestingly, there was a significantly reduced expression of genes involved in tgf-β signaling in the wat of fsp27-/- mice. because activation of the tgf-β signaling pathway was shown to inhibit adipocyte differentiation  <cit> , reduced tgf-β signaling may further enhance white adipocyte differentiation in fsp27-deficient mice. the classic complement pathway, which plays a key role in the initiation of the inflammatory response in adipose tissue under obese and insulin-resistant conditions  <cit> , was significantly down-regulated in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice, implicating a reduced inflammatory response in the wat. these data were also consistent with our previous observation that fsp27-deficient mice had improved insulin sensitivity and a lean phenotype  <cit> . finally, a significantly reduced expression of collagen family proteins, mmps and timps, which all play key roles in determining the three-dimensional  structure of the wat and in controlling extracellular matrix  remodeling  <cit> , was observed in the wat of fsp27-deficient mice. these data suggest that the 3-d structure and, in particular, the ecm structure of fsp27-deficient wat is different from that of wild-type mice, which may be reflected in its reduced adipocyte size and reduced inflammatory response. as main components of extracellular matrix, the levels of collagen family proteins are generally up-regulated in the adipose tissue of diabetic mice  <cit> . in addition, animals with a disruption of collagen vi, a predominant collagen in adipose tissue, have larger adipocytes but improved insulin sensitivity  <cit> . the decreased ecm pathway may contribute to the reduced lipid storage in white adipocytes and the improved insulin sensitivity in fsp27-deficient mice.

using leptin/fsp <dig> double deficient mice as a model system, the expression of bat-selective genes and regulatory factors was analyzed under the conditions of fsp <dig> deficiency and obesity. bat-selective genes and key metabolic regulators  and members of the camp signaling pathway  were all up-regulated in the fsp27/leptin double deficient mice, which is consistent with that seen under the condition of fsp <dig> deficiency alone. thus, white adipocytes in fsp <dig> and leptin double deficient mice also acquire bat-like properties and become an energy consuming organ. the expression profile of the genes involved in tgf-β signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling and the classic complement pathway in the wat of ob/ob/fsp27-/- mice, however, was different from that of fsp <dig> deficient mice. this observation indicated that gene expression in these pathways in obese animals requires the cooperative action of fsp <dig> and other extrinsic factors.

paradoxically, the gene expression profile in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice was dramatically different from that of the fsp27-deficient wat based on the following observations: 1) in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice, there was a significantly increased expression of wat-selective markers  that are normally suppressed by the expression of prdm16; 2) the expression of several mitochondrial genes  was down-regulated; and 3) the expression levels of regulatory factors including cebpβ and tr <dig> were reduced in the bat of fsp27-deficient mice, whereas the expression of components in the camp pathway was similar to that of wild-type mice. the mechanism by which the expression profile of bat of fsp27-deficient mice differs from that of wat remains unclear. given that cidea is expressed at a high level in bat, it may replace fsp <dig> and perform some of the functions of fsp <dig>  further analysis using cidea/fsp <dig> double knock-out mice will be needed to address the role of these individual genes in bat.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our data suggest that fsp <dig> acts as a crucial factor that controls the expression of genes involved in various regulatory and metabolic pathways in wat and bat. fsp <dig> deficiency results in the up-regulation of regulatory factors that promote the activation of bat-selective genes and genes involved in energy expenditure processes such as mitochondrial activity. the coordinated regulation of such profound transcriptional networks that affect multiple metabolic and signaling pathways is an interesting property of fsp27-deficient mice. although the precise mechanism by which fsp <dig> regulates these gene expression programs is not clear, our study strongly suggests that fsp <dig> is an important molecular determinant in controlling gene expression networks and in maintaining white adipocyte identity.
