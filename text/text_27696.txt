BACKGROUND
polyploidisation is considered to be a major creative force in plant evolution since approximately 70% of angiosperm lineages underwent whole-genome duplications during their evolution  <cit> . in most cases genome doubling comes along with interspecific hybridization  and the genetic outcomes of these combined events are manifold and not easy to predict  <cit> . in principle the evolutionary fate of duplicated genes, including homeologs generated by polyploidization, can result in 1) the retention and co-expression of all copies, 2) loss or silencing of some copies , 3) development of complementary copy-specific functions  and 4) divergence between copies leading to acquisition of new functions   <cit> . in case of co-expression of duplicated genes allopolyploids have to cope with negative effects of increased gene dosage, thus most genes are expressed at mid-parent levels  <cit> . the potential for reprogramming of genetic systems increases the plasticity to react on changing environments, buffers the effect of deleterious mutations and is probably responsible for the evolutionary success of polyploids  <cit> . a disadvantageous effect of polyploidy is the possible disturbance of meiosis by doubled chromosomes which may prevent correct bivalent formation  <cit> . however, newly formed allopolyploids can maintain sexual reproduction in the majority of cases because stable bivalent formation during meiosis is enhanced by the divergence between homeologous chromosomes. contrary, the establishment of anorthoploid  hybrids is based on asexual reproduction, e. g. in crepis l., rubus l. and taraxacum f.h. wigg  <cit> . peculiar exceptions among these anorthoploids are the mostly pentaploid sexual european dogroses  ser.). section caninae originated by multiple hybridization events  <cit>  and overcame the sterility bottleneck due to odd ploidy by the development of a unique meiosis mechanism regaining sexual reproduction  <cit> . this meiotic system is unique in plants, but other meiosis systems leading to comparable effects have been observed e.g. in the sexual triploid plant leucopogon juniperinus r.br.   <cit>  and the triploid hybrid fish squalius alburnoides  <cit> . high ploidy levels and sexuality have probably been the prerequisites for the evolutionary success of dogroses after the retreat of pleistocenic ice shields, because dogroses are very widely spread in central europe and occur on a broad range of different habitats, whereas diploid and tetraploid species of other sections of rosa are mainly found in glacial refugia  <cit> .

the so-called canina-meiosis produces haploid pollen grains  and tetraploid egg cells  which merge to pentaploid zygotes . a very similar process is observed in tetraploid dogroses , which form also haploid pollen grains  but triploid egg cells . bivalent formation and thus recombination occurs always between chromosomes of the same two highly homologous sets, one transmitted by the pollen grain and the other by the egg cell. the remaining chromosomes are exclusively transmitted by the egg cell and do not undergo chromosome pairing  <cit> . thus, canina-meiosis unites intrinsically sexual reproduction  and apomixis . previous studies demonstrated that the number of different nuclear ribosomal dna families and microsatellite alleles was always lower than the maximum number expected from ploidy level of investigated plants, thus one allele is always present in at least two identical copies  <cit> . research on artificial hybrids revealed that alleles with identical copies are located on bivalent forming chromosomes and refer probably to an extinct diploid proto-caninae ancestor, whereas the copies located on univalents are more diverged between each other  <cit> . studying expression patterns of rdna loci within five different dogrose species khaitová et al.  observed stable expression patterns of rdna families on bivalent-forming genomes in contrast to frequent silencing of rdnas from univalent-forming genomes  <cit> .

in this study we wanted to determine whether the differential behaviour of chromosomes during meiosis is mirrored in gene divergence and expression patterns of homeologs by the analysis of three marker genes in rosa canina l. therefore, we analysed the extent of molecular divergence between alleles of two single copy genes: leafy and cytosolic glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase ; and between families of nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacers . leafy encodes a transcription factor which controls floral meristem identity  <cit>  and cgapdh encodes an essential enzyme of glycolysis. nuclear ribosomal its is part of the 18s- <dig> s- <dig> s ribosomal dna cluster, which is organized in long tandem arrays in one nucleolus organizer region  per genome in dogroses  <cit> . the apparent absence of interlocus homogenization between nors  <cit>  allows tracking different dogrose genomes by diagnostic its families  <cit> . the sequence information obtained from the homeologs of the three marker genes was then used for allele-specific transcription analyses using pyrosequencing.

RESULTS
gene copy numbers
southern hybridizations were performed to estimate the copy numbers of leafy and cgapdh in rosa canina . one to three fragments were detected in the digestions of genomic dna by six different enzymes hybridized against probes of leafy or cgapdh. the maximum number of three fragments within the digestions did not contradict against the expectation for leafy and cgapdh to have one copy per each dogrose genome, because we expected a maximum number of five bands in pentaploids. variation in the observed one to three bands result either from restriction sites of the enzymes hincii and hindiii within the range of the probe for some of the alleles or from variation of the number of cutting sites between dogrose genomes.

allelic variation
we sequenced approximately  <dig> bp of leafy in seven individuals of rosa canina; only the first about  <dig> bp downstream of the translation start codon and the last about  <dig> bp upstream of the stop codon were missing. we detected four different alleles of leafy termed leafy- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> and - <dig> . we did not sample the allele leafy- <dig> directly by cloning analysis in the individuals h <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but we detected it with the help of pcr using leafy- <dig> -specific primers . genomic sequences of alleles differed between each other by  <dig> % -  <dig> %; their coding sequences contained no premature stop codons and  <dig> amino acid substitutions in total . the analysed plants were pentaploid implying that one of the leafy alleles had two copies, which was allele leafy- <dig> determined by pyrosequencing of an allele-specific single nucleotide polymorphism  in genomic dna .

ω =  <dig> 
*sequences of coding region are not complete, approximately  <dig> bp are missing in leafy and approximately  <dig> bp are missing in cgapdh at both ends to start and stop codon, respectively.

we isolated approximately  <dig> bp of the cgapdh sequence in five individuals of r. canina; only the first about  <dig> bp downstream of the translation start codon and the last about  <dig> bp upstream of the stop codon were missing. we found four different alleles of cgapdh in individual h <dig> and three different alleles in the other individuals . using allele-specific primers the allele cgapdh- <dig> could be detected in all individuals but the allele cgapdh- <dig> only in individual h <dig> . genomic sequences of alleles were very similar to each other  and we detected only five amino acid substitutions and no premature stop codons in the coding region . allele frequency determination of genomic dna indicated that allele cgapdh- <dig> has three copies in h <dig> and h <dig> and two copies in h <dig> .

we identified three different alleles of nrits in the plants h <dig> and h <dig> and four alleles in h <dig> . the alleles canina- <dig>  rugosa and woodsii were identical to sequences found in a previous study  <cit> , but allele canina- <dig> was sampled for the first time. whereas in case of leafy and cgapdh the same allele was present in multiple copies in all plants we observed that the two closely related alleles canina- <dig> and canina- <dig>  had several copies. we determined three copies of the canina- <dig> allele in h <dig> and h <dig>  we concluded from base frequencies at the snps measured in the genomic dna samples of h <dig> that this individual had two copies of the canina- <dig> and one copy of the canina- <dig> allele. however, base frequency at snp  <dig> specific for the canina- <dig> and canina- <dig> allele is higher  than expected .

in all three marker genes we hardly observed any variation between sequences of one clade isolated from different individuals . within the leafy- <dig> and leafy- <dig> clade sequences of two individuals formed statistically supported sub-clades . sequences of leafy- <dig> h <dig> and h <dig> differed from the remaining leafy- <dig> sequences by one substitution in intron 3; sequences of leafy- <dig> h <dig> and  <dig> differed by one synonymous substitution in the coding region and three substitutions in the non-coding region. following a strict definition these sequences have to be treated as different alleles. however, for pragmatic reasons we decided to summarize them as leafy- <dig> and leafy- <dig> alleles, respectively, because sequences were very closely related and the individuals contained only one of the respective alleles. tree topologies based on genomic sequences  were identical to those based on coding regions only, but posterior probabilities were higher using genomic sequences . in order to investigate the differential evolution between alleles present in multiple copies and single copy alleles we estimated the relative rate of substitutions between different alleles of leafy and cgapdh by relative rate test , but no pair of sequences rejected the null hypothesis of equal branch lengths for all alleles . selection analyses using codeml  revealed that alleles of leafy and cgapdh evolved under purifying selection . in both genes the models assuming different selective regimes between alleles with multiple copies and singly copy alleles were not significantly better than the null hypothesis .

allele-specific transcription
we found five snps in the coding region of leafy, three snps of cgapdh and five snps of nrits which were specific for a certain allele and suitable for allele frequency determination by pyrosequencing . we compared the frequency of allele specific bases between samples from cdna pools and genomic dna to estimate the relative level of transcription for each allele. base frequencies obtained from genomic dna indicate the copy number of an allele and represent the null hypothesis . the frequency of the allele-specific bases in cdna-pools did not vary between plants  and between small and large flower buds .

in leafy the frequency of the allele-specific bases of all investigated snps differed significantly from the null hypothesis . transcription level of the allele leafy- <dig> with two copies in all investigated plants was  <dig> -fold lower, but transcription levels of single copy alleles leafy- <dig> and leafy- <dig> was approximately  <dig> -fold higher than expected . we could not estimate the transcription level of leafy- <dig>  because no suitable snp was available.

contrary to the results of leafy, transcription of cgapdh- <dig> with three copies in plants h <dig> and h <dig> and two copies in h <dig> was  <dig> -fold higher than expected under the null hypothesis . base frequency of allele cgapdh- <dig> with presumably one genomic copy was slightly lower than expected, but the difference was only marginally significant. transcription level of allele cgapdh- <dig> was significantly higher than expected from genomic dna. transcription of cgapdh- <dig> sampled only in plant h <dig> could not be analysed, because we detected no specific snp in the coding region suitable for pyrosequencing.

in nrits we did not observe significant differences between the frequency of allele-specific bases of cdna-pools and genomic dna in any of the alleles, so that the null hypothesis of equal transcription was not rejected .

discussion
in this study we investigated by the analysis of two single copy genes and one ribosomal dna locus, whether sequence divergence and transcription levels differ between homeologous nuclear genes in pentaploid rosa canina. we were interested to determine whether the fate of a homeolog depends on its copy number and thus very likely on whether it is localized on bivalent forming chromosomes undergoing recombination, or on univalent chromosomes, which are transmitted "apomictically"  to the offspring in dogroses.

sequence divergence between alleles
we detected a maximum number of four different alleles in the analysed genes in pentaploid rosa canina  suggesting that at least one allele has two or more identical copies, which is in accordance with previous research  <cit> . these studies based on rdna loci and microsatellites from different linkage groups demonstrated that the alleles with identical copies were always transmitted by pollen grains and egg cells and therefore must be located on bivalent forming chromosomes, whereas the remaining alleles are exclusively maternally inherited via univalent chromosomes. it is assumed that chromosome sets forming bivalents refer to a probably extinct diploid proto-caninae progenitor characterized by the canina-its type  so far solely found in polyploid dogroses . however, this unique nrits type might also have arisen by mutation as shown for the hybrid-specific rdna units in nicotiana allopolyploids  <cit> . the preservation of homeologs in dogroses is not exceptional and has often been used to track the hybridogenic origin of allopolyploids, e.g.  <cit> . however, loss of homeologs has been observed in other very recently evolved hybridogenic species  <cit> . these cases of massive gene loss are mainly documented in herbaceous plants, while dogroses are woody and have much longer generation times. our data correspond with the situation found in allotetraploid cotton for which gene loss seems not to be a common phenomenon accompanying allopolyploidy  <cit> .

the results found for the nrits region are comparable but more complicated than those of the single copy genes leafy and cgapdh, because nrits is part of a gene family, large tandem repeats of ribosomal dna loci, whose copies are normally homogenized by mechanisms of concerted evolution  <cit> . however, in dogroses homeologous rdna clusters are also preserved, because sequences are mainly homogenized within one locus but not between loci  <cit> . in contrast to this, some rdna families were physically lost, degenerated or were overwritten by more dominant ones in other well studied allopolyploid systems  <cit> .

during our analyses we found very few chimeric sequences  and all of them were unique, thus these sequences originated most likely by stochastic pcr recombination  <cit> . this apparent absence of recombinant alleles is concordant with the study of khaitová et al.   <cit>  in dogroses and corresponds with results from nicotiana demonstrating that recombination between nuclear glutamine synthetase sequences occurred in diploid but not in allopolyploid nicotiana hybrids  <cit> . in contrast, recombinant alleles between progenitor sequences were observed in allopolyploid gossypium  <cit>  and tragopogon  <cit> .

in none of the investigated genes we observed signs of loss of function for homeologs . moreover, relative rate tests for leafy and cgapdh did not detect differential rates of sequence evolution between alleles of one locus. selection analyses revealed that all homeologs evolved under purifying selection and did not detect differential selective regimes between them . these results suggest that all homeologs of investigated loci are fully functional. however, only eight non-synonymous substitutions in leafy and only one non-synonymous in cgapdh  were observed, so that sequence divergence might not suffice to detect different selective regimes.

differential transcription of homeologous alleles
all homeologs of the marker genes investigated here were co-expressed, but transcription levels deviated from values expected from genomic copy number for many homeologs. co-expression has been observed for the majority of homeologous genes in allopolyploid systems  <cit> . we found no evidence for complete epigenetic silencing of a homeolog, which has been reported for cgapdh and ribosomal dnas in allotetraploid tragopogon  <cit>  and for nrits in several other pentaploid dogrose species  <cit> .

differences in transcription level were most strongly pronounced in leafy displaying a significantly lower transcription for leafy- <dig> with two genomic copies and a higher transcription for homeologs with one copy than expected from the copy number . we observed contrary but less pronounced results for cgapdh. alleles with two or more copies were more strongly expressed than expected from genomic copy number . for nuclear ribosomal rna we detected no deviation from the expected transcription level . these results demonstrate that transcription level is not directly related to copy number of alleles. analogous to results from microsatellites and rdna loci  <cit>  we assume that alleles with two copies are located on the bivalent forming chromosomes, even though alternative scenarios cannot be completely ruled out at the moment. following this assumption our results suggest that there is no general evolutionary fate for a homeolog located on a bivalent- or univalent-forming chromosome. comparable results were obtained in case of the triploid hybrid fish squalidus alburnoides for which silencing patterns for dosage compensation were rather gene- than genome-specific  <cit> . according to the above cited studies we presume that leafy homeologs with one copy are located on the univalent chromosomes. the increased transcription of these leafy alleles  provides an example that genetic information from non-recombining genomes is functional and active. this contrasts findings from nicotiana allopolyploids for which an inverse correlation between silencing and the intensity of inter-genomic recombination has been proposed  <cit> . it is a matter of speculation whether the pronounced transcription differences in leafy represents an exception because leafy is an transcription factor expressed in floral organs whereas the two other loci cgapdh and nrits are expressed in every tissue, but recent studies demonstrate that gene classification is not a strong predictor for differential expression patterns  <cit> .

contrary to our results khaitová et al. , who investigated six different dogrose species based on cleaved amplified polymorphism sequence  analysis, concluded that nrits- <dig> copies located on univalent genomes are more frequently silenced than loci from bivalent forming genomes  <cit> . using the same marker but pyrosequencing for transcription analysis we did not find any differential transcription of rdna loci in rosa canina. however, according to the results of khaitová et al.  <dig>  differences in transcription level of rdna alleles were less pronounced in r. canina compared to other dogrose species, e.g. r. rubiginosa l.  <cit> . differences between the two studies might be caused by the origin of ribosomal rna, which was extracted from leaves by khaitová et al.  and from two different stages of flower buds here  <cit> . gene expression has shown to be organ-specific  <cit>  and varies strongly between leaves and floral tissues in allopolyploids  <cit> . moreover, rrna genes which were silenced in leaves were expressed in floral organs in brassica  <cit> . we did not find differences in expression patterns between very young and elder flower buds, whereas such developmentally dependent expression patterns were shown in cotton  <cit> . our results might also be influenced by the method of reverse transcription. we used oligo-dt primers, which are suited for rna polymerase ii products with polyadenylated 3' ends but the poly stretch is normally absent in functional rrnas and present in intermediates of a rna degradation pathway  <cit> . however, we do not expect a strong impact of these rare degradation products on our results because conditions of reverse transcription were not stringent and rrnas were highly overrepresented in rna templates.

CONCLUSIONS
we analysed three marker genes to investigate homeolog-specific transcription levels in pentaploid dogroses. based on previous research we assume that alleles located on bivalent-forming  chromosomes have identical copies  <cit> . we could show that sequence divergence and transcription intensity is not always strongly correlated with the copy number of alleles. thus we found no evidence that genetic information on non-recombining genomes is degraded or less functional than genes from recombining chromosomes. the absence of differential selection between dogrose genomes is surprising because it is assumed that sect. caninae originated during miocene to pliocene   <cit>  and fossils of rose hips were found in deposits of the lower oligocene   <cit> ). contrary, massive gene loss and heavily changed expression profiles have been observed in other very young allopolyploids even after a few generations  <cit> . despite the preferential pairing of two homologous chromosome sets during meiosis, dogroses are functional diploids in terms of chromosome pairing as suggested by grant   <cit> ; however, they are no functional diploids in terms of genome activity, since they transcribe genes and thus use information from all involved genomes. this might be a selective advantage because polyploid dogroses dominate central european rose populations and repel diploid wild roses towards more or less isolated habitats  <cit> . their success could be caused by fixing heterozygosity on univalent genomes on one hand and escaping the evolutionary bottleneck of complete apomixis by maintaining recombination between bivalents on the other hand. the heterogeneous results from our analysis demand further research on the transcriptome of dogroses which considers a broader sampling of species and genes and accounts also for possible tissue-specific differences.
