BACKGROUND
mirnas
mirnas are among the most abundant and extensively studied class of small non-coding rna. mirnas are estimated to regulate the expression of up to 60% of mammalian protein coding genes
 <cit>  and are associated with many economically important traits in domestic livestock
 <cit> . the biosynthesis of mirna is comprised of multiple stages. the initial stage involves transcription of the mirna gene to produce primary mirnas, several hundred base-pairs in length, followed by the generation of  <dig> nucleotide-long hairpin shaped pre-mirnas. finally, dicer-mediated processing results in the mature ~22 bp mirna
 <cit> . mirna-mediated interference involves imperfect base-pairing of mirnas, typically to the 3' utr of the target mrna. mirnas have been reported to regulate gene expression in various biological pathways including those involved in metabolism and energy homeostasis
 <cit> . in addition, mirnas have been implicated in a wide variety of diseases
 <cit> . the regulatory role of mirnas in liver disease such as hepatitis, diet induced non-alcoholic fatty liver, alcoholic and non-alcoholic hepatocellular carcinoma and cirrhosis have been reported in humans and demonstrated in mouse liver studies
 <cit> . in the case of beef cows, both liver specific and ubiquitously expressed mirnas have been reported
 <cit> . in another cow liver study, mirnas were suggested as biomarkers for anabolic steroid abuse screening
 <cit> . in addition, alterations in hepatic mirnas in lambs have been associated with periconceptional changes in maternal nutrition
 <cit> .

negative energy balance
the postpartum period is of critical importance for the general and reproductive health of dairy cows
 <cit> . during the early postpartum period energy expenditure for maintenance and lactation exceeds energy intake from nutrition resulting in neb
 <cit> . neb increases the risk of other metabolic disorders such as ketosis and fatty liver and animals are prone to infectious diseases, including mastitis, due to reduced immunity
 <cit> . neb has profound effects on the liver, which undergoes many physiological and biochemical changes to counteract the energy imbalance
 <cit> . an energy balance model of early lactation dairy cows was developed previously
 <cit>  resulting in two groups of cows with mneb and sneb. alterations in gene expression in the liver associated with sneb have been reported in two previous studies
 <cit> .

in the first study,  <dig> genes were found to be differentially expressed due to sneb using microarray-based expression profiling
 <cit> . in the second study, using rna-seq,  <dig> genes were shown to be differentially expressed
 <cit>  with  <dig> differentially expressed genes in common between the two studies. both of these studies report the alteration of genes involved in lipid metabolism the main biological process altered during sneb. the mechanisms, however, mediating these alterations in transciptome expression are yet to be fully understood. in a microarray-based and rt-qpcr validated study of liver mirnas from this neb model, five mirnas were found to be up-regulated in sneb
 <cit> . microarray expression profiling, however, is limited to the pre-defined probe sets on the array and only relative expression of mirnas can be measured. on the other hand with rna sequencing  it is possible to measure the expression of all putative mirnas in a sample
 <cit> . as mirna activity and function depend on abundance
 <cit> , accurate quantification of mirna abundance is important
 <cit> . mirna sequencing is based on short read rna-seq and involves generation and high-throughput sequencing of 50 bp cdna reads derived from the small rna fraction of total rna
 <cit> .

the objectives of this study were to  carry out an in-depth global analysis of the hepatic mirna content of postpartum dairy cows, including their overall abundance and differential expression, in mneb and sneb using rna sequencing and  to computationally identify putative targets of differentially expressed mirnas among differentially expressed hepatic genes reported previously in dairy cows in sneb.

RESULTS
in total, more than  <dig> million reads were sequenced from eight cdna libraries. of these, more than  <dig> million reads passed quality control filters and just over  <dig> million reads aligned uniquely to ensembl annotated genes in the umd_ <dig>  assembly of the bovine genome. a summary of the data is provided in table 
 <dig> and detailed statistics in additional file

discussion
the postpartum increase in milk production in high yielding dairy cows is accompanied by increased nutritional and energetic demands. this results in 10– <dig> weeks of neb in all high-yielding dairy cows
 <cit> . previous reports have shown that sneb affects the expression of multiple genes in the liver, including genes involved in lipid and glucose metabolism and homeostasis
 <cit> . hepatic mirnas have been reported to play a role in hepatic functions and disorders in human and mouse
 <cit> . in addition mirnas are reported to be associated with energy metabolism through their role in modulation of glucose and lipid homeostasis
 <cit> . the mirna profile of mneb and sneb dairy cow liver two weeks postpartum in this study shows some degree of similarity with hepatic mirna profiles of other animals including human, mouse, rat, and beef cows.

abundantly expressed mirnas in postpartum dairy cow liver
this is the first liver mirna-seq profiling study of moderate yielding dairy cows in the first two weeks postpartum. the most dominant among the ten highly abundant mirnas in our study, mir- <dig>  is a liver-specific conserved mirna. this dominance of expression by mir- <dig> is consistent with previous studies in dairy
 <cit>  and beef cows
 <cit>  where mir- <dig> was reported to be only expressed in liver, when compared with other tissues, and constituted more than 57% of all the mirna reported in liver
 <cit> . in addition, mir- <dig> has been reported to account for 70% of the total mirnas in human liver
 <cit> . tissue specific roles of mir- <dig> are well established in human and mir- <dig> has been implicated in the hepatic disorders hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatocellular carcinoma
 <cit> . furthermore, the antagonism of mir- <dig> was reported to result in disruptions of cholesterol and lipid metabolism in mice
 <cit> . the second most abundant mirna in our study mir- <dig> has been associated with cellular responses to glucose stimulus
 <cit>  and was also reported to be one of the most highly expressed after mir- <dig> in human liver mirna studies
 <cit>  and in a mouse liver study
 <cit> . mir- <dig> unlike mir- <dig> is not a liver specific mirna and has also been reported to have important roles in human and bovine renal tissues and functions
 <cit> . five of the thirteen members of the let- <dig> family are also highly expressed in this study including let-7c, let-7i, let-7 g, mir- <dig> and let-7-f. the let- <dig> family members have been associated with hepatic development and disorders as well as glucose and insulin metabolism
 <cit> . over-expression of let-7c in human liver was implicated in hepatocytes oxidant injury
 <cit>  while let-7 g was demonstrated to suppress hcc metastasis in a mouse model
 <cit> . mir- <dig>  which is also among the highly expressed mirnas in this study, has been reported to be abundantly expressed in human and mouse liver with implications in liver function and disorders
 <cit> .

differentially expressed mirnas in postpartum dairy cow liver in sneb
only one mirna, mir- <dig> was found to be differentially expressed in this study using mirna-seq and subsequently validated by rt-qpcr. this may have been due in part to the fact that most of the sequence reads in this study came from a small number of mirnas possibly limiting the power of rna-seq to accurately estimate the abundance of the more lowly expressed mirnas. less abundant mirnas would not be affected to the same extent in a microarray based approach which has probes corresponding to known mirnas. in a previous microarray-based study of the same animals, ten mirnas were found to be differentially expressed; five of which were validated using rt-qpcr
 <cit> . in this study, one additional mirna bta-mir- <dig>  would have been declared differentially expressed were it not excluded from the analysis due to having read counts below the lower threshold criterion of  <dig> reads per million. in addition, in this study a cut-off of  <dig> nts in length was used in the analysis, whereas in the microarray study, mir- <dig> which was found to be differentially expressed is  <dig> nts in length.

mir- <dig>  a highly expressed mirna in this study, is down-regulated in sneb. mir- <dig> is not liver-specific, however its tissue-enriched expression has been reported in human
 <cit>  chicken
 <cit> , rat
 <cit>  and mouse
 <cit>  liver. in the case of human, mir- <dig> has been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma. in the rat study, mir- <dig> was demonstrated to regulate activation and proliferation of myofibroblastic hepatic stellate cells  while in the mouse study mir- <dig> was shown to regulate glucose metabolism in vitro, and was associated with hepatic insulin regulation. in addition, mir- <dig> has been found to be ubiquitously expressed in bovine tissues including liver
 <cit>  and has also been associated with bovine intramuscular fat proliferation and differentiation
 <cit>  and high back fat deposition in crossbred beef cattle
 <cit> .

some important predicted gene targets of mirna mir-143
of the  <dig> putative targets of mir- <dig> which have been reported previously to be up-regulated in sneb, lrp <dig> is involved in lipid metabolism and is of particular interest because the metabolism of lipids is altered during sneb
 <cit> . lrp <dig> is implicated in lipid metabolism through its role as a receptor for sterols, steroid hormones bound to carrier proteins
 <cit>  like lipoproteins
 <cit>  and apolipoprotein m of liver
 <cit> . a study of mirna based modulation of obesity also reported lrp <dig> as a putative target of mir-130a, with roles in lipid metabolism
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
from a global examination of mirna expression in the liver of postpartum dairy cattle ten highly expressed mirnas dominate. tissue specific mir- <dig> and liver enriched mir- <dig> are two of the most abundant mirnas in the postpartum dairy cow liver. mir- <dig> is significantly down-regulated in sneb and putative targets of mirna- <dig> up-regulated in sneb, include lrp <dig> a good candidate as a potential mediator of the metabolic effects of neb.
