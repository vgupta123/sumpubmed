BACKGROUND
selenium is a rare trace element mainly present in biological systems as a selenocysteine , an amino acid found in proteins called selenoproteins and encountered in all lineages of life. insertion of the sec residue occurs through a recoded uga stop codon which is recognized by a complex machinery involving a secondary structure present in the 3'utr region of the mrna , which interacts during translation with specific factors, such as sbp <dig>  and eefsec , leading to sec insertion rather than termination  <cit> . in mammals, about  <dig> selenoproteins have been described  <cit> . most of them are enzymes involved in oxidation-reduction reactions, with the selenocysteine residue usually located in the catalytic site and conferring a strong enzymatic reactivity  <cit> . moreover, most selenoproteins are expressed early during development  <cit>  and for several of them an essential role in embryogenesis has been established  <cit> . selenium deficiency has been associated with different syndromes, such as keshan cardiomyopathy, white muscle disease or rigid lamb syndrome, leading to dietary intake recommendations for humans and livestock  <cit> . notably, mutations were identified in the sepn <dig> gene, encoding selenoprotein n , as the genetic cause for rigid spine muscular dystrophy   <cit> . this pathology is characterized by axial weakness, severe scoliosis usually requiring surgery, and respiratory insufficiency due to respiratory muscles weakness and necessitating mechanical nocturnal ventilation  <cit> . sepn <dig> mutations were subsequently associated with three other neuromuscular disorders: the classical form of multi-minicore disease   <cit> , rare cases of desmin-related myopathy with mallory body-like inclusions   <cit>  and of congenital fibre type disproportion   <cit> . these four early onset autosomal recessive pathologies exhibit clinical and morphological overlaps; they are now grouped and termed sepn1-related myopathies .

we showed previously that seln is a glycoprotein located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . in humans, its expression appeared ubiquitous and was down-regulated during myoblast differentiation in culture, and in the transition from foetal to adult tissues  <cit> . in zebrafish, an early expression of sepn <dig> was shown during embryogenesis, specifically in somites, the tail bud and the notochord  <cit> . furthermore, sepn <dig> zebrafish mutants obtained by morpholino injection, exhibited strong developmental defects such as tail malformations, disorganisation of somite borders, and abnormalities in muscles development and architecture  <cit> . these data, as well as the early onset of the human pathology, clearly pointed to a possible role for seln during muscle development. interestingly, physical and functional interactions between seln and ryanodine receptors  were recently demonstrated, indicating that seln may regulate ryr activity in muscles  <cit> .

here, we characterized extensively the expression pattern of sepn <dig> in mouse during pre- and post-natal development, in several tissues, particularly in skeletal muscles. we demonstrated that sepn <dig> is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis and that it is restricted to specific areas, including muscle precursors, at mid-gestation stages. in isolated tissues, mild variations of sepn <dig> transcripts were detected between ages, whereas the protein expression was strikingly down-regulated during the perinatal period, indicating post-transcriptional regulations of sepn <dig> expression during development.

RESULTS
spatio-temporal dynamics of sepn <dig> expression
in whole embryos, sepn <dig> expression was detected by qrt-pcr as early as e <dig> , with higher levels from e <dig>  to e <dig>  . we then observed a five fold reduction of the expression from e <dig>  to e <dig>  . this decrease was confirmed at the protein level by western blot since seln was reduced by more than two fold in e <dig>  embryos compared to e <dig>  .

we then investigated sepn <dig> expression in isolated quadriceps, diaphragm and non-skeletal-muscle tissues  from late embryonic stages  to  <dig> months of age, with an earlier embryonic stage included for the heart  . by qrt-pcr, sepn <dig> expression was detected in all tissues, albeit at barely detectable levels in liver . overall, variations in the mrna levels observed for the different tissues were limited. nevertheless, we observed a significant decrease in expression between e <dig> and e <dig> in the brain and in kidney. in parallel, increased levels were detected between e <dig> and postnatal day  <dig> in diaphragm, heart and kidney. lastly, we showed a two fold increase in expression in the brain, between young  and adult mice  and a two fold reduction in kidney, between the first week of life and older mice  . interestingly, expression in quadriceps and diaphragm did not exhibit the highest levels and appeared mostly constant. similar results were obtained for skeletal muscles isolated from posterior  and anterior  hind limb compartments .

we studied the expression of seln at the protein level by western blot, using proteins extracted from isolated tissues from e <dig> to  <dig> months of age. several proteins were tested for protein loading control; actin and gapdh exhibited the least variability between the various developmental stages . nevertheless, quadriceps homogenates displayed an increase of both actin and gapdh expressions after  <dig> days of age; for this tissue, no ideal protein normalization could be obtained. for all the tissues considered except liver, we observed a striking reduction in seln expression between e <dig> and postnatal day  <dig> , and even more so at adult ages when it became barely detectable  . in protein extracts from liver, seln was never detected, even at e <dig> , in keeping with the transcript quantifications.

in parallel, using mouse c2c <dig> muscle cells, we observed a 50% decrease of sepn <dig> expression in myotubes after  <dig> and  <dig> days of differentiation, compared to myoblasts . this reduction was even more marked at the protein level with a five fold reduction detected in myotubes compared to myoblasts by western blot . this is in accordance with data previously obtained with human cells  <cit> .

specificity of sepn <dig> probes
since no appropriate antibody was available for immunohistochemistry, we investigated sepn <dig> expression pattern during early embryogenesis by whole mount in situ hybridization . the murine sepn <dig> cdna ,  <dig> bp in size, contains  <dig> exons, the in-frame uga codon being located in exon  <dig>  and leads to a protein of  <dig> residues . in mouse, no sequence homology was found with the alternatively spliced third exon described in human, since this exon corresponds to a primate specific alu sequence  <cit> . two sepn <dig> probes  were synthesized from pcr fragments corresponding to the 3' region of the cdna . the corresponding murine transcript regions shared more than 85% identity with the human sequence. we performed northern blot analysis with pr <dig> and pr <dig> probes, using rna extracted from cultured human fibroblasts from a control subject and a rsmd <dig> patient with sepn <dig> mrna degradation due to a premature termination codon . for both probes, one band corresponding to sepn <dig> transcripts was observed in control rna, but was undetectable in rna extracted from the patient, thus validating the specificity of the probes . using mouse rna extracted from e <dig> and e <dig> whole embryos, we detected only one  <dig>  kb band by northern blot, which corresponds to the predicted transcript size for sepn <dig> .

expression pattern of sepn <dig> during embryogenesis
sepn <dig> deficient mouse embryos were used as negative controls for whole mount ish. the recombinant gene construct introduced a frame-shift and a premature stop codon within the coding sequence, leading to a loss of the functional protein in mutants . as shown in figure 5a, sepn <dig> expression was barely detectable at the transcript levels in e <dig>  mutant whole embryos  compared to wild-type , indicative of the sepn <dig> mrna degradation in the model. at the protein level, seln was observed in wild-type embryos by western blot but was undetectable in mutant samples .

identical expression patterns were obtained with pr <dig> and pr2; results presented in figure  <dig> correspond to ish performed with the pr <dig> probe. at the different embryonic stages tested, no signal could be detected using either sense probes with wild-type embryos  or antisense probes with sepn1-/- embryos . this confirmed the specificity of the staining pattern obtained.

in e <dig>  whole embryos, we detected sepn <dig> expression in somites and the neural tube, as well as in the mesenchyme located under the ectoderm, in the head and the branchial arches of embryos . at e <dig> , a ubiquitous-like staining was observed in whole embryos, with a stronger expression in somites . upon vibratome sectioning, the staining was associated with expression in the sub-ectodermal mesenchyme, as depicted in forebrain . at e <dig>  and e <dig> , whole embryos appeared strongly stained in the dorsal part of the body, the limb buds, the branchial arches and the head . following sectioning, we observed expression in the dorsal root ganglia . furthermore, within the somites, the myotome appeared strongly stained, whereas little to no signal was detected in the dermomyotome of embryos . moreover, as previously seen, the mesenchyme located under the ectoderm exhibited staining, particularly in the head and limb buds , although this signal was weak and required a longer revelation time as compared to the staining observed in the myotome and drg.

interestingly, at all of these stages, we did not observe staining in the heart by ish, whereas sepn <dig> expression was detected as early as e <dig> in this tissue by qrt-pcr. this could result either from sepn <dig> cardiac expression appearing after e <dig> , or more likely from the higher sensitivity of the qpcr technique.

somitogenesis in sepn <dig> deficient murine embryos
since an early expression of sepn <dig> was observed in somites and defects were reported in somite organisation and myogenic factors expression in sepn <dig> morpholino injected zebrafish embryos  <cit> , we specifically investigated these events in sepn1-/- embryos. at mid-gestation stages , ish performed against the myogenic determination factors myf <dig>  myod, and pax <dig> revealed no defect in somite size and organisation in sepn1-/- embryos compared to wild-type . moreover, the expression pattern of these factors was similar in both types of embryos . likewise, the expression of myosin heavy chain, a marker of differentiated muscle cells, was unaltered when visualized by immunohistochemistry in e <dig>  and e <dig> deficient embryos . these data were confirmed by qrt-pcr and western blot analyses that demonstrated no modification of the myogenic factors expression in the deficient embryos . lastly, the expression patterns of scleraxis, involved in the establishment of myotendinous junctions  <cit> , and of trka, a neurotrophin receptor which was used as a marker of the drg  <cit> , appeared unmodified in sepn1-/- embryos by whole-mount ish .

discussion
in this study, we characterized for the first time the precise spatio-temporal expression pattern of the murine sepn <dig> gene, the homolog of sepn <dig> involved in several forms of early onset myopathies in humans. we showed that sepn <dig> is expressed early during embryogenesis and strongly down-regulated before birth. we also demonstrated that, in most isolated tissues, sepn <dig> expression exhibited limited variations at the transcript levels between pre- and post-natal stages, but significant changes at the protein levels were detected, thereby pointing to a major post-transcriptional regulation of this gene. of particular interest are some specific tissues where a significant increase in the expression of transcript was observed between e <dig> and postnatal day  <dig>  or older mice , whereas an almost 80% decrease in the protein levels was detected between equivalent stages. despite the lack of data concerning the developmental expression pattern of sec insertion factors, one regulatory mechanism, inherent to selenoproteins, may be based on the availability of these specific factors. indeed, this complex machinery may exhibit spatial and temporal regulation, associated with a hierarchy in the synthesis of selenoproteins, leading to potential fine tuning of each selenoprotein in both physiological and selenium deprivation conditions  <cit> . it is thus conceivable that seln expression is modulated depending on its requirements and biological roles in each tissue at the various developmental stages. notably, we reported recently that the loss of interaction between the secis sequence and sbp <dig> abolished seln translation and also led to the degradation of sepn <dig> mrna  <cit> . therefore, modifying the interaction with the translational machinery may also affect sepn <dig> transcript stability in mouse. hence, whether the regulation of seln during development depends on the availability of sec insertion factors remains questionable.

another regulatory pathway could involve micrornas, recently reported as major factors for translation modulation without mrna expression perturbation  <cit> . their importance in several developmental mechanisms has already been well established in most species, including vertebrates  <cit> . we determined that the sepn <dig> sequence is a potential target for several micrornas ; however, their biological relevance and developmental involvement are not yet established. on the other hand, seln expression may also be modulated by protein degradation or cleavage, as reported for different proteins located within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane  <cit> . such proteolysis was suggested in the study of deniziak et al. who observed a potential cleavage product by western blot that correlates with reduced expression of seln in zebrafish  <cit> . however, it was not investigated whether the degradation was physiological, or rather linked to the experimental conditions. lastly, it is noteworthy that in some tissues, such as kidney and liver, in which similar dynamics were observed for protein and transcript expression, the gene is most likely regulated at the transcriptional level, although the factors involved are not known yet. taken together, our findings reveal that complex transcriptional and translational regulation networks may be associated with the expression of seln during development.

the expression pattern presented herein provides interesting insights into the physiological functions of seln. indeed, in all of the tissues examined except liver, high levels of seln expression were limited to a particular temporal window, with a pronounced and progressive reduction observed between e <dig> and post-natal stages. these results are consistent with those obtained in zebrafish where a strong reduction of the expression was detected during somites differentiation  <cit> , and in humans where a decrease was observed between foetal and adult tissues  <cit> . this developmental pattern suggests that seln may participate in the maturation of cells and organs from mid-gestation to perinatal stages. this notion is supported by the observation that seln expression decreased during both human  <cit>  and murine myoblast differentiation in culture. to our knowledge, there is no similar expression pattern reported for other selenoproteins but this may be at least partly due to the lack of studies focusing on the expression pattern of these proteins in mammals. notwithstanding, in mouse, selenoprotein w  was found to be expressed early during development  and to decrease during myoblast differentiation, but comparisons between pre- and post-natal stages in different tissues were not reported  <cit> . moreover, in zebrafish, selm was the only other selenoprotein reported to be expressed at the transcript levels in somites  <cit> .

based on the previous data obtained in humans and zebrafish, a potential link between seln and cell proliferation has already been proposed  <cit> . at mid-gestation stages, we found that sepn <dig> is expressed in the mesenchyme located under the ectoderm. taking into account our previous work showing high expression in fibroblasts  <cit> , we attributed this expression to mesenchymal cells that share the general features of fibroblasts. moreover, we first hypothesized that this pattern could correlate with a higher proportion of proliferative cells in this area. however, brdu staining in e <dig>  embryos did not reveal a higher mitotic activity in this region . likewise, in mature somites, sepn <dig> expression was detected in the myotome, mainly composed of post-mitotic cells that have initiated the myogenic program, while its expression was almost undetectable in the dermomyotome where most cells are proliferating  <cit> . therefore, at least during mouse embryogenesis, there is no straightforward correlation between sepn <dig> and cell proliferation.

the early expression detected in somites correlates with ish results obtained in zebrafish  <cit> . moreover, in mice, the restricted expression found in myotome indicates that sepn <dig> is expressed by muscle precursors and maturating myocytes but less or not by uncommitted cells. interestingly, in contrast to observations performed on zebrafish embryos knock-down for sepn <dig> expression  <cit> , we did not detect any defects in somite organisation nor in myogenic factors expression, at mid-gestation stages, in sepn <dig> mutant embryos. this suggests that seln is dispensable for somitogenesis as well as the early waves of myogenesis in mouse. the simplest explanation would be that redundant activities exist in mouse, which may be less active in others animals. due to the common reactivity of selenoproteins conferred by the sec residue, one can hypothesize that some functional redundancy may exist within the protein family. therefore, it would be interesting to further investigate other selenoproteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum, such as sep <dig>  sels and selm, and/or expressed predominantly during embryogenesis, like gpx <dig>  <cit> . in addition, among the selenoproteins expressed in skeletal muscles, selw is particularly interesting because of its dynamic expression during muscle maturation and its presumed association with white muscle disease  <cit> . quantification of several selenoproteins expression by qrt-pcr revealed no difference between e <dig>  wild-type and mutant sepn1-/- whole embryos . however, additional experiments, including older mice and protein analyses, need to be performed to resolve this issue.

lastly, the barely detectable levels of seln expression found in mature muscles fit with the previous observations in human tissues  <cit>  and suggest a limited role for the protein at these stages. this contrasts with the progressive evolution of the pathology with age. one reason may be that seln deficiency during muscle development leads to increased fragility of the tissue that worsens during aging. another non necessarily exclusive hypothesis is that seln is required in mature muscles subjected to constant tonic contractions, since the pathology affects more severely the respiratory and postural muscles. however, our data showing similar expression levels in muscles as different as quadriceps and diaphragm do not appear to sustain this hypothesis. the characterization of sepn <dig> deficient mice, from later developmental stages to adult ages, will constitute a major point of investigation in order to better understand seln function in muscle physiology and the remaining paradox regarding its almost ubiquitous expression and the specific muscular phenotypes.

taking into account the recent studies suggesting a role for seln in the regulation of ryanodine receptors  activity  <cit> , it is interesting to try and correlate their developmental activity with the expression pattern of seln described herein. ryr <dig> expression was reported in mouse myotome as early as e <dig>  by ish  <cit>  but significant protein expression was only detected at late embryonic stages in rodents  <cit> . in addition, ryr <dig> expression greatly increases two weeks after birth and becomes predominant in mature muscles, therefore differing from seln pattern  <cit> . in contrast, ryr <dig> expression strongly decreases at postnatal day  <dig> and it is almost undetectable in most adult tissues  <cit> . furthermore, it was reported that its expression is exclusively maintained in highly active muscles, such as diaphragm or neck muscles  <cit>  in which it may amplify calcium signals  <cit> . interestingly, these tissues correspond to the most affected muscles in sepn1-related myopathies. taken together, this comparison between ryr channels and seln weakens the proposed functional link between ryr <dig> and seln, but suggests a closer relationship between ryr <dig> and seln. this is further substantiated by our ish results. indeed, sepn <dig> staining was detected in the dorsal root ganglia which correspond to neural crest derivatives containing cell bodies of sensitive neurons, where a cicr mechanism was reported and associated with ryr <dig> channels  <cit> . we note also that sepn <dig> was expressed in the sub-ectodermal mesenchyme, a region known to dynamically participate in cell migration during development, with active calcium waves involved in this process. finally, the precise role of seln in the regulation of ryr channels and the existence of other substrates remain largely unsolved.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study that establishes the precise spatio-temporal expression pattern of selenoprotein n in mammals, with both transcript and protein analyses at the different developmental stages. we showed that seln is expressed early during mouse embryogenesis, particularly in somites and muscle precursors. nevertheless, it appears to be dispensable for correct somitogenesis and expression of myogenic factors at mid-gestation stages. we also demonstrated that seln expression pattern is wide-spread and is subject to post-transcriptional regulations which lead to the significant reduction of its protein expression levels during the perinatal period. our results suggest important functions for seln during the maturation of cells and organs. further investigations should focus on the particular developmental window when seln is strongly expressed, to determine the involvement of this selenoprotein in muscle physiology and to unveil the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to muscle alteration in sepn1-related myopathies.
