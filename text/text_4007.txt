BACKGROUND
transition metals perform vital roles in many chemical reactions essential for life. a recent bioinformatic approach suggests zn-, non-heme fe- and cu-proteins constitute 10% of bacterial and eukaryotic proteomes and 13% of archaeal proteomes  <cit> . the roles of these metals can be varied. in some oxidoreductases, for instance, iron and copper are exploited for their ability to accept or donate electrons, while in hemoglobin and hemocyanin, these metals are used for oxygen transport  <cit> . zinc, on the other hand, serves as an electrophile or lewis acid in many protein-catalyzed reactions. the activity of metalloproteins  is, consequently, strictly dependent on the presence of a metal and in most cases of a specific metal. ensuring proper metal allocation is therefore critical for survival.

it was initially assumed that free pools of metal ions were available within the cell, such that a nascent polypeptide would acquire its cofactor solely through the metal-affinity of the chelating ligands. as discussed in several recent reviews, this picture of metal metabolism was oversimplified  <cit> , as: i) the ions are chelated intracellularly by proteins and small molecule ligands, and ii) metal-binding ligands are not sufficiently selective to ensure that the proper cofactor is loaded. since the discovery of the first copper metallochaperone, atx <dig> <cit> , numerous protein factors involved in metallocenter biosynthesis have been characterized. the mechanisms by which the cell ensures the correct metal ions are loaded into metalloproteins are just beginning to be understood.

studies involving the maturation of ni-urease and ni-fe hydrogenase have provided the most extensive picture of metallocenter biosynthesis . these two nickel-containing proteins require a suite of accessory proteins to properly insert ni into the catalytic site . in both cases, a gtpase  is involved in the incorporation of the ni cofactor. these two proteins belong to the g3e family of p-loop gtpases as defined by leipe and colleagues  <cit> . other members of this family include meab , required for the activation of methylmalonyl-coa mutase   <cit> , and cog <dig>  a large and diverse subfamily of proteins with poorly defined functions.

cog <dig> proteins occur in all kingdoms of life, and most sequenced genomes encode one or more homologs. the first member of the cog <dig> family was identified as being involved in cobalamin biosynthesis in pseudomonas denitrificans and hence named cobw  <cit> . other members of cog <dig> include the nitrile hydratase activator, which is required for fe-type nitrile hydratase activity  <cit> , and ycic of bacillus subtilis. due to repression by zur, a zinc-responsive transcription factor, ycic was originally assumed to code for a low-affinity zinc transporter  <cit> . without the means to automatically distinguish between these different functions, these annotations have been propagated amongst all members of the family in sequenced genomes. therefore, as a result of these studies, genes encoding a cog <dig> protein have been automatically and arbitrarily assigned either a function in cobalamin biosynthesis, in the activation of nitrile hydratase, or as a low-affinity zinc transporter. nevertheless, we note that each of these functions is related in the general sense to intracellular metal delivery. the diversity of the metals putatively handled by cog <dig>  ni, fe, or zn, suggests that there might be different sub-groups identifiable within the cog <dig> superfamily.

the cog <dig> family is a striking example of systematic, homology-based mis-annotation. although members are frequently annotated as having specific functions, these 'functions' are based only on homology to a few family members and are therefore suspect. the simplest way to annotate a genome is based on sequence homology to characterized genes. sequence homology does not necessarily equate to functional identity or even similarity. therefore, this approach to annotation is frequently inadequate as exemplified in the literature  <cit>  and illustrated by the development of alternative paradigms for functional annotation  <cit> .

to provide an improved annotation for the various members of this family and gain insight into the role members of this protein family may perform, we conducted an extensive comparative genomic analysis of the g3e family of p-loop gtpases and more specifically of cog <dig> members. by combining phylogenetic analysis, physical clustering analysis, and regulatory site detection, we predict that the cog <dig> family comprises subfamilies that have specialized and distinct functions in metal metabolism. we also hypothesize that several, but not all, of these subfamilies have a role in survival under conditions of poor zinc nutrition in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms.

RESULTS
phylogenomic analysis of cog <dig> proteins as members of the g3e family of p-loop gtpases
phylogenetic analysis first performed by leipe, et al.  <cit>  and repeated here with a diverse set of family members  shows that cog <dig> belongs to the g3e family of p-loop gtpases , which is separated from the rest of the simibi class of gtpases  by a glutamate residue in the walker b motif and an intact nkxd motif   <cit> . characterized members of the g3e family perform two roles in metallocenter assembly: 1) facilitating incorporation of the cofactor in an energy- dependent manner into the target protein's catalytic site  and, 2) storage and delivery of a metal cofactor to a target metalloprotein . g3e family proteins have been found to function as either metal-insertases or as a dual function metallochaperone/insertase. for example, meab appears to fulfill the role of an adenosylcobalamin -insertase, facilitating the insertion of b <dig> into methylmalonyl-coa mutase   <cit> . a large structural rearrangement occurs upon interaction between meab and its target  <cit> , suggesting that meab may be responsible for the structural changes that must occur for b <dig> cofactor incorporation. in addition, meab also appears to protect radical intermediates that are essential for the activity of mcm  <cit> . in hydrogenase maturation, hypb is thought to carry out both the insertase and metallochaperone roles in most organisms due to the presence of a histidine stretch located at the n-terminus of these proteins. in bradyrhizobium japonicum, this histidine stretch was found to bind 18-ni ions per dimer  <cit> . in escherichia coli, the common histidine stretch is missing and slyd is presumed to be the metallochaperone component that delivers ni to the assembly complex  <cit> . most ureg proteins studied to date lack the histidine stretch that is found in most hypb proteins. accordingly, in urease maturation, ureg appears to function as an insertase and another accessory protein, uree, functions as the metallochaperone, delivering ni to the maturation complex  <cit> .

to support the proposition that the presence of a histidine stretch in g3e family proteins could be indicative of metallochaperone activity, we analyzed the distribution of genes encoding ureg and uree . we found that several genomes containing ureg homologs lack any recognizable uree homologs. in all but two of those genomes, ureg contains an added histidine-rich motif at the n- or c-terminus . as has been suggested for the ureg of mycobacterium tuberculosis, this his-stretch may be able to compensate for the absence of uree  <cit> . in addition, the absence of uree does not correlate with the presence of slyd as would be expected if slyd performs the metallochaperone role in those organisms. bradyrhizobium japonicum usda  <dig> and frankia sp. ccl <dig> are two exceptions to this trend as they lack both uree and a his-stretch extension in ureg. in these cases, the ni-metallochaperone involved in urease maturation could be hypb, which is present in both of these organisms . indeed, it has been shown in helicobacter pylori that hypb is required for activity of both hydrogenase and urease  <cit> , and a physical interaction between ureg and hypb has been verified  <cit> . although uree is present in the genome of h. pylori, the corresponding protein lacks a his-stretch. as expected, the addition of a his-stretch to uree was found to eliminate the need for hypb in the maturation of urease  <cit> .

we compared the amino acid sequence of  <dig> cog <dig> proteins from all kingdoms . we observed that like ureg and hypb orthologs, cog <dig> proteins are found with and without his-stretches, suggesting a distribution of insertase and metallochaperone activity among various members. approximately 40% of the sequences analyzed contain a histidine-rich region, commonly found near the c-terminus ;  <dig> cog <dig> proteins contain the minimal hxhxhxh motif, where x represents  <dig> -  <dig> residues. some proteins contain a his-stretch with up to  <dig> histidines, such as ava_ <dig>  from anabaena variabilis.

the region of highest similarity between cog <dig> and the other members of the g3e family is the gtpase domain, defined by the canonical walker a and walker b motifs   <cit> . gtpase activity of hypb and ureg has been shown to be essential for the metallocenter biosynthesis of hydrogenase and urease, respectively  <cit> , and postulated to be responsible for incorporation of b <dig> in mcm by meab  <cit> . gtpase activity has been verified for yjia, a cog <dig> homolog from escherichia coli, for which the crystal structure was solved  <cit> . in addition to the gtpase domain, all members of cog <dig> have a conserved, putative, metal-binding cxcc motif . analysis of the yjia crystal structure reveals this motif is found in the switch i region of the protein, suggesting that binding of gtp/gdp affects its conformation  <cit> . the same motif was found to be essential for the activity of the nitrile hydratase activator protein, a member of cog <dig> assumed to be involved in the incorporation of iron into fe-type nitrile hydratase  <cit> .

in addition to the gtpase domain, meab and most cog <dig> proteins contain an additional c-terminal domain. on average, cog <dig> is  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids larger than hypb and ureg, respectively, and only  <dig> residues larger than meab. the smallest g3e protein, ureg, is the gtpase component of a complex composed of ured and uref, where the three proteins act together in the activation of urease  <cit> . activation of mcm appears to only require delivery of the cofactor by adenosyltransferase and the activity of meab <cit> . the size of g3e proteins could be indicative of the number of other accessory proteins required for activation of the target metalloprotein.

while the n-terminal gtpase domain is well conserved among cog <dig> members, the c-terminal region is highly variable . indeed, cog <dig> proteins fall under the category of "segmentally variable genes ," as defined by zheng et al  <cit> . svg profiles for four members of the family  can be found at . svgs are genes that code for proteins that have highly variable regions interspersed with well-conserved regions. the authors observed that svgs encode proteins that are involved in adaptation to environmental stresses and proposed that highly variable domains are an indication of protein-protein interaction specificity or specificity of small molecule binding.

finally, as summarized in figure  <dig>  while hypb genes are consistently found in hydrogenase maturation gene clusters, ureg genes in the urease maturation clusters and meab genes cluster with mcm-encoding genes, cog <dig> genes are found in multiple gene clusters. most genomes contain only one homolog of hypb, ureg, or meab. conversely, up to  <dig> cog <dig> genes can be found in a single genome, as seen in cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig>  in addition, the available functional analyses of cog <dig> members suggest varied functions and an interaction with various metals  <cit> . we predict that the different gene clusters involving cog <dig> represent distinct subgroups. in contrast to the hypb, ureg, and meab subfamilies, which are composed of chaperones for a single protein, each cog <dig> subgroup may perform a chaperone role in different metallocenter biosynthesis of various proteins.

in summary, this analysis suggests that like hypb or ureg, cog <dig> proteins are most certainly metal insertase and/or metallochaperones. however, the metal substrate and the metalloprotein target of most cog <dig> family proteins is not obvious, and the initial analysis of the cog <dig> gene neighborhoods suggests that there could be a greater diversity of targets than observed for the other g3e family subgroups. to investigate the presence of diverse cog <dig> subfamilies, we combined literature analysis  with predictions of zur and b <dig> regulation  and phylogenetic and gene neighborhood analyses. this approach led to the identification of fifteen subfamilies . each subfamily is monophyletic and the corresponding genes belong to similar genomic neighborhoods and/or share conserved regulatory sites. two exceptions are subfamilies  <dig>  and  <dig> , which appear to be paraphyletic; the clade composed of subfamily  <dig> also contains subfamily  <dig> and the clade that contains subfamily  <dig> also contains subfamily  <dig> . five subfamilies  are analyzed in more detail below. the  <dig> others are detailed in additional file  <dig> 

the cobw subfamily involved in cobalamin biosynthesis
cobw was the first member of cog <dig> to be described and so-named because the disruption of the corresponding gene in pseudomonas denitrificans resulted in the inability to synthesize cobalamin   <cit> . although "cobalamin biosynthesis protein" is the most highly propagated annotation for cog <dig> members, our comparative genomic and phylogenetic analysis reveals that true cobw proteins  represent only  <dig> % of the cog <dig> family . in our previous genomic analysis, cobw genes were identified in proteobacteria located within the cobalamin biosynthesis gene clusters under control of the b <dig> riboswitch, a regulatory rna element modulating gene expression in response to changing b <dig> concentrations  <cit> . as many more genome sequences have become available, we updated this analysis and report that  <dig> out of  <dig> cobw orthologs analyzed belong to b12-regulated gene clusters in γ-, β-, and α-proteobacteria . in three α-proteobacteria from the rhodospirillaceae family, cobw genes belong to the cobalamin biosynthesis gene clusters that are not preceded by b <dig> riboswitches. finally, cobw orthologs in cyanobacteria are neither clustered with b <dig> biosynthesis genes nor regulated by a b <dig> riboswitch. however, these orthologs are highly similar to other cobw proteins and the corresponding genes co-occur with the cobalamin biosynthesis genes of the aerobic pathway.

in the majority of cases, cobw is found adjacent to the cobalt chelatase component, cobn  and all cobw proteins analyzed contain a his-stretch, which on average is composed of  <dig> histidines . the exact function of cobw is still not clear; it could be involved in the presentation of the cobalt ion to the cobalt chelatase, protection of the cofactor, or involved in inserting a metal in a metal-dependent enzyme of the pathway, such as fe-dependent cobg  <cit> .

the nitrile hydratase activator subfamily
based on our analysis, less then  <dig> % of the cog <dig> family is represented by the nitrile hydratase  activators . a complete list of identified fe-type nhase activators from both genbank and seed databases is given in additional file  <dig>  in the literature, these proteins are referred to as nha <dig>  p44k, or p47k, depending on the organism in which the protein was identified . here we refer to this subgroup of cog <dig> as nha <dig>  nha <dig> is found clustered exclusively with the genes encoding the two subunits of the fe-type nhase  and has been found to be required for the in vivo activity of fe-type nhase  <cit> . nhases are enzymes that use either a non-heme iron  or non-corrin cobalt  for the hydration of nitriles to amides  <cit> . nhase types can be differentiated by the strictly conserved metal binding motifs cslcsct for fe and ctlcscy for co  <cit> . although, the same coordination geometry has been determined for both co- and fe-binding sites  <cit> , the two types of nhases specifically incorporate the correct metal. this specificity is thought to be due to activator proteins, which are required for full activity of their respective nhase. for co-type nhases, metallocenter biosynthesis is thought to occur via subunit exchange, a mechanism called "self-subunit swapping"  <cit> . the accessory protein in this case, nhle, is a self-subunit swapping chaperone and the corresponding gene is always found adjacent with the target nhase genes . no sequence similarity is found between the co-type accessory protein and the fe-type accessory protein supporting the conclusion that co- and fe-type metallocenters are assembled by different mechanisms.

even if the involvement of nha <dig> in fe-type nhase activation is documented, its exact role is not known. it has been postulated that it has an insertase role involved in incorporation of iron into the active site of the hydratase  <cit> . when the fe-dependent nhase from rhodococcus sp. n- <dig> was expressed in e. coli without nha <dig> in co-supplemented media, it incorporated co instead of fe  <cit> . therefore, nitrile hydratase activator proteins may not only be involved in incorporating fe, but also in ensuring that competing metal ions are excluded. in addition, the coexpression of nha <dig> with nhase was found to be unnecessary with the coexpression of the groesl chaperones  <cit> . this observation supports the hypothesis that cog <dig> proteins like the rest of the g3e family could be involved in the structural rearrangements that must take place to ensure the metal cofactor is incorporated into the catalytic site.

zur-regulated cog <dig> proteins
extensive analysis of the literature  reveals that members of cog <dig> have been implicated in the virulence of several pathogens whose hosts are known to induce zn-limitation as a defense strategy. in  <dig>  kochan introduced the concept of nutritional immunity as a defense strategy against invading pathogens  <cit> . the host organism actively deprives metals from the invaders inducing both hypoferremia and hypozincemia  as part of the acute inflammatory response  <cit> . therefore, the mechanisms that enable a pathogen to overcome this host-induced zn-starvation are considered essential to a pathogen's ability to cause infection  <cit> . in mycobacterium tuberculosis, a cog0523-like gene, rv <dig>   is up-regulated during human macrophage infection  <cit>  . in the closely related mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, this gene is found on a pathogenicity island  <cit>  and the corresponding protein was the second strongest antigen consistently reactive with cattle sera infected with m. avium or micobacterium bovis  <cit> . cog <dig> is also found in a pathogenicity island from enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . the loss of cog <dig> in brucella suis rendered this bacterium incapable of intramacrophagic replication  <cit> , while the loss of cog <dig> in burkholderia pseudomallei results in the inability to infect caenorhabditis elegans   <cit> . an ortholog from francisella tularensis was expressed exclusively in bacteria separated from infected murine spleen tissue  <cit> . this gene is down-regulated in the francisella novicida Δpmra mutant  <cit> . pmra is a transcription factor found to be essential for survival/growth inside human and murine macrophage cell lines  <cit> .

in plants, an opposing defense strategy may be employed, as repression of zinc uptake machinery is required for full virulence of the plant pathogens, xanthomonas campestris and xanthomonas oryzae  <cit> . in contrast to animal pathogens and further supporting a role for cog <dig> in zinc homeostasis, two cog <dig> homologs of agrobacterium tumefaciens as well as the genes encoding the high-affinity zinc transporter, znuabc, are down-regulated in response to plant signals   <cit> .

the most extensive analysis of the zinc-dependent regulation of a cog <dig> gene has been performed on the cog <dig>  in bacillus subtilis encoding a member of subfamily  <dig> . the expression of ycic is controlled by the zn-dependent zur repressor and is thus up-regulated under zn-limiting conditions  <cit> . in addition to the work on ycic, an early comparative genomic analysis had identified zur-regulated ycic orthologs in several gram-positive bacteria   <cit> . as this initial analysis of putative zur-binding sites had been done when a limited set of genomes was available and, as discussed above, scattered observation links this family to zinc limitation, we expanded the analysis to all currently complete bacterial genomes .

sixty-eight ycic/cog <dig> genes were found to be downstream of a potential zur-binding site mainly in firmicutes and γ-, β-, and α-proteobacteria . two cog <dig> genes were found downstream of a putative zur site in the cyanobacteria, prochlorococcus marinus, nostoc sp. pcc  <dig> and several cyanothece species . while most proteins encoded by zur-regulated cog <dig> members are found in subfamily  <dig> , several paralogs are found in other subfamilies. for instance, in pseudomonas entomophila, pseudomonas fluorescens, and pseudomonas putida there are two cog <dig> homologs per genome predicted to be downstream of a zur-binding site . our phylogenetic analysis reveals that one paralog belongs to subfamily  <dig> while the other belongs to subfamily  <dig> . zur-regulated cog <dig> paralogs are also found in subfamily  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . one possibility is that the presence of several zur-regulated cog <dig> subfamilies could be indicative of more than one function of cog <dig> under zinc limitation .

of the three cog <dig> genes in acinetobacter baylyi adp <dig>  only one is regulated by zur
to test the predictive power of our cog <dig> phylogenomic analysis, the regulation of the three cog <dig> genes from acinetobacter baylyi adp <dig> was analyzed. the first, aciad <dig> , is predicted to be a nha <dig> homolog . the second, aciad <dig> , is predicted to be most similar to subfamilies  <dig> and  <dig>  the third, aciad <dig> , is predicted to be regulated by zur . these groupings suggest that the expression of only the aciad1741-encoding gene should be under zur control. expression of the three a. baylyi cog <dig> genes was analyzed by rt-pcr  in a wt strain and in a Δzur derivative . as shown in figure  <dig>  the presence or absence of zur does not affect the expression of aciad <dig> and aciad <dig> under the conditions tested. nevertheless, as we predicted, aciad <dig> is only expressed in Δzur background.

identification of putative zur-regulated genes encoding paralogs of zn-dependent enzymes
genome context analysis revealed that a significant proportion of the ycic genes  are located within chromosomal gene clusters including genes for zinc transport , the zur repressor, and various genes encoding paralogs of zinc-dependent proteins . nine families of zn-dependent enzymes whose paralogs belong to zur regulons in γ-, and β-proteobacteria  were found. these zn-dependent enzymes include phosphoribosyl-amp cyclohydrolase , dihydroorotase , γ-class carbonic anhydrase , porphobilinogen synthase , cysteinyl-trna synthetase , threonyl-trna synthetase , n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, queuosine biosynthesis enzyme qued, and c4-type zinc finger regulator dksa .

differential regulation of distinct isofunctional genes by co-factor availability is a known regulatory mechanism in bacteria  and in eukaryotes . for instance, the coenzyme b12-independent isozymes of methionine synthase and ribonucleotide reductase are regulated by b <dig> riboswitches in the genomes that encode both b12-dependent and -independent isozymes  <cit> . likewise, a similar regulatory strategy has been described for zinc availability. zn-independent proteins are negatively regulated by zur and expressed under zn-limiting conditions to replace the zn-dependent proteins. examples include paralogs of ribosomal proteins  <cit>  and alternative isozymes of gtp cyclohydrolase i   <cit> . in both cases, a zn-dependent protein is functionally replaced by a zn-independent counterpart during conditions of zinc deficiency.

our comparative analysis of zur regulons revealed co-regulation and frequent co-localization on the chromosome between cog <dig> and paralogs of these zn-dependent enzymes. for example, cupriavidus metallidurans has a zur-regulated gene cluster encoding ycic, fole <dig>  and paralogs of cyss, qued, cam, and pyrc, whereas the zur regulon in pseudomonas fluorescens includes two cog <dig> proteins, fole <dig>  and paralogs of amia, dksa, hisi, cam, and pyrc .

we hypothesize that these alternative enzymes could require a metal other than zn  and are therefore expressed during zn-limitation to replace or compensate for the decreased activity of their zn-dependent counterparts. indeed, the carbonic anhydrases found in our analysis are members of the γ-class. the γ-class carbonic anhydrase from methanosarcina thermophila exhibited highest activity with fe and, when purified under anaerobic conditions, contained fe and not zn  <cit> . the zur-regulated cam we have identified could therefore encode an fe-dependent carbonic anhydrase expressed to compensate for the zn-dependent carbonic anhydrases.

the proteins of three other families downstream of putative zur binding sites are missing the conserved zinc binding residues. as shown in figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  some genomes encode three pyrc paralogs. one paralog is similar to the dihydroorotase from escherichia coli. these proteins have a binuclear zinc center chelated by the conserved metal binding residues his  <dig>  his  <dig>  lys  <dig>  asp  <dig>  his  <dig> and his  <dig>  <cit> . the second pyrc paralog is an inactive dihydroorotase, which is referred to in the literature as pyrc'  <cit> . similar to pyrc', the zinc-binding residues are not conserved in the pyrc paralog whose gene we predict to be regulated by zur. however, unlike pyrc', this pyrc paralog has previously been shown to display dihydroorotase activity  <cit> . for porphobilinogen synthase, the existence of zinc binding and non-zinc binding variants is documented in the literature  <cit> . as expected, hemb <dig> contains the zinc chelating cysteine ligands while those cysteines are not conserved in the protein, hemb <dig>  encoded by the gene putatively regulated by zur in pseudomonas putida . hemb <dig> we would accordingly expect to be active with magnesium and/or potassium instead of zinc. in addition, the dksa paralogs downstream of putative zur binding sites are missing the canonical c4-zinc finger motifs .

not all paralogs seem to have lost their zinc-binding sites as the zinc-binding residues are conserved in the hisi, cysrs, thrrs, qued, and amia paralogs encoded by genes predicted to be induced during zinc depletion. an alternative explanation for the existence of these paralogs could be to increase protein copy number during zinc deficiency. the analysis of the metal content of some paralogs identified in this study is currently underway.

cog <dig> in eukaryotes: two chlamydomonas reinhardtii cog <dig> homologs are induced under zinc limitation
cog <dig> is widespread in eukaryotes, with most organisms containing one to four homologs , and have been associated with stress phenotypes . in arabidopsis thaliana, one of the three cog <dig> genes , which was isolated as a member of the actively-transcribed plastid chromosome in mustard seed  <cit> , is induced under heat-stress  <cit> . deletion of cog <dig> from saccharomyces cerevisiae, ynr029c , confers sensitivity to the metal chelator, glycol-bis -n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid   <cit>  as well as salt-sensitive and heat-sensitive phenotypes  <cit>  .

gene clustering is not very informative in eukaryotes but most eukaryotic cog <dig> homologs including homo sapiens belong to subfamily  <dig> . the prokaryotic members of subfamily  <dig> cluster on the genome with genes that encode wd40-repeat proteins, which form a β-propeller structure thought to mediate protein-protein interactions  <cit> , and with znuabc and creatinase encoding genes . several prokaryotic members of subfamily  <dig> are also predicted to be downstream of a zur-binding site , suggesting a role for bacterial members of subfamily  <dig> in the response to zinc limitation.

little if any work has been performed on the role of cog <dig> in eukaryotes, which do not encode a zur homolog. therefore, we sought to investigate the regulation of cog <dig> during metal depletion in a eukaryotic reference organism. previous studies have established the alga chlamydomonas reinhardtii as a choice reference organism for the study of trace metal homeostasis because it is straightforward to deplete the medium of zinc, copper, iron or manganese . sentinel genes for each of these deficiencies are known, such as cyc <dig> for copper deficiency, fox <dig> for iron-deficiency, nramp <dig> for manganese deficiency and zrt <dig> for zn-deficiency  <cit> . furthermore, chlamydomonas has retained many pathways present in the common ancestor to the plant and animal lineages and displays the metabolic flexibility of "back up" or alternate systems  <cit> . for instance, the replacement of b12-independent methionine synthase with a b12-dependent form when this cofactor is available, the use of mn-dependent superoxide dismutase  in place of fe-sod in iron-limitation and the replacement of plastocyanin with cytochrome c <dig> in copper-deficiency  <cit> .

we identified  <dig> genes encoding proteins with cog <dig> domains in versions  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the c. reinhardtii draft genome  <cit>  . of these  <dig> gene models, only  <dig> gene models encoded full-length cog <dig> gtpase domains. therefore, we tested the expression of these  <dig> genes as a function of zn, cu, fe and mn nutrition. transcripts for two of these, encoding proteins  <dig> and  <dig> , are increased in abundance by several orders of magnitude when cells are grown in zinc-limiting conditions as opposed to zinc-replete conditions, only slightly induced under copper limitation relative to copper-replete conditions and unaffected by iron or manganese nutrition . the zinc sensors and regulatory factors responsible for mediating this response to zinc depletion are yet unknown in c. reinhardtii.

our phylogenetic analysis reveals that protein  <dig> belongs to subfamily  <dig>  while protein  <dig> belongs to subfamily  <dig> . we therefore substantiate the role of cog <dig> family members in zn homeostasis in eukaryotes as well as in bacteria. several cog <dig> proteins encoded by eukaryotic genomes belong to subfamily  <dig> . we predict that the expression of some of these other eukaryotic cog <dig> proteins may also be regulated by zinc.

in addition, supporting the functional diversity revealed by our gene neighborhood analysis, the expression of the eight other cog <dig> family members from c. reinhardtii are not significantly affected by the deficiency of metals tested.

cog <dig> in archaea
although cog <dig> was previously assumed to be missing from archaea  <cit> , the availability of recently sequenced genomes reveals that out of  <dig> archaeal genomes in the seed database, eight genomes contain at least one cog <dig> homolog, with methanosarcina acetivorans c2a containing eight homologs. most archaeal members belong to subfamily  <dig>  members of which co-localize with corrinoid-dependent methyltransferases . in methanosarcina barkeri, methanosarcina acetivorans, methanosarcina mazei, and methanococcus maripaludis s <dig>  cog <dig> clusters with genes involved in methanol:com methylation: mtaa, mtab, , mtac  and ramm  . clustering between cog <dig> and methanogenesis genes is not limited to archaea but also found in clostridium botulinum . another clostridium, desulfitobacterium hafniense dcb- <dig>  encodes a cog <dig> that clusters with a metr homolog  . also, proteome analysis of acetate- and methanol-grown m. acetivoran scells revealed the presence of ma <dig>  in methanol-grown cells  <cit> . finally, mm <dig>  is induced to the same extent as its neighboring ramm homolog, mm <dig>  during growth in high salt conditions   <cit> .

archaeal genomes sequenced to date lack any recognizable homolog of the fur  or zur  transcriptional regulators. alternatively, there is a large group of mntr/dtxr-like regulators in archaea  that regulate iron homeostasis, whereas another small group of mntr/dtxr-like repressors in methanosarcina spp. named zntr , is predicted to regulate the zinc uptake operon, znuabc . comparative genomic analysis of this novel zinc regulon in m. acetivorans reveals that a cog <dig> homolog, ma <dig>  is co-regulated with znuabc based on the presence of candidate-binding sites of the zntr repressor .

CONCLUSIONS
cog <dig> is a diverse family of metal chaperones
based on relatedness to the g3e family of gtpases, we expect cog <dig> to also be involved in metallocenter biosynthesis of target metalloproteins. the diversity of genomic co-localization suggests that cog <dig> is more diverse than the other subfamilies of g3e. both the metal specificity and the protein target might vary from one subgroup to another.

while the known roles in cobalamin biosynthesis and response to zinc limitation predominate, our analysis implies members of cog <dig> are not limited to those roles. based on genome context  and protein similarity analyses, only  <dig> % of sequenced cog <dig> from the seed are true cobw proteins and assigned to the cobalamin biosynthesis pathway. only ~30% of cog <dig> members analyzed are linked to the zinc homeostasis either through putative zur sites  or co-localization with genes involved in the response to zinc starvation . in addition the third known role, nhase activator, only applies to less than 1% of sequenced cog <dig> genes. over half of cog <dig> may perform a role in the activity of unknown proteins.

a ubiquitous subset of cog <dig> is linked to zinc
although involvement in the response to zinc deficiency applies to only a subset of cog <dig>  we show that this function is not limited to bacteria but also present in archaea and eukaryota. two c. reinhardtii cog <dig> homologs, which belong to separate phylogenetic subgroups, are induced under zinc-deficient conditions compared to zinc-replete conditions. in addition, the expression of the eight other homologs was not significantly affected by metal deprivation confirming the diversity of cog <dig> 

identification of novel zinc homeostasis mechanisms
the comparative genomic analysis of the zinc repressor zur regulons in bacteria has revealed insights into previously unknown zinc homeostasis mechanisms. at least nine protein families that are homologs or isozymes of known zn-dependent proteins were identified as candidate members of the reconstructed zur regulons in γ- and β-proteobacteria, suggesting their up-regulation during zinc limitation. based on sequence analysis, four of these protein families do not contain the canonical zinc binding residues. we propose, therefore, that these paralogs may require a metal other than zn for catalysis and are involved in the adaptation to poor zinc nutrition. the presence of these paralogs could aid in compensating for the loss in activity of the zn-dependent protein analogs and reducing in the total amount of zn required by the cell.

putative roles of cog <dig> in response to zinc limitation
at this stage, if the exact role of cog <dig> members in survival in low zinc conditions is still to be determined, several hypotheses can be proposed. our comparative genomic analysis suggests that cog <dig> may be a metal chaperone for a protein that is also part of the zur regulon. the 'alternative enzymes' of zn-dependent proteins may require a metal other than zinc for catalysis and may also require a metal chaperone for efficient cofactor acquisition. however, in about half of the genomes analyzed, ycic  appears to not belong to any operon. for instance, although adjacent to fole <dig>  ycic is usually regulated by zur independently .

another possibility would be that cog <dig> is involved in the allocation and reallocation of zinc. zinc is not an essential cofactor for metabolic steps where zinc-independent back-up proteins can substitute. accordingly, in conditions of poor zinc nutrition, we expect that zinc delivery is prioritized to proteins that do not have zinc-independent substitutes . induction of the c. reinhardtii genes,  <dig> and  <dig>  containing the putative metal delivery cog <dig> domain, may affect prioritized delivery to a subset of zinc targets. these delivery factors might be particularly important in a compartmentalized eukaryotic cell. in bacteria, cog <dig> may also function as either a zinc chaperone as proposed recently by gabriel et al.  <cit>  or as a molecular chaperone that aids in the folding of essential zinc metalloproteins ensuring that essential zn-proteins acquire zinc while nonessential proteins are excluded .

as a third hypothesis, some members of cog <dig> may be a chaperone involved in incorporating a metal other than zinc into zn-dependent enzyme based on zinc availability. in vitro, the activity of several zn-dependent enzymes is slightly less, the same, or in some cases higher with a metal cofactor other than zinc . under zinc limitation and supplementation with cobalt, the zinc in carbonic anhydrase of the marine diatom, thalassiosira weissflogii, is substituted with cobalt in vivo  <cit> . the genome of the closely related thalassiosira pseudonana encodes seven cog <dig> proteins. interestingly, the genomes of cyanobacteria and algae tend to encode relatively high numbers of cog <dig> proteins. zinc-containing carbonic anhydrases are important for assimilation of co <dig>  and algae tend to express multiple isoforms in various organelles  <cit> , which might require mechanisms for preferential metal delivery. the symbiotic alga chlorella sp. nc64a has twelve homologs and the free-living chlorella vulgaris c- <dig> has seven. the genome of micromonas sp. rcc <dig> encodes ten cog <dig> homologs and the smallest known free-living eukaryote, ostreococcus tauri, has four homologs. as stated above, the cyanobacterium cyanothece sp. atcc  <dig> has eleven homologs, while anabaena variabilis has five and nostoc sp. pcc <dig> and prochlorococcus marinus susp. marinus both have four homologs. this high number of paralogs might reflect their particular lifestyles.

lastly, there is some evidence from magnetospirillum magneticum amb- <dig> that a meab homolog may function as a cytoplasmic atpase required for energizing fe uptake  <cit> . indeed, neither meab homolog encoded in the m. magneticum genome appears to be co-transcribed with a gene encoding methylmalonyl-coa mutase . therefore, a role for some cog <dig> members in affecting metal transport cannot be ruled out at this point.

further experimental work is now required to discriminate between these different potential roles. to complicate the problem, there are up to three zur-regulated cog <dig> paralogs in some genomes, therefore, a combination of the above functional hypotheses may prove to be operational.
