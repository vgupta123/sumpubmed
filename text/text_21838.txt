BACKGROUND
wheat is an important food crop that is grown worldwide and provides approximately 20% of the calories consumed by mankind  <cit> . in spite of its economic importance, the ability to modify and understand gene function in wheat is still not fully developed due to several limitations. the large size of the wheat genome   <cit>  and its high content of repetitive dna   <cit>  are important obstacles for the complete genome sequencing of wheat. in addition, wheat is a polyploid species with most genes represented by two  or three  homoeologous copies that share approximately 93–96% sequence identity. gene duplication limits the use of forward genetics phenotypic screens as the effect of single-gene knockouts are frequently masked by the functional redundancy of homoeologous genes present in the other wheat genomes  <cit> .

despite these barriers, a broad range of genomic resources have been developed for wheat. over one million expressed sequence tags  are deposited in genbank covering ~60% of the expressed genome  <cit> . multiple diploid, tetraploid, and hexaploid bacterial artificial chromosome  libraries  <cit>  have been constructed in wheat and colinearity has been established between wheat and the sequenced rice  <cit>  and brachypodium genomes  <cit> . these resources have facilitated the positional cloning of several agronomically important genes, but the functional validation of the candidate genes has relied mainly in transgenic approaches that are laborious, low throughput and require regulatory oversight. the recent assembly of the chromosome 3b physical map  <cit>  provides a feasible strategy for a chromosome-based approach for the future sequencing of wheat. the anchored contigs of chromosome 3b will provide the initial template for the sequencing of this chromosome generating an unprecedented amount of sequence information in wheat.

the ability to determine the function of these and other genes will ultimately depend on the establishment of robust, flexible and high-throughput reverse genetic tools. reverse genetic approaches use sequence information to identify candidate genes and then study the phenotype of the mutant alleles to determine gene function. several techniques are currently used for this purpose. t-dna or transposon insertional mutagenesis has been used successfully in rice and arabidopsis to assemble large gene knockout collections  <cit> , but has not been extended to wheat. rna interference is also a valuable technique in wheat since multiple homoeologues can be simultaneously down-regulated , but it is a time-consuming procedure that must be designed specifically for the genes of interest. in addition, both techniques are based on transgenic transformation which is limited to few varieties in wheat, is subject to strict regulatory controls, and is not currently being used for crop improvement.

recently, a powerful reverse genetics approach was implemented in wheat through the combination of ethyl methane sulphonate -mediated mutagenesis and tilling technology  <cit> . briefly, a tilling screen starts with pcr amplification of a target region from pooled dna of mutagenized plants. this is followed by a mismatch-specific endonuclease digestion that is visualized by size-separation on polyacrylamide or agarose gels to identify mutant individuals. once a positive individual is found it is sequenced to determine the exact mutation it carries. gene function is assigned based on phenotypic evaluation of the mutant individuals.

tilling is a flexible reverse genetics approach that generates a lasting resource that can be utilized to screen multiple targets. ems-mediated mutagenesis is efficient in different genetic backgrounds allowing cultivar-specific libraries to be constructed according to the required needs. alleles generated by tilling can be readily used in traditional breeding programs since the technology is non-transgenic and the mutations are stably inherited. these advantages are reflected by the successful implementation of tilling in several plant species such as arabidopsis  <cit> , maize  <cit> , wheat  <cit> , barley  <cit> , rice  <cit> , pea  <cit> , potato  <cit> , lotus japonicus  <cit>  and soybean  <cit> .

most tilling systems rely on the use of high-throughput genotyping platforms, such as li-cor gene analyzers, which use fluorescently labeled primers and are relatively expensive setups for individual laboratories. the investment and technical skills required for tilling could be barriers to the adoption of this technology. recently, agarose based detection systems have been suggested as inexpensive alternatives to the current technology intensive platforms  <cit> , and its use for detecting ems-induced mutations in large libraries has recently been determined  <cit> .

the ability to understand gene function will become increasingly important as more sequence information is generated in wheat. thus, there is a need for a diverse set of publicly available reverse genetic resources in wheat to assist with the functional validation of candidate genes. we report here the construction of two tilling libraries from tetraploid and hexaploid wheat and their characterization through the tilling of multiple targets. we developed a modified detection method based on polyacrylamide gel staining with ethidium bromide to make this technology more accessible and describe strategies for tilling in polyploid genomes.

RESULTS
generation of ems mutagenized population
we developed tilling populations in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat using ems as a chemical mutagen. for the tetraploid population we mutagenized seeds of the desert durum® variety 'kronos', which was developed by arizona plant breeders from a male sterile population . for the hexaploid tilling population we used the hard red spring common wheat breeding line 'uc1041+gpc-b1/yr36'. uc <dig> is a short stature breeding line developed by the university of california from the cross tadinia/yecora rojo. 'uc1041+gpc-b1/yr36' was developed later by backcrossing for six generations a 6bs chromosome segment from t. turgidum ssp. dicoccoides that carries the high grain protein gene gpc-b <dig>  <cit>  and the partial stripe rust resistance gene yr <dig>  <cit> . the ems concentrations used to mutagenize the populations were  <dig>  to  <dig> %  for kronos and  <dig>  to  <dig> %  for 'uc1041+gpc-b1/yr36'. similar ems concentrations have been used previously to create tilling population in wheat  <cit> . germination rates for ems-treated seeds were ~50–60% . we extracted dna from single m <dig> plants and collected their m <dig> seeds to have independent and non-redundant mutations in our libraries. dnas from a total of  <dig>  m <dig>  and  <dig>  m <dig>  plants were pooled in groups of four dnas and organized into four 96-well plates for convenient screening . the tetraploid tilling population is currently being expanded to  <dig>  lines.

development of genome specific primers
we characterized the tilling libraries by screening for mutations in the two starch branching enzyme ii genes, sbeiia and sbeiib, for tetraploid wheat and for mutations in the wheat kinase start   <dig>  wks <dig> and sbeiia genes in hexaploid wheat. wks <dig> and wks <dig> are single copy genes on chromosome arm 6bs  <cit> , so there was no need to develop genome specific primers. sbeiia and sbeiib map to chromosome  <dig> and have homoeologous loci in each of the different wheat genomes. to screen for mutations in each of the homoeologous copies we designed primers specific for each copy taking advantage of polymorphic indels and snps between the different homoeologues. we designed primers complementary to intron sequences flanking the target exons and positioned approximately ~200-bp from the sequence of interest. the genome specificity of the sbeii primers was validated using nulli-tetrasomic lines of chromosome  <dig> , dnas from bac clones from the a and b genomes obtained from a tetraploid bac library  <cit>  and aegilops tauschii genomic dna.

wheat tilling platform using the non-denaturing polyacrylamide detection method
the screening of a tilling population includes three fundamental steps: an initial screen of dna pools to identify those that contain mutant individuals; a second screen to identify the individual within each pool that contains a putative mutation; and lastly, confirmation of the individual mutations by sequencing of the pcr products. although some modifications exist, such as directly sequencing all individuals from a positive pool, most tilling approaches follow this general framework.

we developed a tilling platform that uses a non-denaturing polyacrylamide detection method to perform the two rounds of screening. after digestion of mismatches in heteroduplexes with celery juice extract , the fragments resulting from dsdna cuts at mismatched sites are separated in native polyacrylamide gels and visualized through the fluorescence of bound ethidium bromide. for the initial step, the screen identifies the 4× pools with mutant individuals . targets are amplified by pcr from the four genomic dnas that comprise each positive pool . pcr products are then combined in four two-fold pools, heated and annealed to achieve heteroduplex formation, and finally digested with cje . depending on the banding pattern , the mutation is assigned to one of the four individual dnas . the mutant individual is then sequenced and the identity of the mutation is established . a more detailed description can be found in the methods section.

this method provides an independent validation of the mutation, identifies its location within the target region, and determines which individual from the pool carries the mutation. the paired pooling  is necessary to detect homozygous mutations in the m <dig> plants since combining two samples allows heteroduplex formation and detection. this strategy also reduces the number of false positive errors as a true mutation should be observed in two separate gel lanes .

screening of wks <dig>  wks <dig> and sbeiia in the hexaploid library yielded  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> mutations, respectively . this translates into an estimated mutation density of at least one mutation per  <dig>  kb screened in the hexaploid library. in the tetraploid library, we detected  <dig> and  <dig> mutants for sbeiia and sbeiib, respectively. using a similar analysis as above, the estimated mutation density in the tetraploid library is at least one mutation per  <dig> kb screened. the relevance of these mutations was recently confirmed by fu et al.  <cit>  who used the wks <dig> missense and wks <dig> nonsense mutations  to validate a candidate gene for broad-spectrum disease resistance. for the sbe genes  we have identified and selected mutants that include splice junction mutations, a premature stop codon and several missense mutations that are predicted to have an effect on sbe protein activity. we have initiated the backcrossing of the mutants into non-mutagenized lines of kronos and uc <dig> to reduce the mutation load of the lines for future phenotypic analysis. the ability to identify truncation mutations in five of the seven sbe targets and putative non-functional amino acid substitutions in the remaining genes highlights the power of this approach for functional gene analysis.

a pssm and sift scores are not reported for mutations that cause premature stop codons

six wks <dig> and three wks <dig> mutants were scored as susceptible or resistant based on their reaction to puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici  in fu et al.  <cit> . in the nucleotide/amino acid change columns, the first letter indicates the wild type nucleotide/amino acid, the number its position from the start codon/methionine, and the last letter the mutant nucleotide/amino acid. high pssm  and low sift scores  predict mutations with severe effects on protein function.

a pssm and sift scores are not reported for mutations that cause premature stop codons or splice junction mutations

in the nucleotide change column, the position is relative to the forward primer used for the specific target since we do not have the complete genomic sequence for all sbe genes. in the amino acid change column, the position is relative to the start methionine based on the predicted amino acid sequence of the ae. tauschii sequence .

in an m <dig> population, 33% of the mutations are expected to be found in homozygous state. for both populations we had a slight bias towards homozygous mutations, 37% in hexaploid and 42% in tetraploid, although these percentages were not significantly different from the expected 33% . sequencing also confirmed that over 99% of the mutations were g to a or c to t transitions as expected from alkylation by ems, with only one exception in the sbeiia a genome target which was a c to g transversion .

using the coddle  program  <cit> , we predicted the effect of ems mutations in the different amplicons. in the hexaploid library we identified a total of  <dig> mutations of which 40% were missense and  <dig> % were truncations . the predicted effects by coddle were 35% missense and  <dig> % truncations, very close to the observed values . in the tetraploid screen we identified  <dig> mutations of which 28% were missense and  <dig> % were truncations, whereas coddle predicted 22% missense mutations and  <dig> % truncations. for both libraries, the distribution of silent, missense and truncation mutations were not significantly different from those predicted by coddle .

several of the mutations in the wks and sbe genes were identified in more than one independent individual. in the hexaploid library,  <dig> % of the mutations were found in duplicate or triplicate , which was higher  than the expected  <dig> % calculated using a poisson distribution and the number of potential gc sites in the screened region. in the tetraploid library  <dig> % of the mutations were found in more than one individual . these numbers were again higher  than the expected  <dig> % predicted by a poisson distribution.

comparison between li-cor and non-denaturing polyacrylamide detection method
laser detection of fluorescently labeled dna fragments, using a li-cor genotyping platform, is the most widely used detection method to screen tilling populations for mutations. to evaluate an alternative to this detection method, we screened two regions in both wks <dig> and wks <dig> using a non-denaturing 3% polyacrylamide set-up  and compared the results with an established li-cor platform.

tilling of the same four wks targets in  <dig> m <dig> individuals from the hexaploid library revealed that these two methods detect comparable number of mutations . we used the method of greene et al.  <cit>  to estimate mutation densities . we adjusted the total length of each target as mutations in the regions closest to the primers are not readily detected by either method. for the li-cor screen we subtracted 160-bp  <cit> , whereas for the 3% polyacrylamide screen we subtracted 10% of the target region at each end. this value was determined empirically as mutations were only detected in the central 80% of the target sequence  for all genes .

a  <dig> m <dig> plants were screened

four target regions where examined in the same  <dig> m <dig> plants from the hexaploid tilling population and the total sequence screened was adjusted according to each method .

using the li-cor detection technology we estimated a mutation frequency of  <dig> mutation per  <dig> kb , whereas using the polyacrylamide setup we estimated  <dig> mutation per  <dig>  kb . overall, each method detected two or three mutants not detected by the other method, but the majority of the mutations were detected by both. the exception to this was the wks <dig> start domain target region in which the li-cor screen identified eleven additional mutations . despite this, the average mutation frequencies for the four targets were almost identical. this suggests that when using fourfold pools , the polyacrylamide/ethidium bromide set-up has similar sensitivity to detect snps compared to the li-cor platform, although there may be slight differences depending on the target region.

discussion
characterization of the ems mutagenized populations
the use of reverse genetic approaches to determine gene function will become increasingly important as large amounts of sequence information become available in wheat. in an effort to address this, we created ems-induced tilling libraries in tetraploid and hexaploid wheat. we use the tetraploid tilling population to generate mutants for basic research projects because it is easier and faster to generate complete null mutants. a single generation of crosses between a and b genome mutations, followed by selection of homozygous double mutants in the f <dig> populations is sufficient to generate null mutants. however, when a targeted mutant has important commercial applications  we screen the hexaploid tilling population for mutations, because hexaploid wheat represents most of the wheat grown around the world   <cit> .

characterization of these populations through the screening of several targets revealed mutation densities of at least one mutation per  <dig> -kb and 68-kb in the hexaploid and tetraploid libraries, respectively. these mutation densities are lower than those found by slade et al.  <cit>  in wheat using similar ems concentrations . the difference observed in these two studies is likely dependent on the different gc content of the target regions employed in the two studies, because ems mutagenesis acts predominantly on gc residues  <cit> . slade et al.  <cit>  characterized their libraries by screening for mutants in the waxy genes. the regions included in their work have an unusually high gc content  whereas regions targeted in our study have an average gc content of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the tetraploid and hexaploid targets, respectively. these values must be taken into account when estimating mutation densities because they represent the maximum number of mutations that can be found in those particular targets. for example, adjusting our reported mutation densities to the average gc content in slade et al.  <cit>   would yield new densities of one mutation per 34-kb and 44-kb for the hexaploid and tetraploid libraries, respectively. for future studies involving species where ems mutagenesis is limited to gc>at changes, it would be beneficial to report mutation densities corrected for a 50% gc content, or specify the gc content of the target regions, to allow for more meaningful comparisons. applying this criterion, our mutation densities would be one mutation per 38-kb and 51-kb for the hexaploid and tetraploid libraries, respectively, in a target with 50% gc content.

independent of the gc content, our reported mutation densities were lower than those reported by slade et al.  <cit> , by 43% in the hexaploid and 9% in the tetraploid population. the response of different hexaploid genetic backgrounds to ems could account for some differences between the hexaploid libraries. this explanation cannot be applied to the tetraploid libraries since both studies used the same cultivar kronos. slight differences in ems concentration and treatment conditions, environmental effects and experimental differences in the detection methods for both studies  could account for the remaining variation.

wheat is especially well suited for tilling because of the tolerance of recently evolved polyploid species to high mutation densities  <cit> . the vast majority of greenhouse grown plants was fertile and displayed no apparent mutant phenotype. the mutation frequencies for wheat reported here and by slade et al.  <cit>  are five to ten times higher than mutation rates found in diploids such as barley, pea and arabidopsis  <cit> . this high mutation frequency facilitates the identification of large allelic series in target genes using relatively small tilling populations. for example, by screening  <dig>  lines for a 1625-bp target region  we would expect to recover approximately  <dig> mutant alleles in the hexaploid library and  <dig> mutant alleles in the tetraploid library. analysis of the mutations obtained in this study confirmed that the frequencies predicted by coddle were accurate and can be used to estimate the expected proportion of the different types of mutations to be recovered.

in an average tilling fragment, truncation mutations are expected in  <dig> to 5% of the cases. therefore, the large number of mutant alleles expected when tilling an effective  <dig>  kb region  provides a high probability number of alleles]) of obtaining at least one truncation mutation. in our screen using targets with lower gc content  we found truncations for  <dig> % and 75% of the targets in the hexaploid and tetraploid libraries, respectively. this probability will vary according to gc content and can be improved by increasing the size of the target region if the gene is large enough .

strategies for tilling in polyploid genomes
the high probability of identifying truncation mutants is very important in a polyploid species, such as wheat, where the phenotype of a single mutant may be masked by the wild-type homoeologue present in another genome. because of gene redundancy, it is generally necessary to cross single mutants in the a and b genome homoeologues to obtain a functional knockout in tetraploid wheat or create the triple a/b/d mutant in hexaploid wheat. employing missense mutations in these lengthy genetic schemes is risky because if one of the mutations is not effective, it may be sufficient to limit the effect of the combined mutations on function. for the a and b genomes, the search for nonsense or splice junction mutations can involve both tetraploid and hexaploid tilling populations, since mutations can be transferred by crossing. hybridization of kronos and uc <dig> produces a pentaploid f <dig>  which can be used as a female in subsequent backcrossing until fertility is restored.

bioinformatics algorithms such as sift  <cit>  and pssm can be used to prioritize mutants for phenotypic evaluation, as reported before for wks <dig>  <cit> . all five mutations with significant pssm and sift scores were loss-of-function mutants of the resistance gene that led to susceptibility to the causal agent of stripe rust, puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici . the only mutant line that remained resistant was t6- <dig> that had a non-significant sift score  and a borderline significant pssm score . despite this successful example for the use of sift and pssm, the decision of using a missense mutation should be weighed against the amount of time and work that would be invested in producing double and triple mutants. the optimum strategy will depend on the objective and the gene being studied, as in some cases homoeologues are naturally deleted  or are not expressed.

the high mutation density in our libraries also implies that any given individual is predicted to carry between  <dig>   and  <dig>   mutations. since most of the wheat genome  is represented by highly repetitive elements, and likely less than 3% of the wheat dna encodes for genes , most of the mutations will be outside the genes. even after correcting for repetitive regions, for coding sequence space within a gene, and for the proportion of mutations that result in missense or truncations, each individual from the tilling population is expected to carry thousands of missense mutations and hundreds of truncations. a simple way to reduce this large amount of background mutations is to backcross the mutants to the non-mutagenized recurrent parent for two to three generations. these backcross generations are essential when the mutations are being used for wheat breeding because the background mutations can reduce the average performance of the populations generated directly from crosses with the original mutants. the mutant snp can be tracked in the backcrossing scheme by direct sequencing of the genome-specific amplicon in each generation. alternatively, many snps lead to polymorphisms in restriction sites which can be used to develop cleavage amplified polymorphism  markers. alternatively, derived cap  markers can also be designed  <cit> . ultimately, the most effective strategy will depend on the costs of sequencing and restriction enzymes for each lab.

for research projects with a clear phenotype, selecting for sister lines homozygous for the presence and absence of the mutation is an effective strategy. sister lines with and without the mutations share many of the same background mutations, thus serving as a better control than the wild-type line with no background mutations. this approach is especially powerful when multiple sets of independent sister lines are examined  <cit>  as the probability of finding mutations by chance in a linked gene is extremely low. for example, with the mutation densities of the hexaploid population , the probability of finding at least one an amino acid change in any  <dig>  kb coding region is  <dig> % ]1500}* <dig> ); as 66% of gc>at codon changes are non-synonymous]. if two or three independent lines were examined, then this probability drops dramatically .

primer design in polyploid species
primer design is an important aspect of tilling in polyploid species. genome specificity needs to be combined with a high yielding pcr product for proper mutant detection. the first step in designing genome specific primers is the sequencing of the different homoeologous copies. these sequences can be obtained for highly expressed genes by a bioinformatics characterization of available wheat ests. alternatively, genome sequences can be generated by screening the bac libraries and sequencing from individual bacs or by sequencing the diploid donors of the different wheat genomes. we routinely use t. urartu for the a genome, ae. tauschii for the d genome  and t. speltoides as the best approximation to the b genome. if better sequences for the b genome are required, a fast strategy is to clone and sequence several clones from pcr products obtained from tetraploid wheat.

the optimal target regions were defined by the coddle program using the following criteria: a) mutations close to primers  are not readily detected, particularly in large amplification products b) maximize exons and/or intron-exon splice junctions and c) maximize regions encoding for conserved domains within the protein. primers are usually designed in the introns or 5' or 3' utrs flanking the target exons as these regions are more polymorphic .

different strategies can be used to generate genome-specific primers   <cit> . if one of the primers can overlap a unique in/del or multiple intergenomic snps, this is usually sufficient to generate genome specificity . in other cases, where there is lower polymorphism between homoeologues, both primers can be designed such that the first nucleotide from the 3' end of the primers aligns to genome-specific snps . in these cases, increased specificity can be attained by introducing a mismatch in the primer at the third or fourth position from the 3' end. although this generates a mismatch between the target sequence and the primer , the two mismatches with the other homoeologues increase the probability of genome-specific amplification. these strategies can be combined as in the sbeiia b genome primers  and used in conjunction with touchdown pcr to increase specificity.

non-denaturing polyacrylamide detection method
we report here the use of a modified screening technique that can be used to detect mutations in tilling populations. we found equivalent mutations using the li-cor and 3% non-denaturing polyacrylamide, suggesting that this system represents a viable low-cost alternative to the current technologies. our 3% non-denaturing polyacrylamide system is based on ethidium bromide staining, eliminating the need for the genotyping instrument and fluorescently labeled primers. this is especially relevant in polyploid genomes as the fluorescent label attached to primers can reduce their genome specificity, requiring additional pcr optimization. samples can be loaded directly after stopping the cje digestion reaction with  <dig>  m edta, eliminating the subsequent steps of sample purification and volume reduction required in li-cor screens. we also found that by extending and optimizing the cje digestion time  we observed digestion of both strands, despite celi being a single strand mismatch-specific endonuclease. this additional cje activity eliminates the need of denaturing polyacrylamide gels which are more time consuming and technically more difficult than a non-denaturing system. although we are able to increase the size of our target regions to over  <dig> -kb, we were unable to find mutations in the first 10% of the sequences adjacent to each primer. therefore the total sequence screened is roughly similar to the li-cor method  with the disadvantage that more sequence information is needed in our method to accommodate the larger distance between the primers and the region where mutations are effectively detected.

an additional advantage of the li-cor system, is that the use of different dyes for each primer allows a precise estimation for the location of the mutant. in our set-up, two possible locations are estimated since we have no information as to whether the estimated distance is from the forward or the reverse primer. this implies an additional cost for sequencing a larger number of mutants to identify ems-induced polymorphism in the desired regions. another possible drawback of this set-up is the need for manual analysis of the gels since no software has been developed for this system. despite this, gel image analysis requires approximately 20– <dig> minutes, similar to the time required with gelbuddy or similar gel analysis programs.

for both libraries we found a number of duplicate mutations, as well as a few triple and quadruple mutations, that were higher than expected by chance. these mutations are likely residual polymorphisms in the mutagenized seed, originated from residual heterozygous alleles in some of the plants used for the production of breeder's seed of kronos or the seed stock for uc1041+gpc-b1/yr <dig>  for example, we confirmed that the original seed stock of uc1041+gpc-b1/yr <dig> is polymorphic for a known 1-bp deletion in the coding region of the vrn-d <dig> allele  <cit> . these observations also suggest that the polyacrylamide detection method should be amenable for ecotilling  <cit> .

the polyacrylamide detection method is especially relevant for species, such as wheat, that have no central tilling service available. even if a central service for wheat becomes available, individual researchers may need to till genotypes carrying specific alleles  that may be absent in available tilling populations. although several alternative detection methods have been published, most rely on expensive equipment  that precludes many individual laboratories from performing tilling. the development of a non-denaturing polyacrylamide detection system makes tilling more accessible to a larger set of researchers and breeding programs and may facilitate the development of multiple wheat tilling populations. we plan to make the dnas of our tilling lines available on a cost recovery basis for other research groups to screen  <cit> . this should enable different research groups to screen for mutations in their gene of interest and expand their capabilities for wheat functional genomics.

we have pursued further characterization of over  <dig> mutants for the wks  <cit>  and sbeii genes. although the phenotypic characterization of the sbeii mutants is beyond the scope of this work, we have successfully confirmed each wks and sbeii mutation in its corresponding m <dig> seed stock. this is an important final validation step, suggesting that the two libraries will be an effective reverse genetics resource.

other groups are also currently developing tilling resources in wheat. these include tetraploid libraries in variety 'cham 1' <cit>  as well as hexaploid libraries in several varieties , cadenza  <cit>  and 'qal2000' and 'ventura' in australia  <cit> ). the generation of multiple tilling libraries in wheat will allow an even greater flexibility and robustness to wheat tilling as any targets which are missing in one population could be screened for in others.

CONCLUSIONS
we show here that tilling constitutes an effective way to screen large wheat mutant libraries for induced polymorphisms. the high mutation densities tolerated by recently evolved polyploids makes this approach especially attractive as a reverse genetics platform for wheat. the development of a low-cost detection method that has similar assay sensitivity to the li-cor technology, together with public access to these tilling populations, will likely make this technology more accessible. we hope that researchers will use these libraries to create novel allelic diversity for breeding pasta and common wheat and to better understand basic gene function in these important crop species. we think that the new tilling resources will shift the paradigm of what can be done in functional gene analysis in wheat.
