BACKGROUND
patterns of within-species variation in animal mtdna are influenced by various factors, including mutation, selection, demography and geography, and analysis of haplotype diversity patterns can provide information on population structure and gene flow. in addition, mtdna sequences are often used to investigate the evolutionary history of a species, by combining geographic and phylogenetic information in phylogeographic studies  <cit> . however, theory predicts that mtdna variation and evolution may also be influenced substantially by endosymbionts that are maternally co-inherited with the mitochondria  <cit> . in insects, maternally-inherited intracellular wolbachia bacteria are of particular concern, because they have been detected in hundreds of species  <cit>  and are estimated to infect about 2/ <dig> of all insect species  <cit> . wolbachia cause various modifications of host reproductive biology, including cytoplasmic incompatibility , parthenogenesis, feminisation and male-killing  <cit> . in addition, a single infection can be responsible for causing more than one phenotype, e.g. ci and male-killing  <cit> . wolbachia enhance their own spread through the host population by means of these phenotypes and, in so doing, drive the associated host mitochondrial haplotypes to high frequencies, causing dramatic changes in host mtdna patterns  <cit> . consequently, analysis of variation in insect mtdna should take account of possible endosymbiont effects whilst attempting to uncover and explain patterns in terms of host ecology  <cit> .

here, we explore the role of wolbachia bacteria in explaining patterns of mtdna variation in the diamondback moth , a global pest of brassica plants . a previous study  <cit>  reported the occurrence of two different wolbachia isolates in two different p. xylostella individuals during a general screening of diverse insects for wolbachia infections; however, there have been no wider studies of the occurrence of these isolates in p. xylostella or of their effects on host phenotypes and genetic variation. consequently, we screened individuals from four continents for wolbachia infections and then investigated the correlation between infection with the dominant isolate  and mtdna variation. we also sequenced a biparentally inherited nuclear gene marker, whose phylogeny should reflect demography and geography, but not any wolbachia-associated driving of cytoplasmic factors. in addition, we conducted experiments to test whether plutwb <dig> produces a phenotypic effect on the host that is likely to drive the infection, and its associated mtdna haplotype, through local populations.

the diamondback moth is amongst the most globally distributed of all lepidoptera  <cit> . it is generally thought to be endemic to the mediterranean region  <cit> , although an african origin has also been suggested  <cit> . its current global distribution is due to two processes – natural migrations and man-made introductions. direct observations using vertical-looking radar have confirmed that long distance migration from continental europe is the source of populations in the uk in late spring  <cit> . meanwhile, transport to many disparate locations across the globe is likely to be the result of accidental introductions during vegetable shipments  <cit> . consequently, we predict an unusually weak correlation between geographic and genetic  divergence in p. xylostella because recent human activity has moved moths between continents.

in summary, we screened p. xylostella samples from four continents in order to:  determine the global diversity and prevalence of wolbachia infections,  test whether wolbachia infections were associated with particular mtdna haplotypes,  test whether plutwb <dig> produces a drive phenotype, 4) test for a breakdown of the usual strong link between geographic continent of origin and mtdna sequence variation, and 5) compare mtdna results with those from a nuclear marker that should not have its phylogeny shaped by cytoplasmic drive mechanisms.

RESULTS
global screening for wolbachia in p. xylostella
in order to explore the prevalence and diversity of wolbachia, we screened  <dig> individuals from  <dig> countries on four continents  and isolated three wolbachia isolates, termed plutwa <dig>  plutwa <dig> and plutwb <dig> . the first two isolates were extremely rare and found in only two individuals each, while plutwb <dig> was found in about 5%  of the global sample of individuals . we detected wolbachia only in individuals from malaysia, kenya and germany. however, even in these countries, most individuals were uninfected .

moth mtdna phylogeny
we obtained mtdna sequences for  <dig> p. xylostella individuals and three members of the closely related outgroup species plutella porrectalla . the mtdna fragment analysed consisted of  <dig> bp of the co <dig> gene. there were  <dig> variable nucleotide sites, of which  <dig> were informative for maximum parsimony  analyses. this variation yielded  <dig> discrete haplotypes , of which  <dig> where unique to one individual.

mp and neighbour-joining  phylogenies were very similar and revealed a deep split  between all individuals infected with plutwb <dig> and all those that were not . in contrast, the largest pairwise distance between any two uninfected individuals was only  <dig> %. we sequenced  <dig> individuals from kenya and malaysia that were infected with plutwb <dig>  they all had very similar coi sequences, with maximum pairwise divergence of only  <dig> %, forming haplotypes 1– <dig> and a well-supported monophyletic clade . this supports a single origin of the infection and we further tested for an association between mtdna haplotypes and plutwb <dig> by randomising the infection status of individuals across the tips of the phylogeny and calculating the minimum number of changes in infection status implied . all of the  <dig> randomisations implied more than the one change observed in the actual data set, providing significant support  for the association between infection status and haplotype that is apparent by eye. in contrast to the clear pattern found with this isolate, the two a clade wolbachia isolates were each found in only two individuals, precluding further useful analysis.

in general, individuals do not cluster on the phylogeny according to their geographic origin. however, all individuals from australia  and new zealand , along with one from malaysia  form a well-supported monophyletic clade . australasia was the best sampled region, with individuals from  <dig> sites spanning most of australia, as well as two sites in new zealand.

mtdna haplotype analysis
haplotype and nucleotide diversity estimates for different geographic regions are presented in table  <dig>  nucleotide diversity  for each region is generally low but ranges from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the highest nucleotide diversity was found in asia, followed by africa; importantly, these are the two regions that harboured the plutwb <dig> infection and its associated divergent haplotypes. australasia showed the lowest haplotype diversity and nucleotide diversity, despite field sampling from  <dig> sites across australia and two in new zealand. this is reflected further by comparisons with data from hawaii . hawaii, like australasia, is isolated by sea from other continents and was probably only colonised relatively recently by p. xylostella due to human travel. only four individuals from hawaii were sampled, but these had higher haplotype diversity than the australasian individuals and values similar to those in europe. all infected groups have lower haplotype number, and haplotype and nucleotide diversity, than their respective uninfected groups .

key: n = no. individuals; nhap = no. haplotypes; dhap = haplotype diversity; s = no. of variable sites; π = nucleotide diversity.

moth nuclear dna
we also analysed approximately  <dig> bp of the l27a nuclear ribosomal protein gene for the same  <dig> p. xylostella individuals. we obtained  <dig> different sequences ,  <dig> of which were unique to one individual. however, there was low sequence divergence and the vast majority of pairs of individuals differed by only 1– <dig> nucleotide substitutions. further, many substitutions were unique and therefore not phylogenetically informative. nevertheless, two clades can be defined by the presence/absence of a  <dig> bp indel event. clade a contained  <dig> individuals from all five continents, while clade b contained  <dig> individuals from europe, asia and africa . in contrast to the case for mtdna, there were not separate infected and uninfected clades. a mixture of infected and uninfected individuals occurred in each clade. all individuals from australasia were in clade a, indicating that australasian populations have reduced nuclear diversity compared to most other countries , as suggested by endersby  <cit> , based on microsatellite markers.

sequence variation in the wolbachia wsp gene
the plutwb <dig> isolate found in our study shows high sequence divergence  from the b-clade wolbachia isolate  previously identified infecting p. xylostella  <cit>  . however, it has the same wsp sequence  as an isolate found infecting the african butterfly, acraea pentapolis  <cit> .

phenotypic effects of wolbachia
we found a female biased sex ratio of approximately  <dig>   in field p. xylostella populations in the cameron highlands, malaysia . the sex ratio was only significantly different from 1: <dig> for the site with the largest sample . however, the sex ratio was actually remarkably consistent  between the four sites surveyed in this region .

we successfully established two infected and three uninfected isofemale lines from field-caught malaysian p. xylostella individuals and maintained them in the laboratory for nine generations . the two infected lines had female biased mean sex ratios  that were similar but slightly more biased than those observed in the field populations  and these did not change significantly over nine generations of laboratory culture . in contrast, the uninfected lines had unbiased sex ratios  . the plutwb <dig> infection appears to be a sex ratio distorter that increases the proportion of female hosts, as infected lines have significantly higher proportions of females than uninfected lines .

the proportion of infected individuals in infected lines decreased over the nine generations , suggesting that vertical transmission of wolbachia is not perfect. this was also found when both sexes were tested separately . there was no significant difference between the sexes, with a mean of 68% of males and 74% of females infected .

discussion
wolbachia infections in p. xylostella
we detected three different wolbachia isolates in plutella xylostella. the two a-clade isolates were very rare, each occurring in only two individual moths. the b-clade isolate plutwb <dig> was more common, but, where present in malaysia and kenya occurred at low frequencies of about 10%. it is therefore likely that further screening in some of the other countries will also reveal plutwb <dig> . interestingly, plutwb <dig> differs considerably in wsp sequence from a previously reported b-clade infection  of p. xylostella in the usa  <cit> . it thus appears that p. xylostella has acquired different wolbachia infections in different parts of its now global distribution. none of these infections appears common or widespread and some may be transient.

interestingly, the whitefly bemisia tabaci, another major crop pest with an essentially global distribution, has also been found to harbour a number of different wolbachia infections  <cit> . the plutwb <dig> infection in p. xylostella is present in at least two continents and these insects probably stem from a single ancestral infection event, since their mtdna haplotypes are very similar and form a well-supported and differentiated monophyletic group within the p. xylostella coi phylogeny . there is a small amount of variation in both the coi sequences of infected individuals  and the wsp sequences of their infections , reflecting a small amount of evolution since the original infection event.

phylogenies, infection and geography
the host coi phylogeny has two major clades that correlate perfectly with presence or absence of the plutwb <dig> infection. the association between the very similar haplotypes 1– <dig> and plutwb <dig> infection supports the idea that wolbachia have driven this haplotype group to a significant if low frequency in infected populations. our study further suggests that this infection is a sex ratio distorter and this phenotypic effect upon the host is likely to have driven the infection and associated haplotype group into the wider population. in contrast, there is little correlation between mtdna haplotype and geographic origin. infected and uninfected individuals from the same site in malaysia  fall into the two different clades rather than group together.

in contrast, there is little tendency for individuals from the same country or even continent to cluster together in the mtdna phylogeny . however, the lack of this pattern is consistent with recent and repeated movements of insects between continents due to trade in cruciferous crops. it is interesting that australasia stands out as an exception to the general pattern. we sampled many australian populations and two from new zealand and all individuals belong to a single clade with very little mtdna variation. this suggests that australian and nz populations probably stem from a single colonisation event from asia around  <dig> years ago  <cit>  that was then transferred from australia to nz or vice versa. the very low mtdna diversity could reflect a small initial founder population from se asia. low variation in the l27a gene  and low microsatellite diversity  <cit>  in australian individuals further support this idea and suggest success of stringent quarantine procedures in modern times  <cit> .

finally, we note that selection for resistance to pesticides and biocontrol agents  <cit>  may also influence p. xylostella genetic variation. however, this would most likely influence both mtdna and nuclear dna, while our main result is a clear association of a sex-ratio distorting infection with patterns of mtdna variation.

sex ratio distortion
our data show that the plutwb <dig> infection is associated with substantial sex ratio distortion, so that females outnumber males about two to one in infected lines. the fact that infection frequency was the same in males and females in our experiments argues against it being a male-killer. however, such a low infection frequency would be surprising for a feminizing bacterium, but is not unusual for a male-killer and host resistance to male-killing can evolve, as in the butterfly hypolimnas bolina  <cit> . male-killing alone cannot explain the sex ratio bias in our infected lab lines and feminisation of genetic males is an interesting possibility for future study. it is also possible that a more complicated scenario could apply and that wolbachia is not, or not the only, agent of sex ratio bias  <cit> . our evidence for the role of wolbachia is currently only correlational, which is an important but not definitive line of evidence  <cit> . recent work has revealed that other less common, but still widespread  <cit>  insect endosymbionts can cause similar hosts effects to wolbachia  <cit> . furthermore, detailed analysis of a case involving ostrinia moths, initially thought to involve a feminising wolbachia isolate, has revealed complex fitness interactions between sex chromosomes and infection status leading to differential mortality by sex  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
global patterns of mtdna variation in the diamondback moth are shaped largely by the presence or absence of the plutwb <dig> wolbachia infection. this occurs patchily at low frequencies and apparently distorts host sex ratios to a 2: <dig> bias in favour of females. the cause and mode of sex ratio distortion deserves further study. in contrast to infection status, the geographic origin of a given individual is a poor predictor of its mtdna haplotype, due to recent human transport of insects between continents in vegetable crops.
