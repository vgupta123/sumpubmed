BACKGROUND
treatment of lactating cows with recombinant bovine somatotropin  can increase milk yield in thermoneutral and heat-stress environments  <cit> . the consequences of bst treatment for fertility are not clear. in early studies, cows treated with bst had an increased calving to conception interval that was attributed, at least in part, to increased anestrus  <cit> . in contrast, bst either increased  <cit>  or had no effect  <cit>  on pregnancy rate per insemination when cows were inseminated using a timed artificial insemination  protocol. treatment with bst increased pregnancy rate per insemination for repeat-breeder cows bred at estrus  <cit> .

bovine st might be particularly effective at increasing fertility during periods of heat stress. this is because insulin-like growth factor- <dig> , whose secretion is stimulated by bst  <cit> , has thermoprotective properties and can reduce the effect of elevated temperature on development and apoptosis of cultured bovine embryos  <cit> . indeed, the proportion of heat-stressed lactating cows receiving an in vitro produced embryo that became pregnant was higher when embryos were cultured in igf- <dig> before transfer  <cit> . this effect of igf- <dig> was not seen for cows in cool weather  <cit> .

despite the promise of using bst in the summer to increase igf- <dig> and improve embryonic resistance to heat stress, there was no effect of bst on pregnancy rate in the one experiment that examined bst effects on fertility during heat stress  <cit> . in this experiment, cows received bst every  <dig> days beginning  <dig> days before tai. the failure to observe an increase in fertility caused by bst may have been because bst also increased body temperature.

the hypothesis of the current study was that a single injection of a sustained-release preparation of bst during the preovulatory period could improve fertility of lactating cows. the rationale for the hypothesis was that bst, directly or through an increase in igf- <dig> secretion, would increase fertility by exerting beneficial effects on follicular function  <cit> , oocyte function  <cit>  and embryonic development  <cit> . in heat–stressed cows, bst would also be thermoprotective towards the embryo through actions of igf- <dig>  <cit> . treatment with bst was limited to a single injection around the time of ovulation to exert effects on late follicular development, ovulation, and early embryonic development while avoiding milk yield responses during the peri-ovulatory period that could enhance hyperthermia or otherwise limit the possible beneficial effect of bst on fertility.

RESULTS
effects of bst at insemination in cows in a temperate climate 
as shown in table  <dig>  there was no effect of bst on the proportion of cows that were pregnant following insemination. in addition, there was no significant effect of breeding at estrus vs tai , parity or days in milk  on pregnancy rate per insemination.

effects of bst in cows exposed to heat stress 
the 24-h pattern of vaginal temperatures is shown in fig.  <dig>  time of day affected vaginal temperature . the peak temperature  for both groups was  <dig> °c and occurred at 23: <dig> h for control cows and 18: <dig> h for bst-treated cows. the nadir,  <dig> °c for both control and bst-treated cows, occurred at 08: <dig> and 09: <dig> h, respectively. vaginal temperature was not affected by bst treatment, day relative to tai, or interactions between these main effects and other variables.

body condition score at tai was not different between control and bst-treated cows .

cows were considered to be successfully synchronized if progesterone concentration on the day of tai  was <  <dig> ng/ml and progesterone concentration on day  <dig> after tai was ≥  <dig> ng/ml. using this criterion, there was a tendency  for a lower percent of control cows to be synchronized than bst-treated cows . further examination of progesterone concentrations revealed that, regardless of treatment, over 90% of cows had low progesterone concentrations  at day  <dig>  however, there was a tendency  for a smaller percent of control cows to have high progesterone  at day  <dig> than for bst-treated cows . thus, a smaller percent of cows ovulated in response to tai for control cows than for bst-treated cows.

body condition score  at tai also affected the successful synchronization rate . cows with bcs ≥  <dig>  were more likely to have been successfully synchronized  than cows with bcs <  <dig>   .

results for pregnancy following tai are presented in table  <dig>  among all cows, the percent of cows pregnant following tai was not statistically affected by treatment. numerically, the percent of inseminated cows that was pregnant was lower for control cows  than for cows treated with bst . this nonsignificant difference between groups was diminished in magnitude when the percent of inseminated cows that were pregnant was calculated for the subset of cows that were successfully synchronized .

discussion
results from the present study failed to support the hypothesis that administration of a sustained-release form of bst near the time of insemination improves fertility of lactating dairy cows. the hypothesis that bst improves fertility was tested independently at two different locations, with two different commercial bst preparations and using different breeding procedures. in the first experiment, conducted in the absence of heat stress and with most cows bred at natural estrus, there was no significant effect of bst on the percent of cows pregnant following first service. the preparation of bst used in the first experiment also contained vitamin e. administration of vitamin e at insemination was without effect on pregnancy rate in lactating cows  <cit> . in the second experiment, where cows were heat-stressed and where tai was the sole method for breeding cows, there was a numerical increase in the percent of cows pregnant following insemination for cows treated with bst as compared to control cows. however, this difference was not statistically different. moreover, the numerical increase associated with bst was associated with effects on the response to ovulation synchronization rather than to effects on fertilization rate or embryonic survival. specifically, bst tended to improve the percent of cows that ovulated after the ovulation synchronization protocol. the difference in percent of cows pregnant after tai between control and bst-treated cows was reduced when only successfully-synchronized cows were considered.

experiments to evaluate the beneficial effects of bst on ability of cattle to establish and maintain pregnancy after insemination in cattle have yielded variable results. administration of a single injection of bst at insemination did not improve pregnancy rate per insemination in cows  or beef heifers  <cit> . however, a single injection of bst at estrus increased the percent of repeat-breeder dairy cows pregnant following insemination  <cit> . injections of bst increased pregnancy success in dairy cows bred to tai in some studies  <cit>  but not in others  <cit> . differences in treatment regimens, product formulation, reproductive management, cow type and issues related to sample size could explain some of this variation. for example, bst improved pregnancy success for cows subjected to a presynch-ovsynch synchronization protocol but did not cause improvement for cows receiving an ovsynch protocol without presynchronization  <cit> . taken together, the lack of a consistent fertility-promoting effect of bst would contraindicate broad use of bst to improve fertility in lactating cows. additional work is needed to confirm its efficacy in selected populations of cows, for example in repeat-breeder cows  <cit> .

it was hypothesized that cows exposed to heat stress would be particularly likely to benefit from administration of bst because igf- <dig>  which is released in response to bst, can protect bovine preimplantation embryos from the deleterious effects of elevated temperature on development  <cit> . nonetheless, bst did not improve fertility in experiment  <dig> despite the fact that cows experienced vaginal temperatures characteristic of hyperthermia  throughout most of the day. there are several explanations for the lack of effect of bst during heat stress. for instance, it is possible that bst was not administered until damage to the oocyte had already occurred. heat stress can compromise the follicle somewhere between 20– <dig> days before ovulation  <cit>  and administration of bst three days before ovulation, as performed here, would probably not reverse oocyte damage occurring earlier in follicular development. the bst was not administered earlier relative to ovulation in experiment  <dig> because of the desire to avoid the effect of bst on milk yield that could possibly result in increased body temperature  <cit> . in fact, the bst treatment did not increase vaginal temperature. another possibility is that early embryos are refractory to the thermoprotective actions of igf- <dig>  the only stage of development at which igf- <dig> has been shown to reduce negative effects of elevated temperature on embryos is at day  <dig> after insemination  <cit> . finally, it is possible that treatment with bst may not change the bioavailable igf- <dig> in the follicular, oviductal or uterine environment sufficiently to protect oocytes or embryos from elevated temperature. treatment of lactating cows with bst increased amounts of igf- <dig> in follicular fluid but not in uterine flushings  <cit> .

in experiment  <dig>  the proportion of cows that ovulated following the ovulation synchronization protocol tended to be greater for cows treated with bst. this possible effect of bst did not reflect a difference in luteolysis following administration of pgf2α because there was no difference between control and bst-treated cows in the proportion of cows with low progesterone concentrations on the putative day of ovulation . perhaps bst increased luteinizing hormone  release in response to gnrh or increased the rate of follicular development so that preovulatory follicles were more likely to respond to lh. the literature is equivocal as to whether bst affects lh secretion  <cit>  but it is well established that bst can enhance follicular growth  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
results failed to indicate a beneficial effect of bst treatment on fertility of lactating dairy cows.
