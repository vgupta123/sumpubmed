BACKGROUND
trypanosoma cruzi is the etiological agent of chagas’ disease, which affects approximately  <dig> million people, mostly in latin america, but also in other regions due to migration and blood transfusion  <cit> . the life cycle of this parasite is complex, involving at least four well-defined life forms: the proliferative forms present in both the insect vector  and mammals  and the infectious non-dividing metacyclics  and bloodstream trypomastigotes  <cit> .

the dense glycocalyx of t. cruzi plays a fundamental role in survival and infectivity, and its molecular composition depends on the parasite’s life form. the glycocalyx is rich in glycoinositolphospholipids , either free or as protein-membrane anchors. free gipls are major cell surface constituents of the insect stages of the parasite acting as modulators of the host immune system  <cit>  and in epimastigote attachment to the midgut surface of the vector  <cit> .

mucins, the most abundant glycoproteins of t. cruzi, are highly o-glycosylated proteins tethered to the membrane via glycosylphosphatidylinositol  anchors. they are involved in protection against intestinal proteases in the insect vector  <cit>  and with the attachment to and invasion of mammalian cells  <cit> . in terms of structure, it is important to note that the o-linked glycans of t. cruzi mucins are attached to serine  or threonine  residues by n-acetylglucosamine instead of n-acetylgalactosamine as it occurs in most mammalian mucins  <cit> .

as in other eukaryotes, the synthesis of t. cruzi glycoconjugates occurs in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum  and golgi apparatus through the action of glycosyltransferases using nucleotide sugars as substrates. these sugar-activated donors must be transported across the er and golgi membranes by nucleotide sugar transporters . this intracellular transport is essential for proper protein and lipid glycosylation.

nsts comprise a family of structurally related and highly hydrophobic type iii transmembrane proteins, which have been studied in different organisms, from yeast to human  <cit> . based on a detailed membrane topology study of the mouse cmp-sialic acid transporter  <cit> , these transporters are supposed to have  <dig> transmembrane  domains with both amino- and carboxyl-termini facing the cytosol. mutations in nsts are associated with widespread defects in glycosylation leading to developmental diseases in mammals and loss or attenuated infectivity of human pathogens  <cit> .

in parasitic protozoa, the role of nsts has been investigated in leishmania spp.  <cit> , t. brucei  <cit>  and toxoplasma gondi  <cit> . in l. major, knockout of the gdp-mannose  transporter lpg <dig> resulted in mutants deficient in cell-surface phosphoglycan molecules displaying attenuated virulence in mice  <cit> . recently, four nsts from t. brucei  were characterized  <cit> . silencing and knockout experiments of tbnst <dig>  which transports udp-n-acetylglucosamine , udp-n-acetylgalactosamine  and gdp-man, resulted in glycosylation defects, but no impairment of infectivity was observed, likely due to redundancy in function.

in this study, we have identified a udp-glcnac transporter from t. cruzi  by yeast complementation in vivo. we show that tcnst <dig> is localized to the golgi apparatus and that the gene is likely expressed during the parasite life cycle and in vitro metacyclogenesis—a process by which epimastigote forms differentiate into infective metacyclic trypomastigotes. this is the first experimentally characterized nst in t. cruzi, for which there is relatively little information regarding glycoconjugate biosynthesis.

RESULTS

aeleven putative t. cruzi nsts were identified in genedb by perfoming blastp searches using characterized nsts of different organisms as queries. for nine of the genes both haplotypes could be identified based on similarity and synteny. the hybrid diploid cl brener strain is composed of haplotypes named esmeraldo-like and non-esmeraldo-like. genes  derived from esmeraldo-like haplotypes are indicated in parentheses

due to the hybrid nature of the diploid cl brener strain  <cit> , both haplotypes of nine of the genes could be identified based on similarity and synteny . the alleles in each pair are at least  <dig> % identical to each other at the amino acid level and, with two exceptions, code for proteins of identical or similar size . the genes tcclb. <dig>  and tcclb. <dig> , however, have an extended amino terminus when compared to their respective alleles. comparison of the predicted protein products with the corresponding homologues in t. cruzi sylvio ×10/ <dig>  a non-hybrid strain whose draft genome sequence was made available more recently  <cit> , and also with the putative homologues in t. brucei and leishmania spp., suggests that for both genes the amino terminal extension results from annotation errors .

t. cruzi udp-glcnac transporter
it is not possible to determine the substrate specificity of a given nst by analysis of its amino acid sequence  <cit> . to identify udp-glcnac transporters, we used a yeast complementation approach in which a kluyveromyces lactis mutant deficient in the golgi transport of udp-glcnac was used  <cit> . this mutant has been used for the identification of udp-glcnac transporters from canine cells  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit>  and t. brucei  <cit> . complementation assays are based on the less intense binding of the gs-ii lectin from griffonia simplicifolia, which specifically recognizes terminal glcnac residues, to the mutant cell surface.

although sequence similarity is not particularly useful for substrate specificity prediction, we used the udp-glcnac transporters from t. brucei  <cit> , a closely related parasite, to restrict our candidate genes. based on phylogenetic analysis between the putative t. cruzi transporters and known nsts from different organisms , the genes tcclb. <dig> , tcclb. <dig> , tcclb. <dig>  and tcclb. <dig>  code for the closest transporters to tbnst <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. these genes, indicated by arrows in fig.  <dig>  were then used for the complementation assays in k. lactis.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of nsts from different organisms and the putative t. cruzi nsts. experimental characterized substrates are indicated in parentheses. t. cruzi nsts used for complementation assays in k. lactis are indicated by arrows. sequences were aligned using clustalx <dig>  and the tree was constructed with mega <dig> . statistical method: neighbor-joining. model: p-distance. number of bootstraps replications:  <dig>  atudp-galt <dig>  a. thaliana udp-galt <dig> ; cegdp-fuc, c. elegans gdp-fuc ; cec03h <dig> , c. elegans c03h <dig>  ; cngmt <dig>  c. neoformans gmt <dig> ; dmgfr, d. melanogaster gfr ; hsslc35c <dig>  homo sapiens slc35c <dig> ; hsslc35a2-hugt <dig>  h. sapiens slc35a2-hugt <dig> ; hsslc35a <dig>  h. sapiens slc35a <dig> ; kludp-glcnac, k. lactis udp-glcnac ; lmpg <dig>  l. major lpg <dig> ; lmlpg5a, l. major lpg5a ; lmlpg5b, l. major lpg5b ; scvrg <dig>  s. cerevisiae vrg <dig> ; tbnst <dig>  t. brucei nst <dig> ; tbnst <dig>  t. brucei nst <dig> ; tbnst <dig>  t. brucei nst <dig> ; tbnst <dig>  t. brucei nst <dig> . gi numbers are indicated in parentheses



only the transporter encoded by the tcclb. <dig>  gene, tcnst <dig>  could rescue the wild-type phenotype . restoration of gsii lectin binding to levels similar to those of wild-type cells was observed in approximately  <dig> % of cells transfected with tcnst <dig>  similar results have been observed for the heterologous expression of nsts in yeast, and it is likely related to the expression of nonfunctional transporters . the mean fluorescence intensity values are presented in fig. 2b. for cells expressing tcnst <dig>  the fluorescence intensity corresponded to approximately  <dig> % of wild-type levels, a finding that is in agreement with half of the cells not restoring gs-ii lectin binding. as a positive control, we used the k. lactis udp-glcnac transporter , whose activity is deficient in the yeast mutant strain. the expression of the other genes in the k. lactis mutant cells did not increase binding of the lectin . expression of these genes in k. lactis was analyzed by western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against the histidine tail inserted at the carboxyl-terminal of the transporters. however, our results regarding level of expression and apparent molecular weight were not conclusive . therefore, the incapacity of tcclb <dig>  tcclb <dig> and tcclb <dig> to complement the k. lactis mutant could be due to lack of proper expression in the yeast cells.fig.  <dig> identification of a udp-glcnac transporter  of t. cruzi by in vivo complementation assays. k. lactis mutant  cells were transfected with tcnst <dig>  the k. lactis udp-glcnac transporter  or empty vector . wild-type k. lactis cells were included in the analysis for comparison. cells were grown as described in the methods section. after labeling with gs-ii lectin , yeast cells were separated by flow cytometry in a facs canto ii . a representative histograms showing lectin binding transfected cells. b mean fluorescence intensities of a representative experiment in triplicate. error bars represent the standard deviations. * p <  <dig> 



the tcclb. <dig>  gene and its allele tcclb. <dig>  are both composed of  <dig> nucleotides and code for a 313-amino acid polypeptide. there is only one amino acid difference between them, in which an asparagine residue is replaced by a serine  in tcclb. <dig> . sequencing of the gene from t. cruzi clone dm28c, which was used in this work, revealed a protein identical to its homologue in t. cruzi sylvio ×10/ <dig>  encoded by the gene tcsylvio_ <dig>  this protein differ by three amino acids to that encoded by the gene tcclb. <dig>  in t. cruzi cl brener .

many nsts are multisubstrate transporters, including the recently characterized t. brucei transporters. tbnst <dig> is the closest t. brucei transporter to tcnst <dig>  and it can transport udp-glcnac, udp-galnac and gdp-man. next, we decided to test whether tcnst <dig> would also be able to transport gdp-man because mannose residues are important for t. cruzi glycoconjugates . the capacity to transport gdp-man was assessed by complementation of a saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant partially deficient in gdp-man transport   <cit>  using a fusion protein tcnst1-v <dig>  as shown in fig. 3a, tcnst <dig> could not restore growth of the yeast cells in the presence of the anionic dye congo red. to rule out the possibility that tcnst <dig> was not expressed in the yeast cells, western blot analyses were carried out using an anti-v <dig> monoclonal antibody. tcnst <dig> is visualized in total protein extracts of cells transfected with the vector encoding tcnst1-v <dig> but not in cells transfected with the empty vector .fig.  <dig> tcnst <dig> cannot complement a s. cerevisiae mutant strain deficient in gdp-man transport. a
s. cerevisiae strain ndy <dig> was transfected with tcnst1-v <dig>  the s. cerevisiae gdp-man vrg4p transporter  or empty vector . wild-type s. cerevisiae  cells were included in the analysis for comparison. transfected cells were grown to exponential phase in liquid cultures of scm-ura, adjusted to an od of approximately one  and submitted to ten-fold serial dilution . cells were then inoculated on solid agar plates containing yp plus  <dig> % galactose and  <dig>  μg/ml congo red. growth was assessed after 4 days at 30 °c. b western blot analysis of strain ndy <dig> transfected with empty vector  or tcnst1-v <dig> . tcnst <dig> expression was detected with a mouse anti-v <dig> antibody. expression of histone  <dig> was used as an internal control



tcnst <dig> subcellular localization and gene expression
that tcnst <dig> could restore udp-glcnac transport in the k. lactis mutant suggested the golgi apparatus as its probable subcellular localization. to investigate this hypothesis in t. cruzi, we used a chimeric protein in which green fluorescent protein  was fused to the n-terminus of tcnst <dig>  after transfection and selection of neomycin-resistant cells, t. cruzi epimastigotes were analyzed by fluorescence microscope. transfected epimastigotes with the gfp-tcnst <dig> fusion protein displayed a dot signal at the anterior region of the parasite while fluorescence emitted by transfectants expressing only gfp-flag  was distributed through the cytoplasm. wild-type cells had little intrinsic fluorescence . next we used a monoclonal antibody against gfp to detect expression of gfp-tcnst <dig> in total extracts of epimastigotes. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the transporter fused to gfp is present in transfected epimastigotes but not in wild-type cells. the golgi localization of tcnst <dig> was confirmed by co-localization with tchip, a putative t. cruzi zdhhc palmitoyl transferase recently shown to be localized to the golgi apparatus  <cit> . a clear punctual signal in close contact with the kinetoplast, as would be expected for a golgi resident protein , was shown to co-localize with tchip .fig.  <dig> tcnst <dig> is localized to the golgi apparatus. t. cruzi epimastigotes were transfected with a fusion construct in which tcnst <dig> was tagged at the amino terminus with gfp . tagged tcnst <dig> was localized by fluorescence microscopy after staining with anti-gfp  and anti-tchip, a golgi marker . kinetoplasts  and nuclei  were stained with dapi . secondary antibody controls showed no fluorescence signal 



tcnst <dig> expression was analyzed by semi-quantitative rt-pcr along the life cycle of t. cruzi and during the process of metacyclogenesis in vitro, in which epimastigotes in the late exponential phase are differentiated into metacyclics under nutritional stress in a chemically defined differentiation medium  <cit> . in this medium, called tau3aag, epimastigotes adhere to a substrate and are released as metacyclics after approximately 100 h. according to the results shown in fig.  <dig>  tcnst <dig> mrna is present in all four major life forms of t. cruzi and in intermediate forms during differentiation from epimastigotes to metacyclics. while post-transcriptional control of gene expression is particularly important in trypanosomatids, the presence of mrna suggests that the transporter may be expressed in all life forms of the parasite.fig.  <dig> tcnst <dig> is expressed at the mrna level in all life forms of t. cruzi and during metacyclogenesis in vitro. rt-pcr analysis of tcnst <dig> mrna expression in epimastigotes , cell-culture-derived trypomastigotes , amastigotes , metacyclics  and intermediary forms during metacyclogenesis: epimastigotes in the late exponential phase , epimastigotes under nutritional stress  and adhered epimastigotes . expression of the 60s ribosomal protein l <dig> was used as an internal control . aliquots of all samples were pooled together and subjected to reverse transcription without reverse transcriptase 



discussion
we have identified a family of eleven putative nsts from t. cruzi . these putative transporters show an overall structural similarity with other members of the nst family. syntenic homologues to the tcclb. <dig>  and tcclb. <dig>  genes are present in leishmania spp.  but not in t. brucei. for all the other putative t. cruzi nsts, there is a clear syntenic homologue in t. brucei. as has been noted by capul et al.  <cit> , an interesting role for transporters shared by leishmania spp and t. cruzi involves udp-galactofuranose , which is present in both trypanosomatids but not in t. brucei. according to our phylogenetic analyses and the tritrypdb, two t. cruzi nsts, tcclb. <dig>  and tcclb. <dig> , have no clear homologues in t. brucei or leishmania. similarly, putative roles for these transporters could be the transport of udp-xylose  and udp-rhamnopyranose , which are synthesized only by t. cruzi  <cit> .

eight nucleotide sugars have been identified in t. cruzi by spectrometry  <cit> , gdp-man, udp-glcnac, udp-glucose , udp-gal, udp-galf, udp-xyl, udp-rha and gdp-fucose. accordingly, the corresponding sugars have been identified in t. cruzi glycoconjugates  <cit> . because we have identified eleven putative nsts, and assuming that they are all functional, redundancy likely exists between these transporters, as has been reported in other organisms. in fact, the four recently characterized t. brucei nsts can transport udp-glcnac, two of them  transport udp-gal, and the other two  transport gdp-man.

tcnst <dig> showed the greatest values of similarity  to the t. brucei tbnst <dig> transporter , the arabidopsis thaliana udp-gal transporter udp-galt <dig>  and the aspergillus fumigatus udp-galactofuranose transporter glfb . the k. lactis udp-glcnac transporter, whose deficient activity in the yeast mutant strain was compensated by tcnst <dig>  is a more distantly related transporter , constituting another example of the difficulty involved in determining the substrate specificity of nsts based on primary sequence analysis.

we also tested the capacity of tcnst <dig> to transport gdp-man in yeast cells. the complementation test was negative . tcnst <dig> was shown to be expressed in the yeast cells by western blotting, but we cannot rule out that the transporter is not functional in s. cerevisiae by mislocalization. therefore, even though our results suggest that gdp-man is not a substrate for tcnst <dig> in the parasite it is not a definite conclusion. a conserved galnk motif associated with binding to gdp-man was identified in the s. cerevisiae vrg <dig> gdp-man transporter  <cit> . the same motif is present in the gdp-man transporters of cryptococcus neoformans , t. brucei  and l. major . interestingly, in tbnst <dig>  which transports gdp-man, and tcnst <dig>  this motif is less conserved, but a leucine residue, which is important for vrg <dig> function at physiological levels  <cit> , is present in tbnst <dig>  but not tcnst <dig> 

nsts are mainly localized to the golgi apparatus. however, in trypanosomatids, nucleotide sugars are supposed to be synthesized in glycosomes  <cit> . it was important, then, to investigate the subcellular localization of tcnst <dig>  our results  suggest a clear golgi localization with no indication of the presence of the transporter in glycosomes.

udp-glcnac is an important substrate for the three trypanosomatids discussed here because it is required for the synthesis of both the conserved core of gpi anchors and the oligosaccharide core of n-glycans  <cit> . in t. brucei, in which the synthesis of udp-glcnac is essential for parasite survival, the pool of udp-glcnac inside the golgi lumen is necessary for the synthesis of n-acetyllactosamine  <cit> . in t. cruzi, the golgi content of udp-glcnac is important for the synthesis of o-linked glycans in mucins, which starts with the attachment of glcnac, from udp-glcnac, to a ser or thr residue via an α-n-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . therefore, the transport of udp-glcnac across the golgi membrane is essential for the proper synthesis of t. cruzi mucins.

CONCLUSIONS
tcnst <dig> is a udp-glcnac transporter specifically localized to the golgi apparatus. due to its specificity and subcellular localization, it is tempting to speculate that tcnst <dig> may have a role on the synthesis of t. cruzi mucins. moreover, the expression of tcnst <dig>  at the mrna level, in all life forms of t. cruzi is in agreement with the expression of mucins throughout the life cycle of the parasite. loss-of-function studies of this transporter are underway to unravel its role in t. cruzi glycosylation.
