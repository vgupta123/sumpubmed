BACKGROUND
the actin cytoskeleton is highly dynamic, constantly being remodelled in living cells and may become dysfunctional in various kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy   <cit> . in vitro <cit>  and in vivo <cit>  studies have shown disruption of the cytoskeleton in renal mesangial cells exposed to high extracellular glucose and growth factors. similarly, the migration of epithelial cells, such as those undergoing epithelial to mesenchymal transition, is dependent on the reorganisation of the cytoskeleton. in vitro, actin mediated contractile changes are often modelled using cell migration responses; migration being characterised by the same polarisation, protrusion, adhesion and extensive dynamic cytoskeletal and microtubular reorganisation seen in disease related cytoskeletal dysfunction  <cit> ; and regulated by complex signalling networks initiated and integrated by integrins and other receptors  <cit> .

in the context of dn, it is accepted that both transforming growth factor-β  and one of its downstream effectors connective tissue growth factor  play roles in regulating the pathogenesis of this fibrotic kidney disease. ccn <dig> has been reported to regulate tgfβ superfamily signalling in various contexts including renal mesangial/epithelial cell dysfunction  <cit>  and dn  <cit> ; coordinate expression of tgfβ and ccn <dig> has been demonstrated in glomerulonephritis and dn  <cit>  and the cooperative nature of tgfβ and ccn <dig> in the promotion of fibrosis in animal models has been established  <cit> .

the role of ccn <dig> and tgfβ in the modulation of mesangial cell migratory response was first described by blom and colleagues  <cit>  and subsequently characterised as being dependent on erk map kinase, protein kinase b and protein kinase c  <cit> . intriguingly, the interplay between these factors and the migratory capacity of the cells was altered in the presence of high glucose levels, attributed to changes in cell polarisation caused by dysregulation of the pkc-ζ/gsk3β signalling axis  <cit> . we previously reported that the combination of tgfβ and ccn <dig> induce a gene expression profile characterised by the differential expression of a unique subset of genes in human mesangial cells  <cit> . in the present study we interrogated this subset of genes and identified a role for the transcription factors creb and e2f <dig> in mediating altered actin and cytoskeletal related dynamics. this transcriptional programme is evidenced by a non-vectorial migration profile in vitro when mesangial cells are treated with both growth factors, reflecting an altered cell phenotype that may be considered profibrotic and hypertrophic. the data from this study provide useful information for the characterisation of cytoskeletal dysfunction in fibrotic disorders associated with increased expression of tgfβ and ccn <dig>  <cit> .

RESULTS
co-treatment of mesangial cells with tgfβ and ccn <dig> results in erk dependent inhibition of migration
in the search for molecular linkers between haemodynamic dysregulation, the renin-angiotensin system and renal scarring, tgfβ expression was found to be upregulated in glomerular diseases including experimental glomerulonephritis  <cit>  and experimental and human dn within the mesangium  <cit> . increased glomerular expression of ccn <dig> has also been reported in a variety of human glomerulopathies, including iga nephropathy, focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis as well as diabetic nephropathy  <cit> . increased ccn <dig> expression has been documented in experimental models of diabetic glomerulosclerosis  <cit> ; in vitro studies have shown that ccn <dig> is induced in hmcs by high glucose, ages, tgfβ and ros  <cit> . in the streptozotocin  diabetic mouse model, upregulated expression of ccn <dig> has been found to be primarily contained to the podocyte in the immediate phases after induction of diabetes  <cit> ; stz mice that transgenically over-express ccn <dig> specifically in the podocyte developed more severe proteinuria and mesangial expansion than their control  littermates  <cit> . podocyte derived ccn <dig> has also recently been proposed to have a paracrine effect on mesangial cells resulting in augmented profibrotic signalling and matrix accumulation independent of active tgfβ  <cit> . co-ordinate expression of tgfβ and ccn <dig> has been previously described  <cit> ; a potentially complex interplay between autocrine and paracrine factors is likely present in the glomerular microenvironment and contributes to the development of chronic fibrosis. in a recent multi-disease study of the contribution of tgfβ and ccn <dig> to the development of fibrosis in the kidney, liver and lung, wang and colleagues demonstrated that ccn <dig> was both sufficient and necessary to initiate fibrosis in the presence of tgfβ, and vice versa  <cit> .

in the context of dn, dysregulation of the cytoskeleton is a feature associated with the response of myofibroblast like cells to changes in the composition of extracellular matrices. modelling of migration in cells provides a useful insight into the effects of tgfβ and ccn <dig> on the organisation of the cytoskeleton. in human mesangial cells  treated with tgfβ or ccn <dig>  the number of cells migrating is increased, in line with previous observations  <cit> . however, co-treatment of hmcs with both growth factors is sufficient to prevent the migration of cells , with this effect found independent of altered proliferation . it has previously been reported that decreased activation of canonical smad signalling in cells treated with both tgfβ and ccn <dig> is associated with increased non-canonical signalling by erk map kinase  <cit> . in cells treated with both tgfβ and ccn <dig>  inhibition of mek/erk with the selective inhibitor pd- <dig> was sufficient to rescue the migration of hmcs , again independently of altered proliferation , suggesting a role for erk in this process.

pathway analysis of genes differentially expressed in cells treated with tgfβ and ccn2
altered gene expression in hmcs treated with tgfβ, ccn <dig> or both together was previously determined by gene array  <cit> . tgfβ and ccn <dig> together differentially regulated over  <dig> genes in hmcs that were not regulated by either growth factor alone . ccn <dig> on its own only regulated the expression of approximately  <dig> genes, supporting the hypothesis that this growth factor plays a major role in the integration of signalling by other molecules rather than ccn <dig> itself regulating gene expression. using ingenuity pathway analysis   we identified that co-treatment of hmcs with tgfβ and ccn <dig>  resulted in augmented expression of genes associated with molecular and cellular functions including cell growth and proliferation, while also enhancing nephrotoxicity associated pathways including proliferation and hypertrophy associated genes . analysis of annotated functional pathways  found a decrease in genes associated with canonical tgfβ/bmp signalling and camp signalling with an increase in genes regulated by erk map kinase signalling; supporting a role for divergent activation of canonical and non-canonical signalling in the mesangial cell expansion.

identification of an altered transcriptional regulatory signature – e2f <dig> and creb are over and under-represented in hmcs co-treated with tgfβ and ccn2
we hypothesised that the differential gene expression profile seen in co-treated hmcs would be dependent on a change in the transcriptional regulatory network of the cells. we interrogated the promoters of the differentially regulated genes to determine common transcription factor binding sites  in the 500 bp region upstream of the transcription start site. co-inertia analysis of these promoters identified tfbss that were over or under-represented relative to control hmcs . some  <dig> tfbss were found increased in occurrence in genes common to hmcs treated with either tgfβ or tgfβ and ccn <dig> together, while  <dig> tfbss were found to be decreased in occurrence. a subset of transcription factors were found to be uniquely regulated by tgfβ and ccn2; two of these transcription factors were selected for further characterisation – e2f <dig>  as the sole transcription factor over-represented by co-treatment and creb, with an established response to tgfβ and as a key component of camp signalling that was identified by pathway analysis to be negatively regulated in cells treated with tgfβ and ccn <dig>  pathway analysis of both transcription factors confirmed altered expression of associated genes in cells treated with both tgfβ and ccn <dig> versus tgfβ alone .

validation of transcription factor signature – co-treatment of hmcs with tgfβ and ccn <dig> results in decreased active creb levels and increased e2f <dig> activity, which is dependent on erk signalling
members of the e2f family play essential roles in the regulation of proliferation by stimulation of s-phase genes  <cit>  and overexpression of e2f <dig> overcomes the inhibition of cell growth by tgfβ at mid-g <dig> phase  <cit> . in diabetes, e2f <dig> negatively regulates growth of mature pancreatic cells and maintains differentiated pancreatic cell phenotypes  <cit> ; in renal disease, increased e2f <dig> has been found in proliferating glomeruli in human iga nephropathy  <cit> . in the kidney, creb is reported as a positive and negative regulator of gene expression in disease pathophysiology. in tubular cells it transduces pro-survival signals after oxidant stress  <cit>  and regulates hexosamine induced fibronectin synthesis in mesangial cells  <cit> . high extracellular glucose and tgfβ stimulate fibronectin production in mesangial cells by camp/creb  <cit> ; use of anti tgfβ antibodies has been reported to decrease creb phosphorylation and hypertrophy in diabetic glomeruli  <cit> . treatment of hmcs, with tgfβ or ccn <dig>  decreased pcreb levels, co-treatment of cells consistently decreased the levels of activated creb further . neither tgfβ nor ccn <dig> altered the localisation of creb within the cell, suggesting intermediate transduction of the regulatory signal to already localised nuclear creb. tgfβ and ccn <dig> also increased expression of activated e2f <dig>  and transcriptional activity of an e2f <dig> promoter containing luciferase reporter , demonstrating a transcriptional consequence for genes containing the tfbs. with the preceding observation that inhibition of mek/erk signalling restored the ability of hmcs to migrate when treated with tgfβ and ccn <dig>  we investigated whether this was associated with the regulation of e2f1/creb. it is well established that many growth factors can activate creb via phosphorylation at its ser- <dig> site, with this effect being mediated by protein kinases including mek/erk/p <dig> and rsk  <cit> . attenuation of erk expression in hmcs with the mek inhibitor pd- <dig>  was therefore unsurprisingly found not to alter the phosphorylation state of creb . however, inhibition of erk both restricted the activation of e2f <dig>  as well as the activation of e2f <dig> luciferase ; these data suggest a role for erk in the regulation of e2f <dig> 

identification of an actin-related gene expression profile with stratified occurrence of e2f <dig> and creb tfbss
creb and e2f <dig> tfbss were under and over-represented  in hmcs treated with both tgfβ and ccn2; erk inhibition restored migration and inhibited e2f <dig>  therefore we examined the role of genes associated with actin cytoskeletal reorganisation and migration containing creb and e2f <dig> tfbss. gene ontology  annotation was used to address this and extract a subset of genes containing the go term ‘actin’ which were subsequently examined for creb and e2f <dig> sites in the 5000 bp region upstream of the transcription start site. interestingly, the occurrence of creb and e2f <dig> sites varied by gene expression profile: genes that decreased in expression in co-treated cells relative to control cells contained more creb binding sites, while positively regulated genes contained more e2f <dig> binding sites . this data suggests a role for both transcription factors in the altered migratory responses seen upon co-treatment. the table in additional file  <dig> summarises the physiological functions ascribed to the actin cytoskeletal genes found to be differentially regulated. these genes include a number of master regulators associated with cell structural dynamics including adhesion, migration, cytoskeletal reorganisation and actin dynamics. in dn, the expression of both tgfβ  <cit>  and ccn <dig>  <cit>  are increased; altered actin and cytoskeletal dynamics is a feature of the disease  <cit> . data from the european renal cdna bank  illustrates that genes associated with actin reorganisation are altered in dn ; it seems likely that the altered actin cytoskeletal dynamic profile observed in vitro is re-capitulated in disease.

differential regulation of hypertrophic genes in hmcs treated with tgfβ and ccn2
the earliest gross pathological renal feature of diabetes mellitus is generalised renal growth  <cit> . tubuloepithelial hypertrophy and tubular basement membrane thickening occur early while glomerular growth processes have been found to always precede glomerulosclerosis in experimental models of dn  <cit> . the association between growth and fibrogenesis may be due to the fact that similar networks of growth factors and cytokines that induce cellular hypertrophy also stimulate extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition  <cit> . tgfβ is one of the principal effectors of glomerular hypertrophy, with increased levels of the growth factor found early in multiple models of dn, in parallel with increased kidney weight  <cit> . in line with its role as a mediator of tgfβ, ccn <dig> is also reported to transduce hypertrophic tgfβ signalling  <cit> . with tgfβ and ccn <dig> being reported as both pro-migratory and pro-hypertrophic, we hypothesised that the altered phenotype may represent an enhanced hypertrophic response. using ingenuity pathway analysis, we extracted a panel of hypertrophy associated genes differentially regulated by tgfβ and ccn <dig>  but inconsistent expression profiles provided inconclusive evidence supporting a role for hypertrophy in the change in migratory response .

co-treatment driven cdc <dig> activation and signalling in hmcs and in disease
cdc <dig>  a member of the rho family of gtpases, has been shown to play a role in cell motility and migration  <cit> . cdc <dig> is active towards the front end of migrating cells; inhibition or global activation of cdc <dig> results in disrupted directionality of migration  <cit> . to determine if an alteration of cdc <dig> occurred in cells treated with tgfβ and ccn <dig>  the activity of the protein was determined using an active cdc <dig> pull-down assay . in cells treated with tgfβ and ccn <dig>  cdc <dig> activation was increased ; in addition the phosphorylation of the cdc <dig> effector kinases pak1/ <dig> was also increased . pathway analysis of co-treatment regulated genes identified differential expression of interacting partners of cdc <dig> and pak <dig> , suggesting the altered migratory capacity in co-treated cells may be associated with differential cdc42/pak signalling. analysis of ercb data identified a cohort of cdc <dig> interacting proteins that were altered in expression between control and dn patients , supporting a disease role for this signalling context.

CONCLUSIONS
the data shown here examines the transcriptional basis of how tgfβ and ccn <dig> together alter the migratory capacity of hmcs, determining that there is a role for creb and e2f <dig> in regulating the expression of actin related genes that contribute towards the ability of cells to move. from their known functions in the regulation of cell cycle transition  <cit> , hypertrophy  <cit>  and proliferation  <cit> , it is likely that these functions are also part of the mechanism by which creb and e2f <dig> play roles in cell migration; in hmcs these processes were identified from gene expression data to be modified by the presence of both tgfβ and ccn <dig>  a further role for cdc <dig> as a major effector of polarisation and cytoskeletal organisation was also found, with expression of the active form of this protein being regulated by tgfβ and ccn <dig> together. in the context of dn, a better understanding of the interplay between ccn <dig>  a known effector of cytoskeletal reorganisation and tgfβ will undoubtedly enhance our understanding of the dysregulation of actin cytoskeletal processes in this kidney disease.
