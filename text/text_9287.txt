BACKGROUND
living organisms store carbon as soluble  or insoluble  polysaccharides. starch is a storage polysaccharide made of α- <dig> -glucans with α- <dig>  branches  <cit> . it is composed of two polymer fractions  <cit> : the moderately branched amylopectin, forming the semi-crystalline backbone of the starch granule  <cit> ; and amylose, a fraction with very few branches, which is embedded inside the amylopectin matrix. the branching pattern of amylopectin is distinctively asymmetrical, allowing for the close packing of intertwined chains into helical structures that crystallise and collapse by dehydration, hence forming the starch granule  <cit> .

glycogen is widespread across archaea, eubacteria and eukaryotes  <cit> . in contrast, starch is found mostly in lineages derived from primary plastid endosymbiosis: the archaeplastida. starch is also occasionally found in some unicellular marine diazotrophic cyanobacteria and several secondary endosymbiotic lineages  <cit> . a majority of the enzymes in the starch biosynthesis pathway  are derived from members of the eukaryotic glycogen metabolism pathway. a few enzymes however display a prokaryotic phylogenetic affiliation. among them, adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase and granule bound starch synthase i were acquired through endosymbiotic gene transfer from the plastid ancestor. additionally, isoamylases and soluble starch synthases iii-iv were transmitted by lateral gene transfer from intracellular chlamydiae pathogens  <cit> . finally archaeplastidal pullulanases are distinctively polyphyletic and were acquired from diverse unidentified proteobacterial sources.

it is generally acknowledged that the cyanobacterial and eukaryotic pathways of storage polysaccharide merged during plastid endosymbiosis to generate an ancient cytosolic starch biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . after or during metabolic transformation of the protoplastid into a true organelle, the archaeplastida diverged into three lineages: the glaucophyta , the rhodophyceae  and the chloroplastida   <cit> . while the ancient cytosolic localization of storage polysaccharides was maintained in red algae and glaucophytes, the green lineage redirected the whole sbp to the plastid stroma as it diverged from the other archaeplastida lineages  <cit> .

just as in green algae, in monocots and dicots the sbp involves a complex network of genes. however in monocots, adp-glucose synthesis partitioning varies between source and storage tissues . indeed adp-glucose synthesis occurs both in the amyloplast and the cytosol of the cereal storage endosperm while it is otherwise confined to plastids in the leaves. similarly the phosphoglucomutase enzyme  is present exclusively in the plastid of photosynthetic tissue but in both cytosol and plastid of storage tissue . these pathways have been the basis of extensive physiological studies but few of them have explored the processes that govern their shaping. this issue is particularly relevant in the green lineage for which the sbp has been redirected to plastids and gene duplications have largely contributed to its organization and diversification.

most genes involved in the sbp are members of multigenic families that have emerged from duplications during the complex archaeplastida evolutionary history  <cit> . gene duplications in the sbp have occurred at different times during archaeplastida evolution. some of them had already occurred in the archaeplastida ancestor prior to divergence of chloroplastida from rhodophyceae and glaucophyta, and possibly prior to plastid endosymbiosis, while others have occurred after the divergence of the three archaeplastida lineages. within chloroplastida, redirection of the sbp from the cytosol to the evolving chloroplast was facilitated by gene duplications. finally some duplications have occurred recently such as the duplication of granule bound starch synthase  within the poaceae family.

interestingly, ball and morell  <cit>  reviewed the evolutionary history of duplications in three gene families involved in the sbp , and have shown no functional redundancy among paralogs. similarly, yan et al. <cit>  reported  <dig> sbp genes in maize  and  <dig> in rice  and found that a substantial proportion of genes diverged in structure and/or expression pattern following whole genome duplications. altogether, these results indicate that the sbp set up in plants is linked to the persistence of duplicated genes via functional specialization. the sbp set up therefore stands as an interesting framework to explore models of long-term persistence of duplicated genes and their contribution to pathway evolution.

three models of persistence of duplicated genes are commonly encountered in the literature. the duplication-degeneration-complementation  sub-functionalization model, first proposed by force et al. <cit> , posits that the paralogs evolve complementary sub-functions, overall maintaining the ancestral function  <cit> . the escape from adaptive conflict  sub-functionalization model proposes the specialization of duplicated genes in two distinct functions originally fulfilled by the same ancestral gene  <cit> . under this model, duplication resolves a conflict residing in the incapacity of improving simultaneously the two functions because of detrimental pleiotropic effects  <cit> . finally, the neofunctionalization  model  <cit>  postulates that one paralog is recruited to fulfil a new function while the other preserves the ancestral function  <cit> . variants of this last model have been proposed to resolve the so-called ohno’s dilemma  <cit> , i.e. loss of the neutrally evolving paralog before acquisition of a rare beneficial mutation  <cit> . for instance, the innovation-amplification-divergence  model  <cit>  posits the evolution of a specialized enzyme from a progenitor enzyme displaying one or a range of promiscuous activities in addition to its primary function. these activities provide the substrate upon which natural selection can act and ultimately lead to functional divergence. in both the eac and iad models, several activities are assumed to exist prior to duplication. the specific resolution of ohno’s dilemma by the iad model resides in the fact that changes in the ecological niche makes one or several pre-existing minor activities valuable. selection will increase promiscuous activities, allowing maintenance of the paralog during its neo-functionalization  <cit> .

these models differ in terms of selective pressures and molecular evolution rate following gene duplication  <cit> , the latter being generally estimated using ω, the ratio of non-synonymous  over synonymous  substitution rates  <cit> . hence, the ddc model predicts that the two paralogs evolve under selective neutrality  while accumulating complementary mutations leading to a loss of function. under the eac model, both paralogs evolve under positive selection  allowing optimization of different sub-functions. in the neo-f and iad models, one paralog evolves under positive selection  as it is recruited for a new function or a previously neutral minor function, while the other paralog evolves under selective constraint  to preserve the ancestral function.

the neo-f model has been clearly illustrated through several examples of gain of function after duplication, such as the gain of an new enzyme function in glycosinolate synthesis in boechera <cit> , the acquisition of the glutamate dehydrogenase gene in human and apes, that of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene in drosophila, and those of gonadal paralogs of the pig cytochrome gene . iad illustrations come from the microbial literature, which offers several examples of new function evolution from the promiscuous activities of an ancestral enzyme . the distinction between the two neo-functionalization models, neo-f and iad, is challenging because it requires a knowledge of the promiscuous functions fulfilled by the ancestral gene – before duplication. similarly, distinguishing between the two sub-functionalization models, ddc and eac, is difficult because both models rely on the partitioning of the ancestral function. so far, most of reported sub-functionalization cases have been interpreted in the light of the popular ddc model while the eac model has received little support in the literature. des marais and rausher  <cit>  identified clear evidence of eac from signs of adaptive evolution on two dihydroflavonol reductase paralogs in ipomea and further suggest that evolution under the eac model may not be uncommon.

the fate of duplicated genes has been explored for one of the sbp enzymes among angiosperms, the adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase   <cit> . in archaeplastida, this protein is composed of two sub-units  encoded by paralogous genes originating from multiple duplication events. patterns consistent with repeated sub-functionalization under the eac model have been described in the evolution of the agpase large sub-unit, leading to enzyme specialization for sink versus source tissues, as well as a particular agpase adaptation in grass endosperm  <cit> . contrastingly, the sequence of the small sub-unit paralogs revealed evidence neither of sub-functionalization nor positive selection during angiosperms evolution, in spite of numerous duplication events. the small sub-unit has evolved under strong constraints, preventing the acquisition of new or modified functions  <cit> . additionally, corbi et al. revealed signs of coevolution among amino acid residues of the small sub-unit interaction domain  <cit>  that likely also resulted from the strong evolutionary constraints placed on the agpase small sub-unit.

in the present study, we propose to extend the analysis of the evolutionary pattern following duplication events that occurred along the sbp evolution in angiosperms, to six gene families encoding sbp enzymes. we rely on phylogenetic approaches coupled with tests on the rates of evolution along branches and clades to assess selective processes that are responsible for the maintenance of paralogs along this pathway. more specifically, we compare observed patterns of evolution to those predicted by the ddc, the eac, and the neo-f/iad models. we discuss our results in the frame of the sbp evolution.

RESULTS
we studied the evolution of six gene families encoding enzymes of the sbp within angiosperms. for each family we identified paralogous genes maintained after duplication events that we matched to known compartmental or functional specialization. we further estimated the evolutionary rates in branches and clades emerging from such duplications to test whether accelerated evolution of paralogs has contributed to the evolution of this metabolic pathway. patterns of evolutionary rates along branches were informative and provided support for distinct models of evolution of duplicated genes in the sbp pathway. in contrast, when performing pairwise comparisons of average ω values of clades emerging from gene duplication , we found that all comparisons were significant . furthermore, ω values among clades varied between  <dig> and  <dig>  consistent with purifying selection. overall the clade model therefore did not detect positive selection and offered no power to discriminate among models. we therefore chose to focus primarily on the branch-site model in the presentation of our results.

paralogs with cytosolic vs. plastidic specialization
both starch phosphorylase  and pgm  phylogenies of gene families exhibited two groups of paralogs emerging from a duplication event  that occurred before angiosperm radiation. hence, each group of paralogs present sequences from selaginella moellendorffii and/or physcomitrella patens for pho and pgm gene families. each group of paralogs displayed a cytosolic or plastidial expression specialization following d <dig> . we therefore tested for signatures of accelerated evolution along branches a and/or b emerging from duplication d <dig> in both pho and pgm.

pho exhibited positive selection and/or constraint relaxation in both branches d1a and d1b . evolution rate estimates revealed that about 15% and 6% sites– for branch d1a and branch d1b, respectively – evolved under positive selection. using the beb  method we identified  <dig> and  <dig> sites in branches d1a and d1b respectively, with high posterior probability to have evolved under positive selection .

positive selection and constraint relaxation was observed in branches a and b for pgm . in branch d1a, about 9% of the sites were detected under positive selection with an ω value of  <dig>  while in branch d1b, about 13% of the sites were detected under positive selection . beb revealed  <dig> and  <dig> sites under positive selection were identified in branches a and b, respectively .

among the  <dig> sites detected under positive selection in branch d1b ,  <dig> of them  have a large posterior probability  to have evolved under positive selection. at position e <dig> , a glutamic acid  was inferred in the ancestral sequence while, among plastidic paralogs, we found predominantly polar uncharged asparagine  or negatively charged aspartic  or glutamic  acids. in contrast, the paralogs expressed in the cytosol exhibited at this position a serine  or a threonine , two amino acids with polar uncharged side chains. at position a <dig> the ancestral sequence and the plastidic paralogs contained diverse residues with a predominance of proline  while only glutamic acid  was found in cytosolic paralogs. residue s <dig>  was a serine in all paralogs encoded by distinct codons, tcn for ancestral and plastidic sequences but agy for cytosolic paralogs. finally at r <dig>  arginine  was the only residue found in the ancestral sequence and plastid-expressed paralogs, an amino acid with positively charged side chain, while the cytosolic paralogs carried two types of amino acids with hydrophobic side chains: valine  or isoleucine .

paralogs with functional specialization
in order to test if gene duplications in the evolutionary histories of the starch synthase, branching and debranching enzymes were accompanied by functional specialization following gene duplications, we tested for variation of evolutionary rates in branches emerging from these duplications.

starch synthase enzymes
the phylogeny of the starch synthase family  revealed three duplication events that occurred prior to the angiosperm radiation leading to the specialization in distinct functions. duplications d <dig> and d <dig> led to three paralogous clades encoding gbss, ssi, and ssii enzymes, and duplication d <dig> led to clades ssiii, and ssiv&ssv. each clade specialized in a distinct function in the emerging green lineage. additional duplications  were observed subsequent to the angiosperm radiation. we tested whether an acceleration in evolution rate had occurred along branches emerging from duplications d <dig> to d <dig> 

positive selection was observed along all branches following duplications d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  prior to angiosperm radiation . approximately 20% and 35% of sites evolved under positive selection in branches d1a and d1b, respectively, while the beb method did not allow us to pinpoint any particular residue. in branches d2a and d2b, respectively, about 9% and 20% sites were detected under positive selection with ω estimated as  <dig>  in branch d2a. using the beb method, we were able to detect  <dig> and  <dig> sites under positive selection in d2a and d2b, respectively . about 16% and 11% sites evolved under positive selection in branches d5a and d5b respectively, and the beb statistic allowed us to detect only one site as evolving under positive selection in branch d5b .

for more recent duplications, posterior to angiosperm radiation, positive selection was detected only in branch d4b, with about 10% sites under positive selection and  <dig> sites detected using the beb method . note that the clade model revealed a higher ω value  in the clade emerging from the branch exhibiting accelerated evolution  than in the clade emerging from d4a .

branching enzymes
the branching enzyme  gene phylogeny presented three clades of paralogs, be <dig>  be <dig> and be <dig> . while the origin of the be <dig> clade remains unclear , be <dig> and be <dig> arose selectively in the chloroplastida as they diverged from the other archaeplastida and the pathway was redirected to the plastids . two additional duplications, one specific to the poaceae  and one specific to the arabidopsis genus, arose within be <dig> . positive selection or relaxation of constraint were detected in both branches d1a and d1b, with about 9% and 13% sites having evolved under positive selection, respectively . using the beb method we were able to highlight  <dig> and  <dig> sites in branches d1a and d1b, respectively . the structure of the branching enzyme family and the presence of five catalytic sites included in conserved domains has been well described in pisum sativum <cit> , solanum tuberosum <cit> , oryza sativa <cit>  and sorghum bicolor <cit> . however, none of the sites that we detected under selection matched to these catalytic domains.

debranching enzymes
the debranching enzyme  gene phylogeny was composed of three clades of isoamylase genes  that arose from two duplication events  prior to the angiosperm radiation. the evolutionary history of debranching enzyme genes is complex and has been very recently reviewed  <cit> . the duplications depicted here occurred as the pathway of the emerging green lineage was progressively reconstructed in plastids.

acceleration in evolution rate was detected on the d1b branch, with about 9% sites under positive selection  and  <dig> sites were significant using the beb method . consistently with patterns observed for gbss, the clade emerging from the branch displaying evidence of accelerated evolution also exhibited the greatest ω value . about 9% and 23% of sites were detected under positive selection in branches d2a and d2b, respectively , and  <dig> and  <dig> sites detected with the beb method .

the poaceae albumen-specific adp-glucose transporter
genes coding for the adp-glucose transporter  are strictly restricted to poaceae. we retrieved the sequences from related transporters in plants  and built a phylogeny. the agt sequences form a monophyletic clade arising from pant <dig> through a duplication event  prior to the poaceae radiation. agt transports adp–glucose through the plastid membrane, while pant proteins are known or assumed to be plastidial adenine nucleotide transporters  <cit> , suggesting that the ancestral agt gene underwent neo-functionalization  <cit> . we thus tested for accelerated evolution in branch d1a that leads to the agt clade, but found no significant results . given the history of the transporter, this result is surprising and may result from reduced power, first because of the limited number of  <dig> aligned sequences. second, the different transporters shared only 50% homology, thus the alignment was based only on the most conserved residues.

discussion
upon gene duplication, loss is the expected fate of the majority of paralogs  <cit> . evidence comes from the study of mutational effects of individual proteins  <cit> . for instance, jacquier et al. <cit>  have shown that close to 50% of independent amino acid substitutions in a collection of  <dig> escherichia coli mutants of the beta-lactamase tem- <dig> exhibit deleterious effects as measured by a significant reduction of enzyme activity.

in this context, the starch biosynthetic pathway stands as an interesting example for studying the alternative fate, duplicated gene retention. reconstruction of the sbp in the ancestor of archaeplastida suggests that polysaccharide synthesis was ancestrally cytosolic, and then redirected to plastid at the origin of the chloroplastida <cit> . this change in protein addressing was clearly accompanied by numerous gene duplications leading to  <dig> and  <dig> genes involved in starch synthesis in maize and rice  <cit> . interestingly, along the evolution of the chloroplastida, complexification of the sbp was accompanied by an increase rate of paralog retention with fewer genes in chlorophyta and bryophyta  as compared to angiosperms . this diversification is particularly prominent at the end of the synthesis pathway , where functions are fulfilled by a myriad of paralogs. the maintenance of so many paralogs has been possible because of the concomitant enzyme specialization and suggests that duplications were followed by sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization. in the present paper, we explore the evolutionary fate of genes from  <dig> families encoding sbp enzymes and revealed patterns of selection that have accompanied major gene duplication events and paralog preservation in the starch biosynthetic pathway.

cytosolic/plastidic specialization
in the ancestor of archaeplastida, as well as in extant glaucophytes and rhodophytes, the nucleotide-sugar substrates were used for chain elongation exclusively in the cytosol  <cit> . multiple rounds of duplications for both pgm and pho genes have subsequently occurred during the green line radiation  <cit> , one of which has given rise to a cytosolic/plastidic specialization . it is currently unknown where the ancestral genes of pgm or pho were expressed in chlorophytes  <cit> . we detected positive selection accompanying compartmental specialization for these two enzymes, i.e. along the two branches emerging from each duplication event . this pattern is compatible with the eac sub-functionalization model that assumes that both paralogs evolve under positive selection thereby improving two distinct functions or sub-functions initially fulfilled by the ancestral gene.

we detected numerous sites under positive selection in both pgm and pho. two functional domains have been described in the pgm sequence: a catalytic domain and a metal ion binding domain  <cit> . the first site of the catalytic domain and the last site of the metal ion-binding domain differed between plastidic- and cytosolic-expressed paralog sequences but were not found to have evolved under positive selection . additionally, none of the pgm sites under positive selection occurred in these functional domains . however, the sites we detected may be good candidates for future functional studies and help to reveal still unknown domains. similarly, sites detected under positive selection in pho genes, for which no functional region is described, could help in the identification of crucial regions in this protein.

along the branch that gave rise to the pgm cytosolic paralogs , positive selection was detected at  <dig> sites and was accompanied by changes in amino acid residues . at position r <dig>  amino acid residues with hydrophobic side chains replaced amino acid residues with positively charged side chains. this has likely modified the tertiary structure of the protein and its function and/or allosteric regulation since proteins are usually more stable with hydrophobic residues in the internal part of proteins  while positively charged  amino acids are mostly found on the protein surface.

at position s <dig>  all paralogs shared the same amino acid encoded however by distinct codons, tcn for plastidic paralogs and ancestral sequence but agy for cytosolic paralogs. such a pattern of changes that involves multiple mutations could be explained by an initial deleterious mutation compensated by selection on subsequent mutations that restored the identity of the s residue.

functional specialization
phylogenies of starch synthesis enzymes  in the land plants reveal several duplications that occurred before angiosperm radiation  and led to a diverse panel of specialized enzymes that together insure the starch branching and debranching processes  <cit> . in the dbe family , positive selection was observed in branch d1b but not d1a, suggesting that neo-functionalization accompanied the isa <dig> gene divergence. this result is in agreement with the existence of a distinct ancestral function for this enzyme. indeed it is highly suspected that this enzyme emerged through duplication of a glgx type of glucan hydrolase of chlamydial origin. in bacteria this enzyme displays a restricted substrate specificity in line with its function in glycogen catabolism. isa <dig> has evolved both a novel substrate specificity allowing it to debranch longer chains and also most probably a novel quaternary organisation into either the isa <dig> dimer or the isa1/isa <dig> heteromultimer  <cit> . it is very likely that the ancestor of isa <dig> and isa <dig> genes maintained a glgx-like function. upon duplication isa <dig> acquired a function as a scaffolding subunit of the complex heteromultimeric isa1/isa <dig> enzyme. it lost its catalytic function in this process, which correlates with longer branches in maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees. isa <dig> on the other hand maintained some of glgx restrictions with respect to substrate outer chain lengths but acquired the ability to accommodate debranching of a wider variety of branched oligosaccharides. thus, the change in evolutionary rate we detected in both branches that gave rise to isa <dig> and isa <dig>  strongly suggest that positive selection rather constraint relaxation drove their divergence toward distinct specialized functions  <cit> .

multiple isoforms of starch synthase have been described in plants: the soluble forms ssi, ssii, ssiii, ssiv&ssv and the insoluble form gbss. several authors studied the ss functional domains  <cit> , and revealed a major catalytic domain of about  <dig> amino acids common to all starch synthases. this domain was aligned and used to build the phylogeny of starch synthases . the ssi enzyme is involved in the synthesis of small chains of amylopectin. the ssii and ssiii play a major role in the synthesis of amylopectin, while the ssiv&ssv have a specific function in regulating the number of starch granules  <cit> . the ancestral function confined to amylose synthesis in the green lineage is still fulfilled by gbss. duplications d <dig>  d <dig> and d <dig>  occurred during divergence of the chloroplastida from the two other archaeplastida . we detected positive selection in branch d1a  in accordance with the new functions fulfilled by ssi and ssii when they diverged from gbss. detection of positive selection in branch d1b is more difficult to interpret. following the gbss specific duplication d <dig>  positive selection was detected in branch d4b but not d4a , suggesting a pattern of neo-functionalization in the ancestral paralog of monocots. in this case neo-functionalization could very well comply with the iad model. indeed gbssi in green algae was proven to exhibit two different modes of action for starch synthesis  <cit> . when the carbon flux to starch is low gbssi is chiefly concerned with the extension of amylopectin chains and the products of elongation remain embedded in the amylopectin structure. this situation is seen in green algae in mineral and nutrient supplied cultures where carbon is mostly directed to the cytosol to prepare for cell division  <cit> . the same situation is encountered in plant source tissues such as in leaves. when the flux to starch is very high as is the case in nutrient starved chlamydomonas reinhardtii, gbssi synthesizes longer glucans which can be found free from the amylopectin chains  <cit> . this fraction is generally and classically defined as amylose  <cit> . it is possible that a duplication of the gbssi structural gene facilitated the selection of a gbssi more specialized in the high carbon flux mode, a function that pre-existed in all dicot and green algal gbssi enzymes. gbssi is highly expressed in endosperm of members of poaceae and banana fruit pulp –high carbon flux organs – where it plays a critical role in starch accumulation  <cit> .

the branching enzymes be <dig> and be <dig> play different roles in the structure of amylopectin in storage organs  <cit> . the be <dig> knockout mutants observed display no particular phenotype, except in maize  <cit>  where be <dig> appears to be required for starch mobilization during seed germination, and in chlamydomonas where be <dig> mutants are defective for starch catabolism  <cit> . additionally, the be <dig> paralog is absent from the a. thaliana genome  <cit> , suggesting that it is not required for starch synthesis or mobilisation. in contrast, the be <dig> paralog has been more largely maintained, and plays a key role in starch synthesis  <cit> . unexpectedly, we found evidence of positive selection in the branches giving rise to both be <dig> and be <dig> , suggesting that the be <dig> paralog ancestor has initially evolved toward a specialized function that has secondarily been maintained in some taxa and lost in others. it is tempting to correlate this specialization to specific aspects of starch degradation during seed  or zygote  germination.

former results suggest that be <dig> is not directly issued from gene duplication but rather from an ancestral gene that could have pre-existed in the cytosolic glycogen metabolism network of the common ancestor of archaeplastida before plastid endosymbiosis and which was lost from many archaeplastida <cit> . this may explain why the grouping of be <dig> with be <dig> and be <dig> is not well supported in our phylogeny , making the study of selective pressures on the be <dig> ancestor irrelevant.

CONCLUSIONS
we detected several instances of positive selection accompanying compartmentalization or functional specializations along the two branches emerging from duplication events at various steps during the evolution of the starch biosynthesis pathway. several processes may generate these patterns including a combination of the above-cited models. for instance, sub-functionalization may be followed by independent improvements of functions but appeared as evidence for eac. we are also limited by the power of our analysis. hence, positive selection may not be detected in a branch if the improvement of a pre-existing  function has been fulfilled by a single or very few mutations. despite all these caveats, our study highlights a number of cases sustained by biological interpretations in favour of the eac sub-functionalization model. our results thereby support its prominence along the evolutionary history of starch biosynthesis pathway.

in all multigene families studied here, none of the sites detected under positive selection matched with known functional domains of the proteins. at the angiosperm level, enzymes encoded by a given multigene family share the same basic function. for example, in the starch synthase enzyme family, all enzymes catalyse the same reaction that binds two glucoses in α- <dig>   <cit> . differences between those enzymes are therefore subtle and have to do with the affinity for/production of amylopectin chains with distinct length and solubility. in the sbp, important interactions between enzymes exist. for example, tetlow and collaborators  <cit>  showed that in wheat, complex structures were formed through the association of be <dig>  be2a and pho. hence, complex formation and phosphorylation are required to activate be2a. therefore, while the basic function  of every enzyme in a multigene family is constrained, function of the enzyme complex  may evolve after a duplication event. our results suggest that new functions are generally acquired by mutations outside the highly conserved catalytic domains, most likely in regulatory domains and/or residues involved in changes in enzyme conformation/activity.
