BACKGROUND
dab <dig> was first identified as doc- <dig> which is differentially expressed in ovarian carcinoma and cell lines  <cit> . it was later characterized as a tumor suppressor in various types of tumors  <cit> . subsequent studies indicated dab <dig> as one of two mammalian orthologs of the drosophila disabled   <cit> , a family member of the disabled proteins involved in neurogenesis, oncogenesis, cellular signaling and embryonic development. three different spliced forms of dab <dig> cdnas encoding variants p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> were previously identified from a mouse macrophage library  <cit> . of these, p <dig> was isolated as a mitogenic responsive phosphoprotein with possible function in the macrophage csf- <dig> signal transduction pathway  <cit> . the complete genomic dna sequence of the mouse dab <dig> gene and its chromosomal localization at 15a <dig> were reported  <cit> .

sequence analyses  <cit>  indicated dab <dig> as an adaptor protein involved in signal transduction. the n-terminus of the protein contains a highly conserved phosphotyrosine interacting domain  which interacts with proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine residue. within its c-terminus, the proline-rich domain exhibits multiple sh <dig> binding motifs capable of interacting with sh3-containing signaling molecules such as grb <dig>  signaling pathways involving dab <dig> have not been fully characterized. however, there is evidence to suggest that dab <dig> is an essential component of the transforming growth factor β  signaling pathway   <cit> . dab <dig> has also been shown to act as a regulator of the ras/mitogen-activated protein kinases  pathway  <cit> , src activity  <cit>  and canonical wnt/β-catenin-induced signaling  <cit> .

considering that molecular interactions through such signaling pathways are important for normal growth and differentiation of embryonic structures, it has been proposed that dab <dig> may also be involved in a number of different developmental processes  <cit> . for example, expression of dab <dig> is upregulated upon retinoic acid treatment  <cit>  or during the normal differentiation of f <dig> cells, a multipotent embryonic carcinoma cell line  <cit> , into primitive endoderm-like cells  <cit> . cho et al. also showed that the temporal expression pattern of the murine dab <dig> gene coincided with the initiation pattern of retinoic acid synthesis in embryonic mice  <cit> . furthermore, gene targeting studies have demonstrated that dab <dig> is a direct and specific downstream target of the zinc finger transcription factor gata- <dig> in the visceral endoderm  <cit> . in the absence of dab <dig>  the visceral endoderm becomes disorganized, resulting in growth failure of the inner cell mass. the dab2-deficient embryo then fails to gastrulate and ceases development at around embryonic day  <dig>  to  <dig>   <cit> . in addition to the visceral endoderm, dab <dig> mrna is also expressed in the branchial arch mesenchyme and septum transversum during development  <cit> . a recent study showed that dab <dig> is required for tgfβ-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition  <cit> , which is an important multi-step process necessary for the proper development of many early embryonic structures including the neural crest, the primitive streak and somites  <cit> .

another mammalian ortholog of the drosophila disabled is dab <dig>  a related gene which also contains pid in its n-terminus. it has already been demonstrated that the dab <dig> protein is important in regulating the positioning of migrating neurons during mammalian neurogenesis  <cit> . mouse dab <dig> is expressed in cortical neurons, and targeted disruption of dab <dig> resulted in abnormal neuronal layering in the developing cerebral cortex and cerebellum, together with an indistinct dentate gyrus and ca <dig> and ca <dig> regions of the hippocampus  <cit> . such defects partly resulted from a failure of dab1-/- neurons to detach from radial glia during the late stage of neuronal migration  <cit> . despite the functional similarity of dab <dig> and dab <dig> proteins in cell positioning during development, it is not known whether dab <dig> also play key roles during the development of the embryonic central nervous system , although it has recently been shown that dab <dig> inhibits ngf-mediated neurite outgrowth in vitro  <cit> . whether the expression of dab <dig> is regulated in a developmental fashion has not been determined previously. therefore in this investigation our primary aim was to characterize the spatiotemporal patterns of expression and the cellular localization of dab <dig> protein within the embryonic murine cns as an initial step towards further understanding the developmental roles of dab <dig> 

RESULTS
dab <dig> immunoreactivity in the floor plate and rhombomeres
dab <dig> immunoreactivity was first observed in the neuroepithelium of the prospective hindbrain region at e <dig>   . the expression was observed as a small positive band near the caudal margin of the closing anterior neuropore, corresponding to the position of rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> . this was regionally restricted, as other regions of the neuroepithelium lacked dab <dig> expression. at e <dig>  and e <dig> , the neuroepithelium of rhombomere  <dig> was strongly dab <dig> positive in its entire extent , whereas only the ventral part of rhombomere  <dig> showed immunoreactivity . in addition to rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig>  dab <dig> was also expressed in a narrow strip of the ventral neural tube extending from the mesencephalic flexure down to the spinal neural tube . sections through the spinal neural tube revealed dab <dig> expression restricted to the floor plate . dab <dig> expression in the floor plate was initially detected in the rostral part of the spinal cord and gradually shifted in a rostral-to-caudal manner to the caudal spinal cord . weak dab <dig> immunoreactivity was also detected in the caudal part of the notochord . by e <dig> , the dab <dig> protein expression was significantly down-regulated in these rhombomeres  and became undetectable by e <dig> . likewise, dab <dig> expression was progressively down-regulated in the floor plate of the neural tube from e <dig>  onwards. down-regulated expression of dab <dig> in the floor plate, also occurred in a rostral-to-caudal direction along the spinal cord . dab <dig> immunoreactivity in the floor plate became undetectable by e <dig>  . negative controls did not show any immunoreactive signals .

dab <dig> immunoreactivity in the developing choroid plexus
dab <dig> protein was detected in the roof plate of the hindbrain between e <dig>  and e <dig>  . at e <dig> , the developing choroid plexus of the lateral ventricles and the fourth ventricle  were dab <dig> immunoreactive. the choroid plexus of the third ventricle, which developed slightly later, was also positive for dab <dig> . however, the neuroepithelium adjacent to the choroid plexus was clearly negative and a distinct boundary between the immunoreactive choroid plexus and the adjacent neuroepithelium which lacked staining, was easily discernible . the entire choroid plexus, including most of the epithelial cells that lined the ventricles and their underlying mesenchyme, was dab <dig> positive . more intense expression was associated with the apical aspect  as compared to the basal aspect of epithelial cells . the choroid plexus continued to express the dab <dig> protein in adulthood, and consequently, became the most prominent dab <dig> positive structure in the adult cns , with the exception that the intensity and localization of dab <dig> expression was reversed: in contrast to the embryonic choroid plexus, which showed strong dab <dig> immunoreactivity on the luminal  side of the epithelium , the luminal surface of the epithelial cells in the adult choroid plexus showed weaker immunoreactivity compared to the basal surface .

dab <dig> immunoreactivity within the developing subcommissural organ and pineal gland
the presumptive subcommissural organ  develops from the region of the roof plate of the diencephalon just anterior to the mesencephalon . as development progresses, the sco neuroepithelium, which lies underneath  the posterior commissure, became morphologically more distinct from the adjacent neuroepithelium . dab <dig> immunoreactive cells were detected in the developing sco at e <dig>  and the expression became progressively more prominent , particularly in the cell layers immediately below the posterior commissure and also in the thin processes extending from the sco to the posterior commissure . the ventricular aspect of the sco however showed only weak dab <dig> immunoreactivity . double immunofluorescent labeling of dab <dig> and pgp <dig> , a pan-neuronal marker, was performed in order to determine whether dab <dig> was expressed in neurons or nerve fibers that were closely associated with the sco. in embryos at late stages  the sco neuroepithelium was dab <dig> positive but negative for pgp <dig> , whereas the posterior commissure above the sco was pgp <dig>  positive but negative for dab <dig> , indicating that dab2-immunoreactive cells were unlikely to represent differentiating neurons. dab <dig> expression was persistently detected in the sco during prenatal development but was not found in the adult . the pineal gland additionally showed dab <dig> immunoreactivity at e <dig>   but dab <dig> was not detectable in the adult pineal gland .

dab <dig> immunoreactivity in developing mononuclear phagocytes 
within the developing neural tube
scattered but strongly dab2-immunoreactive cells were detected within the neuroepithelium at e <dig>  – e <dig>  . double labeling with the iba <dig> antibody , a mononuclear phagocyte marker expressed on cells of the macrophage and microglial cell lineages  <cit> , showed that the dab <dig> protein was co-expressed with iba <dig> protein . dab <dig> immunoreactive cells did not express pgp <dig> , indicating that they were not early differentiating neurons . although all dab2-positive cells showed iba <dig> immunoreactivity, cells that were iba <dig> positive but dab <dig> negative  were also observed . iba1+/dab2+ cells resembled the early fetal macrophages previously reported in the developing cns  <cit> , several of which were found in the proximity of blood vessels at e <dig>   and e <dig>  . however, their close relationship with blood vessels was lost at e <dig> , at which time iba1+/dab2+ cells were found dispersed throughout the neural tube . iba1+/dab2+ fetal macrophages were also frequently detected inside the ventricles, in regions close to the ventricular wall . from e <dig>  onwards, however, scattered iba1+/dab2+ cells were no longer detected within the neural tube, leaving only iba1+/dab2- cells  within the neural tube . the endothelial lining of the brain microvasculature also expressed dab <dig> from e <dig>  onwards . in the adult, however, dab <dig> immunoreactivity persisted only in perivascular macrophages  associated with cerebral blood vessels, but was absent from the endothelial lining of these vessels . perivascular cell expression of dab <dig> was prominent throughout the entire adult cns. these cells were not uniform in shape but were either oval with small processes, or flat and elongated in shape , as has been previously described  <cit> . unlike embryonic cns, where cells closely apposed to the microvasculature expressed both iba <dig> and dab <dig> protein, dab <dig> positive perivascular cells in the adult brain did not appear to co-express iba <dig> protein . instead, double immunofluorescent labeling revealed that some, but not all, of these dab <dig> immunopositive perivascular cells co-expressed f4/ <dig> antigen, indicating that they were of the macrophage lineage  .

outside the developing neural tube
scattered cells strongly positive for dab <dig> were also detected within mesenchymal tissues outside the neural tube from e <dig>  , about half a day earlier than iba1+/dab2+ cells inside the neural tube. these dab <dig> positive cells were also iba <dig> positive . the macrophage differentiation marker, f4/ <dig> antigen, began to be expressed weakly in these fetal macrophages located outside the neural tube at e <dig>  and became prominent from e <dig>  onwards. double immunofluorescence staining for dab <dig> and f4/ <dig> showed that all dab <dig> positive cells were also f4/ <dig> immunoreactive from e <dig>  onwards . in contrast to the transient, developmentally-restricted expression of dab <dig> protein associated with mononuclear cells  located inside the neural tube, dab <dig> protein continued to be persistently expressed in macrophages throughout the body into adulthood .

discussion
we have characterized in detail the expression pattern for dab <dig> in the mouse embryonic central nervous system throughout development. dynamic expression of dab <dig> protein was detected in the neuroepithelium, blood vessels, circumventricular organs and mononuclear phagocytes , strongly suggesting that dab <dig> is an important molecule during mammalian cns and myeloid cell development. unlike dab <dig>  which is expressed in cortical neurons, dab <dig> expression is restricted to non-neuronal cells or immature neuroepithelial cells.

at e <dig> , while signaling genes such as hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig>  kr and krox <dig> are interacting to pattern the early hindbrain  <cit> , dab <dig> is expressed in presumptive rhombomeres  <dig> and  <dig> . there are  <dig> to  <dig> rhombomeres, morphologically repeated compartments, transiently segregated along the anteroposterior axis of the vertebrate embryonic hindbrain. these compartments play pivotal roles in the specification and segregation of neurons and neural crest cells along the anteroposterior axis of the hindbrain  <cit> . it is well-established that genes with rhombomere-restricted expression  function to establish the identities of compartments  <cit> . interestingly, it has been shown that dab <dig> expression is significantly up-regulated in hoxa <dig> knockout embryonic stem cells  <cit> . in the early hindbrain at e <dig>  hoxa <dig> is expressed in r4- <dig> and gradually restricted to r <dig> at e <dig>   <cit> . such down-regulation correlates spatiotemporally with the onset of dab <dig> expression within r5- <dig> at e <dig> . a further understanding of the interactions between dab <dig> and hoxa <dig> will greatly enhance our knowledge of signaling cascades associated with hindbrain specification.

during development, dorsoventral patterning along the neural tube is controlled by the expression of sonic hedgehog   <cit> . shh is expressed by cells along the ventral midline of the embryonic forebrain, in the floor plate and the notochord of the hindbrain and spinal cord  <cit> . since the encoded protein is in a secreted form, shh protein expression displays a more diffuse pattern  <cit> . dab <dig> protein expression appears to overlap with the region expressing shh mrna in the floor plate and notochord at e <dig>  but not the regions showing shh protein  <cit> . moreover, dab <dig> protein expression is turned off much earlier in the floor plate  than for shh in the ventral spinal cord at e <dig>   <cit> . the potential involvement of dab <dig> in anteroposterior and dorsoventral patterning requires further investigation.

dab <dig> protein was also detected within circumventricular organs including the choroid plexus, the subcommissural organ and the pineal gland. dab <dig> may represent one of the earliest markers for the choroid plexus primordium in the roof plate of the hindbrain. its persistent expression in the choroid plexus throughout life, however, indicates that dab <dig> may not only be involved in the early formation of the choroid plexus but may also have a role in the transport of macromolecules across the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus to the cerebral ventricles. evidence to support this hypothesis comes from studies on megalin, a well-known receptor for dab <dig>  <cit> . megalin mediates the transport of apolipoprotein j, alzheimer's amyloid-beta peptide, leptin, insulin-like growth factor-i, and also regulates macromolecule transport from the cerebral microvessels and choroid plexus to cerebral ventricles, thereby maintaining homeostasis in cerebrospinal fluid , as well as exerting neuroprotective action  <cit> . in the absence of dab <dig>  the protein levels of megalin are reduced and the subcellular localization of megalin is altered  <cit> . the choroid plexus starts to secrete csf very early during development  <cit> , correlating well with the early expression of dab <dig> protein. we found that dab <dig> is also prominently expressed in microvilli on the luminal surface of the embryonic choroid epithelium, consistent with a role associated with macromolecule transport and secretory functions. however, the change observed in asymmetric expression between the luminal and the basal surface from embryonic to adult states  remains unclear.

dab <dig> immunoreactivity was detected in another developing circumventricular organ, the subcommissural organ . the sco develops very early during embryogenesis, representing one of the first secretory brain structures to differentiate  <cit> . the very early ontogenetic differentiation of sco secretory cells is crucial for the smooth circulation of csf secreted from the choroid plexus during early development. the present study shows that dab <dig> is specifically expressed in the developing sco primordium at an early stage . both the choroid plexus and the sco are secretory organs that develop very early in embryos. however, unlike the early and persistent expression of dab <dig> in the choroid plexus, the dab <dig> protein appeared transiently in sco-secretory cells, a phenomenon that may possibly be related to the morphogenesis of sco. similar to the sco, the developing pineal gland also showed transient dab <dig> expression in the present study. dab <dig> expression in the developing pineal gland was not detected at or before e <dig>  but became distinct by e <dig> , the stage at which pinealocytes undergo rapid proliferation in rodents  <cit> . it is likely that dab <dig> is expressed in developing pinealocytes, although we cannot rule out the possibility that interstitial cells also express the dab <dig> protein. the functional significance of a transient expression of dab <dig> in the developing pineal gland remains to be investigated.

other than the expression in secretory epithelial cells, dab <dig> was also detected in cells of the myeloid lineage, specifically mononuclear phagocytes. we have clearly shown that dab <dig> is expressed at early developmental stages in mononuclear phagocytes  both outside the developing neural tube  and transiently within the neural tube . the expression of dab <dig>  in mature macrophages is perhaps not surprising given its initial characterization from a macrophage cell line  <cit> . however, the functional roles played by dab <dig> in lineage commitment and differentiation of myeloid-derived mononuclear phagocytes are only recently being investigated  <cit> , and have clear implications for determining the lineage and differentiation also of microglia. icsbp , and the ets transcription factor pu. <dig>  are haematopoietic-restricted transcription factors critical for the development of haematopoietic cells  <cit> . pu. <dig> is an essential factor required for myeloid cell differentiation  <cit> . both of these transcription factors bind to the dab <dig> promoter, but whereas icsbp represses dab <dig> promoter transactivation, pu. <dig> induces it  <cit> . significantly, icsbp represses the pu.1-induced transactivation, thereby suppressing dab <dig> expression. these data indicate that cross-talk between pu. <dig> and icsbp may be crucial in regulating genes related to myeloid cell differentiation and cell functions. taken together and in context with our current findings showing an increased and persistent expression of dab <dig> in developing and adult macrophages compared to the lack of dab <dig> in adult microglia, these results allude to differences in myeloid cell differentiation  between macrophages and microglial cells  <cit>  that need to be explored in greater depth.

transient expression of dab <dig> was detected in early iba-1+cells located within the neural tube, in cells closely apposed to blood vessels and to the ventricular walls. these observations may imply that at least a subpopulation of early microglia  are derived from myeloid progenitors migrating into neural tube via microvessels, rather than derived in situ  <cit> . downregulation, or indeed lack of dab <dig> expression in subsequently developing microglia may represent an important event during the differentiation and maturation of these cells.

dab <dig> acts as a signalling molecule in csf-1/mcsf  signal transduction  <cit> . microglia, unlike cells of the macrophage lineage, are not exclusively dependent on csf- <dig> for cell survival and differentiation  <cit> . the lack of dab <dig> protein expression in microglia  which persists throughout development , in adult cns microglia at rest , and even under traumatic injury  <cit> , may reflect this lack of dependency on csf-1/mcsf for differentiation and/or survival of these cells, which in turn points to differences in environmental trophic support for mononuclear phagocytes within the cns.

although dab <dig> was not expressed in adult microglia, it was expressed in another mononuclear phagocytic cell type in the cns, namely perivascular macrophages which co-expressed f4/ <dig> antigen. the differential expression of dab <dig> in mononuclear phagocytes  renders it a useful marker to further study the origin and responses of these cells.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first detailed report on the spatio-temporal expression of dab <dig> during cns development in mammals. unlike dab <dig>  which is expressed in developing neuronal cells, dab <dig> protein is dynamically expressed in various regions of the developing cns, primarily restricted to non-neuronal cells including within circumventricular organs, in secretory cells, immature neuroepithelial cells, endothelial cells and in populations of mononuclear phagocytes , but lacking in neurons, neuroglial cells and in mature microglia. these findings are consistent with its expression pattern observed in the adult nervous system , and in response to cns injury  <cit>  where dab <dig> expression is primarily located to macrophages accumulating at the site of injury, but absent from neurons, neuroglia and microglia. expression of dab <dig> in polarized epithelial cells in developing circumventricular organs may be consistent with the well-documented functions of dab <dig> in mediating endocytic trafficking of clathrin-coated vesicles  <cit> , and in directing cell surface positioning  <cit> . dab <dig> is further implicated in myeloid cell differentiation and macrophage development. our findings highlight the need for further investigations into the biological functions of dab <dig> in early cns and myeloid cell development.
