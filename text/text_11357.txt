BACKGROUND
it is estimated that  <dig>  million people worldwide are infected with shigella each year, resulting in ~ <dig>  million deaths  <cit> . shigella flexneri are gram-negative, facultative intracellular anaerobic pathogens that can cause full-blown infections from the ingestion of as few as  <dig> bacteria  <cit> . these infections trigger the disease shigellosis, characterized by severe inflammatory dysentery, accompanied by watery, bloody diarrhea  <cit> . upon ingestion, the bacteria travel throughout the intestinal tract to the colon, where they are phagocytosed by antigen sampling m-cells of the intestinal epithelium and then infect host macrophages and dendritic cells  <cit> . once within their hosts, they initiate host cell death and are released to the surrounding environment to invade the basolateral surface of intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . it is within the cytoplasm of these enterocytes that s. flexneri actively replicate and then disseminate to neighboring cells  <cit> .

s. flexneri invade enterocytes through bacterially-induced actin-based macropinocytosis; a process similar to salmonella typhimurium invasion, which is generally referred to as a "triggering" mechanism of bacterial entry  <cit> . this is in contrast to the mode of l. monocytogenes entry, which exploit clathrin-based "zippering" internalization mechanisms  <cit> . once internalized, s. flexneri quickly disrupts the vacuolar membrane breaking free into the host cell cytosol  <cit> , which is unlike s. typhimurium where upon entry they occupy a phagosome within the infected cells  <cit> . s. flexneri then express the icsa  protein that localizes to one pole of the bacterial outer membrane. icsa recruits the actin-associated protein n-wasp, initiating actin polymerization at the bacterial membrane  <cit> . in a similar manner as during l. monocytogenes infections, actin recruitment at one pole of s. flexneri creates a "comet tail" that propels the bacterium throughout the host cell and into neighboring cells  <cit> . although those comet tail strategies are similar, l. monocytogenes utilize the bacterial factor acta to mimic n-wasp and thus directly recruit the arp2/ <dig> complex to the bacteria without the need of n-wasp itself  <cit> . thus, although s. flexneri adopt similar pathogenic strategies as other enteric bacterial pathogens, there are distinct differences that occur during s. flexneri infections, requiring researchers to investigate these pathogens independently.

the spectrin cytoskeleton lies just beneath the plasma membrane of eukaryotic cells, providing structural support and protein-sorting capabilities to the membrane  <cit> . the spectrin sub-membranous scaffold is composed of spectrin heterotetramers, which are interlinked by short actin filaments of 14- <dig> monomers  <cit> . spectrin/actin interactions are facilitated by the spectrin-associated proteins adducin and protein  <dig>  , which encourage spectrin-actin binding and can simultaneously bind a number of membrane-associated proteins  <cit> . consequently, adducin and p <dig>  enable the proper anchoring and sorting of membrane associated proteins at the plasma membrane in conjunction with the spectrin scaffold  <cit> .

the spectrin cytoskeleton has recently been shown to be important for the pathogenesis of the invasive pathogens s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes  <cit> . spectrin, adducin and p <dig>  in conjunction with actin are recruited to sites of bacterial/host cell invasion as well as to structures generated at various stages of those intracellular infections. knockdown of spectrin cytoskeletal components demonstrated that they were necessary for both s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes pathogenesis  <cit> . based on these findings, we hypothesized that s. flexneri might also exploit spectrin cytoskeletal components during their infections of host cells. in this study we examined the involvement of the spectrin cytoskeleton during the invasion of s. flexneri into epithelial cells as well as at later time-points, during the formation of comet tails. we demonstrate striking differences in spectrin cytoskeletal involvement in s. flexneri pathogenesis as compared to s. typhimurium or l. monocytogenes. we show that p <dig> , but not spectrin or adducin, is acutely recruited to the ruffles generated during the initial invasion of s. flexneri into epithelial cells, despite all three proteins  being crucial for efficient invasion when examined using sirna-based knockdowns of spectrin components. further studies demonstrated the recruitment of spectrin, adducin and p <dig>  to intracellular bacteria, prior to comet tail formation. however, unlike at l. monocytogenes comet tails, we show that spectrin is recruited to s. flexneri comet tails. these studies demonstrate a novel cytoskeletal system crucial to s. flexneri pathogenesis, while also highlighting dramatic differences between the cytoskeletal hijacking strategies of s. flexneri, s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes.

RESULTS
spectrin cytoskeletal proteins are key components to s. flexneri invasion of epithelial cells
to examine the role of spectrin cytoskeletal proteins during s. flexneri invasion, we infected hela cells with s. flexneri for  <dig> minutes and immunolocalized spectrin, adducin and p <dig> . to identify bacterial sites of invasion, indicated by actin-rich membrane ruffles, we probed the cells with alexa fluor conjugated phalloidin  as well as dapi . we found that p <dig>  was recruited to 94% of s. flexneri invasion sites . however, spectrin and adducin were largely absent from sites of s. flexneri invasion, showing recruitment to only 3% and15% of invasion sites respectively .

we then sought to identify if any of the spectrin cytoskeletal proteins influenced s. flexneri invasion. to accomplish this, we utilized pools of  <dig> sirna's targeted against spectrin, adducin and p <dig>  to knockdown those proteins in cells prior to infection with s. flexneri. to control for non-specific/off target effects of the sirna treatments, we transfected cells with a control pool of  <dig> non-targeting sirnas  <cit> . successful knockdowns were confirmed using western blots . actin filaments remain unaltered during spectrin cytoskeletal knockdowns  <cit> . sirna pre-treated cells were infected with s. flexneri for 30-minutes, followed by 1-hour gentamycin treatment to kill external bacteria, prior to fixation and subsequent immunolocalization. we then enumerated the total number of cells infected, counting each cell with  <dig> or more bacterium inside as  <dig> infection event. we observed a significant reduction in s. flexneri's ability to invade cells in the absence of each spectrin cytoskeletal protein. in cells with undetectable levels of spectrin, adducin, or p <dig> , we observed 38%/22%/16% invasion  as compared to s. flexneri infections of the control pool  treated cells . the important role for spectrin cytoskeletal components during invasion was confirmed using a classical invasion assay, with gentamycin treatment, showing significant decreases in invasion when any of the spectrin cytoskeletal components were knocked down . because sirna mediated knockdown is not 100% efficient, the classical invasion assay results include cells with incomplete knockdowns, hence the reduction in total invasion is not as dramatic as in figure 1e compared to  <dig> d. microscopic analysis revealed cells with unsuccessful knockdown beside cells with near complete knockdown in the same field of view. this analysis demonstrated bacterial invasion of cells with unsuccessful knockdown and lack of bacteria within the successfully knocked-down cells .

intracellular s. flexneri recruits spectrin cytoskeletal proteins at key stages of the infections
to examine the intracellular life of s. flexneri, we began by observing internalized bacteria  <dig>  hours after the initial infections. at this stage of the infections, the bacteria can replicate within the host cell cytoplasm and some are at the initial phases of recruiting actin to produce the characteristic comet tails. when we examined spectrin, adducin and p <dig> , we noticed recruitment of these proteins localized to the area of internalized bacteria . f-actin only partially co-localized with some of the areas of spectrin cytoskeletal protein recruitment, with many bacteria having only recruited the spectrin cytoskeletal proteins at this stage of the infections . we examined the proportion of the bacteria that associated with spectrin cytoskeletal proteins, irrespective of actin recruitment, and found that 95%, 72%, and 73% of internalized bacteria were associated with spectrin, p <dig>  and adducin at  <dig>  hours post infection .

we then investigated s. flexneri during the intracellular motile stage, when the bacteria utilize actin-rich comet tails to propel throughout the host cytoplasm. after  <dig>  hours of infection, many of the bacteria have produced the tail structures. we infected cells for  <dig>  hours and then visualized the spectrin cytoskeletal proteins in conjunction with f-actin. spectrin was recruited, albeit not as intensely as actin, to 61% of s. flexneri comet tails, colocalizing with actin . specifically, spectrin localization within the comet tail was strongest at regions where f-actin was less abundant, being most intensely found ~2- <dig> Î¼m distal to the interface between the actin-tail and bacterium . adducin and p <dig>  were not recruited to the comet tail .

discussion
previous studies have shown that the membranous ruffles triggered by s. typhimurium and the actin-rich comet tails generated during l. monocytogenes infections share some morphological and structural characteristics with s. flexneri during their infectious process  <cit> . s. typhimurium and l. monocytogenes recruit and require spectrin cytoskeletal proteins for their efficient invasion as well as for subsequent infectious stages within their host cells  <cit> . based on these similarities, we hypothesized that s. flexneri may also exploit spectrin cytoskeletal proteins during their infections. here we have identified important roles for the spectrin cytoskeleton during s. flexneri initiated macropinocytic invasion of host cells and their presence at comet tails.

during s. flexneri invasion, a multitude of actin cytoskeletal-associated proteins are recruited to membrane ruffles triggered by t3ss translocated bacterial effectors  <cit> . we found that during s. flexneri infections, p <dig>  but not spectrin or adducin, localized to 94% of invasion events. despite the near complete absence of spectrin or adducin recruitment, when any of the three proteins were disrupted through sirna treatments, invasion of s. flexneri was severely decreased. how can the decreased expression of spectrin cytoskeletal proteins that are not markedly recruited to invasion sites have such a dramatic impact on s. flexneri invasion? clues to understanding this can be derived from previous research investigating spectrin cytoskeletal involvement during cell migration. there are many shared protein components and structural similarities between s. flexneri membrane invasion ruffles and membrane protrusions generated during cell migration events. during cell migration, spectrin, adducin and p <dig>  often co-localize with, and are necessary for, the recruitment and correct localization of actin-associated machineries to the sub-membranous region of the plasma membrane  <cit> . knockdown of p <dig> , or functional perturbation of adducin, both result in an inhibition of membrane protrusions and lack of cell motility  <cit> . thus, it is plausible that proteins involved in actin dynamics leading to the formation of s. flexneri membrane ruffles and their subsequent invasion are mis-localized when spectrin, adducin, or p <dig>  is knocked down. this could explain the observed decrease in bacterial invasion in their absence. despite not being intensely localized at sites of invasion, we did observe faint recruitment of spectrin and adducin at these invasion sites.

the lack of robust spectrin and adducin recruitment to s. flexneri invasion sites did not parallel what was found once the bacteria had invaded the host cells, as all three spectrin cytoskeletal components were found surrounding internalized bacteria. we observed their recruitment to invaded bacteria, in the absence of actin, suggesting that those proteins likely arrived at the bacterial interface prior to the recruitment of actin and subsequent comet tail formation. it is possible that spectrin and associated proteins may help recruit the actin machinery to the bacteria, similarly to how they function within lamellipodia  <cit> , to produce the comet tails enabling intracellular motility. unfortunately, due to the low abundance of bacteria internalized during spectrin cytoskeletal knockdowns, we were unable to investigate the impact of spectrin cytoskeletal protein involvement in actin recruitment to internalized bacteria.

upon s. flexneri generation of full-length actin-rich comet tails, spectrin was found at the comet tails, while p <dig>  and adducin were not. previous work that decorated filamentous actin with the s <dig> subfragment of myosin identified s. flexneri comet tails to be dense networks of branched and cross-linked actin filaments  <cit> . cross-linking proteins, such as Î±-actinin, are recruited to s. flexneri comet tails and are thought to provide the bacteria with a rigid platform off of which they propel  <cit> . spectrin is an established actin cross-linking protein, increasing the viscosity of actin filaments in vitro  <cit> . this cross-linking characteristic may be at work within s. flexneri comet tails, however this requires further scrutiny.

as the actin dynamics at the leading edge of motile cells are similar to those occurring during pathogen induced macropinocytotic membrane ruffling and comet tail motility, one would predict that similar components would be present at these sites. l. monocytogenes and s. flexneri have been used as model systems to study pseudopodial protrusions for years  <cit> . however, the identification of only spectrin and not adducin or p <dig>  at fully formed s. flexneri comet tails, together with the absence of all spectrin cytoskeletal components at l. monocytogenes comet tails  <cit> , highlight differences between membrane protrusion events during whole cell motility and those generated by bacterial pathogens. these findings demonstrate the diverse tactics used by microbes to regulate host components and further show that pathogens exploit varying factors during their infectious processes.

our findings, and findings from other papers  demonstrate that not all components of the spectrin cytoskeleton always act in concert. rather, we have observed that spectrin, adducin, and p <dig>  can act in the absence of each other during the pathogenic processes of s. flexneri, l. monocytogenes, s. typhimurium and enteropathogenic e. coli  pathogenesis. previous studies have highlighted roles for spectrin, adducin and p <dig> , irrespective of the influence of one another. adducin is capable of binding, cross-linking and bundling f-actin, in the absence of spectrin and p <dig>   <cit> . similarily, spectrin is capable of binding actin in the absence of adducin or p <dig>   <cit> . furthermore, purified spectrin and p <dig>  can cross-link actin filaments in vitro, in the absence of adducin  <cit> . adducin is also capable of binding a number of plasma membrane proteins, in the absence of spectrin  <cit> . thus, precedents from other systems support our findings that spectrin, adducin, and p <dig>  can act independently during bacterial pathogenesis.

CONCLUSIONS
invasion of intestinal epithelial cells and comet tail-based motility in host cells are key for s. flexneri to access replicative niches and disseminate throughout host tissues  <cit> . here we have demonstrated that the actin-rich structures generated by these microbes also employ another cytoskeletal system, the spectrin cytoskeleton. our identification of this structural network at these sites further highlights the importance of this system in bacterial pathogenesis and indicates that these crucial segments in the pathogenesis of s. flexneri require a hybrid cytoskeletal meshwork, previously thought to be exclusive to actin.
