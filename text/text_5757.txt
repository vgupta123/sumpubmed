BACKGROUND
conjugated linoleic acid  belongs to the family of  <dig> carbon fatty acids containing conjugated double bonds. it is found in dairy products and ruminant meats as a mixture of positional and geometric  isomers of linoleic acid . there is increasing evidence that cla has powerful anti-adiposity functions in both humans and animals  <cit> . cla treatment notably decreases body fat deposition and changes the route of fat metabolism, effects that have been observed in several different studies  <cit> . although the precise mechanism is still unclear, results of these studies demonstrate that cla may inhibit the proliferation and/or differentiation of adipose cells, and the synthesis and accumulation of triglycerides in adipocytes.

recently, some research groups have shown that cla can induce apoptosis of fat cells in mice and in 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes. in  <dig>  tsuboyama-kasaoka et al. first reported that supplying feed supplemented with 1% cla to c57bl/6 j mice for 5 months resulted in a clear decrease in the abdominal fat pad of the mice, with the adipocytes exhibiting typical apoptotic characteristics, such as dna fragmentation  <cit> . subsequent studies showed that cla also induced adipose cell apoptosis either in vitro or in vivo <cit> . it has long been known that cla has anti-cancer effects and can directly induce apoptosis of a number of different tumor cell types  <cit> . however, the effects of cla on apoptosis in adipose cells have not been widely reported, and the molecular mechanisms by which these effects occur are still unclear.

the aim of the current study was to clarify the role of cla in adipocyte apoptosis in pigs, whose physiological characteristics are similar to humans, thus making them a highly relevant model for obesity research. additionally, the molecules that regulate apoptosis in adipocytes were investigated.

RESULTS
cla supplementation reduces back fat accumulation in pigs
in our experiment, piglets were fed with  <dig>  1%, or 2% cla for 30 days. both the 1% and 2% cla-fed pigs demonstrated a loss of body weight compared with the control pigs by the end of the experiment. back fat tissue and abdominal fat pads of the piglets were collected, weighed, and analyzed. the results showed that cla-fed pigs had less body fat deposition, particularly of back fat . additionally, cla-fed pigs demonstrated an increased accumulation of intramuscular fat, indicating that cla has tissue-based differential effects on fat metabolism.

cla supplementation induces apoptosis of adipose cells
in the present study, some typical apoptotic phenomena such as cell shrinkage, chromatin condensation, fluorescence enhancement, and degradation of dna in cellular chromatin were observed in the adipose cells of cla-fed pigs  using the tunel assay , hoechst  <dig> staining , and agarose gel electrophoresis of dna . these results indicate that cla supplementation induces and/or promotes apoptosis of pig adipocytes.

mitochondrial signaling pathway plays an important role in cla-induced apoptosis
a number of molecules and signal transduction pathways participate in the apoptotic process. back fat tissue of cla-fed pigs had lower expression of bcl- <dig>  a key inhibitor of cellular apoptosis, at both mrna  and protein  levels. furthermore, mrna and protein expression of the pro-apoptotic molecule bax were slightly increased in the back fat of cla-fed pigs . these two factors function in the early part of the mitochondrial signaling pathway, and changes in their expression initiate activation, and significantly increase the expression, of p <dig>  as well as the release of cytochrome c to the cytoplasm . activity of caspase- <dig> showed a corresponding increase to  <dig>  fold , and expression level and activity of caspase- <dig> , a key apoptotic protein, both increased significantly. these results suggest that the mitochondrial signaling pathway plays a key role in cla-induced apoptosis of pig adipocytes.

death receptor signaling pathway trigged by tumor necrosis factor -α also participates in cla-induced apoptosis
we also examined the mrna level and the circulating concentration of tnf-α, an inflammatory factor and apoptosis inducer secreted by adipocytes. a previous study reported that tnf-α could induce cellular apoptosis as a ligand that activates the death receptor signaling pathway  <cit> . compared with control pigs, 2% cla–fed pigs showed significantly increased tnf-α mrna expression  in their back fat tissue . however, the circulating concentration of tnf-α protein  was significantly decreased . therefore, we speculate that a high level of tnf-α in back fat might play a role in the induction of adipocyte apoptosis by cla. furthermore, higher expression levels of tnfr  and higher activity of caspase- <dig>  in the fat tissue of cla-fed pigs indirectly support this suggestion.

discussion
fat metabolism and its related syndromes have been a primary focus of scientific research for many years. an increasing number of agents have been discovered for treating obesity, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . in recent years, cla, because of its robust anti-obesity effects, has gained increasing attention in studies on fat metabolism. our results are in agreement with previous studies showing that young pigs administered cla-supplemented feeds have less body fat .

the apoptotic process is characterized by programmed cell death regulated by numerous genes  <cit> . owing to the characteristics of adipocytes , apoptosis research in adipocytes has been less than that in other cell types. however, some recent studies have led to the belief that there is no obvious difference between apoptosis in adipocytes and apoptosis in other cells  <cit> . cla has long been considered an effective anti-cancer drug because it can induce apoptosis in various tumor cells and/or enhance the cells’ susceptibility to apoptosis. very few papers have reported that cla can also induce adipocyte apoptosis in rodents, or in adipocyte cell lines  <cit> . to investigate whether cla also induces apoptosis in pig adipocytes, the key aim of the current study, we examined , as we had expected. we therefore have reason to believe that cla can exert its anti-obesity function, at least partly, via inducing apoptosis in adipose cells.

the mechanisms of apoptosis are highly complex and sophisticated, involving an energy-dependent cascade of molecular events  <cit> . to date, research indicates that there are two main apoptotic pathways, the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway  <cit> . the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways converge on the same execution pathway. this pathway is initiated by the cleavage of caspase- <dig> and results in dna fragmentation, degradation of cytoskeletal and nuclear proteins, cross-linking of proteins, formation of apoptotic bodies, and finally uptake by phagocytic cells  <cit> . changes in both expression and activity of key apoptosis factors in the current experiment suggest that both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways were activated in the fat tissue of cla-fed pigs . in fact, there is recent evidence showing that the two pathways are linked, and that molecules in one pathway can influence the other  <cit> .

in the intrinsic pathway, stimuli such as drugs, radiation, or hypoxia induce dna injury, change mitochondrial permeability, and then discharge more active apoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c, which then combine with apoptotic protease activating factor- <dig>  and procaspase- <dig> to form an apoptosome. in this complex, self-cleavage and activation of procaspase- <dig> generates caspase- <dig>  which in turn activates caspase- <dig> in the presence of atp. in this process, the bcl- <dig> protein family plays a critical role. the family includes many proteins that are categorized based on their function as either pro-apoptotic proteins  or anti-apoptotic proteins   <cit> . bcl- <dig> inhibits the release of cytochrome c and inhibits the function of activated caspases while bax has the opposite effect. p <dig> is a transcription factor that is often seen as an important pro-apoptotic factor because dna-injury-increased p <dig> induces the expression of bax and promotes the release of cytochrome c  <cit> . based on the changes in the expression and activity of bcl- <dig>  bax, cytochrome c, p <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  our results suggest that the intrinsic pathway plays an important role in the cla-induced apoptosis of adipocytes. similar studies have also shown the importance of the intrinsic pathway in this process.

in the extrinsic pathway, death factors  function as ligands that bind to their respective receptor proteins , which then induces fas-associated with death domain protein to combine with procaspase- <dig> to form a death-inducing signaling complex . self-cleavage and activation of procaspase- <dig> in the disc generates caspase- <dig> and subsequently activates caspase- <dig>  <cit> . tnf-α is a powerful pro-apoptotic factor secreted by fat in mammals  <cit> . tsuboyama-kasaoka et al. observed a six-fold increase of tnfa mrna level in 1% cla-fed mice, and suggested that the increase was related to adipocyte apoptosis and decreased fat deposition  <cit> . in our studies, the increased expression of tnf-α, tnfr and the increased activity of caspase- <dig> demonstrate that the extrinsic pathway also participates in adipocyte apoptosis induced by cla.

CONCLUSIONS
as a potent anti-obesity agent, cla has gained a lot of attention and its mechanism of action is gradually becoming clear. though some studies have demonstrated that the inhibition of differentiation of adipocytes is the main mechanism by which cla induces anti-obesity effects, we believe that cla decreases body fat deposition in pigs at least partly by inducing adipocyte apoptosis. furthermore, both the extrinsic pathway and the intrinsic pathway participate in this event.
