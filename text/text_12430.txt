BACKGROUND
current threats to coral reefs, such as elevated sea water temperatures, coral disease, pollution and destructive and unsustainable fishing methods, have depleted or degraded more than half of the world's coral reefs  <cit> . the poor condition of many of these reefs is attributable to the extreme el ninõ event in  <dig>  which functionally destroyed approximately 16% of the world's coral reefs through bleaching-induced mass mortality. in  <dig>  slightly more than 40% of the reefs affected by the el ninõ showed signs of recovery. most of these reefs were exposed to minimal anthropogenic influence either because they were situated within well-managed marine reserves or were geographically remote  <cit> . a prerequisite for such recovery however, is successful recruitment of new coral colonies from remnant source populations. a range of statistics that are based on individual genotypes rather than population level allele frequencies are now available  <cit> , which allow the assignment or exclusion of genotypes within sampled populations and hence provide a more ecologically relevant measure of connectivity  <cit> . hence the results from population genetic studies provides information that can be incorporated into marine protected areas management strategies  <cit> .

to date, the processes underlying the highly variable population genetic structures in corals remain poorly understood  <cit> . many studies have shown that life history characteristics such as reproductive mode and larval competency may serve as reliable predictors of dispersal patterns in marine invertebrates including corals  <cit> . however, other studies have revealed that neither reproductive mode  <cit>  nor larval competency  <cit>  are reliable predictors of levels of genetic connectivity. to further complicate matters, many coral species display a range of sexual and asexual reproductive modes that may vary geographically even within the same species  <cit> . also, complex morphological species boundaries  <cit> , hybridisation  <cit>  and cryptic speciation  all contribute to make population genetic studies in corals a daunting task.

pocillopora damicornis is a common scleractinian coral, found on tropical coral reefs throughout the indo-pacific region  <cit> . it has been extensively studied and its reproductive modes and population genetic structures are well documented in many geographic locations. as with its pocilloporid congener seriatorpora hystrix  <cit>  its morphological species status is currently under question, with two genetically distinct but morphologically indistinguishable types  occurring in sympatry on reefs in the western indian ocean . it is a hermaphroditic species, which can reproduce both sexually and asexually  <cit> . sexual reproduction occurs primarily by internal brooding and release of mature planulae, although broadcast spawning has been reported from western australia  <cit>  and the eastern pacific  <cit> . its asexual reproduction is thought to occur primarily through ameiotic production of brooded larvae, parthenogenesis  <cit> . population genetic studies of p. damicornis indicate that populations that are influenced by asexual reproduction are less panmictic  <cit>  than populations that rely mostly on sexual reproduction  <cit> . however, small scale sub-divisions have been reported within populations of putative sexual origin in the eastern indian ocean  <cit>  and at lord howe island  <cit> . in general, dispersal of asexual planulae has been calculated to occur at spatial scales of up to  <dig> km  <cit> , whereas gene flow between sexually reproducing populations has been reported over distances of up to  <dig> km  <cit> . interestingly, sexually reproducing populations have been found to show more differentiation at small spatial scales, such as between reef habitats, than over distances of thousands of km  <cit> . however, long distance dispersal between reefs on the gbr and high latitude coral reefs further south is apparently exceedingly rare  <cit> 

like most pocilloporid corals, p. damicornis exhibits low tolerance to elevated sea surface temperatures  <cit>  and on surveyed reefs along the coast of kenya more than 75%  of all colonies suffered bleaching-induced mortality as a consequence of the extreme el ninõ event in  <dig>  <cit> . however, pocilloporid corals are effective colonisers of available space on reefs and recent studies indicate that pocilloporid larvae dominate settlement on artificial settlement tiles in the mombasa marine national park and reserve  <cit>  and new recruits  were found along the entire coast of kenya by  <dig>  <cit> . as an effective colonist, this species is important to study in relation to recovery of degraded reefs in east africa.

the coast of east africa displays a mixture of fringing-, rock island- and patch-reefs. from malindi to kisite in kenya, the coast is lined by an almost unbroken fringing reef, behind which extensive lagoonal reefs are found  <cit> . further south, along the coast of tanzania, the reefs are patchier and rock island reefs are found around the islands of pemba, zanzibar and mafia.

this study was implemented with the aim of examining population genetic patterns in the nf-type of p. damicornis at different spatial scales along the coast of east africa. levels of connectivity were inferred at evolutionary and contemporary time scales and related to geographic distance among and between reefs as well as the physical location and habitat of the sampled populations. due to the lack of basic ecological data relating to the reefs included in this study, the underlying project was of an exploratory nature and not hypothesis driven. as a result the discussion is organised around results rather than addressing specific issues or hypothesis.

RESULTS
from an initial  <dig> sites and  <dig> genotyped colonies,  <dig> nf-type colonies from  <dig> sites were included in the full study . two loci  showed evidence of containing null alleles at  <dig> and  <dig> sites respectively. however, as use of the corrected dataset did not significantly alter the resulting f-statistics , the original data set was retained to enable comparisons with the results from the exclusion tests. significant overall genotypic linkage disequilibrium was found between locus pv <dig> and pd2_ <dig> and between pv <dig> and pd3_ <dig>  at the population level, this disequilibrium was only significant in  <dig>  or  <dig>  of the  <dig> populations. fst outlier tests revealed a signature of positive selection in locus pd3_ <dig> . however, all significance tests for the f-statistics were done by bootstrapping over loci and the exclusion of locus pd3_ <dig> from the analysis did not alter the results. as a result, pd3_ <dig> was included in the study to maximise the power of the analyses. the ratio of unique multi locus genotypes to sampled colonies equalled  <dig>  within all sampled populations but an identical multi-locus genotype was shared between dt  <dig> and mtw <dig> . numbers of alleles per loci ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> , and all loci displayed a significant population differentiation  and a significant deficit of heterozygotes  . site specific diversity measures showed similar patterns of high allelic and genetic diversity across all sampled populations. a significant heterozygote deficiency was found in  <dig> of the  <dig> sampled populations .

total number of sampled colonies , number of nf-types , average number of alleles per locus , expected  and observed  heterozygotisy. bold fis-values indicate a significant departure from hardy-weinberg equilibrium . the four groups of populations included in the amova are mmp 1– <dig>  pem 1– <dig>  maf 1– <dig> and mtw 1– <dig> 

values in bold show significant deviations from the hardy-weinberg equilibrium 

between population differentiation accounted for  <dig> % of the overall deviation from hwe   with 34%  of all pairwise population comparisons showing significant differentiation . the degree of isolation varied, with some sites  being significantly differentiated from over 88% of all other sites sampled, while others  were in hwe with  <dig> of the other  <dig> sites . the principal component analysis  further illustrated the differentiation of malindi along the first axis, ze  <dig> and zw  <dig> along the second axis and mmp <dig> along the third axis, with the addition of maf  <dig> . by removing malindi from this analysis, pem  <dig> and ze  <dig> were differentiated along the first and second axis . the results of the amova showed that the level of isolation did not increase with increased spatial scales but rather that sample subdivision was greater among sites within groups  than among groups , with no significant deviation from hwe found at the larger spatial scale . mantel tests of the reduced major axis regression analysis showed no significant correlation between log  and log  distance among all sites , nor among sites within any of the seven groups . this remained the case also after excluding highly divergent sites such as malindi, mmp  <dig>  ze  <dig> and zw  <dig> .

exclusion tests revealed that  <dig> colonies  had a probability of less than  <dig>  of being derived from within the site at which they were sampled . out of these,  <dig> colonies had a probability of being derived from a genetically divergent, sampled site of >  <dig> . six populations  showed no signs of recent immigration and mnemba conservation area near zanzibar  was found to be the most likely source population for six colonies sampled across the entire geographic range of the study .

occurrence of f-types  showed no consistent pattern or correlation to any obvious difference in habitat and the proportion of the f-types sampled at each site varied from  <dig>  to 100%  .

discussion
population genetic patterns
it is important to emphasise that although a very small amount of migration is enough to counteract genetic drift, not rejecting panmixia does not equate to open populations that are capable of seeding degraded neighbouring or distant reefs. in fact, replenishing severely depleted populations requires hundreds or thousands of successful migrants per generation  <cit> . conversely, given enough samples and loci, almost any pair of data will be significantly different unless there is complete panmixia. the impact of cryptic speciation on this study resulted in a somewhat diminished dataset. naturally this had an affect on the power of the statistics employed, as does the fact that only six microsatellite loci are available and produced acceptable results. nonetheless, according to simulations by kalinowski  <cit> , the significance of fst values derived from  <dig> loci with an average of  <dig> alleles per loci  results in a coefficient of variation of <  <dig> , suggesting that the power of the statistics employed herein with is sufficient.

due to the difference in polymorphism between allozymes and microsatellites, a direct comparison between reported fst values from previous spatial genetic studies is inappropriate  <cit> . however, the variable levels of dispersal that were found between populations examined in this study are consistent with earlier findings from a range of coral species  and previous studies of genetic connectivity in marine invertebrates from the coast of east africa, which have all reported gene flow over distances of hundreds of kilometres  <cit> . small scale population differentiation, such as that found between sites within groups in this study, has previously been reported for this species  <cit>  and other brooding corals such as seriatopora hystrix  <cit>  and could be attributed to localised recruitment, due to short dispersal distances of brooded larvae, or site specific selection, which may not be equally apparent when groups of populations are compared over larger distances.

for the purpose of managing coral reef ecosystems, processes at ecological time scales need to be separated from those at evolutionary time scales  <cit> . this can be achieved by exclusion and assignment tests, which have been found to provide a relevant measure of contemporary gene flow  <cit> . as only a minuscule proportion of the total number of populations was sampled for this study, the assignment of individuals to "home" should be interpreted with some caution. with that in mind, results from exclusion tests suggest that contemporary dispersal between populations occurs at both spatial scales. however, it does not occur among or between all sampled populations, which concurs with the variable levels of divergence indicated by the f-statistics. exclusion tests further increased the number of potentially isolated reefs by showing that six reefs show no signs of first generation migrants. mmp  <dig> was the only site that showed consistent genetic isolation at both evolutionary and contemporary time scales. mmp  <dig>  which is a reef slope site off bamburi beach, was isolated from nearby lagoonal populations, corroborating previous results for the massive coral platygyra daedalea  <cit> . furthermore, and in accordance with what was found in p. daedalea  <cit> , mmp  <dig> was not significantly differentiated from the only other reef slope site sampled along the fringing reef of the kenyan coast . the results from these two studies may indicate that dispersal is limited between the reef slope and lagoon in this region, while gene flow occurs along the outer reef slope. a similar pattern of differentiation between lagoonal and reef slope sites was found by benzie et al  <cit>  who proposed that differential selection acting at the two habitats could be a plausible explanation. however, as reef slope sites sampled in this study are not consistently differentiated from lagoonal sites and as five out of the six studied loci show no evidence of being functional and hence are not prone to selection, this hypothesis is unlikely to explain the differentiation. another possible explanation may be found in local hydrodynamic patterns, such as the impact of boundary currents at the reef edge. boundary currents arise by a decoupling of inshore and offshore currents and are generated on the great barrier reef when wind and current directions are opposed  <cit> . such a decoupling would result in limited across shelf mixing, which would hamper larval dispersal across reef shelves, while maintaining dispersal in a north – south direction. however, as no detailed, small scale hydrodynamic data is published from this region, this hypothesis remains un-tested.

a lack of successful dispersal from southerly reefs may explain the divergence of malindi from other sampled populations. malindi was found to be genetically isolated from the southerly lagoonal reefs, , also in p. daedalea  <cit> . studies from the western indian ocean suggest that coral reproduction primarily occurs during the northeast monsoon between october and march  <cit> . along the coast of kenya this monsoon counteracts and slows down the north flowing east african coastal current, which may hamper long distance dispersal of larvae and give rise to more isolated populations further north. conversely, results from the exclusion tests indicate that  <dig> out of  <dig> colonies may be first generation migrants. with such a high proportion of recent migrants, the inferred level of differentiation between malindi and other sites may potentially be eroded, assuming that the current populations persist. a more extensive data set, which includes additional reefs in this area, would undoubtedly reveal more information regarding this genetic break and may shed light on the underlying ecological or physiological processes that drive this divergence.

mnemba conservation area on the northeast tip of unguja island, zanzibar  is genetically differentiated from all sites except dar  <dig> and maf  <dig>  yet is the most likely source population for  <dig> of the  <dig> detected first generation migrants in the data set. this population has the highest genetic diversity, and hence has an increased likelihood of being perceived as the source population of colonies harbouring alleles that are rare or absent in other populations. another population on zanzibar  is equally isolated, indicating that these two sites, along with mmp  <dig>  harbour predominantly self seeding populations.

surveys conducted after the  <dig> coral bleaching event showed that reefs off the coast of dar es salaam were not significantly affected by the bleaching; in fact, hard coral cover increased between  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . despite this obvious difference in recent bottleneck and founder events, these populations  show a similar level of genetic diversity and variable levels of differentiation to the recently depleted populations in kenya, with no significant differentiation between the two sites and genetic similarity to a majority of the other sampled sites.

all four sites from mafia are sampled within chole bay and within a kilometre of each other. no pairwise comparisons within the group showed significant differentiation, nor are they significantly differentiated to other sampled sites with the exception of the six isolated sites discussed earlier. no comparative data from before and after the  <dig> coral bleaching event is available for chole bay on mafia. however, hard coral cover was reported to be 30% in  <dig>  which would suggest that bleaching had not significantly affected these reefs  <cit> .

despite the relatively large geographic distance between the sites at mtwara and the other reefs, significant differentiation was only found between these sites and the isolated sites of malindi, mmp  <dig>  ze  <dig> and zw  <dig> as well as dt  <dig>  hence, sufficient gene flow to counteract the effects of random genetic drift seemingly occurs at spatial scales of up to  <dig> km . the exclusion test further reveals that first generation migrants are likely to have dispersed from mtwara to zanzibar, a distance of over  <dig> km. if dispersal occurs primarily through a stepping stone model, a significant isolation by distance should, in theory, be apparent. however, this was not found to be the case for this dataset. significant isolation by distance has been detected at spatial scales similar to those between sites within groups  for the brooding corals balanophyllia elegans  <cit>  and seriatopora hystrix  <cit> . the results obtained from the present study revealed a more disordered genetic structure with no significant correlations between genetic and geographic distances at either of the two spatial scales. such "chaotic genetic patchiness" is commonly reported in marine invertebrates. this phenomena is explained by factors such as pre- or post-settlement selection and different genetic origins of settling larvae  <cit> . indeed, long distance dispersal, coupled with site specific selection or small scale hydrodynamic patterns, would serve to explain the fact that distant groups of samples, separated by over  <dig> km, show a higher degree of similarity than sites within groups that are sampled at geographic scales of  <dig>  –  <dig> km. at larger spatial scales, a lack of correlation between genetic and geographic distance may be attributed to a higher impact of genetic drift, whereas at very small spatial scales gene flow may not be sufficiently unidirectional to cause a significant correlation  <cit> . further support for the chaotic genetic patchiness theory is derived from the heterozygote deficiencies and population specific linkage disequilibria. a majority of the sampled populations and loci showed a significant deficit of heterozygotes. the exception to this finding is locus pd3_ <dig> , which appears to be in hwe. as the presence and potential impact of null alleles could not explain this large deficit across all loci and populations, other theoretical explanations are needed. in most coral genetic studies, a heterozygote deficit is explained by inbreeding and non-random mating  <cit> . however, a heterozygote deficiently coupled with high genetic diversity and population specific linkage disequilibrium may indicate recent admixture. indeed, several recent studies have incorporated admixture and spatial and temporal variability of larval sources in the explanation  <cit>  and it is widely accepted that population genetic structure can be affected by temporal variability in recruitment sources and rates  <cit> . the variable impact of coral bleaching on these reefs  may well cause a temporal shift in source populations as population sizes fluctuate over time. hence, the results of this study, which includes multiple cohorts and populations impacted by recent founder events, is likely to be affected by spatially and temporally variable recruitment events, which in turn would cause a deficit of heterozygotes across both loci and populations. also, many locations and reefs remain un-sampled and the structure of the hierarchal sampling design would be greatly improved by increasing the number of sites at the smaller geographical scales. despite this, the data provides important information from many previously un-studied reef areas and is the most comprehensive study of population genetic patterns of reef building corals in the western indian ocean to date.

the f-types
in a separate study, colonies of p. damicornis were genetically characterised at one nuclear and two mitochondrial sequence markers and six microsatellite loci. both genomes support the existence of two reciprocally monophyletic clusters of wio origin indicative of two reproductively isolated species within p. damicornis. some interesting observations regarding the  <dig> colonies that were found to belong to the f-types and hence excluded from the population genetic statistics are worth reporting here. the most striking difference related to the prevalence of asexual reproduction, which would suggest that the two types differ in their preferred, or most commonly utilised, reproductive mode. among the f-types,  <dig> colonies out of  <dig> were found to belong to  <dig> clonal lineages , while among the nf-types, only a single identical multi-locus genotype was encountered among the  <dig> samples.

also, the fact that no nf-types were sampled at kanamai reef indicates a lack of successful recruitment onto this reef. the lagoon at kanamai is very shallow and has the most extreme temperature variations recorded among kenyan lagoonal reefs  <cit> . during low tide, much of the reef is exposed or submerged in water that reaches temperatures of above 34°c. unlike other surveyed reefs, kanamai lagoon showed no significant decline in hard coral cover following the extreme el ninõ event of  <dig>  <cit> . in addition, it hosted the only recorded, remnant population of p. damicornis along the coast of kenya  <cit> , which may suggest that the f-types are better adapted to the prevailing conditions at kanamai.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the spatial genetic patterns reported in this study indicate a variable degree of isolation of populations at both ecological and evolutionary time scales, with certain sites showing a high degree of connectivity and others relying mostly on self seeding. the results highlight the importance of identifying and protecting reefs that harbour high levels of genetic biodiversity and that act as potential source reefs, such as mnemba conservation area on zanzibar. it also provided further evidence that certain reef slope sites are unique, such as mmp  <dig>  which was shown to be isolated from closely positioned lagoonal populations in the mombasa marine national park and reserve in both the present study as well as previous studies of another species of coral . without a doubt, the incorporation of ecological, hydrodynamic and temporal data into the spatial genetic studies would provide a more comprehensive picture of reef connectivity in this region and improve management decisions and conservation efforts. unfortunately, such data is yet largely unavailable for most of the reefs in the wio region despite the vital role these ecosystems play both as biodiversity hot spots as well as by providing essential goods and services for rapidly growing coastal towns and communities.
