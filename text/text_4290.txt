BACKGROUND
the ethiopian highlands constitute the largest continuous mountain system in africa. these highlands are a biodiversity hotspot  <cit> , particularly for amphibians as ~40 % of the species found in the highlands are endemic  <cit> . the ethiopian highlands are split by the great rift valley  in two systems of plateaus and mountains: the western highlands  and the eastern highlands . the grv is the result of the splitting of the african plate into two, which began ~ <dig> my ago  <cit> . the climatic conditions on the highlands are relatively cool and humid while the grv and the low-elevation areas surrounding the highlands are dry and hot, but this was not always the case. since the late miocene, the climate of east africa has become increasingly arid and unstable  <cit> , with dry periods alternating with wet ones , coinciding with glaciations at northern latitudes  <cit> . for the last glacial maximum  different global circulation models, such as those used in this work , predict cooler and wetter conditions for east africa, including the ethiopian highlands . these climatic cycles are expected to have promoted changes in the connectivity across the grv and thus affected the possibility of gene flow between the western and eastern highlands. during drier periods the grv could have acted as a barrier to dispersal for highland-adapted species as their distribution was being pushed to higher elevations. when the climate was wetter, however, highland species could have expanded their distribution toward low elevations and could have eventually dispersed across the grv.

the effect the grv had on population structure has been investigated in a handful of species, including charismatic taxa such as the ethiopian wolf, the gelada baboon and the giant lobelia . in all species examined, there is a clear genetic break between populations situated on the east and the west of the grv, suggesting the rift constitutes a major barrier to dispersal in these organisms. however, the east-west genetic break is recent in the ethiopian wolf and probably followed the last de-glaciation event  <dig>  years ago  <cit> , whereas populations of the frogs xenopus clivii and x. largeni have been isolated on each sides of the rift for ~1– <dig>  million years, with little or no migration  <cit> . at this point, the significance of the grv as a biogeographic barrier has been examined in a very small number of species and further comparative studies are necessary to determine how the rift valley has affected dispersal in organisms with different ecological requirements.

we decided to examine the impact the grv has had on the population structure of seven frog species with different ecology, behavior and habitat preference: amietia sp., leptopelis gramineus, tomopterna kachowskii, ptychadena cooperi, p. erlangeri and two recently identified cryptic species, p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  <cit> . the systematics of frogs belonging to the genus amietia is still debated. although populations from ethiopia have been assigned to the species amietia angolensis  <cit> , it is highly likely that this name recovers a species complex  <cit>  and that ethiopian populations belong to a separate species. we refer to those frogs as amietia sp. until their systematics has been resolved. amietia sp. is relatively abundant on the ethiopian plateaus, east and west of the rift, and is exclusively found along large perennial streams  <cit> . based on our observations, amietia sp. is absent from the grv and from the low elevation areas surrounding the ethiopian highlands. leptopelis gramineus is a fossorial and secretive species which is endemic to ethiopia  <cit> . this species is commonly found on the plateaus but it can also reach high elevations, having been reported in the afro-alpine habitat. it is also found in the tropical humid forests of the kaffa zone  and in the forests flanking the southern portion of the eastern highlands, only avoiding dry areas, such as the floor of the grv. tomopterna kachowskii is endemic to the horn of africa and belongs to a genus commonly referred as sand frogs  <cit> . it has been collected at intermediate elevations on both side of the grv and on the floor of the grv, indicating it can tolerate dry conditions  <cit> . frogs of this genus are known to survive dry conditions by digging burrows in sandy soils  where they can aestivate for extended periods of time  <cit> . the four ptychadena species analyzed here have a very low tolerance to dry conditions and are therefore absent from savannas and other arid environments. ptychadena cf. neumanni  <dig> and  <dig> are typical grassland species that differ by their elevational range; p. cf, neumanni  <dig> is found exclusively below 2500 m while p. cf. neumanni  <dig> occurs between  <dig> and 3100 m. ptychadena cf. neumanni  <dig> is also found in clearings in the tropical humid forests of kaffa. ptychadena erlangeri is typically found in the moist evergreen forests of the kaffa zone where it occurs in sympatry with p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  although these two species differ in size and tend to occupy different micro-habitats  <cit> . ptychadena cooperi is the largest species of the genus analyzed here. it is found at elevations between  <dig> and 3100 m and favors slow-running streams and large ponds. we performed a phylogeographic analysis of these seven taxa using a combination of mitochondrial and nuclear loci and we inferred the impact the grv has had on their genetic structure. results from phylogeographic analyses were complemented with the estimation of the changes in habitat suitability that occurred between the present time and the last glacial maximum , as assessed by means of ecological niche modeling  <cit> .

RESULTS
highland species: amietia sp., ptychadena cooperi and ptychadena cf. neumanni 2

ptychadena cf. neumanni  <dig>  p. cooperi and amietia sp. were collected in the ethiopian highlands, on both sides of the grv, at elevations between  <dig> and 3087 m asl. although these three species are found in the same elevational range, they differ considerably in their use of microhabitats. ptychadena cf. neumanni  <dig> was collected in flooded grasslands, while amietia sp. was found exclusively in large perennial streams. ptychadena cooperi was always found near water, usually large ponds and slow running streams and rarely in flooded grasslands and never in the large streams favored by amietia sp.

ecological niche models  for these three species showed high auc values, particularly for ptychadena cf. neumanni  <dig> and p. cooperi . predicted distribution ranges for the present time were similar among the three species and indicate that current favorable conditions are limited to the highlands . enms indicated that the grv is not a suitable area for any of these species at the present time. projection of the enms for the lgm suggested that populations of p. cooperi and amietia sp. east and west of the grv could have been connected, whereas the grv was probably not climatically suitable for p. cf. neumanni  <dig> .table  <dig> number of occurrence data  employed for the enm and auc evaluation metric of the enm for the different species

all phylogenetic analyses of the mitochondrial sequences revealed similar patterns between the three species, with a clear clustering of mitochondrial haplotypes from the same side of the grv . in p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  the  <dig> mitochondrial haplotypes cluster into two well supported clades corresponding perfectly to the geographical origin of the samples, one clade containing all the frogs collected in the west and the other one the frogs from the east of the grv . in amietia sp., we recovered a similar east-west split but we identified a divergent clade corresponding to populations located north of the blue nile valley . in p. cooperi, we recovered only  <dig> haplotypes,  <dig> of which are unique to the west . the western haplotypes form a monophyletic clade, which is nested within a paraphyletic eastern group. the two eastern haplotypes have distinct geographic distribution, one being widespread on the plateau while the most divergent one is found at high elevation in the bale massif. the average divergence between the western and the eastern populations are similar among species with values of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % in amietia sp., p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and p. cooperi, respectively. the amovas based on the mitochondrial data confirm the east-west split since a significant amount of the variance was explained by among group variation, the groups being defined as the populations east and west of the grv .fig.  <dig> mitochondrial phylogeny of ethiopian anurans constructed using beast, maps of ethiopia showing collecting localities and pictures of the organisms. the numbers at the nodes correspond to posterior probability values. trees are not to scale

the amount of nuclear variation differs substantially among species and tends to be higher in p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  than in p. cooperi  and amietia sp. , which exhibit similar level of variation . despite an overall low level of variation, the nuclear datasets contain significant phylogeographic information, including a number of snps that are diagnostic of the populations east and west of the grv. for instance, a snp in rag- <dig> is diagnostic of the western populations of p. cooperi and two snps in bdnf and tyr are diagnostic of the western population in amietia sp.. consistent with the presence of population-specific snps, the structure and structurama analyses strongly support the existence of two gene pools separated by the grv in all three species . the genetic differentiation between east and west is also confirmed by the amova analysis , which estimated that a large and significant fraction of the genetic variance is found among groups. finally, the f
st values calculated on a concatenated nuclear dataset are high and significant for all species . together, the mitochondrial and nuclear data strongly support the presence of two distinct geographic populations separated by the grv. the presence of a third population north of the nile in amietia sp. was not recovered by the structurama and structure analyses, probably because of the small number of loci used and the low nuclear variation recovered in this species. however, the high and significant f
st values  suggest that the population north of the nile is indeed genetically differentiated from the other two .table  <dig> summary statistics of diversity and differentiation for mitochondrial and nuclear genes

the beast estimates of divergence time between the east and west mitochondrial lineages are similar among species and suggests a split ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  my ago, in the mid-pleistocene . the *beast analyses, which take into account the coalescent of the mitochondrial and nuclear loci, produced similar estimates among species and support divergences in the pleistocene,  <dig>  to  <dig>  my ago . the beast estimates tend to be older than the *beast estimates but this is expected since divergence between alleles pre-dates population divergence. finally, the east-west split estimated with g-phocs , using only the nuclear genes and a different mutation rate than *beast, yielded close estimates from  <dig>  to  <dig>  my. the estimates of divergence of the northern populations of amietia sp. were different across methods, with a beast estimate at  <dig>  my, a *beast estimate at  <dig>  my and a g-phocs estimate at  <dig>  my. this is likely caused by the discordance between the large mitochondrial divergence and the low level of differentiation observed at nuclear loci.table  <dig> time of divergence

the estimates of effective population size differ among species , which is consistent with the substantial differences in genetic diversity at all loci . the estimates of population size for p. cooperi and amietia sp. are similar but in both species the population sizes on the east  are substantially higher than on the west . the same pattern is observed in p. cf. neumanni  <dig> but the difference is much larger since the estimate of population size in the east is five times larger than the western one . migration rates estimated by g-phocs are extremely low in all three species with 95 % credible intervals containing  <dig> for both east-to-west and west-to-east estimates suggesting that the eastern and western populations have not exchanged migrants at a detectable level since their split . the ebsp analysis  performed on the western population of p. cf. neumanni  <dig> suggests that this population experienced a rapid 10-fold increase in population size in the last  <dig>  years. the ebsps performed on the western population of p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  amietia sp. and p. cooperi are all indicative of a stable demography . however, the low amount of genetic variation in these populations is probably insufficient to accurately reconstruct the demographic history of these species and will require the acquisition of data from a large number of fast-evolving nuclear loci.fig.  <dig> demographic trajectories estimated by extended bayesian skyline plot . the median population size is shown with a black line and the 95 % credible intervals are shown with grey lines




a fossorial frog from the grasslands and the forests: leptopelis gramineus
thirty-four specimens of leptopelis gramineus were collected from  <dig> localities,  <dig> on the western side of the grv and  <dig> on the eastern side . the sampling sites on the east include  <dig> grassland localities ranging from  <dig> to 3000 m asl and  <dig> localities in the tropical humid forest flanking the southern side of the eastern highlands, at elevations ~ <dig> to ~2400 m. five of the western localities were in highland grasslands between ~ <dig> and ~2800 m asl whereas a single locality 30 km south west of jimma was in a humid tropical forest at an elevation of ~2100 m. enms for l. gramineus showed good prediction ability  and indicated that current favorable climatic conditions are limited to the highlands and to the humid forests of the south . enms indicate that while the grv is currently not favorable for the species, it might have been suitable during the lgm .fig.  <dig>

all phylogenetic reconstructions based on the coi gene produced identical topologies indicative of four well-supported and highly divergent mitochondrial lineages , with defined geographic distributions. the average distance between these clades is high, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  %. one of the clades includes all haplotypes from the west side of the grv whereas three clades are found in the east: a clade found on the arsi plateau and at high elevations in the bale massif , a clade found exclusively near kasha in the harenna forest  and a clade found in the forest of the southernmost portion of the eastern massif, near the town of kibre mengist . interestingly the western clade is nested within the three eastern clades, which do not form a monophyletic group. consistent with a clear east-west break and with the presence of divergent mitochondrial lineages in the east, the amova reveals that 52 % of the mitochondrial variation is explained by differences between the east and the west of the grv and 34 % by differences among populations within groups .

the level of nuclear variation in l. gramineus is comparatively higher than in other species with a total of  <dig> snps. although the number of snps is large, a single one  separates the populations west and east of the grv. the structure analysis supports the presence of two populations, separated by the grv, by the delta-k criterion but six populations by the pr criterion. the pr criterion also separates the individuals of the western side of the grv but does not reveal any biologically meaningful structure in the samples from the east. consistent with the structure analysis, structurama recovers the same east-west split . interestingly, the clustering approaches did not recover any genetic structure in the east, although the mitochondrial analysis suggested the presence of three distinct populations. the amova performed on the  <dig> nuclear genes confirmed the validity of the east-west break and the lack of strong structure within each group, as only  <dig>  % of the variation is explained by variation among populations . f
st  calculated between the western population and each of the eastern populations yielded high and significant values  whereas f
st among eastern populations defined by their mitochondrial lineage yielded much lower, yet significant, values . taken together, the analyses of the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets strongly indicate a clear genetic break between the eastern and western populations of l. gramineus as well as additional genetic structure between the eastern populations from the plateau and the populations from the tropical forests.

beast estimated that the four mitochondrial lineages diverged in the pliocene, between  <dig>  and  <dig>  my . the species tree approach yielded a different topology than the mitochondrial gene trees, the western population being the most divergent one and the three eastern populations forming a monophyletic group, as well as more recent divergence time . *beast estimates the split between the western and the eastern populations in the early pleistocene . the divergence between the three eastern populations is dated at ~ <dig>  to  <dig>  my. the g-phocs estimates of divergence are similar to the one obtained with *beast with an east-west divergence dated ~ <dig>  my in the early pleistocene .

the g-phocs estimates of effective population size are consistent across priors and relatively similar among populations, ranging from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig> , <dig> individuals . however, an ebsp analysis of the arsi population suggests a 10-fold demographic expansion starting ~  <dig>  year ago . a population expansion for arsi is also supported by tajima’s d and fu’s f, which yielded negative values for all loci , although few values were significant. the migration rates estimated by g-phocs between the east and west populations are not significantly different from  <dig>  indicating that the western and eastern populations have apparently not exchanged migrants at a detectable level for a very long time .

lower elevation species: ptychadena erlangeri, p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and tomopterna kachowskii

ptychadena erlangeri was collected in forest clearings, in the southwest and in two localities east of the grv. the distribution of p. cf. neumanni  <dig> is limited to the west of the grv where it occupies grassland habitats under 2500 m but its distribution extends to the forests of the southwest where it coexists with p. erlangeri. tomopterna kachowskii were collected across a large range of elevations  and habitats  on both side of the grv.

enms for these species indicated distinct distribution ranges for the present time and different range dynamics since the lgm . evaluation metrics for these models showed good prediction ability for p. erlangeri and p. cf. neumanni  <dig> but moderate for t. kachowskii . the predicted distribution for p. erlangeri includes the forests of kaffa as well as the forests that are flanking the southern side of the eastern highlands. interestingly the model predicts the presence of a corridor of favorable habitat crossing the grv, south of awassa and north of lake abaya, suggesting a possible connection between populations east and west of the rift . according to the projection of enms, this species could have had a similar but somewhat more widespread distribution during the lgm than in the present time. enms for p. cf. neumanni  <dig> suggest that favorable habitat for this species currently exists almost exclusively on the west side of the grv and includes the entire western massif, excluding the highest elevation mountains. it also extends south, reaching the northern portion of the tropical forest of kaffa. for the lgm, enms indicate that there could have been suitable areas for p. cf. neumanni  <dig> on the eastern highlands and that the western and eastern highlands could have been connected by suitable habitats. consistent with our observations and what is known of the ecology of this species, enms predict that the distribution of t. kachowskii is continuous in the lowlands and extends on the flanks of the highlands, but does not include the highest elevation areas. a similar distribution pattern is predicted for the lgm.

phylogenetic analyses of the coi gene in p. erlangeri and t. kachowskii revealed that haplotypes do not group on the phylogenies according to geography. instead, eastern and western samples are interspersed over the phylogenies . this is confirmed by the amova analyses based on mitochondrial sequences which indicated that most of the variation is found within populations and that among group variation does not contribute to the overall genetic variance between populations east and west of the grv . in p. erlangeri, two deeply divergent lineages were recovered in  <dig> individuals from the forests of the southwest. these two lineages differ on average from the main clade by  <dig>  and  <dig>  %, respectively . this amount of divergence is unusual within species, yet the persistence of ancestral mitochondrial lineages in frog populations has been observed in other taxa . it should be noted that the frogs carrying these divergent lineages come from localities where the main clade was recovered and that they are undistinguishable from other p. erlangeri with respect to morphology or nuclear variation.

in p. erlangeri and t. kachowskii, all the nuclear genes revealed the same patterns, i.e. extensive allele sharing between populations on the east and the west side of the grv, and the level of differentiation between east and west estimated by fst were low and non-significant at all loci . the structure analysis determined that the most likely number of populations in these two species was  <dig> based on the pr criterion and as  <dig> by the delta-k criterion, which is not designed to chose the best value of k when k <  <dig> . similarly, the structurama analysis provides strong support in favor of a single population . finally the amova analyses based on the nuclear datasets indicate that the vast majority of the variation is found within population  . clearly, all the methods used to detect genetic structure in p. erlangeri and t. kachowskii, using either the mitochondrial or the nuclear datasets, demonstrate that these species consist of a single gene pool and that the grv has no impact on their genetic structure.

in p. cf. neumanni  <dig>  the only species limited to the western side of the grv, we also failed to find any population structure. the mitochondrial phylogeny did not reveal any geographic grouping  and the structurama and structure analyses strongly supported the presence of a single gene pool . in addition, f
st calculated between all pairs of population were consistently lower than  <dig>  confirming the lack of genetic structure in this species .

the estimates of population size calculated with bpp are highly consistent across priors and are similar among taxa, from ~ <dig>  in p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and t. kachowskii to ~ <dig>  in p. erlangeri. the demographic trajectory constructed with ebsp looks similar among the three low elevation species and suggests a progressive 10-fold population expansion beginning ~ <dig>  years ago, identical to the expansion observed in l. gramineus . a past population expansion is also supported by the fact that almost all values of tajima’s d and fu’s f are negative for the mitochondrial and nuclear genes .

discussion
we reconstructed the evolutionary history of seven frog species with different elevational and ecological preferences and we examined the impact the grv has had on their population structure. our results can be summarized as follow:  in species that are found at high elevations , populations east and west of the grv are genetically distinct;  in species that are found at elevations under 2500 m  there is no genetic differentiation between populations on each side of the grv;  genetic variation differs considerably among ethiopian frog species suggesting differences in effective population size and demographic history;  several species  exhibit the signature of a gradual demographic expansion starting ~ <dig>  years ago.

before further discussing our results, a word of caution is necessary. the number of genes analyzed here is relatively small and the amount of variation at nuclear protein coding genes is low, particularly in amietia sp. and p. cooperi. in addition, there is some uncertainty about mutation rates in frogs, particularly for nuclear genes. thus, estimates of divergence time or effective population size need to be interpreted with caution. with these caveats in mind, it remains that our most significant results do not rely on mutation rates. the mitochondrial phylogeny, the structure and structurama analyses and the amova all support a role of the grv in the splitting of the four highland species into two gene pools. similarly, the mitochondrial and nuclear datasets are congruent in showing a lack of structure in species distributed at elevations lower than 2500 m. it is unlikely that more data would contradict these conclusions, although additional analyses could yield more accurate estimates of the timing of population subdivision and the effective population size of our focal species. in addition, it should be acceptable to compare variation and relative divergence among species since the nature of the datasets used here are comparable across species, comprising  <dig> protein-coding mitochondrial gene and a combination of  <dig> to  <dig> nuclear genes.

our analysis emphasizes the role of the grv as a biogeographic barrier for highland adapted species. we demonstrated that the grv has prevented gene flow between eastern and western populations for the last ~ <dig>  my in amietia sp., p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and p. cooperi and for the last  <dig>  my in l. gramineus. the absence of recent gene flow can easily be explained by the current climatic conditions in the floor of the grv that are not favorable to any of the highland species . however, the population divergences we dated in the early to mid-pleistocene suggest that the climatic oscillations of the last  <dig>  my did not result in any detectable gene flow between the east and the west of the grv. ecological niche models for the lgm indicate that climatic conditions in the grv were not favorable for some species  but that they could have been for others , yet did not result in substantial migration . thus, climate alone does not fully explain the persistence of genetic differentiation in highland species. another factor that could have played a role is the topography of the grv, in particular the steep slopes in its upper portions. the margins of the ethiopian grv are comparable to an 800 m wall  and are likely to constitute insurmountable barriers to dispersal for frogs. recent studies showed that mountain ridges and deep slopes can act as a dispersal barrier for amphibians , because of physiological limitations  <cit>  or because of the high energy cost of climbing steep slopes  <cit> . indeed, an effect of topography has been demonstrated in a number of frog species, including rana luteiventris  <cit> , epipedobates femoralis  <cit> , and atelopus varius  <cit> . it is highly likely that a combination of climatic and topographical factors is responsible for the pattern of divergence we report for ethiopian taxa, although it is not possible to decipher between these two factors with our data.

it remains, however, that p. cooperi, amietia sp., l. gramineus and p. cf. neumanni  <dig> are present on both side of the grv and that at some point the grv could be crossed by these species. one possibility is that in the past the floor of the grv was higher relative to the plateaus. it is well known that elevation of the grv has changed through time  <cit>  and it is plausible that the gradual down-faulting of the grv’s floor resulted in the formation of a vicariant barrier, splitting the distribution of these species in two. an alternative possibility is that the conditions in ethiopia were sufficiently cool and humid until ~ <dig>  my ago and that the distribution of the species were then continuous. it is only with the increased aridification of eastern africa, particularly in the last half million year, that the grv became a true barrier to dispersal  <cit> .

it appears that the split between populations east and west of the grv is not concomitant in all species. the divergence time between east and west are similar between amietia sp., p. cf. neumanni  <dig> and p. cooperi at ~ <dig>  my but the east-west split is substantially older in l. gramineus  as in xenopus clivii and x. largeni   <cit> . these differences could be due to different dispersal abilities or to different tolerance to dry conditions. amietia sp., p. cooperi, and p. cf. neumanni  <dig> are relatively agile frogs which could easily colonize new favorable habitats whereas l. gramineus is a slow moving species which requires the persistence of moisture in soils to accommodate its fossorial ecology. frogs of the genus xenopus are exclusively aquatic and it is unlikely they are capable of long distance migrations, although they are capable of short distance dispersal on land. these differences in dispersal abilities are particularly relevant in the context of the grv since the topography of the margin of the rift could constitute a considerably more difficult barrier to dispersal for fossorial and aquatic species.

our study of amietia sp. indicates that the blue nile valley is acting as a biogeographic barrier. the enms clearly show that the climatic conditions in the valley are currently not favorable to this species but they also reveal that this was true during the last glacial maximum. the combination of extremely steep slopes  with the persistent dry conditions on the valley floor is likely to prevent dispersal of highland frogs. such a role of the blue nile valley had previously been detected in xenopus clivii and is supported by the presence of endemic species restricted north of the blue nile  and by the absence of several species that are found immediately south of the valley .

the amount of genetic variation differs considerably among species, reflecting differences in effective population size  and demographic history. the ne of the species found at low elevation  are relatively similar  and substantially higher than the ne of the highland species  which are  <dig> to  <dig> times lower . this difference is not due to a recent bottleneck in highland species since none of the values of tajima’s d and fu’s f are significantly positive and the ebsp either showed a recent demographic expansion  or demographic stability . instead, these differences are best explained by the large and gradual demographic expansion of lowland species starting ~ <dig>  year ago. this demographic trajectory is consistent with the progressive warming of east-africa in the pleistocene  <cit> , which could have resulted in the expansion of habitats favorable to lowland species  as well as causing the fragmentation of tropical forests, thus generating novel habitats to species living in clearings or in forest margins . however, it is difficult to evaluate the validity of this scenario given the number of uncertainties about the geological and climatic history of this region.


leptopelis gramineus is the exception to the trend described above, its highland population  being large  and having experienced a 10-fold demographic expansion, comparable to the one observed in lowland species. the genus leptopelis is a typical inhabitant of african tropical forests and the high elevation grasslands are not typical habitats. thus it is likely that the tropical rain forests constitute the ancestral habitat of l. gramineus  and that a niche shift occurred concomitantly or posteriorly to the split between the arsi population and the forests populations , dated at ~ <dig> my. we propose that the ecological shift from a forest to a highland habitat could have resulted in the colonization of an empty ecological niche on the plateaus and in a large demographic expansion. this hypothesis is highly speculative at this point and will require validation by additional research.

CONCLUSIONS
we found substantial genetic differentiation in highland species, demonstrating a role of the grv as a biogeographic barrier, but an absence of structure in species found below 2500 m. the absence of gene flow between highland populations for the last  <dig>  my, together with the demographic expansion of low elevation species starting around the same time, suggests a major change in the environmental conditions in ethiopia in the last half million year and is consistent with the progressive aridification of eastern africa during the pleistocene.
