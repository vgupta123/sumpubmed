BACKGROUND
during  <dig>  south africa was faced with the novel  influenza a h1n <dig> virus pandemic. as the country does not have the ability to produce influenza vaccine stocks, we had to rely on the world health organisation  and developed countries – and as expected, even developed countries did not have adequate vaccine stocks to meet their own demands. luckily, the  <dig> h1n <dig> pandemic virus caused only mild flu-like symptoms in most individuals. certain groups of people, however, were at greater risk for serious disease complications, such children and young adults, people with diabetes, pregnant women and immunocompromised individuals  <cit> . since south africa carries a high disease burden which includes one of the highest human immunodeficiency virus  prevalences in the world  <cit> , this pandemic was a serious warning for south africa to have a contingency plan in place for when the next influenza pandemic strikes. ideally, south africa should be self-sufficient; producing its own influenza vaccines to reduce morbidity and mortality in its large and relatively poor population.

even routine seasonal influenza vaccine production by the traditional egg-based technology is expensive and slow, taking up to  <dig> months to complete from the notification by who of suitable seasonal strains  <cit> . this is not ideal for a pandemic situation, or for a developing country with limited funds available. at a who meeting in cape town in  <dig>  it was suggested that developing countries will have to shift focus to alternative  vaccine production platforms to meet vaccine demand  <cit> . although these were not considered at the time, plant expression systems have significant advantages such as being safe, highly up-scalable and potentially cost-effective. the disadvantages include potentially complicated purification procedures and low recombinant protein yields  <cit> .

a number of studies have focussed on the expression of various influenza antigens in plant systems, and specifically in tobacco plants . the influenza virus surface haemagglutinin  glycoprotein, which elicits the primary neutralising immune response, is the main target for vaccine development  <cit> . shoji and colleagues  <cit>   transiently expressed ha from h3n <dig>  which was targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum , in nicotiana benthamiana <cit> . the ha product yielded ~ <dig> mg/kg fresh leaf weight . mett et al.  <cit>  also transiently expressed the a/wyoming/03/ <dig> strain ha  and neuraminidase  proteins fused to the enzyme lichenase  in n. benthamiana. the antigens were also er-targeted and yielded  <dig> mg ha/kg fw or  <dig> mg na/kg fw. the antigens produced in both of the above studies elicited ha-specific immune responses in test animals.

shoji et al.  <cit>  expressed a truncated version of plant codon-optimised ha from h5n <dig>  in n. benthamiana plants. this ha protein lacked the transmembrane domain and native signal peptide, and accumulated in the er at a level of approximately  <dig> mg/kg fw. spitsin and colleagues  <cit>  expressed h5n <dig>  ha variants in plants, implementing both apoplast and er targeting for both transient and stable transformation expression systems. the variants included a full-length ha , a shortened version that contained the major antigenic domains , a c-terminal truncated version  as well as a version lacking the n-terminal region . the  <dig> kda c-terminal truncated variant accumulated to the highest levels, up to  <dig> mg ha/kg fw and  <dig> mg ha/kg fw for transient and stable transformation expression systems, respectively. d’aoust and colleagues  <cit>  expressed ha from the a/indonesia/5/ <dig>  and the a/new caledonia/20/ <dig>  strains by means of agroinfiltration in n. benthamiana. the ha was successfully expressed as virus-like particles  budding from the plasma membranes of the plant cells, and accumulating between the plasma membrane and the cell wall. the yield of ha was about  <dig> mg/kg fw. all of the above studies confirmed that influenza ha can be expressed to high levels in plants, and that this plant-produced antigen can also induce ha-specific immune responses in animals.

as a proof of concept that plant-produced influenza vaccines are feasible for south africa, from early  <dig> we focussed on attempting to produce the ha of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus  a/viet nam/1194/ <dig> . to date, hpaiv h5n <dig> is the most virulent influenza strain, with a mortality rate of up to 60% in humans  and up to 100% in domestic birds  <cit> . although human-to-human transmission is rare, the ability of h5n <dig> to infect humans combined with its tendency to mutate is still considered to be a serious global threat . in this study, we optimised the transient expression of full length and truncated h <dig> ha variants in tobacco plants by means of agroinfiltration. we investigated targeting of the ha variants to different plant cell compartments: specifically, to the apoplastic spaces, the er, the chloroplast as well as the cytosol. we also generated stable transgenic plant lines expressing these ha variants by focusing on the expression constructs that produced high transient ha protein concentrations. immunogenicity trials with chickens and mice were conducted to determine whether the ha proteins were immunogenic, and haemagglutination and haemagglutination-inhibition  assays to determine whether the proteins were correctly configured.

RESULTS
transient expression of h <dig> in tobacco plants
we compared the transient expression of eight h5n <dig> ha constructs  in n. benthamiana plants. these constructs successfully expressed both the full-length  and truncated  forms of ha in all of the subcellular compartments tested .

the cloning sites as well as the targeted cell compartments are indicated.

expression time trials showed that optimum ha-expression levels occurred at approximately  <dig> days post infiltration . the engineered h <dig> and h5tr proteins were expressed as the uncleaved ha <dig> form, with products being approximately  <dig> kda in size. the transient expression levels as determined by western blot for the various plant cell compartments are shown in figure  <dig>  it is clear from the western blot that the highest expression of full-length ha  occurred in the apoplastic spaces , while the highest accumulation of the truncated variant  occurred in the er . these results were confirmed by three independent transient expression experiments. when protein production was scaled up by using the vacuum infiltration method on whole plants, we focussed on the two high-yielding constructs, namely ptraa-h <dig> and ptraer-h5tr. the h <dig> and h5tr proteins generated by this method were quantitated on coomassie-stained gels after sds-page by comparison to known bsa concentrations . crude extracts of the h <dig> and h5tr proteins were separated in lanes  <dig> and lane  <dig>  respectively. the expression levels obtained in these plant extracts ranged from 62– <dig> mg h5/kg fresh weight  and 300– <dig> mg h5tr/kg fw.

in order to prepare plant-produced ha for animal trials, ground plant extracts were clarified and diafiltered to enrich and concentrate ha and to perform a buffer exchange. diafiltration reduced the concentration of plant proteins, including rubisco , while retaining most of the ha protein . the final product still contained significant amounts of plant protein contaminants.

apoplast-accumulated ha protein was selectively extracted from n. benthamiana leaves 7dpi with ptraa-h <dig>  this was accomplished by infiltrating the leaves with buffer  seven days after the agroinfiltration. the buffer was then collected from the cut edges of leaves by low speed centrifugation, effectively extracting h <dig> protein from the apoplastic spaces . immobilized metal affinity chromatography was also successfully utilized to purify his-tagged h5tr protein ; however, yields were low and could not be reliably quantitated by sds-page analysis.

h <dig> expression in transgenic tobacco plants
stably transformed n. tabacum plants were generated with the ptraa-h <dig> and ptraerh-h5tr constructs. three t <dig> ptraa-h <dig> lines and ten ptraerh-h5tr lines were allowed to self-pollinate, following which ~ <dig> seeds from each line were planted. all h <dig> plant lines  were pcr-positive indicating that all three plant lines probably have multiple ha gene inserts, only three of the ten h5tr plant lines were positive by pcr. these pcr positive plant lines were found to be positive for h <dig> or h5tr protein expression by western blot analysis. gene transfer remained stable both in the second  and third generations  of h <dig> and h5tr transgenic plants, while these also successfully expressed h <dig> and h5tr, respectively . the h5tr accumulation in the stable t <dig> transgenic plants ranged from  <dig> –  <dig> mg/kg, which was lower than the levels obtained by transient expression. however, expression levels of h <dig> were higher in the stably transformed transgenic plants  than in the transient expression system. the h <dig> protein from transgenic plants was concentrated and partially purified  as described for the transiently-expressed h <dig>  the h <dig> enrichment is evident when the processed extract is compared to the crude plant extract .

haemagglutination and haemagglutination-inhibition  analyses
haemagglutination and hi tests were conducted at the national institute of communicable diseases  a national influenza centre for who, in order to determine the functionality of the plant-produced ha protein variants. the crude ptraa-h <dig> product gave a haemaglutination titre of 1: <dig> and a hi titre of 1: <dig> against h <dig> antiserum . the truncated h5tr product gave a haemaglutination titre of 1:32; however, the hi titre was inconclusive. the hi tests were repeated to confirm the results.

animal serum analysis
western blot analysis of the serum obtained from h5- and h5tr-immunised chickens showed that ha-specific antibodies were present in all the chicken sera: data are not shown due to the significant background signal observed due to chicken antibodies strongly binding the plant antigens present in the plant-produced ha preparations. sera from the pbs-immunized control animals showed no reactivity to the ha protein.

from all the h <dig> and h5tr sera tested at the nicd, only two h5tr serum samples inhibited haemagglutination by control h5n <dig> virus during hi tests  . the h <dig> elisa and hi analysis performed by the provincial veterinary laboratory were negative for h5-specific antibodies – however, the test was specific for an ostrich-derived low pathogenicity h5n <dig> virus, indicating a lack of cross-reactivity.

sera from mice that were vaccinated with the plant-produced h <dig> or h5tr were analysed by western blot utilising a purified commercial h <dig> protein as antigen . this analysis indicated that h5-specific antibodies were present in the sera from all h5-  and h5tr-  immunised mice. h <dig> specific antibodies were absent in the control sera . however, hi assays performed with the mouse sera were not conclusive, with only  <dig> of the mice vaccinated with full length h <dig> having antibody titres of 1: <dig> .

discussion
plant-produced vaccines could be the way of the future for pandemic influenza vaccine production, ever since two different groups showed that production time for a new h1n <dig> pandemic vaccine could be as short as one month from the first announcement of the pandemic strain sequence, to having the end-product ready for testing in animals  <cit> . this is significantly shorter than the  <dig> month minimum production time required for the seasonal vaccine made by egg-based technology. in addition, compared to plant-produced vaccines, egg-based vaccines also have the disadvantage that certain strains, such as h5n <dig>  do not grow well in eggs and production is severely limited  <cit> .

to illustrate the advantage for vaccine production via transient plant expression, when a deadly h3n <dig> influenza strain emerged in brisbane, australia , researchers at the fraunhofer institute  took  <dig> days to produce a purified candidate vaccine via transient expression in tobacco plants   <cit> . in addition, a canadian company  were able to obtain purified h1-vlps within  <dig> days after the initial pandemic h1n <dig> ha sequence became known  <cit> . medicago and the fraunhofer institute  also announced at the ‘influenza vaccine for the world 2009’ conference that human clinical trials will be implemented for their plant-produced ha influenza vaccines. these are currently in progress  <cit> .

in our study, we aimed to establish a platform to produce influenza a virus subunit vaccines via tobacco plants in south africa, in order to minimise the impact of a potential pandemic on our population. pre-pandemic awareness and stockpiling has also been encouraged and is deemed necessary for h5n <dig> as it is still viewed as a potential global pandemic threat due to its high mortality rate  <cit> . in this case, stable transgenic seeds can be very useful to have on standby in case of a h5n <dig> pandemic. our h <dig> and h5tr stable transgenic plant lines expressed vaccine protein at high levels for two consecutive generations – which is a first for transgenic production of influenza ha protein. when needed, these stored transgenic seeds can be planted at large scale, and the resulting transgenic plants can be used to purify h <dig> vaccines within a few weeks.

by targeting the ha variants to different plant cell compartments, we were able to determine which localities in the plant cell had the highest potential for the accumulation of our recombinant proteins. our findings from both the transient and the stable transgenic systems indicated that full-length h <dig> accumulated at the highest level in the apoplastic spaces. this may be due to the presence of the ha transmembrane domain which can allow budding from the cell membrane in the form of vlps, as observed by d’aoust et al.  <cit> . in our study, the apoplast-targeted ha also provided us with a potential alternative to leaf homogenization which should reduce contaminating plant proteins and simplify the purification process. we were able to recover h <dig> protein from h5-expressing leaf tissue by infiltrating leaves with a buffer containing a detergent , followed by low speed centrifugation of whole leaves. by using this method we were also able to extract h <dig> localised in the chloroplast or cytoplasm, but to a lesser extent . this was likely due to the presence of triton-x <dig> in the buffer, which allowed the elution of intracellular proteins by solubilising the membranes. this is an attractive alternative extraction method especially for apoplast-accumulating proteins, as it markedly reduces co-extraction of intracellular proteins and insoluble plant material.

h5tr accumulated at high levels in the er. the er is a popular target for expression of recombinant proteins, particularly glycoproteins, often resulting in high accumulation levels  <cit> . the contrasting behaviour of h5tr and h <dig> with respect to accumulation – the former high in the er and low in the apoplast, with the inverse for h <dig> – is not easily explained. it is possible that sekdel-tagged h <dig> is less stable than the h5tr equivalent.

in comparison to other studies investigating ha expression in plants  <cit> ‐ <cit>  we obtained similar transient expression levels  than previously reported . our choice of expression vector, infiltration methods and codon optimised ha gene sequence can possibly account for our high ha accumulation. although immobilized metal affinity chromatography  purification  has previously been successful for this protein  <cit> , we could not utilize the same purification strategy for our full-length h <dig>  as it did not contain a his-tag. we were able to purify the his-tagged truncated h <dig> by imac; however, our yields were too variable and too low for us to use the purified material for animal experiments. we therefore decided to generate our preliminary data using a crude concentrated and diafiltered product, in which the ha proteins were enriched. more important, though, is not the amount of protein produced, but the fact that the plant-produced h <dig> protein exhibited the correct conformation as shown by the success of ha and hi tests in comparisons with known standards.

the murine trial demonstrated the ability of plant-produced h <dig> and h5tr to induce ha-specific antibodies, which was verified by western blot. the candidate h <dig> and h5tr vaccines therefore elicited the correct antibody response in vivo. however the hi titres were relatively low for all the sera. results for the sera of mice vaccinated with h <dig> showed that only three had hi titres above 1: <dig> the minimum hi titre considered to be protective in humans is ≥ 1: <dig>  <cit>  which indicates that the plant-produced h <dig> in this study would have elicited a protective immunity. the hi titres for mice vaccinated with h5tr were inconclusive. one of the reasons that the full length h <dig> did not elicit high hi titres might be due to the extraction method employed. the addition of triton-x <dig> to the extraction buffer possibly also destroyed any vlps that were formed.

western blot analysis of h5-immunised chicken sera clearly demonstrated the presence of ha-specific antibodies. ha-specific antibodies were also present in the sera from h5tr-immunised chickens, but to a lesser degree. in general, the antibody concentration was too low to inhibit haemagglutination of red blood cells during hi testing, with the exception of two serum samples from the h5tr-immmunised chickens . even though the hi titres were lower than 1: <dig> in both mice and chickens immunised with h5tr, it still indicated that our candidate h5tr vaccine warrants further investigation.

hi titres were relatively low for all chicken and mice sera: immune responses to our vaccine candidates may have been suboptimal because of dose and adjuvant choice . other studies that have tested plant-produced ha subunit vaccine candidates in animals have used various influenza strains, regions of ha, purification protocols, dosages, adjuvants and test animals - all which may play a role in vaccine efficacy. in mice, shoji et al.  <cit>  tested three doses ranging from  <dig> μg to  <dig> μg together with  <dig> μg of quil a adjuvant. d'aoust  <cit>  administered two doses of  <dig>  μg h5-vlps and spitsin et al. <cit>  used two doses of  <dig> μg with alum-cpg adjuvant. when considering immunisation studies conducted on ferrets, the doses varied from a  <dig> μg with alum adjuvant  <cit>  to  <dig> and  <dig> μg ha in quil a adjuvant  <cit> . ferrets, which are the preferred animal model for influenza  <cit> , were not available for our study; we decided to conduct our vaccine trial on chickens since these can be naturally infected by h5n <dig>  we deduced that our vaccine regimen  may have been too low to induce high antibody titres in chickens. a dose-ranging study will be necessary to determine the optimum antigen and adjuvant dosage. as mentioned above, the full-length h <dig> antigen may not have elicited high hi titres due to the presence of triton-x <dig> in the extraction buffer, which may have destroyed any vlps that were formed. d’aoust  <cit>  showed that low doses of  <dig>  μg vlps protect against lethal challenge in mice and that h <dig> antigen which did not form vlps induced up to six fold lower hi responses. it would be interesting to determine if vlps were formed in our study and to develop extraction methods for them.

based on our current results, it is not clear whether the plant-produced h <dig> or the h5tr showed the best potential as a candidate subunit vaccine. overall, a higher concentration of h5-specific antibodies was detected in chicken than in mouse sera; however, only two of the h5tr chicken serum samples and three of the h <dig> mouse serum samples gave low positive hi results.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings indicate it is possible to produce influenza subunit vaccines via plants in south africa. the yields of h <dig> and h5tr varied with experiment and by transgenic plant line, but in general were higher than those obtained by others: this may be due to the vector system used, as well as to the human codon optimisation of the genes. this is novel for ha genes in plants, and is based on our previous observation of a significant yield improvement for hpv l <dig> proteins  <cit> . these yields should make it economical to produce the h <dig> vaccine, even given the fact that higher doses of novel influenza vaccines will probably be needed in comparison to the seasonal vaccines  <cit> . we still need to give more attention to downstream processing and especially purification techniques, as large-scale end-stage production facilities do not exist in south africa. the study remains ongoing, as we are still monitoring our stable transgenic plants to determine whether gene integration remains stable over the next few generations: this will determine whether or not we will be able to establish a stable seedbank for emergency large-scale vaccine production.
