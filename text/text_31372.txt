BACKGROUND
dna methylation of the eukaryotic genome is essential for normal cellular differentiation and embryonic development  <cit> . methylation within gene promoter regions is important in the regulation of gene expression  <cit> , and changes in both overall methylation and specific methylation patterns have been shown to vary within an individual according to tissue type and disease status  <cit> . in healthy people, inter-individual differences in methylation are also observed and it has been postulated that these differences may be influenced by various factors, including sex .

studies that have investigated methylation differences between males and females in repeat sequences  and other targeted genomic areas have reported sex-specific methylation differences at various autosomal sites and suggested a tendency toward higher methylation levels in males than in females , although one study reported no significant difference  <cit> .

advances in microarray technology have enabled the assessment of genome-wide methylation by surveying cpg methylation at thousands of sites across the genome. the illumina infinium series is a commonly used commercial platform and the humanmethylation27k was one of the first comprehensive methylation microarrays. it interrogates over  <dig>  cpg sites in the promoter regions of more than  <dig>  refseq genes. studies using this array have reported that a large number of autosomal cpg sites  appear to be differentially methylated in females and males, and that global cpg methylation is higher in males than in females .

recent work has demonstrated substantial sequence overlap between autosomal and sex-linked probes on the humanmethylation27k microarray and that up to 10% of the probes are nonspecific and map to highly homologous genomic sequences  <cit> . the majority of the sex-associated methylation sites at autosomal cpg loci reported to date are likely to be technical artefacts created by the presence of cross-reactive autosomal probes hybridizing to both autosomal and sex chromosomes  <cit> .

we report new cpg associations with sex that are not due to nonspecific probes on the array. many of the cpg associations lie in genes thought to be involved in spermatogenesis and male fertility, such as slc9a <dig>  spesp <dig>  crisp <dig>  and nupl <dig>  pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of genes differentially methylated between males and females in several gene ontology  biological processes, such as regulation of immune response, rna splicing and dna repair. our findings support previously reported global methylation differences between females and males: increased autosomal methylation in males and increased x chromosome methylation in females.

RESULTS
x chromosome analysis and sex assignment
following quality control , the final dataset included data on  <dig>  samples from  <dig> studies from the european bioinformatics institute  database. of these,  <dig>  samples had sex recorded from the ebi phenotype files. the characteristics of this final dataset are displayed in table  <dig> table  <dig>

we initially sought to investigate whether sex could be inferred from x chromosome methylation data using principal component analysis . the first two principal components  were plotted against each other for all samples of known sex ). colouring by the recorded sex from the ebi phenotype files indicates that sex can be determined by classifying samples based on their first pc, with samples recorded as ‘other/trisomy’  clustering in the middle. the second pc, in contrast, contributes little to the separation of males and females. figure  <dig> shows that the samples of unknown sex cluster well with those of known sex. logistic regression of recorded sex on pc <dig> and recorded sex on pc <dig> showed that both relationships were significant and, as expected, pc <dig> was a much better predictor than pc <dig> .figure  <dig>

and other   and with those of unknown sex  superimposed .




due to x-inactivation as a result of lyonisation  <cit> , global methylation values across the  <dig> x chromosome sites contained on the humanmethylation27k beadchip were expected to be higher in females than in males and could therefore represent a robust means to distinguish between the sexes. a global x chromosome methylation value was calculated for each individual by summing the individual beta values at each of the  <dig> x chromosome cpg sites. global x chromosome methylation across the whole cohort  was approximately normally distributed . for those of known sex , global x chromosome methylation was significantly higher in females  compared to males .

sex was also inferred by global x chromosome methylation values using the midpoint between the mean global x chromosome methylation values for males and females . of the  <dig>  recorded sexes , using global x chromosome methylation to identify males gave a sensitivity  of  <dig> %  and a specificity  of  <dig> %  with an overall percentage of  <dig> % samples where sex was correctly identified. by comparison, using pc <dig> to identify males gave a sensitivity  of  <dig> %  and a specificity  of  <dig> %  with an overall percentage of  <dig> % samples in which sex was correctly identified. given that pc <dig> was a more sensitive and specific method than using global x chromosome methylation, we used pc <dig> to re-classify all sexes in the sample , resulting in a population of  <dig>  females and  <dig>  males.

inspecting all samples  after sex re-classification revealed some outliers, which were removed , leaving a final population of n =  <dig> , with n =  <dig>  samples of recorded sex. of these  <dig> ,  <dig> % were consistent with sex as classified using pc <dig> .

for this final sample of n =  <dig> , density plots of global x chromosome methylation by sex revealed distinct peaks using sex as assigned by pc <dig> . global x chromosome methylation was significantly higher in females  compared to males  using sex as assigned by pc <dig> a receiver-operating characteristic  curve comparing the predictive ability of three metrics generated from the x chromosome methylation data  showed that pc <dig> was the best predictor of sex . the area under the curve  was  <dig>  for pc <dig> versus  <dig>  for global x chromosome methylation, and only  <dig>  for pc <dig> figure  <dig>

differences in autosomal methylation between sexes
following quality control,  <dig>  cpg sites on the humanmethylation27k chip remained for analysis in  <dig>  individuals who were successfully classified by sex  and ). of these,  <dig>  cpg sites were located on the autosomes ). a density plot of individual methylation beta values for each of the  <dig>  autosomal cpg sites for all  <dig>  individuals ) showed that across all studies and for both sexes, the majority  of cpg sites had methylation values < <dig> , whilst  <dig> % of cpg sites had beta values > <dig> , the range at which probes would be considered to be fully methylated  <cit> . these percentages were not substantially different by sex .figure  <dig>

global methylation across the  <dig> autosomes was calculated for each sample by summing the individual cpg beta values across the  <dig>  autosomal cpg sites. global autosomal methylation was approximately normally distributed  but there were a number of female outliers  and additional file 1: figure s4), which skewed the mean female global autosomal methylation value . median global autosomal methylation in males was slightly, yet statistically significantly higher than in women , wilcoxon rank sum p = <dig> e-05).

global methylation across autosomal cpg sites varied greatly between studies . given that this variability could be due to underlying batch or cohort effects, a random effects meta-analysis was conducted for studies that included ≥ <dig> individuals, and in which both sexes were represented in at least a 1: <dig> ratio . a total of  <dig> studies  met these criteria, of which  <dig> included cancer samples. the difference in global autosomal methylation according to sex in each of these studies is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  meta-analysis revealed that global autosomal methylation was indeed very heterogeneous across studies, with the proportion of global autosomal variation in study estimates that is due to heterogeneity  = <dig> % . however, a funnel plot of the  <dig> studies did not indicate any major outliers  and the  <dig> cancer studies clustered well with the  <dig> non-cancer studies. despite the high heterogeneity, application of a random effects model suggested that global autosomal methylation was nominally higher in males than in females .

pca of individual beta values at autosomal cpg sites by sex was also highly confounded by batch effect, even after adjustment for study . hence, to identify individual cpg sites differentially methylated between males and females, we conducted a random effects meta-analysis using the  <dig> studies  in which both sexes were represented. estimated overall effects  and corresponding p values were calculated. overall,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  cpg sites were associated with sex after bonferroni correction .figure  <dig>

autosomal gene-specific methylation
all previously identified non-specific or polymorphic cpg probes  on the humanmethylation27k array were cross-referenced against the  <dig>  autosomal cpgs in the meta-analysis. in total,  <dig>  of the  <dig>  autosomal cpgs were non-specific and  <dig> were polymorphic. of the  <dig> cpg sites associated with sex after bonferroni correction in this study,  <dig> probes are non-specific and of the remaining  <dig> probes,  <dig> were polymorphic. these probes are indicated in the full results table .

meta-analysis of the cohort excluding cancer samples  was performed to ensure results were not due to confounding by cancer samples. there was good correlation between the p values from both meta-analyses, with linear regression r2 =  <dig> , p <  <dig> e- <dig> . in addition, the majority  of the cpg sites that passed bonferroni correction  in the meta-analysis of all samples passed the same threshold in the meta-analysis excluding cancer samples. the remaining  <dig> had p values between  <dig> e- <dig> and  <dig> e- <dig> in the meta-analysis excluding cancer samples .

mean differences in beta values between females and males were small. the mean beta difference between sexes for the  <dig> statistically significant probes was  <dig>  , with the vast majority of associated cpg sites  more methylated in females than in males.

pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment of genes with sex-associated changes in cpg methylation in  <dig> go biological pathways at p <  <dig>  . all biological processes enriched at p <  <dig>   are shown in table  <dig> and largely comprise cellular ‘housekeeping’ functions. gene overlap between pathways was relatively low, with  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes in the top four processes  unique to only one of these pathways . these top four processes were relatively distinct from the individually most strongly sex-associated cpg sites, with only  <dig> genes from these processes represented in the cpg sites which passed bonferroni correction. the median –log <dig> p values of the cpg sites of the genes in the top four biological processes compared to p values across all cpg sites are displayed in figure  <dig> table  <dig>

discussion
in this study we conducted a meta-analysis of publicly available, genome-wide methylation datasets to examine the possible relationship between methylation profiles and sex. following rigorous quality control, we analysed the data for differential methylation patterns in terms of global x chromosome methylation, global autosomal methylation, and differences between the methylation status at individual autosomal cpg probes according to sex.

x chromosome analysis
the x chromosome analysis demonstrated that, as expected, global x chromosome methylation is considerably higher in females compared to males. we also demonstrated that it is possible to accurately infer sex, based on pca of x chromosome methylation data, and that this method is superior to using global x chromosome methylation. in light of the increasing evidence for the importance of correction for sex in analysis of disease-specific methylation patterns, this provides a valuable technique for studies where sex information is not easily accessible.

autosomal methylation analysis
this analysis showed a small but significant increase in global autosomal methylation associated with male sex, concurring with previous studies  <cit> . many mechanisms may account for this global difference, but have so far remained elusive. a recent study indicated that this global difference in autosomal methylation does not appear to be driven by sex hormones  <cit> .

the findings of the analysis of methylation at individual cpg sites in this study have a number of features in common with the findings of chen et al.  <cit> . after excluding probes which were found to be non-specific, chen et al.  <cit>  also found only small absolute differences between male and female samples in the cpg probes that they found to be significantly differentially methylated by sex . similar to this study, the majority  of the cpg sites that they found to be associated with sex were more methylated in females. chen and colleagues reported associations between three  of our top  <dig> cpg sites and similar differences in beta values between sexes  <cit> .

as predicted, the majority of the genes that liu et al.  <cit>  found to be differentially methylated according to sex were on the x chromosome. these investigators reported  <dig> genes with very small cpg differences in autosomes: lrrc <dig> tdgf <dig>  rab9p <dig>  c6orf <dig>  tle <dig>  glud <dig>  alx <dig>  dppa <dig>  nupl <dig>  flj <dig> and flj <dig>  all of these genes were found to be significant in our analysis , with most being among our top  <dig> loci. apart from the nupl <dig> cpg probe, however, all of these cpg sites were found to be non-specific by chen et al.  <cit> .

autosomal sex-specific dna methylation has been demonstrated in several candidate gene studies  <cit> . although some of these genes  are also interrogated to some extent by the humanmethylation27k array, we observed significant sex-specific dna methylation only with mgmt , with all mgmt probes being more methylated in females. these findings are in contrast to previous reports in which higher methylation was shown in males  <cit> .

genes containing cpg islands with methylation differences of >5% between the sexes are listed in table  <dig>  many of these top cpg associations are in genes that may play a role in sex-specific functions. the top-hit from our meta-analysis, slc9a <dig>  encodes solute carrier family  <dig>  other solute carrier family proteins have been shown to be associated with male infertility  <cit> , suggesting a possible sex-specific role for this class of proteins. ddx <dig> has been shown to be differentially expressed in normal testis compared to testis of patients diagnosed with sertolicell-only  syndrome, and may play a role in spermatogenesis  <cit> . nupl <dig> has been shown to be highly expressed in the testes of fertile men compared to that of infertile men, suggesting its function is important for male fertility  <cit> . these genes may be associated with male infertility secondary to epigenetic deregulation. the results of the pathway analysis, on the other hand, suggest that the influence of sex on methylation is broad. we report enriched biological processes across a wide range of cellular functions, some of which, including dna transcription and rna splicing, were also reported by liu et al.  <cit> .table  <dig>

direction of effect  is for male relative to female methylation beta value, so that negative values indicate lower methylation in males. the number of the  <dig> studies in the meta-analysis which had individual associations consistent with the direction of effect in the meta analysis are also shown. all listed probes are located within a cpg island.



since the completion of this study, an increasing amount of data from the humanmethylation450k microarray are becoming publicly available, along with tools for their analyses  <cit> . the 450k array offers higher-resolution methylation data than the 27k, and it will be interesting see what this new set of data will reveal about sex-specific methylation patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
with the inclusion and careful analysis of all publicly available datasets, this study represents the most comprehensive analysis of sex-specific methylation patterns to date. this is likely the reason that, unlike previous studies, which reported few detectable dna methylation differences in autosomal genes between sexes  <cit> , we identified a modest number of cpg sites associated with sex after bonferroni correction. similar to other studies using microarray platforms, however, the mean beta differences associated with sex are very small   <cit> . this is far below the smallest difference  that microarray platforms reliably estimate  <cit> . the reason for this is not clear; it may be that sex-associated methylation differences are highly dynamic, leading to heterogeneous samples. nonetheless, the results reported here reliably demonstrate the existence of sex-specific methylation profiles, which is important not only in a biological context, but in recognising and dealing with potential confounding when undertaking methylation-disease association studies.
