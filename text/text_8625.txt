BACKGROUND
the lycophytes  are an ancient group of vascular plants that dominated the earth's flora during the carboniferous period. the three orders of lycophytes that remain from this period include the homosporous lycopodiales, the heterosporous selaginellales and the heterosporous isoetales. all of these plants are distinguishable from ferns and flowering plants by the presence of microphylls , the absence of leaf gaps and the absence of lateral roots. in common with ferns but not flowering plants, all lycophytes produce free-living spores, an independent gametophyte generation and non-integumented sporangia. based upon the fossil record, the lycophytes are thought to have emerged during the early devonian about  <dig> myr ago prior to the evolution of leaves and roots in vascular plants  <cit> . based on recent dna-based phylogenetic analyses, the lycopsida clade is monophyletic and sister to the fern/seed plant, or euphyllophyte, clade  <cit> . as representatives of the earliest and still-surviving vascular plant lineage, the lycophytes are an important group of plants for providing insights into the early evolution of land plants.

while genomic resources are available for many species of flowering plants, including the sequences of the arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , rice  <cit>  and poplar  <cit>  genomes, very few resources exist for plants other than angiosperms. a draft genome sequence is available for chlamydomonas reinhardtii  <cit> , a chlorophytic green alga that is a distant relative of the charophytic algal group that gave rise to land plants  <cit> . the huge phylogenetic gap between the characterized genomes of chlamydomonas reinhardtii and flowering plants greatly limits our ability to study how important features in plants originated and diversified at a genetic level. to help fill this gap, the genome sizes of several species of lycophytes were determined by cell flow cytometry in order to identify a lycophyte with a relatively small genome. of those surveyed, the spikemoss selaginella moellendorffii was found to have the smallest, with a nuclear genome size less than  <dig> mbp. here we describe the construction and characterization of a large insert bac library for this species.

RESULTS
genome size estimates
the approximate genome sizes of several lycophyte species were determined by cell flow cytometry using as an internal standard the nuclei of other plants or cells with genomes of known sizes . the homosporous huperzia lucidula and diphaiastrum digita  have the largest genomes of those surveyed, estimated to be  <dig> and  <dig> mbp/1c, respectively. isoetes engelmanii , a heterosporous lycophyte, has a genome size of  <dig> mbp/1c. the heterosporous selaginella moellendorffii  has the smallest genome of those surveyed, between  <dig> and  <dig> mbp/1c. the three estimates of s. moellendorffii genome size  vary depending on species used as the internal standard. we also confirmed that the genome size of s. moellendorffii is smaller than that of s. kraussiana , which was previously reported to have a genome size ranging from  <dig> – <dig>  pg/2c, or 157– <dig> mbp/1c  <cit> . the decision to construct a bac library from the heterosporous s. moellendorffii was largely based on its having the smallest genome size of all lycophyte accessions examined here or reported previously.

bac library construction and characterization
in constructing the bac library, nuclear dna was isolated from the growing tips of s. mollendorffii sporophytes, partially digested with hind iii and the library constructed and processed essentially according to luo and wing  <cit>  as described in the methods section. a total of  <dig> bac clones were picked, arrayed and processed for long-term storage. to estimate the insert sizes of this library, bac dnas were prepared from  <dig> randomly selected clones, digested with not i and size-separated by pulse field gel electrophoresis. the not i restriction patterns of  <dig> randomly selected clones are illustrated in figure  <dig>  of the  <dig> bac dnas prepared,  <dig> yielded no dna and  <dig> lacked an insert. of the remaining  <dig> clones with inserts, the inserts ranged in size from  <dig> to  <dig> kb, with 75% having inserts sizes 90– <dig> kb and 84% with inserts greater than  <dig> kb. the average insert size of the clones with inserts was  <dig> +/-  <dig> kb . the distribution of insert sizes is shown in figure  <dig> 

to estimate the extent of chloroplast and mitochondrial dna contamination of the bac library, the arrayed library was probed with two s. moellendorffi dna fragments that contain either chloroplast- or mitochondrial-encoded genes . the s. moellendorffii dna fragment containing the chloroplast encoded ribosomal proteins s <dig>  l <dig> and s <dig> hybridized to  <dig> bac clones. the s. moellendorffii dna fragment containing the mitochondria-encoded nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> gene did not hybridize to any bac clones but did hybridize to itself . it is unlikely that either fragment is of nuclear origin given that these genes are encoded by organelles in every plant species studied so far. the results of these hybridizations demonstrate that a very small proportion  of the bac inserts are of chloroplast origin. this is within the expected range for organellar dna contamination in large insert dna libraries  <cit> . the inability to detect clones that hybridize to mitochondrial dna might reflect a mitochondrial genome that is small enough to be efficiently removed from the nuclear dna preparation. however, the sizes of mitochondrial genomes in the lycophytes have yet to be reported.

to determine the number of genome equivalents represented by the bac library, the arrayed library was probed with the seven s. moellendorffii genes listed in table  <dig>  all seven genes potentially encode proteins that are at least 43% identical in amino acid sequence to similar genes in angiosperms. the two genes homologous to gibberellin insensitive  and cytochrome p <dig>  <dig>  were obtained by rt-pcr. the gene homologous to oxyanion translocation protein  was identified from an est library , while the genes homologous to the shortroot , magnesium chelatase subunit h , zinc-finger  and syntaxin  gene fragments used as probes were identified from the sequences generated from the ends a sheared s. moellendorffii genomic library . based upon the genomic dna hybridization results shown in figure  <dig>  these genes are present in either one or two copies in the genome. the number of bac clones that hybridized to the single-copy genes ranged from 7– <dig>  and to about twice that number of clones  using the two duplicated genes as probes . based on the results of these experiments, the estimated number of genome equivalents represented by the bac library is ~ <dig>  assuming that one nuclear genome equivalent is represented by  <dig> bac clones with nuclear dna inserts and each bac insert is  <dig> kb, we estimate that the s. moellendorffii genome is  <dig> mbp. this estimate coincides well with the estimated size of the nuclear genome of s. moellendorffii based upon cell flow cytometry.

to our knowledge, this is the first lycopsida bac library constructed. a bac library was recently published for physcomitrella patens  <cit> , a moss that has become a popular model system for functional genomics, biochemistry, evolutionary and developmental genetic studies . as a representative of the early branching vascular plants, the s. moellendorffii library described here will link genomic resources from algae  and moss  to seed plants, including important crop species. the library also will be a useful resource for readily identifying genes that are involved in developmental, physiological and biochemical processes in the lycophytes and provide an important tool for the study of plant evolution. the nuclear genome of s. moellendorffi is currently being sequenced by the department of energy joint genome institute using a shotgun sequencing approach  <cit> . the bac library described here is currently available to the scientific community through the arizona genomics institute  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have shown that the lycophyte s. moellendorffii has a very small genome size, as small or smaller than that of arabidopsis thaliana based on cell flow cytometry, and have constructed from this species a large insert bac library that contains about  <dig> genome equivalents and has an average insert size of  <dig> kb.
