BACKGROUND
progression through the cell cycle is accompanied by dramatic changes in cellular content and behavior, and involves a large number of proteins and processes. these changes are orchestrated by a small number of master regulators, including the cyclin-dependent kinases  and the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome . each cdk or apc/c isoform has a large number of substrates, and the substrates of each isoform are modified in a specific order that leads to sequential substrate activation or inactivation. this ordering of substrate modification allows a small number of master regulators to carry out their functions over a large time window with high temporal resolution, enabling precise and robust control of the numerous processes underlying cell cycle progression  <cit> .

the apc/c is an e <dig> ubiquitin ligase that drives mitotic progression by promoting timely degradation of key regulatory proteins  <cit> . in early mitosis, the apc/c associates with its activator subunit cdc <dig> and promotes degradation of the s cyclin, cyclin a  or clb <dig> , followed by securin several minutes later . securin degradation then unleashes separase to promote sister-chromatid separation. apc/ccdc <dig> also initiates the degradation of m cyclin, cyclin b  or clb <dig> , around the same time as securin  <cit> . the activator cdc <dig> is then replaced by a second activator, cdh <dig>  and apc/ccdh <dig> promotes complete degradation of m cyclin, followed by polo-like kinase  <dig>  aurora a, and other substrates, to complete mitosis and cytokinesis and drive progression into g <dig>  <cit> .

the apc/c, as a multi-subunit ring-domain e <dig> ubiquitin ligase, acts as a platform that brings together a substrate and an e <dig> charged with ubiquitin, thereby catalyzing ubiquitin transfer from the e <dig> to the substrate   <cit> . specific substrates generally bind with sufficient affinity that they remain bound during multiple ubiquitin transfer reactions, resulting in processive substrate modification  <cit> . ubiquitins can be added to multiple lysine residues on the substrate, or can be added to pre-attached ubiquitins to build a polyubiquitin chain. these chains are recognized by the proteasome, leading to substrate degradation  <cit> .

the activator cdc <dig> or cdh <dig> recruits substrate to the apc/c by interacting with short linear sequence motifs or degrons, such as the d box and ken box  <cit> . in addition to recruiting substrates, the activator subunit induces a conformational change in the apc/c core, thereby enhancing e <dig> binding and the rate of ubiquitin transfer  <cit> . interestingly, the d box and ken box of substrates contribute to this activation process. when substrates are directly fused to the apc/c core, thus bypassing the need of the d box and the ken box for the recruitment of substrates to the apc/c, the presence of these degron motifs still increases the ability of the activator to promote ubiquitin transfer  <cit> . thus, substrate degrons could potentially influence both the affinity for the apc/c and the catalytic rate of ubiquitin transfer.

apc/ccdc <dig> activation depends on the expression of cdc <dig> and phosphorylation of core apc/c subunits  <cit> . complete apc/ccdc <dig> activation also requires inactivation of the spindle assembly checkpoint , which monitors proper attachment of sister chromatids to the spindle  <cit> . in mammalian cells, cyclin a is degraded when the sac is on, while securin degradation begins when the sac is turned off, resulting in their sequential degradation  <cit> . in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, we recently showed that the sac is turned off earlier than securin degradation, and the different timing of clb <dig> and securin degradation is due to several other mechanisms   <cit> . in addition to its canonical d box, yeast clb <dig> has an abba motif that mediates an extra interaction with cdc <dig>  clb <dig> also interacts with cdk <dig> in a complex with the phosphate-binding accessory subunit, cks <dig>  cdk1-cks <dig> binds directly to phosphorylated apc/c core subunits  <cit>  and can thus bridge clb <dig> to apc/c. these mechanisms make clb <dig> an excellent apc/ccdc <dig> substrate, and clb <dig> is the first substrate to be degraded when apc/ccdc <dig> becomes active  <cit> . similar mechanisms promote cyclin a degradation in the presence of an active sac in mammalian cells . yeast securin degradation, on the other hand, is delayed by cdk <dig> phosphorylation near its d box and ken box, and lags behind clb <dig>  when all these differences are eliminated, the degradation of clb <dig> and securin occurs around the same time  <cit> .

in our previous single-cell studies, differences in the degradation timing of different substrates  were accompanied by relatively minor differences in their rates of degradation. for example, clb <dig> is degraded six minutes earlier than securin, while the difference in their apparent half-life is less than  <dig>  min   <cit> . thus, the overall timing of substrate degradation may be determined primarily by the timing of degradation onset. if true, this leads to an interesting question: if the mechanisms mentioned above make one substrate better than another, how do these mechanisms change the timing of degradation onset while having a relatively small effect on the rate of degradation? in other words, why don’t later substrates begin to be degraded as soon as apc/ccdc <dig> becomes active?

in the current work, we show that differences in degradation onset indeed account for a major part of the overall differences in degradation timing for clb <dig> and securin, and we explore how this differential onset is achieved. we first show that the abba motif of clb <dig> increases the catalytic rate of ubiquitin transfer when clb <dig> is bound to apc/ccdc <dig>  confirming that different substrates can be modified at different rates. we then build computational models that capture the interaction between the substrate and apc/ccdc <dig>  and we use these models to test the effects of substrate-specific changes in binding affinity and catalytic rate. in a one-substrate system lacking competition among different substrates, a multi-step ubiquitination process can produce a robust delay in substrate degradation relative to apc/ccdc <dig> activation, while maintaining a rapid degradation rate like that we observed in the cell. in a two-substrate system with a limited amount of apc/ccdc <dig>  competition can further influence the timing of degradation by limiting the amount of apc/c available for each substrate. the degradation timing of substrates is thus determined collectively by substrate-apc/ccdc <dig> interactions and apc/ccdc <dig> partitioning among substrates, both of which are influenced by differences in kinetic parameters among substrates. we then show experimentally that increasing the amount of clb <dig> does not significantly delay the degradation of securin, arguing that competition with clb <dig> is not a major determinant of securin degradation timing in the cell. finally, we use a modified one-substrate model to show that processivity in substrate ubiquitination is related to but not entirely predictive of degradation timing.

RESULTS
substrates of apc/ccdc <dig> have different times of degradation onset
in our previous work, we established a single-cell assay to track the degradation dynamics of apc/ccdc <dig> substrates in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae. we tagged each substrate with green fluorescent protein  to follow its change in concentration over time. in the same strain, we also tagged the spindle-pole body  component spc <dig> with mcherry. the spb is seen as one dot in g <dig> and s phase, and separates into two dots at the onset of mitosis. at the metaphase-anaphase transition, the spindle begins to elongate and the two spb dots move quickly away from each other. these two spb events serve as single-cell timing references that allow us to align and compare gfp-tagged substrate degradation dynamics in different cells, either from the same strain or with different gfp-tagged substrates  <cit> .

previously, we estimated degradation timing by using the time point when 50 % of the gfp-tagged substrate was degraded. here, we re-processed our previously published data to determine the timing of degradation onset. for each single-cell gfp trace, we smoothed and normalized the curve and calculated its first derivative . the minimum of the smoothed first derivative curve corresponds to the fastest declining point on the gfp trace during substrate degradation . working backwards in time from that point, we identified the latest time point at which the smoothed first derivative was close to zero, which we used as our estimate of the time of degradation onset .

for all the substrates we analyzed, differences in substrate degradation timing were accompanied by significant differences in the timing of degradation onset . most relevant for this work are three substrates: clb <dig>  securin-2a, and clb5-2a. the degradation onset of securin-2a, in which the inhibitory cdk phosphorylation sites are mutated , begins an average of four min after clb <dig> . we focused on securin-2a instead of securin because these cdk phosphorylation sites establish a positive feedback loop in securin degradation that could complicate our computational modeling  <cit> . clb5-2a, in which the abba motif is mutated , begins to be degraded three min later than wild-type clb <dig> . since the abba motif allows clb <dig> to compete with spindle assembly checkpoint  proteins for cdc <dig> binding  <cit> , it is possible that the delay in clb5-2a degradation relative to wild-type clb <dig> is due to weak remaining sac activity that does not inhibit clb <dig> degradation. however, when we disable the sac by deleting its key effector protein mad <dig>  clb5-2a degradation is delayed relative to clb <dig> to the same extent as it is in wild-type cells . therefore, we attribute the delay in clb5-2a degradation to a change in the clb5-2a-apc/ccdc <dig> interaction that is independent of the sac.

the onset of clb <dig> degradation indicates the time at which the sac is turned off and apc/ccdc <dig> first becomes active  <cit> . thus, other substrates, such as clb5-2a and securin-2a, are degraded several minutes after apc/ccdc <dig> becomes active. it is worth noting that in the strain where clb5-2a degradation was monitored, wild-type clb <dig> is deleted and there are no known apc/ccdc <dig> substrates that are better than clb5-2a . nevertheless, clb5-2a degradation is delayed even though the timing of apc/ccdc <dig> activation should remain the same.

clb <dig> abba motif increases the catalytic rate of clb <dig> ubiquitination
our next goal was to develop computational models to help us understand how differences among substrates translate into distinct times of degradation onset. first, we needed to assess the parameters that might vary among substrates. the abba motif of clb <dig>  interacts with cdc <dig>  and for cyclin a this interaction is known to increase the binding affinity for cdc <dig>  <cit> . we tested an additional possibility that is based on our previous evidence that the d box and ken box of securin increase the rate of ubiquitination once securin is bound to apc/ccdc <dig>  <cit> . we wondered whether the abba motif could also increase the catalytic rate of clb <dig> ubiquitination. we carried out apc/ccdc <dig> ubiquitination reactions in vitro to directly measure the catalytic rate of clb <dig> ubiquitination with or without the abba motif. we used a modified apc/c reaction in which the substrate is directly fused to the apc/c core subunit apc10/doc <dig>  <cit> . in this system, the enzyme is essentially saturated with substrate, and therefore differences in substrate affinity do not have an impact on the reaction rate. some ubiquitination occurs in the absence of activator subunit, but addition of activator  greatly enhances activity by improving the efficiency of the interaction with the e <dig>  <cit> . we fused the n-terminal  <dig> residues of clb <dig>  to apc <dig>  generated radiolabeled fusion protein by translation in vitro, and incubated the fusion protein with purified apc/ccdc <dig> lacking the apc <dig> subunit. as in our previous work  <cit> , we carried out activity measurements over a broad range of e <dig> concentrations. mutation of the abba motif caused a reproducible  <dig> - to 2-fold decrease in maximal catalytic activity . thus, apc/c substrates can differ not only in their binding affinities for the apc/c, but also in their catalytic rate of ubiquitin transfer.fig.  <dig> the abba motif of clb <dig> increases the catalytic rate of ubiquitin transfer. apc/ccdc <dig> activity was measured with a radiolabeled clb5-apc <dig> fusion protein  <cit>  containing the n-terminal  <dig> residues of clb <dig>  either wild-type or carrying the 2a mutations in the abba motif. reactions were performed in the presence of increasing concentrations of e <dig>  and reaction products were subjected to sds-page and autoradiography with a phosphorimager. the total amount of ubiquitinated substrate was quantified with imagequant software and plotted to determine maximal activity . results are representative of three independent experiments. apc/c anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome



a simple dynamic model for apc/ccdc20-mediated substrate ubiquitination and degradation
we developed a computational model to determine whether it is possible, in principle, to generate a robust delay in substrate degradation by simply relying on the interaction between one substrate and apc/ccdc <dig> . the model includes the following molecular species: free apc/ccdc <dig> ; free unmodified substrate , free substrate with one, two, three or four ubiquitins attached ; apc/ccdc20-bound unmodified substrate , and apc/ccdc20-bound substrate with one, two, three or four ubiquitins attached . these molecular species interact and interconvert by the following rate constants: apc/ccdc <dig> and free substrate associate with the rate constant ka; apc/ccdc20-bound substrates can either dissociate with rate constant kd or can be modified by the attachment of ubiquitin with the rate constant kc. once a substrate carries four ubiquitins, regardless of whether it is bound to apc/ccdc <dig> or not, it is degraded by the proteasome with rate constant e. the amount of active apc/ccdc <dig> increases linearly at rate pa starting from zero apc/ccdc <dig> at the zero time point. substrate starts at a fixed amount and we assume no production of substrate, since our previous work showed that the level of clb5-2a plateaus for several minutes before its degradation begins  <cit> . the concentration change of each molecular species was determined by ordinary differential equations , and all reactions were modeled as mass action since we considered binding and catalysis steps explicitly.fig.  <dig> a dynamic model for substrate degradation. a the components of the model. a: free apc/ccdc <dig>  s: free substrate, as: apc/ccdc20-substrate complex, k

the initial concentration of the free substrate was set at  <dig> nm, based on previous estimates of clb <dig> concentration in the cell  <cit> . we fixed the rate of apc/ccdc <dig> accumulation pa at  <dig>  nm/sec, based on estimates of cdc <dig> concentration obtained by single-cell analysis of gfp-tagged cdc <dig> . the degradation rate constant e was fixed at  <dig> /sec, ensuring that substrate was degraded as soon as it was modified with four ubiquitins. all other parameters were varied across a range of values. we varied the substrate ubiquitination and dissociation rate constants kc and kd from 10−3/sec to 103/sec, based in part on previous enzymatic reaction results in vitro  <cit> . substrate association rate constant ka varied from 10−4/ to 10/ . note that ka should be similar for different substrates as it is mostly determined by rates of random collisions, but we still analyzed a range of ka values to gain insights about the system.

we evaluated our model at  <dig> values for kc and kd and six values for ka, all evenly distributed on a log scale, so that each kc and kd value was changed by a factor of  <dig> , and ka changed by a factor of  <dig>  as compared to its immediate neighbors. for each set of parameters, we calculated the dynamics of substrate concentration over a period of 50 min, which is similar to the duration of a movie for experimental analysis .

delay in degradation onset and fast degradation rate are opposing constraints
using the one-substrate apc/ccdc <dig> model, we first searched for the parameter space that generated two behaviors seen in our previous in vivo studies: a significant delay in degradation onset and a rapid degradation rate. for each set of parameters, we quantified the delay in degradation onset by measuring the duration from time zero  to the time when substrate concentration declined to 95 % of its initial value . to estimate the rate of substrate degradation, we measured the duration from t <dig> to the time when 50 % of the substrate was degraded  . based on our experimental data, we were looking for the set of model parameters that had a t <dig> greater than 200 sec as well as a td of less than 600 sec. it was immediately clear that these two criteria are satisfied by opposing constraints. at any fixed substrate association rate constant ka, a long t <dig> requires a small ubiquitination rate constant kc and/or a large substrate dissociation rate constant kd, whereas a short td requires a large kc and/or a small kd . therefore, the parameter space where both criteria are satisfied is restricted to a small overlap zone. within this zone, we can easily reproduce clb5-2a or securin-2a degradation dynamics like those observed in vivo .fig.  <dig> a delay in degradation onset and a fast rate of degradation are opposing constraints. a measurement of t <dig> as an estimate of the delay in degradation onset, and td as an estimate of degradation rate. b the k

deubiquitination helps establish a delay at a cost to degradation rate
the ubiquitination state of a protein is determined by the relative rates of ubiquitination and deubiquitination. we thus analyzed the role of deubiquitination in our model by incorporating a deubiquitination reaction for all substrates with ubiquitins attached, bound to apc/ccdc <dig> or not. this led to an increase in the delay of degradation onset but also reduced the degradation rate, and was not essential to reproduce the experimentally observed delayed substrate degradation onset . we also tried allowing deubiquitination only for free substrates, only for apc/ccdc20-bound substrates, or only for substrates with one ubiquitin attached  <cit> , and obtained similar results .

varying the dissociation rate constant kd influences degradation timing when free apc/ccdc <dig> is available
to address how the timing of degradation might be changed for different substrates, we quantified the delay in degradation onset  for substrates with different kc and kd. we fixed ka at  <dig> / and calculated t <dig> for each combination of kc-kd . as expected, increasing kc  or decreasing kd  generally accelerated the ubiquitination process and decreased t <dig> fig.  <dig> varying k

to measure the change in t <dig> that results from a small change in kc, we calculated the relative decrease in t <dig> following an increase in kc by a factor of  <dig>  , starting with every kc-kd combination . increasing kc decreased t <dig> significantly throughout the parameter space, except in the region where degradation occurs extremely fast due to large kc.

similarly, we calculated the relative decrease in t <dig> after a decrease in kd by a factor of  <dig>  . decreasing kd caused a significant decrease in t <dig> primarily in the area where free apc/ccdc <dig> is available . in the lower left parameter region where varying kd does not significantly influence t <dig>  all apc/ccdc <dig> molecules are occupied by substrate, ubiquitination occurs at the maximum rate, and varying kd does not significantly change the amount of substrate-bound apc/ccdc <dig> 

a model system with two substrates sharing the same pool of apc/ccdc <dig> readily generates differences in degradation onset
since the amount of cdc <dig> is not in large excess over substrates in vivo , competition among substrates for apc/ccdc <dig> is possible. to understand how competition might influence substrate degradation timing, we analyzed a model with two substrates, c and s, that are based on the yeast substrates clb <dig> and securin-2a. the two substrates start at the same concentration and interact with the same pool of apc/ccdc <dig>  the only difference is that c is a better substrate than s, either by having:  a smaller dissociation rate constant kd,c that is 1/ <dig> the kd,s of s; or  a larger catalytic rate constant kc,c that is 10-fold greater than the kc,s of s.

we first analyzed the differences in degradation onset  between c and s in two-substrate systems. regardless of the way in which c is a better substrate, we found a large parameter region in which there was a robust, significant difference in the timing of their degradation onset . the region where the difference in t <dig> was small had either:  a small kd,s, such that the difference between kd,s and 1/ <dig> kd,c was too small to distinguish c and s and the two substrates were degraded with similar timing; or  a large kc, such that the degradation of both substrates was extremely fast .fig.  <dig> two-substrate system in which c has higher affinity than s for apc/ccdc <dig>  the parameter space shown is k

we then analyzed the differences in degradation rate  between c and s . c generally had a higher degradation rate than s , whether its affinity for apc/ccdc <dig> was higher  or its rate of catalysis was higher , which is consistent with our previous observation that the rate of clb <dig> degradation in vivo is slightly higher than that of securin-2a   <cit> . only one parameter region did not generate this result: when c had higher affinity for apc/ccdc <dig>  the degradation rate of c was slower than that of s at some low values of kd,s and kc,s .

substrate competition could delay degradation by decreasing available apc/ccdc20
we next explored in more detail how two different substrates influence each other’s degradation timing and rate, by comparing degradation of s in a two-substrate system to that in a one-substrate system with the same parameter values. we reasoned that in parameter regions where c has little effect on s degradation, the timing and rate of s degradation are determined primarily by its interaction with apc/ccdc <dig> as in a one-substrate system, and all the properties of a one-substrate system apply.

we first analyzed the two-substrate system in which c binds apc/ccdc <dig> with ten-fold higher affinity than s , as described above. we calculated the relative increase in the t <dig> of s following the addition of c to the system, compared to s being the only substrate. in one parameter region, the addition of c significantly delayed the degradation of s . under these conditions, c competitively inhibits s degradation by occupying a large amount of apc/ccdc <dig>  thereby reducing the amount of apc/ccdc <dig> available to s . in the other parameter regions, kd,s is sufficiently large to allow more free apc/ccdc <dig> in the one-substrate system , and the additional c in the system occupies only a small fraction of apc/ccdc <dig>  this helps buffer against the effect of adding c to the system, and c does not delay s degradation significantly .

interestingly, c did not have a significant impact on s in our alternate two-substrate system in which c is 10-fold more efficiently ubiquitinated once bound to apc/ccdc <dig>  addition of c to this system had very little effect on the degradation of s in the entire parameter region . in this scenario, when c is bound to apc/ccdc <dig>  the substrate either dissociates or is rapidly ubiquitinated and destroyed. this short life-time of the c-apc/ccdc <dig> complex results in a very small population of c-bound apc/ccdc <dig> . thus, c does not sequester apc/ccdc <dig> away from s and has little influence on s degradation, and the delayed degradation of s is primarily established by the parameters of its interaction with the apc/ccdc <dig> as in the one-substrate system. interestingly, in some parameter regions in this scenario, s is more efficient in occupying apc/ccdc <dig> and can delay degradation of c .

the two-substrate systems we analyzed are both extreme cases. in reality, clb <dig> could be better than securin-2a due to relatively small improvements in both kd and kc. for instance, our biochemical studies showed that the abba motif of clb <dig> can increase its kc , and others have shown that the abba motif of cyclin a can decrease its kd  <cit> . other apc/c-interacting motifs are also likely to have similar effects on both kd and kc  <cit> . these parameters influence both the substrate-apc/ccdc <dig> interaction and the effect of competition for limited amounts of apc/ccdc <dig>  for the clb5-2a mutant that lacks the abba motif, the delayed degradation onset compared to clb <dig> might be a combined result of being a less efficient apc/ccdc <dig> substrate and possibly less efficient in competing with other substrates for apc/ccdc <dig> binding.

similar conclusions are reached in models with constant apc/ccdc <dig> activity
in the modeling described thus far, we used linearly increasing apc/ccdc <dig> activity as a simple approximation of the condition in the cell. to explore further the effects of different patterns of apc/ccdc <dig> activation, we carried out computational studies of one- and two-substrate systems with a constant level of apc/ccdc <dig> , as might be the case when apc/ccdc <dig> activity increases abruptly  to maximal levels. the major effect of constant apc/ccdc <dig> activity is that the system has a smaller parameter region with both delayed degradation onset and rapid degradation rate . we explain this result as follows: larger amounts of apc/ccdc <dig> activity exist at earlier time points in this system than in the system with gradually increasing apc/ccdc <dig> activity, and this reduces the delay in degradation onset. at later time points, apc/ccdc <dig> is not increasing and this reduces the degradation rate. other than these changes, however, all other conclusions from our previous models remain unchanged: one substrate can still exhibit a robust delay in its degradation onset, and adding a second substrate may or may not increase this delay, depending on how apc/ccdc <dig> is partitioned among the substrates .fig.  <dig> alternative models with constant apc/ccdc <dig> as input. a one-substrate system. these plots show the same quantities calculated in figs. 3c and 4b, except using models in which apc/ccdc <dig> activity increases abruptly and remains constant. b two-substrate system. these plots show the same quantities calculated in fig. 5a,c and fig. 6a,c, except using models in which apc/ccdc <dig> activity increases abruptly and remains constant. apc/c anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome



clb <dig> does not significantly delay securin degradation
if competition from clb <dig> contributes significantly to the delay in securin-2a degradation, then the delay should be reduced by removing clb <dig> and increased by adding more clb <dig>  direct deletion of clb <dig> causes dna replication defects and slows cell-cycle progression, which would complicate our measurement of mitotic timing  <cit> . we therefore decided to add more clb <dig> to the cell by introducing an extra copy of clb <dig>  driven by its own promoter, into cells with securin replaced by the securin-2a allele. these cells maintain their endogenous copy of clb <dig>  the extra copy of clb <dig> was tagged with gfp to confirm its expression in the cell . the presence of the extra clb <dig> did not delay spindle elongation relative to spb separation . since spindle elongation is directly driven by securin-2a degradation, we conclude that the timing of securin-2a degradation was unaffected by extra clb <dig>  these results are most consistent with a two-substrate model in which clb <dig> has a higher kc, does not occupy a significant fraction of the apc/ccdc <dig>  and therefore does not compete effectively with securin in vivo .fig.  <dig> extra clb <dig> does not significantly delay securin-2a degradation in vivo. a a strain was constructed in which an extra copy of clb <dig>  tagged with gfp and under the control of its own promoter, was introduced into a securin-2a strain. the expression level of the extra copy of clb5-gfp is similar to that in a different strain in which endogenous clb <dig> was tagged with gfp. b time from spb separation  to spindle elongation  with one or two copies of clb <dig> in the cell. gfp green fluorescent protein



processivity is determined by a subset of the factors that determine degradation timing and dynamics
the apc/c is processive: more than one ubiquitin can be attached during a single substrate-binding event   <cit> . differences in processivity with different substrates are thought to influence the order of substrate degradation timing  <cit> . we explored this issue by analyzing the relationship between processivity and substrate degradation timing and dynamics with a modified one-substrate model. processivity is measured as the number of ubiquitins attached to a substrate before it dissociates from apc/ccdc <dig>  thus, a simple model to calculate processivity can start with s-bound apc/ccdc <dig>  as the sole molecular species and does not require an association rate constant, in which case the concentration of free substrate or apc/ccdc <dig> becomes unimportant . in the same kc-kd parameter space that we analyzed in our other studies, we calculated the average number of ubiquitins per substrate molecule after the system reached steady state for each parameter combination. as expected, processivity, as a steady state property, is determined by the relative strength of kc and kd . however, higher processivity did not always correlate with earlier or faster degradation . we believe this is the case because t <dig> and td, as dynamic properties, are determined not only by the absolute strength of kc and kd but also by additional factors, including the association rate constant ka and the concentrations of free s and apc/ccdc <dig>  thus, processivity is related to substrate degradation timing and dynamics but is not the sole determinant.fig.  <dig> the relationship between processivity and degradation timing or dynamics. a a modified one-substrate model to simulate processivity. the system starts with as <dig> as the only component. each as complex can either obtain one ubiquitin or dissociate into a and s. b graphs at left show the amounts of each species as the system approaches steady state over time. the plot on the right shows the average number of ubiquitins per substrate, calculated as follows: when all substrates have dissociated from apc/c, no more reactions occur and the system reaches steady state, the total number of ubiquitins attached to all substrates is divided by the total number of substrates. c t <dig> and td were calculated with the one-substrate system illustrated in fig.  <dig>  the t <dig> plot shows the same data as in fig. 4a, color-coded to provide more detail and to facilitate comparison with panel b above. apc/c anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome

a key feature of the apc/ccdc <dig> system is the multi-step ubiquitination process. a substrate that takes longer to acquire enough ubiquitins for efficient degradation, either due to lower affinity binding to apc/ccdc <dig> or a slower rate of ubiquitination once it is bound, will take longer to initiate degradation. if two substrates differ only in their catalytic rate of ubiquitin transfer, they will have different timing of degradation onset . if two substrates differ only in their binding affinity for apc/ccdc <dig>  then each substrate by itself  may not have dramatically different degradation onset timing. however, when the two substrates share the same pool of apc/ccdc <dig>  the substrate with tighter binding affinity might sequester apc/ccdc <dig> away from the other substrate to delay its degradation. as a result, regardless of whether substrates differ in their kc or kd, they are very likely to have different times of degradation onset. ordered substrate degradation is therefore likely to be the default output of the apc/c ubiquitination system.

it is important to emphasize that competition among substrates is not necessary for delayed substrate degradation relative to apc/ccdc <dig> activation. the impact of competition depends on how apc/ccdc <dig> is partitioned among its substrates, which is determined by the relative concentrations of apc/ccdc <dig> and all of its substrates, and the relative strengths of substrate-specific kinetic parameters. these parameters are not readily determined inside the cell, and so the effect of competition in vivo is difficult to predict. nevertheless, it is possible to gain some insight by testing the effects of small perturbations in substrate concentrations within a physiologically relevant range. we showed, for example, that an extra copy of clb <dig> has no effect on the timing of securin degradation, suggesting that competition from clb <dig> does not delay securin degradation. however, clb <dig> and securin are not the only substrates in the cell that compete for apc/ccdc <dig> binding. a complete understanding of competition in this system will require more extensive experiments that take all substrates into account.

previous work unveiled multiple mechanisms that influence substrate degradation timing, such as the abba motif and cdk1/cks <dig> binding of clb <dig>  as well as the phosphorylation of securin. however, it is not clear which parameters these mechanisms actually influence. an obvious and very likely possibility is that many of these mechanisms simply change the affinity of a substrate for apc/ccdc <dig>  which can have an impact on the timing of degradation. our experimental and modeling work also point to a less intuitive possibility: changes in substrate binding to apc/ccdc <dig> can affect catalytic rate. here, we showed that the abba motif increases kc for clb <dig> by nearly two-fold. similarly, in previous work, we showed that binding of the d box and ken box of substrates to the activator subunit helps promote catalytic function  <cit> . these results raise the interesting possibility that apc/ccdc <dig> substrate binding and catalytic stimulation are intrinsically coupled, such that degrons enhance both affinity and catalysis. one potential explanation is that binding of additional degron motifs to the activator reduces the flexibility of disordered substrate regions flanking the binding sites, thereby reducing unproductive substrate orientations and allowing more efficient ubiquitin transfer. in addition, substrate-activator binding might help orient the activator to enhance the efficiency of e <dig> binding, and different substrates might be more or less effective in doing this.

a more complete understanding of the system requires knowledge of real rate constants in vivo, which are not well characterized. catalytic rates measured in apc/c reactions in vitro are very low and seem unlikely to be reflective of real rates in vivo; for example, we recently observed that the catalytic rate constant of ubiquitin transfer with apc/ccdh <dig> is roughly  <dig> /sec with the e <dig> ubc <dig>  using a securin-apc <dig> fusion protein as substrate  <cit> ; this rate is likely to be lower than actual rates because it was measured with methylated ubiquitin. we are similarly uncertain about the affinity of substrates for the apc/c. the apparent km for sea urchin cyclin b with apc/ccdh <dig> is  <dig> nm  <cit> , and an equilibrium dissociation constant kd in the range of  <dig> nm to 1 μm is a reasonable estimate for a substrate with two short linear degrons. if we assume that apc/c-substrate association is simply diffusion-limited, then the association rate constant ka would be roughly  <dig>  ~  <dig> / ). if the kd is  <dig> nm to 1 μm, then we might predict a dissociation rate constant kd of  <dig>  ~ 1/sec.

all of these values fall within the parameter space we studied. however, it is inappropriate to directly map these estimates on our parameter space, as the models greatly simplify the real system in several respects. for example, we assumed linearly increasing or constant apc/ccdc <dig> levels, while apc/ccdc <dig> activation dynamics in vivo could be much more complex. in addition, we considered only single ubiquitin chain formation, we did not explicitly model activator and e <dig> binding to apc/ccdc <dig>  and we assumed the same rate constants for all steps. it is also important to note that our experiments measure the degradation of substrate, which is a combined result of ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. since the mutants we analyzed specifically perturb the substrate-apc/ccdc <dig> interaction, we focused on the ubiquitination process. it is possible, however, that substrate-specific differences in proteasomal degradation also contribute to the dynamics of substrate degradation.

by constructing simple models and scanning a broad range of reasonable parameters, our goal was not to reproduce precisely the behavior of substrates in the cell, but rather to obtain useful general insights into the key factors that determine the sequential modification of apc/c targets during progression through mitosis. our conclusions are far from comprehensive and definitive, but we hope that they will motivate and serve as a primer for future investigations. it is likely that similar principles will help us understand the sequential phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of protein kinase targets during the cell cycle. cdk <dig> substrates, for example, often have multiple phosphorylation sites, and ordered substrate phosphorylation is likely to depend on variations in docking motifs that confer differences in specificity   <cit> . similarly, the sequential dephosphorylation of yeast cdk <dig> substrates in late mitosis is thought to be a combinatorial result of cdk <dig> specificity and specificity of the phosphatase cdc <dig>  <cit> . our work also emphasizes the connection and distinction between the two dynamic properties that are critical in the control of cell division: timing and rate, which we find are determined by the same sets of parameters but favor opposing trends of parameter values. thus, for example, a deubiquitination reaction in our system facilitates the delay in degradation onset but also compromises the rate of degradation. these findings raise interesting questions about the strategies cells use to optimize both the timing and rate of cellular events, and how cellular circuits evolve under these constraints.

CONCLUSIONS
our goal in this work was to develop a quantitative framework to help us understand our experimental observations that:  different apc/ccdc <dig> substrates begin to be degraded at different times;  some substrates do not start to decline until the apc/ccdc <dig> has been active for several minutes;  once degradation begins, substrates are degraded within several minutes; and  earlier substrates degrade at a rate slightly faster than later substrates. a simple multi-step ubiquitination model is sufficient to recapitulate what we observe in vivo. our modeling shows that delayed degradation onset and fast degradation rates are opposing constraints in the system. our models also show that, at fixed substrate and apc/ccdc <dig> concentrations, substrate degradation dynamics can be determined by a combination of substrate-apc/ccdc <dig> interactions , and competition among substrates . varying parameters, such as kc and kd, influences both substrate-apc/ccdc <dig> interactions and the competition among substrates, and thus results in changes in the onset and rate of degradation.
