BACKGROUND
it has long been hypothesized that differences in gene expression contribute extensively to phenotypic differences among species
 <cit> . numerous studies have investigated the effects of cis-acting elements and trans-acting proteins on gene expression divergence
 <cit> . a recently discovered class of regulatory rna molecules called mirnas is known to play an important role in gene expression. it is now predicted that nearly 50% of mammalian mrnas are regulated at the translational level by mirnas
 <cit> . many mirnas exhibiting both broad sequence and expression conservation among animal species have been identified
 <cit> . however, recent high-throughput small rna sequencing and comparative genomic studies have led to the discovery of a large number of mirnas with limited species conservation
 <cit> . gene expression regulation by these mirnas, some of which may be species-specific, may be one of the important mechanisms behind some of the expression and phenotype divergence observed among species.

in this study, we aimed to investigate how species-specific mirnas drive gene expression divergence by identifying cattle-specific mirnas and characterizing their contribution to cattle-specific gene expression divergence using illumina sequencing and comparative genomics. dramatic physiological and phenotypic differences exist between ruminant and non-ruminant mammalian species. for example, volatile fatty acids produced as by-products of the microbial fermentation in the rumen are used as the major source of energy in ruminants as opposed to glucose absorbed from the small intestine in non-ruminants. because of this difference in nutrient usage, ruminants are less sensitive to insulin than non-ruminants
 <cit> . several major genes involved in the insulin pathway, including insr, glut <dig>  glut <dig> and pi3k, show decreased expression in ruminants compared to non-ruminants
 <cit> .

RESULTS
profiling of mirnas from the whole blood of cattle and pigs
to assess mirna repertoire divergence between a ruminant and a closely related non-ruminant species, we sequenced mirnas isolated from whole blood samples of cattle and pigs. from three blood samples of each species, an average of  <dig> million reads   were obtained, and approximately 89% of the reads could be mapped to the corresponding reference genome assemblies: umd <dig>  for cattle and sscrofa <dig>  for pigs. a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas have been reported for cattle and pigs respectively in mirbase release  <dig>  using the mirna discovery software, mirdeep2
 <cit> , we identified at total of  <dig> and  <dig> known  mirnas expressed in the blood of cattle and pig respectively . the mirdeep <dig> software can also predict novel mirnas using a probabilistic model of mirna biogenesis to score compatibility of the position and frequency of sequenced rna with the secondary structure of the mirna precursor. the de novo prediction strategy employed by mirdeep <dig> was able to identify 87% and 90% of the mirnas observed in cattle and pig respectively through mapping to known mirnas in mirbase. it was estimated that a mirdeep <dig> score cutoff of  <dig> corresponds to a true positive prediction percentage greater than 90%, and a signal-to-noise ratio >  <dig>  criteria that the authors of the software recommend
 <cit> . with these criteria, we predicted  <dig> and  <dig> novel mirnas in cattle and pig respectively . thus a substantially higher number of mirna species were identified in cattle blood compared to pig blood, and several of the mirnas identified in this work have not been previously described. the number of reads detected for each of the known mirnas is summarized in additional file
 <dig> and the sequences and genomic positions of novel mirnas are shown in additional file

expansion and diversification of cattle-specific mirnas
since a substantially higher number of expressed mirnas were identified in cattle relative to pigs, we wondered if cattle possess additional mirna genes not found in non-ruminant genomes. to investigate this possibility, we analyzed the conservation of cattle mirnas across  <dig> vertebrate species with good quality genome assemblies available in the ensembl database, version  <dig> . our analyses revealed an overall expansion of mirna repertoire in cattle. about 20%  of the known and over 76%  of the novel cattle mirnas did not have homologs in any of the  <dig> vertebrate species . we refer to these  <dig> mirnas as ‘cattle-specific’ . the mir- <dig> family with  <dig> members reported in mirbase  <dig> is the largest mirna family in cattle. based on our conservation analysis, this family is also cattle-specific.

after a new mirna gene has emerged, through duplication of an existing gene for example, it can be further diversified in different ways. a seed region of about  <dig> nucleotides in length at the 5' end of an animal mirna is thought to be an important determinant of target specificity
 <cit> . one of the mechanisms for acquiring divergent function is seed shifting, wherein the dominant mature mirna isoform is shifted by one to several nucleotides in the 5’ or 3’ direction relative to its original position
 <cit> . the mir- <dig> family with  <dig> members provides us with an opportunity to investigate how different mechanisms shaped its diversification. an alignment of the sequences of the members of this family reveals that they share only  <dig> seed sequences and that these seeds might have evolved by seed shifting and point mutation .

based on the numbers of reads obtained for each mirna, most of the  <dig> cattle-specific mirnas are expressed at a low level relative to the non-cattle-specific mirnas, at least in blood . of these  <dig>  we consider  <dig> mirnas with read count greater than  <dig>  as relatively highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas. these  <dig> mirnas included  <dig> members of the mir- <dig> family of which bta-mir-2284x had the highest expression.

target sites of cattle-specific mirnas show accelerated sequence evolution
to better understand how target sites have evolved with the emergence of cattle-specific mirnas, we first evaluated whether the cattle-specific mirnas have a greater proportion of targets that are also cattle-specific. we used the predicted target sites of known and novel mirnas from targetscan  and determined their positions on the 23-way utr alignments available in targetscan. indeed a significantly higher  proportion of target sites were found to be specific to cattle  for cattle-specific mirnas compared to that  for non-cattle-specific mirnas . next, we compared the distribution of normalized divergence rates  of target sites for cattle-specific versus non-cattle-specific mirnas. the distribution for cattle-specific mirnas displayed a shift towards the right indicating a significantly higher divergence rate  and thus more rapid sequence evolution for target sites of cattle-specific mirnas relative to those of non-cattle-specific mirnas . the same trends were obtained when the context + score cutoff for predicting mirna targets was relaxed  or made more stringent  indicating that the results were not dependent on the choice of context + score cutoffs. thus we demonstrate that the emergence of cattle-specific mirnas was accompanied by accelerated sequence evolution of their target sites.

the predicted targets information is available from targetscan for only the major mirna sequences  sequences) i.e.  <dig> of the  <dig> cattle-specific and  <dig> of the  <dig> non-cattle-specific mirnas.

decreased expression of the target genes of cattle-specific mirnas
although our analyses suggest that there have been substantial additions to the mirna and mirna target repertoire during the evolution of cattle relative to pigs and other mammals, an important question remaining in this study is whether cattle-specific mirnas contribute to gene expression divergence. to test this we measured mrna expression in the whole blood of seven cattle and three pigs using rna-seq. we used the distribution of expression ratios of all orthologous genes between cattle and pig as the genome-wide background . the target genes of  <dig> highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas were indeed expressed at lower levels in cattle relative to their pig orthologues, as indicated by a leftward shift in the cumulative distribution of the mrna expression ratio for the highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas relative to the genome-wide background  . next we tested whether cattle-specific mirnas tend to decrease target gene expression by binding to cattle-specific or conserved target sites. targets of cattle-specific mirnas with conserved target sites and those with cattle-specific target sites showed reduced expression in cattle relative to the genome-wide background  . the distributions for the target genes of cattle-specific mirnas with conserved target sites  were not significantly different  from those with cattle-specific target sites . we observe a similar pattern of expression divergence when using an expression data set from human blood 
 <cit>  as the one we generated from pigs .

we next looked at the magnitude of expression reduction of targets of highly expressed mirnas compared to genome-wide background. we only looked at the genes with fold change between pig and cattle greater than  <dig> . the targets of the highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas  showed significantly more reduction  than the genome-wide background  . thus the target genes of highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas showed 8% / <dig> ) greater expression reduction compared to the genome-wide background. dividing the targets of the highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas into those having cattle-specific or conserved target sites, we found that the degree of reduction in expression for both types  was significantly greater  than the genome-wide background . the reduction in expression of target genes with conserved target sites of the highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas was not significantly different from the target genes with cattle-specific targets .

functional enrichment of target genes of cattle-specific mirnas
in order to assess the biological effects of the  <dig> highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas, we looked for enriched biological pathways among the genes they target. we examined kegg pathway enrichment for targets expressed in blood  and for expressed targets with reduced expression in cattle compared to pigs  and human . because mirnas expressed in blood can target genes in other tissues
 <cit> , we also looked at all predicted targets  irrespective of their expression in blood. although most of the kegg pathways found to be enriched  did not show an obvious relationship to cattle-specific functions , the insulin signalling pathway, which is known to contribute to metabolic differences between ruminants and non-ruminants, is enriched in targets expressed in blood  and in expressed targets with reduced expression in cattle compared to human  but not pig . the insulin signalling pathway showed a p-value of  <dig>  when considering all predicted targets of the  <dig> highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas. notably, cattle-specific mirnas may target some of the key annotated insulin signalling pathway genes, including akt <dig>  cblb, foxo <dig> and pik3r <dig> .

discussion
in this study, 23% of the mirnas identified from cattle whole blood are found to have no homologs in  <dig> other vertebrate species examined. based on this set of cattle-specific mirnas, we can provide an estimate of the net gain rate of new mirnas during cattle evolution. given the estimated  <dig>  myr  divergence time between cattle and pig
 <cit>  and the  <dig> cattle-specific mirnas we identified, the net gain rate of mirnas expressed in blood is estimated as  <dig>  mirnas per myr. this is about twice the rate of that observed in pigs . one of the most interesting cases is the bta-mir- <dig> family, which has  <dig> members. why does the cattle genome maintain so many members in this family? the abundant mirna seeds generated by seed shifting and point mutation in this family indicate that the emergence of novel mirnas may have led to adaptive functional diversification. however, the number of unique seeds is much less than the number of paralogues and many mirna members share the same seed sequence, suggesting that dosage effect might be also important for the function of mir- <dig> family.

it has long been hypothesized that gene expression changes are one of the main underlying causes of phenotypic differences between species
 <cit> . while divergence in cis-acting elements and trans-acting proteins has been shown to underlie evolutionary divergence
 <cit> , relatively little is known about the role of mirnas in shaping gene expression divergence. here we showed that both the proportion of genes with decreased expression and the degree of expression reduction  are higher for targets of cattle-specific mirnas compared to genome-wide background. the target genes of cattle-specific mirnas might have been under selection for decreased expression, which has been achieved by several means, one of them being cattle-specific mirnas. however, the fact that the target genes of highly expressed cattle-specific mirnas show a greater reduction in expression than those of the cattle-specific mirnas expressed at low levels  further implicates mirnas as the major player in shaping the expression patterns of these genes, as opposed to other factors. functionally, cattle-specific mirnas might be associated with the insulin signalling pathway, and thus potentially have a role in the evolution of insulin resistance in ruminants. it would be worthwhile to analyse how species-specific mirnas modulate target gene expression divergence across other model animal species for species-specific functions.

in this study, we found more target genes with cattle-specific target sites for cattle-specific mirnas than for non-cattle-specific mirnas and we observed accelerated sequence evolution of target sites of cattle-specific mirnas. this accelerated evolution suggests that selection might have favoured the formation of new target sites. previous studies have primarily focused on conserved target sites but our findings suggest that the non-conserved targets may represent novel mechanisms of genetic regulation that can contribute to species-specific phenotype. based on target gene expression analyses, we showed that cattle-specific mirnas have effects on targets genes of both types: those with conserved targets sites and those with cattle-specific target sites. thus these mirnas may fine tune pre-existing regulatory mechanisms as well as contribute to the formation of new regulatory mechanisms.

CONCLUSIONS
we provide evidence of rapid mirna-mediated regulatory evolution in the ruminant lineage. cattle-specific mirnas play an important role in shaping gene expression divergence between ruminant and non-ruminant species, by influencing the expression of target genes with either conserved or cattle-specific target sites. one interesting potential role for these mirnas is to increase insulin resistance in ruminants by targeting insulin signalling.
