BACKGROUND
termination of translation of mrna is governed by stop codons in the ribosomal a-site and polypeptide chain release factors of two classes. class i release factors rf <dig> and rf <dig> in bacteria recognize uaa/uag and uaa/uga stop codons, respectively, whereas eukaryotes employ only one such factor, erf <dig>  which is able to decode all three nonsense codons  <cit> . the release factors of class i bind to the ribosomal a site, recognize the stop codon, and promote hydrolysis of the p-site peptidyl-trna to release completed polypeptide chain from the ribosome. translation termination is stimulated by class ii release factors, rf <dig> in bacteria, and erf <dig> in eukaryotes. both class ii factors are gtpases enhancing the termination efficiency by stimulating activity of class i release factors in a gtp-dependent manner  <cit> .

determination of the crystal structure of human erf <dig> has shown that it is composed of three domains and resembles by overall shape and dimensions a trna molecule with the n-terminal and middle domains corresponding to the trna's anticodon stem and aminoacyl acceptor stem, respectively  <cit> . erf <dig> also has a complex structure and can be divided into at least two regions: a non-conserved n-terminal region and a conserved c-terminal region , showing a considerable sequence similarity to the translation elongation factor eef1a, which brings aminoacyl-trnas to the ribosomal a site  <cit> . in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae erf <dig> and erf <dig> are encoded by the essential sup <dig> and sup <dig> genes.

according to recent data, erf <dig> functions in termination by applying its gtpase activity to assist erf <dig> with stop codon recognition and ensures efficient hydrolysis of peptidyl trna  <cit> . binding of erf <dig> and erf3·gtp to the pretermination ribosome forms a complex that is not active in peptide release, and further rearrangement, induced by gtp hydrolysis, is required for proper positioning of the ggq loop of erf <dig> in the peptidyl transferase center and triggering peptidyl-trna hydrolysis  <cit> .

it is known that bacterial ribosomes can accelerate gdp for gtp exchange on rf <dig>  <cit> . in contrast, 80s ribosomes do not noticeably influence either binding of guanine nucleotides to the erf1·erf <dig> complex or gdp for gtp exchange on it  <cit> . in vitro studies have shown that while free erf <dig> binds gdp, it binds gtp only in the presence of erf <dig>  <cit> . however, kinetic analysis of interaction of erf <dig> with guanine nucleotides demonstrated that erf <dig> does not act like a classical guanine nucleotide exchange factor , which increases the dissociation of gdp from a gtpase, but rather as a gtp dissociation inhibitor for erf <dig>  promoting efficient ribosomal recruitment of its gtp-bound form  <cit> .

importantly, our knowledge of the mechanism of translation termination is mostly based on in vitro studies. however, genetic approaches allowed to reveal new molecular partners of both erf <dig> and erf <dig> in yeast  <cit>  as well, as their functions unrelated to translation termination  <cit> . here, we present results of the search for additional proteins functionally interacting with yeast erf <dig> and erf <dig>  we found that extra copies of genes which encode the γ  and α  subunits of the translation elongation factor eef1b, known to catalyze the exchange of bound gdp for gtp on eef1a, suppressed synthetic lethal interaction between some mutant sup <dig> and sup <dig> alleles. besides, extra copies of tef <dig> and tef <dig> relieved temperature sensitivity of some mutants in these genes and reduced nonsense readthrough in one of the sup <dig> mutants. overproduction of eef1bα also reduced nonsense readthrough in the sup <dig> mutant and in the strain carrying ochre suppressor trna. the described effects most likely were not mediated by an increase of eef1a activity. obtained results allowed us to suggest that the observed effects are mediated by the ability of yeast eef1b to stimulate guanine-nucleotide exchange on erf <dig> 

methods
strains, media, growth conditions and genetic methods
yeast strains were grown in either yepd  or defined synthetic complete media  supplemented with 2% dextrose as a carbon source. the 5-fluoroorotic acid  medium was prepared as described  <cit> . the final concentration of 5foa was  <dig>  mg/ml. the expression of the teto2-controlled sup <dig> was repressed by incubation of corresponding strains on medium selective for the pcm183-sup <dig> plasmid which contained  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline. lb and 2× yt media were used for bacteria  <cit> . appropriate amounts of antibiotics, amino acids, and bases were added when necessary. yeast cells were grown at 30°c, if not indicated otherwise, and bacteria at 37°c. dna transformation of lithium acetate-treated yeast cells was performed as described previously  <cit> . escherichia coli cells were transformed by the method described in  <cit> . e. coli strain dh5α  was used in cloning experiments  <cit> . the yeast strains used are listed along with their genotypes in table  <dig>  to construct the strain by4741-Δsup <dig>  the sup <dig> gene was deleted in the strain by <dig>  with the use of the eco32i-noti fragment of pbss35::h <dig> as a disruption cassette. pcr was used to prove correct integration of the disruption cassettes.

plasmids and nucleic acid manipulation
all dna manipulations were carried out by standard protocols  <cit> . the plasmids used are listed along with their essential characteristics in table  <dig>  the plasmid yeplac195-sup <dig> was constructed by inserting the sup45-containing xbai-pvuii fragment of the prg415-sup <dig> plasmid into the xbai and smai sites of yeplac <dig>  the mutant alleles of sup <dig>  namely sup35-168ts and sup35-196ts, were amplified by pcr  using genomic dna of the strains 8v-h80- <dig>  and 8v-h80- <dig>  as a template. the amplification products were digested with xbai and saci and inserted into the same sites of prs <dig>  thus creating the prs315-sup35- <dig> or prs315-sup35- <dig> plasmids. the plasmid mutant alleles were sequenced. to construct yeplac181-sup35c, the ecori-xbai fragment carrying sup35-c of the prs315-sup35c plasmid  <cit>  was inserted between the same sites of yeplac <dig> 

to obtain a yeast genomic library, chromosomal dna of the 5v-h <dig> strain  <cit>  was partially digested with sau3a, fractionated on agarose gel and dna fragments ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kb were isolated. the ends of chromosomal dna fragments were partially filled in with klenow enzyme and ligated to the partially filled in sali site of the yeplac <dig> plasmid. a plasmid with the  <dig>  kb chromosomal dna fragment containing tef <dig> and rrp <dig> was isolated from the genomic library. the ecori-smai tef4-containing fragment of this plasmid was inserted into the same sites of yeplac <dig>  thus resulting in yeplac195-tef <dig>  the intronless variant of tef <dig>  was obtained as follows. the tef4-containing psti-ecori dna fragment of yeplac195-tef <dig> was inserted between the same sites of puc <dig>  <cit> . the obtained plasmid was used as a template for pcr with the primers tef4e1r and tef4e2d . amplified dna fragment, representing the plasmid lacking tef <dig> intron sequence, was self ligated, resulting in the plasmid bearing tef4-Δi. the tef4-Δi-containing psti-ecori dna fragment of this plasmid was inserted between the same sites of yeplac <dig> resulting in the plasmid yeplac181-tef4Δi.

the tef <dig> gene was amplified by pcr  using genomic dna of the strain 33g-d <dig> as a template. the amplification product was digested with xbai and inserted into the xbai and smai sites of yeplac <dig>  thus generating yeplac181-tef <dig>  the tef <dig> gene was amplified by pcr  using genomic dna of 33g-d <dig> as a template. the amplification product was digested with bamhi and inserted into the bamhi and ecl136ii sites of yeplac <dig>  thus generating yeplac195-tef <dig>  the intronless variant of tef <dig>  was obtained as follows. the tef5-containing bamhi-saci fragment of yeplac195-tef <dig> was inserted between the same sites of the puc <dig> plasmid  <cit> . the obtained plasmid was used as a template for pcr with primers efb1e1rev and efb1e2dir . amplified dna fragment with tef <dig> lacking intron sequence, was self ligated to obtain the plasmid bearing tef5-Δi. the tef5-Δi-containing bamhi-ecl136ii dna fragment of this plasmid was inserted between the same sites of yeplac <dig> and yeplac <dig>  thus resulting in the plasmids yeplac181-tef5Δi and yeplac195-tef5Δi, respectively. the presence of the multicopy plasmid yeplac181-tef5Δi in yeast cells caused approximately 6-fold overproduction of eef1bα, as was shown by probing appropriately diluted cell lysates with the mouse polyclonal antibody against eef1bα. the tef <dig> gene was amplified by pcr  using genomic dna of 33g-d <dig> as a template. the amplification product was digested with bamhi and inserted into the bamhi and ecl136ii sites of yeplac <dig>  thus generating yeplac195-tef <dig>  the plasmid yeplac181-tef <dig> was constructed by inserting the bamhi-snabi fragment of yeplac195-tef <dig> containing tef <dig> into the same sites of yeplac <dig>  to construct the sup <dig> disruption cassette , the eco105i-muni internal fragment of the sup <dig> gene was replaced with the his <dig> selectable marker.

determination of the efficiency of nonsense codon readthrough
following plasmids carrying tandem renilla and firefly luciferase genes separated by a single in-frame stop codon or a corresponding sense codon control were used to measure the efficiency of nonsense codon readthrough: pdb <dig> , pdb <dig> , pdb <dig> , pdb <dig> , pdb <dig>  and pdb <dig>   <cit> . luciferase assays were performed with a dual luciferase reporter assay system . assays were performed as described  <cit>  with minimal modifications using glomax 20/ <dig> luminometer . assays were done in triplicate, and the data are expressed as the means ± the standard errors. the percent readthrough in each strain is expressed as the ratio of renilla luciferase activity/firefly luciferase activity  divided by the ratio of renilla luciferase activity/firefly luciferase activity  multiplied by  <dig>  for other details, see  <cit> .

RESULTS
tef <dig>  tef <dig> and tef <dig> extra copies suppress synthetic lethal interaction between the sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c mutant alleles
earlier, we have identified mutations in the sup <dig> gene which manifest lethality in combination with the sup35-c allele, which encodes erf <dig> lacking the inessential n-terminal region. the study of these mutations and their lethal interaction with sup35-c indicated the role of n-terminal region of yeast erf <dig> in uncharacterized non-translational function of the erf1·erf <dig> termination complex  <cit> . to clarify the non-translational mechanisms associated with the erf1·erf <dig> complex we performed a screen for dosage suppressors of this synthetic lethality. to isolate such suppressors, we used the strain 33g-d373-rsl23-r35c which carried the sup45-sl23ts mutation and the sup35-c allele, as well as the centromeric pcm183-sup <dig> plasmid with the trp <dig> selectable marker and sup <dig> under the control of regulatable teto <dig> promoter  <cit> . this strain, which was unable to grow on medium containing  <dig> μg/ml doxycycline due to repression of the plasmid wild type sup <dig> gene, was transformed with a s. cerevisiae genomic library based on the multicopy plasmid yeplac <dig>  carrying the ura <dig> selectable marker. the transformants were selected on uracil omission medium, which contained doxycycline. from about one hundred of transformants selected only two were unable to grow on medium containing doxycycline after the loss of the library plasmid on 5foa medium. restriction analysis showed that these transformants contained plasmids with identical  <dig>  kb inserts of genomic dna. both plasmids carried a dna fragment with the tef <dig> and rrp <dig> genes encoding a subunit of the translation elongation factor eef1b  <cit>  and the rrp <dig> protein involved in ribosome synthesis and positioning of the mitotic spindle  <cit> , respectively, but subsequent deletion analysis indicated that suppression required the presence of tef <dig> alone .

eef1b serves as a gef for eef1a, accelerating dissociation of its complex with gdp. in contrast to mammals, in which eef1b is composed of three subunits, α, β and γ, yeast eef1b contains only two of them, α and γ. yeast eef1bγ is encoded by two inessential genes, tef <dig> and tef <dig>  <cit> , and probably serves as a positive regulator of the catalytic eef1bα subunit  <cit> , which is encoded by a single essential gene tef <dig>  <cit> . we isolated the genomic tef <dig> and tef <dig> genes to study the ability of their extra copies to suppress synthetic lethal interaction between sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c. the tef <dig> and tef <dig> genes contain intervening sequences encoding the small nucleolar rnas snr <dig> and snr <dig>  respectively. the latter rna was shown to be involved in fine tuning of translation termination in yeast  <cit> . to determine, whether the overproduction of the tef4- and tef5-encoded proteins themselves was responsible for suppression of synthetic lethality, we constructed multicopy plasmids carrying the tef <dig> or tef <dig> genes without introns . surprisingly, a spot test did not reveal any noticeable suppressor effect for tef4-Δi extra copies, while high dosage of tef <dig> and tef5-Δi suppressed synthetic lethality . it is noteworthy that the absence of suppression for the tef4-Δi extra copies was not due to the lack of an intron, since no suppression in a spot test was observed in transformants carrying the plasmid with wild type tef <dig> . this discrepancy indicates that tef <dig> extra copies suppress synthetic lethality less efficiently than extra copies of either tef <dig> or tef <dig> 

the sup45-sl23ts mutation is not the only mutation in the sup <dig> gene manifesting synthetic lethality with sup35-c; the same effect was found for the sup45-36ts mutation  <cit> . both mutations altered the n domain of erf <dig> and caused substitutions of amino acids located in proximity to each other, ser <dig> to phe replacement in the sup45-sl23ts mutant  <cit>  and leu <dig> to ser in sup45-36ts . <cit> . however, tef5-Δi was unable to act as a dosage suppressor of the lethal interaction between sup45-36ts and sup35-c indicating the sup <dig> allele specificity of the suppressor effect.

temperature sensitivity of sup <dig> and sup <dig> mutants can be suppressed by overproduction of eef1b subunits
the data obtained indicated a role of eef1b in functioning of the erf1·erf <dig> complex. this raised a question, whether eef1b overproduction can suppress mutational defects of the individual components of this complex? to address this question, we examined, if temperature sensitivity of the sup45-sl23ts and sup45-36ts mutants and some sup35ts mutants can be alleviated by the identified dosage suppressors. efficient suppression of temperature sensitivity of the strain 33g-d373-rsl <dig>  carrying the sup45-sl23ts mutation, was revealed only for extra copies of the tef5-Δi gene. extra copies of the tef <dig> but not of the tef <dig> gene caused weak but reproducible alleviation of the sup45-sl23ts temperature sensitivity . this difference in the suppression efficiency can be expected, since eefb1γ, encoded by tef <dig>  is a regulatory subunit which stimulates activity of the tef5-encoded eefb1α  <cit> . importantly, extra copies of tef5-Δi did not suppress temperature sensitivity of the sup45-36ts mutant 33g-d373-r <dig>  which agrees with the sup <dig> allele specific suppression of synthetic lethality .

since tef <dig> was found to be the most efficient dosage suppressor of temperature sensitivity of the sup45-sl23ts mutant, effects of its extra copies on growth of sup <dig> mutants were studied further. examination of  <dig> sup35ts mutants of the strain 8v-h <dig> revealed two mutants with phenotypes that depended on the presence of the tef5-Δi multicopy plasmid: temperature sensitivity of the sup35-168ts mutant was suppressed, while growth of the sup35-196ts was inhibited even at permissive temperature . the ability of tef5-Δi extra copies to suppress temperature sensitivity of sup35-168ts was reproduced in the by4741-Δsup <dig> strain. interestingly, extra copies of sup <dig> also alleviated temperature sensitivity of the sup35-168ts mutant . similar effect of sup <dig> overdose was earlier shown for other sup35ts mutants  <cit> .

sequencing of the sup35ts mutant alleles, manifestation of which depended on tef5-Δi extra copies, revealed that the mutations altered the c-terminal region of erf <dig> located downstream of its gtp-binding domain: sup35-168ts caused replacement of leu <dig> to pro, while nucleotide substitution in the sup35-196ts allele corresponded to change of thr <dig> to pro.

extra copies of tef <dig> and tef <dig> reduce efficiency of nonsense codon readthrough
genetic interactions described above show that eef1b is functionally related to the yeast release factors, but do not indicate its involvement in translation termination. to test the latter possibility we investigated the influence of a high dosage of the genes for eef1b subunits on nonsense readthrough in the sup <dig> and sup <dig> omnipotent suppressor mutants. extra copies of tef5-Δi decreased the levels of uaa и uga readthrough in the sup45-sl23ts mutant almost to the levels observed in this strain in the presence of wild type sup <dig>  but did not affect readthrough of uag . a smaller decrease of uaa readthrough due to eef1bα overproduction was found in the strain carrying the sup35-196ts mutation, though this effect was statistically insignificant in the sup35-168ts mutant . the observed effects agree with the fact that extra copies of tef <dig> weakened suppression of the his7- <dig> uaa mutation in the strain with the sup35- <dig> omnipotent suppressor  <cit> . however, other results demonstrated that overproduction of eef1bα could increase the levels of nonsense readthrough in strains lacking suppressor mutations  <cit> .

in addition to tef5-Δi, a decrease of uaa readthrough in the sup45-sl23ts mutant was also observed for a high dosage of tef <dig>  but not of tef4-Δi . at last, overproduction of eef1bα manifested an antisuppressor effect not only in the sup <dig> and sup <dig> suppressor mutants, since it reduced the levels of nonsense readthrough caused by the ochre trna suppressor sup <dig> in the strain 50v-h <dig>  remarkably, sup35-c overdose caused in this strain just a slightly stronger antisuppressor effect than extra copies of tef5-Δi .

effects of eef1b overproduction are not mediated by an increase of eef1a activity
translation elongation factor eef1a is a classic g protein involved in the gtp-dependent binding of amino-acylated trna, and the eef1b α subunit, associated with its γ subunit, functions as a gef for eef1a  <cit> . this suggests that the effects of overproduction of eef1b subunits, observed in our work, are mediated by an increased activity of its target protein, eef1a. however, extra copies of tef <dig>  one of the two yeast genes encoding eef1a, neither suppressed synthetic lethality between sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c , nor alleviated temperature sensitivity of the sup35-168ts or sup45-sl23ts mutants , thus ruling out this possibility. in contrast, extra copies of tef <dig> could even inhibit growth of the sup35-168ts and sup45-sl23ts mutants, though in these experiments growth inhibition was not observed when the strains expressed wild type sup <dig>  or sup <dig> .

measurement of nonsense readthrough levels confirmed this conclusion: in contrast to tef5-Δi and tef <dig>  the overdose of which caused an antisuppressor effect, extra copies of tef <dig> either did not reduce uaa readthrough in the sup <dig> ochre suppressor-carrying strain , or even stimulated it in the sup45-sl23ts mutant . it is also necessary to stress that in contrast to tef <dig>  extra copies of sup35-c caused a decrease of uaa readthrough in the sup <dig> strain .

discussion
in eukaryotes a gtp-bound form of erf <dig> is active in termination, because gtp hydrolysis by erf <dig> on the ribosome is required for the efficient translation termination  <cit> . however, in vivo erf <dig> should mostly be present in its gdp-bound form, since  when termination is completed it is released from the ribosome in a complex with gdp, and  newly synthesized erf <dig> has a high affinity to gdp, being able to bind gtp only upon interaction with erf <dig>  <cit> . it is also important that though erf <dig> is able to enhance the levels of the gtp-bound form of erf <dig>  it does not act like classic gefs, which increase the dissociation of gdp from a gtpase  <cit> . since no gef was identified for erf <dig>  it could be that it is able to dissociate gdp spontaneously similarly to eef1a which can do this, although with a 700-fold slower rate than with the assistance of eefb <dig>  <cit> . however, despite this, the results of our work suggest that eefb <dig> acts as a gef for erf <dig>  this suggestion is based on  the functional interaction of the α and γ subunits of eef1b with the release factors and  the reduced nonsense readthrough caused by overproduction of eef1b subunits. it is also necessary to stress that eef1bγ and eef1bα are structurally different proteins and the former can stimulate in vitro the nucleotide exchange activity of the latter  <cit> . this additionally relates the observed effects of their overproduction to the role of the eef1b factor in gdp/gtp exchange on erf <dig>  it is noteworthy that the effects of an overdose of the tef3- and tef4-encoded γ subunit of eef1b were different. while extra copies of either gene can suppress synthetic lethal interaction between the sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c mutant alleles, only tef <dig> extra copies reduce nonsense readthrough in the sup45-sl23ts mutant and alleviate its growth at restrictive temperature. this indicates a functional difference between tef3- and tef4-encoded proteins, which agrees with earlier findings  <cit> . it may be suggested that the complex of eef1bα with the tef3-encoded protein preferentially stimulates guanine-nucleotide exchange on erf <dig>  while its complex with the tef4-encoded eef1bγ has a preference for eef1a.

since eef1b acts as gef for eef1a, its overproduction should increase the concentration of active  eef1a. however, it is unlikely that the effects of eef1b overproduction observed in this work were mediated by activation of eef1a, because extra copies of tef <dig> did not suppress synthetic lethality between sup45-sl23ts and sup35-c, as well as temperature sensitivity of the sup35-168ts and sup45-sl23ts mutants and even could inhibit growth of these mutants. it is known that, besides translation, overexpression of eef1a in yeast also affects actin cytoskeleton which may be the cause of growth inhibition  <cit> . however, we observed that extra copies of tef <dig> caused a noticeable growth inhibition only when mutant sup <dig> or sup <dig> alleles were expressed. similarly to eef1a, yeast erf <dig> and erf <dig> have nontranslational functions and their deficiency, as well as mutational inactivation, may inhibit yeast cell growth via perturbations of the cytoskeleton organization  <cit> . therefore, one can suggest that tef <dig> extra copies and sup <dig> or sup <dig> mutations act synergistically to affect cytoskeleton. it is also important that extra copies of tef <dig> did not influence nonsense readthrough in the strain with the sup <dig> trna ochre suppressor and even increased it in the sup45-sl23ts mutant. at the same time, in contrast to tef <dig>  extra copies of sup35-c, encoding the c domain of erf <dig> caused a decrease of uaa readthrough in the sup <dig> strain, which also makes erf <dig> an appropriate target for the eef1b action.

it is noteworthy that an overproduction of eef1bα suppressed temperature sensitivity of the sup35-168ts mutant, but did not noticeably reduce nonsense codon readthrough indicating that temperature sensitivity of this mutant is not due to a defect of translation termination. this suggests that even slight stimulation of gdp for gtp exchange on erf <dig>  which did not restore translation termination in the sup35-168ts mutant, could repair defect of the non-translational function of mutant erf <dig>  temperature sensitivity of sup45-sl23ts is also unrelated to a high level of nonsense readthrough  <cit> , though in this mutant overproduction of eef1bα alleviated the growth defect and decreased uaa and uga readthrough. importantly, overproduction of eef1bα did not suppress temperature sensitivity of the sup45-36ts mutant. it was shown that at restrictive temperature the sup45-36ts mutation affects cytokinesis due to a defect of the non-translational function of erf <dig> mediated by its interaction with the myosin light chain mlc <dig>  since the erf1·mlc <dig> complex, does not contain erf <dig>  <cit> , it is logical that temperature sensitivity of this mutant did not depend on the levels of eef1bα.

taken together, these data suggest that the guanine-nucleotide exchange activity of eef1b plays a role in the functioning of release factors in translation termination as well as in their functions outside of termination. though the mechanisms which underlie suppression of mutational defects of erf <dig> and erf <dig> by overproduction of the eef1b subunits are unknown, this suggestion looks natural for the sup <dig> mutants, since it presumes that eef1b acts as a gef for erf <dig>  however, an overdose of the eef1bα can also suppress the mutational defect of erf <dig>  the suppressible sup45-sl23ts mutation causes amino acid replacement in the erf <dig> n-terminal domain which is not implicated in interaction with erf <dig>  in agreement with this, sup45-sl23ts did not noticeably influence interaction between erf <dig> and erf <dig>  <cit> . therefore, one can suggest that this mutation interferes with the ability of erf <dig> to inhibit dissociation of the erf3·gtp complex. this should decrease the overall levels of the ternary erf1·erf3·gtp complex, the abundance of which could be restored by the eef1b-mediated intensification of exchange of gdp for gtp on erf <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented suggest that eef1b, the nucleotide exchange factor of eef1a, also catalyzes gdp for gtp exchange on erf <dig>  a gtpase, the c domain of which is structurally similar to eef1a  <cit> . this reaction is required for erf <dig> function both in translation termination and outside of termination. however, it is obvious that in yeast the eef1b-mediated exchange of nucleotides is more critical for eef1a than for erf <dig>  this follows from the observations that while eef1bα is normally essential for viability, cells can survive without the protein in the presence of excess eef1a  <cit> . one can suppose that the requirement for gef is less pronounced for erf <dig> than for eef1a, because of a unique property of erf <dig> to increase affinity of erf <dig> to gtp. indeed, interaction with erf <dig> stabilizes erf <dig> in a gtp-bound form after spontaneous exchange of gdp for gtp  <cit> . no such inhibitor of gtp dissociation is known for eef1a.

structural similarity suggests that erf <dig> has evolved from eef1a. our genetic data suggest that the accessory protein, eef1b, stimulating the activity of elongation factor eef1a preserved this ability for the termination factor erf <dig> as well. direct biochemical studies are necessary to confirm the role of eef1b in nucleotide exchange on erf <dig>
