BACKGROUND
the development of high-throughput analytical methods for genes and gene products and the wealth of information obtained in recent years combined with extensive annotation allows for a genome-wide view on the saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome. in systems biology studies of signal transduction pathways, the natural first step to model the dynamics operation of these pathway are to identify the proteins acting in the studied pathway and the interactions between them. therefore there is an increasing interest in identification of all protein-protein interactions in the model organism s. cerevisiae  <cit> , and in recent studies the protein-protein interactions for single protein kinases were mapped  <cit> .

there have been many attempts to reconstruct signal transduction pathways   <cit> , and extensive databases are available, e.g. biogrid, sgd, containing information on the components of different stps. there is also an increasing amount of data on how proteins assemble in cells. the analysis of all this data has allowed for identification of new pathways and also refined our models for previously known pathways  <cit> , and using protein chips more than  <dig> phosphorylation events including  <dig> different proteins have been identified by snyder et. al.,  <dig> 

the full datasets of protein-protein interaction used in our study were available from different sources such as the literature, large scale microarray experiments and whole genome two hybrid screenings. whole protein-protein interaction networks allows for inferring protein networks that are involved in the same cellular processes  <cit> , and through comparison with published data the most likely topologies of specific pathways can be identified and this can be used to design further experiments that can test the different predictions.

in this study we present the first step towards an integrated reconstruction of key signal transduction pathways in s. cerevisiae. our focus is on the interactions of the protein kinases snf <dig>  tor <dig>  hog <dig> and pka <dig>  as these protein kinases play a central role in regulation of nutrient uptake, energy, carbon and nitrogen metabolisms. these four protein kinases are all involved in the regulation of energy homeostasis in the cell. snf <dig> is one of the main regulators of the diauxic shift from fermentative to respirative metabolic state in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and its mammalian counterpart, ampk, is a metabolic regulator involved in activation of catabolic processes such as Î²-oxidation and repression of energy consuming reactions such as lipid biosynthesis, and hereby it plays a central role in metabolic disorders such as diabetes and the metabolic syndrome  <cit> . tor controls cell growth in response to nutrient availability and stress and it exists in s. cerevisiae in two structurally and functionally distinct protein complexes termed torc <dig> and torc <dig>  <cit> . global nutrient-sensing signal transduction cascades like tor and ras activate pka <dig> in response to glucose availability  <cit> . protein kinase a, or pka <dig>  is a key player in regulation of carbon metabolism. when the camp concentration increases and binds to the regulatory subunits of protein kinas a, the subunits dissociate from the protein complex and the kinase is activated  <cit> . stress resistance of s. cerevisiae is to a large extent dependent on the protein kinase hog <dig>  which among other things regulate the glycerol production in response to hyper osmotic conditions  <cit> . since these four protein kinases are key players in regulation of energy metabolism and highly conserved among eukaryotes  <cit> , they are also of relevance in understanding of metabolic diseases such as the metabolic syndrome related diseases, such as arteriosclerosis, diabetes type ii and hypertension. therefore, understanding the integrated function of these protein kinases is of great importance in development of effective therapies for metabolic diseases. the four protein kinases are also considered to be crucial elements of transcriptional, metabolic and developmental regulation in response to stress  <cit> . inactivation of hog <dig> has for example been observed to significantly attenuate the transcriptional response to osmotic stresses  <cit> .

reconstruction of protein-protein interactions are important for understanding cellular networks  <cit> , and based on recent development of new high throughput technologies ppis have accumulated rapidly  <cit> . there are several methods available to find ppis such as yeast two hybrid  <cit> , tandem affinity purification and computational method like phylogenic profile, correlated domain signature method and integrative methods  <cit> . most of these approaches cover only a sub-set of possible interactions. wang et. al.,  <dig> tried to integrate protein-protein features from multiple data sources  <cit> . besides the reconstruction of ppis there have also been developed different methods for analysis of these networks  <cit> , such as residue spatial sequence profile and evolution rate  <cit> , structural information  <cit> , and residue conservation scores  <cit> .

here the reconstructed network is presented in a platform that will allow continued annotation, e.g. in a community based effort in analogy with what has recently been done for genome-scale metabolic models of yeast  <cit> . databases like sgd, biogrid and several papers describe the function and interaction of the individual kinases, but there has so far not been an made an integrated interaction networks of these four key protein kinases that unite all key nutrient and energy sensing stps in s. cerevisiae. the aim of our reconstruction is to present the first integrated network reconstruction of how these four key protein kinases interact, with annotations of the different interactions according to the current knowledge, and further evaluate the role of this interaction network in global metabolic regulation. we specifically wanted to study how these four protein kinase function in concert and we therefore only considered direct neighbours of these protein kinases. the reconstructed protein-protein network is analyzed in terms of its connectivity, and the network is used as a framework for analysis of transcriptome data of s. cerevisiae grown at different environmental conditions expected to affect the function of these key stp.

RESULTS
annotations for protein-protein interactions
towards the aim of reconstructing a global protein-protein interaction map for s. cerevisiae, we focused on protein interactions with the four key protein kinases snf <dig>  tor <dig>  hog <dig> and pka <dig>  these four protein kinases are highly conserved among eukaryotic cells and they play a central role in integrating cellular responses to nutrients and stress, and hereby balancing metabolic functions to ensure proper cell growth and proliferation. due to their central role in regulating key pathways these protein kinases are also key drug targets for many important diseases e.g. diabetes and cancer. the protein-protein interaction network around these four protein kinases was reconstructed and annotated in celldesigner using the following steps .

a. for each of the four key protein kinases the interaction neighbors were identified using different databases and literature information. each interaction was annotated into the following categories:

 known physical interactions

 known functional interactions

b. all interactions were annotated with available information as references in the celldesigner model.

c. the reconstructed interaction network was integrated into a novel visualization mode named the binary matrix. the binary matrix is a simple representation of the whole interaction network with annotations for each protein and interaction stored in an excel sheet.

d. finally the reconstructed sub-networks of each of the protein kinases were combined into one super-network through shared proteins.

thus, the large-scale protein-protein interaction reconstruction includes four key protein kinases and their neighboring proteins, and with the use of the celldesigner platform the reconstructed model can easily be represented in sbml. furthermore, the network is curated with  <dig> references and it therefore also represents a valuable database on protein-protein interaction.

the  <dig> key proteins connect with other proteins in different combinations , and these connections can be represented as a venn diagram that indicates the overlap in interaction around the four protein kinases . the positions of the proteins in the network are defined by the number  <dig> to  <dig> in the venn diagram. from the reconstructed protein-protein interaction network, the number of neighbors of the four key protein kinases could be identified .

information on second and third order interactions
from the venn diagram the numbers of neighboring proteins to the key protein kinases was found and the results are summarized in figure  <dig>  it is found that pka <dig> interacts with most proteins while snf <dig> is the second largest hub in the network.

to mathematically represent the structure of the complex protein-protein interaction network, we converted the interactions into a square matrix where all the proteins are listed in both the row and column dimensions and the matrix elements represent interactions between two proteins. if there is an interaction between two proteins the matrix element is set to  <dig> and if there is no interaction it is set to  <dig> as a sparse array. this binary representation of protein-protein interactions in square matrix form is an approach equivalent to adjacency matrix in graph theory that enables straightforward analysis of second and third order interactions in the network. taking a square of the initial binary matrix returns the second order interactions through one intermediate protein . similarly, if a square of the second order matrix is taken, the third order interactions through two intermediate proteins  are directly obtained. the numbers of intermediate proteins involved in the second and the third order interactions for each protein kinase are shown in figures 3b and 3c, respectively. pka <dig> and snf <dig> are found to have the highest number of proteins involved in their second and third order interactions, respectively.

the matrix representation of the protein-protein interaction network is interesting as it allows for easy analysis of interactions. it also allows for evaluation of the effects of deletion of specific proteins and how this affects different orders of interaction, and hence be used for easy evaluation of robustness of the network to different perturbations.

transcription factors in the reconstruction
the reconstructed network contains a total of  <dig> proteins that have been annotated as transcription factors . the transcription factor annotations were taken from http://www.yeastract.com <cit> . the percentage of interactions with transcription factors were 41%, 32%,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % for snf <dig>  pka <dig>  tor <dig> and hog <dig>  respectively. five transcription factors were observed to interact with two of the hub proteins in the network and only two transcription factors had interactions with more than two of the hub proteins. interactions of the transcription factors with the key protein kinases are visualized as venn diagrams . the transcription factor interactions with snf <dig>  tor <dig> and pka <dig> and snf <dig>  hog <dig> and pka <dig> are shown in figures 5a and 5b, respectively. the intercepts in the venn diagrams show the shared transcription factor interactions among the three protein kinases. hog <dig> and tor <dig> share no common transcription factor interactions according to our current knowledge.

highly active sub-networks
a search for transcriptionally highly active sub-networks  <cit>  was performed in the reconstructed stp network to identify active transcriptional regulatory structures in s. cerevisiae in carbon- and nitrogen-limited conditions at three different specific growth rates:  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  h- <dig>  the search of highly active sub-networks was performed twice in series, since the first sub-networks identified were found to be large including a high fraction of nodes of the reconstructed network. the second search was performed inside the networks identified with the first search. the transcriptionally highly active subnetworks are shown in figure  <dig>  the first sub-networks included all the four hub proteins except in case of specific growth rate  <dig>  h- <dig> where snf <dig> was not found to be included in the sub-network. the sub-networks from the second search included tor <dig> and pka <dig> interactions for growth rates of  <dig>  h- <dig> and  <dig>  h- <dig>  for the growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> the second sub-network showed that tor <dig> and pka <dig> had three common interaction proteins: gat <dig>  hom <dig>  and rim <dig>  these three proteins are annotated to have nitrogen metabolism or glucose repression dependent function. for the growth rate of  <dig>  h- <dig> the second sub-network showed that tor <dig> and pka <dig> shared interactions to gat <dig> and rim <dig> both related to nitrogen metabolism. for the lowest growth rate,  <dig>  h- <dig>  the second sub-network showed that tor <dig> and pka <dig> shared interactions only to gat <dig> whereas snf <dig> shared interactions to fox <dig>  pfk <dig>  pfk <dig> and pho <dig> with pka <dig> 

the proteins included in the highly active sub-networks having interactions with more than one key protein kinases are particularly interesting as they point to cross talk between the four different regulatory networks. furthermore, the transcription factors having shared interactions to the protein kinases, that were present in the sub-networks, have probably been active regulators of transcription in the conditions studied. thus, tor <dig> and pka <dig> share interactions to the transcription factors gat <dig>  gln <dig> and gzf <dig> that are involved in nitrogen metabolism and could have been mediators of the transcriptional changes in the studied conditions. especially gat <dig> is interesting as the directions of its interactions with the key kinases allow for information passing from tor <dig> to pka <dig>  at the low specific growth rate  in addition to tor <dig> and pka <dig> also snf <dig> interactions were found. low specific growth rates have been proposed to cause stress in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and the snf <dig> interaction network activity could be seen as a stress response. thus, at the low specific growth rate there was observed a probable interaction between the global energy metabolism regulation and nutrient-sensing through common protein components. tor <dig>  pka <dig> and snf <dig> share interactions to the transcription factors gln <dig> and gzf <dig> that thus can be considered as probable active transcriptional regulators at low specific growth rate conditions.

comparison to published large scale protein-protein interaction networks
the congruity of large scale protein-protein interaction networks and the large-scale study of the substrates of the yeast kinases by snyder et al.   <cit>  with the reconstructed protein-protein interaction network of the four key protein kinases studied here was investigated. the large scale protein-protein interaction networks investigated were uetz-screen  <cit> , ito-core  <cit> , y2h-union  <cit> , combined-ap/ms  <cit> , lc-multiple  <cit>  and ccsb-yi <dig>  <cit>  all recently compared in extent and quality by yu et al.   <cit> . only a small fraction of the interactions to the four key protein kinases snf <dig>  tor <dig>  hog <dig> and pka <dig> were included in the previous large scale protein-protein interaction networks compared to what is reported here. none of the investigated large scale protein-protein interaction networks included proteins having interactions with more than one of the four key proteins. thus, all the investigated large scale networks lacked the information on possible signal passing components between the regulatory systems around these four key protein kinases studied here .

the large-scale study of the substrates of protein kinases in yeast  <cit>  included the substrates identified by proteome chip technology for snf <dig> and pka <dig>  in this study snf <dig> and pka <dig> was found to share  <dig> substrates in vitro of which  <dig> proteins with well annotated interactions to both snf <dig> and pka <dig> are also included in the network reconstruction presented here. the other two key protein kinases tor <dig> and hog <dig> were not included in the study by snyder et al.   <cit>  and thus it lacked the information on the possible signal transfer components between the pathways of all the four key protein kinases.

discussion
as a starting point for the development of a comprehensive protein-protein interaction network spanning four key protein kinases, we performed a manual annotation process that combines different kinds of information for every single protein and interactions. the results are presented as files in sbml format  available on our website http://www.sysbio.se/users/subir. this sbml format .xml file will open directly in celldesigner and the full interaction map describes all the available information. the information of protein-protein interactions for these four key protein kinases represents an extensive starting point for further reconstruction of protein-protein interactions in yeast. the main contribution of this paper is the collection of all the interaction partners of the four key protein kinases from different sources into a protein-protein interaction network and to describe the full annotation of the interactions. the reconstructed network serves as an initial platform for reconstruction and annotation of a genome-wide signal transduction network. the presented network includes the four key protein kinases of nutrient sensing and regulation of metabolism, their interaction partners and all the interactions between the key protein kinases and the other proteins. thus, the topology of the network is predetermined.

our reconstruction process resulted in a network that consists of  <dig> proteins and  <dig> protein-protein interactions. in line with the nomenclature used for genome-scale metabolic models we propose to call this reconstructed network ppsk <dig> . in this paper, interactions are fully annotated in the reconstruction which gives more than just a score for a user to evaluate how reliable the interaction is in his/her case and can be able to score the different sources that have been used to collect the interactions .

furthermore, compared to different databases like string where only  <dig> similar interactions have scores our database covered  <dig> more interactions than reported in string based only on the four key protein kinases. annotated information on the interactions is given in the celldesigner file that includes all information together. furthermore the interactions between transcription factors and different protein kinases provides a scaffold for building more detailed models, e.g. to study the dynamics of signal transduction pathways.

the analysis of transcriptionally highly active sub-networks of the integrated protein-protein interaction reconstruction allowed for identification of possible information carriers between the interaction networks of the four key protein kinases in s. cerevisiae in carbon- vs nitrogen-limited conditions at three different specific growth rates. this would not have been feasible using separate regulatory networks for the kinases.

none of the studied large protein-protein interaction networks included the wealth of information on the probable global metabolic regulation and interactions between the nutrient-sensing protein kinases included in the reconstructed network described in this study. thus, the large protein-protein interaction networks could not have supported the above discussed analysis of integrated response of the pathways and identification of probable information carriers between signal transduction pathways of the four key protein kinases. this is the first attempt to combine the signal transduction networks of the four key protein kinases. previously the interaction networks of the key protein kinases have been studied separately. the reconstructed protein-protein interaction network serves as a framework for analysis of nutrient sensing and global regulation of metabolism, for analysis of data, for analysis of information transfer between the regulatory networks of the individual protein kinases and as an initial platform where the reconstruction and annotation of global signal transduction network can be conveniently continued. the modelling format is carefully chosen to suit continuation of the reconstruction and annotation.

CONCLUSIONS
the sbml-encoded version representation of the model is made available in one of the preferred software platforms for system biology, namely celldesigner. we have examined the sbml format in .xml state in celldesigner and shown that it loads successfully for visualization.

subsets of this model are relevant for some applications and through the celldesigner representation the data are made available as a database that facilitates easy searching in the network. an important function of the celldesigner format is that this is an open ended source that allows each researcher to edit the model and hereby improve the model based on new information. our reconstruction and the used platform are, therefore, well suited for initiating a community effort towards reconstruction of a highly annotated protein-protein interaction network for yeast. this nutrient sensing and global metabolic regulation map in yeast will offer as a valuable resource for the research of s. cerevisiae and also provides insight into this important regulatory network in eukaryotes in general.
