BACKGROUND
water temperature was suggested to be the master factor that determines nearly all life activities of most fishes, including development, growth, reproduction, metabolism, behavior and geographical distribution  <cit> . like other ectotherms, fishes may encounter a wide range of daily and seasonal temperature variations in their habitats and deleterious consequences will occur if water temperature exceeds the species-specific thermal tolerance range  <cit> . it was reported that most of fish kills in nature are caused by exposure to low temperatures  <cit> . thus, the ability to cope with cold stress is quite important for the survival of fishes under natural conditions. furthermore, a large number of commercially important aquaculture species such as tilapia , milkfish  and red sea bream  are sensitive to cold stress and mass mortality is often caused by winter cold fronts  <cit> . therefore, it is of great significance for both scientific researches and fisheries to investigate the mechanisms underlying cold-tolerance of fish.

since the middle of the 20th century, an increasing number of studies were performed to characterize the acclimation responses of fishes to cold stress. it was revealed that fishes can gradually establish cold adaptive phenotypes through extensive biochemical, metabolic and physiological regulations  <cit> . well-defined biochemical and physiological acclimations include producing temperature-specific isozymes  <cit> , altering the content of membrane lipid and the degree of fatty acid unsaturation  <cit> , recruiting different muscle fiber types  <cit> , synthesizing molecular chaperones  <cit> , and altering mitochondrial densities and their properties  <cit> . moreover, microarray techniques have been widely used to profile gene expressions in fishes exposed to short- or long-term cold stresses during the past decade. researchers have characterized the transcriptional responses elicited by cold stress in fishes such as common carp   <cit> , zebrafish   <cit> , channel catfish   <cit> , annual killifish   <cit> , coral reef fish   <cit>  and rainbow trout   <cit> . these investigations have revealed a large number of cold-regulated genes involved in a variety of biological processes that are associated with acclimation to both daily and seasonal low temperatures.

it is well documented that the cold-tolerance of fishes is mainly determined by genetics, thermal history and developmental stages and fishes at larvae stages are more sensitive to cold injury than adults  <cit> . despite the importance of larvae survival for fishery production and the stability of wild population, there is little information about the acclimation of fish larvae to cold stress. in some insects, a phenomenon named “rapid cold hardening ” can be evoked by a mild cold exposure for a period of minutes or a few hours, which is important for protecting insects from cold injury at both organismal and cellular levels  <cit> . the rch response has been described in both chill-sensitive and chill-tolerant insects and is remarkable for its rapid induction  <cit> . however, it is unknown whether fish larvae possess such a rapid acclimation response to cold stress and the transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulations in fish larvae exposed to cold stress remain to be defined.

zebrafish is widely used as a research model for multiple disciplines including developmental biology, genetics, physiology, toxicology and environmental genomics. abundant biological information and genetic resources have been accumulated for this species, e.g., the complete genome sequence and comprehensive annotations, which markedly facilitate investigations using high-throughput techniques such as microarray and rna-seq. moreover, zebrafish is a tropical eurythermal fish that might encounter a wide range of both daily and seasonal temperature fluctuations. zebrafish acclimated to 20°c demonstrated critical thermal maxima  and critical thermal minima  of  <dig> °c and  <dig> °c, respectively  <cit> . we have characterized the gene expression profiles in zebrafish larvae exposed to low or high temperature stress  <cit> , but the post-transcriptional regulations remain unclear due to the limitations of microarray technique. rna-seq is a recently developed approach to determine the transcriptomic profiles using deep-sequencing technologies, which exhibits some advantages over microarray such as the independency of existing genomic sequence, high sensitivity and accuracy, digital expression and the ability to distinguish transcript isoforms  <cit> .

this study aims to characterize the ability of zebrafish larvae to build cold-tolerance after exposed to a mild low temperature and investigate the transcriptional responses elicited by cold stress. we found that 96 hpf zebrafish larvae exposed to a mild low temperature  for 24 h exhibited a significant increase in survival rates under further severe cold stress at 12°c. transcriptional responses behind the formation of cold-tolerance were characterized using rna-seq. the sequencing reads were mapped to zebrafish genome sequence and assembled into transcripts. a total of  <dig>  genes were found to be expressed and differential expression analysis identified  <dig>  up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes. enrichment analysis of gene ontology  terms and kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathways have revealed that rna splicing, protein catabolic process and ribosome biogenesis were the most enriched go terms and that spliceosome, proteosome and ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes were the most overrepresented pathways among cold-induced genes. furthermore, cold stress led to differential splicing of  <dig> genes and promoter switching of  <dig> genes. obviously, these findings would be very important for further understanding the intracellular signaling mechanisms of cold stress in fish.

RESULTS
development of cold resistance in zebrafish larvae
to address whether zebrafish larvae are able to build cold-resistance under a mild low temperature, 96 hpf larvae were incubated at 16°c for 24 h followed by severe cold exposure at 12°c and the controls were maintained at 28°c before severe cold exposure at 12°c . larvae at 96 hpf were used to perform the experiment because larvae at this stage need not to be fed and are less sensitive to cold stress than the earlier stage embryos  <cit> . as shown in figure 1b, the death rates of the pre-treated larvae are significantly lower than those of the control at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 48 h . the death rates after severe cold exposure for  <dig> and 48 h reached  <dig> % and 100% in the control, but were  <dig>  and  <dig> % in the pre-treated group. after severe cold exposure at 12°c for 36 h, the survival larvae in experimental group were normal in morphology; however, most of the control larvae were dead and displayed an obvious body curvature . these findings suggest that zebrafish larvae developed the resistance against severe cold stress after a pre-exposure at 16°c.

mapping of rna-seq reads to zebrafish genome
to reveal the cold acclimation-associated transcriptional responses in larval zebrafish, three biological replicates of both control and cold-treated samples were subjected to total rna extraction and rna-seq analysis. high-throughput sequencing generated  <dig> - <dig>  million  pairs of raw reads for each of the sample and more than 96% of the raw reads passed quality filtering  . after the quality filtering, paired reads were extracted and mapped to the zebrafish genome using tophat. a total of  <dig> - <dig>  m reads were processed by tophat and the percent of mapped reads were quite similar among different samples . the number of total mapping events generated by tophat was  <dig> - <dig>  m and the number of potential splices was  <dig> - <dig>  m, representing  <dig> - <dig> % of the total alignment. the ratio of unique map to the total alignment was  <dig> - <dig> %; however, the ratio of uniquely mapped reads to the total number of processed reads was  <dig> - <dig> % .

% unique mapping indicates the ratio of unique mapping to the total alignment.

gene expression detected by rna-seq
the mapping data generated by tophat was processed by cufflinks toolkits for transcript assembly and differential expression analysis. the abundance of gene transcripts was expressed as fpkm   <cit> . to identify expressed genes, background coverage for intergenic regions was calculated as well. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the mean background coverage was  <dig>  fpkm and a significant decrease in frequency occurred at  <dig>  fpkm. therefore, genes with a mean abundance >  <dig>  fpkm in either the control or cold-treated samples were regarded as being expressed and a total of  <dig>  expressed genes were detected in this study .

as shown in figure 2a and b, the abundance of most genes was less than  <dig> fpkm and both the control and cold-treated samples demonstrated a bimodal frequency curve of fpkm values. the first peak of the frequency curves was located at  <dig>  fpkm and the second peak was located at  <dig>  and  <dig>  fpkm for the control and cold-treated samples, respectively. the trough between the two peaks was near  <dig> fpkm and the baselines of the second frequency peak range from  <dig> to  <dig> fpkm for both groups . therefore, genes were classified as low , medium  and high abundance  according to their fpkm values. the largest portion  of expressed genes belongs to the medium-abundance, followed by low-abundance genes . a smaller number of medium-abundance genes and a larger number of high-abundance genes were detected in cold-treated samples than those in the control, suggesting that the expression of many genes was induced in cold-treated larvae.

principle component analysis  was performed to characterize the overall effects of cold stress on gene expression. the results of pca indicate that  <dig> % of the variations in gene expression can be explained by the first two principle components . the inter-group and intra-group variations in gene expression were captured by pc <dig> and pc <dig> respectively . pca projections of the control and cold-treated samples in the principle component space exhibited a clear discrepancy, indicating that significant variations in gene expression occurred after cold exposure.

the differentially expressed genes between the control and cold-treated groups were displayed in figure 2d. genes with fold change ≥  <dig>  p-value <  <dig>  and q-value <  <dig>  were considered to be differentially expressed. the numbers of up- and down-regulated genes after cold exposure were  <dig>  and  <dig> . genes regulated by cold stress were listed in additional file  <dig>  genes such as il12a  and sp8b  were found to be specifically expressed in cold-treated larvae. genes ptgr <dig> , irg1l  and mmp13a  were among the most highly up-regulated genes under cold stress, while mep1b , rh <dig>  and nr5a <dig>  were representative genes inhibited by cold stress. a comparison with our previous study  <cit>  revealed a significant overlap between the up-regulated genes detected by microarray and rna-seq . since larvae exposed to cold stress for different time periods were used in these studies, considerable discrepancy in gene expression was also found.

validation of rna-seq data by quantitative real time pcr 
to validate the expression profiles from rna-seq analysis, relative mrna levels for  <dig> genes were measured by qpcr. the expression data for these genes and transcript isoforms detected by rna-seq and qpcr are displayed in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  expression of these genes and transcripts except cry-dash, were confirmed by qpcr. the down-regulation of per <dig> upon cold stress was detected by probes targeting per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig>  in our previous microarray study  <cit> . however, rna-seq explicitly revealed the down-regulation of per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig> and the up-regulation of per3-j <dig>  in this study. the data from qpcr and rna-seq exhibited excellent agreement on both up- and down-regulated genes. the correlation between microarray and qpcr data was analyzed by spearman’s rho test and a highly statistical significance  was observed.

gene ontology  enrichment analysis of genes regulated by cold stress
go enrichment analysis was performed to reveal the biological processes overrepresented under cold stress. as shown in figure  <dig>  five main functional categories including rna metabolic process, cellular component biogenesis, regulation of metabolic process, catabolic process and rna localization were significantly enriched from genes up-regulated by cold stress. more specific terms of these enriched categories include rna splicing, ribosome biogenesis and protein catabolic process .

the most specific go terms overrepresented by cold-inhibited genes include oxidation-reduction process, fatty acid biosynthetic process, proteolysis, sterol biosynthetic process, ammonium transmembrane transport, oligopeptide transport, organic cation transport and chitin catabolic process . genes associated with the enriched go terms were shown in additional file  <dig>  some of these enriched go terms from this study such as rna processing, ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process and proteolysis were previously found to be overrepresented in cold-regulated genes  <cit> . the results of go enrichment analysis indicate that multiple biological processes are involved in the establishment of cold resistance in zebrafish larvae.

kegg pathway enrichment analysis of genes regulated by cold stress
the results of kegg pathway enrichment analysis were displayed in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> pathways were overrepresented in genes up-regulated by cold stress. spliceosome was the most significantly enriched pathway, in which  <dig> %  of the associated genes were up-regulated by cold stress. the components of spliceosome include the u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig>  u <dig> and u <dig> small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles , each of which consists of a specific small nuclear rna , a common set of seven sm/lsm proteins and variable number of particle-specific proteins  <cit> . we found that the sm/lsm genes and nearly all others associated with u <dig>  u4/u <dig> and u <dig> were up-regulated by cold stress . some of the cold-induced genes have been shown to play essential roles in splicing. for example, u <dig> specific splicing factors sf3a  and sf3b  are involved in stabilizing the u2/bs  duplex  <cit> , and members of the dexd/h-box family of rna unwindases/rnpases such as brr <dig> , prp <dig>  and prp <dig>  are responsible for driving rearrangements of the spliceosome’s rna-rna and rna-protein networks required for splicing  <cit> . in addition, some genes involved in the non-snrnps complexes such as prp <dig> complex were up-regulated by cold stress as well .

ribosome biogenesis in eukaryotes is another highly represented pathway with  <dig> %  of the associated genes up-regulated by cold stress . the process of ribosome biogenesis involves the maturation of ribosomal rrnas and their assembly into ribosomal subunits  <cit> . among the multiple steps during the ribosomal subunit biogenesis, cold-induced genes mainly function in the rrna modification process. the 2′-o-methylation and pseudouridylation are the most prevalent modifications of rrnas. the modified nucleotides are important for the conformation and stabilization of rna and the activity of ribosome in translation  <cit> . among the cold-induced genes associated with ribosome biogenesis, nop <dig> , nop <dig> , nop <dig>  and snu <dig>  are associated with 2′-o-methylation. dkc <dig> , nhp <dig>  and gar <dig>  are related to pseudouridylation of rrnas. utp <dig> , utp <dig> , utp <dig>  and nan <dig>  are building blocks of the t-utp complex, which is required for the subsequent assembly of other 90s pre-ribosome components  <cit> . additionally, genes associated with other 90s pre-ribosome components and the maturation of 40s and 60s subunits were up-regulated by cold stress .

other representative pathways regulated by cold stress include rna transport, pyrimidine metabolism, rna polymerase, purine metabolism, mrna surveillance pathway, herpes simplex infection, protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum and circadian rhythm. moreover, many pathways involved in signal transduction such as mapk signaling, p <dig> signaling, erbb signaling, wnt signaling and mtor signaling pathways were enriched from cold-induced genes. furthermore, pathways associated with cell communication such as tight junction and gap junction were overrepresented in cold-induced genes. these findings indicate the importance of signal transduction and cell communication in the acclimation of zebrafish larvae to cold stress.

pathways overrepresented by cold-inhibited genes include steroid biosynthesis, peroxisome, drug metabolism, amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, inositol phosphate metabolism, cardiac muscle contraction . since most of these pathways are associated with metabolism, cold stress appears to suppress the basal metabolism of zebrafish larvae.

differential splicing under cold stress
in addition to differentially expressed genes, cuffdiff can identify genes with differential splicing and promoter switching under different conditions  <cit> . a total of  <dig> genes were found to be differentially spliced in zebrafish larvae after exposure to cold stress . results of functional clustering reveal that these differentially spliced genes are classified into eight functional clusters in which regulation of transcription is the most highly represented biological process . the expression of stk <dig>  was characterized as an example of posttranscriptional regulation induced by cold stress. zebrafish stk <dig> gene is located on chromosome  <dig>  which can generate one transcript as predicted in ensembl . this transcript encodes a peptide of  <dig> amino acids . cufflincks assembled a new transcript  lacking the second exon in stk16-j <dig> and the coverage of all other exons was markedly increased in cold-treated samples when compared to the controls . the results of differential expression analysis revealed that stk16-j <dig> was specifically expressed in larvae exposed to cold stress . rt-pcr analysis confirmed the specificity of stk16-j <dig> in cold-treated samples . the skipping of exon  <dig> led to a truncated peptide lacking the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids .

alternative promoter usage under cold stress
when a gene is transcribed from multiple transcription start sites  due to the alternative usage of promoters, cuffdiff will allocate them into different tss groups by adding up the expression levels of isoforms, which reflect the promoter preference between conditions  <cit> . in this study, putative promoter switching was found in  <dig> genes under cold stress . among these genes, zebrafish per <dig> gave rise to three transcripts including per3-j <dig>  per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig> . per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig> share the same tss  and open reading frame, while per3-j <dig> uses a different tss  to generate a short transcript . the expression level of per3-j <dig> was significantly induced, but those of per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig> were inhibited by cold stress . moreover, the per3-j <dig> became the dominant transcript under cold stress, indicating per3-p <dig> is a cold- preferred promoter . the up-regulation of per3-p <dig> under cold stress was further validated by qpcr analysis .

since zebrafish per <dig> was reported to be a circadian gene  <cit> , we further characterized the expression pattern of per <dig> transcripts during a 24 h light–dark cycle. zebrafish larvae were kept under light–dark cycle from fertilization and exposed to 16°c from  <dig> hpf to  <dig> hpf. as shown in additional file  <dig>  the overall expression of per3-p <dig> transcripts under 28°c peaked at 12:00 am and dropped to trough at 12:00 pm; however, when exposed to cold stress the level of per3-p <dig> transcripts decreased at first and peaked at 8:00 pm. the level of per3-j <dig> was very low and no diurnal expression patterns were found in control larvae maintained at 28°c. upon cold exposure, the expression level of per3-j <dig> continuously increased and the peak was found at 8:00 pm . these results indicate that cold stress can lead to the alteration in the circadian rhythm of longer per <dig> transcripts per3-j <dig> and per3-j <dig>  and induce the shorter transcript per3-j <dig> showing no diurnal expression patterns under normal temperature.

discussion
it has been suggested that genetic background, thermal history and developmental stages are the most important factors determining the cold-tolerance of fish  <cit> . most of the previous studies of cold acclimation in fish have focused on long-term and especially seasonal adaptive responses in juveniles or adults. it was recently shown that the thermal experience of fish at embryonic stages can have dramatic and persistent effects on thermal acclimation capacity of adults  <cit> . however, the adaptive responses of fish larvae to cold stress and the transcriptional alterations during these processes remain largely unknown. in this study, we demonstrated that exposure of  <dig> hpf zebrafish larvae to 16°c for 24 h led to a significant increase in survival rates of developing larvae under further severe cold stress at 12°c, indicating that zebrafish larvae possess a rch-like ability to build cold-tolerance under mild low temperature. to our knowledge, this is the first evidence indicating the existence of rch-like responses in fish. in insects, the elevated body levels of low molecular cryoprotectants such as glucose, trehalose and glycerol were suggested to be the biochemical basis of the rch  <cit> . in fishes, increases in the ratio of unsaturated fatty acids and plasma lactate concentration  <cit> , up-regulated mitochondria biogenesis  <cit> , biosynthesis of isoenzymes  <cit>  and regulation of muscle fiber types  <cit>  were found to be associated with long-term cold acclimation. to further address the molecular mechanisms underlying the establishment of cold-tolerance in fish larvae, we investigated the transcriptional responses during the establishment of cold-tolerance using rna-seq. a total of  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes were identified in  <dig> expressed genes of zebrafish larvae. these differentially expressed genes are involved in many crucial processes and pathways such as rna splicing, protein catabolic process, ribosome biogenesis, spliceosome, proteosome and ribosome biogenesis. additionally, the alternative splicing of  <dig> genes and promoter switching of  <dig> genes were found to be specifically regulated by cold stress. obviously, findings of the study are of great importance for further investigation of the cold-specific signaling networks in fish.

previous studies have shown that a very large number of genes are involved in the acclimation of fish to cold stress. a systematic microarray study of carp tissues exposed to low temperature for 22 days identified  <dig> cold-regulated cdnas  <cit> . many of cold-induced genes were found to be regulated by both short- and long-term cold stress. representatives of these genes include cold-inducible rna binding protein , high-mobility group proteins , ribonucleoproteins involved in mrna processing and splicing  and translation initiation factors . thus, these genes can be used as potential molecular markers for characterization of the cold acclimation responses in different fish species. moreover, many of the highly overrepresented functional categories and pathways of cold-induced genes from this study are overlapped with those found in all the analyzed tissues of carp exposed to cold stress  <cit> , indicating the importance of these processes or pathways in the establishment of cold-tolerance. since rna processing and ribosome biogenesis processes are directly associated with gene expression, the alterations of these biological processes are consistent with the notion that more up-regulated genes are usually found than down-regulated genes in transcriptomic analysis of fishes exposed to cold stress  <cit> . furthermore, protein catabolic processes such as the ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolism were often found to be induced by cold exposure, suggesting the degradation and modification of unfolded or misfolded proteins under low temperature stress.

the sensing and intracellular transduction of stress signals is critical for the adaptation and survival of organisms under various environmental stresses. information about the mechanisms whereby fish cells sense the cold signal and trigger the intracellular responses is extremely scarce. in this study, mitogen-activated protein kinase , p <dig> and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor  signaling were found to be the most highly enriched signal transduction pathways under cold stress. the canonical mapk signaling pathway is a three-component signal cascade in which an activated mapk kinase kinase  activates a mapk kinase , which then activates an extracellular signal-regulated kinase mapk or erk  <cit> . it has been shown that mapk pathway is involved in intracellular responses to diverse environmental stresses including cold, heat, reactive oxygen species, uv, desiccation and pathogen attack  <cit> . the p <dig> signaling pathway can be induced by stress signals such as dna damage, hypoxia, heat and oxidative stress and its activation often leads to cell cycle arrest, cellular senescence or apoptosis  <cit> . the ppar signaling pathway is mainly involved in the protection of cells against oxidative stress and apoptosis  <cit> . overrepresentation of these signaling pathways among cold-induced genes suggests their importance in the transduction of cold signals and the establishment of cold-tolerance in fish. since protein phosphorylation is extensively involved in the activation of these signaling pathways, characterizing the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins upon cold stress would provide further insights into the networks for sensing and transduction of cold signal.

alternative splicing events such as exon skipping, alternative usage of 5′/3′ splice sites and intron retention may lead to changes of the amino- or carboxy-terminus, in-frame addition/removal of a functional unit and insertion of premature termination codon, thus contributing to both transcriptomic and proteomic diversities  <cit> . accumulating evidence indicates that alternative splicing is important for adaptation responses to a wide range of stress conditions  <cit> . stress-associated alternative splicing is mainly described for genes encoding the protein kinases, transcription factors, splicing regulators and pathogen-resistance factors, and the alternative splicing under stress conditions usually leads to changes in the subcellular localization, binding properties, and activity or stability of the resulting proteins  <cit> . in this study, alternative splicing of  <dig> genes and promoter switching of  <dig> genes were found to be regulated by cold stress. the generation of a short stk <dig> splicing isoform under cold stress was selected for validation of transcriptome analysis. it is known that stk <dig> functions as a transcriptional co-activator in the expression regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor   <cit> . however, the functional significance of alternative splicing of zebrafish stk <dig> under cold stress remains unclear. moreover, promoter switching was confirmed by molecular analysis of per <dig> transcripts and a short isoform containing  <dig> exons was found to be highly up-regulated under cold stress. it has been demonstrated that per <dig> is involved in multiple processes such as circadian rhythm, sleep, cancer, cell proliferation and apotosis  <cit> . further investigations are needed to reveal the functions of cold-specific splicing variants and transcripts in the cold acclimation of zebrafish.

nearly all eukaryotic cells possess self-sustained circadian clocks that couple endogenous biochemical, physiological and behavioral rhythms with environmental changes  <cit> . the effects of temperature on circadian clocks have been well established. except for day/night cycles, temperature changes serve as a zeitgeber for circadian clocks and temperature cycles of as little as 2°c are sufficient to entrain the clock  <cit> . temperature changes in physiological range can influence the amplitude of circadian transcriptional rhythms but not alter the period length of circadian cycles   <cit> . out of the range of temperature compensation, the clock stops running and arrests at a certain phase  <cit> . in plants, cold-responsive pathways and cold tolerance are intimately associated with circadian clocks  <cit> . in zebrafish, many core clock genes such as nuclear receptors , period homologs  and cryptochromes  were induced by cold stress , suggesting the involvement of circadian clocks in cold acclimation. furthermore, we identified a shorter isoform of per <dig> gene highly up-regulated by cold stress . this short isoform lacks the functional pas  domain and the period circadian-like c-terminal domain and is similar to a small interference peptide , which serves as a dominant-negative to interfere the activities of corresponding transcription factors in plants under cold stress  <cit> . further investigations are needed to address if the cold-specific transcription of per <dig> is related to temperature compensation of circadian clock and cold acclimation in zebrafish.

cells adapt to stresses or changing environmental conditions as a result of alterations in gene expression at multiple levels including transcriptional, post-transcriptional and translational regulations  <cit> . although a large number of genes were found to be up-regulated at transcriptional level upon cold stress, the correlation between gene transcription and the proteomic landscape remains to be characterized. the activity of proteins is dependent on their correct folding and only correctly folded proteins have the long-term stability in crowded biological environments and are able to interact selectively with their natural partners  <cit> . the folding of proteins is a temperature-dependent process and the hydrophobic effect driving protein folding decreases with dropping temperature  <cit> ; therefore, the folding rate of proteins decreases at reduced temperature  <cit> . the landscape of protein folding in living cells can affect gene expression at transcriptional level, so the up-regulated mrna level of some genes and alternative splicing events under cold stress could be a compensating measure for the reduced protein folding rate. further investigations are needed to address the correlation between cold stress-induced transcriptomic and proteomic responses in fish.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has revealed the existence of cold acclimation in zebrafish larvae. further transcriptomic analysis has uncovered many cold-regulated genes encoding proteins that are key components of some crucial biological processes and signaling pathways such as rna splicing, ribosome eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, protein catabolism, spliceosome, proteasome and rna transport. additionally, a large number of alternative splicing and promoter switching events were identified to be specifically regulated during the establishment of cold acclimation in zebrafish. these findings have provided novel clues for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the cold acclimation in zebrafish.
