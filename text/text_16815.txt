BACKGROUND
a wealth of molecular data concerning the linear structure of proteins and nucleic acids is available in the form of dna, rna and protein sequences. multiple sequence alignment has become an essential and widely used tool for understanding the structure and function of these molecules. the results of annotation of gene/protein sequences, prediction of protein structures or building of phylogenetic trees, for instance, are critically dependent on the quality of the given alignment. it has been recognized that the automatic construction of a multiple sequence alignment for a set of remotely related sequences can be a very demanding task. therefore, there is a need for an objective approach to evaluate the alignments produced by alignment programs.

two popular measures for scoring entire multiple alignments are the sum of pairs  score and the column score   <cit> . these scores can, however, only be used if a reference alignment of the same sequences is available. the sp score calculates the proportion of identically aligned residue pairs in the test and the reference alignments, whereas the cs score measures the fraction of identically aligned positions. several modifications have been made to the sp score  <cit> . the apdb  quality measure evaluates the quality of an alignment by using available tertiary structures of the sequences in the alignment  <cit> . the recently introduced multiple overlap score  is a promising approach, which does not need a reference alignment  <cit> . the mos searches for identically aligned regions in many alignments and presumes that the alignment with the highest number of such residues also has the highest quality.

we introduce a statistical alignment quality score which first quantifies the degree of conservation at each alignment position and then counts the number of significantly conserved positions over the alignment. for measuring the degree of conservation, we use a type of z-score that is based on profile analysis  <cit> . after deriving the maximum z-score for positional conservation, the statistical significance of an observed score value is estimated using the importance sampling method  <cit> . the full alignment quality score is defined in terms of positional significance levels, where the multiple comparison problem is addressed with false discovery rates   <cit> . the practical performance of the maxz score is demonstrated using the sh <dig> domain, ras-like proteins, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase families. the alignment quality score is finally applied to evaluate the alignment programs clustal  <cit> , tcoffee  <cit> , dialign <dig>  <cit> , probcons  <cit> , muscle  <cit> , and mafft  <cit> .

related work
several approaches have been proposed for the conservation analysis of multiple sequence alignments to quantify the degree of conservation at each aligned position using column-specific score values  <cit> . valdar reviewed a wide range of such score types developed during the last two decades for protein sequence analysis  <cit> . he also introduced the following three criteria that a positional conservation score should fulfill:  the score should be a mathematical mapping from an alignment position into a bounded interval of real values which  takes into account the relative symbol frequencies in the column, and  their stereo-chemical properties. additional requirements for a good conservation score include the possibility to incorporate  the effect of gaps and  sequence weighting into  a simple scoring strategy.

existing positional scoring approaches can be roughly divided into two categories with respect to the second and third criteria. in the first category, the positional conservation is characterized based on the symbol frequencies only. such frequency-based methods include, for instance, the information-content score that quantify the variability among the observed symbols at a particular position by means of shannon's entropy  <cit> . a popular variation of the information-content  score measures the kullback-leibler distance  between the observed symbol distribution and a background distribution of a priori symbol probabilities  <cit> . the background probability of an individual symbol may be calculated from the complete alignment, possibly supplemented with symbol-dependent pseudo-counts  <cit> . alternatively, a priori distribution can be determined using overall relative frequencies of symbols within the sequences of the organism or protein family under investigation.

in the second category of scoring approaches, the positional conservation is characterized based on both symbol frequencies and their similarity properties. such similarity-based scores address the fact that some symbol combinations occur more frequently than others mainly because of the chemical and physical properties. the most straightforward strategy is to group all the symbols according to their physicochemical properties before applying a particular scoring scheme. for instance, taylor presented a classification of amino acids based on their synthesis in the dayhoff mutation data matrix  <cit> . subsequently, the degree of positional conservation with respect to each overlapping group of symbols can be quantified using any frequency-based scoring approach, such as the information content  <cit> . different conservation scores accounting for the stereochemical sensitivity can be obtained using different symbol properties  <cit> .

in general, the symbol properties can be considered by predefining an appropriate matrix where entries represent the similarity or dissimilarity between a symbol pair. frequently used symbol scoring matrices for amino acids include the blosum and gonnet series of substitution matrices and pam distance matrices  <cit> . perhaps the most widely used scoring approach, 'sum-of-pairs', characterizes the positional conservation by calculating the sum of all pairwise similarities between the symbols in the particular column  <cit> . it should be noted, that this 'sum of pairs' score is different from the sp score mentioned earlier in the background section. the sp score in  <cit>  is used to measure alignment quality with respect to the reference alignment, whereas the score by carillo and lipman  <cit>  is more generally applicable. in this work, we only use the reference alignment-based sp score. a similar but more complex mean distance  score is used as an objective function in the multiple alignment software clustal  <cit> . this normalized md score also considers the fraction of gaps  <cit> . a number of variations can be made by using different similarity matrices on symbols or weighting schemes on sequences  <cit> .

the present work is a continuation of our previous work on a statistical  framework for detecting conserved residues in the positions of a multiple sequence alignment  <cit> . here, we allow for the incorporation of any symbol similarity matrix into the framework that was based on simple frequency-based scoring function. we have previously demonstrated the usefulness of this score in the automatic detection of the conserved residues in a multiple sequence alignment, and compared its results on the sh <dig> domain with functionally and structurally important positions of the alignment  <cit> . another application of the conservation scores includes the improvement of the reliability of hmms in the sequence similarity search by decreasing the number of false positive search results  <cit> . in the present study, the emphasis is on positional conservation rather than on individual residues with the aim of assessing the quality of full alignment.

RESULTS
evaluating the maxz score for positional conservation
in this section, we study the practical performance of the maxz score in sh <dig> domain, ras-like proteins, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase familes. we first demonstrate the effect of five different scoring matrices and then we compare the performance of maxz score with those of information content  and mean distance  score  <cit> . finally, we demonstrate how the maxz score can be used to generate a consensus sequence.

multiple sequence alignments
we used the multiple sequence alignments of the sh <dig> domains, ras-like proteins, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase families to evaluate the maxz score. the alignments for the sh <dig> domain, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase families were obtained from the pfam database  <cit> . the seed alignments of the sh <dig> domain, peptidase m <dig>  subtilases and β-lactamases consist of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences, respectively. these alignments also include gaps. the sequence alignment of the ras-like proteins was downloaded from the web page of an article by oliveira et al.  <cit> . the alignment was build with a two-step alignment procedure  <cit> . first they classified sequences into groups with approximately 90% pairwise sequence identity. sequences within each subgroup were aligned against the profile, then the groups were aligned, excluding positions with low sequence identity. the positions with gaps were also excluded from the final alignment. we used only the first sequence of each subgroup in order to avoid over-representation of profiles with many very similar sequences. this was necessary because the current maxz score does not take the pairwise identity of the sequences into account or otherwise weight the sequences. the alignment of ras-like proteins consists of  <dig> sequences.

upper panels of the figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> illustrate parts of the alignments of the ras-like proteins, sh <dig> domain, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase families. the complete alignments of the ras-like proteins and sh <dig> domain can be found as additional files . the figures were generated using multidisp graphics program developed to visualize multiple sequence alignments  <cit>  . the lower parts of the alignments include the maxz, md and ic score values. the blosum <dig> and grouping of amino acids were used as a scoring matrix in the maxz score.

effect of the scoring matrices
one advantage of the maxz score is that it can consider the physicochemical relationships of amino acids. the user is able to choose an arbitrary scoring matrix or classification of the amino acids, which can be incorporated into the calculation of the maxz score. in addition to the identity matrix, we demonstrate the use of three different scoring matrices: blosum <dig>  gonnet <dig> and pam <dig>  <cit> . additionally, we classify amino acids into six physicochemically related groups as follows: hydrophobic {v, i, l, f, m, w, y, c}, negatively charged {d, e}, positively charged {r, k}, conformational {g, p }, polar {n, q, s} and {a, t}. this classification has been used, for example, by shen and vihinen  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows the scaled -log-values for the ras-like proteins using the five different scoring schemata.

the residue positions in the alignment of ras-like proteins were divided into five groups according to the entropy and variability  <cit> . the parameter values of the classification algorithm were chosen such that the groups represent the known structural and/or functional roles of the residue positions. a rough overview of the categories is the following:

• box  <dig> contains positions with low entropy and variability. the positions in this group form a main functional site.

• box  <dig> consists of positions with low variability and moderate entropy. these positions are located in the core of the structure next to the residues in box  <dig> 

• box  <dig> contains positions with moderate entropy and variability. these residue positions are located in the core structure but are not adjacent to the residues in the box  <dig>  the positions are involved in the structure of the protein, but also in signal transmission between the modulators and the main functional site.

• box  <dig> consists of the positions with high entropy and moderate variability. these positions are located at the surface or in the core of the protein and are involved in modulator interaction.

• box  <dig> contains highly variable positions with high entropy. these positions are mainly located at the surface of the protein.

for a more detailed description of the categories, see the original paper  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the median  values of the -log-values of the maxz scores with different scoring matrices, along with md and ic scores in each of the five groups. as expected, all conservation scores decreased gradually when moving from the positions with low entropy and variability to those with high entropy and variability. the performance of the md and maxz scores was very similar. the maxz score with groups of amino acids distinguished slightly better than the other scores the moderately conserved positions  from the highly conserved positions  and unconserved ones  .

in both ras-like protein and sh <dig> domain examples, all the scoring schemes tend to provide very similar results . the results with blosum, gonnet and pam matrices all rely heavily on the diagonal values of the scoring matrices. for instance, a position with highly or moderately conserved leucine obtains a relatively low maxz score , whereas a position with an unconserved cysteine may be also assigned as highly conserved. this is especially critical when the gonnet scoring matrix is used. the results with six amino acid groups differed most from the other scoring schemes since this calculates the maxz score for the amino acid classes instead of single residues. the grouping of amino acids tends to give high scores for the positions where the majority of the residues belong to the same class. the use of the identity matrix corresponds to the special case where similarities among the symbols are ignored, and the amino acids are handled as if they where unrelated. the corresponding score is thus based solely on the relative frequencies of the residues and background probabilities. the scoring based on the identity matrix shows quite similar results with the blosum <dig> and gonnet matrices. for some positions, however, the identity matrix fails to detect the conserved positions. similar behavior was seen with the pam matrix .

box <dig> and box <dig> represent positions with low and high entropy and variability, respectively. the three middle columns represent the moderately conserved positions. more detailed description of the categories can be found in oliveira et al.  <cit> .

comparisons with other scores
the results of the maxz score were compared with those of the md and ic. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the md and ic scores together with the -log-values of the maxz scores for the sh <dig> domain, peptidase m <dig>  subtilase and β-lactamase family sequences. scaling of the -log-values was performed using zero as a minimum. the maximum value was obtained by calculating the -log-values for each possible invariant position and defining the 5% percentile value to be the maximum. blosum <dig> was used as a scoring matrix in the maxz score. the default multiple sequence alignment parameters of clustalx were used to calculate the md score.

sh <dig> domain sh <dig> domains are binding modules recognizing phosphotyrosines and surrounding residues in polypeptides and proteins  <cit> . many sh <dig> domains recognize especially residues + <dig> and + <dig> following the phosphotyrosine and form binding pockets for these amino acids  <cit> . all known sh <dig> domains share the same architecture, consisting of a central antiparallel β-sheet flanked by two α-helices. the central β-sheet  forms the core of the structure and includes most of the conserved residues.

all scores consider the positions forming the binding pocket as highly conserved . these include invariant βb <dig>  which interacts with phosphotyrosine, and βd <dig> and αa <dig> , which form the binding pocket for the phosphotyrosine  <cit>  . position βd <dig>  which is also involved in forming the binding pocket, obtains lower conservation score values  indicating moderate conservation. the binding pockets for phosphotyrosine-following residues are formed by the αb-helix, especially positions αb <dig> –  <dig> are involved in forming the hydrophobic core for residue + <dig>  <cit> . positions βb <dig>  αb <dig> and βf <dig> are occupied with aromatic residues. the maxz and ic scores determine these five positions as highly conserved, whereas the md score  determines positions αb <dig>  and βf <dig> as moderately conserved . the binding site for ligand residue + <dig> includes positions βd <dig> and βd <dig>  <cit> . while the maxz and ic scores determine position βd <dig> as moderately conserved, the md score  rather considers that position as unconserved .

peptidase family m <dig> peptidase family m <dig>  also known as neprilysin family, consists of type ii integral transmembrane proteins with short n-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane region, and a large ectodomain containing a active site  <cit> . three conserved motifs characterize all known m <dig> endopeptidases : i:0vnafy <dig>  ii:63xxhexxh- -xx <dig>  iii:147exxxd <dig> . additionally iv:217hxxxxxr <dig> is conserved in neprilysins .

all measures scored as highly conserved the residues h <dig>  h <dig>  e <dig> which are ligands for zn2+, and e <dig> and h <dig>  which are involved in catalysis . the maxz score values varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> in the invariant positions occupied with different amino acids, whereas the corresponding md score values were more stable. this was due to different diagonal values of the scoring matrix. the similar behavior was found in the position  <dig> of the motif iv, where proline was the most frequent residue. the maxz score determined that position as highly conserved , whereas the other scores only considered it as moderately conserved . for the other important side-chains of n <dig>  a <dig>  d <dig>  h <dig> and r <dig>  which have a role in substrate binding, the behavior of the three scores was mostly very similar . the only exception was the position d <dig>  which was considered as moderately conserved by the maxz and ic scores , while the md score considered it as unconserved. another difference between the scores was in the positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the motif ii, where the ic score could not determine these positions as inserts, but obtained considerably high conservation score values.

subtilisins pfam subtilase is a family of serine proteases consisting of s <dig> and s <dig> peptidase families of the merops database. the s <dig> peptidases are divided into two subfamilies: s8a  and s8b . the sequences in the s <dig> family have a catalytic triad asp/his/ser. in the subfamily s8a, the active site residues occur  in the motifs i:28d-t/sg <dig>  ii:254hgth <dig> and iii:687gtsmaxp <dig>  and in the subfamily s8b in the motifs i:28d-dg <dig>  ii:254hgtr <dig>  iii:687gtsa/va/sxp <dig> .

all positions of the catalytic triad asp/his/ser were considered as highly conserved by each of the conservation scores. in the first motif, the maxz and md scores obtained high conservation score values  for the aspartic acid and glycine residues . the middle position had three possible side-chains in the first motif, and hence, all scores determined that position as moderately conserved . in the second motif, there were more differences between the conservation scores: the maxz score determined all the positions as highly conserved , the md score determined the first three positions as highly conserved , whereas the fourth position obtained much lower score  . the ic score determined only the first position as highly conserved , whereas the other positions obtained a slightly lower  conservation score values. hence, only the maxz score considered the whole motif as highly conserved. the md score, on the contrary, obtained rather low conservation score values for the position  <dig>  where subgroups s8a and s8b are conserved in different amino acids. the third motif was a good example of the behavior of the different scores in the invariant positions . while the md score obtained the highest score value  <dig> in all the invariant positions, the maxz and ic scores were dependent on the side-chain. nevertheless, the maxz score determined all the invariant positions as highly conserved , whereas the ic score obtained somewhat lower scorings .

β-lactamases β-lactamase family of pfam contains sequences from many different groups including d-alanyl-d-alanine carboxypeptidase b, aminopeptidase, alkaline d-peptidase, animal d-ala-d-ala carboxypeptidase homologues, the class a and c β-lactamases and eukaryotic β-lactamase homologs. the family is very diverse outside the sxxk motif, s being the active side residue. for the sequences belonging to the s <dig> peptidase  family in the merops database, the active site motif is i:120sxtk <dig>  it also has another motif: ii:306yxn <dig> .

all the scores determined the active site serine residue as highly conserved and provided a very similar conservation profile for the first motif . in the second motif, the maxz and ic score correctly determined the highly conserved position  <dig> with tyrosine/serine residues and considered the other residues as moderately conserved, while the md score, on the contrary, failed to detect the highly conserved position  <dig>  where it gave only  <dig>  as a score value for that position .

these results on the example families suggest that there are three main differences between the maxz, md and ic conservation scores. firstly, since the maxz score is strongly affected by the diagonal value of the scoring matrix used, it obtains slightly lower values for the positions occupied with very frequently occurring amino acids and slightly higher value for more rarely occurring amino acids than the other scores. for very frequently occurring amino acids, see for example position αb <dig> of the sh <dig> domain  with highly conserved leucine or positions iii:g <dig> and iii:s <dig> of the subtilase family , which obtain a much lower maxz than md score. in the opposite case, at positions αb <dig> –  <dig> of the sh <dig> domain, the high diagonal values of the scoring matrix for histidine and tryptophan offer a much more reliable scoring than the md score . similarly, the result of the maxz score for the position 11: <dig> of the β-lactamase family indicates that the position may be functionally important, whereas the result of the mc score indicates the contrary . the maxz score also determines different values for invariant positions with different amino acids, whereas md score always gives the score of  <dig> for invariant positions. secondly, as the maxz score is entirely determined by the residue obtaining the greatest z-score value, it is not affected by the other residues whose proportions may be very low, but a single conserved residue can already define a position as conserved . hence, the maxz score may find important positions of the alignment, which were not found by the other scores. thirdly, the maxz and md scores also consider gaps resulting in zero or very low scores for the insert positions of the alignment. the ic score, on the other hand, fails to detect the insert positions.

taken together, all three scores behaved in a rather similar manner. the ic score does not take into account gaps, and thus its use is relevant only when the alignment does not include gaps. the maxz and md scores differ in some positions, which generally depend on the similarity matrix or grouping used with the maxz score. for the ras-like proteins, the maxz score with groups of amino acids distinguishes slightly better than the other scores both the moderately conserved positions  from the highly conserved positions  and unconserved ones . however, the results of table  <dig> cannot be used to evaluate the ic score since entropy was used in the classification. for the sh <dig> domains, on the one hand, the maxz score determines the positions forming the binding pocket for the phosphotyrosine and surrounding molecules mostly as highly conserved, but on the other hand, it also correctly determines the more variable loops between the α-helices and β-stands as unconserved. the md and ic scores also perform well, but sometimes the md score fails to detect the important positions, and the ic score is not capable in detecting the loops between the conserved structures.

consensus sequence
as a by-product, the maxz score also produces the consensus sequence for the multiple sequence alignment. according to formula , the consensus residue at each alignment position is defined as the residue with the greatest z-score value. the legend of figure  <dig> shows the consensus sequence for the part of the sh <dig> domain.

evaluating the aq score for alignment quality
in this section, we evaluate the output of the alignment programs using alignment quality  based on the maxz score and compare it to the sum of pairs  and the column score  quality scores  <cit> . first, we study the relationship between the individual aq and sp scores. then we compare the quality scores of  <dig> alignment methods using balibase database  <cit> . since the divergence from the reference values was substantially constant over different false discovery rate  values, the results are presented at fdr =  <dig> .

comparison of individual aq and sp scores
we build  <dig> test alignments for each set of sequences in the balibase database and compared the results of the aq and sp scores. figure  <dig> shows the scatterplot between the aq and sp scores for the mafft alignments  in different reference sets. the spearman rank correlation coefficient between the aq and sp scores was  <dig>  for the l-ins-i alignments. the range of the correlation coefficient in the  <dig> alignments was from  <dig>  to  <dig> . figure  <dig> shows a clear relationship between the quality scores. the three of the four outlying alignments on the lower right corner of figure  <dig> are from the reference set  <dig>  in these alignments, the sp scores also dramatically differed from the column score values .

alignment quality assessment
we compared the performance of the  <dig> alignment programs using five reference sets of the balibase database. the first two reference sets of the balibase include equi-distant sequences whose identity is less than 20%  or between  <dig> and 40% . according to the aq score, the results on the reference set  <dig> indicate that probcons was the best method aligning on the average 80% of the conserved residues correctly . the l-ins-i strategy of mafft and muscle also performed well obtaining quality scores only 5–7% lower than that of the probcons. in the reference set  <dig>  all the tested programs performed rather well . the probcons, muscle, l-ins-i and tcoffee obtained the highest alignment quality score values . these methods did not differ from each other, but they differed from all the other methods . the quality score was the worst in the alignments produced by dialign, clustal, or fft-ns- <dig> strategy of mafft showing 41–54%  and 12–16%  divergence from the reference alignment. the result of the sp score was very similar. the only relevant difference was the probcons showing significant difference to the other programs in the both reference sets  <dig> and  <dig>  even if the absolute difference between the methods was very low: the sp score of the probcons and l-ins-i, for instance, differed from each other only 2%. the absolute cs scores were in all programs approximately 20%  and 10%  lower than that of the aq and sp scores. in the reference set  <dig>  the probcons differed significantly from the other methods. in the reference set  <dig>  the probcons showed significant difference from all the other programs except the l-ins-i.

the aim of the reference set  <dig> is to test the ability of programs to align the sequence families having disrupted by an "orphan" sequence. the reference set  <dig> consists of subgroups of sequences whose residue identities between the subgroups are less than 25%. according to the aq and sp measures, the quality of all alignments was very high in the reference sets  <dig> and  <dig> . in the reference set  <dig>  the median scores varied from 87% to 96% and from 92% to 97% in the aq and sp scorings, respectively, whereas the cs score obtained clearly lower scores varying from 39% to 62%. in the reference set  <dig>  the overall sp  and especially cp scoring  was somewhat lower than that of the aq scoring . in the aq scoring, the l-ins-i and clustal were slightly better than the other methods aligning 96/98%  of the conserved residues correctly. the muscle and tcoffee scored almost as well and did not differ significantly from the l-ins-i and clustal . in the reference set  <dig>  additionally, the fft-ns- <dig> and probcons did not differ from the best scoring methods. the dialign obtained clearly the lowest quality scores , and differed significantly from the other methods. in the reference set  <dig>  the sp scoring of the probcons showed significantly better performance than the other programs. the sp scores of the four best programs: probcons, l-ins-i, tcoffee and muscle, were, however, within the  <dig> % range from each other. another difference between the aq and the other scores was that while with the aq scoring the clustal  was among the four top methods and the probcons  was the second worst method, with the sp and cs scoring the probcons obtained the best results  and the clustal  was the second worse method differing significantly from the better scoring methods .

the programs have no statistically significant differences between each other in the particular set. statistical analyses were performed using wilcoxon signed rank test.

the reference set  <dig> contains sequences with n/c-terminal extensions. in this reference set, the median aq and sp scores varied from 85% to 94% and the median cp score from 49% to 68%. the l-ins-i obtained the best aq scores aligning 94% of the conserved residues correctly . the differences between the l-ins-i and the other methods, except the tcoffee, were statistically significant . the performance of the three quality scores were very similar; the only difference was that with the sp and cs scorings the quality of the probcons alignments were comparable with the quality of the l-ins-i and tcoffee alignments.

in the last reference set, the alignment includes sequences with internal insertions. in this reference set, the l-ins-i and tcoffee obtained approximately  <dig> to 6% better results than the other methods aligning more than 91% of the conserved residues correctly when the aq scoring was used . the differences were, however, statistically significant only with respect to the dialign . according to the sp score, the tcoffee, probcons and l-ins-i differentiated between the lower scoring methods fft-ns- <dig>  muscle, dialign and clustal, even if the differences in the median values were very low. in the cp score, the result was similar to that of the sp score. the only difference was the muscle, which ranked among the four best programs.

to summarize, in the balibase database the l-ins-i, probcons, muscle, tcoffee and clustal all produced alignments with very high quality, whereas the fft-ns- <dig> and dialign performed generally worse than the other methods. the overall best method was the l-ins-i which was among the significantly best methods in all six reference sets . the probcons performed best in the reference sets  <dig> and  <dig>  whereas in the other sets, the l-ins-i was the best scoring method. in the sp score, the probcons differed significantly from the other methods in the reference sets 11– <dig> and was among the best scoring methods in all reference sets. the cs score results in much lower values than the other scores, but the ranking of the methods was very near to that of the sp score. in both scores, the probcons, l-ins-, tcoffee and in some references muscle produced the best alignments, whereas the clustal, fft-ns- <dig> and dialign performed worse.

discussion
in this paper, we have introduced a novel approach to objective alignment quality scoring. unlike most of the existing methods, the proposed aq score is not heuristic but is based on statistical theory. the score is mathematically motivated and its asymptotic properties are well known. the aq score does not handle all alignment positions equally but concentrates on conserved positions only. in the present work, the aq score is calculated with respect to the reference alignment. the future aim is to use the conserved alignment positions without the reference alignment. the proportion of conserved residues consaa can be used to assess the quality of the alignments also when the reference alignment is not available. our preliminary results show a strong correlation between the predicted and reference alignment based aq score values .

the proposed scoring method is based on integrating the statistical hypotheses testing methods into the profile analysis framework. the attraction of profile analysis lies in the convenient treatment of the symbol frequency vector, which allows not only the incorporation of any classification or symbol similarity matrix but also the possibility to consider the influence of gaps and weights in a very simple manner  <cit> . hence a score based on profile analysis immediately fulfills the six criteria set as requirements of a good conservation score by valdar  <cit> . a drawback of the current maxz score is that the sequence weighting is not taken into consideration. weighting the profiles with an appropriate value would allow the evolutionary relationships of the sequences in the multiple sequence alignment to be considered.

the aq score is based on comparing the number of conserved alignment positions between the test and the reference alignments, as assessed with the maxz score, so that the dependency between the alignment positions is also considered. the multiple comparison problem is handled by using false discovery rate when choosing the conserved positions. to estimate the significance of the observed maxz scores, we used the is method. in genetics applications, the is method has previously been successfully applied to the binomial distribution  <cit> . the application of the is method to multinomial distribution is, however, not a trivial task because the parameter space is multidimensional. we used a mixture distribution as a sampling distribution for the multinomial distribution. with the help of simulations, we sought for the appropriate parameter values of the mixture distribution and approximated the number of the samples needed for the proper estimation of the significance values .

in addition to developing an alignment quality scoring framework, our second objective was to test the alignment quality of commonly used multiple sequences alignment programs. we evaluated the quality of  <dig> alignment methods. the overall performance of the l-ins-i strategy of mafft was the best. the probcons worked best with groups of equi-distant sequences having residue identity less than 20%  or 20–40% . the l-ins-i and clustal performed best with the reference set that consists of families aligned with a highly divergent "orphan" sequence  or groups of equi-distant distantly related sequences . the l-ins-i and tcoffee worked best when the sequences contained n/c-terminal extensions  or internal insertions . it should be noted, however, that the differences between the most of the alignment methods were negligible; in addition to the l-ins-i, also the probcons, muscle, tcoffee and clustal produced alignments with very high quality. the dialign and fft-ns- <dig> strategy of mafft, on the contrary, performed clearly worse than the other methods. the comparison between the mafft and muscle was potentially biased because the muscle was run using default settings. running the muscle with the most accurate options would probably have affected the results.

we evaluated the quality of the alignment software using the balibase  <dig> database. previous studies using the balibase database have been performed for the database version  <dig>  <cit> . the drawback of that database is that some of the reference alignments consist of a few sequences only. in the version  <dig>  the reference sets have more sequences and therefore the current database suits better for statistical scoring of the alignment quality. the results are rather similar to those obtained in the previous studies using the sp or cp scores or modified versions of them  <cit> . in our study, the performance of mafft is better than reported earlier. this is because the previous results have been obtained using the nw-ns-i strategy, whereas we used the l-ins-i, the most accurate strategy of mafft at the moment . another difference was in the performance of probcons: do et al.  <cit>  showed that in the reference sets 20– <dig>  probcons outperformed the other methods, while with our aq scoring, the performance of the probcons was poorer than that of the l-ins-i and tcoffee.

CONCLUSIONS
we have presented a statistical approach to alignment quality scoring. the quality is characterized on the basis of conserved position information only, which is defined by using the modified z score in conjunction with the profile analysis framework. the significance tests based on the importance sampling method define the conserved positions and false discovery rate correct the error caused by multiple testing. the final aq score accounts for the residue frequency over the conserved alignment positions.

we have compared the aq scores of the  <dig> alignment methods using the balibase as a benchmarking database. the results indicates that even if the l-ins-i obtained the best overall result, there are no great differences between the best scoring alignment methods: l-ins-i, probcons, muscle, tcoffee and clustal whereas the fft-ns- <dig> and dialign usually scored worse. the comparison of the aq and sp scores gave similar results indicating that the aq score is a reliable method for assessing the quality of the multiple sequence alignments.
