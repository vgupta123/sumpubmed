BACKGROUND
the yabby  family of transcription factors regulates various aspects of vegetative and floral development in flowering plants. first identified in arabidopsis, yabs have a characteristic structure that includes an n-terminal zinc finger domain and a c-terminal yabby domain containing a helix-loop-helix motif similar to that found in the high mobility group  of proteins  <cit> . analysis of the zinc finger domain has shown that it mediates homo- and heterodimerization between the yabs, as well as interactions with other proteins  <cit> . in contrast, the yabby domain is associated with non-specific dna-binding  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis distinguishes five sub-families of yabs in the angiosperms, represented by the filamentous flower/yabby <dig> , yab <dig>  yab <dig>  crabs claw  and inner no outer  clades. in eudicots such as arabidopsis, the so-called vegetative yabs - fil, yab <dig>  yab <dig> and yab <dig> - are expressed in the abaxial domain of developing leaf and floral organ primordia  <cit> , whereas crc is restricted to the developing carpel and nectaries, and ino is expressed specifically in the outer integument of the ovule  <cit> . characterisation of the vegetative yabs through mutant and gain-of-function analyses has shown that they regulate cell identity in developing organs and thus play an important role in establishing organ polarity and subsequent lamina growth  <cit> . this regulation is complex, however, as loss of fil and yab <dig> activities is associated with the partial adaxialisation of organs  <cit> , whereas combined loss of fil, yab <dig> and yab <dig> results in organ abaxialisation  <cit> . similar observations have been made in antirrhinum, where mutations in the fil/yab <dig> ortholog, gram, are associated with a loss of abaxial cell identity, whereas when combined with mutations in the yab <dig> ortholog, prolongata , they result in a loss of adaxial cell identity  <cit> . yabs fit into a highly complex and redundant network of transcription factors and small rnas that promote organ polarity . factors that promote adaxial identity include the as <dig>  arp and the class iii homeodomain-leucine zipper  transcription factors, as well as the trans-acting small interfering rnas generated by the mir390-tas3-rdr <dig> pathway  <cit> . in contrast, the kanadi  and auxin response factor /arf <dig> and arf4) classes of transcription factors promote abaxial identity, together with the micrornas mir165/ <dig> <cit> . the precise position of yabs within these networks is not certain, but based on yab loss-of-function phenotypes it has been proposed that yabs integrate adaxial-abaxial patterning with a program of lamina growth  <cit> .

in addition to promoting lamina growth, vegetative yabs also prevent shoot apical meristem  regulators from being expressed in the developing leaf primordia. in the absence of vegetative yab activity, knox and wuschel  expression is detected in leaves, where it is associated with the formation of sam-like structures  <cit> . yabs also play a significant role in regulating sam activity, as the inflorescence meristem of fil mutants is noticeably enlarged and displays aberrant phyllotaxy  <cit> . in addition, these meristem defects are associated with laterally expanded expression of the meristem regulators wus and clavata <dig>   <cit> . major disruptions in sam size and organisation, culminating in sam arrest, are also observed in higher order arabidopsis and antirrhinum yab mutants  <cit> . this aspect of yab function is apparently conserved in angiosperms as a recent study has shown that tongari-boushi <dig>  a fil-like yab from rice, controls floret meristem activity  <cit> . as yab accumulation in both arabidopsis and antirrhinum is limited to the abaxial domain of developing lateral organs and floral primordia  <cit> , their sam-promoting activity presumably reflects non-cell-autonomous activity  <cit> .

recent studies have begun to address how yabs function at a molecular level. for instance, physical and genetic interactions between the vegetative yabs and the co-repressors leunig  and the closely related leunig_homolog  suggest that yabs act in repressive complexes  <cit> . lug and luh share structural and functional similarity with tup <dig>  groucho  and tle co-repressors that are present in yeast, drosophila and vertebrates  <cit> . given this similarity, it is likely that lug and luh display a similar range of interactions with dna-binding factors as that described for fungal and animal co-repressors. in this regard it is interesting to note that in yeast, some dna-binding proteins are capable of functioning as activators when not associated with a repressor complex  <cit> . several recent studies have also identified plant transcription factors with dual activities, behaving as either activators or repressors on different sets of target genes  <cit>  or in different tissues  <cit> . this raises the intriguing possibility that some dna-binding proteins associated with gro-like co-repressors may also possess bifunctional activity. in this study, we test this possibility by examining the regulatory properties of the vegetative yabs. we show, using a combination of transient transactivation assays and genome-wide transcriptomic analysis, that fil and possibly yab <dig> function as activators during vegetative development. consistent with the biological importance of activation activity, fusing the repressive motif srdx to fil results in a dominant negative phenotype when expressed in plants. based on transcriptomic analysis, several polarity regulators were identified as fil targets. significantly, two of these target genes, kan <dig> and arf <dig> are thought to lie upstream of the yabs. we therefore propose a model in which yab proteins maintain leaf polarity by establishing a positively reinforcing feedback loop following the emergence of adaxial/abaxial patterning.

RESULTS
fil and fil-like yabs function as activators in yeast
we previously used the yeast two-hybrid assay to examine physical interactions between the yabs and various components of the lug co-repressor complex. in testing yab constructs for autoactivation, we discovered that yeast expressing the gal <dig> dna binding domain  fused to fil produced a noticeable colour change after 4 h growth on media containing x-α-gal . interestingly, this property is not shared with the closely related yab <dig> or with other vegetatively expressed yabs  . to determine whether activation is a conserved feature of the fil subgroup of yabs, we examined whether the antirrhinum fil ortholog, gram, behaves as an activator in yeast. for comparison, we also tested the yab <dig> ortholog prol and the yab <dig> ortholog amyab <dig>  when grown on media containing x-α-gal, yeast lines expressing bd:gram produced a colour change after 16 h, whereas no colour change was detected with either bd:prol or bd:amyab <dig>  while the behaviour of yab proteins in yeast does not necessarily reflect their activity in the plant, these results nonetheless raised the intriguing possibility that the fil subgroup of yabs function as activators.

in planta assays indicate that fil/yab <dig> can function as transcriptional activators
to further investigate the properties of the arabidopsis yabs, we used an in vivo plant transcription assay to determine whether the vegetatively expressed yabs  function as activators. yabs were translationally fused to gal <dig> bd  and introduced into arabidopsis leaves along with the luciferase reporter uas::luc. following transfection, proteins were extracted from leaf tissue and assayed for luciferase activity. we first established a baseline level of luciferase activity by assaying extracts from leaves transfected with 35spro::bd, and then found that a construct expressing bd fused to the gal <dig> activation domain  produced a  <dig>  fold increase in luciferase activity. while bd:yab <dig> and bd:yab <dig> constructs produced no more than baseline luciferase activity, bd:fil and bd:yab <dig> both activated the uas::luc reporter, resulting in a  <dig> -fold increase in luciferase activity . these results not only confirm that fil functions as an activator in plants, but extend this function to the closely related yab <dig> protein.

genome-wide transcript profiling following fil activation
to identify genes that are positively regulated by fil during shoot development, we opted to assay genome-wide changes in the arabidopsis transcriptome following rapid induction of fil activity. lines expressing an inducible form of fil  were generated by fusing fil to the ligand-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor . in the absence of the synthetic hormone dexamethasone , these lines were phenotypically normal, but when grown on media with dex, or sprayed with dex, they produced downward curling epinastic leaves that accumulated high levels of anthocyanin . these characteristics are similar to those reported for 35spro::fil lines displaying an intermediate over-expression phenotype . moreover, induction of fil activity was also associated with leaf abaxialisation, as the adaxial epidermal pavement cells of dex-treated 35spro::fil:gr leaves had an abaxial morphology, appearing smaller and more irregularly shaped than cells of mock treated leaves . abaxialisation was subsequently confirmed when gus activity derived from the yab3- <dig> allele, a gene trap that produces abaxially-restricted gus activity  <cit> , was detected in the adaxial domain of leaves of dex-grown yab3-2/35spro::fil:gr plants . activation of fil:gr also completely suppressed the formation of narrow or needle-like leaves of the yab triple mutants when activated in this background .

having shown that the fil:gr fusion is biologically indistinguishable from fil, we assessed transcriptional changes in the shoots of ten-day-old plants following activation of fil:gr. as plants were grown under short-day conditions, shoot tissue consisted of mature cotyledons, hypocotyl, and approximately four fully emerged leaves at various stages of development. these included leaves undergoing leaf blade expansion , as well as leaves that had only just emerged from the shoot. although not visible, initiating organ primordia were also part of these samples. rna was extracted from this tissue following exposure to dex or a mock treatment, and used to probe affymetrix ath <dig> genome microarrays. each treatment consisted of four biological replicates with expression being sampled at 4 h and 8 h post-dex induction. following normalization of the expression data and comparisons between mock and dex treated samples, differentially expressed genes were ranked according to their fold change in expression. we considered a gene differentially expressed if there was a  <dig>  fold or greater change in expression following dex treatment, and if this expression difference was associated with a  <dig>  or smaller q-value . the 4 h dataset included  <dig> up-regulated genes and  <dig> down-regulated genes, while the 8 h dataset had  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes. of these,  <dig> genes  were present in both datasets and thus represent a group of genes that consistently respond to fil activation over an 8 h time period . a second group of genes were differentially expressed at 8 h but were not present in the 4 h dataset . because group a represents genes with robust and consistent responses to fil activation, we primarily focused on this group.

the close match between the number of group a genes showing reduced expression and the number showing elevated expression following dex treatment suggested that fil functions as both an activator and a repressor. to determine whether these two functions are associated with different biological processes, we used gene ontology analysis to identify terms that are enriched in the up- and down-regulated gene sets. down-regulated genes were enriched for go terms associated with growth processes  and responses to auxin , whereas up-regulated genes were enriched for terms associated with metabolic processes , responses to stimuli including abiotic stress , biotic agents  and chemicals , as well as multi-cellular organismal processes  involved in lateral root formation. based on this analysis, it appears likely that fil regulates distinct processes by functioning as an activator in some cases and as a repressor in others.

previous work has established that yabs promote organ polarity, and ectopic fil expression is associated with the partial abaxialisation of leaves . consistent with this function, we found that two well-defined abaxial-promoting regulators, kan <dig> and arf <dig>  are elevated ~2-fold following fil:gr activation . surprisingly, ett/arf <dig>  a gene that functions redundantly with arf <dig> in promoting abaxial cell fate  <cit> , and other kan family members associated with abaxial patterning  were not found in either group a or b. this suggests that fil activates some, but not all cell polarity regulators.

validation of microarray data
to verify our microarray data, expression of selected group a genes in 35spro::fil:gr shoot tissue exposed to dex or a mock dex treatment for 4 h was assessed by quantitative rt-pcr. included in this group were genes associated with polarity regulation  as well as genes associated with auxin , ethylene responses  and anthocyanin regulation . with the exception of nac <dig>  all of the genes displayed a statistically significant change in expression following dex application, which corroborated the microarray data . as microarray analysis was performed 4 h after dex treatment, it is likely that many of the differentially expressed genes are direct downstream targets of fil. this was tested by examining responsiveness of selected fil-target genes to dex induction in the presence of the translational inhibitor cycloheximide . using an inducible transactivation system, where gus activity is controlled by a dex-inducible synthetic transcription factor gr-lhg <dig> , we showed that combined exposure to chx and dex was sufficient to suppress gus activity . having established the effectiveness of chx treatments, we next examined the transcriptional responses of twelve group a genes  and one up-regulated group b gene following combined dex/chx exposure. seven of these genes showed a statistically significant change in expression following these treatments and were thus considered direct fil targets .

a complicating factor in our analysis is that fil:gr expression is not confined to the abaxial domain, and thus transcriptional changes induced by fil activation may not reflect the normal behaviour of the endogenous protein. to address this, we generated a filpro::fil:gr line in which inducible fil activity is limited to the abaxial domain of developing leaves. growing this line on media with dex did not result in a yab over-expression phenotype, although some leaf epinasty was apparent . we next used qrt-pcr to assess the transcriptional response of five positively regulated fil-response genes in the filpro::fil:gr line following a 4 h dex treatment. all five genes responded positively to induction, although statistically significant elevation was only apparent for three of these: arf <dig>  sina and as <dig> . despite the limited nature of this survey, the observed similarity in transcriptional response between the 35spro::fil:gr and filpro::fil:gr lines suggests that many of the fil-response genes identified in our study are indeed immediate targets of fil.

to confirm that members of the kan family  and the arf4-related gene ett/arf <dig> did not respond to fil activation, we used qrt-pcr to assay their expression in the 35spro::fil:gr line following a 4 h dex treatment. consistent with the microarray experiment, this analysis failed to detect significant changes in the expression of these genes . we next considered whether the fil paralog yab <dig> regulated arf <dig>  kan <dig> and as <dig>  to test this possibility, we generated an inducible yab <dig> line  and showed that growth on media containing dex induced a yab over-expression phenotype . qrt-pcr revealed significant elevation of arf <dig>  kan <dig> and as <dig> following dex treatments, but not of ett/arf <dig>  kan <dig> or kan <dig> . this analysis not only indicates that fil and yab <dig> regulate the same target genes, which is consistent with the observed redundancy between these close paralogs  <cit> , but that there is also a high degree of specificity in this regulation, as related family members do not respond to yab induction.

analysis of fil-regulated polarity regulators in mutant lines
our data indicated that fil, and possibly other vegetative yabs, regulate arf <dig>  kan <dig> and as <dig> during vegetative development. to test this possibility further, we analysed the expression of these genes in shoot tissue derived from 28-day-old fil mutants, as well as from mutant combinations containing a progressively reduced complement of active vegetative yab genes . a complicating factor in this analysis is the observed abaxialisation of yab triple and quadruple mutants  <cit> , which would be expected to cause elevated expression of abaxial polarity regulators. consistent with this, we found that both arf <dig> and kan <dig> expression was elevated in triple yab mutants, with arf <dig> expression remaining high in the quadruple mutants . unlike arf <dig>  kan <dig> expression was significantly reduced in quadruple mutants, suggesting that kan <dig> is regulated directly and positively by the yabs. as <dig> expression remained unchanged in the multiple yab mutant lines , with the exception of fil yab <dig> mutants, in which it showed a slight increase. while this analysis clearly demonstrates the predominant role of yabs in regulating kan <dig>  regulation of arf <dig> and as <dig> presumably involves other factors that function redundantly with the yabs.

our expression studies suggested the possibility that ectopic expression of the polarity regulators kan <dig> and arf <dig> following fil:gr activation may be the cause of the polarity defects observed in the 35spro::fil:gr line when continuously exposed to dex. to test this, kan <dig> and arf <dig> mutations were introduced sequentially or together into the 35spro::fil:gr background and their phenotype assessed following continuous exposure to dex. lines receiving dex treatment displayed the same leaf epinastic and adaxialisation phenotype as that of 35spro::fil:gr lines . this suggests that the abaxialisation phenotype associated with constitutive yab activity is the result of multiple factors being ectopically expressed during leaf development.

expression of fil:srdx induces yab loss-of-function phenotypes
the erf-associated amphiphilic repressor motif  has been used to convert positively-acting transcription factors into dominant repressors. thus, to address the importance of transcriptional activation for yab function, we investigated the effects of constitutive fil:srdx expression in plants. before performing these experiments, we confirmed that the srdx motif suppressed fil activation by showing that a fil:srdx fusion was incapable of activating the luciferase reporter in plant-based transactivation assays .

to compare the effects of constitutive fil:srdx expression to that of fil, plants were transformed with either a 35spro::fil:srdx or 35spro::fil construct. while fifty-five 35spro::fil primary transformants were recovered following basta treatment, the same selection yielded only a single 35spro::fil:srdx transformant. this plant had a wild type appearance, suggesting that the fil:srdx transgene was unlikely to be active in this line. given the failure to isolate significant numbers of transgenic plants, we assumed that embryonic or early seedling activity of the fil:srdx transgene was likely to be associated with lethality. to circumvent this problem, we used the gr:lhg4/pop transactivation system to drive post-embryonic expression of fil transgenes . growth of 35sproi> > fil lines in the presence of dex produced the same epinastic cotyledon phenotype as 35s::fil:gr lines exposed to dex , although subsequent leaf development exhibited weaker phenotypes, even when the dex concentration was doubled . in contrast, the early stage of 35sproi> > fil:srdx growth on media with dex was characterised by the development of narrow, upwardly curling, hyponastic cotyledons and leaves . the fact that this phenotype differs from the one associated with constitutive fil expression is consistent with fil:srdx no longer functioning as an activator.

in contrast to previous experiments using srdx fusions  <cit> , the presence of this motif was not sufficient to induce a strong loss-of-function phenotype in 35sproi> > fil:srdx lines. this could be due to levels of fil:srdx not being sufficiently high to interfere with the activity of the native fil/yab <dig> proteins. to address this, we introduced a filpro::fil:srdx construct into yab <dig> mutants that were heterozygous for the fil mutation  and analysed the phenotype of transgenic fil yab <dig> mutants in the subsequent generation. as a control for these experiments, we first showed that filpro::fil complemented the fil yab <dig> mutant phenotype . none of the filpro::fil:srdx lines complemented the fil yab <dig> phenotype, instead, the majority  had cotyledons that were noticeably smaller than those of fil yab <dig> mutants and, like fil yab <dig> yab <dig>  displayed frequent bifurcations . leaves arising in over half of the fil yab3/filpro::fil:srdx lines  were similar in appearance to fil yab <dig> yab <dig> mutant leaves in being radial and extremely short . presence of yab3:gus activity throughout the developing leaves of these lines indicated that these organs were partially or fully abaxialised . in lines where this abaxialisation phenotype was most prevalent , transgenic fil/+ yab <dig> sibs also had a fil yab <dig> leaf phenotype , which is consistent with fil:srdx acting dominantly to suppress native fil activity.

analysis of leaf epidermal cell morphology confirmed that filpro::fil complemented the polarity defects of fil yab <dig> mutants, as abaxial cells displayed a wildtype morphology . in contrast, fil/+ yab3/filpro::fil:srdx cells were larger and less irregular than wildtype abaxial cells and similar in appearance to the partially adaxialised cells of fil yab <dig> mutants . indeed, sem analysis of fil yab3/filpro::fil:srdx needle-like leaves revealed a mixture of oblong and jigsaw-shaped cells; exactly the same cellular morphology observed in fil yab <dig> yab <dig> triple mutant leaves . in summary, these experiments show that inverting the transcriptional activity of fil through fusions to srdx leads to a strong yab loss-of-function phenotype when expressed in plants lacking native fil/yab <dig> activity. a plausible explanation for this phenotype is that the fil:srdx protein functions dominantly by preventing yab <dig> and yab <dig> from activating their targets. this experiment therefore provides the first direct evidence that yabs function as activators during the early stages of leaf development.

discussion
based on earlier work showing physical and genetic interactions with members of the plant gro-like family of transcriptional co-repressors, we proposed that yabs function as transcriptional repressors  <cit> . however, genetic analysis indicates that yabs perform their functions independently of these co-repressors. for instance, the conspicuous loss of adaxial cell identity characteristic of yab triple or quadruple mutants is not seen in lines lacking co-repressor activity, nor when single or double yab mutants are combined with mutations in the lug and luh co-repressors  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the regulatory activity of the vegetative yabs and found that, in yeast-based transcriptional and in plant transactivational assays, fil functions as an activator. this property is likely shared with the closely related yab <dig> protein, but seemingly not with yab <dig> and yab <dig>  analysis of the ovule specific yab, ino, indicates that this factor also functions as an activator, although in this case only autoregulation was investigated  <cit> . this conclusion was based on the observation that abundance of ino transcripts and activity of an ino promoter:reporter construct are reduced in strong ino mutants.

direct evidence for fil functioning as an activator also comes from our microarray analysis, where changes in gene expression were assessed 4 h and 8 h following dex-induced activation. of the response genes identified, approximately half were under positive regulation, whereas the remainder were under negative regulation. subsequent qrt-pcr analysis incorporating chx treatments confirmed that half of the genes tested were indeed likely to be direct fil-targets. an increasingly common way to establish whether a transcription factor functions as an activator is to convert it into a repressor through a fusion to the srdx motif, and then show that this chimeric protein produces a dominant negative phenotype when expressed in planta. while fil:srdx expression in wildtype plants did not generate yab loss-of-function leaf phenotypes, prominent leaf patterning and growth defects were observed in a fil yab <dig> mutant background. this suggests that native fil and yab <dig> proteins suppress the repressive activity of fil:srdx, perhaps through competition for target binding sites, as fil and yab <dig> are both expressed at high levels in the abaxial domain of developing leaves. in the absence of competing fil/yab <dig>  fil:srdx constitutively represses genes normally activated by the remaining vegetative yabs. this implies that all four vegetative yabs function as activators during the early stages of leaf development. while this is consistent with the observed functional redundancy between members of the yab family  <cit> , our analysis did not reveal activation activity associated with either yab <dig> or yab <dig> . this may reflect the relative insensitivity of our yeast and transactivation assays or, alternatively, a requirement for yab-interacting proteins that function as activators.

transcription factors that act as both activators and repressors have been reported in animals  <cit>  and several examples are also known in plants. for instance, the meristem-regulator wuschel activates agamous  expression in the floral meristem  <cit> , but represses the a-type arabidopsis response regulator <dig>  in the shoot apical meristem  <cit> . extensive functional characterisation has confirmed the dual nature of wus, as well as showing that this activity applies to many more genes  <cit> . bifunctional activity is also a feature of the senescence-related wrky <dig> factor, which acts as an activator or repressor according to sequences surrounding the wrky-binding motif  present in the promoters of target genes  <cit> . on the basis of our results, we propose a model in which yabs are bifunctional, acting either as activators or, when associated with lug and luh, as repressors .

a novel aspect of our study is the finding that the abaxial polarity regulators kan <dig> and arf <dig> are likely to be immediate fil targets. this is supported by the observed increase in kan <dig> and arf <dig> expression in 35spro::fil:gr plants following combined dex/chx treatment. furthermore, finding reduced kan <dig> expression in yab quadruple mutants indicates that kan <dig> regulation is a feature common to the other vegetative yabs. in contrast to kan <dig>  arf <dig> expression was elevated in all yab mutant backgrounds examined. this finding was surprising, given that fil acts positively on arf <dig>  previous studies of yab mutants have established that in addition to leaf patterning defects, these lines lack stipules, display retarded growth and have defects in meristem activity  <cit> . yab mutants also display defects in auxin-regulated processes, such as vascular patterning and formation of the leaf margin, and have reduced activity of the auxin-responsive reporter dr <dig> <cit> . given this, it is possible that increased arf <dig> expression observed in yab mutants is a consequence of pleiotropy, and that this obscures the role played by yabs in regulating arf <dig> 

the observation that fil regulates kan <dig> and arf <dig> is also surprising given that previous studies have placed the yabs downstream of such regulators. for instance, fil expression occurs after the establishment of adaxial-abaxial patterning in developing lateral organ primordia  <cit> , which itself depends on antagonistic interactions between the c <dig> hd-zips and kan genes  <cit> . thus, kan activity is likely to precede that of the yabs, a hierarchy that is further supported by the observed reduction of fil/yab <dig> expression in developing leaves of kan double and triple mutants  <cit> . similarly, arf <dig> and the related ett/arf <dig> gene are thought to function upstream of the yabs  <cit> . our findings can be reconciled with yabs functioning downstream of these abaxial regulators if it is assumed that fil functions after the establishment of adaxial-abaxial patterning. such a scenario is attractive, as activating kan <dig> and arf <dig> following organ patterning would generate a positive feedback loop that maintains abaxial identity . an important test of this model is to determine whether expression of kans and c <dig> hd-zips is initially polarized in the organ primordia of yab quadruple mutants. this could be addressed using live cell imaging to monitor the dynamics of kan and c <dig> hd-zip expression during the early stages of lateral organ development. another aspect of our model is the role played by the lug-yab regulatory complex in the early patterning of the leaf. while our microarray analysis did not identify any known adaxial regulators that are negatively regulated by fil, previous studies have shown that lug mutants enhance the adaxialisation phenotype of fil yab <dig> mutant leaves  <cit> . we therefore propose that the lug-yab regulatory complex is involved in the repression of adaxial regulators, although whether this is mediated by direct or indirect regulation remains to be determined. what is currently missing from this model is an understanding of the temporal-spatial distribution of each of these transcriptional activities. for instance, can repression and activation occur in the same cell, or are they spatially separated activities? determining the expression pattern of positively and negatively regulated yab-target genes within the developing leaf may help resolve these issues. additionally, establishing the precise distribution of the lug-yab complex within cells of the developing leaf will also provide insight into the likely transcriptional activities of vegetative yabs. while technically challenging, this could be achieved using in planta bret measurements  <cit> .

the activation of kan <dig>  arf <dig> and as <dig> by fil and yab <dig> has recently been integrated into a computational-derived model of sepal patterning  <cit> . with the exception of as <dig>  the inclusion of these regulatory relationships produced a coherent model with other known patterning pathways. the inconsistency with as <dig> regulation concerns the apparent restriction of as <dig> expression to the adaxial domain of the developing sepal where fil presumably does not act. however, closer inspection of as <dig> expression domain in sepals revealed that this overlapped with fil during the early stages of organ formation. thus, fil regulation of as <dig> could also be incorporated into this model, if it is assumed that there are also adaxial factors that promote as <dig> expression and abaxial factors that repress as <dig> expression during the later stages of sepal development  <cit> .

auxin distribution is affected in yab loss-of-function mutants, leading to disruptions in the marginal region of developing leaves, as well as the formation of multiple cotyledons during embryogenesis  <cit> . how yabs regulate auxin distribution in the developing leaf blade is not well understood, but may reflect roles in auxin biosynthesis, movement or signalling. our study confirms the link between the yabs and auxin responses, as many of the genes responding to fil activation have go terms associated with either auxin responses or biosynthesis. in addition we show that arf <dig> and arf <dig> are positively regulated by fil and may thus influence the sensitivity of leaf cells to auxin. it is, however, unlikely that the auxin-associated defects of yab mutants are due to reduced activity of arf <dig>  as arf <dig> expression was elevated in triple and quadruple yab mutants, presumably as a result of abaxialisation that is associated with the loss of vegetative yab activity. instead, we propose that yabs mediate auxin signalling either through direct association with arfs, or more likely as part of a regulatory complex. supporting this possibility is evidence that some arfs interact with components of the lug regulatory complex  and hence may be indirectly associated with the yabs that are also part of these complexes.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that fil is a bifunctional transcription factor that acts either as an activator or as a repressor. our finding that the conversion of fil into an obligate repressor resulted in yab loss-of-function phenotypes when expressed in plants provides direct evidence that activation is required for leaf patterning. consistent with this finding, fil is likely to function as a direct activator of the abaxial-promoting factors kan <dig> and arf <dig>  as well is adaxial regulator as <dig>  on the basis of these results, it is proposed that fil generates positive feedback loops that maintain adaxial-abaxial polarity following initial polarization of the leaf primordium. this study has therefore provided important new insights into yab function, as well as laying the foundations for future studies aimed at understanding these enigmatic transcription factors.
