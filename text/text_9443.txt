BACKGROUND
the first  <dig> weeks of postnatal life in mouse is a period of intense growth, with body weight increasing 7- <dig> fold, half of which is accounted for by the increase in skeletal muscle  <cit> . postnatal muscle growth is achieved by an increase in number  and size  of myofibres in rat  <cit> , but mainly by hypertrophy of myofibres in mouse  <cit> . the extensor digitorum longus  muscle of the crural hind limb has been well studied. in rat edl, there is an increase in myonuclei until at least  <dig> days of age  <cit> . in mouse however, the edl achieves its full complement of myofibres between embryonic day   <dig> and birth  <cit> . there is a lack of information about myonuclei accretion in the early postnatal period, but little addition of myonuclei from postnatal day   <dig> onwards has been reported, although the mouse edl increases rapidly in size from this point; with a  <dig>  fold increase in weight between 2- <dig> weeks of age  <cit> .

the new myonuclei required during postnatal muscle growth are provided by muscle satellite cells  <cit> , which occupy a distinct niche on the surface of the myofibre, beneath the surrounding basal lamina  <cit> . cells in this location can first be identified in foetal mouse muscle around e <dig> , after the formation of the basal lamina  <cit> . at birth, muscle satellite cells have been reported to comprise 30-35% of sublaminal nuclei in mouse peroneus longus muscle, and 28% of sublaminal nuclei in mouse lumbrical muscle at p <dig>  <cit> . many of these satellite cells  are proliferating in both growing mouse and rat  <cit>  and labelling of dna-synthesis is greatest before p <dig> in mouse, after which it declines sharply  <cit> . the majority of satellite cells become mitotically quiescent in mature muscle  <cit>  with only <1% still incorporating label during cell division in  <dig> to  <dig> week old mice  <cit> . the proportion of satellite cells also gradually falls as growth proceeds  <cit> , for example dropping from 11% at p <dig> in mouse edl to 3% at  <dig> weeks of age, with absolute numbers also falling by a similar amount  <cit> . thus most satellite cells are dividing to provide new myonuclei during postnatal growth, before a population of uniformly mitotically quiescent satellite cells is established.

there is however, a lack of data in mouse from the first two postnatal weeks, effectively missing, what studies suggest, to be the most dynamic period of postnatal growth. by using isolated myofibres from genetically modified mice  <cit>  at different ages, it is possible to track changes in myofibre dimensions, and relate this to the number of myonuclei and satellite cells. for this study, we chose to examine the edl as it is possible to remove it intact from relatively young postnatal mice to section or prepare myofibres from. it has a near uniform fast fibre type composition in adult, with <1% slow fibres  <cit> , and this relative distribution of fast and slow fibres is established early, and does not change during postnatal growth  <cit> , reducing any impact of fibre type differences on myonuclear or satellite cell number  <cit> . in addition, it has been the subject of similar studies in the past e.g. ontell et al.  <cit> .

here, we report that total myofibre number in edl remained unchanged between p <dig> and p <dig>  while myofibre cross-sectional area increased by  <dig> -fold and length by  <dig> -fold, resulting in an expansion in myofibre volume of  <dig> -fold. using two independent mouse models, we found that myonuclear accretion in edl myofibres occurred only within the first three weeks postnatally, with a  <dig> -fold increase between p <dig> and p <dig>  the number of satellite cells was initially similar to the daily rate of myonuclear addition, with ~ <dig> satellite cells per myofibre until p <dig>  when the calculated mean myonuclear accretion rate is  <dig>  nuclei per day. between p <dig> and  <dig>  the addition of myonuclei decreased to  <dig>  nuclei per day, while the available satellite cells fell from ~ <dig>  to ~ <dig>  per myofibre. despite the addition of new myonuclei, the greater proportional increase in myofibre volume meant that the myonuclear domain doubled between p <dig> and p <dig> to an estimated  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig>  the adult number of myonuclei and satellite cells is established by three weeks of postnatal development. thus the calculated mean myofibre volume increases 3-fold between p <dig> and p <dig> , without the net addition of new myonuclei, resulting in a further significant expansion of the myonuclear domain in fast myofibres, to an estimated  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> 

RESULTS
total myofibre number does not change during postnatal growth of edl muscle
muscle growth can be achieved by an increase in myofibre number and/or an expansion of individual myofibres. to first examine if hyperplasia of the edl contributed to muscle growth during the postnatal period in mouse, we counted the number of myofibres contained in the mid-belly section of muscles dissected from p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig>  mice on haematoxylin and eosin stained , or laminin-immunostained, cryosections . this analysis showed that there was no change in edl myofibre number between p <dig> and p <dig>  .

myofibres and satellite cells  were counted per cross section at mid-belly level, and cross-sectional area was measured from at least  <dig> myofibres, from each of three myf5nlacz/+ mice at each age. data shown are mean ± sem . asterisk indicates significant difference from preceding value .

myofibre dimensions increase significantly during postnatal edl growth
to assess myofibre hypertrophy, we first determined cross-sectional area of myofibres from mid-belly muscle sections of edl between p <dig> and p <dig> . we found that cross-sectional area increased significantly at each time-point analysed  in a linear manner , from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> at p <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm <dig> at p <dig> .

data are mean ± sem  from  <dig> × 3f-nlacz-e mice per age for length measurements and at least  <dig> each of myf5nlacz/+ and 3f-nlacz-e mice per age for myonuclear and satellite cells counts. for sarcomere length, data are mean ± sem  from three mice at each age. asterisk indicates significant difference from preceding value .

to determine the length of muscle fibres, we used collagenase digestion to isolate viable myofibres from edl muscles of 3f-nlacz-e mice at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> . individual intact myofibres were fixed and measured and we found that the mean length increased from  <dig> ±  <dig> μm at p <dig>  to  <dig> ±  <dig> μm at p <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> μm by p <dig> . adulthood was considered reached by p <dig>  at which time the mean myofibre length was  <dig> ±  <dig> μm, an approximate  <dig> -fold increase from p <dig> . myofibre elongation over this period was logarithmic . to examine if changes in myofibre length were influenced by the relaxation state at different ages, we also measured sarcomere length of isolated myofibres at p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> . sarcomere lengths were close to reported figures of living mouse edl myofibres , but importantly, were not significantly different between the ages examined .

myonuclear accretion in edl myofibres is complete by p21
to determine both the rate of myonuclear addition and the point at which the myofibre attains its full adult complement of myonuclei, we used two complementary mouse models. the 3f-nlacz-e mouse  <cit>  contains a transgene in which elements of the myosin light chain 3f locus drive a nlacz reporter gene in all fast muscle myonuclei . the myf5nlacz/+ mouse  <cit>  has β-galactosidase activity in satellite cells from the nlacz-targeted myf <dig> allele  <cit> , allowing the number of myonuclei to be determined by counting dapi-positive/β-galactosidase-negative nuclei . intact isolated myofibres were fixed in paraformaldehyde, incubated in x-gal and mounted with dapi. the number of myonuclei per myofibre at p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig>  and p <dig> counted in these two independent mouse models was not significantly different at each age , and so the data were combined . we did not formally analyse the distribution of myonuclei along the length of a myofibre, but they appeared to be uniformly distributed at all ages examined .

analysis of myonuclei per muscle fibre between p <dig> and p <dig>  revealed that edl myofibre growth goes through distinct phases. during the first two postnatal weeks, myofibres accumulate  <dig>  nuclei per day , with the mean myonuclear capacity of edl myofibres undergoing two complete doublings between p <dig>  and p <dig> . indeed they reach ~81% of the adult myonuclear number by p <dig>  from just ~20% at p <dig> . in the third postnatal week, myonuclear accretion per myofibre decreased to  <dig>  nuclei per day . no significant difference in the number of myonuclei per myofibre was observed from p <dig> onwards, with mice at the oldest age examined of  <dig> months having a mean ± sem of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  myonuclei  . therefore, edl myofibre hypertrophic growth after p <dig> is without the addition of new myonuclei .

myonuclear domain increases throughout postnatal development
having both measured the mean myofibre length and counted the total number of myonuclei per myofibre from the same mice during postnatal growth, we could determine the number of myonuclei per unit myofibre length . this showed that there was no great change between p <dig> and p <dig>  even though the myofibres increased in length by  <dig> -fold over this period. however, between these ages the radial growth of the myofibres resulted in a  <dig> -fold increase in cross-sectional area . although measured from different cohorts of age-matched mice, using the myofibre length and cross-sectional area data allowed us to calculate a mean myofibre volume at each age examined . mean total myofibre volume increased from  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> at p <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> at p <dig> .

mean total myofibre volume was calculated from multiplying mean myofibre length by mean myofibre cross-sectional area at each age. myonuclear domain was derived by then dividing mean total myofibre volume by the mean number of myonuclei per myofibre at each age.

to obtain an estimate of myonuclear domain that took into account both radial and lengthwise myofibre growth, we then divided mean myofibre volume by the mean number of myonuclei per myofibre at each age . despite the continued addition of myonuclei up to p <dig>  the increase in myofibre volume was greater, so that the estimated myonuclear domain virtually doubled from  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> at p <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> at p <dig>  from p <dig> there was a 3-fold increase in myofibre volume without the net addition of further myonuclei, meaning that the myonuclear domain also expanded an estimated ~3-fold to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> at p <dig> 

satellite cell number falls during postnatal growth
having shown that myofibre length, cross-sectional area and number of myonuclei increased significantly during the first three postnatal weeks, we next examined the number of satellite cells over this period, since they are the source of postnatal myonuclei  <cit> . to identify satellite cells on isolated myofibres, we used our two mouse models that either positively or negatively mark satellite cells . as mentioned above, satellite cells in myf5nlacz/+ mice are identified directly by the expression of nuclear-localised β-galactosidase from the targeted myf <dig> allele  <cit> . we also used the 3f-nlacz-e transgenic mouse to quantify satellite cells on isolated myofibres, since β-galactosidase-negative nuclei are those of satellite cells, providing a means to identify the entire population, regardless of antigen expression  <cit> .

at p <dig>  each myofibre had a mean of ~ <dig> satellite cells , which then fell by  <dig>  cells per myofibre each day  to reach ~ <dig> by p <dig>  a fall of ~68% between p <dig> and p <dig>  satellite cells on edl myofibres reach their adult level by p <dig>  with no significant change thereafter , until at least the latest age examined of  <dig> months. thus before p <dig>  the number of satellite cells per myofibre is similar to the daily nuclear accretion rate: ~ <dig> satellite cells per myofibre when the mean rate of myonuclear addition is  <dig>  nuclei per day. between p <dig> and p <dig>  the myonuclear accumulation rate decreases to  <dig>  nuclei per day when the available mean satellite cell number decreases to ~ <dig> per myofibre.

we also expressed satellite cell numbers as a percentage of total nuclei per myofibre , to enable comparison with other studies. this equated to  <dig> % at p <dig>   <dig> % at p <dig> and falling to  <dig> % at p <dig>  however presenting the data this way exaggerates the rate of decline, since the denominator is not a constant, as mean myonuclear number increased ~ <dig> fold over this period .

most studies examining satellite cell numbers during postnatal growth have counted cells on muscle sections . therefore, we also determined satellite cell number in entire mid-belly edl sections from p <dig>  p <dig>  p <dig> and p <dig> mice, as an independent method to measure the dynamics of satellite cells in growing muscle. we used β-galactosidase activity from the targeted myf <dig> allele in myf5nlacz/+ mice to identify and count satellite cells. mean satellite cell number per edl cross-section was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at p <dig>  falling to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  at p <dig>  which was not significantly different from the number at p <dig> and p <dig> .

discussion
during the first three postnatal weeks in mouse, body mass and total muscle mass both increase almost 3-fold, and fibre length within the tibialis anterior muscle increases by more than 4-fold  <cit> . muscles can grow by an increase in total myofibre number and/or an increase in the size of individual myofibres. we found that the total number of myofibres in the mouse edl did not increase from p <dig>  in agreement with previous studies that myofibre number is set around birth in many muscles  <cit> . therefore, postnatal growth occurs by hypertrophy of existing myofibres. indeed, between p <dig> and p <dig>  myofibre cross-sectional area increased by  <dig> -fold and length by  <dig> -fold, together producing a mean total volume rise of  <dig> -fold over this period. such hypertrophy significantly contributes to the  <dig> -fold increase in mouse edl weight reported between 2- <dig> weeks of age  <cit> .

we also counted the number of myonuclei per myofibre using two independent mouse models and found that myonuclear addition only occurred during the first three postnatal weeks. we did not observe any regions of obvious higher myonuclear density during postnatal growth, as may have been expected if myonuclei were added preferentially to a particular region of the myofibre. myonuclear addition occurs mainly at the ends of myotubes during rat foetal developmental myogenesis  <cit>  and possibly in growing chicken muscle, where a high myonuclear density has been reported at myotendinous junctions  <cit> . however, there is no clear evidence that this also happens during postnatal growth or regeneration in mammals  <cit> , even though sarcomeres are serially added to the ends of mammalian myofibres during growth, and in mature muscles undergoing adaptation  <cit> .

the first two weeks are the most active period for the addition of new myonuclei, with myonuclear number doubling twice from p <dig> to p <dig>  the number of myonuclei increases from ~20% of the adult total, to ~81% by p <dig>  by the addition of over  <dig> myonuclei per myofibre each day. since muscle fibres are syncytia, each myonucleus supports a certain volume of cytoplasm in the myofibre - the myonuclear domain. despite the addition of these new myonuclei between p <dig> and p <dig>  the myofibre volume increased at a greater rate, so that the estimated myonuclear domain still expanded  <dig> -fold. between p <dig> and p <dig>  accumulation falls to  <dig>  myonuclei per day, with the full adult complement being reached by p <dig>  the greater increase in myofibre volume though, again results in myonuclear domain increasing by a further  <dig> -fold. thus, although the myofibre hypertrophy that occurs during early postnatal growth  is clearly supported by significant myonuclear accretion, the myonuclear domain still doubles due to the greater increase in myofibre volume. these observations refine the electron microscopy studies of ontell and colleagues  <cit>  in mouse edl, which indicated that the adult number of myonuclei was attained by their first assay point at p <dig>  not changing when next determined at p <dig> or p <dig>  our data shows that addition of new myonuclei continues for approximately another week, ending by p <dig> 

myofibres do not stop growing at p <dig> however, when myonuclear accretion ceases; we found that myofibres increased in cross-sectional area by almost  <dig> -fold and length by  <dig> -fold between p <dig> and p <dig>  accounting for an approximate 3-fold expansion in myofibre volume. ontell et al.  <cit>  reported that while mouse edl increases in mass by 25%, cross-sectional area only increased by ~20% between  <dig> and  <dig> weeks after birth, so presumably, most of the increase in cross-sectional area occurring after p <dig>  happens in the following week. since this significant 3-fold increase in myofibre hypertrophy after p <dig> is entirely orchestrated without the addition of significant numbers of myonuclei, the myonuclear domain must also expand, in fact rising a further  <dig> -fold to  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> 

the estimated myonuclear domain expanded ~ <dig> -fold from p <dig> to p <dig>  consistent with reported increases in growing rat between p <dig> and p <dig> in diaphragm  <cit>  and the 4-fold increase in soleus between p <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> . at p <dig>  our calculated myonuclear domain is  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> for entire intact myofibres. liu et al.  <cit>  used myofibre fragments from  <dig> month old mouse edl and calculated myonuclear domains for iix of  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig>  iib of  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> and iix/b of  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig>  which, we calculate, gives a mean of  <dig>  ×  <dig> μm <dig> for edl muscle fibres. therefore, there is an approximate 70% increase in myonuclear domain between  <dig> weeks  and  <dig> months of age  <cit>  in mouse. since we found that the number of myonuclei does not change between  <dig> weeks and  <dig> months, then the myonuclear domain can only expand with any further growth; indeed myonuclear domain has been reported to be 88% greater at  <dig> months than at  <dig> weeks in mouse edl  <cit> . it is worth noting that mice lacking the tgfβ-family member myostatin  have significantly larger edl myofibres  but less myonuclei per myofibre, showing that myonuclear domain is highly flexible during development  <cit> . certainly in adult human muscle, training-induced muscle hypertrophy can occur with an expansion of the myonuclear domain  <cit> . the considerable enlargement of myonuclear domain after p <dig> probably results from concomitant myonuclear maturation, increased protein synthesis and completion of protein isoform switching, including neonatal to adult myhc isoforms  <cit> .

we did not assess muscle fibre type in our study. myonuclear and satellite cell numbers differ between slow and fast fibre types, with slow generally containing more myonuclei and satellite cells than fast  <cit> . mouse edl has a near-uniform  fast fibre type in adult  <cit> , and this relative distribution of fast and slow fibres is established early, and does not change throughout postnatal development  <cit> . there is a shift from the neonatal myhc isoform to types iia/b/x during postnatal development, but iix and iib fibres have similar myonuclear domains in both mouse and rat  <cit> . therefore, the maturation of the myofibres to their adult fibre type, and near uniform fast fibre type composition during the period of study, both mean that expressing myonuclei and satellite cell numbers per edl myofibre should not mask any major differences between muscle fibre types.

since muscle satellite cells are the source of myonuclei postnatally  <cit> , we also examined their number during the postnatal growth period using our two complementary mouse models. there are several useful markers for identifying satellite cells  <cit> , but one of the most convenient is the expression of nuclear-localised β-galactosidase from the targeted myf <dig> allele of myf5nlacz/+ mice  <cit> . in contrast, the 3f-nlacz-e transgenic mouse has robust nlacz expression in myonuclei, allowing the quantification of satellite cells by locating and counting dapi-positive nuclei without β-galactosidase activity on isolated myofibres  <cit> . since there is debate about whether certain antigens are expressed in all satellite cells  <cit> , use of 3f-nlacz-e mice allows the entire satellite cell population to be identified, regardless of an antigen's expression domain. importantly, counting either β-galactosidase-positive nuclei on myofibres from myf5nlacz/+ mice, or non-nlacz expressing nuclei on myofibres from 3f-nlacz-e mice using dapi, gave similar results. satellite cell number per myofibre was highest at the earliest age analysed, with ~ <dig> satellite cells per myofibre at p6/ <dig>  there was a linear fall in satellite cell numbers to ~ <dig> at p <dig>  until the adult number of ~ <dig> was reached by p <dig> 

when satellite cell numbers are expressed as a percentage of total nuclei, their decrease is exaggerated by the rapid increase in myonuclear number . ontell reported that satellite cells account for 11% of sublaminal nuclei at p <dig>  which decreases to 5% by p <dig>  <cit> . we found this to be closer to  <dig> % at p <dig>  falling to  <dig> % by p <dig>  therefore while both studies report an approximate halving of the satellite cell pool during this period, the electron microscope studies appear to overestimate the number of satellite cells when using myonuclei per section as the denominator. it is interesting to note though, that our satellite cell and myonuclei data, projected back to birth, produce estimates that satellite cells would account for 31-35% of total sublaminal nuclei, the same range previously reported for mouse peroneus longus muscle at birth using electron microscopy  <cit> .

associating satellite cell and myonuclear number uncovered an interesting correlation: in the early postnatal period , the number of satellite cells per fibre is similar to the rate of myonuclear addition each day. there were ~ <dig> satellite cells per myofibre until p <dig>  when the mean addition of myonuclei was  <dig>  per day. since the satellite cell number is relatively stable over this period, it implies that most satellite cells are undergoing asymmetric divisions, each giving rise to both a myonucleus and a new satellite cell, as first suggested by moss and leblond in  <dig>  <cit> . between p <dig> and p <dig>  the available number of satellite cells decreases from ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> per myofibre, and the rate of myonuclear accumulation decreases to  <dig>  nuclei per day. while some satellite cells are clearly lost, most must still be producing both differentiated progeny and also undergoing self-renewal to maintain their own population.

each satellite cell producing a single myonucleus and self-renewing each day indicates a cell cycle time of approximately  <dig> hours. it is a crucial to know however, how many of these satellite cells are actually proliferating? pulsing with brdu twice daily between p <dig> and p <dig>  revealed that 78% of satellite cells in mouse edl were labelled at p <dig>  so had undergone at least one cell division during this period  <cit> . a similar proportion of satellite cells  were also readily labelled by extended pulsing in growing rat muscle  <cit> . from this, we estimate an in vivo proliferation rate with a cell cycle doubling time of approximately  <dig> hours during the first two postnatal weeks, slowing to ~ <dig> hours by p <dig>  in adult, the estimated cell cycle doubling time is  <dig> hours, i.e. the satellite cells have become quiescent as expected  <cit> . combined brdu and thymidine pulsing has been used to calculate a cell cycle time of  <dig> hours in growing rats in vivo  <cit> . moss and leblond  <cit>  reported that the number of satellite cells that incorporated thymidine doubled within  <dig> hours of labelling and that those labelled cells contributed to myonuclei within  <dig> to  <dig> hours, indicating a significantly shorter cell cycle time. growth dynamics are different between rats and mice though, with the edl adding myonuclei until p <dig> in rat  <cit> , so it would not be unexpected if cell cycle time in growing mouse was significantly shorter. for adult, bischoff has calculated cell cycle times for mouse satellite cells in vitro at  <dig> hours  <cit> , whereas we have previously calculated about  <dig> hours  <cit> .

interestingly, it has recently been shown that the transcription factor pax <dig> is essential for satellite cell function up to ~p <dig>  <cit> , which coincides with the age that myofibres cease to grow by the addition of myonuclei supplied by satellite cells, and a population of mitotically quiescent satellite cells is established. around p <dig> is also when the chronic cycles of degeneration and regeneration begin in the mdx mouse model of duchenne muscular dystrophy  <cit> . speculatively, the presence of actively dividing satellite cells before p <dig> may permit the rapid repair of damaged myofibres, so ameliorating the dystrophic phenotype at this time. however, muscle damage occurring after p <dig> must first elicit satellite cell activation from quiescence, which may delay the repair process, so allowing myofibre degeneration to occur.

CONCLUSIONS
since the total myofibre content of edl does not change during the first three weeks of postnatal life, muscle growth is achieved by myofibre hypertrophy, which is accompanied by the addition of significant amounts of new myonuclei . despite this increase in myonuclear number during this period, the myonuclear domain still doubles in size. the number of satellite cells per myofibre is similar to the daily myonuclear accretion rate until p <dig>  when the adult configuration of myonuclei and satellite cells is established. the significant myofibre hypertrophy that continues from p <dig> to adulthood therefore, occurs without the net addition of myonuclei, so results in a large  expansion of the myonuclear domain.
