BACKGROUND
molecular markers are widely used in plant research for candidate gene or qtl identification through linkage or association mapping as well as analysis of population structure and evolution. it has also become a major resource for accelerated plant breeding through marker assisted selection  <cit> . snps  are now the genetic markers of choice since they are a virtually unlimited, evenly distributed along the genome, bi-allelic and co-dominant resource. moreover, an increasing number of technologies are now available for fast and inexpensive genotyping, from medium  to very high throughput . until recently, massive snp discovery was limited to a few species for which a reference genome was available, such as maize  <cit>  or arabidopsis  <cit> ; http://naturalvariation.org/hapmap). tremendous advances in next generation sequencing technologies now make it feasible to sequence even complex genomes at a reasonable cost  <cit> . in addition, the challenge due to large genomes with very high levels of repeated sequences has led to the development of different approaches to reduce genome complexity. methyl-filtration which targets hypo-methylated gene-enriched regions was applied to develop markers in maize  <cit>  or switchgrass  <cit> . cdna sequencing appears as a simple way to address the expressed genic fraction. transcriptome sequencing was intensively described in a wide range of species, including models , and crops with large genomes  <cit> , including field pea  <cit> . a number of these sequencing studies have led to the development of snp markers with applications in diversity panel structuration or genetic mapping in cereals  <cit> , oilcrops  <cit> , and model  <cit>  or cultivated legumes  <cit> . although considered an important legume crop, there has been a surprisingly low effort yet in developing snp markers for field pea mapping or diversity studies  <cit> .

pisum sativum is the third grain legume crop in the world after soybean and common bean and is a major source of proteins for both human food and livestock feed. moreover, pea is particularly relevant in cropping systems due to its capacity to fix nitrogen through symbiosis. nevertheless, the species suffers from significant yield instability due to high susceptibility to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . resistance qtls have been described, but with still large confidence intervals due to low resolution of existing genetic maps. it remains a challenge both  to understand underlying mechanisms and identify the candidate genes involved, and  to reduce qtls confidence interval sizes and develop breeding programs using powerful molecular markers.

field pea can be considered to be an orphan species considering its limited genomic resources. its genome covers  <dig>  gb, which is around  <dig> times larger than the genome of the model species m. truncatula <cit> , including repeats mostly based on transposon-based sequences  <cit> . to date no full genome sequence and only poor est resources  are available. recent reports show that large new sequencing resources are under development  <cit>  and that a consortium for pea genome sequencing is being built . however, these efforts have not yet reached the development of large numbers of new molecular markers to saturate pea maps and improve qtl mapping both towards research and breeding objectives. available genetic maps in pea remain low to medium density, and are based mainly on a few hundred ssrs  <cit>  and snps  <cit> . it is therefore strategic for field pea breeding to develop large new resources for mapping and genetic improvement.

analyzing polymorphism within this species through a whole genome resequencing strategy is difficult and genome complexity reduction is mandatory. franssen  <cit>  first described large scale transcriptome sequencing with the objective to provide a comprehensive reference set for further analysis in the species. kaur  <cit>  further investigated marker development through transcriptome sequencing of different tissues from four field pea cultivars and identified  <dig> gene-related ssr markers,  <dig> of which were genotyped, with  <dig> eventually displaying polymorphism within a set of six genotypes. even though the two studies gave rise to a significant enrichment in est contigs and resources, they did not provide a large marker resource.

our objective, to complement the existing resources and to better fit with research and breeding demand for markers, was to develop a comprehensive snp database in pea with extended validation in breeding and genetic mapping positions. for this purpose, we deeply sequenced eight genotypes representing the genetic diversity present in modern breeding material, and developed a dedicated bioinformatics pipeline for assembly and snp identification.

RESULTS
discovery of  <dig>  highly reliable snp
eight p. sativum genotypes were selected for sequencing, in order to address genetic diversity present in european breeding material, including six spring sown, one winter sown field pea as well as one fodder pea cultivar. cdna was normalized prior to the sequencing step in order to smooth out differences between highly and poorly expressed genes. the normalization efficiency was assessed by q-pcr on  <dig> genes selected for showing a wide range of expression levels . low cp values  increased from 10– <dig> to 15– <dig> between control and normalized cdnas for all genotypes, a shift of five pcr cycles corresponding approximately to a  <dig> fold decrease in abundance. at the same time no significant change was observed for high cp values , suggesting that cdna normalization did not remove rare transcripts and therefore raised their overall relative abundance.

the eight normalized cdna samples, one for each cultivar, were subjected to  <dig> sequencing and data assembly. from half a sequencing run dedicated to each sample, we generated  <dig>  to  <dig>  raw reads per sample, reaching a total of  <dig>  mb from  <dig> , <dig> reads. median read length per genotype ranged from  <dig> to 420 bp and 68% to 78% of the read lengths were between  <dig> and 600 bp depending on the sample. after data cleaning for small/long reads, pcr duplicates and low complexity sequences, we kept 78% of available sequences. the last cleaning steps consisted in masking repeated sequences and removing chloroplast derived sequences:  <dig>  mb of high quality sequences were eventually used for de novo assembly .

eighty percent of the data could be assembled  in  <dig>  contigs, representing a cumulated length of 58 mb. n <dig> contig size was 956 bp, average size was 842 bp, and the longest one reached  <dig>  bp . overlap between genotypes was high as 70% of contigs were covered by reads from at least four different genotypes .

out of the  <dig>  contigs, hits were found for  <dig>   against uniprot and  <dig>   against m. truncatula predicted proteins with e-value lower than 1e- <dig>  informative description was assigned to  <dig>  contigs .  <dig>  contigs were annotated from uniprot  and  <dig>  contigs from m. truncatula proteins. altogether,  <dig>  annotations were “similar to” and  <dig>  “highly similar to” . a total of  <dig>  non-redundant matches against m. truncatula proteins were found, which is slightly more than the  <dig>   <cit>  and  <dig>   <cit>  found on previous assemblies of the pea transcriptome.

snp calling
a total of  <dig>  putative snps were called, among which  <dig>  met the selection criteria for robustness. these  <dig>  highly reliable snps were found in  <dig>  contigs, among which  <dig>   had a hit below 1e- <dig> against uniprot  and were further annotated using blast2go:  <dig>   could be annotated with a go term  . the coordinates of the  <dig>  contigs’ best homologs along the m. truncatula chromosomes are described in the supplementary data . a majority of the detected polymorphisms  had a minor allele frequency of 1/ <dig>  which means they were brought by only one genotype. almost half of them were brought by the fodder pea champagne, the most distant genetically to the other seven field pea genotypes. eleven thousand eight hundred and three snps were polymorphic between champagne and terese, which could be used for further genetic map densification purposes using the champagne x terese derived ril population.

selection and validation of a  <dig> snp set in a goldengate assay
based on both technical and biological criteria  we selected  <dig> snp, out of the 35 k, for genotyping. in order to ensure representativeness of this snp subset, we looked at go term assignment as well as at the distribution along m. truncatula chromosomes. go terms distributions were generally conserved between the complete set of  <dig>  annotated contigs and the genotyped subset of  <dig> contigs for each type of annotation . only  <dig> terms  were over-represented and two terms  under-represented in the genotyped subset . in addition, we found little difference in the distribution of pea contig homologs along m. truncatula chromosomes between the two data sets, contigs from both data sets showing even distributions along the chromosomes  except for a few m. truncatula chromosomal regions that remained uncovered both by the whole dataset and by the  <dig> snp subset, the largest on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the  <dig> subset therefore constituted an unbiased sampling of the whole snp resource generated.
m. truncatula 
pseudo-chromosomes  of the  <dig>  pea polymorphic cdna contigs  and the  <dig>  pea cdna contigs  selected for genotyping.

from  <dig> snps selected for the goldengate assay,  <dig>  were successfully genotyped  on either a diversity panel of pea accessions, or on one or more of four pea ril populations. the remaining  <dig> snps  failed due to missing or non-interpretable signal. genotyped snps were classified between a and h quality levels , most of them  having the highest quality . only  <dig> snps presented a major allele frequency above  <dig>  and  <dig> markers proved to be monomorphic which indicates a low false positive rate during our process of snp calling and selection. among the  <dig> successfully genotyped snp markers,  <dig> revealed the expected biallelic codominant polymorphism in the pea diversity panel, and  <dig> showed polymorphism in at least one of the four parental pairs of ril populations. few markers presented genotyping abnormalities :  <dig> could not be genotyped in one out of the four ril populations;  <dig> presented a dispersed cloud of data for one allele and should be used with caution ;  <dig> corresponded to multilocus or copy number variations;  <dig> showed a dominant  allele for at least one ril population, among which  <dig> were classified in “d” quality level.

validation of a  <dig> snp set in a goldengate assay for pea genetic diversity assessment, and selection of an informative  <dig> snp sub-set
classification of the  <dig> accessions of the diversity panel through a ward hierarchical clustering showed the ability of the  <dig> genotyped snps to group pea genotypes into two main clusters : cluster  <dig> consisted of  <dig> accessions including  <dig> spring sown field pea cultivars and could be divided into three sub clusters: subcluster 1– <dig> contained  <dig> accessions of spring sown field pea cultivars from various breeding companies and unexpectedly one winter sown pea accession . most of these cultivars were developed for and registered in northern europe  and used for various ends including human food and exports. subcluster 1– <dig> consisted of  <dig> accessions of spring sown field pea cultivars representing different breeding companies’ programmes and end-uses, including feed peas that are registered and developed in france. subcluster 1– <dig> consisted of one winter sown field pea accession  and one spring sown field pea  that seem to be genetically close. cluster  <dig> grouped  <dig> accessions and could be divided into two sub clusters: subcluster 2– <dig> consisted of  <dig> accessions of garden pea accessions, spring field pea breeding and recombinant lines from a breeding program aiming at incorporating aphanomyces euteiches resistance from garden pea resistance sources. cluster 2– <dig> consisted of  <dig> winter sown field pea cultivars or breeding lines, together with two fodder pea accessions .

the factorial analysis confirmed the same global structuration as the ward hierarchical clustering, with axis  <dig> and  <dig> explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of variance respectively . a first group  clearly identified spring field pea cultivars belonging exclusively to cluster  <dig>  cultivars belonging to subclusters 1– <dig> and 1– <dig> were still separated within g <dig> except for cv ardan. a second group  clearly grouped winter field pea cultivars and fodder peas consistent with subcluster 2– <dig> of the hierarchical clustering. a third group  comprised garden and field pea accessions from the a.euteiches resistance breeding program consistently with subcluster 2– <dig> of the hierarchical clustering. interestingly, the factorial analysis identified intermediate positions of the two cultivars belonging to subcluster 1- <dig>  between the g <dig> and the g <dig>  and confirmed the unexpected position of the winter sown cultivar indiana . finally, seven accessions, mostly lying in subcluster 1- <dig>  and mainly corresponding to marrowfat pea cultivars, showed intermediate positions between g <dig> and g <dig> 

a classification of  <dig> genotyped snps was performed using a transposed matrix through a ward hierarchical clustering using the genotyping data of the  <dig> accessions of the diversity panel. forty-eight sub-clusters of snps were defined , within which two to ten snps were chosen based on snp quality level, and position on the consensus map to select a  <dig> snp subset. this defined  <dig> snp subset  classified the  <dig> pea accessions of the diversity panel as well as the  <dig> snp set into the same five clusters . fifty-nine accessions were conserved identically on the maximum agreement sub-tree  resulting in the comparison of the two ward hierarchical clustering. from the  <dig> accessions, only three moved from one sub-cluster to another : ardan and rebel from sub-cluster 1– <dig> to sub-cluster 1– <dig>  , and e <dig> from sc2- <dig> to sc2- <dig>  .

validation of the  <dig> snp set in a goldengate assay for genetic mapping in pea
a new high-density composite pea genetic map, covering 1255 cm and including the newly developed snp markers was constructed from a matrix composed of  <dig> markers ×  <dig> genotypes from four ril populations. for each genotyped snp, the flanking sequence, the best blast hit on the m. truncatula genome of its associated contig, the corresponding annotation, the quality index, the rate of polymorphism and its position on the new p. sativum composite map are described . the percentages of snps that showed segregation distortion  were estimated at  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in populations derived from the crosses ji296xdp, champagnexterese, chinaxcameor and baccaraxpi <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> markers could be reliably mapped including  <dig> snp from the present study  and  <dig> previously mapped markers , giving a density of  <dig>  markers per cm. this map presented only one gap larger than 10 cm between two contiguous markers, and only  <dig> gaps larger than 10 cm between contiguous newly developed snps . marker density was high and similar for all p. sativum linkage groups , ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  markers/cm  with the noticeable exception of pslgii for which the marker density was  <dig>  . positions of the  <dig> previously mapped markers on our consensus map were generally collinear with their published positions  <cit>  :  <dig> to  <dig> markers mapped on each linkage group were common with both the loridon et al. <cit>  and bordat et al. <cit>  consensus maps . except for a few local inversions, collinearity of these markers was maintained along the three maps, with the notable exception of the pslgii for which a block inversion was observed at the distal part lgii with the loridon et al. <cit>  consensus map but not with the bordat et al. <cit>  consensus map . map sizes were similar between the present consensus map , the loridon et al. map   <cit>  and the bordat et al. map   <cit>  but the number of mapped markers was increased 4-fold in comparison to those previous composite reference maps, respectively comprising  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig>  <cit>  markers.

synteny between a  <dig> snp-based pea genetic map and the m. truncatula physical map
from the  <dig> mapped snp,  <dig> provided a link between their original cdna contigs on the pea linkage groups and the position of their best blast hits on the m. truncatula pseudo-chromosomes. over 75% of these  <dig> links presented a highly conserved organization between the seven pea lgs, and the eight m. truncatula pseudo-chromosomes . this was summarized by a dotplot of macrosyntenic relationships . clear blocks of synteny were observed with varying levels of rearrangements: pslgi, pslgii, pslgiv, pslgv, and pslgvii corresponded to m. truncatula chromosomes mtrchr <dig>  mtrchr <dig>  mtrchr <dig>  mtrchr <dig>  and mtrchr <dig> respectively, with some local inversions. a number of rearrangements could be observed, such as those between pslgiii compared to mtrchr <dig> and mtrchr <dig> as well as pslgvi compared to mtrchr <dig> and mtrchr  <dig>  the mtchr <dig> in m. truncatula corresponded to the major part of the pea pslgiii but showed many breaks and reversals blocks. the central part of pslgvi corresponded to the entire mtchr <dig>  its upper part to the upper portion of the mtchr <dig>  and its lower part to the central part of mtchr <dig>  finally the lower and middle portions of mtchr <dig> corresponded to pslgvi, and its upper part to the upper part of pslgiii, with two collinear blocks framing two reversed blocks .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
sequencing of eight cdna normalized libraries from genotypes representative of modern pea breeding material allowed the assembly of a large collection of cdna contigs, and identification of over  <dig>  reliable snp markers. a subset of snps were genotyped with the golden gate assay to generate a high density composite genetic map including  <dig> newly developed snps and anchored on the m. truncatula physical map.

normalized cdna sequencing: an appropriate strategy for development of markers in an orphan species
transcriptome sequencing is an efficient strategy for genome reduction in non-model species since it focuses on coding regions rather than on the entire genome. this is especially true in plants where the size and the repetitive nature of the genomes reduce the coding fraction. in the case of pea,  <dig> to 97% of the genome  <cit>  is covered by repeats. the drawback of cdna sequencing is that the number of sequences by gene reflects its expression level in the extracted tissue. cdna normalization is an efficient way of limiting over-representation of genes with high expression rates, and ensuring a representation of genes with low expression rates. indeed, the comparison of pea cdna sequencing with and without normalization showed a loss of 30% of represented genes when no normalization was made  <cit> . in our study, the qpcr performed on  <dig> genes representative of a wide range of expression levels clearly shows that normalization reduced the abundance of genes with high expression rates without affecting the abundance of moderately and weakly expressed genes. our results also indicate that there is still a significant correlation between raw and normalized data, as shown by franssen et al. <cit> .

data assembly and snp calling
since at the time this project was initiated very little sequence data was available for pea , the chosen strategy was de novo sequencing and assembly. like for many other non-model plants transcriptome sequencing projects  <cit> , we chose to use the roche/ <dig> platform with the gs-flx titanium chemistry which provides long read lengths  which is critical for de novo assembly. while many different assembly strategies combining different tools have been tested in previous transcriptome studies  <cit> , we chose to use the mira assembler, which was present in the top three assemblers used in recent  <dig> transcriptome projects  <cit>  and has proven to work well on pea  <cit>  and on other complex species like rapeseed  <cit>  or wheat  <cit> .

previous pea transcriptome assemblies using the roche  <dig> technology reported an average contig length of 324 bp from 250 bp read length  <cit> , or an average contig length of 719 bp  <cit> . we obtained a longer average contig length  and n <dig> , closer to this last report. furthermore, a comparison of our assembly to previous ones showed that it covers them well with  <dig>  contigs  out of  <dig>  from franssen et al.  <cit>  and  <dig>   out of  <dig>  from kaur et al.  <cit>  having a hit against our assembly . reciprocally from  <dig>  contigs from this study,  <dig>   and  <dig>   had a hit against franssen et al.  <cit>  and against kaur et al.  <cit>  assemblies respectively. the nearly  <dig>  contigs from our assembly that show no similarity with previous datasets may be due to a higher sequencing effort in this study . we can anticipate that new sequencing technologies, such as the illumina miseq that now generates 2× <dig> bp at a lower cost will help to design new sequencing projects with both long reads and deep coverage.

the objectives of the earlier studies mentioned above aimed at ssr development and validation  <cit> , or exhaustive representation of expressed genes  <cit> , whereas this study clearly focused its experimental design and bioinformatics analysis on identification of snp markers easy to genotype with high throughput technologies. although they all contributed to generating pea cdna contig sequences, it appears that these three recent studies could be complementary in many points to better characterize the pea transcriptome.

we also developed a dedicated script for snp calling adapted to the data we generated. for validation purpose, we assessed by genotyping  <dig> snp  using illumina goldengate veracode technology on a large number of pea accessions, from which  <dig> were confirmed as true snp. this high validation rate , although expected on a diploid species with such a technology, fully validated the chosen bioinformatics pipeline for snp calling.

high density genetic map bridged to m. truncatula by synteny
this study presents the first high-density pea composite map mainly based on snps likely to enable large-scale studies by both academic and breeder users.

the map size obtained was similar to the ones observed in previous reference composite maps based on ssr  <cit>  or genic markers  <cit> , but with a 4-fold increase in marker density, raising overall resolution to 1 cm. this new high density composite map also makes a significant step forward following the founder mapping of reduced sets of snp markers in pea by deulvot et al. <cit>  and legrand et al. <cit> . the presence of a ril population as well as more than a hundred markers in common with previous composite maps greatly facilitated the comparison and potential use of the newly developed snp in a range of pea populations. a high level of collinearity was observed for the  <dig> markers that were common to other p. sativum maps  <cit> , which make the newly developed  <dig> mapped snps a useful tool for future studies focusing on a genomic region or trait in pea. this new composite map will allow resolution of previous or future conflicting data in pea mapping. for instance the block inversion shown in the distal part of the pslgii on the loridon et al. <cit>  map is probably a mis-assembly of two blocks distant by more than 30 cm due to a lack of markers on this map, whereas this gap was filled and the inversion resolved in our study.

one thousand two hundred and fifty-two snps derived from pea cdnas were anchored to the genome of the model species m. truncatula which opens the door to large-scale syntenic studies. previous studies reported a high level of macrosynteny between pea and medicago genomes  <cit> . the most comprehensive study to date  <cit>  placed  <dig> pea unigenes on the m. truncatula physical map but only  <dig> bridges between the genomes were truly mapped in pea. since genotyped snps were selected on the basis of pea contigs’ homology to m. truncatula, the number of potential bridges between the two species increases now to approximately  <dig> . since collinearity for some loci has not always been found, a reciprocal blast from medicago to pea should be performed, as described by bordat et al.  <cit> , to confirm our results. in any case, the high density of collinear bridges generated here will allow further investigation of apparently complex genome reorganization spots between the two species, such as for instance the complex structuration of pslgiii and pslgvi.

classification of modern pea cultivars and breeding lines
we addressed modern field pea breeding genetic diversity by genotyping  <dig> genotypes. the panel was structured into clusters, separating cultivated types of spring field peas, winter field peas, garden peas and lines of interest for a. euteiches resistance. only two apparent classification mismatches were detected , probably due to registration as winter pea of cultivars that are derived from the spring pea gene pool . subclustering within spring pea cultivars did not separate gene pools from different breeding companies or according to geography, which shows that the narrow gene pool used in spring pea breeding in france is shared by main pea breeders. subclustering within winter pea cultivars did not separate gene pools from different breeders either, but clearly showed that winter pea cultivars are mostly derived from fodder peas. finally, the main division lies between spring sown and winter sown pea breeding, although one may feed the other for some crosses which may be the origin of the few mismatches observed. this structuration into cultivated types is consistent with a number of previous reports regarding the classification of a large diversity of germplasm  <cit>  or focusing mainly on the classification of cultivars  <cit> , using different kinds of pcr based molecular markers. newly developed snps therefore show efficiency in structuring diversity in pea cultivars, even using the proposed reduced set of  <dig> informative snps.

a comprehensive resource for academic research and breeding in pea
this study generated three major resources that will address both research issues regarding genetic control of traits of interest, and breeding issues for the introgression and management of these traits into cultivated gene pools.

first, the new composite genetic map, that reaches the cm level resolution, will undoubtedly have a major impact on genetic analysis of traits in pea to fine map and refine qtl confidence intervals, and to identify underlying candidate genes. moreover, almost all the 35 k snps identified can be ordered on the medicago genome according to blast results and can therefore be a reservoir of snps for marker densification within regions of interest. this newly available resource of bridge markers between species will allow synteny based qtl mapping, candidate gene identification and cloning between pea and m. truncatula in regions of interest, such as those identified for a. euteiches resistance  <cit> , or for frost resistance  <cit> . it will also allow breeders to select new markers from that reservoir which will better describe their introgressions and improve marker-assisted selection.

second, the 68 k pea cdna contigs generated constitute an additional and complementary sequence resource to the recently published ones  <cit> , which will help for the definition of the pea gene space. a potential use of this resource could for instance be a targeted genotyping of a ril population through resequencing for high density genetic mapping. very high density genetic maps appear mandatory for scaffold anchoring in sequencing projects and the emerging pea genome sequencing project  will benefit from it. indeed, the increased reliability and density of the map developed, combined with syntenic projections within the newly sequenced model species m. truncatula, will help in defining the structure of the pea genome, and to investigate in more details complex reorganizations like fracture zones and inverted blocks between the two genomes. chromosomal rearrangements within pea lines will also be investigated by comparing the consensus map to individual maps  <cit>  of different ril populations.

third, different snp sets were generated:  <dig>  technically reliable,  <dig>  anchored to the m. truncatula physical map,  <dig>  mapped on the pea genetic map,  <dig>  polymorphic across a collection of modern pea cultivars,  <dig> optimally representing differentiation between these cultivars. these data sets could be used by pea breeders for a variety of applications, such as selection of genetically distant lines, follow up of haplotypes in the progenies, or monitoring of the presence of favorable alleles for agronomic traits for variety registration purposes.

the combined use of these three resources provides a powerful tool for marker assisted selection. it gives comprehensive knowledge for the selection of subsets of snp markers to use from polymorphism, mapping and hierarchical information. finally, the proposed resources will undoubtedly help in directing the creation of new pea ideotypes cumulating alleles at new qtls for traits of interest, adapted to various climates and cropping systems, with stabilized and high yields.
