BACKGROUND
the cellular activities are in a continuous state of dynamism and one of the most notable activities in a cell that exemplifies it is gene transcription. genetic message embedded in the transcripts is translated into proteins that execute predetermined cellular processes. additionally, some of the transcripts are not translated, but still have the ability to regulate the transcriptional and post transcriptional processes  <cit> . the immediate response of a cell on imposition of a detrimental stress is to take evasive action, which is exhibited by a substantial shutdown of transcription. concurrently, transcripts of genes, that can mitigate stress injury starts accumulating, the products of which either provide instant protection or salvage the stress-damaged components. therefore, a large number of studies have focused on the identification of transcripts that are regulated by stress, as they provide a framework for biotechnological approaches to alleviate stress injuries and thereby can be used to make stress tolerant organisms  <cit> . present understanding of plant response to abiotic stresses reveals that withstanding an adverse condition is a multigenic trait and breeding approaches based on the available germplasm variability has led to significant success in developing environmentally hardy plants  <cit> . in addition to the breeding approaches, overexpression of candidate genes and upstream transcriptional regulators has been widely used to introduce tolerance against abiotic stresses  <cit> . because of the multigenic nature of the trait, it is important to collate information on all the molecular factors that orchestrate together to constitute a cellular state of stress tolerance. many of these factors are co-expressed in response to a stimulus and therefore genomic scale investigations using either microarray or cdna sequencing are often helpful in their identification. one of the recent approaches used for whole-genome identification of transcripts is rna-seq, which relies on sequencing small stretches of rna-derived cdnas at a very high coverage. the small sequences are later assembled with advanced computing tools to reconstruct the transcript. as rna-seq provides an absolute measure of the quantity, it can be used to deduce the relative expression of a transcript in two different tissues/conditions. additionally, because rna-seq is an open-ended approach, it has been widely used to sequence and assemble de-novo transcriptome of various organisms  <cit> .

brassica juncea  l.  commonly known as ‘indian mustard’ is an important oilseed crop. it is a natural amphidiploid species that originated from a cross between b. rapa  and b. nigra . it is widely grown in india, canada, australia, china and russia  <cit> . considering its economic importance, efforts has been undertaken to augment its economically and agronomically significant traits like oil content, oil quality, seed size, pod shattering and pathogen resistance  <cit> . however, only a few studies have addressed the effects of abiotic stresses in brassicas  <cit> . in indian subcontinent an early sowing and harvesting of indian mustard is preferred so that the crop can be harvested before the onset of detrimental aphid attack. due to an increase in mean temperatures globally, many a times in india, farmers shift sowing of b. juncea from october to november and render the crop to aphid attack during it’s maturation. cultivars of b. juncea whose seedlings can germinate efficiently under higher temperatures  can help in escaping the aphid attack as these cultivars can be harvested before the onset of such an attack. the water footprint of b. juncea is very small as compared to most of the other cash crops of india, nevertheless, seedling emergence and its sustainability are severely hampered under severe drought conditions  <cit> . additionally, incidences of high temperature and drought stress during pod development are known to reduce seed setting  <cit> . to fully comprehend the response of b. juncea we sequenced and assembled transcriptome of its seedlings that were subjected either to high temperature or drought conditions.

till now three independent research studies have been carried out to explore the transcriptome of b. juncea. sun et al.  <cit>  performed high throughput sequencing to identify the genes involved in stem swelling in b. juncea var. tumida tsen et lee, commonly known as tumorous stem mustard  <cit> . sequencing of rna-seq libraries obtained from different developmental stages of stem of two contrasting strains namely, yong’an  and dayejie  generated approximately  <dig> million reads. nearly  <dig>  million unigenes were predicted out of which around one thousand genes were differentially expressed in the six comparison groups. in another study, liu et al.  <cit>  investigated seed coat related transcriptome in b. juncea varieties sichuan yellow seed  and its brown-seeded near-isogenic line a   <cit> . they identified  <dig> unigenes out of which  <dig> were shown to be involved in flavonoid biosynthesis pathways. recently, paritosh et al.  <cit>  explored transcriptome of b. juncea var. varuna  and b. juncea var. heera  to catalogue existing single nucleotide polymorphisms  in the two distantly related varieties. nearly  <dig>  million snps were identified among which  <dig> belong to “a” genome and  <dig> are present in “b” genome. these snps can be utilized for fine mapping of agronomically important traits and will shed light on the diversification of brassica species  <cit> . as per our understanding abiotic stress related transcriptome investigations have not been carried out in b. juncea. however, such studies have been performed in closely related b. rapa and b. napus  <cit> . yu et al.  <cit>  performed rna-seq of drought stressed b. rapa plants to analyze changes in its transcriptome. analysis of sequenced tags identified  <dig> dehydration responsive genes, many of which were transcription factors  <cit> . in another study by zou et al.  <cit> , genome-wide gene expression changes were identified under waterlogging stress in zs <dig>  a waterlogging-tolerant variety of b. napus. high-throughput sequencing of the libraries generated approximately  <dig> million reads. data analysis of these libraries revealed presence of  <dig> differently expressed genes between the control and waterlogged sample  <cit> .

in the present study we performed high throughput sequencing of the coding transcriptome in b. juncea seedlings that were challenged either with high temperature or drought stress. more than  <dig> million purity filtered reads were used for de-novo assembly resulting in identification of approximately  <dig> unique transcripts. nearly  <dig>  transcripts were annotated out of which  <dig> were kinases and  <dig> were transcription factors . expression analysis revealed that  <dig> transcripts were differentially regulated by either high temperature and/or drought stress as compared to the control sample. amongst the differentially expressed transcripts were  <dig> tfs whose expression changed in response to high temperature. similarly, drought stress resulted in a significant change in steady state levels of  <dig> tfs. moreover,  <dig> tfs were regulated by both high temperature and drought stress. among the up-regulated tfs, hsf and dreb constituted the most responsive tf families in bhs and bds, respectively. significant alterations in levels of  <dig> protein kinases by elevated temperature and water deprivation were also noticed. we observed that  <dig> and  <dig> protein kinase genes were specifically regulated by drought and high temperature, respectively. a substantial number of kinases  were regulated by both high temperature and drought. role of differentially regulated transcripts was analyzed by their corresponding gene ontologies. furthermore, we were able to map  <dig> of the differentially regulated transcripts in  <dig> metabolic pathways. our study not only provides a transcriptome resource that can be utilized for improvement of b. juncea and related crops but also improves realm of our existing knowledge for high temperature and drought regulated genes at a genome-wide level.

RESULTS
high throughput sequencing, quality filtering and de-novo assembly
three transcriptome libraries were constructed using poly a+ rna isolated from hydroponically grown 7-day old whole seedlings that were kept under controlled conditions  or challenged with high temperature  or drought . high throughput sequencing of transcriptome libraries using illumina ga iix platform generated an aggregate of  <dig>  million purity filtered reads amounting to  <dig>  gb of data. individually, maximum number of reads was obtained in control  followed by high temperature stress  and drought stress  samples. the reads which had adapter contamination and low base quality  were removed to retain approximately  <dig>  million,  <dig> million and  <dig>  million high quality  reads in bc, bhs and bds samples, respectively. the number of reads that were eliminated from data so as to retain only the hq reads is presented in table  <dig>  subsequently, the base composition of hq reads was examined to rule out sequencing bias .table  <dig>

raw reads from control , high temperature  and drought  stress libraries were subjected to various quality control parameters and reads that had contamination of adapter sequence or of low quality were eliminated. only high quality paired and orphan reads were pooled for assembly.



to generate a comprehensive assembly, hq reads from all the libraries were pooled generating a population of nearly  <dig>  million reads. due to unavailability of assembled genomic sequence in b. juncea, reads were ‘de-novo’ assembled using soapdenovo  <cit> . the overall strategy of de-novo assembly by utilizing hq reads is presented in figure  <dig>  data was independently assembled with different k-mer lengths of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> bases. the consolidated results of the assembled data obtained for each of the above k-mers are presented in table  <dig>  maximum numbers of contigs  were obtained at  <dig> k-mer, whereas assembly at  <dig> k-mer yielded the highest output of  <dig>  million bp. as expected, length of the longest assembled transcript gradually decreased with an increasing k-mer for e.g. length of longest transcript was  <dig> bp at  <dig> k-mer and was  <dig> bp at  <dig> k-mer. average transcript length of  <dig> bp at  <dig> k-mer was the best amongst all assemblies. we also evaluated the n <dig> value and assemblies performed at longer k-mers  had a better n <dig> value than the lower k-mer assemblies. highest n <dig> value of  <dig> bp was obtained in  <dig> k-mer assembly. an aggregate of approximately  <dig>  million contigs were obtained from all the assemblies. however, significant number of the contigs were represented in only one of the k-mer assemblies and were discarded thereby reducing the number from  <dig>  million to  <dig>  million. to further filter out the low confidence transcripts, we discarded the contigs that had less than one fragment per kilobase per million  in all the conditions . in this way, we clustered only those contigs which were present in assemblies of at least two different k-mer and on which at least one fragment out of one million sequenced reads mapped per kilo base. applying these criteria  <dig> contigs with an average length of  <dig> bp were identified . the aggregate length of all the assembled contigs was  <dig> bases. a large percentage  of the contigs was in the size range of 100– <dig> bp. as shown in figure 2a, the number of contigs decreased with an increasing size range .figure  <dig>

functional annotation of assembled transcripts
de-novo assembly followed by clustering resulted in approximately  <dig> contigs. any contig less than  <dig> bp long was removed from the clustered data thereby reducing the number of contigs to  <dig>  which were subsequently used for homology-based annotation. annotation on one hand helps in predicting the functions and on the other hand provides confidence about assembly approach. a substantial portion of the assembled contigs would be annotated as long as assembly approach is robust and adequate protein information of closely related species is available. these contigs hereafter referred as transcripts were searched against non-redundant protein database of embl  by using fastannotater tool  with an e-value cut-off of  <dig> . also, a query coverage threshold of 70% identity was used to discard low coverage/ambiguous homologous protein mapping. each transcript was annotated as per the best homologous protein and the corresponding annotation was assigned to it. based on the above approach 89%  of the transcripts were annotated whereas 11%  transcripts remained unannotated . a total of  <dig> transcripts had one or more protein domains based on information of pfam database . we were able to identify  <dig> unique pfam domains . blast  score revealed that highest number of transcripts matched to a. thaliana  and a. lyrata . the number of transcripts that matched with b. rapa or other brassica species were less than that of a. thaliana and a. lyrata . this observation is in accordance with the fact that protein resource of arabidopsis is much more comprehensive as compared to that of brassica species.

transcriptome analysis in response to high temperature and drought stress: quantification, differential expression and pathway mapping
we used fpkm  method to normalize the expression of identified transcripts across different conditions. to visualize the range of transcript abundance, log <dig> values of fpkm were used to construct box-and-whisker plot for each of the condition. as seen in the figure 3a, majority of the transcripts fall in the log <dig> fpkm range of 0– <dig>  however, many of the transcripts have log <dig> fpkm values higher and lower than this range. these transcripts are the outliers and are represented by black dots . it was observed that median and quartile values across bc, bhs and bds were almost similar. scatter plots drawn with the log <dig> fpkm values further corroborated the results obtained from box-plots. as seen in figure 3b, the fpkm values  in both control and stress samples are similar for most of the transcripts. to see how many transcripts are significantly regulated, volcano plots were constructed by plotting the fold change values against the negative log of p-values . the higher the negative log p-values, more is the significance of the regulation. in the center of the volcano is a line at which fold change is zero. on one side of the line are the negative fold change values indicating down-regulation and on the other side are the positive fold change values thereby indicating up-regulation. significantly regulated genes are represented by red dots. as has been shown by many previous studies, our data also follows the similar pattern that a small proportion of all genes are significantly regulated by abiotic stresses  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
estimation of normalization and expression changes in different libraries.  box-and-whisker plot of log <dig> fpkm values in rna-seq libraries of control , high temperature  and drought stress . the entire range is divided in  <dig> quartiles  each representing 25% of genes in the particular range.  scatter plot and  volcano plot of the transcriptome in high temperature  and drought  stress. in scatter plot, log <dig> fpkm values in control  have been plotted against log <dig> fpkm values of stress treated sample  sample. in volcano plot, statistical significance  has been plotted against log <dig> fold change .



to find out the differentially expressed genes fpkm values were compared in stress versus control conditions. a criterion of ± two fold change  was applied and  <dig> transcripts were identified that were regulated at least  <dig> folds in either high temperature stress and/or drought stress. out of  <dig> transcripts,  <dig> were regulated by both stresses whereas  <dig> and  <dig> were regulated specifically by high temperature  and drought  stress, respectively. upon imposition of stresses, majority of transcripts were down-regulated. out of  <dig> significantly regulated transcripts,  <dig> were down regulated,  <dig> of which were specifically down-regulated by high temperature stress,  <dig> by drought stress and  <dig> by both high temperature and drought stress. a heat map of differentially regulated transcripts is presented in figure 4a. the heat map clearly shows that a greater number of transcripts are down regulated as compared to up regulated transcripts. nevertheless, a lesser but substantial number of the transcripts were up regulated too, for example in bhs  <dig>  in bds  <dig> and in both bhs and bds  <dig> transcripts were up regulated . interestingly,  <dig> transcripts regulated by both bhs and bds displayed an inverse correlation in their expression with respect to these two stresses. details of differentially regulated transcripts are provided in additional file 5: table s <dig> figure  <dig>

we also looked into the pathways in which the differentially expressed genes are involved. we were able to map  <dig> genes in  <dig> different metabolic pathways . to further narrow down on the most significant pathways, we shortlisted the pathways in which at least  <dig> differentially regulated genes were present. based on the above criteria  <dig> significant pathways were shortlisted. the maximum numbers of differentially regulated genes  were present in ‘abc transporters’, followed by ‘ribosome biogenesis’ having  <dig> genes and ‘purine metabolism’ with  <dig> genes. a list of top  <dig> metabolic pathways possibly regulated by high temperature and/or drought stress is presented in table  <dig>  for each of the pathway, the hierarchical categorization of kegg  identifier in the form of kegg brite has also been included in the table.table  <dig>

gene ontology analysis of stress-regulated transcripts
for a broader classification, the entire set of  <dig> stress-modulated transcripts was subjected to gene ontology  analysis. nearly 40% of high temperature stress and 43% of drought stress regulated genes were associated with the go category ‘biological process’. similarly, 34% and 31% of the high temperature and drought stress regulated genes were linked with ‘molecular function’ category, respectively. further, 26% of genes regulated by either high temperature or drought stress were placed in ‘cellular component’ category. a significant number of transcripts  were categorized under the go number ‘go:0006355’ representing ‘regulation of transcription’. other apparent go terms associated with differentially expressed genes were ‘serine family amino acid metabolic process ’ and ‘protein phosphorylation ’. more than  <dig> transcripts associated with each of the above-mentioned go category. for each of the stress conditions, a few go terms, for example, ‘response to heat ’ and ‘response to high light intensity ’ were enriched in high temperature stress library. in case of drought stress treated library, the enriched go terms included ‘response to water deprivation ’ and ‘hyperosmotic salinity response ’. the composition of significant gos, having more than  <dig> differentially regulated genes, in bds and bhs samples is presented in figure  <dig> figure  <dig>

hormones play an important role in defining plant’s response to high temperature and drought stress  <cit>  and therefore, many go terms related to hormone signaling were enriched from the genes regulated by heat and/or drought stress. some of the enriched categories were ‘response to auxin stimulus ’, ‘response to salicylic acid stimulus ’, response to ‘jasmonic acid stimulus ’, ‘abscisic acid transport ’ and ‘response to gibberellin stimulus ’. approximately,  <dig> and  <dig> stress modulated transcripts from bds and bhs samples respectively, were associated with the top  <dig> go terms .

expression analysis of transcription factors and protein kinases
considering the functional importance of transcription factors and protein kinases, we identified  <dig> transcription factors and  <dig> protein kinases in the assembled b. juncea transcriptome . a large collection of transcription factor families and their members have been reported in arabidopsis  <cit> . similarly, we also discovered multiple members of transcription factor families in our data, including  <dig> transcripts belonging to myb family. other abundant transcription factor family members were from wrky , bhlh , ccaat , hsf , nfy , jumonji , ap <dig> , gata , erf , c2h <dig> , platz , bzip , dreb . amongst the protein kinases, maximum numbers of transcripts  were identified for receptor-like kinase family. beside these, map kinases , casein kinases , calcium-dependent protein kinases’ , cbl-interacting protein kinases  and cyclin-dependent protein kinases  were also represented abundantly in the assembled transcriptome data.

following identification of tfs and kinases, we ascertained their digital expression so that they can be catalogued on the basis of their modulation by stress. our analysis revealed that expression of  <dig> and  <dig> tfs changed by at least log2 ±  <dig> folds in response to drought and high temperature stress, respectively. additionally, expression of  <dig> tfs changed significantly by both the stresses . it was noticed that among the differentially regulated transcription factors in high temperature stressed sample most dominating category was of myb-transcription factors  followed by hsf  and erf . together these three classes of transcription factors represent 25% of all the transcription factors that were differentially regulated by heat stress. in case of transcription factors responsive to drought stress, myb transcription factors constitutes largest group  followed by bhlh  and wrky  transcription factor members. when we searched for the tfs, whose expression was significantly up-regulated, we observed that hsf family  and dreb family  were the predominant families in high temperature and drought stress, respectively. similarly, investigation of abundances of protein kinases revealed change in expression of  <dig> kinases with respect to their expression in control sample. among the various kinase families,  <dig> members of receptor-like kinase,  <dig> members of map kinase,  <dig> members of casein kinase,  <dig> members of calcium-dependent kinase,  <dig> members each of cbl-interacting kinase and cyclin dependent kinase families were regulated by more than two fold. moreover, out of  <dig> differentially regulated kinases,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were regulated by drought, high temperature or both stresses, respectively . these results indicate that heat and drought stress drive change in expression of many transcription factors and kinases which serve as key components of signal transduction pathways. some of these are regulated by both stresses while others are specifically involved in either heat or drought stress response. the number of differentially regulated transcripts of various transcription factor and kinase families is presented in table  <dig>  information about the individual transcripts can be found in additional file 9: table s <dig> and additional file 10: table s <dig> table  <dig>

validation of differentially regulated transcripts
from the list of significantly regulated transcripts, eight transcripts were selected for experimental validation and expression profiling. these transcripts include tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig>  tcons_ <dig> and tcons_ <dig> which were annotated as hsp <dig>  hsfb2a, hsfa7a, dreb2b, group  <dig> lea protein, polygalacturonase inhibitor protein  <dig>  sac-domain containing protein and senescence associated protein, respectively. as expected expression of hsp <dig>  hsfb2a and hsfa7a increased substantially and specifically in high temperature stress treatment whereas genes encoding for dreb 2b, group  <dig> lea protein and polygalacturonase inhibitor protein  <dig> were induced by drought stress. a significant increase in the expression of group  <dig> lea protein was also observed in high temperature stress. sac-domain containing protein and senescence-associated protein were inducible by both high temperature and drought treatment. the relative expression profiles of the above mentioned transcripts are depicted in figure  <dig> figure  <dig> 
relative abundance of selected transcripts as determined by qpcr. expression profiling of a few differentially regulated transcripts was performed using quantitative real time pcr. the relative abundance  was calculated using ΔΔct method. b. juncea seedlings were subjected for varied durations to either high temperature stress  at 42°c for 30 min, 2 h and 4 h or drought stress  by using 300 mm mannitol for 1 h, 3 h and 6 h. the mean of three independent biological replicates is presented.



discussion
ecological confinement of crops is determined by the climatic conditions prevailing in a niche. ever-increasing population and decreasing arable land is straining economies of the countries that are largely dependent on agronomic produce. multiple abiotic factors that act either in isolation or combination contribute to decrease in overall yield of crops. amongst abiotic factors, high temperature and water scarcity has an implacable effect on plant physiology and undermines the plant’s capability to sustain adequate grain production. to mitigate the effects of stress injuries, it is critical to contrive plants that can withstand environmental challenges. identification of molecular factors that either reinforce or provide ab initio abilities to combat these stresses is therefore of paramount importance.

the primary objective of this study was to visualize the landscape of changes occurring in transcriptome of b. juncea upon imposition of high temperature and drought stresses. here, we carried out paired end sequencing of rna-seq libraries prepared from poly a+ rna isolated from hydroponically grown 7-day old seedlings that were either grown under control conditions or subjected to high temperature and drought stress. high throughput sequencing generated more than  <dig> million purity filtered reads and nearly  <dig> million hq reads were de-novo assembled using soapdenovo assembler. assembly was performed at multiple k-mers and assemblies obtained from all the k-mers were clustered together. we adopted assembly at multiple k-mers primarily because of two reasons: firstly, many studies have shown that de novo assemblies with multiple k-mers result in discovery of greater number of transcripts  <cit>  and secondly it provides an opportunity to remove the contigs that are present in only one of the k-mer assembly, thereby increasing the confidence on the assembly. data assembled with multiple k-mers was clustered, followed by removal of singletons. subsequently, the resultant transcriptome was analyzed by assigning annotations, expression , gene ontologies and other functional categories. based on the digital expression data many transcripts regulated by either high temperature and/or drought were shortlisted.

we report the existence of more than  <dig> unique transcripts in indian mustard. however, a significant proportion of these unique transcripts were smaller than  <dig> bases. suspecting that these are artifacts of de-novo assembly, we discarded them to obtain  <dig> unique transcripts. the fact that a large number of assembled transcripts were annotated provides another support for the multi k-mer approach adopted for assembly. analysis of expression patterns of these transcripts revealed,  <dig> unique transcripts were responsive to drought stress and/or high-temperature. moreover,  <dig> transcripts were regulated  by both high temperature and drought stress. several studies have previously shown that some components are involved in more than one stress-signaling pathway  <cit>  and therefore functional characterization of the transcripts that are up regulated by both these stresses will shed light on the conserved signaling pathways in b. juncea. equally important are the transcripts that display an inverse correlation with respect to these stresses, as their characterization will help us unravel the reasons for their inverse regulation and functional significance.

of the genes identified in our study are the tfs like drebs, hsfs, wrkys, mybs etc. and calcium sensors, kinases, calmodulin-binding chaperonins, glutathione transferases, ascorbate peroxidases, ferritin etc. many of which have previously been implicated, in multiple abiotic stresses including drought and high temperature  <cit> . a detailed investigation of the digital expression data revealed that  <dig> and  <dig> genes were modulated specifically by drought and high temperature stress, respectively. as reported previously in multiple studies a majority of these genes were down regulated upon stress imposition indicating a general transcriptional repression  <cit> . of the  <dig> stress- modulated transcripts  <dig> mapped onto different metabolic pathways, the few significant of which included “abc transporters”, “purine metabolism”, and “two component systems”. components of the above-mentioned pathways are involved in abiotic stresses and therefore it is plausible that the b. juncea transcripts mapping to these pathways also play an important role in mitigating effects of abiotic stresses. at the center of abiotic stress signaling are tfs and kinases many of which are themselves regulated by abiotic stresses. our data reveals presence of  <dig> tfs and  <dig> kinases, out of which  <dig> tfs and  <dig> kinases were regulated by high temperature and drought stress respectively. the major up-regulated tfs in high temperature and drought stress turned out to be hsfs and drebs, which are the known biomarkers for these stresses, respectively.

in order to prove the authenticity of b. juncea de-novo assembly, we selected a few transcripts and validated them using quantitative real time pcr. three of the shortlisted targets were hsp <dig>  hsfb2a and hsfa7a, homologues which show a specific induction by heat stress. time kinetics studies of b. juncea hsp <dig>  hsfb2a and hsfa7a shows that these transcripts are induced many folds under high temperature  <cit> . moreover, the induction of the tfs hsfb2a and hsfa7a precedes that of hsp <dig> indicating a hierarchy in stress signaling. another transcript, which was validated by qpcr, was a member of group i lea protein that are known to accumulate in water deprived cells  <cit> . as expected expression of lea transcript increased nearly  <dig> folds under sustained conditions of drought. surprisingly, approximately, 10-fold induction of lea transcript was observed in high temperature stressed seedlings also. reports suggest that lea proteins can act synergistically with trehalose to prevent protein aggregation in vitro during high temperature  <cit> . in-vivo trehalose accumulates in plants subjected to high temperature stress  <cit>  and hence it is conceivable that the accumulated lea proteins act in conjunction with trehalose to in-vivo obviate the protein denaturation occurring during high temperature stress. polygalacturonase inhibiting proteins  are synthesized in plants to inhibit the activity of polygalacturonase enzyme secreted by phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . atpgip <dig> is inducible by cold stress  <cit>  and analysis of  <dig> different pgips revealed that abiotic stress responsive cis-regulatory elements are present in their promoters  <cit> . induction of pgip under drought stress in the present study thereby indicate that pgip is involved in multiple biological processes and may provide a link between drought stress mediated signaling and plant defense response. sac domain containing proteins were initially discovered in yeast and are believed to act as phosphoionositide phosphatases. arabidopsis has  <dig> sac domain containing proteins and atsac <dig> is inducible by salinity stress  <cit> . we believe that multiple sac domain containing proteins are present in b. juncea and induction of some of the members in abiotic stresses might be helpful in attenuating stress signaling by removing phosphate from phosphoionositides.

CONCLUSIONS
in present study we have utilized next generation sequencing and computational methods to decipher the genome-wide perturbations of steady state levels of transcripts in b. juncea seedlings subjected to high temperature and drought stress. we identified more than  <dig> transcripts out of which approximately  <dig> were differentially regulated. importantly, we also identified multiple tfs and protein kinases that were modulated by these stresses. these transcripts are components of important physiological processes, signaling/metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. stress responsive genes identified in this study will be useful in expanding our knowledge of high temperature and drought stress biology. the identified transcripts can be used to engineer tolerance against two of the most important abiotic stresses in b. juncea and related crop species.
