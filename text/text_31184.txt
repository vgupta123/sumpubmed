BACKGROUND
nac transcription factors belong to a large family of plant-specific transcription factors that are expressed in different tissues and at various developmental stages. the founding members of the family, nam from petunia and ataf <dig> and cuc <dig> from arabidopsis, were described in  <dig> and 1997
 <cit> , and the initials of these genes were used to derive the name for the newly discovered multigene family. to date,  <dig> nac genes have been identified in the arabidopsis genome
 <cit> ,  <dig> in rice
 <cit> ,  <dig> in maize
 <cit> ,  <dig> in sorghum,  <dig> in soybean and  <dig> in poplar but only around  <dig> in lower plants like mosses and spike mosses
 <cit> .

the characteristic feature of this group of transcription factors is the presence of a nac domain at the n-terminus
 <cit> , a stretch of ~ <dig> amino acids highly conserved between the members, which consists of five subdomains a – e
 <cit> . this region serves as a platform for dna binding, and for homo- or heterodimerizatzion with other nac proteins
 <cit> . determination of the nac domain structure revealed a novel transcription factor fold; a twisted β-sheet enclosed by α-helixes
 <cit> , which was recently shown to interact with the major groove of the target dna
 <cit> . the c-terminal region, in contrary, is variable in sequence and length and serves as a transcriptional activator
 <cit>  or transcriptional repressor
 <cit> .

nac transcription factors regulate a diverse range of processes in plants. the regulatory role of nacs in the development of plant organs like in the shoot apical meristem
 <cit> , the axillary meristem
 <cit> , the cotyledons
 <cit> , lateral roots
 <cit> , the xylem
 <cit>  or the secondary cell wall
 <cit>  has been intensively studied. in addition, it has been described that many members of the nac transcription factor family coordinate the response to abiotic stress. osnac <dig> and osnac <dig> from rice were shown to be induced by cold, drought and high salinity and to interact with each other and with a third rice nac transcription factor snac <dig> to induce the expression of stress-responsive genes. consequently, rice plants overexpressing osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  osnac <dig>  snac <dig> and snac <dig> were more resistant to high salt conditions compared to wild type rice plants
 <cit> . the expression of osnac <dig> was also strongly induced in rice roots by high salinity and osmotic stress. arabidopsis plants overexpressing osnac <dig> exhibited a constitutive upregulation of salinity-inducible genes and produced seeds that were more tolerant to both of these stress conditions
 <cit> .

furthermore, nac transcription factors are involved in the regulation of senescence in arabidopsis, where overexpression of atnap resulted in early senescence of rosette leaves
 <cit> , and in wheat, where low transcript levels of tanam delayed the onset of senescence
 <cit> . in addition, the arabidopsis nac transcription factor rd <dig> is induced by drought and aba and plants with reduced rd <dig> expression were insensitive to exogenous aba treatment, indicating a role of rd <dig> in aba-signalling
 <cit> .

in the past decade, nac transcription factors were also shown to be involved in the regulation of the plant defence network. for instance, the nac transcription factor ataf <dig> acts as a repressor of pr gene expression in arabidopsis <cit> , while ataf <dig> negatively regulates the defence response to necrotrophic fungi and bacterial pathogens
 <cit> . furthermore, anac <dig> and anac <dig> were involved in the ja-dependent expression of defence genes in arabidopsis
 <cit> . osnac <dig> and osnac <dig> were induced in rice upon challenge with the rice blast fungus m. grisea, and the overexpression of osnac <dig> led to increased resistance towards rice blast
 <cit> . finally, one potato nac gene was induced in leaves after inoculation with phytophthora infestans <cit>  and bnnac1- <dig>  bnnac5- <dig> and bnnac5- <dig> genes were found to be induced in oilseed rape during flea beetle colonization and sclerotinia sclerotiorum infection
 <cit> .

to date, data on the expression profile and possible function of maize nac transcription factors are limited. zmnam <dig>  and zmnam <dig>  are expressed in the shoot apical meristem during embryo development, suggesting that they play a similar role as their arabidopsis and petunia orthologues. transcripts of zmnac <dig> were detected in developing endosperm, while zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  putative paralogues, were expressed in the coleorhiza
 <cit> . transcripts of two other nac transcription factors, nrp- <dig> and apn- <dig> were found in the endosperm, the transcript of apn- <dig> was also detected in the developing embryo
 <cit> . a group of four nac transcription factors was shown to be involved in secondary cell wall biosynthesis in maize: zmswn <dig>  zmswn <dig>  zmswn <dig> and zmswn <dig> were able to complement the phenotype of the arabidopsis snd1/ nst <dig> double mutant, which lacks the secondary cell wall in xylem fibers. overexpression of each of these four maize nac transcription factors in arabidopsis wild type led to the ectopic deposition of secondary cell wall, resulting in a curly leaf phenotype similar to that observed for snd <dig> overexpressing plants, indicating that zmsnws are functional orthologues of snd <dig> <cit> .

although evidence for the involvement of nac transcription factors in plant defence accumulates, no such data are available for maize yet. therefore, our aim was to characterize two members of the nam gene family which we found to be induced in maize leaves challenged with colletotrichum graminicola. c. graminicola  wilson  is a causal agent of anthracnose leaf blight and stalk rot, an economically important disease of maize . the c. graminicola infection cycle starts on the leaf surface, where spores germinate. after germination, a specialized infection cell, the appressorium, is differentiated at the tip of the germ tube. the appressorium melanizes and accumulates compatible solutes to develop a high turgor pressure that is subsequently converted into mechanical force to piercing the plant cell wall with the penetration peg. within the host tissue, the fungus initially produces voluminous primary hyphae that grow biotrophically, i.e. without disrupting the host plasma membrane. this biotrophic phase lasts for approximately  <dig> days. subsequently, a switch to necrotrophic growth that involves both a change in lifestyle and hyphal morphology occurs. spreading of thin, fast growing necrotrophic hyphae, which rapidly colonize and kill the host cells, can be macroscopically observed as extending necrotic lesions. finally, the pathogen forms acervuli on the surface of the necrotic area, specialized structures mitotically producing conidia, which are distributed to new host tissue by rain splashes
 <cit> .

in this study, we provide a systematic nomenclature of the maize nac transcription factor family, which served as the basis to reveal that the two nacs that were induced in the maize – c. graminicola interaction and other defense-inducible nac from maize and other plant species are evolutionary related.

RESULTS
two maize nac transcription factors are induced in leaves infected with colletotrichum graminicola
in order to investigate which host genes respond to c. graminicola infection at the different stages of the interaction, we compared the transcriptome of leaves that were spray-inoculated with  <dig> ×  <dig> conidia/ml to mock-treated control leaves during the biotrophic phase at  <dig> hpi and after the switch to the necrotrophic phase at  <dig> hpi by microarray analysis . at  <dig> hpi, more than  <dig> genes were differentially regulated , of which  <dig> were upregulated in infected leaves. in this set, two genes encoding the putative nac transcription factors zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> were found, which were also induced during the necrotrophic leaf colonization at  <dig> hpi. to confirm the microarray data, transcript levels of both nac genes were assessed at  <dig> and  <dig> dpi by qrt-pcr . while zmnac <dig> transcripts were induced 4– <dig> fold, zmnac <dig> was induced 7-fold. as spray-inoculation only led to infection of a fraction of the epidermal cells, the induction of both nacs transcripts is likely significantly higher in the infected cells. to determine the induction kinetics at earlier time points of the interaction, we assessed zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> transcript amounts in dip-inoculated leaves, where the proportion of infected tissue is higher compared to spray-inoculated leaves . we employed both c. graminicola wild type  strain cgm <dig> and mutant strains generated by agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation , which are affected in virulence to different extent. while fungal penetration was reduced by 50% in mutant at <dig>  which is weakly affected in virulence , mutant at <dig> was unable to efficiently penetrate host tissue and was strongly affected in virulence . in wt-infected leaves, zmnac <dig> was weakly induced already at the pre-penetration stage at  <dig> hpi, but massive transcript accumulation coincided with the time of the establishment of biotrophy at  <dig> hpi . zmnac <dig> was also induced in the interactions with the two mutants at all tested time points and the expression level was positively correlated with the virulence of the employed strain . in contrast, the expression of zmnac <dig> was first induced after successful penetration of the wt and the mutant at <dig> strain into the host tissue at  <dig> hpi. in contrast, mutant strain at <dig> failed to induce the zmnac <dig> gene . the timing of infection was confirmed by microscopic observation of the infected leaves . our data demonstrate that zmnac <dig> is induced only upon successful penetration of c. graminicola into the host tissue, which suggests that this nac could be a part of the induced defence response. correlation of the expression level of both nacs genes with fungal virulence suggests that they could be a potential compatibility factors in the interaction of maize with c. graminicola.

zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> are induced by defence signals and during leaf senescence
as both zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> responded to biotic stress, we assessed their responsiveness to phytohormones involved in coordinating plant defence response and treated maize leaves with jasmonic acid or  <dig> -dichloroisonicotinic acid , an analogue of salicylic acid, or the ethylene precursor 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic-acid , a precursor of ethylene. both transcription factors were induced by jasmonic acid already  <dig> hours after treatment , and transcripts of zmnac <dig> accumulated further up to  <dig> hat . moreover, transcript accumulation of zmnac <dig>  but not that of zmnac <dig>  was enhanced by exogenously applied ina. these results suggest that zmnac <dig> is specifically induced by ja, and neither zmnac <dig> nor zmnac <dig> responded to ethylene . however, the induction of zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> during the compatible interaction with c. graminicola was approx. 100-fold higher as compared to the induction by ja and ina .

many nac transcription factors are involved in gene regulation during the senescence program , during which defense-related genes are also induced. transcript levels of both, zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> increased during leaf development and were about 4-fold greater in senescent leaves, as compared to seedlings .

zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> are downregulated during salt stress
some members of the nac transcription factor family, such as osnac <dig>  were described to have overlapping roles in response to both biotic and abiotic stresses
 <cit> . therefore, we have subjected maize plants to drought or high salinity conditions and evaluated the transcript level of the two nacs genes. both transcription factors were down-regulated during salt stress and the transcripts of zmnac <dig> also declined during drought stress . these results demonstrate that both zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> are distinctly regulated in biotic and abiotic stress conditions.

additional maize nac transcription factors are induced during the defense response
we further analysed, whether other maize nacs are also associated with the defence response. as shown by our transcriptome analysis, zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> were weakly induced during the necrotrophic stage of c. graminicola infection . from the four nac genes induced in the c. graminicola maize interaction, only zmnac <dig> was also upregulated in response to the fungal biotroph ustilago maydis <cit> . however, the induction of zmnac <dig> by u. maydis has only been observed at  <dig> hpi, prior to active defense suppression by the smut fungus
 <cit> . in addition, two other nacs, zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> were transcriptionally repressed in the interaction with u. maydis upon tumor formation at  <dig> dpi.

linear fold change values  of gene expression are given; negative values represent a down regulation. only fold changes >  <dig> are displayed. data were extracted from the microarray analysis of the maize transcriptome
 <cit>  and p-values  were calculated using bioconductor .

to identify the regulatory circuitry behind the observed regulation of nac genes in the two pathosystems, we have scrutinized the upstream promoter regions of the identified maize nac genes for the presence of binding motifs for defence-associated transcription factors to elucidate if certain promoter elements could confer the specific response towards c. graminicola or u. maydis. all promoters contained a core nac transcription factor binding site that had been predicted from the promoter element analysis of anac <dig> and anac <dig> <cit> . the entire nac-binding motifs identified for the two arabidopsis nacs could be found in all analyzed promoters in one to five copies, suggesting that other nac proteins could bind to the promotors of the analysed nacs as homo- or heterodimers . furthermore, the promoters of all except zmnac <dig>  contained binding sites for erf and tga transcription factors, which regulate the expression of target genes in response to ethylene or salicylic acid, respectively. a myc <dig> binding site, present in the promoters of many jasmonic-acid responsive genes, was found in zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  while a wrky-binding motif could be detected in zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  despite considerable conservation of erf, tga, myc <dig> and wrky binding motifs, the promoters of the six analysed nac genes differ in their individual motif composition. in the proximal region  <dig> bp upstream of the start codon, putative erf binding motifs were only present in zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  while all potential wrky binding sites were located in this proximal region. interestingly, a whirly-binding motif was found only in zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  the only members induced during the early interaction of maize with c. graminicola. in summary, the zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig>  zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> genes all contained potential binding elements for other transcription factors known to be involved in the plant defence network within the proximal promoter region.

the distance in base pairs from the respective start codon and the sequence of each element was given.

analysis of the family of maize nac transcription factors
the fact that promoter elements were quite conserved between the six analysed nac transcription factors prompted us to explore their evolutionary relation. using the unassembled maize genome information, shen et al.
 <cit>  identified  <dig> putative maize nac genes. since an assembly of the b <dig> maize reference genome became available
 <cit> , we analyzed the nac transcription factor family based on the assembled b <dig> genome information.

we employed the conserved nac domain of zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> as a query to search against the peptide database  deposited at http://maizesequence.org. moreover, gene models for putative maize nac transcription factors, deposited at grassius grass regulatory information server , were blasted against the assembled maize genome. as an outcome of both surveys,  <dig> putative maize nac genes  have been identified, which were renamed using the acronym zmnac and ascending arabic numbers due to chromosomal localisation as a suffix . multiple alignment performed on the whole set of putative nac protein sequences served for the construction of a phylogenetic tree, which revealed that the family can be divided into  <dig> clades . phylogenetic trees generated from the entire nac sequences  were very similar to those obtained from an alignment of the nac domains only , indicating that the nac domains allow for most of the distinction between individual clades.

an alignment of the consensus sequences generated for each clade revealed the typical domain architecture of the nac proteins. the n-terminal part of the proteins, which includes the nac domain, was well conserved between the clades, while the c-terminal region was highly divergent even between the members of the same clade . as described for the arabidospis and rice nac transcription factor families
 <cit>  and in two surveys using genomic information from  <dig> and  <dig> different plant species
 <cit> , respectively, five highly conserved subdomains a-e, separated by about 10– <dig> aa, have been distinguished in the nac domain . to identify consensus sequences of the subdomains a-e for all clades, the nac domains of all maize nac transcription factors were screened with meme . all clades except clade a shared common motifs  within the nac domain . more detailed analysis of these common motifs revealed that the conservation of each motif was higher within the same clade than in the comparison to other clades. as shown for subdomain d , single amino acid residues differed between the individual nac clades, except for clades c and d, which cannot be distinguished by subdomain d. a high similarity between the nac subdomains a, d and e was evident between clade a and the other clades, while the nac subdomains b and c were divergent. some nac proteins contained additional motifs in front of the nac domain. for instance, four members of the clade c shared one leading motif, while another leading motif was present in six members of the clade g and six nacs from other clades.
2: figure s <dig> 
3: table s <dig>  for the simplicity reasons, all proteins are aligned to one length. the term “variable” is used if more than three variants of the sequence are present at the respective spot, the absence of the given motif is marked with a dash.

in the c-terminal part of the protein sequences, in total twenty four distinct motifs  have been identified , some of which were specific to certain clades and subclades as described in the following paragraph. the c-terminus of clade f was distinct from all other clades. first,  <dig> of  <dig> clade members contained the qygapf motif , which is also present in six rice nacs , and in addition, two different kinds of long c-terminal extensions were present in these members. furthermore, subfamiliy g has even been divided into three subclades, based on the presence of motif syddiq  in subclade g <dig> and of motif nlddlq  in subclade g <dig>  which were both absent from the c-terminus of the third subclade. similarly, one subclade of clade e consisted of six members that all carried a long c-terminal extension that contained three different motifs: ars , idels  and kiwdwnp . furthermore,  <dig> members of four different subclades from clade c contained motif tdw  and lple . the latter motif is also present in the c-terminal domains of arabidopsis and rice nacs . finally, the  <dig> aa motif maaesnl  was specific for four members of clade a, which share between 83%  and 99%  homology and appear to be the result of recent duplications.

however, some motifs were shared between members of different clades. motif  <dig>  was present in five members of clades k and j and in some arabidopsis and rice nacs . furthermore, motif egspt  was common to members of clades f and k. motif qt  was shared between clades a, b and e, while motif hh/qhh  was common to members of clade x, b, c, d and e. the hh/qhh motif is also present in four rice nacs . some members of clade x contained motifs that were also found in clade a and b, respectively, which reflects the phylogenetic position of clade x between a and b.

clade g is enriched in defence-associated nac transcription factors
protein sequence comparison showed that zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> are closely related; sharing 78% similarity of the whole sequence and 87% in the nac domain. thus, these two transcription factors belong to clade g, as revealed by a phylogenetic analysis . checking the gene duplication data available for maize
 <cit>  further revealed that the two nacs have arisen from segmental duplication between long arms of chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig> . we were interested to know if the other maize nacs that were associated with defence responses towards the fungal pathogens c. graminicola and u. maydis  are related to zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  phylogenetic analysis revealed that zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> were also members of clade g, while zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> were divergent from all of the other five proteins, respectively . including all functionally characterized arabidopsis and rice nacs to the phylogenetic tree of maize nacs, we found that four arabidopsis defence-associated nacs also clustered into clade g . arabidospis ataf <dig> was reported to be involved in the defence response against bacterial pathogens and necrotrophic fungi
 <cit> , while the closely related ataf <dig> was shown to regulate the expression of pr genes
 <cit> . anac <dig> and anac <dig> were described to be involed in the regulation of the ja-dependent defence response
 <cit> . however, the two only rice nacs that are known to be involved in the response towards biotic stress, osnac <dig> and osnac <dig>  were found outside clade g . in summary, eight out of twelve defence-associated nacs from maize, rice and arabidopsis are members of clade g, while the four other were clustering to the separate families. as of our current knowledge, clade g seems to be enriched in transcription factors involved in response to biotic stress, suggesting that an ancestral nac of clade g might have acquired its role in defence regulation earlier than nac proteins from different clades of the family. however, this interpretation is limited by the functional characterization of orthologs of the relevant nac clades.

discussion
the involvement of nac proteins in the plant defence response network
in this study we have characterised two maize nac transcription factors; zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  which are induced during the interaction of maize with c. graminicola. the accumulation of zmnac <dig> transcript preceeded fungal penetration of the host tissue, suggesting that this transcription factor is activated as a part of the basal defence response. a similar induction pattern was described for the hvnac <dig> from barley
 <cit> , which was transcriptionally induced in epidermal cells shortly after inoculation with blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei . silencing of hvnac <dig> reduced penetration resistance and the number of papilla formed in response to fungal penetration
 <cit> . a deletion of ataf <dig> in arabidopsis, an hvnac <dig> orthologue, compromised non-host resistance to bgh, which was shown to be predominantly associated with papilla formation jensen et al.
 <cit> . based on these observations, the zmnac <dig>  hvnac <dig> and ataf <dig> orthologs are hypothesized to integrate the early transcriptional events upon pamp recognition during the basal defence response.

however, the highest accumulation of zmnac <dig> was reached upon successful penetration of c. graminicola into the maize tissue, while the transcription of the other maize nac transcription factor, zmnac <dig>  was exclusively induced during the post-penetration stage of the infection. these data further suggest that both transcription factors described in this study are also associated with induced defence responses at later stages of infection. induced defence reactions are controlled by phytohormones like jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene. we have revealed that both maize nac transcription factors described here are responsive to jasmonic acid, while transcription of zmnac <dig> was also enhanced by salicylic acid, indicating that both transcription factors are indeed involved in phytohormone triggered defence responses. similarly, it was shown that osnac <dig> and osnac <dig> from rice are strongly induced by methyl jasmonate, although transcripts of both genes accumulated to a similar level as during drought and cold stress
 <cit> . two arabidopsis genes coding for nac transcription factors, anac <dig> and anac <dig> were also responsive to methyl jasmonate, in a coi1- and atmyc2-dependent manner. moreover, studies with the anac019/ anac <dig> double knock-out and overexpression lines revealed that the expression of other ja-responsive genes, like vegetative storage protein  <dig>  and lipoxygenase <dig> , is regulated by anac <dig> and anac055
 <cit> , suggesting that these two nac transcription factors are part of a ja feedback loop. the promoter element analysis of six pathogen induced maize nac transcription factors in our study has revealed response elements for erf, wrky, tga and nac transcription factors within  <dig> bp upstream of the atg in five of the six analysed genes, suggesting an involvement of these five nacs in the transcriptional network controlling the plant defence response.

most nac transcription factors involved in plant defence are phylogenetically related
interestingly, ataf <dig>  hvnac <dig>  anac <dig>  zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> as well as the two other pathogen inducible maize nac transcription factors zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig> belong to nac clade g. taking our data and the recent analyses of rice nacs by nuruzzaman et al.
 <cit>  and zhu et al.
 <cit>  into account, almost two thirds of all studied defence-induced nac transcription factors belong to clade g. interestingly, this clade is one of three evolutionary ancient subclades and contains most of the moss and lycophyte nac representatives analysed
 <cit> . physcomitrella patens, the most ancient species harboring nac transcription factors, possesses genes of the oxylipin pathway like allene oxide synthase , allene oxide cyclase  and lipooxygenase . however, jasmonates have not yet been detected in this moss. nevertheless, it appears tempting to speculate that one of the first acquired functions of nac transcription factors might have been the perception of oxylipins since more than  <dig> million years ago, a time estimate, which is based on the analyses by zhu et al.
 <cit> .

the comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> nac transcription factor genes from  <dig> fully sequenced species of diverse evolutionary position by zhu et al.
 <cit>  has revealed  <dig> nac clades, of which  <dig> contain maize orthologs. in contrast, our analysis has revealed  <dig> nac clades. if we take into account that clade c in our analysis can be divided into two subclades and clade g can be divided into three subclades, our analysis has generated an equal number of discernible clades compared to zhu et al.
 <cit> . however, the number of clades described in the analysis of arabidopsis and rice nac transcription factors
 <cit>  deviates from study to study. this indicates that the diversity of the employed genome information determines the computation of nac clades due to the available number of protein sequences.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have identified six maize nac transcription factors that are induced upon challenge by fungal attack and in silico analysis revealed the presence of promoter elements that supports an involvement of five maize nacs in the defence transcription network. the two members that responded strongly to penetration by c. graminicola and that were studied in more detail, zmnac <dig> and zmnac <dig>  were predominantly ja responsive. we have generated a systematic classification of maize nac genes. on the basis of our phylogenetic analysis, we could reveal that the majority of those nac transcription factors that have yet been described to be involved in the defence network of higher plants are monophyletic.

in summary, our study adds to a number of previous reports on the involvement of nac transcription factors in the arabidopsis, rice and barley defence response. thus, an increasingly large number of nac transcription factors seems to be involved not only in the regulation of developmental processes and abiotic stress responses, but also in the regulation of biotic stress responses.
