BACKGROUND
the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis is responsible for the number one, non-viral sexually transmitted disease  worldwide  <cit> . there are ~ <dig> million new cases of vaginitis in the us alone  <cit> . trichomonosis causes serious health consequences for women, including preterm delivery, low birth weight infants, infertility cervical cancer, pelvic inflammatory disease and infection by other std agents  <cit> . trichomonosis also predisposes humans to hiv by increasing the portal of entry and exit of virus  <cit> . a recent study showed a relationship between trichomonosis and prostate cancer  <cit> . unlike other stds, the prevalence of t. vaginalis does not decrease with age  <cit> . given the significant human morbidity caused by t. vaginalis, there is an urgency towards identifying virulence factors, elucidating the mechanisms of pathogenesis, and developing interference strategies.

adherence by t. vaginalis to vaginal epithelial cells  is preparatory for colonization and infection. identification and characterization of five surface proteins  involved in attachment to vecs has provided an understanding, in part, of the molecular basis of host cell adherence by this parasite  <cit> . the adhesins interact with host cells via ligand-receptor interactions  <cit> . not surprisingly and as expected, there is a direct relationship between surface expression of adhesins and levels of cytoadherence  <cit> . all members of the adhesin gene families are coordinately up-regulated by iron  <cit> , and iron appears important for compartmentalization and surface placement of the proteins  <cit> . interestingly, the adhesins have sequence identity to metabolic enzymes located in the double membrane bound hydrogenosome organelle <cit> .

adding to the complexity of these proteins is the fact that the genes encoding the adhesins are members of multigene families  <cit> , which makes individual gene knockout approaches impractical for genetic-molecular studies. therefore, a recent study by us used antisense technology as a genetic approach to confirm the importance of the prominent ap <dig> adhesin in adherence to vecs  <cit> . in addition, as an alternative approach to confirm ap <dig> function we established a transfection system for heterologous expression of the t. vaginalis ap <dig> in t. foetus and showed surface placement of ap <dig> that led to higher levels of t. foetus attachment to vecs  <cit> . in this report, we demonstrate a role of ap <dig> in parasite adherence to the host cells by antisense inhibition of ap <dig> expression. furthermore, we show heterologous expression of ap <dig> on the surface of t. foetus, which elevated t. foetus cytoadherence.

RESULTS
plasmid construction and isolation of stable transfectants
we wanted to use the antisense approach to silence expression of ap <dig>  as before  <cit> . plasmid constructs containing the dna fragment representing the coding region of the ap33- <dig> gene  <cit>  in the sense  or antisense  orientations were generated. transfected t. vaginalis isolate t <dig> parasites were selected using  <dig> μg per ml g <dig>  and resistant s- and as-transfected trichomonads were cloned in soft agar. to confirm the presence of the plasmids in drug-resistant trichomonads, pcr was performed to amplify a 795-bp coding region of neo using template dna from wild type  organisms and s- and as-transfectants. as expected, figure 1a shows the neo pcr products in s- and as-transfected trichomonads harboring the plasmids. no pcr product was obtained from wt organisms.

antisense mrna modulates amounts of ap33
we next performed rt-pcr on total rna isolated from s- and as-transfectants and wt t. vaginalis as shown in figure 1b. results show the decreased intensity of the 580-bp pcr product of the ap <dig> coding region in the as-trichomonads compared to s- and wt organisms . in contrast, the primers to the control ap <dig> gene gave equal intensities of 500-bp rt-pcr product , and this confirms specificity in the antisense inhibition of ap <dig> and the use of equivalent amounts of total rna in the reactions. only the as-transfectants yielded a product from rt-pcr when specific primers were used to amplify a 525-bp product of the antisense transcript . as an additional control to show equal amounts of rna, rt-pcr was performed to obtain a 650-bp product with primers specific to the α-tubulin gene , which is constitutively expressed in trichomonads. finally, we performed the scion image β program to quantitate rt-pcr products. figure 1c shows an ~70% decrease in amounts of ap <dig> transcript  when compared to the wt organisms and s-transfectants. as additional controls to show that transfection alone had no effect on ap <dig> mrna levels, trichomonads were transfected with plasmid without insert and with plasmid carrying the ap <dig> antisense  <cit> . no effect on ap <dig> transcript levels by rt-pcr were seen for these controls. it is noteworthy that the primers used for rt-pcr of ap <dig> cross-hybridize with all three ap <dig> genes of the multigene family. therefore, as all three ap <dig> genes are expressed under these growth conditions and given the decrease in mrna by ≥ 70%, the rt-pcr data indicate that antisense rna expression decreases the amounts of endogenous transcripts of all three ap <dig> genes.

antisense decreased amounts of ap33
an immunoblot was performed using as probe monoclonal antibody  f <dig>  to ap <dig>  <cit> . as shown in panel  <dig> of figure 2a, the lanes with total proteins derived from equal numbers of wt  and s-transfected parasites  had readily detectable ap <dig> compared to as-transfected parasites . in contrast, the mab 12g <dig> to ap <dig> shown in panel  <dig> had equal amount of protein for each sample in duplicate blots of panel  <dig>  indicating that the effect of ap <dig> antisense rna is specific. in panel  <dig> the mab to α-tubulin reaffirms that equal amounts of protein was added to each lane and served as another internal control. figure 2b presents an immunoblot using mab f <dig>  to ap <dig> after a ligand assay to measure amounts of functional ap <dig>  there was decreased amounts of ap <dig> bound to vecs from extracts of as-transfectants  compared to wt  and s-transfected parasites . the amount of ap <dig> seen in lane  <dig> as determined by the scion image β program was decreased by ~70%. this extent of inhibition of both mrna seen above  and protein synthesis is evidence that all three ap <dig> genes were down-regulated in expression.

reduction in amount of ap <dig> does not affect parasite growth
because ap <dig> is β-succinyl coenzyme synthetase also localized to the hydrogenosome where atp is generated through the oxidation of pyruvate  <cit> , we felt it important to determine whether inhibition of expression of this gene affected overall parasite growth and multiplication. as illustrated in figure  <dig>  there was no difference in the growth rates between wt and as-transfected parasites nor was there any adverse effect on the viability and motility of trichomonads, as before  <cit> .

decreased surface expression of ap <dig> and lower levels of adherence by as-transfectants
immunofluorescence experiments were then performed to examine surface expression of ap <dig>  figure  <dig> demonstrates the decreased intensity of fluorescence by polyclonal rabbit anti-ap <dig> serum antibody characterized previously  <cit>  in the non-permeabilized as-transfected organisms  compared with wt  and s-transfected organisms  handled identically. these result are in agreement with data presented above on the decreased amounts of total ap <dig> in as-transfectants. under no conditions was any fluorescence detected using normal rabbit serum antibody as a control . furthermore, the level of adherence by as trichomonads was measured and found to be ~30% lower than wt and s-transfected parasites , and this decrease in extent of adherence is not unexpected given the availability of alternative surface adhesins, such as the prominent ap <dig> adhesin  <cit> , for cytoadherence. in separate control experiments performed simultaneously, trichomonads transfected with plasmid without insert and plasmid carrying the ap <dig> antisense had no effect on amounts of ap <dig>  as with the s transfectants, no decrease in growth and adherence was evident by trichomonads transfected with plasmid without insert. thus, these data suggest strongly that the effect was due to absence of surface ap <dig> and not to nonspecific events such as those that might result from transfection alone.

episomal expression of t. vaginalis ap <dig> elevates adherence levels in t. foetus
as before  <cit> , heterologous expression in t. foetus parasites is an additional approach for studying the function of t. vaginalis virulence genes. therefore, t. foetus were transfected with the s plasmid to generate a fusion protein containing hemagglutinin . stable transfectants were obtained and characterized, also as before  <cit> . episomal expression of ap33::ha was verified by rt-pcr , and synthesis of ap33::ha was demonstrated by immunoblot analysis using mab f <dig> . figure 6a  shows the higher molecular weight ap33::ha fusion protein band in total protein blots of transfected t. foetus, but not wt t. foetus . bands common to lanes  <dig> and  <dig> illustrate the crossreactivity by mab  <dig>  with the t. foetus equivalent protein. not unexpectedly based on our previous work  <cit> , the lower-sized bands in lane  <dig> detected by mab f <dig>  are degraded ap <dig>  duplicate blots were also probed with mab to ha , and as expected, this mab detected the fusion ap33::ha protein in transfectants  but not in wt t. foetus . the bands common to lanes  <dig> and  <dig> are nonspecific reactions by mab with t. foetus proteins. the absence of detection of lower-sized, degraded ap <dig> in lane  <dig> is because the mab is to ha, not ap <dig>  we then performed fluorescence on non-permeabilized wt and ap33::ha transfected organisms. as can be seen in figure 6c, the ha mab only detected t. foetus trichomonads expressing the fusion protein, again providing evidence for the surface placement of ap33::ha. finally and importantly and as before  <cit> , t. foetus transfected with plasmid without insert gave results in all assay identical to those seen for wt t. foetus.

lastly, we performed an adherence assay for t. foetus expressing ap33::ha. as can been seen in figure  <dig>  episomal expression of ap33::ha  had elevated levels of adherence to vecs when compared to background levels seen for wt t. foetus . levels of adherence was compared with those of t. vaginalis , which was normalized to 100%. importantly, the increased level of adherence was attributed to surface ap <dig>  as anti-ap <dig> antibody pretreatment of the transfectants  gave levels of adherence equal to wt organisms . these experiments reinforce the idea that ap <dig> indeed is surface expressed and involved in the property of trichomonal adherence to vecs.

discussion
our recent work with antisense rna-mediated inhibition of expression of ap <dig>  <cit>  coupled with the alternative approach of heterologous expression in the t. foetus trichomonad of ap <dig>  <cit>  provided additional confirmatory evidence for a role of this surface protein in t. vaginalis adherence to vecs. these approaches are important to obtaining experimental evidence on a functional role for trichomonad virulence factors, such as adhesins. this is especially the case when virulence genes are members of multigene families  <cit> , all of which are coordinately expressed  <cit>  and in which individual gene knockouts may be difficult or impossible to achieve.

we now undertook similar characterization of ap <dig>  as-transfectants decreased in ap <dig> mrna expression  had correspondingly less amounts of total and surface ap <dig> , which reflected lower levels of adherence to host cells . the fact that there was at best a 30% reduction in adherence to vecs in as-transfectants is not problematic. these trichomonads have four additional surface proteins  that provide redundant and alternative functions for adherence  <cit> . in fact, this extent of lowered levels of adherence is in agreement with previous data from inhibition experiments using anti-ap <dig> antibody and recombinant ap <dig>  <cit> . in addition, heterologous expression and surface placement of t. vaginalis ap <dig>  gave enhanced binding by t. foetus to human vecs , consistent with a recent report on heterologous expression of ap <dig> in t. foetus  <cit> . altogether, this data affirms a role for ap <dig> in trichomonal adherence to host cells.

it is important to point out that the mechanism is unknown by which antisense inhibits gene expression in trichomonads. in our earlier work  <cit>  and in this study we see decreased amounts of ap <dig> mrna and ap <dig>  as in other systems  <cit> , translation arrest or degradation of mrna following antisense-rna-mrna interactions may be occurring to account for the lower levels of ap <dig> transcript.

it was not surprising that decreased amounts of ap <dig>  did not affect overall trichomonal growth and multiplication  despite the fact that ap <dig> has sequence identity to a-succinyl coa synthetase . no effect on parasite viability and growth parameters was also evident upon down-regulation of ap <dig> expression  <cit> . it is known that the parasites are capable of surviving without the hydrogenosome enzymes. for instance, mr <dig> is a drug-resistant isolate  <cit>  lacking the adhesins-enzymes  <cit> , and these parasites are unable to cytoadhere to vecs  <cit> . indeed, parasites are capable of generating energy  through alternative metabolic pathways  <cit> .

recent reports  <cit>  have suggested that trichomonad lpg may also be a mediator of adherence to host cells. lpg mutants showed a decreased ability to cytoadhere. these findings may suggest additional mechanisms by which the parasite successfully colonizes the host. such redundancy is not surprising given the existence of multiple mechanisms by which pathogens target host cells and tissues  <cit> . in this report and an earlier paper  <cit>  we decrease synthesis of two protein adhesins by antisense and, as predicted, show concomitant lower levels of adherence. these latter findings are also consistent with the numerous reports supporting a role for surface proteins as adhesins  <cit> . in addition, recent work on the relationship between polyamine metabolism and putrescine secretion on t. vaginalis adherence and cytotoxicity  <cit> , while reinforcing the role of surface protein adhesins, illustrates the complexity of this adherence phenotype, which also involves host protein acquisition  <cit>  and cysteine proteinases  <cit> . this work  <cit>  establishes a testable hypothesis that has the potential to integrate the various adherence models. therefore, further work will be needed to fully understand how these seemingly distinct mechanisms of adherence are integrated.

CONCLUSIONS
these results using both antisense inhibition of gene expression and ap <dig> synthesis and the heterologous expression of ap <dig> in t. foetus confirms a role for this protein as an adhesin in t. vaginalis. further, it is clear that antisense technology and heterologous expression in a different trichomonas species are enabling experimental approaches to investigate and dissect the complex process of parasite adherence to host cells. this is especially crucial when other genetic approaches are untenable. notwithstanding the possible existence of additional adherence mechanisms, the available data continue to support a role for surface ap <dig>  and the other protein adhesins, in parasite recognition and binding to host cells.
