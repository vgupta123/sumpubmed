BACKGROUND
mastitis is an infectious disease of the mammary gland that has been considered as one of the most economically important diseases in the dairy industry for several decades  <cit> . mastitis can be caused by a variety of bacteria including gram-negative escherichia coli  and gram-positive staphyloccucus aureus   <cit> . the mastitis caused by e. coli and other gram-negative bacteria is often clinical with an acute and severe inflammation and the pathogens may be eventually cleared by the immune system within days or with antibiotic treatment  <cit> . in contrast, infection with gram-positive bacteria like s. aureus often causes mild mastitis and the clearance of the pathogens by antibiotics is often ineffective  <cit> .

efforts at mastitis control include understanding host response mechanisms to infecting pathogens and development of appropriate control strategies. transcriptomic as well as proteomic profilings have shown a marked difference in the response of host to e. coli and s. aureus bacteria. transcriptomic studies on bovine mammary epithelial cells in vitro challenged with mastitis pathogens and/or mammary gland tissues collected after intramammary infection revealed very different mechanisms in host innate immune responses to pathogens  <cit> . differential cytokines and chemokines  and other immune response proteins were also observed in bovine mammary epithelial cells and tissues or milk, in response to e. coli and s. aureus <cit> .

recently, an endogenous noncoding small rna known as microrna  has been shown to be involved in a wide variety of biological processes such as development, differentiation, apoptosis and viral infection. the role of mirna in the regulation of the innate and acquired immune response has been well reviewed  <cit> . it was shown that mir- <dig> promotes the production of tnf-α in human embryonic kidney cells , suggesting the positive role of mir- <dig> to modulate the release of inflammatory mediators  <cit> . recent studies on human epithelial cells infected by a protozoan parasite  revealed the up-regulation of let-7i or mir-27b. while let-7i directly regulates the expression of toll-like receptor  <dig>   <cit> , mir-27b targets kh-type splicing regulatory protein  to coordinate tlr4-mediated epithelial immune responses to pathogens  <cit> , indicating that mirna may act as a critical regulator in epithelial immune responses. in addition, it was suggested that mirna may modulate epithelial immune responses at every step of the innate immune network, including production and release of cytokines/chemokines, expression of adhesion and costimulatory molecules  <cit> . it has been clearly demonstrated that bovine mammary epithelial cells mount a robust immune response to the presence of bacterial pathogens  <cit> . however, how mirnas modulate this robust immune response by the bovine mammary epithelial cells to the presence of the mastitis pathogens, e. coli and s. aureus bacteria, is poorly understood. furthermore, studies elucidating the regulatory roles of mirna in bovine immunity and infection are few. a recent study using quantitative real time pcr technique revealed differential expression of five inflammation related mirnas  after stimulation of bovine monocytes with lipopolysaccharide  and s. aureus enterotoxin b  <cit> . using the same technique, four mirnas  out of  <dig> mirnas associated with regulation of innate immunity and mammary cell function were shown to be differentially regulated in bovine mammary tissue challenged with streptococcus uberis   <cit> . these studies suggest roles of mirnas in bovine mammary gland immunity but the extent of information is limited by the technique used. increasingly, more robust techniques like microarray and next-generation sequencing are finding applications in the elucidation of mirnas in immunity  <cit> . in particular, next-generation sequencing has the ability to profile the expression of both known and novel mirnas with high resolution and accuracy and to distinguish mirnas that are very similar in sequence as well as isomirs  <cit> . only two studies to date have used next-generation rna sequencing to study the regulatory roles of mirnas upon bacterial or viral infections in bovine  <cit> . using rna sequencing,  <dig> mirnas were detected as significantly differentially expressed upon infection of bovine primary epithelial cells with s. uberis, as well as a unique mirna profile in response to a gram-positive bacterial infection  <cit> . however, more information is needed to understand the roles of mirnas in modulating bovine mammary gland infections for their effective application as biomarkers of mastitis or as therapeutic agents.

to investigate the role of mirna in host defense to two mastitis pathogens, mirna expression in bovine mammary epithelial cells  challenged with heat-inactivated gram-negative e. coli stain p <dig> or gram-positive s. aureus strain smith cp bacteria were characterized by next-generation sequencing at different time points  following challenge and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or 48 hr without challenge. the next-generation sequencing technology allowed simultaneous detection of known and novel bovine mirnas, and global mirnas expression as well as pathogen directed differential mirna expression patterns.

RESULTS
mirna sequencing
thirteen small rna libraries were constructed and sequenced simultaneously. a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality reads were generated. among them,  <dig> , <dig> sequences ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides were obtained after adaptor trimming, accounting for  <dig> % of all small rna  sequences. alignment with mirbase  revealed that mirnas were highly enriched in all libraries. of the  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotide srna fraction, more than three quarters  of them were identified as known bovine mirnas, while only a small number  aligned to bovine trnas, rrnas and snornas. the remaining reads were other srnas including novel bovine mirnas , loop sequences of mirna precursors and sequencing artifacts . the majority of reads from srnas and known mirnas were  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides in length . dominant reads of srnas or known mirnas were  <dig> nucleotides in length , followed by  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> nucleotides, and lastly  <dig> nucleotides .

in total, we identified  <dig> known bovine mirnas with more than  <dig> counts per million  in at least one library. among them,  <dig> highly expressed mirnas accounted for  <dig> % of the total reads of identified known mirnas . the top five highly expressed mirnas were bta-mir-21-5p, mir-27b, mir-22-3p, mir- <dig> and let-7f, accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of total known mirna reads, respectively.

identification of novel mirnas and mirna candidates
with the high-throughput sequencing data, mirdeep <dig>  <cit>  generated a score for each known mirna and novel mirna. the score of  <dig>  yielded a signal-to-noise ratio of  <dig>   <cit>  and was used as cut-off for novel mirna prediction . a total of  <dig> novel mirna hairpins were identified . moreover,  <dig> hairpins with lower scores  but having more than  <dig> total counts were further analyzed and  <dig> or  <dig> of them were defined as precursors of novel mirnas or mirna candidates, respectively . although almost all mirnas have a variety of isoforms, most of the known mirnas detected or undetected by mirdeep <dig>  were within the size range of  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. moreover, a false precursor of bta-mir- <dig> predicted by mirdeep <dig>  contained a star mirna of  <dig> nucleotides in length, indicating that a precursor generating a short mirna may have a high false positive rate. therefore, precursors which form mature mirnas <  <dig> nucleotides in length were not further analyzed.

in total, five homologs of known mirna precursors from other animal species and ten reversely complementary to known bovine mirna precursors were identified to generate  <dig> novel mirnas . we also found an ortholog of bta-mir- <dig> . in addition, more than one third of novel or candidate mirna precursors  were found to be clustered together and have a high similarity to those of bta-mir- <dig> family in sequences . the remaining  <dig> novel mirna precursors were found to produce  <dig> mature mirnas which are less conserved to any known mirna in mirbase .

time effect on mirna expression in mac-t cells
considering that mirnas play roles in almost all biological processes, we hypothesized that the expression of mirnas might be regulated during the 48 hr incubation period of mac-t cells with or without pathogenic bacteria. the global expression of mirnas at different time points and under treatments were profiled and the correlations between libraries were performed with the normalized counts of all detected mirnas . the correlations between libraries were very high , suggesting that only a limited number of mirnas might be significantly regulated during the 48 hrs of cell challenge with mastitis pathogens. the lowest correlation was found between 0 hr and 48 hrs in control samples , indicating that the expression of mirna might be significantly regulated over time. therefore, differentially expressed mirnas between different time points and 0 hr in control cells were analyzed using deseq, an r/bioconductor package  <cit>  method to compare differential expression based on sequence counts. we observed that five mirnas  were differentially expressed  in at least two time points in control cells as compared to 0 hr . the expression of bta-mir-193a-3p was the most regulated over time, increasing lineally and reaching  <dig>  fold increase  within 48 hrs of cell growth. the expression of bta-mir-30b-5p and bta-mir-29c also increased over time but to a lesser magnitude as compared to bta-mir193a-3p. the expression of bta-mir-423-5p was highest at 6 hrs  and returned to 0 hr level by 24 hrs . conversely, the expression of bta-mir-423-5p and bta-mir-un <dig> decreased with time. the expression of bta-mir-193a-3p and bta-mir-423-5p in control cells was further validated by qrt-pcr. both mirnas were significantly up-regulated and reached a peak at 12 hrs, although no change larger than 2-fold was found between any two time points .

effect of pathogenic e. coli or s. aureus bacteria on mirna expression in mac-t cells
to determine the effect of e. coli and s. aureus bacteria on mirna expression in mac-t cells during the 48 hr incubation period, we compared the expression of mirnas at each time point to control samples at the same time point. the expression of  <dig> mirnas were differentially affected  by the presence of pathogenic bacteria in mac-t cells. within 6 hrs of the presence of e. coli, the expression of  <dig> mirnas in mac-t cells was significantly altered , three were down regulated  while three were up-regulated  . with time, the number of differentially expressed mirnas in the presence of e. coli decreased and by 48 hrs, only two mirnas were significantly altered. conversely in s. aureus challenged cells, only one mirna, bta-mir- <dig>  responded significantly to the presence of s. aureus bacteria in the first 6 hrs by showing a  <dig>  fold up regulation  as compared to control cells. furthermore, the expression of more mirnas became affected by the presence of s. aureus with increasing time . the three mirnas  that were significantly down regulated or one mirna  that was significantly up regulated within 6 hrs of e. coli presence only showed a retarded significant down regulation by  <dig> or 48 hrs  or up regulation  by 48 hrs in the presence of s. aureus. both pathogens presented significant up-regulation of bta-mir-21-3p at 12 hr  and 24 hr  post challenge. in contrast, the expression of bta-mir-21-5p, the other arm of bta-mir- <dig> and the top expressed mirna in this study  remained constant at these time periods . the most regulated mirna after infection was bta-mir-193a-3p . it should be noted that in most cases, different mirnas were differentially regulated at different time points indicating a rapid temporal change in the response pattern of mirnas to the presence of bacteria. furthermore, the differential expression pattern of five mirnas  were unique to e. coli while four  were unique to s. aureus. the expression of bta-mir-21-3p, mir-365-3p, mir-193a-3p, mir-423-5p and mir- <dig> in challenged cells was further confirmed by qpcr. the expression trends of these five mirnas were in most cases similar to results obtained by deep-sequencing . for example, bta- mir-193a-3p and mir-365-3p for e. coli at 6 h, mir-21-3p and mir-423-5p for e. coli at 12 h, mir-423-5p for e. coli at 24 h, mir-193a-3p for e. coli at 48 h, mir-21-3p for s. aureus at 24 h, and mir-193a-3p and mir-365-3p for s. aureus at 48 h were similarly differentially expressed  with both methods. surprisingly however, was the observed significant differential expression of all five mirnas in s. aureus challenged cells at 6 h with qpcr method as opposed to non-significant regulation with next-generation sequencing. similarly, different expression patterns of bta-mir-21-3p for e. coli at 24 h and s. aureus at 12 h, mir- <dig> for e. coli at 48 h and mir-423-5p for s. aureus at 12 h between the two methods were also observed.

enriched kegg pathways and go functional categories of predicted gene targets of differentially expressed mirnas in mac-t cells challenged with e. coli or s. aureus bacteria
target gene prediction of  <dig> out of  <dig> mirnas  differentially regulated by the presence of pathogens indicates that about  <dig> genes may be regulated by these mirnas . gene ontology  functional annotation showed that the target genes of differentially regulated mirnas were significantly  enriched in different functional groups, namely; cellular process, developmental process, localization, biological regulation, cellular component organization, cell death, multicellular organismal process, metabolic process, establishment of localization and cell growth . the highest involvement of target genes was of  <dig> mirnas in the cellular and developmental process followed by target genes of  <dig> mirnas in localization and of  <dig> mirnas in biological regulation. interestingly, several kegg pathways were significantly  enriched by target genes of  <dig> of the  <dig> differentially expressed mirnas . notably, pathways of the immune system, signal transduction, cellular processes, nervous system, development and pathways in human diseases, especially cancer were significantly enriched by target genes of at least  <dig> mirnas .

discussion
next-generation sequencing technologies have not only enabled the detection of more lowly expressed mirnas and novel mirna discovery, but also accurate profiling of the expression of mirnas at a high-throughput level. using deep-sequencing, we have identified a number of novel bovine mirnas and revealed a differential regulation of mirnas in mac-t cells challenged with e. coli or s. aureus bacteria, thus suggesting the regulation of mirnas in host response to these mastitis pathogens.

the number of mirnas deposited in mirbase has increased exponentially in recent years and high throughput sequencing has contributed to almost all sequences submitted to mirbase after  <dig>  <cit> . however, high throughput sequencing generates millions of reads per sample and requires powerful and accurate computational methods to mine known and novel mirnas. several computational software packages such as mirdeep  <cit> , mirena  <cit> , miranalyzer  <cit> , and mirtrap  <cit>  have been developed to identify mirnas from high-throughput data. our study used a combination of mirdeep <dig> and blastn and identified  <dig> novel mirnas in mac-t cells. it is notable that computational based approaches may over-predict novel mirnas and our data remain to be validated by further studies.

it is necessary to give a consistent and unique gene name for each novel mirna. the nomenclature of mirna has been well described previously  <cit> . however, the annotation of mirnas still presents misperceptions in some instances. some recently identified mirnas and their precursors are reversely complementary to previously known mirnas and precursors. for example, hsa-mir-103a and hsa-mir-103b  are paired  but are usually thought to be distinguished by  <dig> or  <dig> nucleotide differences in their nucleotide sequences. here we added a symbol “`” after mirna to represent the antisense of a known mirna precursor , i.e. hsa-mir- <dig> and mir-103′instead of mir-103a, b, respectively. in addition and to the best of our knowledge, there is no established criterion that defines conserved mirnas. we suggest that a novel mirna is homologous or orthologous if: 1) it precursor aligns to a known mirna precursor with > 70% identity and > 75% sequence coverage; or 2) it has > 90% identity and > 90% length coverage with a known mirna as well as same arm location on the precursor. previously, only sequence similarity was taken into account for the annotation of conserved mirnas and disparities have been known to occur. for example, bta-mir-193a  <cit>  , generated from bta-mir-193a- <dig>  is reversely complementary to bta-mir-193a-3p from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides but not correctly named. using this criterion, one mirna candidate identified in this study  was aligned to bta-mir- <dig>  un <dig> is at the same arm as bta-mir- <dig> on the precursor and therefore named as bta-mir-222b .

only a few mirnas  were highly expressed, accounting for  <dig> % of all known bovine mirnas detected. this observation is consistent with a recent study that detected similar mirnas expression levels in bovine primary mammary epithelial cells infected with streptococcus uberis and also, seven of the top expressed mirnas in that study  <cit>  are the same as in this study. most of the detected top expressed mirnas are conserved in human, mouse, and bovine, and belong to several mirna families, vis, mir- <dig>  mir-26a, mir-27a-3p/27b, let-7a-5p/7f/7i, mir-21-5p, mir-22-3p, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir221/ <dig>  in particular, several of these highly expressed mirnas are known to play roles in growth and immunity. the top expressed mirna, bta-mir-21-5p in this study, was also the most highly expressed mirna in human blood monocytes challenged with mycobacterium leprae and also found to negatively regulate the vitamin d-dependent antimicrobial pathway in leprosy  <cit> . mir-21-5p has been shown to be induced by lps and to negatively regulate tlr <dig> by targeting the programmed cell death protein  <dig>  and to promote the expression of interleukin  <dig>   <cit> . further evidence of the immune capacity of mir- <dig> was from the study of narducci et al.  <cit>  who provided in vitro evidence for involvement of mir- <dig>  mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in cell survival in sézary syndrome in humans. it has been recently shown that the level of immune and development related mirnas, including mir-27b, were significantly higher in colostrum than in mature milk  <cit> . up-regulation of mir-27b by lps was found to destabilize proliferator-activated receptor γ <dig>  mrna which is often associated with chronic inflammatory diseases  <cit> . in addition, mir-27b was reported to target ksrp and increase inos mrna stability for host’s defense against cryptosporidial infection  <cit> , further supporting a role for this mirna in immunity. therefore, the highly expressed mir-21-5p and mir-27b in mammary epithelial cells in this study might be associated with a function in immunity.

five mirnas were found to be significantly regulated during the 48 hr cell incubation without pathogens. it is not surprising owing to their involvement in almost all biological processes as demonstrated by go functional annotation of the target genes of three  of these mirnas. go functional annotation of target genes of bta-mir-193a-3p and mir-30b-5p showed enriched genes related to cell growth and death, e.g. growth arrest specific gene  <dig> , myeloid cell factor  <dig> , bcl2-like  <dig>  and programmed cell death  <dig> . gas <dig> has been shown to be involved in growth suppression through blocking of entry to s-phase and also prevents cycling of normal and transformed cells  <cit> . also, involvement of mcl <dig> and pdcd <dig> in the regulation of apoptosis and cell survival has been demonstrated  <cit> . it is well known that cells enter the stationary phase after reaching confluence. additionally, we used fetal bovine serum  free media, known to inhibit proliferation, during the 48 hr period of cell incubation. the up-regulation of mir-193a-3p and mir-30b-5p may play regulatory roles in cell death which need to be further confirmed in the context of mastitis.

out of the  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirnas identified in this study, only  <dig> showed differential expression after challenge of mac-t cells with e. coli or s. aureus bacteria, which may look small considering the large number of identified mirnas. it is probable that observed mirna expression profiles in response to heat inactivation of bacteria in this study may be different than expression elicited by live bacterial cells. in a recent study  <cit> , a substantially different mirna expression profile emerged from killed virulent bacilli as compared to live active bacteria thus suggesting an active influence of living bacteria on cellular mirna metabolism. however, our results on response to heat inactivated s. aureus are in line with literature information whereby  <dig> mirnas were shown to be differentially expressed after challenge of bovine primary mammary epithelia cells with live s. uberus  bacteria  <cit> . regardless, further studies on the mirna expression patterns during infection with live and active bacteria is necessary to verify the mirna expression variation identified between these two species. in addition, there were discrepancies in expression pattern of some low abundant mirnas during the infection detected by sequencing as compared to rt-pcr. this difference may be due to the pooling approach used for library preparation and subsequent sequencing, as well as the relative low sequence reads which may limit the proper detection of the low abundant mirnas by mirna-seq. furthermore, the mirna signature in different organs, tissues or cell types is different and also regulated differently. mirna expression profile has been shown to vary between mature milk and colostrum  <cit> , between lactating and non-lactating mammary glands  <cit>  and, between organs  and whole blood  <cit> . during the onset of mastitis and subsequent progression, the whole system reacts by recruiting immune cells into the mammary gland to help combat infection. these immune cells and other factors, including resident factors and cells in the mammary gland work in concert to ward off infection. it should be noted here that, the mammary epithelial cells used in this study only constitutes a small portion of that army of cell types that secrete defence factors against invading pathogens. thus, the present findings portray only the role of epithelial cells derived mirnas in the fight against mastitis pathogens, which may be different from the holistic picture that can be obtained after examination of all players. in profiling the transcriptome of s. uberis induced mastitis, fundamental differences were revealed between immune gene expression in the mammary gland and in a primary cell culture model thus demonstrating the complexity of the bovine mammary gland immune response to an infecting pathogen, and also indicating that a coordinated response exists between resident, recruited, and inducible immune factors  <cit> . furthermore, transcriptomics comparisons between mac-t cells and mammary tissue during late pregnancy and peak lactation showed a larger overall similarity in gene expression between mac-t cells and lactating than non-lactating mammary tissue  <cit> . despite these demonstrated differences  <cit>  and or similarities  <cit> , our results showed similarity between highly expressed mirna profiles with primary bovine mammary epithelial cells challenged with gram positive bacteria  <cit>  and non-challenged mammary gland tissues  thus indicating that the mac-t cell is still a valuable tool to study mammary gland biology. importantly, the findings from our study show the positive involvement of mammary epithelia cells in contributing to the immune response to infecting pathogens.

furthermore, our study has demonstrated that e. coli initiated a stronger response at the early hours of infection as demonstrated by the differential response of six mirnas within the first six hours of cell challenge with e. coli bacteria as opposed to only one differentially expressed mirna in the presence of s. aureus. by 48 hrs, two mirnas were differentially regulated in e. coli challenged cells while in s. aureus cells, more mirnas were implicated with time. furthermore, three of the mirnas that responded significantly to the presence of e. coli at 6 hrs post infection only showed a differential response in s. aureus cells by  <dig> or 48 hrs. interestingly, our study shows that a different set of five mirnas  were unique to e. coli bacteria while another set of four  were unique to s. aureus bacteria. our data therefore demonstrate a differential response pattern of mac-t cells to gram-negative e. coli, as compared to gram-positive s. aureus. mastitis caused by pathogenic ligands from gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria usually elicits different response patterns from the host thus leading to different degrees of mastitis. our data supports the intense immune reaction usually caused by e. coli mastitis, which often leads to acute mastitis. on the contrary, the slower initial response of mirnas to s. aureus bacteria may support the slow progression of mastitis caused by this type of bacteria. differential response patterns of mirnas to gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria have been demonstrated previously  <cit> . furthermore, our data is supported by previous studies that have demonstrated pathogen-dependent differences of host  responses to other immune factors   <cit> .

it is notable that predicted gene targets of most of the differentially expressed mirnas in response to pathogens in this study are significantly enriched for go functionally annotated roles like developmental process, cellular process, localization, biological regulation, cellular component organization, multicellular organismal process, cell death, metabolic process, establishment of localization and growth, thus supporting the involvement of these mirnas in numerous developmental and physiological processes, including disease development. this also goes a long way to portray the significant roles of mirnas in supporting the mammary gland in its growth and productive capacities as well as defense capabilities. interestingly, pathway analysis of mirna predicted gene targets, showed significant enrichments in kegg pathways already associated with host response to different diseases. notably, many of the kegg pathways significantly enriched by differentially expressed mirna target genes in this study have been previously associated to mammary gland responses to bacterial pathogens in bovine  <cit> . for example, gene targets of five differentially expressed mirnas  were enriched for pathways in immune system . these mirnas are amongst several mirnas with demonstrated roles in immunity. a recent study showed that the expression levels of three mirnas including mir-23a were significantly higher in breast cancer with lymph node metastasis, compared with that from patients without lymph node metastasis or normal tissue and also that the expression of the mir-23a/24-2/27a cluster promoted mammary carcinoma cell migration, invasion, and hepatic metastasis, through targeting sprouty <dig>  and consequent activation of p44/ <dig> mapk   <cit> . the mapk pathway was highly activated in mammary cells and tissues challenged with s. uberis <cit> . in addition, the role of let- <dig> mirna family in immunity is well established. the let- <dig> mirna family was identified as the common denominator of salmonella-regulated mirnas in macrophages and epithelial cells, thus suggesting that repression of let- <dig> relieves cytokine il- <dig> and il- <dig> mrnas from negative post-transcriptional control, thus establishing a paradigm of mirna-mediated feed-forward activation of inflammatory factors when mammalian cells are targeted by bacterial pathogens  <cit> . let-7b/d/e mirnas, were recently shown to be differentially regulated in infected  bovine mammary cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
using deep sequencing, we characterized the mirnome of bovine mammary epithelia cells  challenged with heat inactivated e. coli or s. aureus bacteria and detected  <dig> known bovine mirnas and  <dig> novel mirnas, and also a pathogen dependent differential regulation of mirnas. in particular, e. coli elicited an earlier differential regulation of mirnas as opposed to a delayed regulation by s. aureus. highly expressed and differentially regulated mirnas have demonstrated roles in diverse biological processes as well as in immunity. go and kegg pathway analysis showed significant enrichments of predicted target genes of differentially regulated mirnas in different functional groups  and kegg pathways of the immune system, signal transduction, cellular process, nervous system, development and pathways in cancer and other human diseases. importantly, our study provides further confirmation of the involvement of mammary epithelia cells in contributing to the immune response to infecting pathogens and a potential role for mirnas as biomarkers in early diagnosis of mastitis and in development of control measures.
