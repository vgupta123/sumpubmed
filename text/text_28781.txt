BACKGROUND
dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease of major public health importance worldwide. currently, the dengue pandemic affects more than  <dig> countries, including nations in africa, the americas, the indian subcontinent, southeast asia, the eastern mediterranean, and the western pacific  <cit> . the world health organization  estimates there are  <dig> million annual cases of dengue infection worldwide, about  <dig>  hospital admissions, and  <dig>  dengue-related deaths. globally, more than  <dig>  billion people are at risk for this disease. the emergence of dengue in the americas has been especially dramatic  <cit> .

dengue virus  is comprised of four closely related, but antigenically distinct serotypes , multiple genotypes enclosed in each serotype  <cit> . the aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for all four serotypes. the mosquitoes become infected after feeding on a viremic individual, then a reported eip of 7– <dig> days is required before the mosquitoes can transmit the virus to a new host  <cit> . environmental factors  as well as intrinsic factors  affect the eip  <cit> .

host organ and cell susceptibility and permissiveness condition virus tropisms in an organism  <cit> . a number of studies have investigated denv-vector interactions  <cit> , and the important role of virus genotype in efficient aedes aegypti infection has been revealed  <cit> . in this study, we wanted to determine the virogenesis of denv- <dig> infection in recently colonized vector mosquitoes from a dengue endemic area, which previously had been shown to be very susceptible to denv infection  <cit> .

in the natural course of infection for the virus, denv is ingested in a blood meal, then it encounters and must overcome midgut infection and escape barriers  <cit> , which vary among mosquito populations. infection of mosquito midguts is known to occur in a dose-dependent manner  <cit> . elucidation of the kinetics of replication and tropism of virus in recently colonized  aedes aegypti mosquitoes would provide a better understanding of transmission potential and vector-virus interactions that condition dengue epidemiology and epidemic potential. in this study, we determined: 1) the kinetics of denv infection in orally infected mosquitoes, 2) the denv- <dig> tropisms for different mosquito tissues and organs, 3) a possible anatomic explanation for virus dissemination from the midgut, and 4) the minimal time required for infection of salivary glands in recently colonized aedes aegypti mosquitoes from chetumal, mexico and in a long colonized or a selected aedes aegypti strain.

RESULTS
aedes aegypti mosquito susceptibility to denv- <dig> jam1409
the three aedes aegypti mosquito strains tested were susceptible to denv- <dig> jam <dig> midgut infection and dissemination, as determined by detection of denv- <dig> antigen in midguts and head tissues at day  <dig> post blood infection  . the midgut infection rates  were similar between chetumal  and d2s <dig> , while they were lower in rex-d  mosquitoes. the dissemination rates  in chetumal mosquitoes were greater  than in the laboratory-adapted rex-d mosquitoes . as expected, the greatest dissemination rates were observed in the d2s <dig> mosquitoes . an anova-one way analysis indicated that means were significantly different for mir  as well as for dr  among the three mosquito populations. the mir and dr between chetumal and d2s <dig> mosquitoes did not differ significantly.

denv- <dig> jam <dig> initial infection, replication, and modulation of infection in midguts
after ingestion of denv- <dig>  midguts were the first tissues to become infected. at  <dig> dpi, a few individual infected epithelial cells were distinguishable in ~30% of midguts. by day  <dig>  midgut infection foci involved multiple cells. infection spread laterally from this initial stage to the neighboring cells , frequently involving the entire organ by 7– <dig> dpi. then, starting at day  <dig>  but more noticeably at  <dig> dpi, the amount of viral antigen in the midgut began to decline. at  <dig> dpi viral antigen was almost undetectable, by either the polyclonal or monoclonal anti-dengue antibodies, in midguts of chetumal  and in rex-d control mosquitoes . in contrast, other organs and tissues, including fat body, salivary glands, and nervous system in the same chetumal mosquitoes contained large amounts of virus antigen during the time course.

denv- <dig> + sense rna as well as infectious virus in chetumal mosquito midguts was quantified by q-pcr and end point titration, respectively, at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. in this time frame, the viral rna remained stable  as determined by q-pcr . in contrast, between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi, virus titers decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> log <dig> tcid50/midgut  as determined by end point titrations .

presence of viral antigen in the tracheal system correlates with denv- <dig> dissemination in chetumal mosquitoes
analysis of mosquitoes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi revealed the presence of denv- <dig> antigen in portions of the tracheal system in  <dig> ± 5% of blood fed mosquitoes. the earliest detection of denv- <dig> antigen in the tracheal system occurred at  <dig> dpi, continued at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> dpi and then decreased notably. viral antigen was not detected through out the tracheal system; rather it was confined to small sections of trachea mostly from the abdominal area and it displayed a characteristic distribution pattern . the presence of viral antigen in trachea and virus dissemination out of the midgut in chetumal mosquitoes were strongly correlated at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi . this association was gone by  <dig> dpi  and thereafter . the criterion for disseminated infection was the presence of viral antigen in any organ or tissue other than the midgut or the tracheal system: early dissemination was detected most frequently in abdominal and throracic fat body, salivary glands and nerve cells and tissues. in contrast to the chetumal mosquitoes, viral antigen was rarely associated with trachea of infected rex-d mosquitoes.

denv- <dig> disseminates rapidly to salivary glands in chetumal mosquitoes
denv- <dig> was detected in the salivary glands of 36% of blood fed chetumal mosquitoes at  <dig> dpi. in the rex-d mosquitoes, this salivary gland infection rate did not occur until  <dig> dpi and at  <dig> dpi only < 15% of salivary glands of rex-d mosquitoes contained viral antigen. early on the infection, the distal region of the lateral lobes was frequently the area of the salivary gland to contain viral antigen; medial and proximal lobes became infected later. the cells in the distal lateral lobe may contain denv receptors or more receptors, but this remains to be determined. the percentage of infected salivary glands as well as the amount of viral antigen in the gland increased overtime, revealing a major denv- <dig> tropism for this tissue .

denv- <dig> tropisms for various tissues and organs in mosquito
the tropisms of denv- <dig> jam <dig> to organ-tissues other than midguts and salivary glands were determined over time in chetumal mosquitoes. denv- <dig> antigen was detected in head tissues at  <dig> dpi, and antigen continued to accumulate in these tissues throughout the eip. viral antigen was detected in fat body of the abdominal, thoracic or cephalic regions consistently throughout the time course. denv- <dig> dissemination to abdominal fat body was detected in  <dig> % of mosquitoes between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi  and in 62% of abdominal tissues at the other time points. thus, fat body represents a major site for denv- <dig> replication in the vector. interestingly the fat body also plays a key role in triggering the insect immune response against pathogens. hence, it would be important to determine potential effects of virus infection of the fat body on vector competence.

the musculature surrounding the midgut did not contain virus antigen at any of the examined time points in any of the mosquito populations included in our study . other organs and infected tissues included: trachea, esophagus , hemocytes , ommatidia of the compound eye , nerve tissue , and malphigian tubules . occasionally denv- <dig> antigen was observed in anterior midgut  and not in the hindgut  or cardia . taken together, these data revealed the general kinetics of infection and tropisms of denv- <dig> in mosquito as shown in figure  <dig> 

kinetics of denv- <dig> viral titers in chetumal mosquitoes
to establish the overall kinetics of denv- <dig> replication, viral titers were determined by plaque assay of individual mosquitoes at different time points . denv- <dig> titers increased over time and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  log <dig> pfu/mosquito. infectious virus was first detectable at  <dig> dpi. two slight drops in the overall viral titers were observed: one at  <dig> dpi and the other at  <dig> dpi. kinetics of virus replication during the denv- <dig> infection at various time points are shown in figure  <dig> 

discussion
each of the mosquito strains examined were susceptible to denv- <dig>  however, the chetumal and d2s <dig> strains were clearly more susceptible to denv- <dig> infection than the rex-d mosquitoes . denv- <dig> replication in infected rex-d mosquitoes was also slower than in chetumal mosquitoes . unfortunately, we did not have a long colonized strain of chetumal mosquitoes to compare to the newly colonized strain. colonization has been shown to select for certain genotypes in aedes aegypti  <cit> . thus the use of long-colonized mosquitoes as well as high passaged viruses from an area could confound the interpretation of the actual epidemic potential of denv in that area. it would be prudent to study vector-pathogen interactions using field-relevant mosquitoes as well as low passage viruses from a specific area in order to draw more precise conclusions about the risk of dengue transmission in that area.

it was surprising that the chetumal mosquitoes were as permissive to denv- <dig> productive infection as the d2s <dig> strain, which was selected for denv susceptibility  <cit> . the susceptible phenotype is likely conditioned by different genetic mechanisms, which remain to be determined. however, the results do confirm previous studies demonstrating that mosquitoes from the eastern portion of the yucatan peninsula  are remarkably competent vectors for denv  <cit> .

denv- <dig> infection was detected in midgut epithelial cells as early as  <dig> dpi. viral titers and virus antigen then increased until  <dig> dpi when both virus titer and antigen decreased . in contrast, q-pcr revealed that viral rna copy number remained fairly constant even late into the eip . conversely, denv- <dig> antigen was not cleared from salivary glands or neural tissues at equivalent time points. the former observation is of interest, because once a mosquito is productively infected with an arbovirus, she is capable of transmitting the virus for life. obviously, any virus modulation in the salivary glands would be epidemiologically significant since transmission efficiency could be reduced. modulation of virus in the midgut is provocative; either the virus or the epithelium is active in modulating the virus infection. the continued presence of denv- <dig> rna suggests a probable mechanism of persistence in vectors. denv- <dig> as other arboviruses can persistently infect insect and human cell lines and arthropod vectors  <cit> . it is unlikely that the modulation is conditioned by the metabolic activity of the midgut epithelium, because a second uninfectious bloodmeal provided  <dig> days after denv- <dig> infection of aedes aegypti failed to reestablish virus production in the midgut . the decline in infectious virus and viral antigen may be associated with an antiviral response, post-transcriptional or post-translational repression, or other self-limiting factors such as epithelial cells physiological status . further studies will be necessary to elucidate the molecular determinants of this phenomenon.

the mechanism by which denv disseminates from the midgut are not well understood. this study suggests that the mosquito tracheal system may be implicated in denv dissemination . the presence of virus antigen in tracheal system significantly correlated with denv- <dig> dissemination, mostly between  <dig> and  <dig> dpi. tracheoles are part of the tracheal system, are  <dig>  to  <dig> μm in diameter, are fluid-filled, and reach every tissue in the insect. the tracheal system has been reported to act as dissemination conduit for different viruses in insects. notable examples are autographa californica m nuclear polyhedrosis virus  infecting trichoplusia ni, nucleopolyhedrovirus infecting bombyx mori, and sindbis virus in aedes albopictus  <cit> . the tracheal system is also suspected to be the midgut escape conduit for venezuelan equine encephalitis virus  in ochlerotatus taeniorhynchus  <cit> . however, this is the first report indicating that denv may use the mosquito tracheal system during dissemination.

unlike a number of other arboviruses, denv displayed no tropism for midgut-associated  or flight muscles. rift valley fever virus infects both skeletal and visceral muscles  <cit> . sindbis virus replicates in visceral muscles of aedes albopictus  <cit> . west nile virus infects the contiguous muscles of the posterior and anterior midgut in culex mosquitoes  <cit> . the reasons for mosquito muscle refractoriness to denv are unknown and require further analysis. rift valley fever virus and sindbis alphavirus exhibit tropisms for cardia tissue  <cit> , while denv- <dig> was not routinely found in this tissue.

interestingly, denv- <dig> infection was detected in 36% of chetumal mosquito salivary glands by  <dig> dpi. in contrast, < 15% of rex-d mosquitoes had infected salivary glands at  <dig> dpi and salivary gland infection rates >36% weren't detected until  <dig> dpi. the chetumal mosquitoes would seem to be more vector competent than the rex-d mosquitoes. reportedly the eip for denv is between  <dig> and  <dig> days, and it can be affected by conditions such as temperature, humidity and viral dose  <cit> . blood meals provided to mosquitoes in our studies contained  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ×  <dig> pfu/ml, which is likely biologically relevant, since viremia titers of denv- <dig> in humans may vary from  <dig> to  <dig> pfu/ml or  <dig> to  <dig> tcid50/ml  <cit> . in our observations, the lateral distal lobes were frequently the first site to become infected in the salivary glands, the medial and proximal lobes developed infection later . this pattern probably results from the higher virus receptor concentration in this region of the salivary glands, but this remain to be determined. the lateral distal lobes participate prominently in the secretion of enzymes and proteins involved in hematophagy  <cit> , therefore infection of this region might promote early virus transmission. other studies have demonstrated that denv- <dig> can be transmitted by mosquitoes with < 25% salivary gland tissue infected, if infection occurred in lateral lobes  <cit> . thus, our results suggest that the eip for denvs may be shorter than the commonly reported . there is no sensitive and reliable laboratory animal model for dengue, and currently used in vitro assays for transmission may fail to detect small but transmissible amounts of virus at earlier times. however further studies will be necessary to demonstrate that infectious virus is being transmitted early in the eip and that the results can be extrapolated to low passaged denv strains.

a shorter eip for dengue would have important epidemiological consequences in dengue transmission. in nature, aedes aegypti female mosquitoes feed frequently and almost exclusively on humans, which confers greater fitness than feeding on other hosts  <cit> . these highly anthropophilic mosquitoes may ingest  <dig> to  <dig> bloodmeals during a single gonadotropic cycle, feeding with a frequency of  <dig>  to  <dig>  times a day  <cit> . aedes aegypti mosquitoes, with a very short eip, persistently infected salivary glands, and the ability to feed multiple times within a gonadotropic cycle, would seem to be the ultimate denv vector, which could help explain the epidemic potential of dengue.

CONCLUSIONS
the results with the recently colonized chetumal mosquitoes indicate that the eip for denvs may be shorter than the commonly reported, which could have important epidemiological consequences in dengue transmission. the mosquito tracheal system appears implicated in virus dissemination from the midgut, and viral infection in the vector is differentially modulated in different organs. denv- <dig> exhibits differences in certain tissue tropisms in its vector in comparison to other arboviruses in their respective vectors.
