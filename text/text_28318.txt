BACKGROUND
blending poly d-lactic acid  and poly l-lactic acid  with a determined ratio creates a stereo-complex of poly-lactic acid  with an increased thermal tolerance up to 230 °c  <cit> . this sc-pla could expand pla applications to agriculture-oriented and/or motor vehicle-associated plastics  <cit> . manufacturing of this sc-pla requires cost-effective production of optically pure d- and l-lactic acid isomers  <cit> .

glucose derived from corn starch is currently used for industrial l-lactic acid fermentation. this process, however, competes with food resources. an alternative non-food substrate such as cellulosic biomass should be used for cost-effective lactic acid fermentation  <cit> . the roadblock of this effort is that most lactic acid bacteria are unable to ferment xylose, a major constituent in the sugar stream of cellulosic biomass  <cit> . other strains, such as escherichia coli, with the ability to utilize hexose and pentose sugars have been engineered for the production of d-lactic acid . nevertheless, most studies reported the d-lactic acid production from glucose and/or sucrose by an engineered e. coli strain, with a titer, productivity and yield of 80–120 g l− <dig>  2–6 g l−1h− <dig> and 80–95 %, respectively. few of these strains, however, have the ability to ferment xylose into d-lactic acid with a desired titer, yield and rate  <cit> . furthermore, none, if any, of these strains have demonstrated the ability to co-metabolize both glucose and xylose for enhanced d-lactic acid fermentation.

like most bacteria, e. coli has a preference for glucose over other sugars for energy  <cit> . whenever glucose and other sugars are available, it will use glucose first, then other sugars only if glucose is completely consumed. this phenomena is often called the glucose effect or catabolite repression. the sequential use of glucose and xylose often results in delayed and incomplete use of xylose for lactic acid fermentation using sugar mixtures  <cit> . eliminating the glucose effect is needed to allow co-utilization of glucose and xylose for improved d-lactic acid production using cellulosic substrates  <cit> .

in this study, we report reengineering e. coli wl <dig>   <cit>  for d-lactic acid production by 1) replacing the l-lactate dehydrogenase gene  with a d-lactate dehydrogenase gene ; 2) eliminating catabolite repression via deletion of the ptsg gene that encodes for iibcglc, a major enzyme of the glucose pts system; 3) adaptive evolution in screw-cap tubes for improved cell growth with glucose as the sole substrate. the resulting strain, e. coli jh <dig>  is able to co-utilize both glucose and xylose for enhanced d-lactic acid production.

RESULTS
engineering of e. coli jh <dig> for optically pure d-lactic acid production
e. coli wl <dig>  a xylose fermenting homo-l-lactate producing strain previously engineered from e. coli b  <cit> , was used as the starting strain . although a one-step gene replacement  replaced by ldha ) in wl <dig> would allow the resulting strain produce d-lactic acid, the selection process will be complicated because the correct replacement  will have to rely on the fermentation and/or sequence results. to make a simple selection, a two-step strategy was used to allow plate selection. l-lactate production was first eliminated through deletion of the recombinant l-lactate dehydrogenase gene  using an ldha’-frt-kan-frt-ldha’ dna fragment. the ldhl gene was replaced by the kanamycin resistance marker  through double homologous recombination facilitated by the λ red recombination system  <cit> . the resulting strain, jh <dig> , lost l-lactic acid production as well as anaerobic cell growth due to the loss of l-lactate dehydrogenase, blocking nadh oxidation . nevertheless, it grows well aerobically on either glucose or xylose plates.fig.  <dig> engineering an e. coli strain devoid of the glucose effect for d-lactic acid production from a mixture of glucose and xylose. genes encoding important enzymes are indicated by italics. the relevant genes/enzymes are: ldhl, l-lactate dehydrogenase; ldha, d-lactate dehydrogenase; adhe, alcohol dehydrogenase; acka, acetate kinase; pflb, pyruvate formate lyase; frdabcd, fumarate reductase; glk, glucokinase; xyla, xylose isomerase; xylb, xylulokinase; xylfgh, xylose abc transporter; xyle, xylose/proton symporter; ptsg, subunit of glucose pts permease; ei-hpr-iia, phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase system; ac-p, adenylate cyclase; ~p, high-energy phosphate from a phosphorylated compound; crp, camp receptor protein; crp-camp, transcriptional dual regulator; galp, galactose transporter; mgl, galactose transporter. symbols: the stop and delta  signs indicated the relevant genes  were deleted



to enable d-lactic acid production as well as anaerobic growth, a d-lactate dehydrogenase is needed to reestablish a balanced nadh/nad redox  = >  <dig> pyruvate +  <dig> nadh  = >  <dig> d-lactate +  <dig> nad) . to this end, a d-lactate dehydrogenase gene  was amplified by pcr using the chromosomal dna of e. coli b as the template. the amplified dna fragment contained the ldha coding region flanked by 1460 bp upstream of the start codon and 600 bp downstream of the stop codon. this ~3 kb dna fragment was transformed into jh <dig>  through electroporation. through double homologous recombination, facilitated by λ red recombinase , this dna fragment was integrated into jh <dig> chromosome, replacing the kanamycin marker. the recombinant strain was selected through regaining anaerobic cell growth in screw-cap tubes and was tested by loss of kanamycin resistant. after curing the temperature sensitive plasmid pkd <dig> at 42 °c, the resulting strain was designated jh <dig> .

jh <dig> was evaluated for d-lactic acid production using 100 g l− <dig> of glucose, xylose or a mixture of glucose/xylose. as shown in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  glucose was converted into d-lactic acid in 28 h, achieving a titer of 85 g l− <dig> and a 90 % glucose-to-d-lactic acid conversion yield. a similar titer  and yield  was obtained in xylose fermentation . however, the maximal and average d-lactic acid productivity achieved in xylose fermentation  was ~1/ <dig> of that obtained in glucose fermentation . the lower rate of xylose consumption and d-lactic acid productivity is mostly attributed to its lower atp yield of xylose catabolism  compared to glucose catabolism   <cit> . nevertheless, with an extended fermentation time, complete xylose fermentation was achieved and resulted in a similar d-lactic acid titer as that of glucose fermentation.fig.  <dig> fermentative production of d-lactic acid by strain jh <dig>  a 100 g l− <dig> glucose; b 100 g l− <dig> xylose; c 100 g l− <dig> mixture of glucose and xylose. symbols: filled square, glucose; open square, xylose; filled circle, d-lactic acid. each data point represents the average of two or more replicates. the error bar represents the standard deviations

when tested in a 100 g l− <dig> mixture of glucose  and xylose , as expected, a sequential use of glucose and xylose was observed due to catabolite repression. as shown in fig. 2c, glucose was first catabolized into d-lactic acid. after 24 h, cells started to ferment xylose once the glucose was completely consumed. this delayed xylose utilization, as well as the lower consumption rate of xylose  compared to glucose , resulted in an incomplete xylose utilization, a lower d-lactic acid titer , and lower productivity  compared to that achieved in 100 g l− <dig> glucose fermentation  and xylose fermentation .

when tested for optical purity of the fermentation products, regardless of whether the fermentation substrate was glucose, xylose or a mixture of glucose/xylose, only a d-lactic acid peak was detected in the fermentation broth of jh <dig>  l-lactic acid, if present, was under the detectable level of hplc analysis using a chiral column and the standard d- and l-lactic acid isomers. nevertheless, an l-lactic acid peak was detected if external l-lactic acid  was intentionally added into the broth .fig.  <dig> hplc analysis of the optical purity of d-lactic acid produced by strain jh <dig> . no l-lactic acid peak was detected in the fermentation broth of jh <dig> . the l-lactic acid peak detected was the external l-lactic acid intentionally added into the fermentation broth 



eliminating the glucose effect/catabolite repression
catabolite repression in e. coli has been elucidated at a genetic level by others   <cit> . briefly, the transcription of xylfgh, xyle, and xylab genes encoding for xylose transporters and catabolic enzymes are positively regulated by the crp-camp complex. the formation of this activator is limited by the availability of camp. the biosynthesis of camp is catalyzed by adenylate cyclase , which is activated by phosphorylation via the pep-ei-hpr-iia phosphate relay. when glucose is present, ac is outcompeted by iicbglc  for phosphorylation. most, if not all, phosphate from the pep-ei-hpr-iia phosphate relay is used for iicbglc phopsphorylation, resulting in active glucose transport  rather than activation of ac. consequently, camp and crp-camp are not formed, resulting in no activation of the xylose utilization genes. when glucose is completely used, ac is activated by the pep-ei-hpr-iia phosphate relay, camp is made, and crp-camp is formed to turn on the xylose utilization genes.

to eliminate catabolite repression and allow co-utilization of glucose and xylose for improved d-lactic acid production, the ptsg gene encoding for the iicbglc was deleted from e. coli jh <dig> using a ptsg’-frt-kan-frt-ptsg’ dna fragment, resulting in strain jh <dig> . when tested by fermentation of glucose and xylose mixtures, jh <dig> co-utilized both glucose and xylose, suggesting that catabolite repression was successfully eliminated. nevertheless, in glucose, jh <dig> grew slower and achieved a lower final od <dig> than jh <dig> .

the pts system enables e. coli to use glucose as a preferred energy source because it allows glucose transport and phosphorylation to take place in one step. the resulting glucose-6-phosphate can enter glycolysis directly without further phosphorylation by glucokinase. with the disruption of the pts system by the ptsg deletion, jh <dig> will have to rely on an alternative system such as the galactose transporter, galp and mgl, for glucose transport. however, the galp and mgl system is much less efficient than the pts for glucose transport, resulting in slower anaerobic cell growth and glucose fermentation .fig.  <dig> metabolically evolved strain regained improved anaerobic cell growth. g) 20 g l− <dig> glucose nbs medium; x) 20 g l− <dig> xylose nbs medium; m) 20 g l− <dig> mixed glucose and xylose nbs medium. symbols: open circle, jh <dig>  initially engineered strain devoid of the glucose effect; filled circle, jh <dig>  metabolically evolved strain from jh <dig>  each data point represents the average of three replicates. the error bar represents the standard deviations



evolutionary engineering for improved cell growth and glucose utilization
to compensate for the loss of the pts system, jh <dig> needs an improved alternative glucose transporter. cloning a heterologous glucose transporter may or may not work for our strain improvement because most bacteria use pts system for glucose transport which may reintroduce the glucose effect into the strain. other non-pts system may still be inefficient for glucose transport. therefore, an evolutionary engineering approach was used for strain improvement. to this end, jh <dig> was metabolically evolved for three months via selection of improved cell growth using screw-cap tubes containing glucose as the sole energy source. in the end, a single colony was selected from the evolved culture and was designated as strain jh <dig>  the cell growth of the evolved jh <dig> strain was compared to that of jh <dig> in screw-cap tubes containing glucose and/or xylose as the energy source. as shown in fig.  <dig>  a lag growth phase of ~4 h, followed by a logarithmic growth phase of ~4 h  was observed for both strains regardless of whether glucose or xylose was used. during the logarithmic phase, however, the growth rate and cell mass achieved by the evolved strain, jh <dig> , was at least twice that obtained by jh <dig>  when glucose was used as the energy source . a similar pattern was observed when xylose was used as the energy source . the evolved strain jh <dig> grew better than jh <dig>  the growth difference of the two strains, however, was not as significant as that observed in glucose conditions. this result led us speculate that the improved cell growth of jh <dig> was mostly attributed to its improved glucose uptake via the galp and/or mgl system .

co-utilization of glucose and xylose enhanced d-lactic acid production
it was expected that jh <dig> would regain the ability of efficient d-lactic acid fermentation using glucose and xylose. to test this hypothesis, jh <dig> and jh <dig> were compared for d-lactic acid fermentation using 100 g l− <dig> of: 1) glucose; 2) xylose; and 3) a mixture of glucose  and xylose . as the results demonstrated in fig.  <dig> and table  <dig>  the evolved strain jh <dig> regained the fermentative ability for d-lactic acid production. in glucose fermentation, jh <dig> achieved a d-lactic acid titer of 88 g l− <dig> and a yield of 91 % , which is comparable to results obtained by jh <dig> . however, 36 h was needed for jh <dig> to complete the 100 g l− <dig> glucose fermentation; 8 h longer than the fermentation time needed by jh <dig> . the longer fermentation resulted in a 20 % lower productivity . this result suggested that the improved alternative glucose transporter in jh <dig> is not as effective as the original pts glucose transporter in jh <dig>  in xylose fermentation, the performance was similar for both strains , although jh <dig> had a 12 h longer lag phase than jh <dig> fig.  <dig> fermentative production of d-lactic acid by strain jh <dig>  a 100 g l− <dig> glucose; b 100 g l− <dig> xylose; c 100 g l− <dig> mixture of glucose and xylose; d 10 g l− <dig> mixture of glucose and xylose. symbols: filled square, glucose; open square, xylose; filled circle, d-lactic acid. each data point represents the average of two or more replicates. the error bar represents the standard deviations



a significant improvement of d-lactic acid production was achieved by jh <dig> in mixed glucose and xylose fermentation , compared to that of jh <dig> . both glucose and xylose were co-consumed by jh <dig>  allowing a 32 % higher total sugar consumption rate  than that of sequential sugar utilization by jh <dig> . consequently, the faster sugar consumption enabled jh <dig> to achieve a 33 % higher productivity  as well as a 20 % higher d-lactic acid titer  compared to that obtained by jh <dig> . furthermore, the 83 g l− <dig> d-lactic acid titer achieved in mixed sugar fermentation was comparable to that obtained in glucose  or xylose  fermentations.

although both glucose and xylose were co-consumed , jh <dig> had a lower xylose consumption rate  when glucose concentration was greater than 15 g l− <dig>  compared to that  when glucose was less than 15 g l− <dig> . nevertheless, the total sugar consumption rate  and lactate production rate  were similar regardless of glucose concentration or xylose consumption rate during these fermentation periods . these observations suggested that at a given lactate production rate, when both glucose and xylose concentrations were high  at early time, xylose was outcompeted by glucose due to its lower net energy output  than glucose , resulting in a lower xylose consumption rate . after 24 h fermentation, however, more xylose  was available than glucose . to achieve an equivalent lactate production rate, more xylose would be used to compensate the less available glucose, resulting in higher xylose consumption rate .

the observed different xylose consumption rate with different glucose availability led us to test whether both glucose and xylose were co-consumed by jh <dig> at lower sugar concentration. as the results shown in fig. 5d, jh <dig> was able to co-metabolize both glucose and xylose with a starting sugar concentration as low as 5 g l− <dig> 

furthermore, jh <dig> was tested for co-fermentation of glucose , xylose  and l-arabinose  in a simulated cellulosic biomass hydrolysate. as shown in fig.  <dig>  three sugars were co-metabolized, producing 81 g l− <dig> of d-lactic acid. nevertheless, there was approximately 4 g l− <dig> of l-arabinose were unutilized although both glucose and xylose were completely consumed.fig.  <dig> fermentative production of d-lactic acid in a simulated biomass hydrolysate by strain jh <dig>  symbols: filled square, glucose; open square, xylose; open circle, l-arabinose; filled circle, d-lactic acid. each data point represents the average of two replicates



CONCLUSIONS
an e. coli strain was engineered and adaptively evolved for improved production of optically pure d-lactic acid from mixed glucose and xylose substrates . the evolved strain, jh <dig>  is able to co-metabolize both glucose and xylose, resulting in an increase in the sugar consumption rate by 46 %, productivity by 48 %, and a d-lactic acid titer by 26 % compared to that of sequential utilization of glucose and xylose by jh <dig>  these results demonstrated that jh <dig> has the potential for d-lactic acid production using cellulosic substrates which contain both glucose and xylose. nevertheless, further improvements in productivity are needed for practical applications.
