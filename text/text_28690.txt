BACKGROUND
in sexually reproducing eukaryotes, the production of gametes relies on meiosis, during which a diploid cell is divided into four haploid cells. a critical step is homologous recombination between homologous chromosomes, in which both crossover and non-crossover events occur, resulting in a different gene content of the offspring chromosomes. this allows evolution to explore different allelic combinations through recombinations that are more likely to occur in some regions than others  <cit>  and that are initiated by dna double-strand breaks   <cit> .

the spo <dig> protein, a transesterase highly conserved through evolution  <cit>  and required for meiotic recombination in saccharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> , caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , drosophila  <cit>  and mammals  <cit> , causes dsbs. two spo <dig> proteins work in concert to cut both dna strands and, after the cleavage, each spo <dig> is bound to a dna fragment  <cit> . this property has been used to make a high-resolution dsb density map of the s. cerevisiae genome  <cit>  revealing that dsbs are more abundant before gene starts  <cit> . it is also known that dsb frequency is strongly correlated with gc-content  <cit> , open chromatin structure  <cit>  and histone methylation  <cit> .

a specific chromosomal structure is formed during meiosis, and plays a key role in recombination events. the formation of this structure is due to bonding of cohesin and several other proteins on specific dna sites, and to their assembly in a protein complex forming an axis  <cit> . the dna lying outside protein binding sites forms loops along the axis  <cit> . axes of homologous chromosomes are themselves bound to each other by transversal filaments made of  proteins, forming the so-called synaptonemal complex.

in s. cerevisiae, the structural axis is formed by cohesin , red <dig> and hop <dig> proteins  <cit> . it has been shown that proteins mer <dig>  rec <dig>  and mei <dig> bind to dna at axis sites, rather than to loop sequences, and that their association depends on red <dig> and hop <dig>  in turn, red <dig> deposition depends on rec <dig> cohesin in certain regions, but not in others, and in both cases, their local distribution is very similar  <cit> . the global correlations are r= <dig>  between red <dig> and hop <dig>  r= <dig>  between red <dig> and rec <dig>  and r= <dig>  between hop <dig> and rec <dig>  also, cohesin  density is higher in convergent regions, that is intergenic regions characterized by two gene ends, and is correlated with at-content  <cit> , but no specific cohesin-dna binding motif has been identified. red <dig> density is locally negatively correlated with dsb density .

many questions remain open on the chromosomal axis formation. can we model the accumulation of axial proteins and dsbs on the chromosomes entirely from genomic factors? if so, what is the contribution made by each one of them?

a number of genomic markers  associated to high-density sites have been highlighted by experiments  <cit> , but, once combined together, how well do they explain the frequency of occurrence of proteins or dsbs in a given site along the axis? in other words, can we create a mathematical model, based on genomic markers, and a tool that can predict axial proteins and dsb? with a rapid increase of sequenced genomes, it is highly desirable to develop automated methods for timely identifying recombination hotspots.

computational predictions of recombination hotspots have been based on nucleotide sequence content. these approaches take into account, more  <cit>  or less  <cit>  explicitly, sequence order effects. but the accuracy of these algorithms still needs further improvement and more formal mathematical approaches, considering mechanisms of chromatin remodeling during meiosis, could be a possible way to proceed.

here, we provide a mathematical framework, called spore for “spots of recombination”, that allows us to model axis proteins and dsb localization and density along chromosomes. spore models axis proteins and dsb distributions based on genomic information. for axis proteins, spore uses gene stop codon positions and gene lengths as its only input, while for dsbs, it uses the order of the genes defining intergenic regions, intergenic region lengths and gc-richness. based on these genomic markers, spore models s. cerevisiae experimental data for red <dig> and spo <dig> distributions  <cit>  accurately. we used spore to make predictions on three more yeast species, lachancea kluyveri, kluyveromyces lactis and schizosaccharomyces pombe. finally, we compared it to available tools predicting dsb hotspots and coldspots, and demonstrated its higher performance.

RESULTS
the model and the algorithm
spore modeling of axis proteins and dsbs relies on a general principle that can be summarized in two main steps . first, it defines a set of positions on the genome where proteins might accumulate, and sets a weight for each of these positions according to gene annotation. this weight is used as an indicator of the density of the proteins. in the second step, it makes a smooth curve using a gaussian kernel of the distribution of weights along the genome.figure  <dig> 
summary of spore modeling approach. two main steps constitute the approach and they are described from top to bottom . first, spore considers a set of positions to which it assigns weights. axis proteins  and dsbs  involve convergent genes and divergent genes, respectively. in the drawing, locations with non-zero weight are indicated by colored vertical bars  and triangles: convergent genes for axis proteins and divergent regions for dsbs display the highest weights . then, spore smooths the distribution of weights with a gaussian kernel  modeling, in this way, the diffusion of the proteins around their main sites. the red box on the left  and the blue box on the right  describe some details of spore models.



this main computational core in spore, takes as input a genome and its gene annotation, and provides as output the modeling curves describing dsbs and axis proteins distribution along the whole genome . a list of transcription factor binding sites  can be provided as input for more accurate promoter region detection. this intermediate output is used by spore to provide four kinds of data:  <dig>  it produces the curves modeling the density of dsbs and axis proteins along the whole genome, in a format that is ready for browsing .  <dig>  given a list of intervals on the genome, it predicts whether they are hot or cold spots for dsbs.  <dig>  given a list of intervals on the genome, it predicts whether they are axis sites.  <dig>  given an experimental curve defined over the genome, it compares the dsb and axis proteins model curves with experimental data and provides pearson and spearman local correlation coefficients between them. also, it compares the peaks of the model curves with the peaks of the experimental curve, computing ppv and sensitivity.figure  <dig> 
spore flowchart. spore takes several input files ; the input in the orange box is optional. spore implements the construction of the modeling curves for axis proteins and dsbs, as described in figure  <dig> , and uses these curves as input for  <dig> algorithmic tasks :  <dig>  the prediction of dsb hotspots. starting from a list of genomic regions, it decides whether these regions are susceptible to dsb or not;  <dig>  the prediction of axis proteins sites. as in  <dig>  it makes predictions starting from a list of genomic regions provided by the user;  <dig>  the production of ready for browsing output files describing the axis proteins and the dsb modelling curves ;  <dig>  the comparison of spore models  to experimental data .



spore can be easily used. it takes as input a genome and its associated gene annotation, and all its parameters are automatically computed on the input genome. also, spore works on scaffolds, not only on fully assembled chromosomes, since its minimal requirement is orf annotation.

analysis of convergent and divergent regions
our intuition on the positioning of high-density hotspots for axis proteins and dsbs was developed with the analysis of the s. cerevisiae experimental data in  <cit> . in understanding these data, we focused on convergent and divergent regions, instead of considering the start and the end of genes as previously done . the plots, reported in additional file 1: figure s2a-f, highlight characteristics of the data when displayed for convergent and divergent intergenic regions. notice that in  <cit> , it was already observed that meiotic cohesin preferably accumulates in convergent regions , with an extreme bias against regions in which transcription is diverging .

by focusing at convergent and divergent regions, we observe  that:

 <dig>  the local negative correlation between red <dig> and dsbs localizations observed in  <cit>  physically corresponds to convergent and divergent regions, where convergent regions present high average red <dig> density and almost no presence of dsbs , while divergent regions present a high average spo <dig> density and an important decrease in red <dig> ;

 <dig>  red <dig> density is much higher at gene 3’-ends than it is at gene 5’-ends, and yet even higher when we consider only convergent intergenic regions, having two gene 3’-ends ;

 <dig>  dsb density is twice as high in divergent regions, having two gene starts, than in tandem regions, that is intergenic regions between co-directional genes ;

 <dig>  dsb peaks are localized in promoter regions. this observation has already been made long ago  <cit> , and was confirmed with the high-resolution dsb density in  <cit> , in which the authors found that  <dig> % of dsbs overlap with promoters. this can be seen in the dsb distribution in large divergent regions . for the vast majority of intergenic regions , the dsb peaks appear roughly centered in the middle of divergent regions , this position well approximating promoter locations.

from  <cit> , we also observed that:

 <dig>  the shape of the distribution of red <dig> proteins along genes , highlights a linear increase of the amount of red <dig> proteins towards the gene end. on single genes this increasing distribution is not sharply distinguishable but when considering all genes together, it becomes gradually more pronounced in longer genes. in particular, the area under the distribution curves increases proportionally to gene length.

 <dig>  the distributions of rec <dig> and hop <dig> in intergenic regions have a shape similar to the red <dig> distribution .

axis proteins model
in a first attempt, axis proteins could be modeled by using gene 3’-ends as reference positions and by associating to each position a weight corresponding to the length of the relative gene. this simple model implies that convergent regions are governed by weights defined as the “sum” of two gene lengths, that tandem regions are modeled by the length of only one gene, and that divergent regions are ignored. it captures well some characteristics observed in s. cerevisiae experimental data: convergent regions host about the double amount of red <dig> compared to tandem regions, when we subtract the base noise level  and the amount of red <dig> at gene 3’-ends augments with gene length .

spore is based on this simple model but it also describes, in an explicit way, the spread of red <dig> proteins along the gene. this red <dig> spreading is likely due to two processes, one of diffusion and one of convection of proteins. since experimental measures of diffusion constants produced highly varying values depending on the organism and on the protein  <cit> , and that measures of convection constants are also organism and gene dependent  <cit> , we cannot directly use them to model the curves in additional file 1: figure s5a. then, we discretely approximated the curves through a linearly increasing curve that begins at the start of the gene and increases to its maximum value at the gene end, as in additional file 1: figure s5c. since we wish the amount of axis proteins per gene to be proportional to gene length, we set the “triangle” height to be the same for all genes. as a consequence, the area of the triangle is proportional to gene length, as described by experimental data .

the precise mathematical formulation of spore model is the following. first we define the raw curve before smoothing:  h=∑g∈g <dig> x−agbg−ag  where g is the set of all genes and x the position  on the genome, ag is the position of the start codon of g, and bg is the position of its stop codon. the function  <dig> has value  <dig> if x∈  and  <dig> otherwise.

then we apply a kernel-based smoothing with a gaussian kernel to h. namely, we compute the convolution with a gaussian kernel k to obtain the final function fred <dig> which is our red <dig> model curve:  fred1==∫−∞+∞h·e−22σsmooth <dig> dt  where σsmooth is  <dig> nucleotides.

dsb model
spore localizes dsbs in promoter regions. since these regions are not easily identifiable, spore follows a few rules to approximate their position in an intergenic region:  <dig>  if the region is convergent, then no dsb is supposed to occur in it,  <dig>  if the region is between two co-oriented genes , then dsbs are located at the center of the intergenic region, accounting for the promoter of the starting gene,  <dig>  if the region is divergent, then dsbs are located at two positions, at 1/ <dig> and at 2/ <dig> of the intergenic region respectively, corresponding to the two promoters. in cases  <dig> and  <dig>  the amount of dsbs is also modeled to be dependent on the average gc-content within a window . if tfbs are available, spore can use them to identify the promoter region of a gene and replace the location identified by steps  <dig> and  <dig> above with a more accurate evaluation of the promoter location.

spore adds one more contributing factor to the above model: the intergenic region length. for this, it makes sure that the contribution of very long intergenic regions would not be penalized by high weights, and fixes a maximum weight threshold to a value irlmax.

formally, spore modeling curve fdsb is defined as:  ∑g∈gmin·−gcmin))2·e−22σsmooth <dig>  where g is the set of all genes, x the position  on the genome, irlg is the intergenic region length before the gene . the position pg depends on both the orientation of g and the position of gene g′ preceding g; gc is the smoothed gc content at position pg. let  be the intergenic region and a be the start codon position of g, then:  pg=a+/2ifgandg′areonthesamestranda+/3ifgandg′areonoppositestrands 

the two thresholds irlmax and gcmin are defined as irlmax=μirl+σirl and gcmin=μgc−3σgc, where μirl  and σirl  are mean and standard deviation of the distribution of intergenic region lengths  over the whole genome. the quadratic term describes a preferred dsb concentration in regions with a higher gc content.

this model takes into account the observation that divergent regions host about the double amount of dsbs compared to tandem regions  and that, at large scale, on the thousands of base pairs scale, gc-content correlates with dsbs  <cit> .

comparison with experimental data
spore has been constructed to predict dsb and axis proteins distribution along chromosomes, and to measure the importance of different factors in this prediction. to evaluate how accurate spore modeling is, we performed four types of analysis:

a. experimental data on red <dig>  <cit>  and spo <dig>  <cit>  proteins obtained for the s. cerevisiae genome were considered and the local/global pearson and spearman correlations between spore modeling curves and experimental curves were computed. the distribution of peaks, characterizing sites of highest protein concentration, along the two curves was studied. several models, characterized by different combinations of genomic signals, were tested to numerically evaluate the impact of each signal.

b. coherence of spore predictions was tested on two experimental datasets  <cit>  related to axis proteins and dsbs.

c. spore was run on four yeast species.

d. spore was compared to existing dsb predictors, all based on machine learning  <cit> .

spore model and axis proteins in s. cerevisiae
spore model  is based on the hypothesis that axis proteins accumulate at the end of genes, that genic region length is the main factor for protein density, and that taking into account protein diffusion and convection along the gene improves precision. spore reaches average pearson local  correlation r= <dig>   and spearman’s local  correlation ρ= <dig>  . we note that lower correlations are obtained when an increasing distribution of proteins along the gene is omitted : pearson’s local  correlation is r= <dig>  , and spearman’s local  correlation is ρ= <dig>  .table  <dig>

local and global pearson and spearman correlation coefficients have been calculated between different model curves and s. cerevisiae experimental data for axis proteins  <cit>  and dsbs  <cit> . bold characters highlight best performance. different models are characterized by different weighting factors . for dsb analysis, gc is gc-content smoothed with a gaussian kernel of  <dig> nucleotides; irl is the intergenic region length, or irl

red <dig> localization is well predicted by the position of the peaks of spore modeling curve . for instance, along all chromosomes, 62% of real peaks are found by our model at a distance of at most Δ= <dig> kb from a predicted peak , and 62% of the predicted peaks are at most  <dig> kb away from a real peak . sensitivity and ppv at increasing Δ values are illustrated by the curve plot in figure 4a. we notice that random models, based on random selections of spots along the genome , give much lower ppv and sensitivity values.figure  <dig>

s. cerevisiae
. peaks localisation  in spore curves is compared to peaks localisation in experimental curves for axis proteins  <cit>   and dsbs  <cit>  . positive predictive value  and sensitivity  obtained with spore models  are reported for increasing values of the parameter Δ, representing the maximum distance allowed between two peaks to say that they match. the vertical bars in the plots correspond to Δ= <dig> kb and  <dig>  kb in a and to Δ= <dig> nt and  <dig> nt in b. different random models are used to analyze spore behavior : best ppv/sensitivity over  <dig> simulations , ppv/sensitivity for a p-value of 5% , average ppv/sensitivity over  <dig> simulations.



it is worth noticing that the usage of constant weights makes the model performance very poor, as the correlation with real data falls down to r= <dig>  . strictly speaking, even the positional analysis of the peaks, as discussed above, is dependent on appropriate weight values, because a smoothing is performed before extracting the peaks . therefore, peaks result from the accumulation of high weights and they are not simply modeling gene ends. this is why model  <dig>  has much lower ppv and sensitivity than model  <dig> 

finally, since experimental data highlight the existence of a background noise inducing a basic level of red <dig> distribution along chromosomes, we verified whether, by including a fixed noise level in spore model , predictions in s. cerevisiae would be improving the fit or not. a minor improvement in pearson correlation coefficients  is observed.

spore model and dsbs in s. cerevisiae
the spore model  assumes that dsbs concentrate in gene promoter positions, and that intergenic region length and gc-content are key factors for explaining dsb density. spore displays a local pearson correlation r= <dig>  and a spearman correlation ρ= <dig>  with experimental data  <cit> . the heatmap of the experimental spo <dig> distribution curve  <cit>  and the spo <dig> spore modeling curve, reported in figure  <dig>  shows a sharp diagonal confirming the accurate prediction of the model and in particular the precise prediction of regions with high dsb density or dsb absence.figure  <dig> 
heatmap of the experimental spo <dig> distribution curve [

] and the spo <dig> spore curve on the
s. cerevisiae
 genome. pairs of y-values belonging to the two curves have been recorded every 10nt along the chromosomes, and a total amount of about  <dig>  millions points  were identified, where y
 <dig> and y
 <dig> are the y-coordinates of the experimental and modeling curves, respectively. in the plot, the y-coordinates have been replaced by their ranks to allow for better visualization. the x-axis reports ranks from the experimental curve and the y-axis reports ranks from the spore modeling curve. each square in the plot describes the number of points falling into the corresponding interval of rank values. the dark red square on the top right collects picks with the highest y-ranks and the red square on the bottom left collects points in the experimental curve displaying no spo <dig> accumulation, and therefore no dsbs.



localization of dsb high-density spots is well predicted by the position of the peaks of our modeling curve . for instance, 64% of the predicted peaks are found at most Δ= <dig> nt away from a real peak  and 68% of the real peaks are found at less than  <dig> nt away from a predicted peak . sensitivity and ppv at increasing Δ values are reported in figure 4b. in comparison, a random model based on a random selection of spots in intergenic regions , displays much lower ppv and sensitivity.

although spore identifies a subset of the peaks found by the model at constant weights , it clearly predicts better their heights when gc-richness and, to a lesser extent, intergenic region length are considered. the performance of these different models is reported in table  <dig> 

finally, we tested whether the knowledge of tfbss in s. cerevisiae  <cit> , leading to a more accurate promoter region localization, improves spore predictions or not. there is no improvement on peak heights prediction . for peak localization, ppv slightly increases to 67% and sensitivity to 69% for Δ= <dig> nt, and we conclude that a precise estimation of promoter regions helps modeling dsb localization. the effect of tfbs availability in modeling remains limited though.

coherence of spore predictions with two large-scale experimental datasets
spore modeling curves can be used for comparison with experimental data of different origin. in this respect, we considered two different datasets.

first, as mentioned in the introduction, it has been shown previously that red <dig> and hop <dig> patterns are influenced by rec <dig>  patterns  <cit> . hop <dig>  for instance, is distributed almost like red <dig>  with which it interacts  <cit> . on the other hand, rec <dig> is more abundant around centromeres than red1/hop <dig>  although local variations are the same. therefore, rec <dig> global correlation with red <dig> is only r= <dig> , while its local correlation is still r= <dig> . because of these correlations, we expect spore to be locally well correlated with hop <dig> and rec <dig> . indeed, we find that spore model has a local correlation of r= <dig>  with hop <dig> and r= <dig>  with rec <dig>  compared to r= <dig>  with red <dig>  this confirms that the three axial proteins share spore local distribution patterns. consistently, if we look at global correlation coefficients, spore is well correlated with hop <dig>  and red <dig>  but weakly correlated with rec <dig> .

second, we compared spore curves to histone trimethylation data. it has been observed before that h3k <dig> trimethylation  is linked to dsbs  <cit> . then, we computed correlations between h3k4me <dig>  and spore modeling curve for spo <dig>  we find r= <dig> , which is comparable to r= <dig>  obtained when we correlate h3k4me <dig> and dsb experimental data. similarly, with spearman coefficients, we find ρ= <dig>  between h3k4me <dig> and our model, and ρ= <dig>  between h3k4me <dig> and dsb experimental data. we conclude that spore model is consistent with this known interaction.

both these examples confirm that the modeling curves are faithful approximations of experimental curves and that biological conclusions can be safely derived from them.

spore predictions on several yeast species
the large number of sequencing projects on yeast clades and the upcoming new projects  exploring the molecular biology of yeast species encourages the usage of predictive tools for learning about the distribution of dsb and axial proteins sites, to start comparative studies on yeasts across clades. we run spore on lachancea kluyveri and kluyveromyces lactis. the genome of l. kluyveri shows a particularly high gc-content on the left-arm of the c chromosome  and spore predicts a higher concentration of dsbs in this chromosomal arm. we note that the number of peaks within the c-left arm is comparable to other chromosomal arms, and that spore detects the same number of peaks  than model  <dig>  which excludes the gc factor. namely, the gc factor in spore exclusively influences dsb density and not dsb positioning, and the high number of dsbs predicted along the c-left arm is a consequence of spore higher peaks rather than spore higher number of peaks. experiments in l. kluyveri are expected to confirm spore prediction in the c-left arm of the c chromosome.

we have also run spore on schizosaccharomyces pombe where recombination is known to be partially dependent on dna motifs. as expected in this species  <cit> , spore predicts a large number of dsbs in large intergenic regions. it should be noticed that in s. pombe, divergent and tandem regions are unusually large compared to other yeast species. in s. cerevisiae, l. kluyveri and k. lactis for instance, the mean length of divergent and tandem regions, is approximately 700nt while it is 1200nt for s. pombe . since spore favors dsbs in tandem and divergent regions, and since the size of these regions plays an explicit role in the model, spore prediction confirms the previous observations.

when comparing spore predictions with the dsb distribution in s. pombe  <cit> , results are much less accurate than with s. cerevisiae. we get a local pearson correlation of r= <dig>  . spearman correlation is better with ρ= <dig>  . this can be explained by the major differences between s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. as explained by  <cit> , in s. pombe, dsb do not occur in most promoters and can occur in convergent regions. more precisely, in s. cerevisiae, 91% of divergent intergenic regions contain a dsb peak, while this number is only 70% in s. pombe. in s. cerevisiae the ratio between the number of dsb per kb in divergent versus convergent regions is around  <dig>  while it is only  <dig> in s. pombe. both these observations are in contradiction with our model, and that explains its poor performance for this species.

comparison between spore and other predictive tools
several tools, based on nucleotide sequence analysis  have been proposed  <cit>  as predictors of recombination or dsb hotspots.

we compared to the most recent one, irspot-psednc  <cit> , which improved above the others. in  <cit> , the authors compared their predictions of dsb sites against  <dig> hotspots on chromosome iv extracted from the same spo <dig> experimental data  <cit>  that we compared to. they found that their program predicts as hot  <dig> of these hotspots, corresponding to a true positive rate of 77%  <cit> . when applying the same test to our model, we predicted as hot  <dig> of these  <dig> hotspots, corresponding to a true positive rate of 80%. however, to perform a proper benchmark, negative instances  should be included in the test set, so that the false positive rate can also be measured. we therefore enlarged the dataset by adding  <dig> randomly chosen coldspots in the same experimental data and on chromosome iv . on this symmetric test set, the overall success rate of irspot-psednc falls to 54% against 85% for our model , compared to an expected 50% for a random prediction. this is due to the fact that irspot-psednc detects  <dig> false positives  while we only detect  <dig> of them . this shows that irspot-psednc is little better than random in detecting dsb hotspots. it should be noted that comparison is realized on hotspot sites localization but that no prediction on protein density is made by irspot-psednc, contrary to spore, where estimations of density can be directly inferred from the modeling curve.

we also extended this benchmark over the whole s. cerevisiae genome by considering all the  <dig> hotspots discovered in  <cit> , together with  <dig> randomly chosen coldspots. the accuracy of spore in that case is 84% . its predictive performance can also be measured with a roc curve by varying the density threshold, in which case the area under the curve is  <dig>  . irspot-psednc success rate on properly identifying hotspots and coldspots is 55% .

a second test was realized on the same dataset used in  <cit>  to compare irspot-psednc to idqd  <cit> . this dataset, defined in  <cit> , is composed of  <dig> hot orfs and  <dig> cold orfs, where the hot orfs describe a set of recombination hotspots. notice that a recombination hotspot is expected to be located close to a dsb site but not the vice versa, and that spore cannot be directly used for predicting recombination hotspots since it was designed to predict dsb hotspots.

hence, we decided to test how much the smoothed gc-content, which we used as a factor in spore, contributes to the identification of recombination hotspots. by using only gc-content, we obtained an accuracy of 83% , against the 80% reached by idqd and the 85% reached by irspot-psednc . the conclusion is that even though irspot-psednc is based on the actual dna content , it appears that almost all the signal can, in fact, be recovered simply with the gc-content in a window.

CONCLUSIONS
we explored the hypothesis that genomic signals allow us to predict dna double-strand breaks and the formation of the loops  in the 3d chromosomal structure during meiosis. our aim here is not to study the dynamics of a protein localization process but rather to identify the genomic information that can be used to predict the 3d structure formation and quantify the importance of these predictive factors. spore allows us to test whether genomic signals are good predictive variables or not, and to what extent, in the accumulation of axis proteins and dsbs along chromosomes.

however, it should be noted that this does not imply that the factors are the cause of dsbs and axis proteins positioning. for example, gc-content could be a consequence rather a cause of dsbs  <cit> . in both cases however, it is a useful factor for predicting dsb hotspots.

all genomic factors considered in the model are linear functions with the exception of a quadratic factor modeling the impact of gc content. new parameters can be easily added to the model for the evaluation of new genomic markers effects. the interest in this modeling approach comes from a straightforward biological interpretation of the parameters that helps to reason on plausible biological mechanisms forming protein accumulation.

orientation of genes and chromosomal axis formation
we have shown through a formal model that the distribution of the chromosomal axis proteins is encoded in gene organization along dna. the orientation of the genes influences the formation of the loops within the 3d axial structure during meiosis and to reach an understanding of this 3d structure formation, this fact should be combined with the existence of a random process governing the binding of the axis proteins to dna and with a pervasive transcriptomic activity inducing a repositioning of the proteins in specific sites along the genome. in this respect, spore model could help to design appropriate genomic signatures for synthetic chromosomes that should form a functional synaptonemal complex structure.

modeling organisms other than yeast
spore could be used to infer localization and density of axis proteins and dsbs sites at large scale for those yeast species for which whole genome experiments have not been made yet. today, more than  <dig> yeast genomes have been completely sequenced and for many of these yeast species, meiosis either exists or can be induced. it might be interesting to apply spore model to these species to check, through comparative genomics, whether syntenic region boundaries correspond to dsb hotspots or not across species, whether the genetic content of dsb hotspots and of their neighborhoods are conserved in different species and so on.

axial chromosome structures formation has been experimentally observed across many sexually reproducing eukaryotic species, from fungi to vertebrates. in yeast, our model highlights that axial chromosome structures and dsb distribution are governed by a rather simple combination of genomic signals. for other organisms, the model might be expected to become more complex. for the mouse, for instance, other factors such as dna binding sites targeted by axial proteins have been demonstrated to play an active role in dsb localization  <cit> . in this respect, spore might be taken as a nutshell to add extra signals and reach appropriate descriptions of experimental data in other organisms, possibly multicellular ones. spore software is provided to allow users for further development and testing of new genomic factors.
