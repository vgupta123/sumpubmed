BACKGROUND
glutenin proteins are the major factors responsible for the unique viscoelastic characteristics of wheat dough. they determine rheological properties and bread-making performance  <cit> . the polymeric glutenin proteins, with molecular weights ranging from less than  <dig> to more than  <dig>  kda, are composed of two groups of subunits. these subunits include the lmw-gs, which are similar in size and structure to the γ- gliadins , and the high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits  which range in molecular mass from ~ <dig> to  <dig> kda  <cit> . the lmw-gs represent about one-third of the total seed protein and ~60% of total glutenins  <cit> , and are essential in determining dough properties, such as dough extensibility  <cit>  and gluten strength  <cit> . hence characterization of allelic variation among cultivars and investigation of their relationships with end-use quality has been a key area of research on quality improvement during the last  <dig> years, and is the basis for the success of using specific lmw-gs alleles in breeding programs  <cit> .

the genes coding for lmw-gs are located on the short arms of homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes at the glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci, and are tightly linked to the gli- <dig> loci  <cit> . the glu-a <dig> locus on chromosome 1a encodes relatively few lmw-gs, with alleles glu-a3e in hexaploid or common wheat and glu-a3h in tetraploid wheat being null alleles that do not express any glu-a <dig> product  <cit> . in contrast, there is extensive variation for lmw-gs encoded by chromosome 1b in common wheat. the glu-d <dig> locus has less variability with five alleles reported originally by gupta and shepherd  <cit> , four alleles by lerner et al.  <cit>  and only three alleles observed by jackson et al.  <cit>  and eagles et al.  <cit> . nonetheless, recent studies using protein and pcr analyses have identified  <dig> glu-d <dig> alleles  <cit> , suggesting that a reexamination should be carried out to clarify the genetic variability at this locus.

despite the abundance of the lmw-gs, they have received much less attention than the hmw-gs, probably due to their complexity, heterogeneity and co-migration with gliadins in sds-page  <cit> . in the sds-page system, utilizing gliadins as indicators provided an indirect way to define lmw-gs alleles  <cit> . the 2-de analytical process that could generate much more information than sds-page  <cit>  was not generally recommended for use in breeding programs, due to its time-consuming procedure, high costs and skill requirements. maldi-tof-ms is currently the most efficient method to analyze proteins and requires only 4- <dig> minutes per sample. it is a high throughput technology for analyzing wheat gluten proteins  <cit> , but being relatively new and expensive, few wheat breeding programs can afford to acquire such equipment. recently, a simple, rapid and sensitive pcr approach, has proven to be a very useful tool for identifying lmw-gs composition in common wheat  <cit> .

lmw-gs were first identified by gel filtration and starch gel electrophoresis of extracts of wheat flour  <cit> . they were classically subdivided into b, c, and d groups , according to their electrophoretic mobilities in sds-page and their isoelectric points   <cit> . based on the locations of cysteine residues involved in the formation of intermolecular disulfide bridges, ikeda et al.  <cit>  classified lmw gene sequences into six types, each containing several different groups based upon differences in their n- and c-terminal acid-amino compositions. altogether,  <dig> groups were differentiated, but an additional five groups were reported by juhász and gianibelli  <cit> .

the allelic nomenclature system for the lmw-gs was defined through the chromosomal location of the dna coding regions by gupta and shepherd  <cit>  and was reviewed by jackson et al.  <cit> . branlard et al.  <cit>  proposed a schematic presentation of sds-page relative subunit mobilities to characterize the different alleles encoded at glu-a <dig>  glu-b <dig> and glu-d <dig> loci. ikeda et al.  <cit>  recently compared glu- <dig> allele identifications from five laboratories, confirming inconsistencies between laboratories in identifying glu- <dig> alleles due to differences between the separation and identification methods. the study also indicated new glu- <dig> alleles in a number of the cultivars analyzed.

the n-terminal sequences of lmw-gs were used to divide the protein subunits into two main groups  <cit> . the first group corresponded to typical lmw-gs, i.e., lmw-i  and lmw-m  types, and the second group, named gliadin-like sequences  <cit>  as these subunits have n-terminal sequences similar to α-, γ- and ω- gliadins. most gliadins are monomeric, but some have an extra cys that allows them to be incorporated into glutenin polymers. payne  <cit>  termed the prominent bands observed by sds-page of reduced glutenin protein as a , b  and c . later, other researchers also observed larger gliadin-like subunits, between the a and b bands, and they named them as d- subunits  <cit> . most of the b- subunits were shown to possess i-, m- or s  -type n-terminal sequences  <cit> . c- subunits including α-, and γ- gliadins-like subunits as well as subunits with classic lmw-gs sequences occur in large numbers, although their relative amounts are lower than those of b- subunits. similarly, d- subunits have n-terminal sequences that correspond to ω- gliadins, another type of gliadin-like sequence  <cit> .

the use of two distinct nomenclature systems, one based upon the relative mobilities in sds-page and the other upon n-terminal sequences, make it extremely difficult to compare work from different laboratories. the main ambiguities from these different classification systems can be summarized as follows: 1) at the glu-a <dig> locus, both glu-a3a and glu-a3c were reported for the same cultivar, and similarly, glu-a3a, glu-a3b, glu-a3c, glu-a3d were reported to be identical to glu-a3e; 2) at the glu-b <dig> locus, results differed for glu-b3b and glu-b3g, and for glu-b3f and glu-b3g in the same cultivars; and 3) at the glu-d <dig> locus, there was ambiguity between glu-d3a and glu-d3c, and between glu-d3a and glu-d3b in the same cultivars  <cit> . as a consequence of these problems, reports of correlations between certain allelic forms of lmw-gs and quality parameters in common wheat have often been contradictory  <cit> . it is, therefore, essential to establish a simple and uniform classification through a set of standard cultivars for each lmw-gs allele.

in  <dig>  a cooperative program was developed among the following five laboratories to establish such a set of standard cultivars for identifying lmw-gs alleles: chinese academy of agricultural sciences , international maize and wheat improvement center , national institute for agricultural research , national agriculture and food research organization , and national university of the center of the province of buenos aires . a set of  <dig> cultivars used in various previously studies  <cit>  in  <dig> countries was assembled and distributed to all laboratories, including murdoch university as an additional laboratory, for the identification of lmw-gs alleles. their preliminary glu- <dig> allelic assignments were summarized in a previous paper  <cit> . the objectives of the current paper are 1) to compare the lmw-gs compositions obtained by sds-page, 2-de, maldi-tof-ms and pcr in order to clearly identify the protein compositions of cultivars in the collection; and 2) to establish a set of standard cultivars for the identification of lmw-gs alleles, enabling information regarding the effects of individual lmw-gs on gluten properties to be readily and continuously shared between laboratories and applied in breeding programs.

RESULTS
analysis of lmw-gs by sds-page
the lmw-gs compositions identified in participating laboratories by sds-page were combined and listed in table  <dig> ; discrepancies among different laboratories were discussed by ikeda et al.  <cit> . at the glu-a <dig> locus, alleles glu-a3a, glu-a3b, glu-a3c and glu-a3f could be readily identified using sds-page . alleles glu-a3d and glu-a3g could be differentiated with the aid of the gliadin sds-page gel; by the presence or absence of the gli-a1o allele, which we believe is linked to glu-a3d, but not to glu-a3g . it was difficult to distinguish glu-a3f from glu-a3e . in previous studies  <cit>  both alleles tended to be detected as glu-a3e.

characterization of lmw-gs by 2-de
the identification of the lmw-gs alleles by 2-de was consistent between the two laboratories. the discrimination between lmw-gs alleles in the collection by high resolution 2-de is illustrated in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and the results are shown in table  <dig>  the glu-a <dig> alleles glu-a3d ), glu-a3e ), glu-a3f ) and glu-a3g ), were readily differentiated on the basis of protein spots with clearly different molecular masses and pi. alleles glu-a3a ), glu-a3b ) and glu-a3c ) had identical pi but different molecular masses, making it possible to discriminate between them.

at the glu-b <dig>  the alleles glu-b3ab ), glu-b3ac ), glu-b3h ), glu-b3ad ) and glu-b3j ) were easily differentiated by protein spots having different molecular masses and pi. alleles glu-b3ab ), glu-b3ac ) and glu-b3ad ) were each discriminated from glu-b3b ), glu-b3g ) and glu-b3i  by two distinct protein spots. although the majority of the protein spots for alleles glu-b3b and glu-b3g had identical molecular masses and pi, they could be discriminated since allele glu-b3g had one additional spot, at ph <dig>  located between the hmw-gs and gliadins. there were no obvious differences in molecular mass or pi between alleles glu-b3d ) and glu-b3i , or between glu-b3f  and glu-b3g ), making differentiation by 2-de impossible.

at the glu-d <dig>  only glu-d3c ), glu-d3l ) and glu-d3m ) could be definitely identified by 2-de. allele glu-d3l ) had two more distinctive spots compared to glu-d3c ) in 2-de separations. as expected, alleles glu-d3c and glu-d3e  could not be separated by 2-de. these alleles appeared to be the same based on sds-page and maldi-tof-ms in the present study as they were in a previous study  <cit> .

2-de did not distinguish glu-d3a ), glu-d3b ) and glu-d3d , hence further investigation should target discrimination of glu-d <dig> alleles by combining 2-de with other methods such as pcr.

identification of lmw-gs by maldi-tof-ms
the compositions of lmw-gs analyzed by maldi-tof-ms are presented in table  <dig>  as shown in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the spectra of lmw subunits analyzed by this method consist of complex sets of peaks, consistent with the extensive diversity of the subunits. the lmw-gs exhibited molecular masses of 25- <dig> kda in maldi-tof-ms spectra, considerably lower than the corresponding molecular masses of 42- <dig> kda determined by sds-page and indicative of limitations of the sds-page method in determining the molecular masses of lmw glutenins  <cit> . two major regions with masses from  <dig> to  <dig> kda and from  <dig> to  <dig> kda were separated in spectra of maldi-tof-ms . these regions correspond to the c- lmw-gs and b- lmw-gs classified by sds-page. the region with molecular masses of 30- <dig> kda also corresponds in mass to the major gliadins range  <cit> . the results were in agreement with previous studies based on sds-page, where there were extensive overlaps between gliadins and lmw-gs with lower molecular masses  <cit> .

maldi-tof-ms-based identification of lmw-gs alleles was established using a set of  <dig> near-isogenic lines  of cultivar aroona . most of the distinct peaks of the glu-a <dig> alleles exhibited higher masses in the ranges of about  <dig> - <dig>  kda and  <dig> - <dig>  kd, whereas the distinct peaks of the glu-d <dig> alleles showed lower masses of  <dig> - <dig>  kda. the middle masses in the ranges of about  <dig> - <dig>  kda and  <dig> - <dig>  kda corresponded to the glu-b <dig> alleles. the distributions of distinct peaks of the glu- <dig> alleles in the maldi-tof-ms were in agreement with their position in sds-page  <cit> .

compared to the other loci, glu-a <dig> was less diverse and most protein bands had lower mobilities, so discrimination between them using sds-page is usually feasible. similarly, most of the distinct peaks of the glu-a <dig> alleles were well separated in maldi-tof-ms spectra, and alleles glu-a3b ), glu-a3d ), glu-a3e ) and glu-a3f ) were reliably discriminated.

the glu-b <dig> alleles glu-b3a ), glu-b3b ), glu-b3c ), glu-b3h ), and glu-b3j ), as well as seven other alleles, were readily distinguished by maldi-tof-ms.

with regard the glu-d <dig> locus, maldi-tof-ms clearly differentiated the glu-d3a ), glu-d3b ), glu-d3c ) and glu-d3m ) alleles. as expected, glu-d3e  could not be discriminated from glu-d3c ). improved discrimination will be achieved as calibration technology improves. in addition, it may be of value to utilize the close linkage between gliadin and lmw glutenin alleles to further improve the power of maldi-tof-ms in differentiating lmw glutenin alleles.

detection of lmw-gs by allele specific pcr markers
seven primer pairs  <cit> , including glua3a, glua3b, glua3ac, glua3d, glua3e, glua3f and glua3g, were used to identify glu-a <dig> alleles . the amplified fragment sizes for each marker were  <dig> bp for glu-a3a,  <dig> bp for glu-a3b,  <dig> bp for glu-a3d,  <dig> bp for glu-a3e,  <dig> bp for glu-a3f, and  <dig> bp for glu-a3g, indicating that the glu-a <dig> alleles in the collection could be readily distinguished from one another. since no glu-a3c allele-specific primer has been developed, identification of this allele required the use of the glua3ac with a  <dig> bp band in combination with the marker glua3a  <cit> .

ten primer pairs developed by wang et al.  <cit>  were utilized to test for glu-b <dig> alleles and the results are summarized in table  <dig>  specifically amplified fragments included  <dig> bp for glu-b3a,  <dig> bp for glu-b3b,  <dig> bp for glu-b3c,  <dig> bp for glu-b3d,  <dig> bp for glu-b3e,  <dig> bp for glu-b3g,  <dig> bp for glu-b3h, and  <dig> bp for glu-b3i, indicating that the glu-b <dig> alleles could be well differentiated based on corresponding markers. detection of glu-b3f required the use of the glu-b3fg marker with an 812-bp marker in combination with the glu-b3g marker since no glu-b3f allele-specific marker has been designed. although glu-b3f could not be clearly distinguished from glu-b3g by protein based methods, these alleles could be definitively differentiated by pcr. in addition, there were obvious differences between genes glub3- <dig> and glub3- <dig> in the gene sequences of glu-b3f and glu-b3g  <cit> . the differences were firstly, the sequence length of glu-b3f was  <dig> bp longer than that of glu-b3g in the glub3- <dig> gene, and secondly, there were single base differences between glu-b3f and glu-b3g in both glub3- <dig> and glub3- <dig>  therefore, alleles glu-b3f and glu-b3g reported in previous studies were different alleles although they could not be reliably differentiated by sds-page, 2-de or maldi-tof-ms  <cit> .

glu-d <dig> appeared to be the most complicated locus. it contains the highest number of genes and expressed subunits compared to the other two loci, and yet most of the subunits across different alleles have similar molecular weights. electrophoresis based methods and pcr are not efficient in differentiating glu-d <dig> alleles. the maldi-tof-ms based method can differentiate glu-d <dig> alleles since it is able to differentiate subtle changes in mass values. high accuracy mass calibration to remove the variations in mass measurement is the key to improve the efficiency of maldi-tof in differentiating these alleles.

comparison of the four methods for identification of lmw-gs composition
the data from all five laboratories and the four methods employed showed that alleles glu-a3b, glu-a3d and glu-a3e were consistently identified by all four methods. similarly, analyses of alleles glu-b3a, glu-b3b, glu-b3c, glu-b3h and glu-b3j were in agreement for all four methods. at the glu-d <dig>  only the glu-d3c allele was consistently identified by sds-page, 2-de and maldi-tof-ms. the discrepancies in allelic identification using the different methods are indicated in table  <dig>  alleles glu-a3a and glu-a3c could not be distinguished by maldi-tof-ms due to their nearly identical molecular masses. similarly, these two alleles could not be reliably identified by sds-page and 2-de due to their identical mobilities and pi. however, it was easy to differentiate them by pcr. in sds-page gels, the higher mobility patterns of alleles glu-b3d, glu-b3h, glu-b3i overlapped with those of alleles glu-a3a or glu-a3c, and lower mobility patterns overlapped with those of allele glu-a3b. these results were in agreement with the reports of gupta and shepherd  <cit> , who concluded that ambiguous identification of subunits was possibly caused by differential staining intensity of banding patterns. the difficulty to differentiate glu-b3b and glu-b3g based on sds-page banding patterns arose from their similar mobilities. however, as shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  several glu-b <dig> alleles could be readily discriminated using gliadins as a marker for glutenin by sds-page. these alleles had clearly different peaks or spots using maldi-tof-ms or 2-de, respectively. alleles glu-d3a and glu-d3b could not be reliably separated by maldi-tof-ms or 2-de. it is suggested that the glu-d <dig> alleles should be differentiated by a combination of primers  <cit> .

√ - confirmed; - data not available

the 2-de method is generally considered as the most powerful tool for identifying storage protein polymorphism of proteins in wheat  <cit> . however, different bands in sds-page separations were not always distinguishable in 2-de separations. for example, alleles glu-b3d and glu-b3i could be identified by sds-page, but not by 2-de. for lmw-gs identification in wheat breeding programs, pcr and/or sds-page of both gliadin and glutenin extracts should be used as the basic method, with 2-de and maldi-tof-ms as complementary approaches. a combination of different methods is recommended for differentiating certain lmw-gs alleles, particularly those suspected as being novel.

comparison of the four methods is presented in table  <dig>  utilization of a particular method will depend upon research objectives and the targeted materials. with appropriate classification of glutenin alleles, it is possible to improve wheat quality by selection of alleles and allelic combinations with desired quality performance. if progeny screening and cultivar development is the objective, pcr will likely be adequate for the identification of glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> alleles. however, if the aim is to determine the glutenin subunits of potential parents for predicting cross performance and designing crossing schemes, or to identify specific alleles such as glu-a3g, glu-b3ab, glu-b3ac, or distinguish between the glu-d <dig> alleles, a combination of methods should be used, i.e. pcr with 2-de or pcr with sds-page and 2-de, in order to achieve the correct identification of lmw-gs alleles.

a set of standard cultivars for identification of lmw-gs
from this study of  <dig> wheat cultivars from  <dig> countries we propose a set of  <dig> cultivars for determination of lmw-gs  irrespective of the method to be used. figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> show glutenin electropherograms of  <dig>  of the  <dig> genotypes presented in table  <dig>  they cover all lmw-gs allelic variants identified in the original set. a core set of chinese spring, opata  <dig>  seri  <dig> and pavon  <dig> is recommended for inclusion in all gels. most of the common glu- <dig> alleles are represented among this group and their distributions on gels will provide useful landmarks for comparison with other bands. in this classification, it is possible to differentiate alleles glu-a3g from glu-a3d, glu-b3ab from glu-b3b, glu-b3ac from glu-b3g, glu-b3ad from glu-b3i, and glu-d3l from glu-d3c. alleles glu-d3e and glu-d3c are assumed to be identical. the allele in cultivar darius, with no distinct spot in 2-de gels, is a new allele, glu-d3m. the new allele glu-d3n identified in the cultivar fengmai  <dig> has a distinct spot in 2-de and different mobility in sds-page . however, more work is needed to further characterize these new alleles at the glu-d <dig> locus. the other alleles were the same as those observed by gupta and shepherd  <cit> .

the core group is in bold

allele glu-a3g, identified in the canadian cultivars bluesky and glenlea by 2-de in the current collection, is widely distributed in many cultivars from canada and the u.s.a.  <cit> . in previous studies, allele glu-a3g was frequently identified as glu-a3d due to their similar sds-page patterns. the role of glu-a3g in bread making quality therefore requires further study. similarly, effects on bread making quality of alleles glu-b3ab, glu-b3ac, glu-b3ad and glu-d3l, with two additional distinct spots compared to alleles glu-b3b, glu-b3g, glu-b3i and glu-d3c, respectively, also need further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
four methods, sds-page, 2-de, maldi-tof-ms and pcr, were used for identifying the lmw-gs composition in wheat cultivars from  <dig> countries. all seven glu-a <dig> alleles could be identified by 2-de and pcr, and only four and five of the seven could be differentiated by maldi-tof-ms and sds-page of the glutenin extract, respectively. the glu-b <dig> alleles glu-b3a, glu-b3b, glu-b3c, glu-b3g, glu-b3h and glu-b3j could be identified by all four methods, but alleles glu-b3ab, glu-b3ac, glu-b3ad could only be identified by the 2-de method. glu-d <dig> alleles were very difficult to clearly distinguish by sds-page, 2-de and pcr. maldi-tof-ms was promising in reliably differentiating them. pcr is a simple, accurate, and low cost method for identifying glu-a <dig> and glu-b <dig> alleles that are currently routinely analysed by sds-page in breeding programs. however, sds-page using a multi-gel buffer chamber, and running both gliadins and glutenin extracts is also a highly reliable method. a combination of all methods will help to identify specific alleles, especially potentially new alleles.

a set of  <dig> cultivars  was recommended for identifying lmw-gs alleles. these standard cultivars cover all variants of lmw-gs in the collection investigated. among them, chinese spring, opata  <dig>  seri  <dig> and pavon  <dig>  are recommended as a core set to be included in each sds-page gel when identifying alleles of lmw-gs genes. the  <dig> cultivars have been placed in cimmyt's and inra clermont ferrand, france germplasm banks and seed is being multiplied to make them freely available as a set upon request. accession numbers will be assigned once the glu-1/glu- <dig> allelic composition is confirmed.
