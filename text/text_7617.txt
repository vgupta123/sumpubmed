BACKGROUND
living cells are considered noisy or stochastic biochemical reactors. most of the cell to cell variability is due to existence of stochastic switches or slow reaction channels involving limited numbers of reacting molecules. stochastic switches provide inputs for amplification cascades, which translate the single molecule events into a larger population of downstream effector molecules.

the most studied example of stochastic regulation is gene expression, where stochasticity, in eukaryotic organisms, arises mostly from fluctuation in gene activity  <cit>  and mrna synthesis or decay  <cit>  reviewed recently in  <cit> . control of gene activity is mediated by transcription factors that bind to specific promoter regions, switching the gene on or off. when the gene is active, rna polymerase may bind to the gene promoter and enter the transcriptional elongation mode, producing full length pre-mrna transcripts. the edited mrna is then exported to the cytoplasm, where the protein translation occurs. in this way, a single gene activation event results  in a burst of mrna molecules  <cit> , which is then translated into an even larger burst of proteins.

another example of stochastic regulation is provided by cell surface receptors and amplification of successive cascade of downstream kinases. there is a large body of evidence that cells are capable of responding to a single- or a very limited number of activating molecules. for example, retinal rod cells are able to transduce a single photon into a hyperpolarization response  <cit> . for the present study, signal amplification from a small number of receptors detecting pathogen presence is specially important since it enables cells to respond with protective cytokine cascades to protect the tissue before adaptive immune response can be generated. for example, t-lymphocytes are able to detect a single foreign peptide antigen and only three peptides are required for induction of t-cell cytotoxicity  <cit> . similar behavior is seen for the toll-interleukin  superfamily of receptors, where il- <dig> signal transduction has been observed in cells expressing only about  <dig> il- <dig> receptors per cell  <cit> . similarly, cells respond to tnfα stimulation at femtomolar concentration, i.e., when the number of tnfα ligands per cell is very limited  <cit> . in all cases, the activation of receptors leads to the initiation of a signal transduction-amplification cascade, involving activation  of downstream effector kinases. more generally, it is important to point out that cells can detect and respond to single molecule intracellular events such as dna damage  or presence of single viral rnas. although the phenomenon of cell sensitivity to single activating molecules is well established in biological systems, very few theoretical studies have addressed the effect of stochastic cell surface signaling and its consequences for the downstream cellular responses.

innate immunity is an intensively studied cellular signaling response to pathogens and pathogen-associated patterns which results in the expression of protective cytokines, such as interferon β, that serve to limit the spread of infection until more specific adaptive immunity can be generated. in this regard, the cytoplasmic transcription factor nf-κb is a major mediator of innate immune responses  <cit> . in resting cells nf-κb is sequestered in the cytoplasm by dimerization with inhibitory proteins called iκb. although several iκb isoforms have been identified, the primary inhibitor is iκbα. in the classical nf-κb activation pathway, extracellular signals such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha  and interleukin- <dig>  bind to cell surface receptors coupled to the cytoplasmic iκb kinase , a multiprotein complex that phosphorylates iκbα, leading to its ubiquitination and then to its rapid proteasomal degradation  <cit> . liberated nf-κb is then rapidly translocated into the nucleus to bind to high affinity sites in the genome, thereby influencing target gene expression. experimental findings have shown that nf-κb nuclear residence is transient and dynamic, an observation that has led to the discovery of negative feedback nf-κb-iκbα loop in the nf-κb pathway  <cit> .

the two levels of autoregulatory negative feedback control, termed the nf-κb-iκbα and nf-κb-a20-ikk feedback loops, arise because both iκbα and a <dig> genes are directly regulated by nf-κb binding. in the nf-κb-iκbα feedback loop, nf-κb enters the nucleus after iκbα degradation, nf-κb induces iκbα resynthesis to recapture activated nuclear nf-κb and return it to the cytoplasm. in the nf-κb-a20-ikk feedback loop, a <dig>  a protein that is not expressed prior to stimulation is also strongly nf-κb responsive  <cit> . a <dig> is an inhibitor of ikk kinase that complexes with an ikk regulatory subunit leading to its inactivation and that induces degradation of rip a necessary component of the active tnfr <dig> receptor complex. without a <dig> expression, the ikk retains activity which leads to rapid degradation of the newly resynthesized iκbα, which destroys the nf-κb-iκbα feedback loop  <cit> . as an illustration, genetically a <dig> deficient mice are hypersensitive to tnfα and develop severe in inflammation even though they have an intact iκbα mrna expression  <cit> .

nuclear nf-κb activates groups of genes through a process initiated by its binding to high affinity dna binding sites in regulatory regions of their promoters. although nf-κb binding to some genes results in rate-limiting complex formation of coactivators, pre-initiation factors, and rna polymerase  ii, the mode of regulation of rapidly induced negative feedback inhibitors appears to be distinct. interestingly, chromatin immunoprecipitation assays have shown that the iκbα and a <dig> promoters are "pre-loaded"- already bound by general transcription factors, coactivators and rna pol ii, waiting for the presence of nf-κb binding to activate expression  <cit> . in these promoters, rna pol ii is stalled in an activated state; upon nf-κb binding, rna pol ii enters a competent transcriptional elongation mode and becomes able to transcribe the gene. in this manner, the inhibitory genes of the nf-κb feedback loop are poised to rapidly respond to the presence of nuclear nf-κb.

in last five years several models of the nf-κb signaling regulatory module have been developed, reviewed in  <cit> . the first attempt was a one-feedback loop model that concentrated on the interplay between the three iκb isoforms  <cit> . the next attempt was our two feedback loop model  <cit> , incorporating effects of both the iκbα and a <dig> inhibitors. in this model the representation of the nf-κb-iκb regulatory module was simplified by incorporation of only one iκb inhibitor, iκbα, that is responsible for the majority of cytoplasmic nf-κb binding and the only one which knockout is lethal,  <cit> . incorporating the second nf-κb-a20-ikk negative feedback loop, accurately predicted the time dependent profile of ikk activity. a third model introduced the transduction pathway, from the tnfr <dig> receptor to activation of the ikkk and ikk kinases and was used to analyze responses of hepg <dig> cells and hepg <dig> . <dig>  to tnfα stimulation  <cit> .

recently, the nf-κb signaling in single cells was analyzed both experimentally  <cit>  and numerically by means of stochastic modeling  <cit> , or agent-based modeling  <cit> . both analyses indicate that the nf-κb regulatory module demands single cell, stochastic analysis due to cellular heterogeneity and population asynchrony. in the present work we expand our two-feedback loop, single-cell stochastic model of nf-κb activation to incorporate a second stochastic switch at the level of the tnfα-tnfr <dig> interaction. we analyze response of the nf-κb regulatory module over a broad range of stimulation by its activating ligand. we will show, how, although this may seem counter-intuitive, stochasticity and stochastic switches may introduce robustness into the gene regulatory response. in short, the stochastic robustness is due to amplification cascades and progressive signal saturation. as a result, a low amplitude signal  leads to an "almost" yes or no response, with the probability of yes being a function of the input signal amplitude. this type of regulation enables cells to chose a well-defined fate such as signaling, apoptosis, or others, but in addition it allows individual cell responses to vary. in the range of stimulation amplitudes, for which most cells follow the same evolution path, the cell population-based experiments and modeling are well justified. however, in the case when population is a mixture of differently responding cells  the average trajectory does not represent any biological process and the model reproducing such trajectory is likely to be incorrect.

RESULTS
stochastic switches and amplification cascades in nf-κb regulation
our considerations are based on the two-feedback loop stochastic model of the nf-κb pathway, which combines the signal transduction cascade that connects cell surface receptors with the core regulatory module analyzed previously  <cit> . current model involves two-compartment kinetics of transcription factor nf-κb, its activators, ikkk, ikk and inhibitors, a <dig> and iκbα, shown in fig.  <dig>  ikkk represents the ikk activating kinase, which itself is activated at the tnfr <dig> receptor complex .

in additional file  <dig>  we demonstrate the model's ability to reproduce major nf-κb pathway experiments on cells exhibiting oscillations in cytoplasmic to nuclear nf-κb localization that arise in response to persistent tnfα stimulation.

in the current paper we focus on tnfα signaling, a process initiated by binding of tnfα to the ubiquitous receptor tnfr <dig>  in short, the action of regulatory pathway may be summarized as follows: binding of tnfα trimer initiates receptor tnfr <dig> trimerization and formation of an active receptor complex in a multistep process involving binding of rip and traf <dig>  the active receptor complex activates the ikkk kinase . active kinase ikkka phosphorylates and activates the ikk kinase . active ikka kinase transiently binds to the cytoplasmic  complex and phosphorylates iκbα initiating its degradation. released nf-κb enters the nucleus to induce transcription of inhibitors iκbα and a <dig> genes. the first negative feedback loop involves the iκbα protein, which is rapidly resynthesized, enters the nucleus and recaptures nf-κb back into the cytoplasm. in the continued presence of ikka, however, the resynthesized iκbα would be continuously degraded, which would result in continued nuclear nf-κb translocation. a second level of negative autoregulation occurs with the resynthesis of a <dig>  a ubiquitin ligase which controls ikk activity. a <dig> initiates degradation of rip, the key component of tnfr <dig> receptor complex, what attenuates the activity of receptors and directly associates itself with ikka, enhancing its conversion to catalytically inactive ikki. inactive kinase ikki spontaneously converts back to ikkn through the intermediate form ikkii. similarly, active kinase ikkka rapidly converts to the inactive form ikkkn.

we identified two stochastic processes crucial to the functioning of the nf-κb regulatory pathway:  activation of a <dig> and iκbα genes via binding of nf-κb molecules to the genes promoters and  activation of tnfr <dig> receptors via binding of tnfα trimers. these stochastic events may influence the evolution and fate of the cell due to their association with amplification cascades, as shown in fig.  <dig> .

gene expression cascade  starts from the activation of a single gene copy, which may then serve as a template for the synthesis of tens or hundreds of mrna molecules. in turn, a single mrna molecule is a template for synthesis of hundreds of protein molecules. in this way the two iκbα gene copies are sufficient to replenish pool of iκbα proteins of about  <dig>  molecules, within a half hour. as estimated experimentally by yang  <cit>  the endogenous level of iκbα molecules is  <dig> , most of these molecules are degraded at in first  <dig> min. of high dose tnfα stimulation, and then iκbα level is approximately restored between  <dig> and  <dig> min. of stimulation  <cit> .

at the level of cell surface receptors, a single tnfα trimer binding to the tnfr <dig> receptor leads to receptor trimerization and formation of a stable active receptor complex . grell  <cit>  found that tnfα trimers dissociate from tnfr <dig> receptors with a half time of  <dig> min., while the internalization time is of order of  <dig> to  <dig> min. during this time the single active receptor may activate numerous ikkk kinase molecules. in turn, each active ikkka activates numerous ikk kinases, and each of ikka may phosphorylate several iκbα molecules leading to their degradation. the ikkk-ikk transduction cascade resembles the mapk cascade and provides signal amplifica-tion of several orders of magnitude  <cit> . this amplification mechanisms enables cells to respond to femtomolar concentrations of tnfα  <cit>  and references therein.

recently, in cell population studies, cheong et al.  <cit>  observed activation of the nf-κb regulatory module in response to tnfα concentrations of  <dig>  ng/ml. this equals to  <dig> fm  and implies about  <dig> tnfα trimer per  <dig> × 10-12l or less than one tnfα trimer molecule per volume of mammalian cell which is of the order  <dig> × 10-12l. this estimations suggests that cells may be activated by binding of a single, or few, tnfα trimers, and that at femtomolar concentration some cells may become active and some not, since tnfα binding is a stochastic process. it also indicates that when such small concentrations are considered, the average number of tnfα trimers per cell may be a better parameter to describe the experiment than the tnfα concentration itself. for example chan and aggarwal  <cit>  observed two fold nf-κb induction at tnfα dose of  <dig> fm. for the emsa assay they incubated  <dig> ×  <dig> cells in  <dig> μl medium, which gives  <dig> tnf trimers per cell. the same concentration in tissue, where the cells are tightly packed would imply less than  <dig> molecule of activator per cell. the number of tnfr <dig> receptors per cell may vary significantly between cell lines  <cit> , e.g. there are about  <dig> tnfr <dig> per cell for hela  <cit> , and about  <dig> for histiocytic lymphoma  cells  <cit> , but much less for b-cell lymphoma  cells. since in low dose experiments there are more tnfr <dig> receptors, than tnfα molecules, the concentration of free tnfα will be influenced by reaction with these receptors and will not remain constant in the course of low dose experiments. similarly, when the spread of tnfα in the tissue is considered one may expect that tnfα diffusion will be strongly influenced by binding to free tnfr <dig> receptors, which may restrict cell to cell signaling to very short distances.

in hl <dig> cells, nf-κb activity was already observed at tnfα concentrations as low as  <dig>  pm whereas maximum nf-κb activation required  <dig>  to  <dig> pm tnfα,  <cit> .

there is also an ample evidence that cells are able to respond to single viruses, which are known to activate nf-κb pathway through toll-like receptors dependent and independent pathways, both engaging ikk,  <cit> . specifically, in a recent analysis of human a <dig> pulmonary type ii epithelial cells infected by respiratory syncytial virus  at moi =  <dig>  we showed that 60% of cell exhibit rela activation  <cit> . the moi =  <dig> implies  that 37% of cell will remain uninfected, while only 26% of cell will be infected by more than  <dig> virion. thus the observed 60% fraction of responding cells implies that a single virus is enough to induce nf-κb activity in a cell. arnold et al.  <cit>  analyzed responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells  after exposure to low infectious rsv doses, with moi from  <dig>  to  <dig>  even at moi as low as  <dig> – <dig>  they observed pronounced secretion of, nf-κb responsive cytokines like il- <dig>  il- <dig> and tnfα at  <dig> hours after infection.

system recovery: pulse-pulse experiment
although several studies  <cit>  have clarified the relationship between time profile of ikk activity and nf-κb oscillations, less is known about the regulation of ikk activity itself. in response to tnf stimulation, ikk is rapidly activated and then inactivated. as demonstrated by the experimental findings  <cit>  and modeling  <cit> , an important mechanism for this inactivation is mediated by the nf-κb – a <dig> negative feedback loop. here, a short pulse of tnfα results in a brief peak of ikka followed by peak in nuclear nf-κb and burst of a <dig> mrna and protein. the newly synthesized a <dig> attenuates ikk activity, making the cell temporarily less sensitive to subsequent tnfα stimulation. as described earlier, a <dig> acts via direct and indirect mechanisms. directly it binds to the regulatory subunit of ikk, speeding transformation of ikka into the inactive, hyperphosphorylated ikk . indirectly, it ubiquitinates rip, a necessary component of the active receptor complex leading to its specific proteasomal degradation, thereby lowering the average receptor activity. an interesting question arises: how much time is needed for the system to recover, i.e., how long should be the break after a brief tnfα pulse to allow for the equal response to subsequent pulse? in order to answer the question we performed an experiment  in which the population of 3t <dig> cells is stimulated by two brief tnfα pulses  spaced at various times apart ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> min. this saturating tnfα concentration makes the individual cell responses well synchronized, allowing for reliable population analysis, fig  <dig>  the ikk kinase activity is measured  <dig> min. after the second pulse, and the ikk activity of the second peak relative to the first is expressed as a function of break duration.

the experiment helped us to determine the parameters governing the nf-κb – a <dig> – ikk negative feedback loop, figs 3g and 3h. although after a short break the system did not respond, full recovery of the system was observed after  <dig>  hours. surprisingly, when the duration of the break was extended to  <dig> hours the second peak of ikk activity was higher than the first one. one could interpret this result as the evidence that after  <dig>  to  <dig> hours the cytoplasmic a <dig> concentration decreases to pretreatment values and some other protein is elevating ikk activity. one of the candidates could be traf <dig>  which is nf-κb responsive and is a constituent of the tnfr <dig> receptor complex  <cit> . to test this hypothesis we assume that at second peak the activity of tnfα bound receptors is elevated  <dig> fold, fig. 3i, and in fact this modification resulted in an elevated ikk profile similar to the experimental findings. however, since we do not find this a strong enough verification, we have not introduced this modification to the current model.

cell respond to stimulations by a wide range of tnfα doses
we performed the single cell stochastic numerical simulations  of our model to analyze the individual cell responses to persistent stimulation in a broad range of tnfα doses. we assumed that there were  <dig> tnfr <dig> receptors on cell surface, and each of these receptors might be independently activated or inactivated, and that the activation rate was proportional to the tnfα concentration, which was kept constant during the experiment. at a high tnfα dose  the receptor activation rate is high and most of cells are activated in the first few minutes after the tnfα stimulation begins. as a result, the first peak of ikk activity and the first peak of nf-κb nuclear to cytoplasmic oscillation are well synchronized among cells. synchronization of subsequent peaks of nf-κb oscillations decreases due to the stochastic processes of activation of tnfr <dig> receptors and a <dig> and iκbα genes. such behavior well agrees with nelson et al.  <cit>  single cell experiment on sknas cells, fig 4a versus 4b.

for low doses , the activation of each cell is typically due to the activation of single receptor or a small number of receptors and thus the first response time varies between cells. as a result, the nf-κb oscillations are not synchronized at all. moreover, for the lowest dose  the time span between subsequent oscillations varies significantly. the last is due to the fact that when tnfα molecules dissociate the cell become unstimulated. it is however possible that dissociated tnfα molecule is immediately captured by other tnfr <dig> receptors  of the same cell. this effect would keep the once stimulated cell in semi-periodic oscillatory mode for the longer time. interestingly, the amplitude of the second and subsequent oscillations is higher for the low tnfα dose than for the high dose. this is due to the fact that at a low tnfα dose the ikk activation proceeds not as fast: the first peak of ikka is smaller than for a high dose  and more ikkn remains to be activated. as a result the system at low dose stimulation exhibits subsequent ikka pulses followed by high nf-κb oscillations .

activation of a single tnfr <dig> receptor complex  turns on the nf-κb regulatory module
mentioned earlier, the ability of the cell to respond to femtomolar tnfα concentrations suggests that nf-κb regulatory module may be turned on by the single tnfα trimer activating one tnfr <dig> receptor . according to our model the lower tnfα dose results in lower probability of cell activation, but not in a much weaker response in the responding cells . we have chosen the receptors activation coefficient such that 90% of cells are activated  in the first  <dig> minutes of tnfα stimulation by the dose of  <dig> ng/ml, which may be treated as a saturation dose, until the persistent stimulation is considered. this is in agreement with experimental observations in which responses to tnfα doses of  <dig> ng/ml or  <dig> ng/ml are almost identical. below this dose, the individual cell responses become asynchronous and at any given moment the population is a mixture of responsive and nonresponsive cells.

because the nf-κb regulatory network has the amplification-saturation pathway build in, the final cell response measured at the level of nf-κb responsive genes is about the same in the case when the single receptor  is activated as when  <dig> receptor complexes are activated. to see how cell's response depends on the number of active receptors, one can perform the following numerical experiment. let us assume that at t =  <dig>  a given number n  of receptors is activated and that these receptors remain active for  <dig> min. we traced the average heights of the peaks of active ikkk, active ikk, nuclear nf-κb, and a <dig> mrna, fig. 5b. we thus observed four levels of signal saturation; first three are connected with the transduction-amplification pathway, the last one with gene regulation. according to our model the fivefold decrease in peak ikk activity when we pass from  <dig> to  <dig> active receptor, does not result in much lower nf-κb oscillation amplitude. this is in agreement with bulk of experimental data suggesting that peak ikk activity at high and intermediate tnfα dose of  <dig> or  <dig> ng/ml is much higher than needed for efficient iκbα degradation. specifically, lee et al.  <cit>  demonstrated  that a very low ikk activity tail is sufficient to maintain oscillations in iκbα level, and that a higher ikk activity tail, typical for a <dig> deficient mefs, totally suppress iκbα accumulation. this result was confirmed by quantitative data of werner et al.  <cit>  who stimulated a <dig> deficient, immortalized 3t <dig> cells by a  <dig> minute long tnfα pulse at a dose of  <dig> ng/ml. they found that the peak of ikk activity  was followed by tail of fivefold lower magnitude but that this was enough to keep most of nf-κb in the nucleus. the fact that nf-κb remains nuclear implies high iκbα synthesis rate and thus high degradation rate, so it may not accumulate to uptake nf-κb back to cytoplasm.

the high sensitivity of nf-κb responses to low dose tnfα stimulation has been already reported by cheong et al.  <cit>  who, based on experiments with decreasing tnfα dose from  <dig> to  <dig>  ng/ml, concluded that nf-κb amplitude is a logarithmic function of tnfα dose: it decreases only twice as the doses changes from  <dig> to  <dig>  ng/ml. the effect we reported in figs. 5b and 6b is even more dramatic, the nf-κb amplitude remains almost independent of the tnfα dose assuming that only the activated cells are considered. the single cell model we constructed suggests that the decrease of nf-κb amplitude shown by cheong et al.  <cit>   is at least partially due to pure synchronization of cells. as recently experimentally demonstrated by sillitoe et al.  <cit>  the averaging causes that nf-κb pulses appear much smaller than they are. sillitoe et al.  <cit>  experiment was performed for tnfα dose of  <dig> ng/ml, but even at that dose  the first peak, amplitude of the average trajectory is about twice smaller than single cell amplitudes, and this difference is larger for the second peak at which cells are less synchronized. in addition, at the smallest dose of  <dig>  ng/ml studied by cheong et al.  <cit> , which corresponds to only 1/ <dig> of tnfα trimer per cell volume, we observe the effect of averaging over responsive and nonresponsive cells, which lowers the amplitude of average nf-κb trajectory.

there is still not enough experimental data at single cell level to uniquely determine how each step of transduction amplification cascade contributes to amplification. cheong et al.  <cit>  attempted to address this question based on population data and found that a  <dig> fold decrease of tnfα dose from  <dig> to  <dig>  ng/ml results in a fourfold decrease of ikk activity peak and in a twofold decrease of nf-κb amplitude. as already discussed, the population data can be quite misleading, and in fact to fit to this data cheong et al.  <cit>  had to assume time dependent ikk activation and inactivation rates. such approach seems artificial and cannot be applied to more general protocols of tnfα stimulation .

as discussed above, the constructed model has the property that the stable activity of a single receptor is sufficient to turn on the nf-κb regulatory module and trigger the transcription of nf-κb dependent genes. although the experimental data suggests that the a very limited number of active receptors is needed to induce nf-κb activity, there is no evidence that activity of a single receptor is sufficient. one may expect that there exists a threshold of the number of active receptors  needed for cell activation. in the case of t-cells stimulation, it was experimentally demonstrated  <cit>  that just three major peptide histocompatibility complexes are required to induce t-cell cytotoxic activity. t-cell receptor signalling involves mapk kinase cascade  <cit> , which can convert graded inputs into switch-like outputs  <cit> . both mapk and mapkk require two phosphorylations to become fully activated, and this dual phosphorylation is a source of nonlinearity in signal processing, which together with saturation  results in a switch-like output.

since we did not identify any simple mechanisms defining the threshold here, we followed the simplest possibility and assumed that amplification provided by the tnfr1-ikkk-ikk-iκbα cascade is high enough to cause that activation of a single receptor is sufficient to induce cell activity. to rule out or confirm the competitive threshold hypothesis it is worth to consider a series of single cell experiments, in which cells would be stimulated for  <dig> min. with a decreasing tnfα dose, and measure the fraction of responding cells. pulse stimulation would help localize activation and response to relatively short time periods.

according to our model, the probability that a single receptor is activated by a tnfα stimulation lasting for time t at a concentration c is equal to

  pr <dig> =  <dig> - exp, 

where kb is the receptor activation rate. thus, if activation of a single receptor is sufficient to activate the cell, then the fraction of responding cells f would decrease approximately linearly with tnfα concentration c for low concentrations c. if however, at least n receptors must be activated in order to activate the cell then the probability of cell activation would be equal to prn

  prn=1−∑i=0n−1×iexp⁡n−i, 

where n is total number of receptors and kbn is the new hypothetical tnfα binding constant. in such case the fraction of responding cells f would decrease faster, approximately as cn . in fig. 6a we compare model predictions  against threshold hypothesis  and  for n =  <dig>  activation probability functions pr <dig> and pr <dig> are normalized by adjusting activation rates kb <dig> ≃  <dig>  kb and kb <dig> ≃  <dig>  kb, what assures that all prn functions intersect at the same point at which prn = 1/ <dig> 

the single pulse, low dose, experiment would also enable us to determine the "minimum cell response" as the average  nf-κb oscillation amplitude for very small c. according to our model  such a minimum response exists and moreover it is high enough to assure unequivocal expression of nf-κb responsive genes in majority of responding cells.

CONCLUSIONS
stochastic gene activation  and stochastic cell activation  leads to what might be called "stochastic robustness" in cell regulation. if a given gene is activated, a large burst of proteins is produced, in order to assure a sufficient level of activity of these proteins. stochastic robustness assures the minimal response to the signal. decreasing magnitude of the signal mostly reduces the probability of response, which leads to a smaller fraction of responding cells. this may be a useful strategy: if the tnfα signal is low, some cells respond by a massive nf-κb translocation, whereas some do not respond at all. it helps to avoid ambiguity, such as when a small nuclear concentration of nf-κb leads to activation of an undefined fraction of nf-κb responsive genes. such an ambiguous response might do more harm than good. in fact the all-or-none responses arising due to ultrasensitivity and saturation or bistability  have been reported for various signalling elements: tcr signaling  <cit> , xenopus p <dig> mapk cascade  <cit> , transduction cascade jnk in oocytes  <cit> , and lac operon, e.g.  <cit> . the growing evidence of bistability in various system may suggest that it is a good strategy for regulation at the tissue level.

stochastic robustness allows cells to respond differently to the same stimulation, but makes their individual responses better defined. both effects could be crucial in early immune response: diversity in cell responses causes the tissue defense to be harder to overcome by relatively simple programs coded in viruses and other pathogens. the more focused single cell responses help cells to decide their individual fates such as proliferation or apoptosis.

the stochastic model proposed by us explains the mechanisms of tnfα cell activation at nanomolar concentrations when the number of molecules of activation factor per cell is very limited. in the example of tnfα diffusion in the tissue, considered by cheong et al.  <cit> , concentration of  <dig>  ng/ml or  <dig> fm corresponds to less than one tnfα trimer per cell. in such case population consists of responding and nonresponsive cells, and the output observed at the population level reflects averaging these two subpopulations. at low dose stimulation no individual cell evolves like the average and the average does not correspond to any biological process. this means that the model build to follow the average trajectory in general may not be correct. despite this fact, the experimental average may be useful when compared with the average of many single cell stochastic simulations. predictions from our model agree qualitatively with large set of population data  including the cheong et al.  <cit>  experiment in which ikk and nf-κb activity were measured across a wide range of tnfα concentrations, fig.  <dig> 

the proposed model supports hypothesis that at nanomolar concentrations nf-κb activity results from binding of single tnfα trimers. such hypersensitivity of nf-κb regulatory module may be the only way to detect and respond to single viruses invading cells and to allow for cytokine extracellular signaling.
