BACKGROUND
the vertebrate olfactory system receives and decodes sensory information from a myriad chemical cues. the first step in this process is the recognition of these cues by receptors expressed by the primary sensory neurons in the olfactory epithelium . receptor-mediated activity within the population of olfactory sensory neurons is then interpreted by the brain to identify the molecular nature of the odorant stimulus. a large multigene family thought to encode odorant receptors was initially identified in the rat  <cit>  and belong to what is now referred to as the "or" superfamily of odorant receptors . the predicted structure of these receptors exhibits a seven transmembrane domain topology characteristic of the "a family" or rhodopsin class of g protein-coupled receptors . the size of the or gene family in mammals is extremely large and is estimated to contain over  <dig> individual genes in some species  <cit> . in the fish, the size of the or repertoire appears to be much smaller and appears to contain only ~ <dig> to ~ <dig> genes, depending on the species examined  <cit> . more recently, members of the trace amine-associated receptor  family were shown to be expressed in mouse olfactory neurons and are thought to mediate the reception of amine-based chemosensory cues  <cit> .

two types of gpcrs unrelated to the or or taar families are expressed in the mammalian vomeronasal organ: the v1r receptors  <cit>  and the v2r receptors  <cit> . the v1r receptors are expressed within the subpopulation of gαi-expressing vno sensory neurons  <cit> . genome-wide surveys have revealed the presence of approximately  <dig> v1r genes in the mouse genome  <cit> . the v2r receptors belong to the "c family" of gpcrs, which includes the metabotropic glutamate receptors , extracellular calcium sensing receptors , and gaba-b receptors  <cit> . members of this receptor family are characterized by their long n-terminal extracellular domain, which contains the primary determinants for ligand binding  <cit> ). the mouse and rat genomes each encode approximately  <dig> v2r genes  <cit> ; these receptors are expressed in the subclass of gαo-expressing neurons in a pattern complementary to v1r/gαi expression  <cit> . because of their expression in the vomeronasal organ – a structure specialized for the detection of non-volatile cues, including pheromones – the v1r and v2r receptors have been widely postulated to represent pheromone receptors . indeed, a number of studies have demonstrated that specific v1r- and v2r-expressing vomeronasal neurons respond to known pheromones  <cit> ; however, formal proof that the v1r and v2r are pheromone receptors awaits a direct demonstration of ligand-receptor interactions between such compounds and these receptors.

in the fish, receptors belonging to the c family of gpcrs have been shown to be expressed in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . the olfactory c family gpcrs are expressed by the subpopulation of microvillous sensory neurons in the fish's single olfactory organ, distinct from the ciliated sensory neurons which express members of the or family of odorant receptors  <cit> . significantly, two orthologous receptors from the goldfish and zebrafish  are activated by amino acids  <cit> , which are potent feeding cues in fish  <cit> . these observations raise the possibility that the olfactory c family gpcrs as a group represent a family of amino acid-sensing receptors in teleost fish.

to gain insights into the evolution and function of olfactory c family gpcrs, we performed an analysis of this receptor gene family in the zebrafish, danio rerio. through genome database mining of the zebrafish genome sequence provided by the sanger institute danio rerio sequencing project, we identified and characterized the complete repertoire of olfactory c family gpcrs. our analysis identified  <dig> genes , which can be divided into  <dig> subfamilies. although two of the intact zebrafish receptor genes appear to be orthologous to mammalian v2r or v2r-like genes, the major group of zebrafish receptors form a clade distinct from the mammalian v2r receptors. in addition, our analysis of the zebrafish receptors revealed – in all family members – a conserved signature motif previously shown to be involved in ligand binding in other amino acid-sensing receptors  <cit> . in contrast, other amino acid positions predicted to form contact sites in the ligand binding pocket show marked divergence within the zebrafish receptor family. together these observations suggest that the zebrafish olfactory c family gpcrs comprise a family of receptors that has evolved to recognize a diverse array of amino acid and/or amino acid-based ligands.

RESULTS
prediction of zebrafish olfc genes
the second  and third  draft zebrafish genome assemblies  <cit>  of whole genome shotgun sequence  were searched for olfc gene sequences using homology to known fish olfc proteins as a guide. a final search of the sixth draft assembly  with the identified olfc genes revealed no additional sequences. the resulting genes were then mapped to the zv <dig> assembly.

in contrast to the typically uninterrupted coding sequence of or genes, the intron-exon structure of the genes encoding the c family gpcrs comprises a minimum of  <dig> exons . our gene prediction strategy was to combine a low-threshold blast search with profile hidden markov model- based gene prediction with the program genewise  <cit> . this process was repeated in an iterative fashion, as follows. the zebrafish genome assembly was subjected to tblastn search using known full-length olfactory c family gpcrs from zebrafish, goldfish and fugu. initial query sequences included goldfish olfactory receptors  <dig> ,  <dig> , gfb <dig>  and gfb <dig>  zebrafish zo <dig>  and fugu ca <dig> , ca <dig>  ca <dig>  ca <dig> and ca <dig>   <cit> . the gene prediction program genewise was then run on the genomic sequences surrounding each unique blast hit using a profile hidden markov model  of the gene family . the genewise predictions were examined manually and extended to appropriate start and stop codons based on alignment of the amino acid translation to known or previously predicted olfactory c family gpcr sequences. splice site predictions were also edited when possible to minimize the occurrence of gaps at splice junctions in the alignment and maintain intron positions with respect to the amino acid sequence alignment. at this stage, predicted genes highly similar to the casr, mglurs and t1rs were set apart from the putative olfactory sequences. in each round, the newly-predicted genes were added as queries for the next blast search, and a new profile hmm was constructed for use in the next round of gene prediction. the family of putative olfactory c family gpcrs is designated "olfc" for olfactory c family gpcr .

olfc gene sequences were considered intact if they 1) begin with a signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after the seventh predicted transmembrane domain, 3) show significant alignment to all six stereotypical olfc exons, and 4) possess no internal frame shifts, significant deletions  or stop codons. predicted genes were categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they at met the first three criteria but failed the fourth. sequences were considered partial genes if they failed one of the first three criteria but met the fourth. finally, predicted genes were considered partial pseudogenes if they failed all four criteria.

using these criteria, our search identified  <dig> intact olfc genes,  <dig> partial genes,  <dig> full-length pseudogenes and  <dig> partial pseudogene, for a total of  <dig> sequences. two additional partial pseudogenes  were recently reported by hashiguchi and nishida  <cit> ; see below). we therefore included them in the total count of  <dig> olfc genes  but excluded them from further analysis. all full-length genes exhibit a conserved gene structure, with the protein coding sequence encoded by  <dig> exons . variation in exon length is evident, even within individual subfamilies, although variation in exon length is greater between subfamilies . interestingly, however, the phases of intron/exon boundaries within codons are strictly conserved across all members of the family .

a intact genes are defined as those sequences that 1) contain a leading signal sequence, 2) end in a stop codon after the seventh predicted transmembrane domain, 3) show significant alignment to all six stereotypical olfc exons, and 4) possess no internal frame shifts, significant deletions  or stop codons.

b partial genes comprise those sequences that fail one of the first three criteria  but meet the fourth.

c sequences are categorized as full-length pseudogenes if they meet the first three criteria but fail the fourth.

d sequences that fail to meet all four criteria are categorized as partial pseudogenes.

e includes two partial pseudogenes identified in  <cit>  but not identified in this study.

a recent study based on the 4th assembly of the draft zebrafish genome  identified a total of  <dig> olfc sequences, including  <dig> partial sequences  <cit> . forty of the  <dig> sequences appear to have frame shifts or stop codons. we ascribe the discrepancies with our results in part to the difference in genome assemblies used for the two analyses . in the present analysis, we found that many of the non-overlapping sequences previously identified as distinct genes  <cit>  in fact map to a smaller set of common, intact genes . we also found that all full-length olfc gene sequences have a conserved gene structure ; previously reported variations to this organization  <cit>  are likely due to sequencing errors in earlier genome assemblies and inaccuracies in gene predictions. overall, our analysis identified all but two pseudogenes found in  <cit>  plus an additional three intact genes, one partial gene and one full-length pseudogene. based on these observations and the higher quality of our gene models , we believe that our study provides a more accurate representation of the zebrafish olfc gene family.

in addition to the  <dig> olfc sequences described above, our analysis also identified other c family gpcrs in the zebrafish genome: one putative calcium sensing receptor and  <dig> t1r-like putative taste receptors. our search for these other receptor sequences was not exhaustive, however; it is therefore possible that additional paralogs of these receptors escaped identification in our analysis. nonetheless, it is interesting to note that the four t1r-like receptors are highly similar to the three previously-identified classes of t1r taste receptors in mammals  <cit> : t1r <dig> , t1r <dig> , and t1r <dig>  .

the identity of the olfc gene family as a bona fide olfactory receptor family was confirmed by rna in situ hybridizations. probes for  <dig> intact olfc genes were hybridized individually to zebrafish olfactory epithelium . of this group,  <dig> gave detectable signal in olfactory sensory neurons. forty probes localized to cells in a punctate pattern consistent with the expression of one or a few receptor genes per neuron. two receptors, olfca <dig> and olfcc <dig>  exhibited broad expression in a large fraction of neurons. these receptors are orthologous to goldfish receptors  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively, which were previously shown to be expressed widely in the goldfish olfactory epithelium  <cit> . olfcc <dig> and goldfish receptor  <dig>  are orthologous to the mammalian v2r <dig> vomeronasal receptor, which is expressed in a large fraction of vomeronasal neurons and co-expressed with other "punctate" v2r receptors  <cit> . together our results suggest that olfca <dig> and olfcc <dig> – which comprise two clades distinct from the main group of zebrafish olfc receptors  – are the two broadly expressed receptors of the repertoire and are co-expressed with a single "punctate" receptor in each sensory neuron.

olfc nomenclature and classification
olfactory receptors belonging to the "or" superfamily have been classified into monophyletic groups, with family members sharing greater than 40% amino acid identity and subfamily members sharing greater than 60% amino acid identity  <cit> . in the case of the zebrafish olfc genes, we found that a subfamily threshold of 65% amino acid identity worked best for the generation of monophyletic clades, which we believe correspond to groups of recently duplicated olfc genes. using this threshold as an operational guideline, we classified the zebrafish olfc genes into  <dig> subfamilies, with  <dig> containing full-length olfc gene sequences  . the average percent identity between subfamilies is approximately 46%, with the maximum observed percent identity between any two olfcs of different subfamilies being 61%. the average percent identity among members within a subfamily is ~81%, with the minimum identity between any two members of any subfamily being 72%.

to unify the naming for zebrafish olfc genes, we propose a revised nomenclature based on the following rationale. first, the prefix "olfc" was adopted as the designation for the olfactory c family gpcrs identified in this and previous studies. in addition to reflecting the olfactory-specific nature of these receptors, this designation is consistent with our phylogenetic analysis , which indicates that the olfc receptors form a family distinct from other c family gpcrs, including the mammalian v2r receptors. both newly-predicted and previously-described zebrafish olfc genes were named  according to subfamily membership. subfamilies were designated by letters starting with "a" and ending with "y" . within subfamilies, olfcs were numbered sequentially according to genomic position, if known. the new nomenclature showing subfamily membership and correspondence to previously-identified zebrafish olfc genes is shown in supplementary materials .

genomic distribution of zebrafish olfc genes
previous studies have demonstrated that v2r and olfc genes are clustered in the rodent and fugu genomes, respectively  <cit> . in the present study, we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> identified zebrafish olfc genes map to known chromosomal locations . fifty seven genes reside in three clusters, with  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> genes on chromosome 11; one gene each localizes to chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  from our analysis of the zv <dig> genome assembly, there is little evidence for large segmental duplications of receptor-containing loci; we find only a few instances of apparent interchromosomal duplications resulting in subfamily members residing on two chromosomes . in most cases, genes within a given subfamily are found in the same chromosomal cluster and share a common transcriptional orientation. together these observations suggest tandem duplication as the primary mechanism for expansion of the olfc gene repertoire.

a previous analysis placed the zebrafish olfc genes on ten chromosomes, with two major clusters of  <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> genes on chromosome  <dig>  and none on chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . however, in the present analysis using the more recent zv <dig> genome assembly, we found that the olfc genes with identifiable chromosomal locations map only to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 20; many of the genes localized by hashiguchi and nishida  <cit>  to the seven other chromosomes were partial sequences that ultimately map to the major clusters on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in the updated zv <dig> genome assembly. in addition, hashiguchi and nishida identified two possible instances of recent tandem duplications  <cit> : one within the cluster on chromosome  <dig> resulting in a near-perfect  <dig> kb duplication with  <dig> olfc genes, and another between chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  yielding an apparent  <dig> kb duplication with  <dig> genes. however, our analysis of these regions using the zv <dig>  zv <dig>  zv <dig> and zv <dig> assemblies indicates that these apparent duplications represent artifacts caused by errors in the zv <dig> genome assembly. with the exception of  <dig> pseudogenes, all of the  <dig> olfc sequences identified previously  <cit>  were detected with our gene mining pipeline and all of them  are accounted for in our analysis. largely consistent with our gene predictions and chromosomal mapping, a more recent report by hashiguchi and nishida  <cit>  based on the zv <dig> assembly identified  <dig> zebrafish olfc sequences  that were localized to chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  we attribute the minor discrepancies between  <cit>  and our study to differences in the zv <dig> and zv <dig> zebrafish genome assemblies.

phylogeny of zebrafish olfc genes
we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the zebrafish olfc genes in order to determine the relationships between members of this gene family. to this end, phylogenetic trees of the  <dig> full-length olfc sequences  and other c family gpcrs were constructed using maximum likelihood or neighbor joining algorithms . figure  <dig> shows the results of a phylogenetic reconstruction using maximum likelihood analysis, which classifies the full-length zebrafish olfc genes into monophyletic clades representing  <dig> subfamilies showing on average 46% inter-subfamily identity. assignment of genes at the subfamily level is identical using either maximum likelihood or neighbor joining methods, although some differences are manifested at deeper branches . the subfamilies in turn cluster into  <dig> larger groups: group i, the largest group, consisting of  <dig> intact genes and  <dig> full-length pseudogenes; group ii, consisting of a single intact gene; and group iii, containing one intact gene plus a full-length pseudogene. all olfc groups form clades that are clearly distinct from the casr, mglur, and t1r-like taste receptor families. group i and group ii genes reside on a common branch of the phylogenetic tree; their proximity to the calcium sensing receptor  suggests a previous duplication and expansion from a most recent common ancestral gene  shared by the present-day casr.

interestingly, group iii – which contains olfca <dig>  an amino acid receptor activated by glutamate  <cit>  – is divergent from group i and group ii. reconstructions using either maximum likelihood  or neighbor joining  place group iii closer to the putative taste receptors than to the group i and group ii olfc receptors, suggesting an mrca for the t1r and group iii receptors not shared with the group i or group ii receptors. however, based on amino acid sequence similarity alone, group iii is roughly equidistant from group i/group ii  and the family of t1r-like putative taste receptors . while this apparent discrepancy could be explained by the longer branch lengths of the t1r family, suggestive of accelerated functional/sequence divergence, conclusions about the origins of the group iii olfc receptors should be tempered by these latter observations.

comparison of fish olfc and mammalian v2r receptors
to gain additional insight into the evolution of the olfc receptor repertoire, we compared the zebrafish olfc sequences to mammalian v2r receptors, olfc receptors identified in two other teleost fish species , and other c family gpcrs. phylogenetic trees were constructed using intact genes from zebrafish , mouse , goldfish , and fugu  . a phylogenetic tree generated using maximum likelihood is shown in figure  <dig>  this analysis reveals that the major group of fish olfc genes  is distinct from the largest set of mammalian v2r sequences, which comprise two related clades designated here as group iv and group v . thus, the fish group i olfc receptors and mammalian group iv/v v2r receptors appear to have diverged significantly from a common ancestral gene.

group ii contains genes from zebrafish , goldfish , fugu , and mouse . in addition to their sequence similarity, members of this group are expressed broadly in their respective organisms' sensory epithelium  <cit> , reflecting a conserved mode of gene regulation. group iii appears to contain a single receptor in the zebrafish , goldfish , fugu , or mouse ; mammalian gprc6a shows about 40% amino acid similarity to the corresponding fish receptors in this group  <cit> . the zebrafish, goldfish and mouse receptors in group iii have all been shown to be activated by amino acid ligands  <cit> . however, while the zebrafish and goldfish genes are expressed in the olfactory epithelium, mammalian gprc6a is expressed in a number of non-olfactory tissues, but not in the olfactory system  <cit> . thus, while these receptors appear to be orthologous, their regulation in tissue-specific gene expression has diverged significantly between fish and mammals.

the  <dig> identified fugu olfc receptors  can be placed into  <dig> of the  <dig> subfamilies defined above for the zebrafish . four fugu receptors  cannot be classified into these subfamilies and thus form four fugu-specific subfamilies. we conclude from this comparison that the olfc family had already diverged into the present-day subfamilies in the most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid  and pufferfish lineages, prior to the cyprinid-pufferfish split . subsequent differential gene expansion  and gene loss  probably occurred following speciation of these two teleost lineages.

patterns of sequence conservation and divergence implicate the olfc receptors as a family of amino acid-binding proteins
we next examined the patterns of sequence conservation and divergence within the zebrafish olfc receptor family in order to gain insights into the possible functions of these receptors. a sequence logo created from the alignment of full-length zebrafish olfc amino acid sequences highlights a number of conserved motifs among members of the family . in addition to the clear conservation of the cysteine residues of the cysteine-rich domain and heptahelical transmembrane  domains , several stretches of residues in the ligand-binding n-terminal domain  are also conserved. these ntd residues largely correspond to secondary structure elements such as the core alpha helices in lobe  <dig> and the beta strands in lobe  <dig>  as well as sites predicted to interact with bound ligand . overall, the ntd shows less conservation than the cysteine-rich and tm domains, consistent with these latter domains' roles in receptor structure and coupling to intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> .

what clues about receptor function or ligand specificity might be gleaned from an analysis of sequence conservation within the olfc receptor family? it is instructive to consider this question in the context of the structure of c family gpcrs. the ligand-binding ntd of c family gpcrs is thought to adopt a conformation resembling a bilobate clamshell-like structure  <cit> . stabilization of the closed conformation of the clamshell – through interactions between bound ligand and the inner faces of the two lobes  – leads to receptor activation. for amino acid-binding receptors, the binding pocket formed by the two lobes of the clamshell can be divided into two regions: a proximal pocket, comprising residues that interact with the glycine moiety of the amino acid ligand , and a distal pocket, comprising residues that interact with the ligand's r group side chain  <cit> . studies on a wide variety of amino acid-binding proteins have identified a core "signature" motif of  <dig> residues within the proximal binding pocket that participate in critical interactions with the amino acid ligand . thus, the presence of the ligand-binding signature motif in a given receptor would be consistent with the receptor's possible function in amino acid sensing. an additional  <dig> conserved residues predicted to be involved in structural interactions in the hinge region have also been identified in the amino acid receptors . although still subject to experimental validation, together with the core 5-site motif these latter  <dig> sites have been proposed to comprise an  <dig> residue signature of amino acid receptors  <cit> .

we have shown previously  <cit>  that the amino acid-binding core signature motif is present in goldfish receptor  <dig> , a group iii olfc receptor that is activated by amino acids  <cit> ; mutagenesis of any one of the  <dig> signature motif residues in receptor  <dig>  results in a profound decrease in receptor activation by ligand  <cit> . the corresponding  <dig> amino acids in olfca <dig> , the zebrafish ortholog of goldfish receptor  <dig>  that is also activated by amino acids, are fully conserved  <cit> . we were therefore interested in determining to what extent the amino acid-binding signature motif is conserved within the zebrafish olfc receptor family, and by inference whether the olfc receptors may constitute a family of amino acid receptors.

we addressed this issue using two tools for mapping amino acid substitutions to relevant sites in the receptor structure:  a sequence logo representation of residues predicted from our previous structure-function studies  <cit>  to be involved in amino acid binding, including the aforementioned  <dig> residue signature motif , and  a representation of conservation and divergence overlaid on our structural model for the ligand-binding ntd of olfca <dig> . three salient features are evident from this analysis. first, the  <dig> residue signature motif  is highly conserved in the zebrafish olfc family , as well as in the fugu olfc receptors . similarly, a high level of conservation is seen for residues forming the surface of the proximal binding pocket . these observations suggest that the olfc receptors as a group are capable of binding to amino acids and their derivatives. second, a sequence logo of the mouse v2r receptors  shows that, with the exception of the group ii v2r <dig> receptor, the amino acid-binding signature motif is absent from the mammalian v2r receptors. since the signature motif is strictly required for amino acid binding in all c family gpcrs identified to date  <cit> , group iv and group v v2r receptors have likely evolved to receive non-amino acid stimuli; the probable functional divergence of the v2r and olfc receptors mirrors the phylogenetic divergence of these two receptor families . what, then, are the cognate ligands for the v2r receptors? recent studies have implicated the v2r receptors in detecting mhc peptides and other conspecific peptide cues  <cit> . we speculate that since such peptides are likely too large to fit within the conventional clamshell binding pocket, they may instead activate the receptor by allosteric interactions on the exterior of the ntd or cysteine-rich domain, similar to the allosteric activation of t1r sweet receptors by peptide sweeteners  <cit> . it should be noted that fish also appear to choose mating partners based on mhc haplotype, presumably via an olfactory-mediated process  <cit> ; the olfc receptors may therefore mediate chemoreception of peptide cues via such allosteric interactions, distinct from "orthosteric" ligand binding interactions within the conventional clamshell binding pocket.

finally, residues predicted to comprise the distal binding pocket – i.e., those interacting with the amino acid's r group side chain – are not conserved within the olfc receptor family . together with the conservation of proximal pocket residues , these observations suggest that the olfc receptor family has evolved to detect and discriminate a diverse spectrum of amino acids and/or amino acid derivatives. consistent with this multiplicity of putative amino acid receptors, physiological studies have provided evidence for multiple, overlapping pathways used by the fish olfactory system to detect this class of chemical cues  <cit> . interestingly, behavioral studies in catfish  <cit>  have shown that fish are able to discriminate between amino acids. the future elucidation of the ligand specificities of individual, cloned olfc receptors should allow an understanding of how this receptor family subserves the physiologic and behavioral discrimination of amino acid-based chemical structures.

adaptive evolution of olfc receptors
our analysis of sequence conservation within the receptor structure revealed a striking degree of divergence in a considerable portion of the ntd – the region of c family gpcrs responsible for ligand binding  <cit> . while sequence conservation is usually a clear indicator of important function , lack of conservation is more difficult to interpret. on the one hand, the observed variation might represent relaxed selective pressure consistent with lack of sequence-related function. for example, some loop regions might only function to connect secondary structural elements – their length being important but not their particular sequence. the observed sequence diversity could therefore be the result of genetic drift, with polymorphisms in the population being fixed at a rate consistent with the absence of selective pressure. on the other hand, adaptive evolutionary processes may have driven diversification of protein function  via selection on specific residues or protein regions.

we used the relative frequency of non-synonymous vs. synonymous codon substitutions to assess the selective processes acting on the olfc receptor genes  <cit> . in the absence of positive or negative selection, the number of non-synonymous changes relative to the number of possible non-synonymous changes  is equal to the number of synonymous changes relative to the number of possible synonymous changes  – i.e., dn/ds =  <dig>  significant deviations of dn/ds from unity reflect selection on the sequence; a dn/ds ratio >  <dig> indicates that a region has undergone positive selection, whereas a dn/ds ratio <  <dig> indicates negative or "purifying" selection  <cit> . for the present analysis, we aligned a set of  <dig> full-length intact zebrafish olfc coding sequences and calculated dn and ds values, as previously described  <cit> . we first made these calculations separately for two broad regions of the receptor: the ntd and the combined cysteine-rich plus tm domains . both the ntd and ctd appear to be under negative or purifying selection . however, the ntd displays a significantly higher average dn/ds ratio than the ctd . these observations are consistent with a scenario in which there is an overall relaxed negative selection on the n-terminal sequence, which may have permitted olfc receptors to adapt their binding affinities to different odorants.

what evolutionary processes may have acted on individual sites within the receptor structure? we hypothesize that highly conserved sites within the proximal binding pocket – i.e., those involved in binding the common glycine moiety of all amino acid ligands – might be expected to have undergone negative or purifying selection. conversely, sites comprising the distal pocket may have undergone positive selection as the receptors evolved to recognize amino acids with different side chains. to test these ideas, we performed a site-by-site analysis of dn/ds ratios using the single likelihood ancestor counting  package  <cit>  , as described previously  <cit> . a p value derived from a two-tailed extended binomial distribution was used to assess significance at each site. tests on simulated data  show that p values less than or equal to  <dig>  identify nearly all true positives with a false positive rate generally below the nominal p value; for actual data, the number of true positives at a given false positive rate is lower.

most sites in the receptor appear to be under negative selection , including all of the identified proximal binding pocket sites. interestingly, many  of the predicted distal pocket sites appear to be under relaxed or neutral selection . these results are also shown overlaid on the structural model for olfca <dig> . in this representation, surface residues predicted to interact with the bound ligand's glycine moiety show clear evidence of negative selection , whereas those lining the distal pocket show a relaxation of this negative selection . together these observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the proximal pocket sites are under strong purifying selection, which has maintained the ability of the olfc receptors to bind amino acid ligands. the apparent relaxation of negative selection on distal pocket sites may reflect the adaptation of these receptors to recognize different amino acids or their derivatives.

overall, our site-by-site analysis of dn/ds ratios reveals a striking absence of sites exhibiting signs of positive selection. this may be due to the dominating influence of negative or purifying selection throughout the receptor coding region. alternatively, since non-synonymous substitutions are thought to occur only sporadically over evolutionary time, the signatures of less recent substitutions may no longer be evident. in addition, the power to detect adaptive evolutionary events at the level of individual codons decreases in proportion to the time since the event occurred due to saturation by synonymous substitutions. thus, our inability to detect such events may indicate that they occurred early in the evolution of this gene family.

CONCLUSIONS
we describe here a comprehensive analysis of the olfc receptor family – the repertoire of c family gpcrs expressed in the zebrafish olfactory system. fifty four intact genes comprise this family, which by phylogenetic analysis is distinct from other c family gpcrs. a comparison with olfc receptors identified in fugu suggests that the  <dig> present-day subfamilies identified in zebrafish and fugu probably existed in the most recent common ancestor of the cyprinid and pufferfish lineages. interestingly, the major group of fish olfc receptors is distinct from the mammalian vomeronasal v2r receptors, suggesting that these two groups of genes evolved to accommodate different chemosensory cues and/or physiological functions in the fish and mammalian lineages. consistent with this notion, our analysis of sequence conservation and selective pressure indicates that the zebrafish olfc family retains a binding pocket signature motif common to all amino acid receptors characterized to date  <cit> ; this signature motif is similarly conserved in the fugu olfc receptors. thus, the fish olfc receptors likely evolved to allow the detection and discrimination of amino acids, which are potent olfactory cues for teleost fish  <cit> . by way of contrast, the amino acid-binding signature motif is not present in the vast majority of v2r receptors, suggesting that the mammalian v2r receptors became specialized to detect chemosensory cues of a chemical composition different from amino acids. the present results lay the foundation for future studies aimed at elucidating the ligand specificities and structure-function relationships of individual olfc receptors.
