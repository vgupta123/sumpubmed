BACKGROUND
the origin of pancreatic islet cells has been the subject of study and controversy since before the discovery of insulin  <cit> . histological and ultrastructural studies suggested that islets arise from exocrine ducts during embryogenesis, but whether such exocrine-endocrine conversion continued after birth remained a matter of controversy  <cit> . nucleotide analogues have recently been used to identify and trace the fate of proliferating cells, but these studies have been interpreted both for and against the hypothesis of new islet cell differentiation, or neogenesis, in adulthood  <cit> . similarly, cell culture studies have provided evidence for and against neogenesis, but extrapolating these findings in vivo remains a challenge  <cit> . nonetheless, determining whether β-cell neogenesis occurs in vivo will inform efforts to replenish β-cells lost in diabetes: if neogenesis can occur in mice, it might be possible in the human organ as well. evidence against neogenesis would encourage more aggressive efforts elsewhere, such as the derivation of β-cells from human embryonic stem cells.

genetic lineage tracing techniques have transformed our understanding of pancreas developmental biology, providing insights either unavailable from or contradictory to prior studies of fixed tissue  <cit> . for example, using the cre-loxp system to monitor the fate of cells expressing the acinar protein carboxypeptidase a <dig>  has revealed that these cells comprise a self-renewing, multipotent progenitor pool during mid-embryogenesis  <cit> . at later stages, cpa1+ cells become restricted to the acinar compartment, and lineage tracing of adult acinar cells indicates that they do not contribute to β-cells  <cit> . other lineage tracing studies similarly cast doubt on the neogenesis model; for example, it is now appreciated that all islet cell types arise from neurog3+ precursor cells  <cit> , yet neurog3+ cells are usually not detected after birth  <cit> . similarly, a key study of adult β-cell expansion and self-renewal suggests that these processes reflect division of existing β-cells rather than neogenesis  <cit> , a conclusion reinforced by subsequent independent findings  <cit> .

nonetheless, without a cre line capable of marking duct cells, these studies could not exclude a minor ductal contribution to β-cells. furthermore, they have not addressed the rapid expansion of β-cell mass that occurs shortly after birth  <cit> , which may derive in part from neogenesis  <cit> . the ideal tool to address these questions would be a mouse line in which ducts can be inducibly marked at a specific time point, and their ability to contribute to β-cells determined at later stages: a cellular "pulse-chase" experiment  <cit> . such mice could also clarify the origin of new β-cells formed in regeneration models, such as duct ligation and partial pancreatectomy, which may involve neogenesis  <cit> 

four transgenic mouse lines have recently been described in studies aimed at addressing this issue. inada et al.  <cit>  generated mice in which either cre or its tamoxifen -inducible derivative creer™ is driven by the promoter of carbonic anhydrase ii , a marker of adult duct cells. this study concluded that ducts continue to give rise to islets after birth, and that neogenesis is dramatically increased after duct ligation  <cit> . means et al.  <cit>  used a knock-in approach to target a similar tamoxifen-inducible creert molecule to the duct-specific cytokeratin- <dig>  gene. k19creert labels many duct cells in neonatal and adult mice, as well as a small fraction of islet cells due to "leaky" recombinase expression in islets themselves. when k19creert was activated by tm treatment at birth, islet labeling at one week of age was no greater than expected from this background activity, suggesting that new islet cells generated in the interim did not derive from the more robustly-labeled duct population  <cit> . finally, solar et al.  <cit>  generated a bac transgenic in which tm-dependent creert <dig> is targeted to the first exon of hnf1β, a transcription factor expressed selectively in embryonic and adult duct cells. this study indicated that hnf1β+ duct cells give rise to β-cells prior to birth but not thereafter, even in the context of injury models such as duct ligation  <cit> . the apparent contradiction between these studies, in particular those using caii- and hnf1β-driven cre transgenes, suggests that additional markers should be sought out and exploited for their capacity to label duct cells, thereby providing independent evidence for or against postnatal neogenesis  <cit> .

the gene mucin <dig>  transmembrane  is expressed throughout the ductal network in both the embryonic and adult pancreas, and excluded from islets  <cit> . we have generated mice in which the muc <dig> gene is tagged with an ires-creert <dig> cassette, permitting the inducible labeling of muc1+ cells. we find that this line also marks embryonic and postnatal acinar cells, reflecting endogenous muc <dig> expression, but is completely excluded from islets in short-term "pulse" experiments. in the embryo, muc1+ cells give rise to endocrine cells as well as their neurog3+precursors, formally confirming that islets originate from fetal ducts. following birth, however, we find that the muc1+ lineage completely fails to contribute to new islet α- or β-cells, indicating that both the expansion and homeostasis of these cell types occurs independent of contribution from exocrine ducts or acini. these results argue against a major role for neogenesis in the normal postnatal pancreas, and set the groundwork for studies of potential neogenesis during regeneration.

RESULTS
targeting creert <dig> to the muc <dig> locus
to determine if the muc <dig> locus could be exploited to mark ducts, we evaluated its expression in the embryonic and adult pancreas. we find that muc <dig> is widely expressed at e <dig> , when most pancreatic cells are still undifferentiated progenitors . as embryogenesis proceeds, muc <dig> expression persists in the branching epithelial network , and it is expressed by all ductal cells of the mature organ . another duct marker, cytokeratin- <dig> , is undetectable prior to e <dig>  . interestingly, muc <dig> expression appears to decrease as duct caliber increases, opposite to ck <dig> . nonetheless, we have not observed, at any stage, a muc1-negative cell incorporated within a duct structure.

embryonic islet precursors express the transcription factor neurogenin <dig> , and are considered to arise from primitive duct-like cells  <cit> . we find that neurog <dig> expression localizes within or in close proximity to muc1+ cells at e <dig> , consistent with a ductal origin for islet cells . while neurog <dig> expression is not detectable in adults, muc <dig> remains expressed throughout the ductal network of the pancreas, including large ducts as well as fine terminal branches within acini . importantly, muc <dig> expression is excluded from islet cells during embryogenesis as well as in the mature organ . altogether, muc <dig> appears to satisfy our requirements for a cre driver line to study islet neogenesis: it is expressed in all duct cells, embryonic and adult, and excluded from differentiated islets.

as detailed in the methods, we generated a muc1ires-creert <dig> allele  by gene targeting, introducing an ires-creert <dig> cassette after the endogenous stop codon of the muc <dig> locus . the creert <dig> protein is a tamoxifen -dependent recombinase that provides temporal control of cre activity  <cit> , which should allow us to investigate the differentiation potential of embryonic and postnatal duct cells. muc1ic <dig> heterozygous and homozygous mice are viable and fertile .

muc1ic <dig> marks exocrine cells in the adult pancreas
to determine whether muc1ic <dig> marks ducts, we performed short-term labeling experiments with the cre-dependent eyfp reporter strain, rosa26eyfp  <cit> . we induced recombination by treating adult  muc1ic2/+;rosa26eyfp/+ mice with a single dose of  <dig> mg tamoxifen. after a two-day "chase" period, we found the eyfp lineage label not only in cytokeratin-19+ duct cells , as expected, but also within amylase+ acinar cells , indicating that this cre line is active in both duct and acinar cells.  an identical labeling distribution was observed using a different reporter strain, rosa26lacz  <cit>  . in these and other experiments, all muc1ic2-labeled cells were found to be e-cadherin+ , indicating that they represent pancreatic parenchymal cells rather than connective tissue or vasculature.

having observed the lineage label in acinar cells, we wanted to confirm that these cells actually express muc <dig>  after enzymatic dissociation and immunostaining of isolated acini, we detect muc <dig> not only within small acini, comprised entirely of amylase+ cells, but also in single amylase+ cells . confocal imaging of wholemount stained pancreata confirmed that muc <dig> protein localizes to the apical poles of acinar cells, and is readily detected within individual acini that lack centroacinar cells  <cit>  . since this antibody recognizes the intracellular domain of the muc <dig> protein  <cit> , the observed staining is unlikely to reflect shed or contaminating muc <dig> from duct or centroacinar cells. in situ hybridization studies have similarly revealed muc <dig> expression in both acinar and duct cells of the human pancreas  <cit> , and we conclude that the acinar labeling observed with muc1ic <dig> reflects endogenous muc <dig> expression.

we also determined the relative distribution of muc1ic2-labeled cells between small , medium  and large  ducts . we found that muc1ic2-labeled cells were present in all three duct types, with slightly lower labeling within interlobular ducts than those of smaller caliber . this labeling distribution is consistent with the distribution of muc <dig> protein itself, described above , and suggests that muc1ic2-driven recombination can occur in any muc1-expressing cell.

examining tm-untreated 4- <dig> month muc1ic2/+;rosa26eyfp/+ and muc1ic2/+;rosa26lacz/+ mice  revealed a background recombination rate of less than  <dig> % , confirming that this line exhibits stringent tamoxifen dependence. furthermore, we never observed lineage-labeled endocrine cells in our short-term experiments. muc1ic <dig> labeling is thus tm-dependent, as expected, and extends throughout the exocrine pancreas . although tm-induced muc1ic <dig> labeling is relatively sparse , its distribution closely matches that of muc <dig> itself, and appears to represent a random sampling of the exocrine pancreas. as muc1ic <dig> does not directly label islet cells, it can be used to detect potential exocrine-derived neogenesis.

islet cells arise from embryonic muc1+ cells
to determine whether muc1+ cells contribute to islet neogenesis in utero, we administered tamoxifen to pregnant females carrying muc1ic2/+; rosa26eyfp/+ embryos. these experiments yielded a very low overall labeling rate , possibly due to reduced amounts of tm entering fetal circulation. to increase the cellular cre concentration, therefore, we used homozygous muc1ic2/ic2; rosa26eyfp/+ embryos for all in utero labeling experiments. muc1ic2/ic2;rosa26eyfp/+ embryos were labeled with a single maternal dose of tm  at different embryonic stages: e <dig> , e <dig>  or e <dig> . all embryos were analyzed at e <dig>  . as expected, muc1ic <dig> labels fetal ducts at all these timepoints , albeit at low frequencies . consistent with its labeling pattern in the adult pancreas, muc1ic <dig> marks a similar proportion of fetal acinar cells as well . furthermore, we observe eyfp lineage-labeling of insulin+ β-cells and glucagon+ α-cells in all of these pancreata , indicating an origin within the muc1+ exocrine compartment. our experimental design therefore identifies potential neogenesis even from a sparsely-labeled population. as β-cell numbers increase exponentially between e <dig>  and e <dig>   <cit> , ~100-fold total, most of the β-cells analyzed in this experiment would have been born since tamoxifen was administered. that we find comparable muc1ic <dig> lineage labeling in β-cells and exocrine cells  suggests that most of the new β-cells arose via exocrine-derived neogenesis.

to further confirm that muc1ic <dig> is not active in fetal islets themselves, we performed short-term  pulse-chase labeling of embryos at e <dig>  or e <dig> . we could easily detect the lineage label in the embryonic ductal system as well as in neuog3+ cells , but failed to detect any labeled hormone-producing cells . the short-term labeling of neurog3+ cells agrees with the co-expression of neurog <dig> and muc <dig> in embryonic ducts , and the lack of short-term islet labeling confirms that the later appearance of labeled endocrine cells reflects differentiation from exocrine tissue.

finally, to determine whether fetal muc1+ cells contribute to adult islets, we administered  <dig> mg tm to pregnant females at e <dig>  and analyzed labeling at weaning age . we found labeling of both β-cells  and α-cells , present in mature islet structures . as expected, lineage label also persists in adult duct cells, and appears to be distributed equally among various classes of duct structures .

altogether, these results strongly suggest that  embryonic muc1+ duct cells give rise to all segments of the adult ductal network,  muc <dig> is not expressed by endocrine cells and  mature islet cells arise from neurog3+ precursors within the embryonic muc1+ ductal network. these results represent direct evidence that endocrine cells arise from embryonic ducts, but they leave open the possibility that embryonic muc1ic <dig> labeling actually marks a ductal stem cell-like population, which continues to give rise to new islet cells after birth. we therefore turned our attention to the differentiation potential of postnatal muc1+ cells.

muc1+ exocrine cells do not undergo endocrine differentiation after birth
we performed three experiments to determine whether the muc1+ exocrine compartment contributes to islet cells after birth. in experiment  <dig>  we administered  <dig> mg tamoxifen to young adult  muc1ic2/+; rosa26eyfp/+ mice, and assayed the potential contribution of labeled cells to either exocrine or endocrine cells after  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> days . we observed an overall labeling efficiency  of ~24% in these experiments, which included ~30% labeling of acinar and ~10% labeling of duct cells . as our short-term labeling experiments never revealed detectable lineage marking of islet cells , we focused our quantitative analyses on the  <dig> d and  <dig> d chase periods. we counted randomly-chosen fields of β-cells and α-cells, scoring separately for number of insulin+ or glucagon+ cells, number of eyfp+ cells, and number of double-positive  cells. in fact, after scoring several thousand cells positive for each marker , we never observed a single β-cell or α-cell positive for eyfp, suggesting that new islet cells do not arise in significant numbers from adult muc1+ exocrine cells.

three "pulse-chase" lineage-labeling experiments were performed, as described in the text, in which tamoxifen was administered  and mice sacrificed after chase periods of 7- <dig> days. for each sample, we counted total cells per field , acinar cells  and duct cells , as well as the number of cells double-positive for these markers and for the lineage tracer. from these counts, we derived the labeling efficiency  of total cells , acinar  and duct  cells. shown are summary data for every mouse analyzed, as well as mean values +/- standard error. nd, not determined.

as described in the text, mice subjected to "pulse-chase" labeling with muc1ic <dig> were analyzed for potential contribution of lineage-marked cells to insulin+ β-cells or glucagon+ α-cells . indicated are the total number of cells scored as positive for lineage label , as well as the total number of insulin+ and glucagon+ cells scored in the same fields. in no case did we observe a lineage label-positive endocrine cell. nd, not determined.

to determine if muc1+ cells contribute to the rapid expansion of islet cell numbers after birth  <cit> , we performed experiment  <dig>  in which we induced recombination in muc1ic2/+; rosa26lacz/+ neonates by administration of tamoxifen to nursing mothers . we sacrificed mice  <dig> or  <dig> days after treatment , and performed immunofluorescence to detect lacz lineage marker within the exocrine and endocrine compartments . we found an overall labeling efficiency of ~10% in these experiments, including ~15% of acinar cells and ~4% of duct cells . as in experiment  <dig>  however, despite scoring several thousand cells for each marker, we did not observe a single lacz+ β-cell or α-cell .

previous studies indicate that acinar cells do not contribute to islets after birth  <cit> , and experiment  <dig> suggests that neonatal duct cells are also excluded from the islet lineage. this interpretation hinges on relatively infrequent ductal labeling, which could have hidden a low level of duct-derived neogenesis. to increase the duct labeling frequency, we performed experiment  <dig>  in which we directly injected newborn muc1ic2/+;  rosa26eyfp/+ pups with tamoxifen . upon sacrifice,  <dig> days after tm administration, we found increased overall labeling compared to mice that received maternal tm . importantly, the duct labeling frequency was increased to 10%, with equal distribution among interlobular, intralobular and intercalated ducts . nonetheless, we did not observe any labeled β-cells or α-cells, despite scoring several thousand cells positive for each marker .

these analyses suggest an upper limit to the contribution of neogenesis to postnatal islet growth. β-cell mass has been reported to expand between 4- and 10-fold in the first 2- <dig> weeks after birth  <cit> . if we assume a five-fold expansion between p <dig> and p <dig>  we can infer that ~80% of the β-cells scored in experiment  <dig> were "new" since p <dig> . if all of these had been derived from muc1ic2-labeled duct cells, given a duct labeling index of ~10% , we would have expected to observe roughly  <dig> labeled β-cells. as we observed zero, we conclude that ≤1% of all β-cells generated after birth could have arisen from labeled ducts . altogether, experiments 1- <dig> fail to reveal duct-to-islet transdifferentiation after birth.

discussion
at birth, the mammalian β-cell changes from a metabolic passenger to the driver of glucose homeostasis. based on our results and those of solar et al.  <cit> , we propose that the mechanisms controlling β-cell mass also change at birth, from a fetal period of new differentiation, or neogenesis, to a mature state of self-renewal . to detect this transition, we performed a direct comparison of duct and acinar cell lineages before and after birth. we provide formal proof -- confirming prior studies of histology and gene expression -- that islets arise from embryonic muc1+ ducts. from birth onwards, however, we find no evidence for a ductal origin of new β-cells, and we propose that postnatal β-cell expansion and homeostasis normally occur without contribution from ducts or acini.

we had intended, in creating the muc1ic <dig> allele, to specifically address the differentiation potential of duct cells. instead, we find that muc1ic <dig> labels both acinar and duct cells, at all stages examined, and that muc <dig> protein is readily detected within acinar cells. nonetheless, we can treat the labeling of postnatal acinar cells as "background," as acinar-to-islet transdifferentiation does not occur after birth  <cit> . cells expressing the acinar enzyme cpa <dig> do behave as multipotent "tip cell" progenitors prior to e <dig> , but are thereafter restricted to the acinar lineage  <cit> . as muc1+ cells still contribute to islets at e <dig>  and e <dig>  , we propose that islet differentiation competence normally shifts from muc1+/cpa1+ tips to muc1+/cpa1-negative "trunks" after e <dig> , before being lost entirely at birth .

another recently developed mouse line, k19creert, in which creert is targeted to the cytokeratin- <dig> locus, drives tm-dependent recombination in inter- and intralobular ducts  <cit> . unlike muc1ic <dig>  k19creert does not label distal intercalated ducts, and is active in a small fraction of islet cells. nonetheless, preliminary experiments reported using k19creert provide independent evidence supporting our model: tm treatment at birth results in ≥10% labeling of ducts after one week, but <1% labeling of islets, equivalent to the direct activity of this line in islet cells themselves  <cit> .

while this manuscript was in preparation, solar and colleagues  <cit>  published a study using another exocrine creert <dig> line, driven by the hnf1β locus. unlike muc1ic <dig>  this driver is not active in acini, and labels a higher fraction of duct cells postnatally . as with muc1ic <dig>  lineage-tracing of hnf1β+ cells revealed duct-to-islet differentiation prior to birth, but none thereafter. further experiments by these investigators indicate that such differentiation does not occur in the context of injury and regeneration  <cit> , as previously believed  <cit> .  our data provide further evidence against postnatal duct-to-islet differentiation in the healthy pancreas, although it remains to be determined if injury can induce neogenesis from muc1ic2-expressing population.

the hnf1β-creert <dig> and muc1ic <dig> lineage tracing results contradict those obtained with a cre transgene driven by the carbonic anhydrase ii promoter   <cit> . using rosa26lacz reporter mice to detect recombination  <cit> , these authors report that caii-cre drives duct-restricted recombination beginning at e <dig> , but labels roughly 15% of β-cells at four weeks of age. we cannot offer an obvious explanation for this discrepancy; given the number of β-cells that we counted, we should have detected such a robust contribution from muc1ic2-labeled duct cells. one possibility is that caii-cre-catalyzed recombination actually begins prior to birth, when neurog3+ cells are still present  <cit> , but that lacz expression cannot be detected until one or more days after birth. in fact, half of the newborn pancreata examined in this study already exhibited at least some labeled β-cells , indicating prenatal recombination  <cit> . these authors have also generated a caii-creert transgene, which could be used to follow postnatal labeling specifically, although their experiments with these mice revealed surprisingly high levels of tamoxifen and cre-independent lacz expression in adult islets  <cit> .

alternatively, a subpopulation of duct cells with the capacity for islet differentiation might escape labeling by muc1ic <dig>  k19creert and hnf1β-creert <dig>  but not by caii-cre . indeed, as neither our cre driver nor those described by others labels a majority of postnatal duct cells  <cit> , the possibility of a substantial unmarked subpopulation is impossible to exclude formally. as three independent and distinct cre transgenes have yielded identical conclusions, however, the burden of evidence would appear to weigh against postnatal islet neogenesis.

with respect to muc1ic <dig> in particular, we note that although its recombination efficiency in utero is even lower than after birth, our experimental approach still identifies islet cells arising from the sparsely labeled embryonic exocrine compartment. furthermore, we have never observed a muc1-negative duct cell , nor is there evidence for anatomical exclusion of muc1ic2-labeled cells within the ductal network . we also do not observe any obvious change in muc <dig> expression or distribution between embryonic stages, when muc1ic <dig> does label endocrine cells, and postnatal stages, when it does not. an obvious transition that does occur perinatally is the extinction of neurog <dig> expression, which itself weighs against the persistence of duct-to-islet differentiation after birth  <cit> .

from a physiological perspective, it might make sense that expansion of β-cells after birth involves a mechanism independent of neogenesis, as postnatal β-cells must contend with metabolic demands from which embryonic progenitor cells are buffered. in fact, numerous knockout mouse studies indicate the existence of postnatal-specific mechanisms to control β-cell mass  <cit> . furthermore, recent studies suggest that expansion of β-cell mass in adults, in response to β-cell damage or increased insulin demand, occurs via proliferation rather than neogenesis  <cit> . potential exceptions to this rule have been described, including partial pancreatectomy and duct ligation, in which development of new β-cells is accompanied by the re-appearance of neurog3-expressing cells within the ductal epithelium  <cit> . studies using hnf1β-creert <dig> to mark pre-existing duct cells in such models did not detect contribution to new β-cells, however  <cit> . the muc1ic <dig> line is well suited for similar experiments and, as a tool to mark cells throughout the exocrine pancreas, it should complement and extend results obtained by others.

CONCLUSIONS
our results constitute formal evidence that insulin-producing β-cells, and other endocrine cells of the mature pancreatic islet, derive from ductal cells of the embryonic organ. furthermore, the ability to trace the lineage of cells expressing muc <dig> at different timepoints allows us to compare their differentiation potential before and after birth. we find that muc1-expressing cells lose the capacity for islet differentiation postnatally, prior to the major increase in β-cell numbers that occurs in juvenile mice. these data add to an emerging model for control of β-cell mass, driven by developmentally-programmed neogenesis in the womb and physiologically-regulated proliferation after birth.
