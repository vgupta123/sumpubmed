BACKGROUND
endoplasmic reticulum  lipid raft associated proteins  were originally discovered by screening with antibodies prepared against isolated lipid raft proteins from human myelomonocytic cells  <cit> . erlins associate with detergent resistant membranes but are located in the er membrane, suggesting they are components of lipid raft-like domains in the er membrane, not the plasma membrane. erlins belong to the group of stomatin/prohibitin/flotillin/hflk/c  domain containing proteins  <cit> . members of this protein group differ in subcellular location and function, but share certain biochemical properties such as detergent resistant membrane association and the propensity to form oligomers  <cit> .

erlins are conserved in both plants and animals  <cit>  but so far erlin proteins have only been studied experimentally in mammalian cell lines  <cit> . interestingly, no erlin homologues are found in yeast or in drosophila melanogaster. while c. elegans and a. thaliana have only one erlin gene, vertebrate species have two closely related erlin homologues  <cit> . for instance, human erlin- <dig> and erlin- <dig>  share ~80% identity at the amino acid level  <cit> . erlins form large  higher order multimers, which is absolutely dependent on a single phenylalanine residue  close to the c-terminus  <cit> .

biochemical studies in mammalian cell lines have revealed an important role for erlin proteins in targeting activated ip3rs for er-associated protein degradation   <cit> . erad mediates the degradation of er proteins by the cytosolic ubiquitin proteasome system  <cit> . the main function of erad is the removal of misfolded proteins from the er  <cit> , which is particularly important under conditions of er stress when protein folding is impaired  <cit> . another function of erad is to control levels and thus the activity of specific substrate proteins, including ip <dig> receptors  <cit> . ip <dig> receptors are calcium release channels in the er membrane, which become activated and open in response to ip <dig> binding  <cit> . upon sustained stimulation by certain ligands, activated ip <dig> receptors are targeted for erad, which is thought to provide a mechanism of desensitizing cells to ip <dig>  <cit> .

upon their activation, ip3rs become rapidly associated with erlin proteins  <cit> . blocking erlin expression by rna interference prevents degradation of activated ip <dig> receptors and increases ip3r levels under resting conditions. overexpression of wild type erlin proteins enhances ip3r turnover. in addition, erlin mutants defective in high mw complex formation disrupt erlin complexes and have a dominant-negative effect on ip3r erad  <cit> . this latter finding also shows that formation of multimeric complexes is required for erlin function. in addition, erlin proteins seem to play a rather minor role in erad of certain other model substrates  <cit> .

a frameshift mutation in the erlin- <dig> gene appears to cause a rare human autosomal recessive disorder characterized by progressive intellectual disability, motor dysfunction, joint contractures and vacuolization of leukocytes  <cit> . the frameshift mutation results in a truncated, likely dominant negative version of erlin- <dig> that is defective in high mw complex formation  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether defects in ip3r erad are the underlying cause of this disease phenotype. it is also possible that erlins could have some entirely unsuspected function.

we have turned to the nematode c. elegans to study erlin function in the context of an intact organism. c. elegans is an excellent model organism in which to study ip <dig> receptor signaling and erad. the c. elegans ip <dig> receptor itr- <dig>  which is highly similar to mammalian ip <dig> receptors, is expressed in a wide range of tissues  <cit> , where it regulates a number of rhythmic behaviours, such as defecation and ovulation  <cit> . itr- <dig> is also important during early embryonic development, where it controls migration of epidermal cells  <cit> . changes in itr- <dig> activity lead to altered defecation cycle length, reduced brood size and increased embryonic arrest  <cit> . many components of the erad pathway are also conserved between c. elegans and mammals  <cit> . mutations in proteins involved in erad can be easily detected in c. elegans as they increase er stress levels and increase sensitivity to agents that induce er stress  <cit> .

the present study represents the first characterization of the c. elegans erlin protein erl- <dig>  we examine general properties of erl- <dig>  such as biochemistry, subcellular location and expression pattern. a c. elegans strain carrying a chromosomal deletion in the erl- <dig> gene is used to examine the effect of erlin deficiency on overall phenotype, specific ip <dig> receptor dependent processes and response to er stress. overall, our findings provide no evidence that c. elegans erlins play a major role either in modulating ip3r activity or in erad.

RESULTS
the c. elegans protein erl- <dig> is highly similar to human erlin- <dig> and erlin-2
the c. elegans gene c42c <dig>   encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein  with strong similarity to mammalian erlin- <dig> and erlin- <dig>   <cit> . no other credible erlin homologue can be found in the c. elegans genome . alignment of the amino acid sequences between c. elegans erl- <dig> and either human erlin- <dig> or erlin- <dig> shows ~65% identity  . several important features previously identified in mammalian erlins  <cit>  are also present in the c. elegans protein, including the n-terminal transmembrane domain, the spfh domain and the n-glycosylation site. in addition, a phenylalanine residue required for high molecular weight  complex formation of human erlins   <cit> , is conserved in c. elegans erl- <dig> .

to confirm that erl- <dig> forms complexes similar to its human counterparts, we performed sucrose gradient centrifugation on extracts of hek <dig> cells transiently transfected with an ha-tagged version of erl- <dig> cdna. as previously found for human erlin proteins  <cit> , wild type erl-1ha became enriched in higher mw fractions with a peak concentration in fraction  <dig> . substitution of f <dig> with alanine  shifted erl- <dig> into lower mw fractions, demonstrating that this residue is necessary for high mw complex formation of erl- <dig> .

to determine if c. elegans erl- <dig> localizes to the er, as do mammalian erlin proteins, we performed immunofluorescent staining of ha-tagged erl- <dig> ectopically expressed in hela cells. antibody staining of erl-1ha revealed a cytoplasmic and perinuclear pattern that co-localized with the er chaperone calnexin , indicating that c. elegans erl- <dig> localizes to the er and occupies the same subcellular compartments as mammalian erlin proteins.

overall, c. elegans and human erlin proteins appear to be highly similar with respect to amino acid sequence, biochemical properties and subcellular location. it is thus reasonable to expect that erlin protein function is also conserved between the two species.

erl- <dig> is widespread in the embryo, but is primarily expressed in the gonad in adult worms
to determine the expression pattern of erl- <dig>  we first attempted to use transcriptional gfp reporter constructs but this approach is complicated by the fact that erl- <dig> is part of an operon. however, a fraction of erl- <dig> transcripts contain sl <dig> trans-splice leaders, suggesting the possibility of operon-independent transcription  <cit> . three different gfp reporter constructs were generated by cloning upstream regions of erl- <dig>  5' of a gfp transgene . however, none of these potential erl- <dig> promotor regions induced detectable gfp expression in transgenic worms .

antibodies were raised against the c-terminal half of the erl- <dig> protein and used for western blot analysis to identify developmental stages at which erl- <dig> protein was expressed. erl- <dig> could be detected throughout worm development, with highest expression levels  in embryos and l <dig> larvae . next we performed immunofluorescent staining of erl- <dig> at various developmental stages. erl- <dig> could be detected in the cytoplasm of all cells of early embryos . in adult worms, erl- <dig> staining was primarily observed in the gonad. figure 4c shows staining of dissected adult gonads and intestines: staining with erl- <dig> antibody revealed that erl- <dig> protein is expressed throughout the gonad but appears absent from the intestine, i.e. erl- <dig> staining did not exceed the background levels observed with the erl- <dig> null mutant animals described below.

our finding that erl- <dig> is primarily expressed in the gonad of adult worms is consistent with previously published serial analyses of gene expression  data. sage studies have detected erl- <dig> transcripts in dissected gonads  <cit>  and purified oocytes  <cit>  but neither in glp- <dig> animals  nor in isolated glp- <dig> intestines  <cit> . silencing of transgenes in the c. elegans germline  <cit>  could explain why erl- <dig> gene expression could not be detected using transcriptional reporter constructs.

erl- <dig> deficiency does not cause an obvious phenotype
to explore the in vivo function of erl- <dig> in c. elegans, we utilized a strain homozygous for the allele tm <dig>  a  <dig> bp deletion within the erl- <dig> gene that removes exons  <dig> and  <dig> and part of exon  <dig> . the tm <dig> allele is predicted to cause a frame shift leading to a premature stop codon. the resulting n-terminal  <dig> amino acid truncation product is unlikely to be functional, even if it were to be expressed.

we used genomic pcr with two different primer sets to confirm the presence of this deletion in a strain homozygous for erl- <dig> . rt-pcr and cdna sequencing showed that the transcripts produced from wild type and mutant erl- <dig> genes contained the predicted sequences . the absence of erl- <dig> protein expression in erl- <dig> mutants was demonstrated by western blotting using an erl- <dig> specific antibody. the erl- <dig> antibody detected a band of ~ <dig> kda in wild type lysates that was completely absent in erl- <dig> lysates, consistent with tm <dig> being an erl- <dig> null allele

the role of erl- <dig> in c. elegans has not been previously characterized. we therefore examined the overall phenotype of a strain homozygous for erl- <dig> . there was no measureable difference in growth rate at 20°c , in general morphology , and in life span  between erl- <dig> and wild type worms. even when worms were grown under heat stress conditions at 26°c, erl- <dig> had no effect on growth rate . thus lack of erl- <dig> has either no effect or a very minor effect on overall viability and phenotype of c. elegans.

erl- <dig> is not a major modulator of itr- <dig> dependent processes
mammalian erlins have been shown to be required for erad of activated ip <dig> receptors, and have therefore been proposed to negatively regulate ip <dig> signaling  <cit> . to test this proposal, we examined the effect of erl- <dig> deficiency on three different ip3r-dependent processes in c. elegans.

 brood size
signaling through the c. elegans ip <dig> receptor itr- <dig> is required for ovulation as it controls gonadal sheath cell contractions and spermathecal dilations  <cit> . both increases and decreases in itr- <dig> activity reduce brood size, albeit to a different extent  <cit> . for example, the weak itr- <dig> loss-of-function  allele sa <dig> reduces brood size by ~75%, while the itr- <dig> gain-of-function  allele sy <dig> reduces brood size by only ~25%   <cit> . we examined the effect of erl- <dig> deficiency in both wild type and sensitized itr- <dig> mutant backgrounds. if erl- <dig> were to be involved in erad of itr- <dig>  loss of erl- <dig> should lead to increased itr- <dig> levels and increased ip3r signaling: the overall effect would be that an itr- <dig> gof phenotype should be enhanced and an itr- <dig> lof phenotype should be suppressed. we found that erl- <dig> slightly decreased brood size in a wild type background :  <dig>  ± 23; n =  <dig> vs. wild type:  <dig> ± 38; n = 19; p-value <  <dig> ) as well as in unc- <dig> control worms  erl- <dig>  <dig> ± 29; n =  <dig> vs. unc- <dig>  <dig> ± 19; n = 20; p-value <  <dig> ) . however, it would be difficult to ascribe this minor phenotype to the loss of erlin function, as opposed to a tightly linked but unrelated mutation not removed by outcrossing. more convincing is the finding that erl- <dig> had no effect on brood size in itr- <dig> unc- <dig>  double mutants or itr- <dig> mutants . thus, lack of erl- <dig> has either no effect or has a very minor effect on the brood size in wild type animals and itr- <dig> mutants.

 embryogenesis
itr- <dig> also regulates epidermal cell migration, which is crucial during embryonic development. the weak itr- <dig> lof allele sa <dig> increases rates of embryonic arrest by interfering with epidermal cell migration  <cit> . on average 2% of wild type embryos and 6% of itr- <dig> embryos do not develop past the embryonic stage . if erl- <dig> negatively regulated itr- <dig> activity, erl- <dig> would be expected to decrease embryonic arrest in itr- <dig> mutants. however, erl- <dig> did not significantly alter rates of embryonic arrest either in wild type animals or in itr- <dig> mutants . thus, despite its widespread presence in c. elegans embryos, erl- <dig> is not essential for embryonic development and does not measurably affect itr- <dig> signaling during this process.

 defecation rate
a particularly well studied function of itr- <dig> is to control defecation rates. while itr- <dig> lof leads to increased defecation cycle lengths, itr- <dig> gof slightly decreases the length of the cycle  <cit> . itr- <dig> functions in intestinal cells to control defecation rates  <cit>  but since erl- <dig> levels in the intestine are below detection limits , it is unlikely that erl- <dig> would affect this rhythmic behaviour by acting on itr- <dig>  indeed, we did not observe any significant effect of erl- <dig> on defecation rates in wild type, unc- <dig> or itr- <dig> mutant strains .

in summary, we investigated the effect of erl- <dig> deficiency on three distinct ip3r-dependent processes but could find no evidence for a role of erl- <dig> in negatively regulating ip3r activity.

lack of erl- <dig> does not affect response to er stress
in addition to targeting ip3rs for erad, mammalian erlins have been shown to play a role in targeting certain other proteins for degradation by the erad pathway  <cit> . it is therefore possible that c. elegans erl- <dig> might function in erad of a broad range of substrates beyond itr- <dig> and indeed, erl- <dig> might be involved in a more general clearance of unfolded proteins from the er. c. elegans strains with mutations in erad show decreased survival and delayed development in the presence of er stress inducing agents, like tunicamycin  or dithiothreitol   <cit> . to examine the effect of erl- <dig> deficiency on tn sensitivity, we plated wild type and erl- <dig> embryos onto ngm plates containing different concentrations of tn. after  <dig> hrs, worms were scored by dividing them into three categories:  dead,  younger than l <dig>  and  l <dig> and adults . we detected no difference in development and survival between wild type and erl- <dig> . we performed a similar experiment with a second er stressor, dtt, but again saw no significant difference. in more detail, wildtype and erl- <dig> embryos were laid on standard ngm plates containing either  <dig> or  <dig> mm dtt. after 72+/- <dig> hours at 20°c, worms were collected and tip-to-tail lengths measured quantitatively . the three day exposure to  <dig> mm dtt reduced the average body length by a factor of  <dig> +/-  <dig>  and  <dig> +/-  <dig>  for wildtype worms and erl- <dig> worms, respectively.

mutations disrupting the erad pathway also increase levels of er stress under basal and er stress conditions  <cit> . er stress levels can be monitored using a reporter construct, in which gfp expression is controlled by the promoter region of hsp- <dig>  <cit> . hsp- <dig> is the c. elegans homologue of the mammalian er chaperone grp78/bip and becomes transcriptionally upregulated in response to er stress  <cit> . we examined gfp expression in hsp-4::gfp worms by western blotting . erl- <dig> had no apparent effect on gfp expression either under basal conditions or following exposure to  <dig> μg/ml tn for various lengths of time. many erad proteins become upregulated in response to er stress  <cit>  but erl- <dig> protein levels were not affected by tn treatment . in summary, our data indicate that erl- <dig> does not play an essential role in the c. elegans erad pathway.

discussion
this study is the first to characterize the c. elegans erlin homologue and to explore erlin function in the context of an intact organism. we show that the c. elegans erlin homologue erl- <dig> is highly similar to human erlins, both in sequence and in biochemical behaviour. although such strong conservation across species suggests an important function for erlin proteins, lack of erl- <dig> does not produce a detectable phenotype in c. elegans. based on mammalian cell culture experiments, erlins have been implicated in erad of activated ip <dig> receptors  <cit>  and thus might negatively regulate ip3r signalling. however, based on expression pattern alone, erl- <dig> is unlikely to be a ubiquitous necessary regulator of itr- <dig>  the c. elegans homologue of ip3r.

we examined the effect of erl- <dig> deficiency on three different itr- <dig> dependent processes: embryonic development, brood size and defecation rates  <cit> . since erl- <dig> is widely expressed in the embryo, erl- <dig> could potentially regulate itr- <dig> activity during embryonic development. however, our data provide no evidence that erl- <dig> regulates embryonic development, with or without involvement of itr- <dig>  ip3r signaling affects brood size by controlling contractions of the gonadal myoepithelial sheath cells as well as dilations of the spermatheca  <cit> . immunofluorescence could not clearly establish if erl- <dig> was expressed in the gonadal sheath cells or in the spermatheca. thus, the lack of effect of erl- <dig> on brood size could either be due to lack of expression in the appropriate tissue or simply because erl- <dig> does not affect itr- <dig> activity during ovulation. similarly, defecation rates are controlled by itr- <dig> expressed in intestinal cells  <cit>  but since erl- <dig> is not expressed in the intestine, it was to be expected that we could detect no effect of erl- <dig> loss on defecation rates. overall, our results indicate that erl- <dig> cannot be either a ubiquitous or a necessary regulator of itr- <dig> dependent processes in c. elegans. redundancy with similar proteins cannot explain this lack of effect because other spfh proteins in c. elegans only share remote sequence similarity with erlins.

so, why does erlin loss in c. elegans have so few consequences compared to erlin loss in humans, which appears to cause serious disease  <cit> ? obviously, we cannot rule out subtle minor phenotypes in c. elegans nor can we rule out an unknown parallel pathway that could compensate for erlin loss. it is also possible that worms adapt to erl- <dig> loss by upregulating other proteins. however, some of the different behaviour might reflect the different time scales on which worms and mammals operate their lives. in mammalian cells, proteasomal degradation of ip3rs has only been observed after prolonged stimulation by ligands that induce a sustained increase in ip <dig> levels  <cit> . degradation of ip3r protein in response to activation usually occurs over a period of several hours with a half maximal effect at 30- <dig> mins  <cit> . erad therefore appears to represent a negative regulatory feedback mechanism in processes involving sustained activation of ip3r. such a global stimulation of ip3rs by external application of artificially high concentrations of ligands cannot be achieved in c. elegans. in contrast, we investigated physiological processes involving ip3r activation. at least two of the processes investigated in the present study, gonadal sheath cell contractions and defecation cycles, involve cyclic ip3r activation on a much shorter timescale  <cit> . these processes require rapid activation and deactivation of ip3rs, and deactivation has been shown to be at least partly mediated by enzymes that process ip <dig>  such as ip <dig> kinase and ip <dig> phosphatase  <cit> . thus, erad may not provide a sufficiently rapid mechanism for ip3r inactivation to play a role in processes such as c. elegans ovulation and defecation that occur on a time scale of minutes or even seconds.

CONCLUSIONS
erlins have been strongly implicated in erad-based turnover of ip <dig> receptors in mammalian cell cultures. we have searched for a similar function for the highly conserved erlin homolog  in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans. loss of function of the c. elegans erl- <dig> gene produces no obvious phenotype; in particular, we could find no evidence that erl- <dig> participates in several ip3r based processes, such as ovulation, embryogenesis and defecation. overall, we conclude that erl- <dig> is unlikely to be a ubiquitous and necessary regulator of ip3r function in c. elegans.
