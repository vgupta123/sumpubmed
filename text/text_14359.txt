BACKGROUND
understanding genetic control of tassel and ear architecture in maize  is important due to their relationship with grain yield. for efficient production of hybrid seed, inbreds used as males typically have a larger tassel that sheds greater amounts of pollen over a relatively long period of time, while the ears of the female inbred tend to be longer in length and have more kernel rows 
 <cit> . these important traits are under selection during breeding program and controlled by quantitative trait loci  
 <cit> . qtl mapping has successfully been employed to identify relevant loci of many crucial yield-related traits in crop plants, including seed number, seed size, and plant architecture 
 and has been shown to be a powerful strategy to identify underlying genes and elements when combined with map-based cloning 
. however, the high complexity of crop genomes and the low-coverage of genetic markers across chromosomes have posed great challenges for dissection of quantitative genetic variation by qtl analysis, especially small-effect qtl 
 <cit> .

the efficiency of qtl mapping largely depends on marker density and population size. advanced populations such as recombinant inbred lines  and nearly isogenic lines  are frequently used for qtl mapping to reduce the cost of genotyping due to the high frequency of recombination within a limited population size 
. qtl mapping resolution can be improved with larger population sizes and greater marker density to detect the locations of recombination events more precisely 
 <cit> . construction of large advanced crop populations can be both time consuming and expensive. therefore, large populations of f2s, backcrosses  such as bc1s, or other early generation crosses, combined with high through-put genotyping method provide an alternative. vales et al. <cit>  estimated the effect of population size on qtl mapping and concluded that a large early generation population was able to detect more qtl, including small-effect qtl, than studies that used smaller advanced generation populations. a huge maize-teosinte bc <dig> population of  <dig> individuals was constructed for fine mapping of qtl associated with domestication, and resulted in identification of hundreds of qtl for  <dig> traits 
 <cit> . when the marker density was increased in the region of the tb <dig> gene, the authors were able to detect additional crossovers in the open reading frame  and flanking regions, indicating the importance of both population size and marker density for qtl cloning.

recent advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have provided cost effective platforms for direct detection of high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms  markers for genotyping of mapping populations 
. the maize genome sequence and resources such as hapmap greatly assist mapping strategies based on high-throughput genotyping by the identifying genes and polymorphisms that may reside between intervening markers 
. genotyping-by-sequencing  
 <cit>  is a popular new method for affordably acquiring dense genome wide marker data for large sample size populations and has been successfully utilized for genetic studies in a variety of species 
. limitations of gbs include a relatively large proportion of missing data and a small, but rarely corrected, percentage of snp genotyping sequencing errors. recently, spindel et al. <cit>  developed a custom-designed pipeline for snp imputation, error correction, and streamlined data analysis based on low-coverage sequencing of a ril population. using imputed high-density markers, they were able to detect recombination hot and cold spots of segregation distortion with high degree of accuracy, and identify previously unreported qtl for leaf width and aluminum tolerance in rice. another option for imputing missing snp data is the sliding-window approach, where adjacent snps with same genotype in an interval are combined into bins that demarcate recombination locations across the whole population 
 <cit> . the bin-map method is demonstrated to be more powerful for detecting qtl than traditional methods and has also been employed for fine mapping of yield-associated loci in rice and sorghum and root-knot nematode resistance qtl in soybean 
.

in this study, a large f <dig> population was generated from crossing the elite chinese inbred chang7- <dig> with the ex-pvp line  <dig>  the maternal line  <dig> is characterized by the absence of lateral tassel branches, while the paternal line used, chang7- <dig>  typically has about  <dig> branches. dense marker data was obtained for  <dig> f <dig> individuals using gbs and a modified sliding-window approach, resulting in a total of  <dig>  recombination bin markers. tassel branch number, kernel row number, and ear length was measured on individual plants and used to map qtl. our results suggest this cost effective approach is capable of rapid fine mapping qtl and candidate genes in maize.

RESULTS
sequencing, genotyping, and bin-map construction
for each f <dig> individual, the reads of the 100-bps sequences were sorted based on the indices . a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads with average of  <dig>  reads per f <dig> individual were generated, which is equivalent to ~ <dig> -fold coverage of the maize genome for each f <dig> individual. the 100-mer short reads of parents and f <dig> individuals were aligned with the b <dig> refgen_v <dig> sequence to get the physical positions of each snp. a total of  <dig> , <dig> high-quality snps were identified between two parents . of these,  <dig>  snps observed with the low coverage sequencing of the f <dig> population were selected  such that each f <dig> individual had ~ <dig>  snps, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and yielding a genome-wide snp density at ∼  <dig> snp/ <dig> -kb per individual.

the recombination maps were divided into skeleton bins 
 <cit>  for further genetic analysis, then grouped into the  <dig>  bin markers as described in method . the length of bin markers ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig>  mb, with a mean of  <dig>  kb, and a median of  <dig> kb. in total,  <dig> % of bin markers were less than  <dig>  mb in length. there were  <dig> bins larger than  <dig>  mb in size and  <dig> big bins of more than  <dig>  mb dispersed on chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the number of crossovers for each individual was calculated based on the bin markers. the average number of crossovers was  <dig> , and ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> with median of  <dig> .figure  <dig>

for construction of the genetic linkage map, segregation ratios of each bin marker were calculated and  <dig> out of  <dig> bin markers were highly distorted from 1:2: <dig>  . distorted markers were considered to be related to difficulties in genotyping and deleted. the total distance of the genetic map was  <dig> .0 cm, approximately  <dig>  cm per bin, and the average distance between neighboring bin markers ranged from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm .

the quality and accuracy of the map
in order to examine the mapping power of the strategy with highly heritable traits, we recorded the color of silks  for the  <dig> individuals with an ear. the color was divided into two groups with red and green and the phenotype was mapped with the scanone function in r/qtl. only one qtl was detected, but the peak encompassed the cloned gene colored  <dig>  
 <cit>  at bin10_ <dig> with a high lod score of  <dig> .figure  <dig>

dominant r <dig> controls the pigmentation of kernels and other plant tissues, including silks, by regulating the genes of enzymes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. chang7- <dig> and  <dig> f2s had red silks while the remaining individuals and  <dig> had green silks. the ratio of red silk versus green silk was close to 3: <dig> , suggesting cos was mostly controlled by a single dominate gene. the confidence interval of the qtl spanned ~700-kb and contained three bins, but these results demonstrate the high mapping resolution of the bin-map in combination with large population size.

qtl mapping for tassel and ear architecture
based on a permutation determined lod threshold of about  <dig>  ten qtl in total were identified: seven for tassel branch number on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  one for kernel row number on chromosome  <dig>  and two qtl for ear length on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> . the qtl with the largest effect on tassel branch number were qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig>  where alleles from  <dig> decreased the number of tassel branches by  <dig>  and  <dig> , explaining  <dig> % and  <dig> % of phenotypic variation, respectively. qtbn <dig> spanned a genetic distance of about 7 cm, corresponding to a physical distance of about  <dig>  mb in b <dig> refgen_v <dig> genome, and qtbn <dig> spanned a genetic distance of about  <dig>  cm, corresponding to a physical distance of about  <dig>  mb . the location of qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig> overlapped with previously reported qtl, i.e. qtbn <dig> versus tbn <dig> w and qtbn <dig> versus tbn <dig> f and tbn <dig> w <cit> . however, mapping with this population narrowed down the intervals to  <dig>  mb and  <dig>  mb on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. qtbn <dig> explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation and mapped to a region between bin3_ <dig> and bin3_ <dig>  a physical distance of  <dig>  mb . barren stalk <dig> , which is involved in the patterning of branches and inflorescence structures in maize 
 <cit> , is located in the bin of the qtl peak . the physical interval of qtbn <dig> was the smallest one among the identified qtl at ~ <dig> kb in length ; and the phenotypic variation explained by this locus was  <dig> %. qtbn <dig> was located in a large interval of  <dig>  mb on chromosome  <dig>  and explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. both of qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig> were consistent with tbn <dig> w and tbn <dig> w in a report by briggs et al. <cit> , respectively. the remaining two previously unreported qtl  had an effect size of ~ <dig> branch, with chang7- <dig> carrying the alleles for greater branch number .table  <dig>

only one small-effect qtl for kernel row number was identified in our large f <dig> population , which explained  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation. this qtl on chromosome  <dig>  qkrn <dig>  is in the similar location as qkrow <dig>  which was detected in a small f <dig> population 
 <cit> , but our locus was mapped to a smaller physical interval of  <dig>  mb. for ear length, two qtl on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> were detected, explaining a total of  <dig> % of the phenotypic variation . austin and lee 
 <cit>  identified an ear length qtl with a large confidence interval in genetic bin  <dig> , but the qtl identified in this study was narrowed down to a  <dig>  mb region defined by bin5_ <dig> and bin5_ <dig>

the small physical intervals of qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig> encompassed only  <dig> and  <dig> protein coding genes, respectively , according to maize gene annotation database accessible at maizegdb . recent work in arabidopsis and maize have showed that mads-box tfs are possible co-factors of leafy transcriptional factor in promoting floral differentiation 
 <cit> . in addition, btb/poz domain proteins  physically recognize and target a specific subclade of class i homeobox-leucine zipper  transcription factors for proteosomal degradation 
 <cit> . these were found to be positively modulated by ra <dig> and/or kn <dig>  which are involved in floral organ development in maize 
 <cit> . among the candidate genes in the intervals of qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig>  two genes  are mads-box transcription factors and one gene  encodes a btb/poz domain protein .

discussion
advantages of the gbs based bin-map strategy
genotyping by sequencing was developed to reduce the complexity of diverse large genomes for snp discovery and genotyping of given populations. it captures the interest of geneticists and breeders because of the advantages:  no prior knowledge of genome information is required, as sequence polymorphisms are detected in the process of genotyping a population, though parental snp information is still needed for assigning genotypes  the use of  <dig> to 8-base barcode adapters allows parallel sequencing of hundreds of dna samples, dramatically reducing the time and labor required for genotyping;  methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes effectively filter repetitive sequences thus to simplify the complexity of genomes for downstream bioinformatics analysis;  the genome-wide approach of snp detection provides a dense distribution of markers across chromosomes, which is superior to traditional pcr-based markers.

unequal recovery of restriction-enzyme-cut fragments among samples combined with a high level of sample multiplexing can result in sparse marker data when conducting gbs. this problem can be solved by simply reducing the amount of sample multiplexing. however, cost is prime consideration when genotyping large populations. snp imputation using sparse data is a typical compromise that has been effectively employed. it is quite impossible to perform snp imputation based on sparse snp markers with a lot of missing data for species lacking a reference genome information, but gbs can still be utilized to generate relatively low density markers by a technique known as restriction site associated dna sequencing  and the tagged snps used for qtl analysis and genomic selection 
 <cit> . in species with a reference genome, snp imputation can be done with high accuracy in biparental mapping populations 
 <cit> . the bin-map strategy was demonstrated to be efficient in generation of ultra high-density of bin markers based on sparse snp information and identification of qtl with high resolution in rice and sorghum 
 <cit> . compared with conventional molecular marker, rflp/ssr or single snp markers, bin markers are the most informative and parsimonious set for a given population. here, we took advantage of the gbs protocol to lower cost and labor of genotyping of a large f <dig> population, generated abundant parental snp information, and utilized the maize reference genome for snp calling and imputation. in our f <dig> population, the number of crossovers for each individual was around  <dig> , indicating that about  <dig> to  <dig> recombination events occurred per chromosome. the limited recombination in f2s allows for precise imputation of missing snps within long range regions using the bin-map strategy. in total, we obtained  <dig>  high confidence bin markers. the length of bin markers ranged from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb with a mean of  <dig> -kb, suggesting that a qtl could be narrowed down to a small interval harboring dozens of genes or less.

superiority of qtl mapping in large early generation populations
genetic variations, including artificial mutagenesis and naturally occurring variation, help dissect the molecular basis of many agronomically important traits in crops. mutagenesis populations such as the ems mutagenesis population 
 <cit> , ac-ds induced population 
 <cit>  and mutator-mutagensis population 
 <cit> , have helped to isolate serials of genes controlling inflorescence development 
 <cit> . crop breeding is largely dependent on the quantitative genetic variation among germplasm. qtl mapping and genome-wide association analysis  are two dominant strategies to analyze the natural variants. however, development of a gwas population requires highly diverse germplasm and an ultra-high-density snp map to capture as many of the historical recombinant events as possible 
 <cit> , which is not so easy for every laboratory. developing, genotyping, and phenotyping advanced generation qtl mapping populations, such as rils or nils, with traditional methods is a very costly and time consuming process for crop species. qtl mapping performed with f <dig>  f2: <dig> or bc <dig> populations has been limited by population size and sparse genetic maps. mapping resolution in early generation populations using our method may be further improved by increasing population size or recombining the material for an additional mating generation. high-resolution genetic maps capture the location of every recombination event and make full use of the linkage information in the population. therefore, we generated a large f <dig> population and constructed an ultra-high-density genetic bin-map to capture as many recombinant events as possible. among the qtl we detected, the physical intervals of qtbn <dig> and qtbn <dig> were ~800-kb and  <dig>  mb, respectively , suggesting high efficiency in identification of qtl with this approach. a previous study using a large maize-teosinte bc <dig> population with  <dig> individuals identified several recombination events within gene body of the teosinte branch qtl-candidate gene tb <dig>  <cit> . we envisage that qtl mapping with large early generation populations  and high-density genetic maps may be able to narrow confidence intervals for major qtl down to single genes.

quantitative traits have complex genetic regulation and often interact with the environment. with our method, we were able to identify qtl in regions with previously reported loci for relevant traits mapped in different populations, but with a superior interval size and a single environment. in maize, tassel branch number is a component of tassel architecture involving a subset of inflorescence patterning genes, whose effects are known to be strongly influenced by the environments. briggs, et al. <cit>  showed that a few of qtl for tassel branch number detected in two different environments were overlapped  using an extremely large bc <dig> population. for flowering time, zmcct , a large-effect qtl, was detectable by that study only in one environment 
 <cit> , and identified again in a subsequent study using the derived bc2s <dig> ril population 
 <cit> . takagi et al. <cit>  proposed a fast qtl mapping method called qtl-seq using whole genome resequencing of two bulked populations that have opposite and extreme phenotypes. with this approach, the authors identified qtl and candidate genes for rice seedling vigor using an f <dig> population without replication that were able to be validated using an f <dig> rils population. although it is preferable to identify qtl with several replications in different environments, detection of qtl without replication is a reasonable alternative approach if narrow interval loci can be identified cost-effectively. furthermore, most qtl in this study overlapped with regions previously identified in other studies using different mapping populations, which provides additional confidence in the validity of the results. reduction of the qtl interval with large populations and dense marker maps for fine mapping is valuable in this context for better defining candidate genes underlying mapped loci. f2: <dig> families are often used to assess the phenotype of f <dig> individuals with replication, but qtl detected by f <dig> and f2: <dig> populations are expected to overlap. therefore, in view of quick mapping of useful qtl for complex traits, high-density markers combined with larger population size, and qtl-seq method in early-generation populations are good options for improving the traditional mapping approach. another strategy using rapid mapping to examine qtl by environment effects would be to divide the large population between environments and augment with replicated checks to adjust for the environmental effects.

accuracy of the bin-map in mapping qtl
the quality and accuracy of the bin-map for qtl detection was verified by the mapping of two known genes: r <dig>  a qualitative locus that controls the color of silk, and ba <dig>  which regulates initiation of lateral branches of the tassel.

formation of anthocyanin in maize plant tissues and kernels was intensively studied in last century. five functional genes  encoding enzymes of anthocyanin synthesis and four regulatory genes  are known to control pigmentation of plant tissues and seeds 
 <cit> . r <dig> and b are bhlh transcription factors, which involve in regulation of anthocyanin synthetic genes by cooperation with c <dig> or pl <dig>  the r2r3-myb transcription factors 
 <cit> . in this study, we detected a high lod score of  <dig> in chromosome  <dig> corresponding to r <dig> allele at bin10_ <dig>  which was located at the peak of the qtl spanning 700-kb in length, demonstrating the high accuracy of the bin-map.

tassel branching is determined by lateral meristems and many genes including lg <dig>  ba <dig>  spi <dig>  ra <dig>  ra <dig> and ra <dig> have been reported to be involved in determination of the tassel branch number 
 <cit> . ba <dig>  is a bhlh transcriptional factor that participates in initiation of all aerial lateral meristems 
 <cit> . analysis of nucleotide diversity in distinct regions of ba <dig> among inbred lines, landraces and teosintes has showed that ba <dig> was under selection during the breeding program of modern maize, indicating its historical usefulness in maize improvement 
 <cit> . our mapping results for tassel branch number identified bin3_ <dig> as the peak of qtbn <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  which harbors the ba <dig> gene and indicates the ability of the method to rapidly fine map gene regions with important contributions to the expression of complex quantitative traits.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated that use of a high-density genetic map combined with large population size and an early generation population is able to improve mapping efficiency in qtl analysis. in view of the abundance of useful naturally occurring variation in germplasm and extremely low cost of sequencing-based genotyping, we propose that qtl mapping in large early generation populations derived from bi-parental crosses is a highly efficient method for rapid identification of useful alleles. this will help to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying important traits and accelerate crop improvement in a cost-effective fashion by reducing the time required for effective genetic mapping in crops.
