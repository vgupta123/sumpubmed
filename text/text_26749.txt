BACKGROUND
bioethanol is a profitable commodity as renewable energy source. brazil is the second largest bioethanol producer of the planet, with a production of  <dig> billion liters per year. the  <dig> active brazilian distilleries use sugarcane juice and/or sugar molasses  as substrates for fermentation by sacharomyces cerevisiae  <cit> . several factors may influence the yield of the process, including  management,  low performance of the yeast,  quality of the sugarcane juice and molasses, and  microbial contamination. the bioethanol process should be developed in septic conditions during all the production period. one of the most common strategies to control microbial contamination is the cleaning of the fermentation tanks and disinfection of the yeasts. yeast cells are re-used during the six months of the harvest season  <cit> . in the end of each fermentation cycle, which takes between  <dig> and  <dig> hr, yeast cells are collected and transferred to pre-fermenter tanks where they are washed in aqueous sulfuric acid solution in order to reduce bacterial contamination. this type of treatment may cause serious metabolic stress in the yeast cells, decreasing their viability  <cit> . another alternative to control microbial contamination is the pre-treatment of the fermentation substrate  by pasteurization. it can reduce bacterial contamination to lower levels , but the high costs for cooling the substrate is not economically viable. industrial antibiotics are also frequently used by many distilleries in the pre-fermentation stage, in spite of possible environmental impacts they may cause  <cit> .

bacterial contamination appears to reduce the process productivity, by reducing yeast growth, viability, and fermentation capacity  <cit> . lactic acid bacteria  are very abundant in the bioethanol process possibly because of their tolerance to ethanol, low ph and high temperature  <cit> . lactic and acetic acids produced by lab may interfere in the yeast metabolism  <cit> . proliferation of lab in the fermentation tanks is often unpredictable, leading to shut down of the refinery for cleaning and desinfection. the proliferation of lab has indeed a negative effect in the process and may cause serious economic losses. therefore, it is crucial to have a better understanding of the abundance and diversity of lab throughout the bioethanol process in order to design more efficient production processes. to our knowledge, this is the first study in northeast brazilian distilleries aiming at the characterization of the bioethanol process microbiota. the aim of the present study was to analyze the abundance and diversity of lab in the bioethanol process. four representative distilleries  in northeast brazil were monitored between  <dig> and  <dig> 

RESULTS
the total mean number of cfus in japungu, miriri, giasa and trapiche varied between  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>   <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  and  <dig>  ×  <dig> and  <dig>  ×  <dig>  respectively . crude sugar cane juice contained  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  ×  <dig> lab cfus. juice cane lab isolates were not identified in this study. ethanol content in the process varied between  <dig>  and  <dig> %. a total of  <dig> putative lab isolates were obtained from the fermentation tanks of four distilleries . the screening of the  <dig> presumptive lab isolates by means of restriction enzyme analysis of rrna operon allowed the rapid presumptive identification of the species found in the bioethanol process. the detailed reference restriction pattern of each species  and examples of l. vini and l. fermentum patterns are presented . the typical patterns contained three diagnostic bands . most of the isolates were identified in the genus lactobacillus in the fermentation process in the four distilleries by means of their amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis  pattern. only  <dig> isolates remained as unidentified lab.

there was a higher number of lab species in the first  <dig> days of the fermentation process . lactobacillus plantarum was frequently found in the beginning of the fermentation process at miriri and japungu distilleries. l. manihotivorans was found in the beginning of the fermentation process at miriri, whereas weissella paramesenteroides was found at trapiche. overall, there was a predominance of l. fermentum and l. vini after  <dig> days of fermentation. the two species, l. fermentum and l. vini, corresponded to the majority of the isolates obtained in this study . there was a tendency of reduction of the lab species numbers towards the end of the process, suggesting the occurrence of antibiotic resistance and/or the occurrence of persistent endemic infections. the harsh conditions of the process  possibly have a selective pressure over the microbiota, leading to a selection of certain resistant lab types. l. ferintoshensis, l. diolivorans-like, l. nagelii, unidentified lab, and oenococcus kitaharae-like were also found at the end of the fermentation process. trapiche distillery showed the most distinct lab composition possibly due to the sole use of molasses. the presumptive identification based on restriction enzyme analysis of rrna was confirmed for several l. vini and l. fermentum isolates using phes and 16s rrna gene sequences . for instance, the isolates jp <dig> . <dig>  tr <dig> . <dig>  tr <dig> . <dig>  tr <dig> . <dig> had > 99% phes sequence similarity towards the l. vini. oenococcus kitaharae-like isolates and lactobacillus sp. isolates were also tentatively identified by gene sequences, confirming their status of unknown species. rep-pcr analysis using gtg <dig> primers was performed in order to evaluate the intra-specific diversity in l. fermentum and l. vini. representative isolates of the species l. fermentum from the four distilleries obtained in the same and in different sampling periods had distinct fingerprint patterns, indicating a high genomic diversity of co-occurring populations . likewise, representative l. vini isolates had different patterns . the high genomic diversity observed in l. fermentum and l. vini during the fermentation process in the four distilleries suggested the co-occurrence of several populations possibly through the introduction of new types via substrate carriage during the process. these populations are possibly adapted to tolerate ethanol. representative l. fermentum and l. vini isolates obtained in this study grew in broth containing up to 10% ethanol, reaching  <dig> cells/ml in <dig> hours of experiment in the laboratory. in the control treatments, cells grown in broth without ethanol addition reached the same densities in less than  <dig> hours.

discussion
this study demonstrates that lab is commonly found in the bioethanol process in brazilian distilleries. fermentation substrates  appear to be important sources of contamination. the bacterial abundance in substrates depends on several factors, including the origin of the cane, the time from harvesting to smashing and the rate of rain in the period  <cit> . the dominance of l. vini and l. fermentum after  <dig> days of the fermentation process indicates that these two species are highly adapted to the bioethanol process. l. fermentum may induce flocculation of yeast cells  <cit> . the species l. vini was recently classified based on a group of isolates originated from fermented grape musts  <cit> . it is related to l. nagelii and l. satsumensis. l. vini is physiologically versatile, having a facultative anaerobic homofermentative metabolism, the ability to ferment hexoses and pentoses  to lactic acid, and growth between 25°c and 45°c. the diversity of lab has been characterized in other types of fermentation processes. in the united states, the fermentation process uses corn starch or fiber hydrolysates as substrate for fermentation. in this process, l. acidophilus, l. agilis, l. amylovorus, l. brevis, l. casei, l. hilgardii, l. fermentum, l. plantarum and w. paramesenteroides are commonly found  <cit> . the bacterial diversity was also analyzed in ethanol fermentation processes in vietnam  <cit> . l. brevis, l. plantarum, pediococcus pentosaceus, weissella confusa and w. paramesenteroides were the most frequently found lab. moreover, acetic acid bacteria , amylase-producing bacteria  and some plant pathogen bacteria  were also reported. the species lactobacillus vini was observed in association with the growth of the yeast dekkera bruxellensis in a swedish bioethanol refinery  <cit> . this process passed by a period of decrease in fermentation before stabilization. the present study also found a high abundance of dekkera bruxellensis , possibly indicating an association between this yeast and lab.

effects of lab on sacharomyces cerevisiae viability were reported by the inoculation of l. fermentum and l. delbrueckii in wheat mash batch fermentation  <cit> . lactobacillus paracasei was reported to affect yeast viability when lactic acid concentration in the process exceeded  <dig> g/l  <cit> . this effect is more pronounced when in combination with acetic acid  <cit> . induction of yeast flocculation has been associated with some l. fermentum strains in synergy with the presence of calcium, which leads to loss of yeast viability  <cit> . decrease of yeast cell viability was also induced by inactivated cells of l. fermentum, suggesting that bacterial metabolites can interfere in the yeast population  <cit> . strains of l. plantarum, l. fructivorans, l. fructosus and l. buchneri were also able to induce yeast flocculation depending on the cell density  <cit> . experiments performed at laboratory scale simulating the contamination with l. fermentum showed that viability of the yeast cells, sugar consumption and ethanol yield were severely affected when acetic acid was higher than  <dig>  g/l  <cit> . in the present work observations such as the microbiota alterations throughout the process, the presence of distinct populations of l. vini and l. fermentum, and the co-ocurrence of high numbers of d. bruxellensis and l. vini indicate a complex microbial ecology in the bioethanol process. the abundance and diversity of lab observed in the four distilleries analyzed in this study also suggest that the bioethanol process can be improved through the use of  higher quality raw material , mainly fresh plants with low loads of soil and microbes,  washing of sugar cane plants with clean water,  higher quality substrates  that would contain a lower load of lab, and  strain-specific designed antimicrobial treatments targeting the most frequently found lab. often harvesting of sugar cane plants is uncoupled of the subsequent steps of the process , resulting in the partial rooting of the plants and microbial growth. the high cfu counts obtained in this study suggest that contamination is usual in the bioethanol process. the genomic variability observed in rep-pcr patterns indicates the re-inoculation of different types of l. fermentum and l. vini throughout the process possibly due to the management practices.

because industrial data of the four distilleries examined in this study suggested that lactic acid concentration in the fermentation process was high, and considering that lab was reported as a major component of the microbiota of the bioethanol process in other studies  <cit> , we used an elective general medium that allows growth of lab to isolate the highest number of this type of bacteria. it is important to notice that mrs recovered different types of lab. this medium was not selective for a given type of lab, suggesting that it recovered a wide variety of circulating lab types. although, we cannot rule out the possibility that some lab were overlooked in this study, but in any case we consider that this study gives an initial contribution to the field.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first study aiming at a broad survey of lab diversity in the bioethanol process in brazil. the results herein presented clearly illustrate that lab are an important component of the bioethanol process. improved management practices may increase the yields of the bioethanol process. this study opens up new avenues of research aiming at the control and technological use of lab. due to their ability to grow in harsh environmental conditions, these bacteria may offer new genes and pathways for technological applications. in addition, detailed taxonomic work underway will describe the new species found in the bioethanol process.
