BACKGROUND
nadph-cytochrome-p <dig> oxidoreductase  is a ubiquitous enzyme that is required for activity of the microsomal cytochrome-p <dig>  monooxygenase system  <cit> . this system is involved in the metabolic activation and/or detoxification of numerous foreign compounds as well as in the metabolism of endogenous substrates, such as steroids, alkaloids and fatty acids  <cit> . cpr belongs to a family of diflavin oxidoreductases which also includes the flavoprotein subunit of bacterial sulfite reductase  as well as a methionine synthase reductase and the cytoplasmic nadph-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase  <dig>  identified in eukaryotic cells  <cit> . in addition, the diflavin reductase domain is found in fusion with cytochromes p- <dig> or with hemoprotein forming complex multidomain enzymes such as the cytochromes p450bm <dig> and the nitric oxide synthases  <cit> .

cpr is a membrane anchored ~ <dig> kda enzyme which contains one molecule each of fad and fmn bound as prosthetic groups that facilitate transfer of electrons of nadph to the prosthetic heme group of cyp  <cit> . cpr is also involved in transferring electrons to other molecules, including heme oxygenase, squalene epoxidase and cytochrome b <dig>  <cit> .

despite the diversity of cyp isoforms that can be found in a single species  <cit> , cpr in most organisms, except in certain plants and some zygomycetes, is encoded by only one gene  <cit> . inactivation of the single-copy cpr gene in saccharomyces cerevisiae results in mutants that accumulate only 25% as much ergosterol as observed in wild-type strains which probably accounts for the increased sensitivity of these mutants to the antifungal drug ketoconazole  <cit> . moreover, it has been reported that cytochrome b <dig> gene can suppress the phenotype resulting from disruption of the cpr gene and therefore might function as an alternative electron donor for cyp activity in yeast  <cit> . in the fungus gibberella fujikuroi loss of cpr leads to a reduced growth rate and has a strong influence on gibberellin biosynthesis  <cit> .

cpr gene-disruption experiments in mouse have demonstrated that absence of this enzyme causes defects leading to mid-gestational lethality  <cit> . in situ hybridization studies have shown high levels of cpr expression in mesenchymal cells of the limbs and developing olfactory neuroepithelia  <cit> . cpr has been implicated in odorant clearance in insect antennae  <cit>  and in ecdysone 20-hydroxylation during insect embryonic development  <cit> .

annotation of the sequenced genome of d. discoideum  <cit>  revealed the presence of three genes that encode putative members of the diflavin oxidoreductase protein family. ddb <dig>  on chromosome  <dig> encodes a polypeptide of  <dig> amino acids, which is 56% similar to human nadph-dependent diflavin oxidoreductase  <dig> , a cytoplasmic enzyme highly expressed in cancer cell lines with as yet unknown functions  <cit> . two genes, reda  on chromosome  <dig> and redb  on chromosome  <dig>  show about 50% similarity to cpr proteins in humans, rats, drosophila and yeast. we found that inactivation of reda in dictyostelium results in developmental arrest at the mound stage.

RESULTS
identification of the disrupted gene in the remi mutant reda-
the mutant described in this work was isolated from a remi-mutagenic library screen for morphological mutants of dictyostelium discoideum. strain dg <dig> was picked because it forms yellow mounds that fail to make proper fruiting bodies. a portion of the disrupted gene was isolated from this strain by plasmid rescue in e. coli  <cit> . this fragment was used to screen a cdna library prepared from vegetative cells. the largest cdna insert  was sequenced and found to encode a putative protein of  <dig> amino acids with ~50% similarity to cprs from human, rat, drosophila, and yeast . the gene was designated reda as a mnemonic that it is likely to act in a redox reaction.

the d. discoideum cpr encoded by reda shows considerable conservation in the regions proposed to be involved in binding fmn, fad and nadph  <cit> . it is worth mentioning that the nadph- <dig> region pointed out in figure  <dig> contains the three residues ser- <dig>  arg- <dig> and lys- <dig>  involved in the binding of the enzyme to the 2' phosphate of nadph  <cit> . in addition, the conserved carboxi terminal motif g/k/n-r-y-x-x-d-v/t-w is present in d. discoideum cpr. it has been demonstrated that the tryptophan in this motif plays a major role in discrimination of nadph  <cit> .

analysis of the predicted reda amino acid sequence by signal p and tmhmm programs  <cit>  revealed a n-terminal hydrophobic segment of ~20â€“ <dig> amino acids  that should be sufficient for its anchorage to a membrane. despite the fact that the hydrophobic n-terminal of mammalian cprs is approximately  <dig> amino acids long  <cit> , in plants and in fungi a shorter hydrophobic n-terminal is sufficient for membrane interaction  <cit> . moreover, it has been proposed that interaction of human cpr to membranes and to cyps is likely to involve additional hydrophobic patches on cpr surface  <cit> .

southern blot analysis of d. discoideum genomic dna cleaved with a variety of restriction enzymes showed that reda is encoded by a single copy gene . comparison of reda cdna sequence with the dictyostelium genome sequence  <cit>  confirmed this result and showed that reda is an intronless gene located on chromosome  <dig>  in most organisms analyzed, such as humans, mouse, drosophila, s. cerevisiae and filamentous fungi, the cpr gene is present as a single copy and in the fruit fly two alternative splicing isoforms have been identified  <cit> . on the other hand, plants and certain fungi often have multiple copies of cpr gene  <cit> . we found two cpr genes in the dictyostelium genome, reda and redb. even though the amino acid sequences of reda and redb are 52% similar to each other, their nucleotide sequences are highly diverged and the genes appear to have evolved independently for a long time. d. discoideum genome has a third gene  that encodes an additional member of diflavin oxidoreductases family which conserves sequences defined as binding domains for fmn, fad and nadph but lacks the n-terminal hydrophobic region found in reda and redb.

expression of reda during growth and development
the expression of reda was monitored by northern blot using a reda cdna fragment as probe. as shown in figure  <dig>  a single mrna species of  <dig>  kbp was present in growing cells and decreased in abundance upon starvation of the cells on filter pads. no reda mrna could be detected late in development  in agreement with the reda expression profile determined on microarrays  <cit> . as a control, we probed for the csaa mrna encoding the cell adhesion protein gp <dig> which is highly expressed during early aggregation  <cit> . this mrna accumulated rapidly to reach peak levels by  <dig> hours and decreased after  <dig> hours of development .

in contrast, we found that redb is constitutively expressed throughout development of ax <dig> cells, while redc is expressed at detectable levels only in vegetative growing cells being repressed upon cell starvation. as a late development marker we monitored expression of ecma  <cit> , a prestalk-specific gene .

cpr mrna has distinct expression patterns during the development of several tissues and organs in mice, and this expression is not coordinated with expression of cyp genes  <cit> . the cpr gene is expressed in the early stages of embryonic development, suggesting that cpr-dependent processes may be important at this stage of the embryogenesis  <cit> . in drosophila melanogaster the cpr gene shows high levels of expression in various embryonic tissues as well as in the antenna of adults  <cit> . in parsley and arabidopsis there are two cpr genes, one of which is constitutively expressed while the other is induced by biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

phenotype of the reda minus mutants
to confirm that the reda- phenotype is due to the disruption of reda, we generated new mutant strains by homologous recombination with the original plasmid pred isolated from reda remi mutant. effective reda disruption was checked by southern blot analyses of genomic dna from blasticidin-resistant clones  and six independent knockout clones were isolated which showed the same mound-arrest phenotype. one strain  was selected for further analyses. as shown in figure 4a, when compared to wild type ax <dig> strain, the majority of cells of reda- and reda-ko mutants failed to make mature fruiting bodies after  <dig> h development on filters, and was arrested at the mound stage where they accumulated a yellow pigment . it should be pointed out that the reda-ko mutants form a few tipped aggregates in the mound population after  <dig> hours starvation . on the other hand, the original remi and the recapitulated mutants did not show any significant differences in their growth curves when compared to the wild type ax <dig> .

as expected, reda- and reda-ko mutants did not express reda mrna . despite their developmental defect, reda- cells expressed csaa during development on filter pads . moreover, redc transcriptional profile is reasonably similar in wild type ax <dig> and in reda-cells  as its transcript levels strongly decrease upon starvation. on the other hand despite being expressed throughout development both in ax <dig> and reda- cells, redb transcript accumulates at higher levels in the latter . also the peak of expression of ecma was found to be advanced by four hours in the reda- strain as compared to the wild type .

the developmental defect of reda- mutant is not rescued by mixing with ax <dig> wild type cells. as shown in figure  <dig>  mixing 10% or 20% of ax <dig> with reda- mutant did not overcome the mutant mound arrest indicating autonomy of the mutant phenotype. moreover, the mutant cells did not inhibit wild type cells from forming fruiting bodies when they were developed together in equal numbers .

as mentioned above both reda- and reda-ko mutants form yellow mounds upon starvation . we have observed that after  <dig> hours filter starvation the mounds and even the filter turn a strong yellow colour. this does not reflect premature spore formation since the yellow mounds do not contain any viable spores . chloroform extracts of reda- mounds collected after  <dig> hours starvation show an absorption peak at  <dig> nm which is not observed in ax <dig> cells . we did not succeed in characterizing the metabolites that accumulate in reda-mutants despite many attempts.

cpr is a key enzyme in many metabolic processes, as a consequence of its close interactions with cytochrome p <dig> heme oxygenases. in particular, its participation in synthesis and/or degradation of important cellular compounds, such as retinoic acid, cholesterol and steroid hormones  <cit>  may be related to abnormalities observed in development of organisms where cpr expression is abolished  <cit> . development of homozygous mouse embryos carrying inactivating mutations in both alleles of the cpr gene is severely impaired, but lethality is only observed  <dig> to  <dig> days after zygote formation  <cit> . these findings indicate the importance of cpr in early animal development. our results point to a role for a d. discoideum cpr in the metabolism of factors which control its cellular differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
the d. discoideum genome encodes three genes  for enzymes of diflavin oxidoreductases family. disruption of reda led to mutant cells that form yellow mounds that fail to make proper fruiting bodies. the developmental arrest shown by this mutant implicates reda-encoded p <dig> oxidoreductase in the metabolism of compounds that control cell differentiation.
