BACKGROUND
during development the expression of human β-like globin genes displays two switches: the embryonic  to fetal  globin switch, coinciding with the transition from embryonic  to definitive  haematopoiesis, and the fetal to adult  globin switch, occurring near the parturient period with the establishment of bone marrow as the main site of hematopoiesis  <cit> . it has been shown that fetal hemoglobin  expression can be reactivated during adult erythropoiesis  <cit> . the increased production of fetal hemoglobin could ameliorate the clinical severity of sickle cell anemia  and β-thalassemia  <cit> . therefore, attempts are underway to screen for pharmaceuticals that reactivate γ-globin production in adults. hydroxyurea and sodium butyrate derivatives have been already been examined and used for treatment of β-hemoglobinopathies  <cit> . while these therapies are effective for treating scd and β-thalassemia, they also have adverse effects such as suppression of cell growth and bad effects in long-term treatment  <cit> .

an alternative treatment strategy is to increase γ-globin expression by controlling potential transcription factors that specifically activate γ-globin expression in the fetus or result in γ-globin gene silencing in the adult. to identify genes encoding such factors, we analyzed differential expression of mrna in erythroid induction cultures of cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from normal adult bone marrow  and umbilical cord blood . one of the differentially expressed genes was further examined for effects on globin gene expression.

expression levels of the ctd small phosphatase like  <dig>  gene were higher in ucb than in healthy adult bm. ctd phosphatase dephosphorylates the ctd tail of the largest subnit of rna polymerase ii . in vivo, the c-terminal domain  of the largest subunit of rna polymerase ii is either phosphorylated or dephosphorylated. dynamic, site-specific phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of the ctd occurs during the transcription cycle  <cit> . recent observations indicate that ctd phosphorylation plays a major role in orchestrating interaction of the ctd with mrna processing factors involved in capping, splicing and polyadenylation. several kinases modify the ctd phosphorylation state. however, only a few mammalian ctd phosphatases have been identified. fcp <dig>  the first characterized ctd phosphatase, contains a brct domain required for rnapii interaction and ctd dephosphorylation  <cit> . scp <dig> and ublcp <dig> contain phosphatase domains similar to fcp <dig>  and also dephosphorylate ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> of phosphorylated ctd in vitro  <cit> . the ctdspl <dig> gene product contains a ctd phosphatase catalytic domain  and the gene is 47% homologous to fcp <dig>  the function of this gene is not known although it has been shown to dephosphorylate phophoserine- <dig> and phosphoserine- <dig> within gst-ctdo in vitro  <cit> .

in this study, we show that overexpression of ctdspl <dig> significantly increased the ε- and γ- globin gene expression in k <dig> cells and cd34+ cells derived from ucb while have faint effect on ζ-, α- and β-globin gene.

RESULTS
expression pattern of ctdspl <dig> in bm and ucb and during erythroid differentiation
we analyzed differential expression of genes in cd34+ erythroid induction cell cultures derived from normal adult bm and ucb by differential display reverse transcription pcr . ctdspl <dig> had higher expression levels in erythroid cultures derived from ucb than from healthy adult bm. differential expression of ctdspl <dig> was also detected by real-time pcr. expression levels of ctdspl <dig> mrna in ucb erythroid cultures were  <dig>  times greater than in healthy adult bm erythroid cultures .

the level of ctdspl <dig> mrna during epo-induced erythroid differentiation in ucb-derived cd34+ hpcs was measured by real-time pcr. ctdspl <dig> mrna levels increased during erythroid differentiation . the mrna expression of ctdspl <dig> in hemin- and butyrate-induced k <dig> cells was measured by northern blot analysis . ctdspl <dig> mrna levels were also measured by real-time pcr at different time points during hemin-induction of k <dig> cells . levels of ctdspl <dig> mrna increased in hemin- and butyrate-induced k <dig> cells. ctdspl2's increase was more evident during hemin-induced k <dig> cell differentiation.

overexpression of ctdspl <dig> increases hemoglobin-containing cells during erythroid differentiation of k <dig> cells
we collected five stable pools of k <dig> cells transfected with pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> . real-time pcr analysis revealed that transcription of the ctdspl <dig> gene in these five transfectant pools was on average  <dig> times greater than in the k562/pc <dig>  transfectant pools and in un-transfected k <dig> cells . the western blot analysis also revealed an obvious increase of ctdspl <dig> protein in the k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectant pools .

erythroid differentiation was induced in stable k <dig> transfectants and un-transfected k <dig> cells by hemin. the cells were collected and analyzed by benzidine staining  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> h after hemin induction . among the five pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectant pools, there were four  with especially high benzidine-positive cell levels. before erythroid differentiation, 17-22% of the cells were benzidine-positive, which is equivalent to that in control cells  <dig> h after being induced by hemin. for these four transfectant pools, benzidine-positive cells were 75-80% at  <dig> h after hemin induction, significantly greater than for control cells. the percentage of benzidine-positive cells in the transfectant pool b was also higher than control cells during erythroid differentiation.

overexpression of ctdspl <dig> increases ε- and γ- globin gene expression in k <dig> cells
the transcription of a number of globin genes  was analyzed by real-time pcr in the k <dig> transfectants. overexpression of the ctdspl <dig> gene significantly increased transcription of ε- and γ-globin genes in k <dig> cells but had little effect on α-, ζ- and β-globin gene transcription. transcription of ε- and γ-globin genes in the stable k <dig> pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectant pools was  <dig> and  <dig> times greater respectively than k562/pc <dig>  transfectant pools and untransfected k <dig> cells . the improvement on α-, ζ- and β-globin gene expression was weak relative to the effects on ε- and γ-globin genes.

erythroid differentiation in the transfected cells was induced by hemin. cells were collected  <dig> h after hemin induction. overexpression of ctdspl <dig> increased expression of ε- and γ-globin genes after erythroid differentiation of k <dig> cells . the expression of ε- and γ-globin gene was  <dig> and  <dig>  times greater respectively in the k <dig> transfectants overexpressing ctdspl <dig> than in k562/pc <dig>  control cells and k <dig> cells after erythroid differentiation. the effects of ctdspl <dig> overexpression on globin gene transcription were less before erythroid differentiation than after differentiation.

transcription of α-, ε-, γ- and β-globin genes in the transfected k <dig> cells before and after erythroid differentiation was also analyzed by rnase protective assay. before hemin induction , ε-globin mrna levels in the stable k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectants were significantly higher than in control cells. γ-globin mrna levels in k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectants were also greater relative to control cells which have high γ-globin mrna levels. α-globin mrna in k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectants was greater than in control cells but α-globin mrna was still at a low level. β-globin mrna was undetected in all samples.

after hemin induction, transcription of all globin genes excluding β-globin increased in all cells . levels of ε- and γ-globin mrna in the stable k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectants was higher than in control cells. transcription of the α-globin gene in the stable k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectants was also higher than in the control cells but the α-globin mrna was still at a low level. β-globin mrna was still undetected after erythroid differentiation.

repression of ctdspl <dig> gene decreases the number of hemoglobin-containing k <dig> cells
recombinant rnai plasmids  and the psilencer <dig> -u6-neo control vector were co-transfected into hela cells with the ctdspl2-gfp fusion expression plasmid. ctdspl2-gfp expression was observed to confirm ctdspl <dig> repression in the cells. expression of ctdspl2-gfp was strongly repressed in hela cells transfected with rnaia and rnaib compared to cells transfected with psilencer <dig> -u6-neo . both the intensity of green fluorescence in each cell and the number of cells that express green fluorescent protein decreased. rnaib transfection resulted in greater repression of fluorescence. these results indicate that these two rnai plasmids repress expression of ctdspl2-gfp effectively. as the repression efficiency of rnaib was much greater, rnaib  was used in further experiments.

rnaib was subcloned into the plvthm vector and high titer lentiviruses were acquired. by lentivirus infection, we got stable k562/ctdspl2rnai transfectant pool. ctdspl <dig> mrna level measured by real-time pcr in the stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectant pool was 40% of that in the control cells . an increased ctdspl <dig> mrna level in the stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectant pool was detected after hemin induction  <dig> h but it was only 55% of that in the hemin-induced control cells.

erythroid differentiation was induced in stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectant pool and control cells by hemin and the cells were collected and analyzed by benzidine staining at different time points after hemin induction . benzidine-positive cell percentages in stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectant pool were lower than in control cells at the early erythroid differentiation stage. however, this phenomenon disappeared after hemin induction  <dig> h. the phenomena suggested that the repression of ctdspl <dig> gene in k <dig> cells could decrease the hemoglobin-containing cells but could not inhibit the increase of hemoglobin-containing cells during hemin-induced k <dig> cells erythroid differentiation.

repression of ctdspl <dig> gene in k <dig> cells can decrease the expression of ε- and γ-globin gene
the transcription of α-, ζ-, ε-, γ- and β-globin genes in the stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectants and control cells were analyzed by real-time pcr before and after erythroid differentiation. before hemin induction, ε- and γ-globin transcription in the k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectants was much less than that in control cells . ε-globin gene transcription was only 25% of that in control cells while γ- globin transcription was 41% of that in control cells. β-, ζ- and β-globin gene transcription was also less than that in control cells but the difference was not significant.  <dig> h after hemin induction, no significant difference of any globin gene transcription was found between the stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectants and control cells .

ctdspl <dig> overexpression increases ε- and γ- globin gene expression in cd34+ hpcs derived from ucb
two high titer lentiviruses that carry pwpxl-ctdspl <dig> and plvthm-ctdspl <dig> rnai were obtained. cd34+ hpcs from normal ucb were purified and were infected with the two recombinant lentiviruses respectively. the transduction efficiency of the cd34+ cells was about 70-80% through observing gfp expression. ctdspl <dig> mrna was detected by real-time pcr. ctdspl <dig> mrna levels in cd34+ cells infected by lentiviruses carrying pwpxl-ctdspl <dig> were  <dig>  times greater than that in control cells . ctdspl <dig> mrna levels in cd34+ cells infected by lentiviruses carrying plvthm-ctdspl <dig> rnai were 55% of that in control cells .

globin mrna levels in the lentivirus-infected cd34+ cells were analyzed by real-time pcr before and after epo-induced erythroid differentiation. there were mainly the α- and γ-globin gene expression in ucb derived cd34+ cells . α- and γ-globin mrna levels were  <dig> times greater after epo-induced erythroid differentiation .

overexpression of ctdspl <dig> gene in cd34+ hpcs increased transcription of all globin genes . ε-globin mrna in cd34+ hpcs overexpressing ctdspl <dig> was  <dig>  times greater than in control cells. repression of the ctdspl <dig> gene in cd34+ hpcs decreased transcription of the ε-globin gene but had little effect on other globin genes. ε-globin gene expression in cd34+ hpcs with repressed ctdspl <dig> was only 22% of that in control cells.

transcription of a number of globin genes in the lentivirus-infected cd34+ cells was measured  <dig> days after induction by epo . increases in ε-globin gene transcription in epo-induced cd34+ cells were much stronger than in un-induced cd34+ cells. ε-globin gene transcription in cd34+ hpcs overexpressing ctdspl <dig> was  <dig>  times greater than in control cells. overexpression of the ctdspl <dig> gene also increased α- and γ-globin gene transcription in epo-induced cd34+ cells. decreases of globin gene transcription in cd34+ cells with repressed ctdspl <dig> were no longer observed after erythroid differentiation.

discussion
by differential display analysis, we found that the transcription of the ctdspl <dig> gene in ucb erythroid cultures was greater than in adult bm erythroid cultures. meanwhile, γ-globin gene developmentally expressed mainly in ucb and little in adult bm  <cit> . furthermore, we measured transcription levels of ctdspl <dig> during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation of k <dig> cells and epo-induced erythroid differentiation of cd34+ hpcs and found that its expression increased significantly during erythroid differentiation. γ-globin gene transcription also increased significantly during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation in k <dig> cells and epo-induced erythroid differentiation in cd34+ hpcs  <cit> . based on this evidence, we hypothesized that ctdspl <dig> plays a role in γ-globin gene activation.

ctd phosphatases can dephosphorylate the ctd tail of the largest subnit of rnapii and play a major role in mrna processing. only a few mammalian ctd phosphatases have been identified  <cit> . ctd small phosphatase like  <dig>  contains a ctd phosphatase catalytic domain  and dephosphorylates phophoserine- <dig> and phosphoserine- <dig> within gst-ctdo in vitro  <cit> .

the k <dig> cell line was chosen for this study as it is commonly used to study globin gene regulation  <cit> . we prepared five stable k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectant pools. benzidine staining showed that overexpression of the ctdspl <dig> gene increased the number of hemoglobin-containing cells during k <dig> erythroid differentiation. to determine which globin genes are affected, a number of globin genes  were analyzed. the results showed that overexpression of ctdspl <dig> increased the transcription of ε- and γ-globin genes in k <dig> cells before and after erythroid differentiation, while there was only a small effect on the α-, ζ- and β-globin genes. of course, the random integration into genome and the incomplete simulation of endogenous gene in overexpression study may arise some trustless results. but the use of several stable transfectant pools in this study may partially overcome this disadvantage.

ctdspl <dig> may be specifically recruited into the transcriptional initiation complex at the ε- and γ-globin gene promoters through interaction with ε- and γ-globin specific transcription factors. in order to identify candidate transcription factors, ctdspl2-interacting proteins will need to be determined. expression of the erythroid surface marker, cd <dig>  increased to some degree in the stable k562/pc <dig> -ctdspl <dig> transfectant pools . so, it is also possible that ctdspl <dig> increased ε- and γ-globin gene expression by increasing erythroid differentiation of k <dig> cells partially.

to determine if ctdspl <dig> is necessary for ε- and γ-globin gene expression, we examined the effect of ctdspl <dig> repression by rnai on globin gene expression in k <dig> cells. repression of the ctdspl <dig> gene decreased the transcription of the globin genes, especially the ε-globin gene. however, repression of ctdspl <dig> did not inhibit the increase of globin gene expression during hemin-induced erythroid differentiation. therefore, ctdspl <dig> can increase ε- and γ-globin gene expression but it is not indispensable for increases of ε- and γ-globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation. there may be other genes that can compensate for ctdspl <dig> in the activation of globin gene expression. alternatively, ctdspl <dig> level is decreased but not eliminated in our experiments. transcription of ctdspl <dig> in stable k562/ctdspl <dig> rnai transfectants still increased during erythroid differentiation. this may explain why repression of ctdspl <dig> could not inhibit the increase of globin gene expression during erythroid differentiation.

the effects of ctdspl <dig> on globin gene expression in cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were also examined. cd34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells were quiescent and generally non-dividing. lentiviruses can effectively infect quiescent, non-divisive cells and are widely used in hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy  <cit> . we achieved overexpression and repression of the ctdspl <dig> gene in cd34+ cells by lentivirus infection. the effects in lentivirus-infected cd34+ cells were consistent with those in transfected k <dig> cells. ctdspl <dig> overexpression significantly increased ε-globin gene expression and also increased γ-globin gene transcription. the greater effect of ctdspl <dig> on ε-globin gene transcription than γ-globin gene transcription may be partly due to the high baseline level of γ-globin gene transcription in k <dig> cells and ucb-derived cd34+ hpcs. in future studies, the effect of ctdspl <dig> on γ-globin gene transcription will be measured in bone marrow-derived cd34+ hpcs in which there is little γ-globin gene expression.

the expression of ctdspl <dig> increased significantly during erythroid differentiation. this suggested that its expression may be regulated by erythroid differentiation-related factors. the analysis of its promoter and mechanism of its specific expression is necessary. the overexpression of ctdspl <dig> can specifically increase epsilon and gamma globin spontaneous expression, but ctdspl <dig> does not contain a dna binding domain. so it is impossible for ctdspl <dig> to bind to epsilon and gamma-globin gene promoter directly. and it is possible that it was recruited to epsilon and gamma-globin gene promoter by interacting with some important globin related transcriptional factors such as eklf, fklf, nf-e <dig>  etc. so to find the possible ctdspl <dig> interacting protein through immunoprecipitation or two hybrid system in mammalian cell is the next step. in addition to identify the existence of ctdspl <dig> in epsilon and gamma globin gene promoter complex through chromatin immunoprecipitation is also necessary. on the other hand, it is possible that ctdspl <dig> regulate the phosphorylation status of the key factors in globin gene expression. it is reported that scp <dig> can dephosphorylate ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> of phosphorylated rna polii ctd in vitro as fcp <dig>   <cit> . it is also reported that scp1- <dig> can dephosphorylate smad <dig> c-terminal tail, thereby attenuating bmp signaling  <cit> . it also can dephosphorylate the linker regions of smad <dig> and smad2/ <dig> in vitro <cit> . so the substrate of ctdspl <dig> may be various not limited to the ctd tail of rna polii.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion this study showed that ctdspl <dig> increases ε- and γ-globin gene expression in k <dig> cells and ucb-derived cd34+ hpcs. reactivation of the γ-globin gene in the adult has been demonstrated to be significant for treatment of scd and β-thalassemia. the reactivation of the ε-globin gene should also have similar effects. thus our study provides a new candidate target for effective treatment of scd and β-thalassemia through activation of ε- and γ-globin genes in adults. further investigation of the mechanism of ctd phosphatase in globin gene regulation may open new ways to regulate gene transcription with ctd phosphatases.
