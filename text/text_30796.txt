BACKGROUND
anaplasma phagocytophilum  is a common tick borne obligate intracellular pathogen with an uncommon tropism for host granulocytes. while much has been made of the physiologic stability of the intracellular environment, vector transmission requires extraordinary flexibility to bind and infect the variety of cell types encountered in the travels of the pathogen within and between vector and host. remarkably, ap and the related rickettsial pathogens accomplish this feat with small genomes.

tracking tissue distribution, cellular binding, entry, and intracellular development of these organisms would be greatly augmented by expression of fluorescent proteins, but genetic transformation of obligate intracellular bacteria has only been accomplished in a few cases  <cit> . obstacles to transformation of obligate intracellular pathogens include: dna delivery while retaining viability of extracellular bacteria, efficient reintroduction of the transformed bacterial population into host cells, selection , and the limited efficiency of homologous recombination and transposition systems. recent development of the mariner transposase himar <dig>  which can function in many organisms  <cit>  has effectively diminished this last obstacle. the further development of hyperactive himar <dig> mutants, as detailed by lampe et.al.  <cit> , has made this transposition system capable of driving insertional mutagenesis systems  <cit> .

here we describe the first successful transformation of anaplasma phagocytophilum. we used himar <dig> transposition to produce ap transformants that express green fluorescent reporter protein gfpuv at levels useful for imaging. these gfpuv expressing ap  transformants grow readily in a variety of cell types and in a manner so far indistinguishable from the growth of the non-transformed parental strain. also like the parental strain, they are infectious for laboratory mice.

RESULTS
southern blot, confirmation pcr and rescue cloning
to detect the presence of the gfpuv – specr dna in the fluorescent bacteria, a set of pcr primers not used in the plasmid construction  was used to amplify a  <dig> bp product which spans the junction between the two coding sequences. using total dna isolated from gfp/ap infected hl- <dig> as the template, the primers readily detected the presence of the inserted dna in  <dig> cycles. samples without primers or without template gave no signal .

transposon insertion points map to the following positions on the ap hz genome <cit> :  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> . two examples were found in which one end of the transposon maps to a different location than the other end;  <dig> or  <dig>  and  <dig> or  <dig> . we attribute this to possible recombination following transposition or differences between the hge <dig> and hz ap strains. another insertion maps to a repeat region of a virb <dig> family member gene and could either be inserted at  <dig> or  <dig>  limited sequence data prevents discrimination between the two.

southern analysis of restriction digested genomic gfp/ap dna using a gfpuv probe detected 7– <dig> bands of varying intensities in most of the digests . the pattern of bands in the bglii digest and their intensities is consistent with the sizes and numbers of bglii fragments obtained in the rescue cloning from genomic dna isolated from gfp/ap. the bands detected from the bglii digest are approximately  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> kb in size. the numbers of rescue clones from each size class are  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clone,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clones,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clones,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clone,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clones,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clones,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clones,  <dig>  kb –  <dig> clone. the southern blot shows the  <dig>  kb band to be the most intense, and most rescue clones recovered were of this class. insertion events for each bglii fragment size class were sequenced out from both ends of the transposon into flanking genomic dna, and into genomic dna from the vector used in the rescue cloning. all insertions had the expected ta dinucleotides at the junctions of transposon repeats and genomic dna sequence. for sequence comparison, we used the recently sequenced ap hz strain to map the sequences obtained from the rescued clones onto the ap genome.

the transformation efficiency at this point is three to thirty transformants per electroporation of bacteria isolated from one t- <dig> flask of infected hl- <dig> cells.

in vitro growth and imaging
approximately  <dig> of gfp/ap infected hl- <dig>  were inoculated into mcherry/rf6a, mcherry/hmec- <dig>  and dsred/ise <dig> growing in  <dig> mm glass bottom culture dishes  and incubated as detailed above. after  <dig> hours, endothelial cells were rinsed to remove hl- <dig> cells and imaged. imaging revealed fully developed morulae with a variety of fluorescence intensities and characteristic, pleomorphic ap morphology . the visualization of live endothelial and hl- <dig> cell cultures revealed morulae with dramatically symmetrical arrangements of bacteria. dsred2/ise <dig> cells imaged after  <dig> days showed bacterial inclusions as characteristically indistinct masses. 

infection of mice
three mice – one c3h scid and two immunocompetent  – challenged with gfp/ap, became infected. following ip inoculation with gfp/ap infected hl- <dig>  a characteristic ap inclusion was seen in a neutrophil of the c3h scid mouse, and gfp/ap was cultured from the peripheral blood of all three mice.

discussion
transformation of ap represents an important step in the development of methods for the genetic manipulation of human and animal anaplasmosis agents. the inability to employ many molecular techniques in the study of these emerging infectious agents has hampered the normally rapid progression of research. the availability of hyperactive himar <dig> transposases and the methods described herein should allow the routine transformation of ap and related organisms and accelerate work in this area.

successful bacterial transformations require a mechanism of genomic remodeling with a high enough efficiency to be effective with a reasonable population of bacteria and a means to select rare transformants. transformation of a pathogen should not involve the use of clinically relevant antibiotics or constructs that are likely to allow horizontal transfer of resistance to other organisms. spectinomycin resistance and the himar <dig> transposon system fulfill both of these requirements. the major use of spectinomycin is presently one of  <dig> antimicrobial drugs used for treatment of gonococcal infections  <cit> . we could find no reports of spectinomycin use in anaplasmosis. ap contains no known plasmids or mobile elements that might enable resistance transfer. the "cut and paste" mechanism of mariner type transposase plasmid systems such as himar <dig>  in which the transposase sequence is not incorporated into the target genome, are not conducive to horizontal transfer. the two-plasmid system employed in these transformations may provide an additional element of safety by reducing the likelihood of accidental genomic transposase integrations.

our choice of a promoter to control expression of the transposase and gfp was driven by the analysis of the tr promoter using quantitative pcr  <cit> . the tr promoter is one of the few characterized in anaplasma and we have demonstrated it to be expressed in bacteria grown in both mammalian and tick cells. the upstream out-of-frame start codon located between the start of transcription and the start of translation was removed to increase expression of gfp and spectinomycin resistance. presumably it is present in wild type am to attenuate the level of tr protein produced. the efficiency of himar <dig> transposition is a function of transposon size, with a 38% decrease for every 1-kb increase in transposon size  <cit> . to keep the transposon under  <dig> kb the gfpuv reporter and spectinomycin resistance genes were driven by a single tr promoter via translational coupling. future studies should allow the exploration of promoters that are regulated by environmental changes.

insertion site cloning and sequencing reveals that the transposon was inserted in intergenic regions four times and interrupted real or putative coding sequences four times. the transposition event at position  <dig> is located  <dig> base pairs upstream of the stop codon of an ankyrin repeat protein gene . as a result the last  <dig> amino acids have been changed from wild type but the protein is otherwise unaffected. the transposition event at position  <dig> lies inside two small overlapping putative open reading frames . the transposition event at position  <dig> disrupts a putative open reading frame . lastly, the transposition event at position  <dig> or  <dig> lies in  a virb <dig> family member. all four of these insertions into putative coding sequences appear to be tolerated in ap cultured in hl- <dig> cells.

regarding the stability of transformants; the bacteria remain fluorescent green and spectinomycin resistant after more than  <dig> passages in hl- <dig> cells . they are a population of transformants at this point  so we expect the proportion of individual insertions relative to one another may change over time.

the development of reporter genes such as green fluorescent protein has greatly accelerated the study of changing biological systems, both in vitro and in vivo. ap that constitutively express gfpuv can be used for in vitro studies of ap binding, entry, morula development, and cell/cell transfer using standard widefield epifluorescence and confocal techniques for live cell observation and imaging. in previous work using histochemistry and immunostaining we have demonstrated that the development of ap in tick cells differs strikingly from its growth in human cells  <cit> . in human cells, ap forms morulae containing bacteria that are individually visible. in tick cells the morulae often become enlarged and ill defined  <cit> . imaging of gfp/ap in ise <dig> tick cells reveals the same characteristics . gfp/ap grown in hl <dig> and endothelial cells  display the compact, well-defined morulae and pleomorphism seen in non-transformed ap  <cit> .

to date, the visual study of ap in vitro and in vivo has relied upon static fixed samples stained by standard histological techniques. such studies of static specimens can never give a complete picture of the dynamic processes of bacterial growth and development within host cells or animals. indeed, many aspects of morula development and ap/host-cell interaction can only be studied by continuous observation over time, made possible with fluorescent reporter proteins. the combination of fluorescent ap and host cells, each expressing a contrasting fluorescent reporter protein, will allow observation of the development of live ap into morulae, and the passage of ap from cell to cell in an adherent cellular system that is especially amenable to microscopic imaging. towards these ends, the gfp expression obtained in these transformants is bright, and is useful for live cell imaging. the number of distinctly differentially bright ap, when compared to the number of insertions sequenced, suggests that the site of transposon insertion influences expression, as has been found in other systems.

a central goal in our efforts to establish a method for transforming ap has been to produce fluorescent bacteria. live, fluorescent bacteria can be readily imaged in cultured host cells, and in vivo within the cells of the ticks and mammals ap naturally infects. it has been our experience that when passed extensively in vitro  ap loses its infectivity for animals . because our initial efforts at transforming ap have required a substantial amount of in vitro culture , we have been concerned that the transformants that arise will be poorly infective for animals. this has not been the case, however. in preliminary experiments we have found that these transformed ap behave like untransformed parental bacteria; they invade and grow within tick  and primate  cells and infect mice.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we have described a simple method for transformation and selection of ap. the resulting transformants grow normally in all in vitro systems in common use for the culture of these organisms and have successfully infected laboratory mice; suggesting behavior similar to the parental strain. the gfp transformants will prove useful for observation of bacterial binding, entry, growth and cellular exit. these transformation methods should allow gene knock out by random mutagenesis, and the method of spectinomycin selection may prove useful for specific gene knockout by homologous recombination.
