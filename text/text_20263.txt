BACKGROUND
in the past, observation of eating and rumination activities was commonly used by dairy farmers to monitor the health and wellbeing of their cows; some farmers may even have known how long a certain cow chewed her cud. industrialisation of animal farming has drastically changed this and observation of individual cows has become less important in animal husbandry. several techniques have been developed for automated recording of eating and rumination activities . the technique described by nydegger and coworkers  <cit>  recorded jaw movements during chewing using a pressure sensor integrated into the noseband of a halter. the eating and rumination behaviour of cows has been studied recently in our clinic. the first study validated pressure sensor recordings by comparing them with direct observation of eating and rumination over a 24-h period in ten cows  <cit> . the results showed that eating and rumination activities can be easily identified in the recordings and that there is excellent agreement between the automated recordings and direct observation. in another study, eating and rumination behaviour was investigated in cows with various diseases and in the peripartum period  <cit> . eating and rumination behaviour on a winter pasture and under loose-housing conditions was compared in scottish highland cattle  <cit> . the objective of the present study was to examine eating and rumination behaviour in  <dig> dairy cows of different breeds and to establish reference intervals for each breed. an automated system was used to record and analyse eating and rumination variables over a 24-h period in  <dig> brown swiss cows,  <dig> holstein friesian cows and  <dig> swiss fleckvieh cows.

methods
animals
one hundred brown swiss ,  <dig> holstein friesian and  <dig> swiss fleckvieh  cows between  <dig> and 6 years of age  were used . the cows were  <dig> to 20 weeks in milk and the daily production ranged from  <dig> to 45 kg . each breed group was formed to include  <dig> cows aged  <dig> to 4 years , referred to as young cows, and  <dig> cows aged  <dig>  to 6 years , referred to as old cows. the young cows produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg of milk per day and were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  weeks in milk, and the old cows produced  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kg of milk per day and were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  weeks in milk. all cows had been healthy and had not received drugs during the 30-day period before the start of the study.table  <dig> age, milk production and stage of lactation in cows of three breeds and two age groups



housing and feeding
the cows originated from  <dig> dairy farms, which were tie-stall operations with similar management conditions. they had free access to water and were fed hay ad libitum during the day and corn silage/haylage several times a day. concentrate was fed twice a day according to the level of production. all  <dig> herds were free of infectious diseases as bovine rhinotracheitis, bovine virus diarrhoea/mucosal disease and tuberculosis.

recording protocol
the cows were fitted with the recording halter the night before the examination so they could become accustomed to it. recording started at 09: <dig> the next morning and lasted for 24 h. the halter was then removed and the data were analysed.

pressure transducer recordings of eating and rumination activities
the recordings were obtained as described recently  <cit>  using a pressure sensor integrated into the noseband of a horse halter . the sensor recorded the pressure changes that occurred with each jaw movement. the sensor was connected to a data logger , which was kept in a leather pouch on the side of the halter, and contained a secure digital  card to store the data. the sd card had a 4 gb capacity, which allowed a measuring period of 3 weeks. at the end of one measuring period, the data were uploaded from the logger to a personal computer using the sd card.

analysis of pressure transducer recordings
a special software program  was used to evaluate the data. the analysis was done as recently described  <cit> . the measured variables included duration of eating and rumination, number of eating and rumination phases, number of chewing cycles during eating and rumination, number of regurgitated cuds and number of chewing cycles per cud.

statistical analysis
the stata  <dig> software  was used for calculating the means, standard deviations and frequency distributions. sampling was estimated by the following presumptions according to braun et al. : alpha =  <dig> , power =  <dig> , mean1 =  <dig>  mean2 =  <dig>  sd1/2 =  <dig>  n1/n2 =  <dig>  giving n <dig>  n2 =  <dig> or  <dig> as used.

data were tested for normality using the wilk-shapiro test. oneway analysis of variance  was used to identify significant differences among groups, and differences between groups were analysed using the bonferroni test. multivariate anova was used to test for the random effects such as farm. a p-value < <dig>  was considered significant. correlation coefficients were calculated for all eating and rumination variables.

approval of the study by an ethical committee
the study was approved by the ethical committee of the canton of zurich, switzerland.

farm effect on eating and rumination variables
there was a farm effect on duration of eating , number of chewing cycles during eating  and number of chewing cycles per cud  but not on duration of rumination  and the number of regurgitated cuds .

correlations between eating and rumination variables
there were significant correlations  between duration of eating and number of chewing cycles during eating , between duration of rumination and number of chewing cycles per cud  and between duration of rumination and number of regurgitated cuds per day .

discussion
the mean duration of eating during a 24-h period was 265 min . brown swiss cows ate significantly longer than holstein friesian and swiss fleckvieh cows, and older cows ate longer than younger cows regardless of breed. this result was in agreement with published daily eating times of  <dig> to 264 min  <cit> ,  <dig> to 303 min  <cit> ,  <dig> to 292 min  <cit> , 301 min  <cit>  and 330 min  <cit> . one study reported a shorter time of  <dig> to 214 min  <cit> , and in other studies, the upper limit was considerably higher than in the present study:  <dig> to 420 min  <cit> , 462 min  <cit> ,  <dig> to 497 min  <cit> ,  <dig> to 540 min  <cit> . the variation in published reference intervals is related to various factors that affect feed intake including breed, age, body weight and milk production of the cow, type of ration and feeding management, energy requirements, environmental factors and social structure of the herd  <cit> . in our own study  <cit> ), that yielded relatively long eating times, the cows were offered fresh hay day and night and the long eating times confirmed the close relationship between the availability of fresh feed and feed intake  <cit> . in the present study, the cows were fed routinely from early morning until evening, but not during the night.

farm was considered a random variable because it is affected by management, composition of the ration as well as the content of fibre and energy and major and trace elements.

the cows had on average  <dig>  chewing cycles related to eating per day, fewer than values recorded by other authors:  <dig>  cycles  <cit> ,  <dig>  cycles  <cit> ,  <dig>  cycles  <cit> . as expected, the number of chewing cycles was strongly  and positively correlated with the duration of eating.

the mean rumination time was 441 min with a range of  <dig> to 511 min. this was in general agreement with published daily rumination times of  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> to 584 min  <cit> . one study had a range of  <dig> to 621 min and an upper limit that exceeded ours by more than 100 min  <cit> . there are several factors that affect duration of rumination, but the most important is the physical structure of the feed. small feed particles are associated with shorter rumination times . restrictive feeding leads to faster eating and swallowing of larger feed particles and in turn to longer rumination times  <cit> . stress  <cit> , anxiety  <cit>  and illness  lower rumination activity. the percentage of cows that ruminate at a certain time has been used to assess rumen health in dairy cows  <cit> .

the mean number of regurgitated cuds was 578 ±  <dig>  per day, which was in general agreement with published ranges for healthy cows of  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> to  <dig> cuds  <cit> .

the number of chewing cycles per cud  had quite a large variation. ranges observed in other studies were  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> ,  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> to  <dig> chewing cycles per cud  <cit> . cows fed a ration with larger forage particles may respond by increasing the duration of eating and rumination or by increasing the number of chewing cycles per cud  <cit> . the number of chewing cycles also increases with increasing fibre content of the ration  <cit> .

as discussed previously, feed intake is subject to many factors and varies among herds. the results of the present study should therefore be interpreted as guidelines for eating and rumination variables. however, this is the first study of this kind in a large number of cows, which improves the reliability of the presented data, although the findings do not apply universally. eating and rumination characteristics are sensitive indicators of many disorders including postpartum metabolic diseases, and we recommend that large herds establish separate normal ranges when major ration changes occur. in experimental studies, it is critical to include a control group that is kept under identical conditions as the studied group. the intra-individual daily variations of eating and rumination variables are crucial for the assessment of a cow’s health status, analogous to the monitoring of daily milk yield. a sudden drop in eating and rumination activity in an individual cows indicates illness but also can be related to the onset of parturition  <cit> . when multiple cows are affected, external factors should be considered. for instance, when a sudden drop in eating and rumination variables was observed in a small herd of scottish highland cattle, prompt investigation of the problem showed a defective drinking water supply, which had caused the cows to go off feed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the eating and rumination variables established in the present study are based on the observation of  <dig> cows from modern dairy herds, reflect the current conditions of swiss dairy farming and serve as reference intervals for detecting sick cows.
