BACKGROUND
micrornas  are non-coding rnas that are now recognized as a major class of gene-regulating molecules widely distributed in metozoans and plants  <cit> . many mirna genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii, yielding primary mirnas  of hundreds to thousands of bases in length  <cit> . a given pri-mirna can be either monocistronic, containing a sequence for one mature mirna, or polycistronic, containing a sequence for multiple mature mirna products  <cit> . in drosophila, the pri-mirna is processed by a drosha-pasha complex to yield pre-mirna, small stem-loop structures that are approximately  <dig> nucleotides  in length  <cit> . these stem-loops, or hairpins, are then exported to the cytoplasm and processed by dicer- <dig> to form an mirna:mirna* duplex  <cit> . the duplex molecules are separated by a helicase, and based upon the strength of 5' end pairing, one single strand is chosen as the mature mirna  <cit> . the opposing strand is referred to as the mirna* strand, and believed to rapidly degrade following separation  <cit> . mature mirnas associate with an argonaute protein and bind their mrna targets, which are often in the 3' untranslated region , resulting in inhibition of translation or possibly target mrna degradation in animals  <cit> . the "seed region"  contributes significantly to mirna-target recognition  <cit> .

mirnas have been found to play important roles in apoptosis, cancer, development, differentiation, inflammation, longevity, and viral infection  <cit> . estimates of the extent of mirna gene regulation vary from 4% of transcripts in the drosophila ovary  <cit>  to a third of human genes  <cit> . it is estimated that approximately  <dig> different mirnas are expressed across the different life stages of d. melanogaster  <cit> . in flies, the adult stage is characterized by significant mirna expression  <cit> . in a study to uncover drosophila mirnas, lai et al.  reported  <dig> putative mirnas in the african malaria mosquito, anopheles gambiae, that are conserved with drosophila mirnas  <cit> . there are two additional reports describing an. gambiae mirnas on the basis of similarity to known mirnas  <cit> . however, there is no direct experimental evidence for any of these mirnas in mosquitoes. we are interested in identifying conserved as well as mosquito-specific micrornas and exploring their potential functions in mosquito biology and mosquito-pathogen interactions. we carried out our cloning work on 17-day old adult female mosquitoes, which are highly relevant to disease transmission because it takes approximately two weeks for plasmodium parasites to mature and become infective within a female mosquito  <cit> . we used an. stephensi because this species is an important malaria vector in asia and it is becoming a model anopheline species for physiological and genetics studies. here we report direct cloning and characterization of  <dig> conserved and four new mirnas from the an. stephensi adult female. comparative analysis uncovered the loss or significant change of two mirna genes in a divergent mosquito ae. aegypti. we also determined the expression profile of several selected mirnas including the four new mirnas across all life stages of an. stephensi. we performed further expression analysis on two mirnas that are implicated in mosquito reproduction and longevity.

RESULTS
one hundred and forty-eight an. stephensi small rna sequences showed 100% match to the an. gambiae genome assembly and were identified as probable mirna sequences . these small rnas were represented by  <dig> distinct sequences . thirteen additional small rna sequences had  <dig> mismatch to the an. gambiae genome assembly . to be conservative, we only considered these  <dig> sequences as possible mirna candidates  and we did not include them in our list of anopheles mirnas.

 <dig>  we decided to include only mirna candidates that match 100% to a locus in the an. gambiae genome as true mirna candidates shown in table  <dig>  there are several additional mirna candidates that have  <dig> nucleotide mismatch to loci in the an. gambiae genome, which could either result from real differences between an. stephensi and an. gambiae, or errors introduced during cloning or sequencing. these mirna candidates are not included in table  <dig> but are provided in additional file  <dig> as we feel further investigation is necessary to ascertain their identities.

 <dig>  sequences do not match any known mirnas or any other small rnas or mrnas.

 <dig>  low quality sequences and sequences less than  <dig> nucleotides were not analyzed further.

 <dig>  the names for these an. stephensi mirnas are temporarily assigned according to similarity to known mirnas. formal name assignment will be made after mirbase submission. ast stands for an. stephensi. an. stephensi mirnas shown here are divided into two main categories. category i includes mirnas that match an. gambiae mirna predictions that were previously reported in mirbase  or  <cit> , category ib). category ii are mirnas that have not been reported in an. gambiae or any other mosquito species. this category includes mirnas that displayed perfect or near-perfect  match to mirnas from non-mosquito species in mirbase , mirnas that displayed 80% or higher overall similarity to mirnas from non-mosquito species in the mirbase , as well as mirnas that showed no match to any mirnas in mirbase at the default e-value cutoff of  <dig> . mirnas in category iic are temporarily labeled with an "x" in front of an arabic numeral.

 <dig>  a "*" delineates that the sequence matches the mirna* strand of mirna:mirna* heteroduplex.

 <dig>  these are formal names assigned by mirbase, which were received during the proofing stage. see the last paragraph of the discussion section for details.

 <dig>  the longest sequence of each mirna is shown. variants with different ends are shown in additional file  <dig>  the observation of end variants has literary precedence .

 <dig>  occurrence refers to the number of times a sequence appeared during our cloning and sequencing.

 <dig>  location refers to the location of match in the an. gambiae genome as there is no an. stephensi genome assembly available. the location is indicated by chromosome name, start position of the mature mirna, and strand orientation. all matches are 100%.

 <dig>  score refers to the result of mirscan analysis. unless otherwise noted, the pre-mirna sequences used for mirscan are pairs from an. gambiae and ae. aegypti. in the original mirscan paper  <cit> , most of the validated c. elegans mirnas received scores of  <dig> or above although a small number of them received scores significantly less and some even received negative scores.

 <dig>  the precursor sequence of ae. aegypti mir- <dig> contains a large segment in the loop region, which may be the cause for no score or "ns" by mirscan for the an. gambiae and ae. aegypti pre-mir- <dig> alignment. thus an. gambiae and d. melanogaster pre-mir- <dig> alignment was used for mirscan, which produced a score of  <dig> .

 <dig>  we could not find homologs for mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> in ae. aegypti. homologs were found in d. melanogaster , which were used for mirscan analysis shown here.

confirmation of previously predicted anopheline mirnas by direct cloning and northern blot
seventeen of the  <dig> an. stephensi sequences shown in table  <dig> match predicted an. gambiae mirna hairpins . fifteen of the  <dig> matches coincide with the predicted mature mirnas described either at mirbase  <cit>   or in chatterjee and chaudhuri   <cit>  . two sequences appear to be mirnas*, the passenger strand of the mirna:mirna* duplex. the copy numbers of ast-mir-8*, and ast-mir-277* are less than those of ast-mir- <dig> and ast-mir- <dig>  respectively. intriguingly, mir- <dig>  which is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and longevity in d. melanogaster  <cit> , represents 25% of all the identified mirnas. northern analysis using total rna from 17-day old females with antisense locked nucleic acid  probes against  <dig> selected mirnas  all showed bands of the correct size, confirming cloning results . the lna oligos contain a mixture of dna nucleotides and lna nucleotides with 2'-4' methylene linkage providing high binding affinity and enhanced specificity to targets as compared to ordinary dna oligos  <cit> .

six new mirnas in anopheles that are similar to known mirnas from other organisms
three an. stephensi small rnas display perfect or nearly perfect  match to published mirnas from organisms other than mosquitoes  and three more show high similarity  to mirnas from other organisms . these small rnas are named according to their closest mirbase matches, which are listed in additional file  <dig>  all precursor sequences for each of the six mirnas obtained from the an. gambiae genome assembly formed good hairpins . four of the six anopheline mirnas  have conserved sequences in ae. aegypti and comparisons between the anopheles and aedes hairpins produced mirscan scores ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , supporting their mirna status . mirscan looks for hallmarks of mirnas within a pair of conserved precursor stem-loop sequences by calculating a score based on seven criteria, the most important of which is the conservation of the base pairing between a mirna and its antisense  <cit> . two of the mirnas, ast-mir- <dig> and ast-mir- <dig>  do not have conserved sequences  in ae. aegypti and are described in the next section. we selected ast-mir- <dig>  a mirna that showed the lowest similarity to known mirnas in category iia and iib, for further verification using ribonuclease protection assay , which is theoretically more sensitive than northern blot . a product of expected size was detected thus supporting the expression of ast-mir- <dig> 

two of the above mirnas are worth noting. ast-mir-2a matches dme-mir-2a perfectly thus is named as mir-2a. there is an aga-mir- <dig> in mirbase , which is reverse complementary to ast-mir-2a. sequence comparison showed that ast-mir-2a is not derived from aga-mir-2* because of the existence of multiple indels/mismatches between the alignment of aga-mir- <dig> and aga-mir-2*. the orientation of our cloned ast-mir-2a is consistent with the mirscan prediction based on an. gambiae and ae. aegypti hairpins . in addition, ast-mir- <dig> is reverse complementary to its top match  with 86% identity, which is described in the next section.

anopheles mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are in two separate mirna clusters located in introns of protein-coding genes
as mentioned above, anopheles mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> do not have conserved sequences in ae. aegypti. however, they both have homologs in d. melanogaster . comparisons between mir- <dig> sequences in an. gambiae and d. melanogaster produced a mirscan score of  <dig> , which is consistent with its mirna status. comparisons between mir- <dig> sequences in an. gambiae and d. melanogaster produced no score  during mirscan analysis. the failure to produce a positive score by mirscan does not automatically indicate that mir- <dig> is not a true mirna because nine out of the  <dig> known c. elegans/c. briggsae mirnas produced no scores and two even gave negative scores  <cit> . a closer examination of the mir- <dig> hairpin from an. gambiae suggested that it met all of the previously described criteria for mirna structures  <cit> .

interestingly, mir- <dig> is closely flanked by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> while mir- <dig> is in a different cluster with mir-9b and mir- <dig> . clustering of an. gambiae mir-9b and mir- <dig> is noted on mirbase, but not mir-306; clustering of an. gambiae mir- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig> is not predicted in mirbase  <cit> . both clusters are within introns of protein coding genes. the mir- <dig>  - <dig>  - <dig> cluster occurs within a conserved gene of unknown function, while the mir-9b, - <dig>  - <dig> cluster occurs within an ortholog of a gene coding for a drosophila serine-threonine kinase group protein. the exons flanking each of the mirna clusters are conserved between an. gambiae, ae. aegypti, and d. melanogaster, which indicates that the clusters are orthologous. the order of mirnas within the introns is conserved between an. gambiae and d. melanogaster, again supporting the mirna status of the anopheles mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  all mirnas in the two clusters are in the same orientation as the flanking genes, indicating that these mirnas may be transcribed from the promoters of their respective flanking genes, which is consistent with previous reports  <cit> . in this regard, it is suggestive that, albeit reverse complementary to each other, the mature mir- <dig> in anopheles and drosophila are both correctly annotated because the orientation of transcription of mir- <dig> is consistent with the flanking gene in both species.

discovery of four novel mosquito mirnas that have no apparent homolog outside of mosquitoes
as shown in category iic of table  <dig>  there are four an. stephensi small rnas that produced no hits to any known mirnas from any species based upon searches of the mirbase with an e-value cutoff of  <dig>  these sequences are temporarily named ast-mir-x <dig> through ast-mir-x <dig>  all four sequences match perfectly to unique locations in the an. gambiae genome assembly. putative precursor sequences flanking the four mirnas in an. gambiae showed strong hairpin structures . the precursors of all four mirnas showed high similarity to ae. aegypti genomic sequences and these hairpin pairs gave mirscan scores between  <dig> – <dig> , indicating that they strongly resemble the structure and conservation pattern of known mirnas. in particular, the mature mirna sequences were 100% conserved between an. gambiae, an. stephensi, and ae. aegypti. northern blot analysis using 17-day old female samples provided further confirmation for these four mirnas .

expression profile of mosquito mirnas across different developmental stages
we decided to expand the expression analysis beyond the adult stage and investigate the expression profiles of eight mirnas across different developmental stages, from early embryo to female adult. shown in figure  <dig> are northern blot results for four known mirnas as well as all four new mirnas. each mirna showed a distinct pattern. mir-9a is expressed in all life stages examined and its expression is reduced in adults, which is consistent with what was observed in d. melanogaster  <cit> . the level of mir- <dig> appears to be higher in late embryo and adult females than in other stages. let- <dig> expression begins in late larvae in mosquitoes and continues into adult, again similar to what was observed in d. melanogaster. we also determined the expression profile of mir- <dig>  which represents 25% of the mirna sequences during our cloning experiment . as shown in figure  <dig>  mir- <dig> displays a strong signal starting from late embryonic to adult stages. mir- <dig> is observed in all life stages in d. melanogaster as well  <cit> . further examination of mir- <dig> expression across adult lifespan showed a relatively consistent expression regardless of age, sex, and hematophagy . the four novel mirnas  have unique expression patterns as well, which will likely provide useful clues to their function for future research. for example, mir-x <dig> showed adult-specific expression while mir-x <dig> showed predominantly pre-adult expression . mir-x <dig> was not detected in adult males . mir-x <dig> was at best weakly expressed in adult males while mir-x <dig> and x <dig> were clearly expressed in adult males .

mir-x <dig> in both an. stephensi and ae. aegypti is predominantly found in the ovaries and its level is significantly reduced  <dig> hrs after blood feeding
we decided to carry out a detailed expression analysis of mir-x <dig> in both an. stephensi and ae. aegypti. when different an. stephensi tissues were analyzed , mir-x <dig> showed strong signals in ovaries while no expression was detected in the midgut samples. the expression of mir-x <dig> was weak in the heads and the "remainders" . following blood feeding, mir-x <dig> expression in the ovaries remained high at  <dig> hours post bloodmeal, but declined sharply by  <dig> hours post bloodmeal. mir-x <dig> was hardly detectable among the other tissues in either of the post bloodmeal time points. the same pattern of expression was observed in the distantly related ae. aegypti . we also confirmed the lack of mir-x <dig> expression in adult males in both an. stephensi and ae. aegypti . thus mir-x <dig> expression profile is conserved between the two divergent mosquitoes in all samples tested.

discussion
two criteria are critical for demonstrating a valid mirna  <cit> . first, expression of an approximately  <dig> nt rna should be detected by small rna cloning or by rna hybridization methods such as northern blot  <cit> . second, the mirna should be traceable back to a precursor with a hairpin structure  <cit> . all  <dig> mirnas described in this report, including two mirna* sequences, met the above criteria. the expression was indicated by direct cloning of small rnas from 17-day old female an. stephensi samples and the precursor hairpin was identified using the genome assembly of a related anopheles species of the same subgenus, an. gambiae. additional evidence to validate mirna status that was proposed in the literature includes proof of processing to a mature form via dicer, and conservation of the mature sequence and its precursor  <cit> . for all  <dig> anopheles mirnas, we were able to identify conserved sequences encompassing the entire hairpin structure either from the genome assembly of a divergent mosquito species, ae. aegypti  or from d. melanogaster . furthermore, mirscan analysis based on conserved hairpin alignment provided strong support for  <dig> of the  <dig> anopheline mirnas. in the case of ast-mir- <dig>  which has no conserved sequence in ae. aegypti and no mirscan score, a closer examination of the mir- <dig> hairpin from an. gambiae suggests that it meets all of previously described criteria for mirna structures  <cit> . furthermore, the anopheles mir- <dig> and the d. melanogaster mir- <dig> are both in a conserved mirna cluster and both are flanked by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  thus lending additional support for the validity of anopheles mir- <dig>  finally mirna expression was detected for all nine selected ast-mirnas during either northern blot or rpa, complementing our cloning results. thus we feel that the overall support for the presence of these  <dig> mirnas in anopheles mosquitoes is strong. one mirna, ast-mir-2a, is worth noting. cloning results for ast-mir-2a, comparisons to dme-mir-2a, and mirscan predictions are all consistent. however, ast-mir-2a is reverse complementary to the aga-mir- <dig> reported in mirbase.

as mentioned earlier, mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> do not have obvious homologs in ae. aegypti. in both an. gambiae and d. melanogaster, mir- <dig> is closely flanked by mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> while mir- <dig> is in a different cluster with mir-9b and mir- <dig> . both clusters are in the intron of orthologous genes in the two species. comparisons of the two mirnas clusters in these three species  would suggest that mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> may have either been lost in ae. aegypti or evolved to significantly different sequences. as the mature mirna sequences of the anopheles and drosophila mir- <dig> are reverse complementary to each other, it is possible that the mir- <dig> precursor sequence may have undergone an inversion after the two dipteran lineages separated. thus comparisons of clear orthologous mirna clusters will likely shed new light on the evolution  of mirnas, which has not been well studied.

the expression profiles of the eight mosquito mirnas are informative. when d. melanogaster data are available for comparison as in the cases of let- <dig> and mir-9a, similar expression profiles were found between an. stephensi and d. melanogaster. this is not surprising as these conserved mirnas are likely to have similar functions in these dipteran insects. mir- <dig> was expressed in the same stages in an. stephensi as in d. melanogaster. we provided extended expression analysis on mir- <dig>  the mirna that represents 25% of the sequenced mirnas during the cloning of the 17-day old an. stephensi samples. we showed that the mir- <dig> level increased slightly during embryonic development and remained relatively high through larvae, pupae and adult stages and we did not observe significant changes in adults regardless of age, sex, and blood feeding status. these results do not necessarily imply that mosquito mir- <dig> is important to longevity, a function of mir- <dig> demonstrated in d. melanogaster. nonetheless, it appears that mir- <dig> is important across different mosquito life stages from embryos to aged adults. further research on the targets and function of mir- <dig> in mosquitoes will help determine whether it is important to mosquito longevity. the expression profile of mir-x <dig> through mir-x <dig> confirmed our cloning results for these new mirnas, and provided useful information for future research into their functions. the expression of mir-x <dig> in an. stephensi was adult specific as well as female specific. mir-x <dig> was predominantly expressed in the ovary and its level was reduced  <dig> hrs after blood feeding. these results indicate that mir-x <dig> is likely involved in an. stephensi female reproduction. the same pattern of expression was shown for mir-x <dig> in ae. aegypti, a mosquito that is highly divergent from an. stephensi. thus the function of mir-x <dig> may be conserved among divergent mosquitoes.

we have identified  <dig> mirnas previously unknown to mosquitoes, four of which did not match any known mirnas in any organism. these four mirnas are conserved between an. stephensi, an. gambiae, and ae. aegypti, suggesting important functions possibly common to all mosquitoes as the anopheles and aedes genera are two of the most divergent among all mosquitoes, separated approximately 145– <dig> million years ago  <cit> . considering the modest number of small rna clones we sequenced during this study and the specific developmental stage of our total rna source, we suspect that a number of novel mirnas still await to be discovered in mosquitoes. this study demonstrates the importance of direct cloning and expression profile analysis to the identification and characterization of conserved as well as mosquito-specific micrornas, some of which will likely regulate genes that significantly affect mosquito biology and perhaps mosquito-pathogen interactions.

three research articles became available when this manuscript was being reviewed. two of these papers describe additional mirnas from drosophila  <cit>  and a third paper reports cloning of  <dig> distinct mirnas and primer extension analysis of an additional  <dig> mirnas from an. gambiae midgut samples infected with plasmodium bergei  <cit> . comparisons between the  <dig> mirnas reported in this manuscript and those published in the above three papers showed that an. stephensi mir-x <dig> and mir-x <dig> are nearly identical to an. gambiae mir- <dig> and mir- <dig>  respectively  <cit>  and homologs of these two mirnas are found in the expanded list of drosophila mirnas  <cit> . thus mir-x <dig> and mir-x <dig> are not unique to mosquitoes. ast-mir- <dig> showed a perfect match to the newly identified mir- <dig> in drosophila  <cit> , thus ast-mir- <dig> should be renamed as ast-mir- <dig>  an additional five of the cloned mirnas reported in winter et al.  <cit>  match five of the  <dig> mirnas reported in this manuscript. they are let- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir- <dig>  an. stephensi mir-x <dig> and mir-x <dig> showed no similarity to any mirnas in the mirbase which included updates from the above three papers. thus mir-x <dig> and mir-x <dig> remain novel and potentially specific to mosquitoes. the final names of these mirnas as assigned by mirbase are shown in table  <dig>  we also compared mirna expression profiles obtained in our study using northern analysis with the profiles of overlapping mirnas reported in winter et al.  <cit> , which were obtained using primer extension. winter and colleagues state that mir- <dig>  is expressed only in midguts of an. gambiae . however, we have shown that mir-x <dig>  is predominantly expressed in ovaries in both an. stephensi and ae. aegypti and mir-x <dig> was not detected in midguts under our condition. we note that the figure  <dig> of winter et al.  <cit>  does show a much stronger expression in "leftovers", which include ovaries, than in midguts.

CONCLUSIONS
this study provides experimental evidence for  <dig> conserved and four new micrornas in an. stephensi mosquitoes. comparisons between mirna gene clusters in an. gambiae, ae. aegypti, and d. melanogaster suggest the loss or significant change of two mirna genes in ae. aegypti. expression profile analysis of eight mirnas, including the four new mirnas, revealed distinct patterns from early embryo to adult stages in an. stephensi. further analysis showed that mir-x <dig> is likely involved in female reproduction and its function may be conserved among divergent mosquitoes. consistent expression of mir- <dig> suggests that mir- <dig> is likely important across all mosquito life stages from embryos to aged adults. understanding the functions of mosquito mirnas will undoubtedly contribute to a better understanding of mosquito biology including longevity, reproduction, and mosquito-pathogen interactions, which are important to disease transmission.
