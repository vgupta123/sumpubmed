BACKGROUND
bacteria widely distributed in soil and water, or coexistence with other creatures, which are the most one in all organisms. all bacteria are grouped into prokaryotes that have a very simple cell structure lacking a cell nucleus, mitochondria and chloroplasts. bacteria can be classified into two groups via gram staining method: gram-positive and gram-negative. the former are stained dark blue or violet by gram staining, while the latter instead appear red or pink. because the functions of proteins are closely related to their subcellular locations, knowing subcellular locations of proteins in a bacterial cell can help biologists elucidating the functions of proteins and thus screening candidates in drug design.

nowadays, there are two methods for identifying the subcellular locations of proteins: biochemical experiments and computational methods. in the post-genomic era, with the completion of various sequencing projects, new protein sequences have grown exponentially  <cit> . the biochemical experiments not only consume a lot of time but also pay high costs, and thus they have not adapted to the new situation. it is required to develop computational methods to identify the subcellular locations of these proteins automatically and accurately.

computational methods for protein subcellular localization prediction can be roughly divided into the following four groups:  sequence-based methods;  sorting-signals based methods;  homology-based methods and  annotation-based methods. sequence-based methods include, such as amino acid compositions   <cit> , amino acid pair compositions or dipeptide compositions  <cit> , gapped amino acid pair compositions  <cit> , and pseudo amino acid composition   <cit> ; sorting-signals based methods, such as psort  <cit> , wolf psort  <cit> , targetp  <cit>  and signalp  <cit> ; homology-based methods, such as proteome analyst  <cit>  and pairprosvm  <cit> ; annotation-based methods, such as multiloc <dig>  <cit> , sherloc <dig>  <cit> , hum-ploc  <cit> , gneg-ploc  <cit> , iloc-hum  <cit> , proloc-go  <cit> .

although there exist a lot of prediction methods for subcellular localization of proteins, the majority of these methods can only deal with single-location proteins. but unfortunately many multi-location proteins are located at more than one location site simultaneously. when prediction models are constructed by these methods, multi-location proteins are not included in the training set. actually, multi-location proteins have special biological functions capable of helping the development of new drugs.

there are only a few predictors  <cit>  specifically developed for predicting gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins. to the best of our knowledge, there are only four predictors, namely gpos-mploc  <cit> , iloc-gpos  <cit> , gneg-mploc  <cit>  and iloc-gneg  <cit> , capable of predicting multi-label gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins. iloc-gpos and iloc-gneg perform better than gpos-mploc and gneg-mploc respectively because the formers propose a better prediction algorithm to identity sub-cellular locations of query proteins.

in this article, two efficient multi-label predictors, gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc, are proposed to predict the subcellular locations of multi-label gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins respectively. the two multi-label predictors extract go feature vectors from go terms of homologs of query proteins and then adopt a powerful multi-label ensemble classifier to output the final multi-label prediction results. experimental results show that gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc can efficiently predict the subcellular locations of multi-label gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins respectively. for readers'convenience, we developed the online web servers for gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc predictors which are freely accessible at http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/gpos-ecc-mploc/ and http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/gneg-ecc-mploc/ respectively.

RESULTS
datasets
in this article, the gram-positive bacterial benchmark dataset used in gpos-mploc  <cit>  and iloc-gpos  <cit>  and the gram-negative bacterial benchmark dataset used in gneg-mploc  <cit>  and iloc-gneg  <cit>  are utilized to evaluate the prediction performance of gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc respectively.

the gram-positive bacterial dataset consists of  <dig> gram-positive bacterial proteins, which are distributed in  <dig> locations . of the  <dig> gram-positive bacterial proteins,  <dig> belong to one subcellular location,  <dig> to two locations, and none to more locations. the number of locative proteins in this dataset is  <dig>  the concept of locative proteins and actual proteins have been explained in detail in literature  <cit> . the sequence identity in this dataset is controlled fewer than 25%.

the gram-negative bacterial dataset consists of  <dig> gram-negative bacterial proteins, which are distributed in  <dig> locations . of the  <dig> gram-negative bacterial proteins,  <dig> belong to one subcellular location,  <dig> to two locations, and none to more locations. the number of locative proteins in this dataset is  <dig>  the sequence identity in this dataset is also controlled fewer than 25%.

performance measures
in this article, we use the  locative and absolute accuracy to measure the performance of multi-label predictors. the overall locative and absolute accuracy are defined as follows:

  overall locative accuracy=1nloc ∑i=1ndifyi∩zi 

  overall absolute accuracy=1ndif ∑i=1ndif <dig> 

where yi is the set of true labels of each protein, zi the set of predicted labels of each one, nloc the number of locative proteins, ndif the number of different proteins, | - | the operator acting on the set to count the number of its elements, ∩ the intersection of sets,  <dig> equals  <dig> if true labels are entirely identical to predicted labels,  <dig> otherwise.

when and only when all of the subcellular locations of a query protein are exactly predicted, the prediction result of the query protein can be considered as correct. therefore, the overall absolute accuracy is stricter than the overall locative accuracy. for the two measures, more detailed explanation can be found in  <cit> .

comparison with the state-of-the-art predictors
in statistical prediction, the jackknife test, also named leave-one-out cross validation, is considered as the most rigorous and objective evaluation method  <cit> . the jackknife test has been widely utilized by researchers to evaluate the performance of various prediction methods  <cit> . hence, in this article, we also use the jackknife test to evaluate the prediction performance of our proposed gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc predictors.

for the gpos-ecc-mploc predictor, we compare our proposed gpos-ecc-mploc predictor with two state-of-the-art gram-positive bacterial multi-label predictors, i.e., gpos-mploc  <cit>  and iloc-gpos  <cit>  predictors. for the gneg-ecc-mploc predictor, we also compare our proposed gneg-ecc-mploc predictor with two state-of-the-art gram-negative bacterial multi-label predictors, i.e., gneg-mploc  <cit>  and iloc-gneg  <cit>  predictors. ensemble sizes of multi-label ensemble classifiers  used in gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc are respectively set to  <dig> and  <dig> for achieving the best performance.

as can be seen from table  <dig> and  <dig>  for the gram-positive bacterial dataset, gpos-ecc-mploc performs better than gpos-mploc and iloc-gpos; for the gram-negative bacterial dataset, gneg-ecc-mploc also performs better than gneg-mploc and iloc-gneg. specifically, in the gram-positive bacterial dataset, the overall locative accuracy achieved by gpos-ecc-mploc is  <dig> %, which is more than 12% higher than that achieved by gpos-mploc and 1% higher than that achieved by iloc-gpos, while the overall absolute accuracy of gpos-ecc-mploc is  <dig> %, which is more than 1% higher than iloc-gpos; and in the gram-negative bacterial dataset, gneg-ecc-mploc achieves  <dig> % overall locative accuracy, with more than 8% performance improvement against gneg-mploc and approximately 3% improvement against iloc-gneg, while gneg-ecc-mploc achieves  <dig> % overall absolute accuracy, with approximately 3% improvement against iloc-gneg. the results on both datasets show that gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc are more capable of handling multi-label problems than gpos-mploc, iloc-gpos, gneg-mploc and iloc-gneg. that is because gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc take correlations among subcellular locations into account, while gpos-mploc, iloc-gpos, gneg-mploc and iloc-gneg only transform the multi-label classification problem to one single-label classification problem and thus lose the beneficial label correlations information. moreover, ensembling multiple multi-label classifiers in gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc further enhances the prediction performance. as for the individual locative accuracy, in the gram-positive bacterial dataset, gpos-ecc-mploc achieves the similar locative accuracies to iloc-gpos for the 'cell membrane', 'cell wall' and 'cytoplasm', while the locative accuracy of gpos-ecc-mploc is remarkably higher than iloc-gpos for the 'extracell'; in the gram-negative bacterial dataset, the locative accuracies of gneg-ecc-mploc for all of the  <dig> locations are significantly higher than gneg-mploc, except for the 'cell inner membrane', 'fimbrium' and 'flagellum' for which both gneg-ecc-mploc and iloc-gneg achieve the similar locative accuracies, while gneg-ecc-mploc performs remarkably better than iloc-gneg for the rest of location sites.

CONCLUSIONS
in this article, we propose two efficient multi-label predictors, gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc, to predict the subcellular locations of multi-label gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins respectively. the two multi-label predictors use the go terms of homologous proteins of query proteins to construct the go vectors and then the go vectors are fed into the powerful ensemble of classifier chains  classifier for generating the final multi-label prediction results. compared with the existing predictors, gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc have three following advantages:  cc takes the correlations among different labels into account and then improves the prediction performance of multi-label proteins;  ecc ensembles multiple cc classifiers and can generate better prediction results by ensemble learning; and  they construct the go vectors by using the frequency of occurrences of go terms in the typical homologous set instead of using 0/ <dig> values.

experimental results show that gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc can efficiently predict the subcellular locations of multi-label gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial proteins respectively. for readers'convenience, the online web servers for gpos-ecc-mploc and gneg-ecc-mploc predictors are freely accessible at http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/gpos-ecc-mploc/ and http://biomed.zzuli.edu.cn/bioinfo/gneg-ecc-mploc/ respectively.
