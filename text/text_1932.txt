BACKGROUND
s. aureus is a highly versatile gram positive organism capable of being a commensal and causing a variety of diseases such as soft tissue infections, bacterial endocarditis, septicemia and osteomyelitis. the ability of the organism to cause a multitude of infections is probably due to the expression of myriads of different toxins, virulence factors and also cell wall adhesion proteins and staphylococcal superantigen like proteins  involved in immune-evasion. the emergence of mrsa in most countries of the world is a cause of great concern. vancomycin resistance, in addition, has left physicians with limited treatment options  <cit> .

the distinction between ha- mrsa and ca- mrsa was clear when ca-mrsa were first reported. ca-mrsa originated with individuals in the community who had none of the risk factors from exposure to hospital environment and had distinctly different antibiotic sensitivities than the ha-mrsa which infected hospitalized patients with specific risks of infections. but in the last five years, ca-mrsa have infiltrated the hospitals and are replacing ha-mrsa, mainly in countries where the prevalence of ca-mrsa is high  <cit> .

 methicillin resistance is conferred on the organism by the presence of a unique mobile genetic element called the sccmec carrying the meca gene. the sccmec elements are divided into different types based on the nucleotide differences in two essential components, ccr  gene complex, represented by ccr genes and mec gene complexes. eight major types of sccmec elements were reported till recently but three more new types have been added in the past few months from bovine and human origins increasing the total to eleven sccmec types  <cit> . ha-mrsa isolates contain mainly type i, ii, and iii sccmec elements while ca-mrsa contain type iv and v sccmec elements each of which has several variants. for instance, majority of indian ha-mrsa collected between  <dig> and  <dig> contained type iii or iiia sccmec elements, as previously reported  <cit> .

we reported in  <dig> the presence of pvl positive st <dig>  and st <dig>  as major clones in nasal swabs collected in healthy carriers in and around bengaluru in a small number of samples  <cit> . recently, our studies in carriers and individuals with disease from rural and urban areas of bengaluru showed variants of emrsa- <dig> clones  <cit> . another study from a tertiary care hospital in mumbai also demonstrated the presence of emrsa- <dig> as a major clone among patients  <cit> . a second important clone is the pvl-positive st <dig> which has been detected in and around bengaluru, mumbai , bangladesh and malaysia  <cit> . these two dominant epidemic clones are associated with both ca- and ha-infections in india and seem to have progressively replaced the st <dig> clone in hospitals  <cit> .

aim of this study was to establish the lineage of sensitive and resistant s. aureus strains collected from in and around bengaluru and three other cities in india, and determine their toxins and virulence factors. in this article, mrsa and mssa collected either from ha- and ca-infections or carriages were characterized using the microarray system developed by clonediag® which detects  <dig> alleles of the s. aureus genome  <cit> . this characterization complemented those obtained by multi-locus sequence typing , staphylococcal protein a  typing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis , pcr to confirm the sccmec type, toxin gene content, and antibiograms. the two already-reported st <dig> and st <dig> clones were detected as mssa and mrsa. the spreading of st <dig> along with an emerging clone of pvl-negative st <dig> among indian ca-mrsa is being reported in this study. the indian mssa clones identified were much more diverse and were different from the mrsa clones, except for st <dig> and  <dig> which were detected in both mrsa and mssa groups. the livestock-associated st <dig> related clone  is reported for the first time in two mssa isolates.

RESULTS
carrier and disease s. aureus isolates
carrier  and disease  isolates were collected from rural, urban out patient and urban in patient environments and analysis is presented in table  <dig> 

1new spa types reported to the data base;  <dig>  <dig> isolate is agr negative.

twenty six percent of carrier isolates and sixty percent of disease isolates were mrsa. all mrsa carried sccmec type iv or v. total of  <dig> sts were present among all the  <dig> isolates characterized. all but one sequence type were present in carrier isolates. st  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were present among disease isolates. st  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 291were present only among carriers. antibiotic sensitivity to five antibiotics -oxacillin, cefoxitin, erythromycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline were tested on all the strains . isolates belonging exclusively to carrier sts were sensitive to all the antibiotics tested. predominant methicillin resistant sts were  <dig>  and  <dig>  along with small percentage of isolates belonging to st <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> carrying  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  percent of isolates respectively as mrsa. carrier mrsa isolates were limited to st <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> while disease mrsa isolates in addition included st <dig>  all carrier and disease isolates of st <dig> and  <dig> lineage were pvl and egc positive.

mlst types
twelve s. aureus cc  were identified with three of the clones detected in more than 10% of the isolates  . new or recently emerging clones were also detected . figure  <dig> shows the eburst analysis and lineages of all sequence types. details of all the sts follow as given below. cc and sts of mssa were much more diverse than those of mrsa . isolates belonged to all the  <dig> agr types. new spa types were detected among mrsa and mssa isolates of lineages st <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  pvl genes were detected in 69% of the isolates and egc in 84%. microarray analysis was performed for representative carrier and disease isolates from each sequence type to determine the virulent factors and toxins.

microarray
factors which were common to all isolates when analyzing the microarray results, were as follows: virulence factor genes- α, γ, δ haemolysins, staphylococcal complement inhibitor , aureolysin, sspa, sspb and sspp; mscramms genes- fnba, fib, ebps, vwb, sdrc; clumping factors a and b; bbp ; map  and immune-evasion genes- isab, isda, imrp, mprf, hysa <dig>  hysa <dig>  set  <dig>  ssl <dig> were present in all except in one isolate of st <dig> and one isolate of st <dig>  ssl <dig> absent only in one isolate of st <dig>  the patterns of presence and absence of virulence and immune evasion factors strictly followed the sequence type. carrier and disease isolates belonging to a particular st type had the same patterns. raw microarray data of  <dig> isolates is provided as an additional file  <dig>  in a few cases where results were ambiguous, results have been confirmed with pcrs.

pfge
cc22-st22
st <dig> is the major clone detected in 28% of the isolates present in both carrier and disease isolates. methicillin resistance was detected in 68% in both groups, and the mrsa isolates had a sccmec iv element. pfge patterns of all st <dig> isolates resembled classical emrsa- <dig> patterns with 3– <dig> band differences and were related variants  <cit> . spa types from mssa isolates differed from those of mrsa. st <dig> is the clone most resistant to antibiotics with resistance to gentamicin and erythromycin, in mrsa as well as mssa, both in carriers and infected patients. this clone was agr type i, capsular type  <dig>  pvl and egc positive.

cc1-st772
this is the second major clone present in our collection detected in 19% of the isolates both in carrier and disease isolates. methicillin resistance was detected in 69% in both groups and the isolates had a sccmec v element. isolates with resistance to gentamicin and erythromycin were found in mrsa only, but both in carriers and infected patients. spa types from mssa isolates differed from mrsa. this clone was agr type ii, capsular type  <dig>  pvl and egc positive.

cc121-st <dig> and st121
the st120/ <dig> clones were detected in 10% of the isolates both in carriers and patients. methicillin resistance as well as resistance to other antibiotics was not detected in any of the isolates. this clone was agr type iv, capsular type  <dig>  pvl and egc positive.

st672
we are reporting a new sequence type from india, which appears to have the potential to be a founder clone. this clone was detected in 6% of the isolates in both carrier and disease isolates. methicillin and gentamicin resistance was detected in  <dig> disease isolates with a sccmec v element. spa types from mssa isolates differed from those of mrsa. this clone was agr type i, capsular type  <dig>  pvl negative and egc and seb positive.

cc8-st <dig> and st72
st <dig> is a new single locus variant  of st <dig> and st <dig> is a double locus variant . one st <dig> isolate was pvl positive. all three st <dig> mrsa isolates and one st <dig> mssa isolate were resistant to gentamicin and erythromycin. these clones were agr type i, and capsular polysaccharide type  <dig> 

cc30-st <dig> and st39
cc <dig> was represented by  <dig> isolates from the community and the hospitals belonging to st <dig> and one st <dig> carrier isolate . methicillin and erythromycin resistance was detected in one st <dig> carrier isolate with sccmec type ivc. all isolates were agr type iii. this is the only sccmec type ivc isolate belonging to agr type iii in our collection with a distinct pfge pattern different from emrsa- <dig>  except for one carrier st <dig> mssa isolate, all isolates were pvl and egc positive and belonged to capsular polysaccharide type  <dig> 

cc398-st291
this is the first report of two carrier mssa isolates which are related to s. aureus from bovine origin. st <dig> is a dlv of st <dig> and spa types t <dig> and t <dig> differed by one repeat unit. no antibiotic resistance was detected. pfge patterns of these two isolates were very closely related with one band difference. these two isolates contained exotoxin d  and edinb  unlike other isolates and were negative for pvl and tst and contained capsular polysaccharide type  <dig> 

cc45-st <dig>  cc5-st <dig>  cc15-st <dig>  st <dig> and st7
these five other sts included  <dig> isolates with various characteristics. methicillin resistant isolates were not detected among these sts, as well as other antibiotic resistance determinants. the pvl genes were detected in two isolates. while st <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had capsular polysaccharide type  <dig>  cc <dig> contained type  <dig> 

differences in sccmec elements of mrsa isolates
* second ccr c present in sccmeczh <dig> 

isolates carrying sccmec type iv cassettes did not amplify primers specific for iva, ivb, ivc, ivd and ivh. previous work from our laboratory has shown several variants of classical emrsa- <dig> in pfge patterns, and the j regions could be different from the known st <dig>  emrsa- <dig> isolates  <cit> . one st <dig> carrier isolate carrying sccmec type iv has a different pfge pattern from that of st <dig>  and amplified primers specific for sccmec type ivc.

differences in type v sccmec elements
sccmec type v elements were present in three different classes of sts- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  pcrs to identify different regions of type v elements , genbank accession no. ab121219) and microarray of selected isolates pointed to two different variants of type v element as shown in table  <dig> . ccrc, meca and ugpq  were present in all type v isolates while only isolates belonging to st <dig> and st <dig> carried a second ccrc region in the sccmeczh <dig> in the microarray from the mosaic cassette zh <dig> reported by heuser et al  <cit> . this region was positive by pcr using primers specific for the second ccrc in the sccmeczh <dig> region with a size of 435 bp and is identical in sequence to isolates containing composite cassettes of sccmec type v . type v isolates belonging to cc <dig> did not carry the second ccrc region. sccmeczh <dig> also contain ccra2ccrb <dig> and a very small truncated mecr region which did not amplify in our st <dig> and st <dig> isolates by pcr and microarray. apart from amplifying the mecc <dig> complex upstream of meca, none of the primers designed for several different regions of sccmec type v based on sequences from wis strain, amplified dna from our type v isolates indicating that the j regions could be different. all isolates belonging to st <dig> and  <dig> amplified primers for both hsdr and hsdm regions while st <dig> isolates did not amplify the hsdr region indicating there could be changes in this region as well . no dna fragments targeting hsds, which determine the specificity of restriction modification system, were amplified with dnas of all isolates. the other genes indicated in table 2c are selected from the microarray data to examine the differences among isolates belonging to different sts.

discussion
we have characterized s. aureus isolates from different cities in india, which belong to a wide variety of sts from healthy carriers and individuals with simple to complicated diseases. even in a small number of isolates , there were  <dig> different sts  and mssa isolates were the most diverse. among the mrsa isolates, the predominant st were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  st <dig> is a new emerging clone with only two isolates reported from australia and u.s. while emrsa- <dig>  appeared as a major clone in indian hospitals with sccmec type iv element, st <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are emerging as sccmec type v. it is evident from our studies that at least two different types of sccmec type v elements exist in isolates belonging to three distinct sts.

the most obvious bias in the study is the limited number of isolates collected, but our results are in part concordant with those in the literature: the two major mrsa sts  reported earlier in india  <cit> . many of the other mssa and two of the mrsa sts are being reported for the first time.

the antibiotic sensitivity data  indicates that majority of carrier mssa were sensitive to all five tested antibiotics. antibiotic resistant determinants were found mainly in carrier and disease mrsa isolates, but few st <dig> carrier and disease mssa isolates also had resistance determinants for gentamicin and /or erythromycin. for few mrsa isolates  containing the meca gene, mics for oxacillin and cefoxitin were 4– <dig> and 8-16 μg/ml respectively while for most other isolates the corresponding values were 8– <dig> and 16-32 μg/ml . we considered these isolates as methicillin resistant as the patient treatment with oxacillin would select for resistance in a heterogeneous population containing the meca gene. similar mrsa isolates of st <dig> background were found in taiwan  <cit>  and cc <dig> lineage in switzerland among injection drug users. one of the swiss isolates of cc <dig>  has been reported to have low mic for oxacillin and sequenced to contain a composite sccmec cassette with zh <dig> region containing a second ccrc. our isolates of st <dig> and st <dig> with low level of oxacillin resistance also contain the second ccrc region. the low level of resistance has been attributed to mutations in the meca promoter region  <cit> .

emrsa- <dig>  has been reported to be replacing ha-mrsa in hospitals in many countries - germany, portugal, singapore, to name just a few  <cit> . in  <dig> when we had collected mrsa isolates from indian hospitals  <cit> , majority of them belonged to st <dig> with sccmec type iii or iiia; st <dig> now made up 28% of the total in the present collection. a study from mumbai, india, with larger sample numbers, from a tertiary care hospital also indicates that emrsa- <dig> is replacing type iii sccmec containing isolates  <cit> .

st <dig>  has been reported from india, bangladesh and malaysia  <cit> . our st <dig> isolates and that from bangladesh have agr type ii while cc <dig> isolates from malaysia, australia and u.s. have been reported to be agr type iii. aires de sousa et al., have reported three sequence types  belonging to cc <dig>  as agr types i, ii, and iii respectively in a survey of isolates from portuguese hospitals and community  <cit> . cc <dig> lineage itself seems to be changing from an independent founder to a sub-founder and cc <dig> is evolving as the founder strain from the eburst analysis . st <dig> appears to be the link between the founder and sub-founder clones. cc <dig> appears to be evolving along with the agr locus rapidly with numerous recombinations which is unusual, as agr types are usually uniform in a cc.

st <dig> has not been reported from any of the asian countries till now. the mlst data base reports one isolate from australia and one from u.s. it appears important to determine if this clone will persist as a minor clone or not. st <dig> and st <dig> mrsa isolates carried the same composite type v sccmec elements unlike the ones carried by st <dig> isolates . among the numerous results obtained by the microarrays, collagen binding adhesion  was absent in st <dig> and present in  <dig> . the capsular polysaccharide types  <dig> and  <dig> were present in st <dig> and  <dig> respectively.

the large diversity in the sts present in the mssa isolates confirmed the highly diverse mssa population reported from shanghai, china, recently which included st <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> isolates along with others  <cit> . the probability of mssa conversion to mrsa is perhaps high in india with the over use of antibiotics and its spread due to inadequate hygienic practices.

high prevalence of pvl and egc among the indian mssa and mrsa isolates is unlike the situation in bangladesh, and indonesia where only mssa isolates contain pvl  <cit> . this indicates a possibility of pvl positive mssa acquiring sccmec elements to become pvl positive mrsa although this needs to be confirmed. a combination of pvlegc along with other entero-toxins could increase the severity of diseases caused by s. aureus although the role of pvl and other toxins is not completely elucidated  <cit> . there were no differences in the presence of the different virulence factors we characterized among the carrier isolates or the patient isolates.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper reports detailed molecular analysis of s. aureus isolates collected from different indian cities and environments with their virulence factors for the first time. we have identified new and emerging sts as mrsa in addition to already reported ones in healthy carriers as well as patients. there are variant types of type iv and v sccmec elements among mrsa. there is more diversity among the sts found in mssa which may have the potential to acquire methicillin resistance. majority of these isolates are pvl and egc positive. the detailed analysis of virulence factors might help in understanding of diseases caused and influence of host factors in those diseases.
