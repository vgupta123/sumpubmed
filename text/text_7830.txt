BACKGROUND
segmental duplications have been recognized as important mediators of both gene and genome evolution  <cit> . segmental duplications are substrates of genome innovation, genomic rearrangements, and hotspots of copy number variation  within species  <cit> . from the genic perspective, such duplications often encode protein products which, although not essential for viability of the organism, are important for the adaptation of the species to specific ecological niches  <cit> . among mammalian species, commonly duplicated genes include those associated with the recognition of environmental molecules and include genes associated with innate immunity, drug detoxification, olfaction, and sperm competition. from the perspective of genome structure, lineage-specific segmental duplications or large repeats often delineate regions of recurrent evolutionary liability  <cit> . recent comparative sequencing efforts among mammals, for example, shows that highly homologous repetitive sequence frequently associate with the breakpoints of large-scale chromosomal rearrangement  <cit> . understanding the nature and pattern of segmental duplications provides fundamental insight into functional redundancy, adaptive evolution, and the structural dynamics of chromosomal evolution  <cit> . from the practical perspective, regions of large-scale duplication are particularly problematic for genome assembly, snp mapping and genotyping  <cit> . for example, two independent bovine genome assemblies were recently reported  and a simple comparison indicated that significant fewer intrachromsomal duplications were detected in umd <dig>  <cit> . gene and snp annotation will significantly improve when duplicated sequence is correctly integrated into the assembly  <cit> . knowledge of the location and content of duplicated regions could be important for accurately mapping qtl, and validating putative single-nucleotide polymorphisms  that may have arisen from allelic variants as opposed to recently duplicated sequences <cit> .

segmental duplications have been extensively studied in other organisms  <cit> . here we report in detail our genome-wide and systematic analysis of segmental duplications in cattle using btau_ <dig> . we further validated the distribution of selected large duplications and briefly compared their corresponding regions in btau_ <dig>  to a second bovine assembly, umd <dig>  using fish. we performed a cross-mammalian survey of duplicated genes and gene families to compare gene repertoires and evolutionary mechanism of origin. along with rodents and carnivores, our bovine results now establish tandem duplications as the most likely mammalian archetypical organization, in contrast to higher primates which show a preponderance of interspersed duplications.

RESULTS
genome-wide identification of bovine segmental duplications
we applied two well-established computational approaches, whole genome shotgun sequence detection   <cit>  and whole genome assembly comparison   <cit> , to the publicly available bovine genome sequence assembly  to detect putative segmental duplications. briefly, wgac identifies paralogous sequences ≥  <dig> kb in length with ≥ 90% sequence identity, while the wssd identifies genomic regions that exhibit significant depth of coverage by aligning whole genome shotgun sequencing reads to the reference genome sequence . remarkably, we initially identified  <dig>  mb or  <dig>  pairwise alignments as putative duplications by the wgac analysis . of the  <dig>  intrachromosomal  segmental duplications, 71%  map within  <dig> mb of one another. as larger, high-identity duplications  are frequently collapsed within working draft sequence assemblies  <cit>  or may represent artificial duplications within an assembly  <cit> , we compared these wgac results to those detected by the assembly-independent wssd approach. we found that 44% of the wssd duplication intervals  were not detected by the genome assembly based comparison and, likely represent collapsed duplications . in addition, we identified  <dig>  mb high-confidence duplications detected by both methods. these include  <dig>  pairwise alignments .

we note the presence of a large fraction of sequence  detected by wgac  from the  <dig>  mb regions as defined above with no wssd overlap. excluding the unassigned scaffolds, these are predominantly intrachromosomal in origin and a total of 364/ <dig>  pairwise alignments map within  <dig> mb of one another. as large, high identity alleles  may not be merged and represent artificial duplications due to local assembly errors  <cit> , we excluded all these alignments to eliminate artificial duplications in batu_ <dig> . our results are also supported by the observation reported by zimin et al  <cit>  that overwhelming majority of the large, high-identity intrachromosomal duplications  are probably assembly artifacts. their brief duplication analysis indicated that batu_ <dig>  had significantly more duplications of this type,  <dig>  vs.  <dig> in umd <dig> 

following our previous studies of other genomes, we defined segmental duplications based on the union of all wgac hits with less than 94% sequence identity and wssd duplication intervals . we derived an estimate of the duplication content of the bovine genome to be  <dig> % . this, however, should be regarded as conservative estimate that will increase as the bovine genome assembly improves. in the following analyses, we focused on further characterization of this subset.

distribution and sequence properties of bovine segmental duplications
the recent segmental duplications of the bovine genome are distributed in a nonrandom fashion at two different levels. first, duplication content varies significantly among different chromosomes. chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and x show the greatest enrichment for segmental duplication  with twofold the duplication content of the genome average . most of this effect is due to an increase in intrachromosomal duplication content localized at specific clusters. furthermore, similar to the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes, there are a greater proportion of duplications near pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. excluding unmapped contigs, pericentromeric regions represent  <dig> % of genomic sequence, but show an enrichment of  <dig> -fold for duplications  and contain  <dig> % of all duplicated bases. similarly, subtelomeric regions show an enrichment of  <dig> -fold  and contain  <dig> % of duplicated bases. additionally, a strong positive correlation between segmental duplication and evolutionary breakpoint regions was observed  <cit> . as expected, the "uncharacterized chromosome" , which consists of sequence that cannot be uniquely mapped to the genome, contains the majority of predicted duplication bases .

of those duplications that can be assigned to a chromosome and confirmed by two different duplication algorithms, we note a bipartite distribution with respect to length and percent identity . fig.  <dig> depicts the duplication content of the bovine genome as a function of the length of alignment and the degree of sequence identity. interchromosomal duplications are shorter  and more divergent , while intrachromosomal duplications are much larger  showing higher sequence identity . there are  <dig>  duplication intervals from duplicated sequence identified by wgac and wssd with a median length and average length of  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb, respectively. twenty-one of these duplication blocks are ≥  <dig> kb in length and located in regions enriched in tandem duplications, including multiple known gene clusters . this pattern is reminiscent of the duplication pattern of other mammals  but differs from the interspersed segmental duplication pattern that predominates in human and great-ape genomes   <cit> .

delineation of the most recent duplication events at the genomic-sequence level, and particularly sequences located at their junctions  <cit> , may provide insight into their mechanism of origin  <cit> . we compared the repeat content of duplicated sequence, flanking sequence and the whole genome . unlike human segmental duplications, which are enriched for sine alu repeats  <cit> , no sine enrichment was associated with bovine segmental duplications. the working draft nature of the bovine genome sequence currently prevents a detailed analysis of the sequence structure at the transition regions between unique and duplicated sequence. nevertheless, two clear patterns emerge regarding repeat content. while ltr content remains similar, dna, sine and low-complexity repeat content of most duplications are reduced . sine content shows a reduction compared to the genome average . this gradually increases to the genome average as sequences flanking the duplications are considered. an opposite trend is observed with respect to line and satellite repeat sequences, even though the fold change for line is only  <dig>  . compared to the genome average, bovine segmental duplications show a  <dig> -fold enrichment for satellite repeat content and a  <dig> -fold elongation for satellite repeat average length . when individual repeat subfamilies are considered, two related satellite repeat classes btsat <dig> and ossat <dig> show the greatest increases in length and/or density while btsat <dig> and btsat <dig> show decreases in both length and density. satellite btsat <dig> shows  <dig> -fold increase in density while their average lengths are similar. satellite ossat <dig> shows  <dig> -fold increase in density and  <dig> -fold increase in length.

total
total
we compare the repeat content of duplicated regions as detected by both wssd and wgac ; 20-kb flanking regions immediately flanking the clustered duplications and the genome average. enrichment ratios were defined as the total repeat length, count/ <dig> mb and average length of duplicated sequence divided by the repeat length, count/ <dig> mb and average length of genome. the significance of the enrichment was determined by simulating the repeats in a random sample  of cattle duplicated genomic sequence .

gene content
we considered the genomic duplication content of the gene sets aligned to the bovine genome. seventy-six percent  of the bovine segmental duplication intervals identified by both wgac and wssd correspond to complete or partial gene duplications . of these, the overwhelming majority of pairwise alignments was <  <dig> mb apart, again indicating that most "functional" duplicates within the bovine genome are clusters of tandem gene families, as opposed to widely interspersed duplications in humans and other primates. although a portion of these intervals correspond to predicted genes of unknown or hypothetical function,  <dig>  refseq genes were located in predicted segmental duplications. in order to test the hypothesis that particular gene classes are overrepresented in duplicated regions, we assigned panther molecular function terms to all genes that overlapped duplications. statistically significant over or under representations were observed for multiple categories . another independent gene ontology and pathway analyses also confirm that these terms and categories are significantly enriched in bovine segmental duplication regions  <cit> .

consistent with similar duplication analyses in other mammals  <cit> , several of these gene duplications, which are important in drug detoxification, defense/innate immunity and receptor and signal recognition, are also duplicated in cattle . since these genes or gene families have been repeatedly detected to be duplicated in multiple mammalian genomes, it will be interesting to investigate their repertoires and evolutionary mechanisms. combining the bovine gene annotation effort  <cit> , our duplication analyses and other published results, we surveyed and summarized the evolutionary analyses of  <dig> well-studied duplicated gene families in cattle, humans, mice and dogs . these multiple-member gene families normally went through the so-called "birth-and-death" evolution  <cit>  in which new genes were created by gene duplication and some of them were retained in the genome for a long time as functional genes, but other genes were inactivated or eliminated from the genome. while some ancient members arose before the last common ancestor of mammals, a common theme is that new members often originated after divergence of these mammals from each other. these lineage-specific gene expansions of individual subfamilies were detected in all  <dig> species, especially in cattle and mice.

as many of these duplicated genes are present in unassigned chromosomes, gene numbers in the bovine genome are based on the cited literature and some of them are just best estimates. *based on searches on the international immunogenetics  information system at http://www.imgt.org/.

depending on their nature , three major evolutionary mechanisms - gene duplication, positive selection and conversion have shaped these gene families to different degrees. for example, phylogenetic analysis of rnase a indicates that this gene family expansion predated the separation of placental and marsupial mammals and that differential gene duplication and loss occurred in different species, generating a great variation in gene number and content among extant mammals  <cit> . similarly, gene duplication and inactivation have important roles in both the adaptive and non-adaptive evolution of olfactory receptor  genes  <cit> . another example is β-defensin genes which are densely clustered in four to five syntenic chromosomal regions. although the majority of β-defensins are evolutionarily conserved across species, subgroups of gene lineages exist that are specific in species like cattle and mice and originated recently by gene duplication and positive selection  <cit> . an analysis of cytochrome p <dig> gene families in  <dig> vertebrate species provided two distinct evolutionary schemes depending on gene functions. while stable genes for endogenous metabolic functions are characterized by few or no gene duplications or deletions, unstable genes for xenobiotics detoxification are characterized by frequent gene duplications, deletions and positive selection  <cit> . finally, gene conversion has played a major role in shaping the ifna gene family in eutherian species after gene duplication  <cit> . the other duplication examples include tcrv  <cit> , c-type lysozymes  <cit> , bpi-like   <cit> , bpi/lbp, cathelicidin  <cit> , interferon subfamilies   <cit> , pregnancy-associated glycoprotein  <cit> , sulfotransferases, ulbp  <cit> , wc <dig>  <cit>  and etc.

the high level of sequence identity  indicates that over 25%  of the bovine duplications may have occurred within the artiodactyla, and probably more specifically within the bos lineage. for example, some genes are only duplicated in cattle but not in other mammalian lineages . additionally, some of these may represent gene families important in cattle adaptation or recent domestication. there are also considerable gene duplications involved in adaptive immune responses in cattle compared with human and mouse. for example, we detected  <dig> duplication blocks containing at least  <dig> wc <dig> genes distributed within two distant regions on chr <dig> . we find evidence of recent duplication of the intelectin gene , which is a receptor for a major iron-binding protein in milk, and a sterol carrier protein , which is an intracellular protein potentially involved in lipid transfer in organs involved in lipid metabolism, including mammary tissue. two other genes encoding proteins present in milk during lactation or mastitis were found to be associated with segmental duplications: cathelicidin  and β- <dig> microglobulin . in addition, there is over-representation of genes involved in ruminant-specific aspects of reproduction including the intercellular signaling proteins pregnancy associated glycoproteins , interferon tau , trophoblast kunitz domain proteins  and prolactin-related proteins . our predictions and fish results also confirmed that the expansion of the well-known c-type lysozyme family though gene duplication .

fish characterization of predicted segmental duplication and comparison of bovine genome assemblies
we experimentally validated a subset of the largest  duplicated regions by fish . forty-six large-insert bac clones identified by wgac and/or wssd methods were used as probes and hybridized against a hereford smooth muscle cell line . one bac clone  was only supported by wgac < 94% . six of the probes failed to generate signals by hybridization. we observed multiple signals either by examination of interphase and metaphase fish for 80%  of the remaining probes confirming their duplication status including duplications of cattle genes of alas <dig>  bcas <dig>  gemin <dig>  ldb <dig>  med <dig>  nmt <dig>  and zfp <dig>  as expected, the majority  of the wssd intervals without assembly support for duplications  were confirmed by fish. only  <dig> of the probes showed signals on non-homologous chromosomes . 93% of the probes  showed evidence of duplicated signals that were locally clustered .  <dig> out of  <dig> duplicated bacs produced pericetromeirc or telomeric signals. the bac probes  covering lyz <dig> produced duplicated signals both interchomosomally and intrachomosomally . similar to the mouse and dog genomes  <cit> , these fish data demonstrate that tandem intrachromosomal duplications predominate in the cattle genome . the basis for the remaining  <dig> bac probes consistent with single copy sequence is unknown. we note, however, that the animal for the cell line used in the fish experiments is a hereford male different from the sequenced cow , and copy number polymorphism as well as limitations of bac-fish to detect duplications <  <dig> kb  may account for differences between the computational predictions and experimental data.

a set of  <dig> large-insert bac clones from chori- <dig> library were selected and independent fish hybridizations were performed. one bac clone was only supported by wgac < 94%. fish signals were categorized as "single", "dup intra" or "dup inter" based on the presence of a single signal or multiple signals on the same or different chromosomes for each probe. *it does not include 154h <dig>  which was scored as both dup inter and dup intra.

*na: not assigned. one bac clones  was only supported by wgac < 94%.

as local assembly errors, e.g. artificial duplications, are particularly enriched in large, high-identity duplicated regions identified only by wgac , we chose  <dig> additional bac clones from that region  as fish probes to compare btau_ <dig>  and umd <dig>  since the bac-fish method used here was most reliable to distinguish single signal vs. duplicated signals and interchromosomal  vs. intrachromosomal  duplications, our assembly comparisons were mainly based on these two criteria. table  <dig> summaries our comparisons of the fish results with the computational predications based on btau_ <dig>  or umd <dig>  except for one bac clone  which had no results,  <dig> bac clones supported umd2's predictions while only  <dig> supported btau_ <dig> 's. this result is a striking contrast to what we obtained for those  <dig> bac clones of both, wssd and wgac < 94% types . the two assemblies essentially produced the same computational predictions for those  <dig> bac clones , suggesting two assemblies are almost identical in those high-confidence duplicated regions.

*na: not assigned. we implemented three-letter codes to represent signal patterns detected by fish or predicted based on btau_ <dig>  and umd <dig>  this is due to the fact that the bac-fish method was most reliable to distinguish single signal , signals from intrachromosomal  or interchromosomal  duplications. "y" means there is while "n" means there is no corresponding signal type. one bac clone  had no fish results.

discussion
we present the first detailed genome-wide analysis of recent segmental duplication content of the bovine genome. global studies of segmental duplication content have become an effective measure to assess one aspect of the quality of whole-genome sequence assemblies  <cit> . regions of recent segmental duplication remain one of the greatest challenges to finishing a genome assembly. the underlying problem is the same--the correct placement and resolution of large sequence that can be assigned to multiple positions within the genome. an initial assessment of bovine segmental duplication content therefore provides an important level of annotation for the user of genome sequence information in the design and interpretation of future experiments. moreover, these initial analyses precisely delineate potential regions where whole-genome shotgun or a bac-enrichment strategy will provide insufficient information for biologists. these regions include gene families important in immunity, digestion, lactation and reproduction traits. the content and structure of these regions will be pivotal to animal evaluation and selection. we therefore propose that such highly duplicated regions be uncoupled from wgs sequencing strategies and be targeted for high-quality bac-based finishing to resolving their true location, organization, and complexity. the results presented here should provide a framework for the prioritization of such regions.

the detection of recent segmental duplications is sensitive to the quality of the underlying sequence assembly. at least four factors directly impact an assessment of the segmental duplication content within any genome assembly:  the depth of sequencing ,  the methodology of assembly,  the quality of common repeat annotation, and  level of allelic variation. all of these factors must be taken into account during an assessment of recent segmental duplication content. there are some limitations of this analysis that should be noted. although many of the expected bovine gene duplications and highly homologous gene families  were validated during our analysis, not all were detected. it is clear that duplications have been problematic during sequence and assembly. the analysis of the unplaced chromosome sequence provides the best testament to this effect. the "unplaced" chromosome  in btau_ <dig>  showed a marked enrichment for blocks of segmental duplication, with almost half  of the duplications assigned to this category.

despite these methodological and assembly limitations, some important trends regarding bovine segmental duplications emerged during our study. our bovine segmental duplication estimate is consistent with similar observations in rat  <cit>  and dog  <cit>  but lower than human, mouse  <cit> . while these differences may be biologically, we suspect that differences in the strategy for genome sequencing and assembly are the most likely cause. the human and mouse genome assemblies are in the "finished" phases combining both clone-based and whole-genome shotgun strategies  <cit> . the duplicated regions represented a major focus in finishing these efforts resulting in a general increase in the amount of duplications as seen in fig.  <dig>  even when more relaxed cutoffs  were applied to the dog and bovine genomes. this is because that like rat, the bovine genome is in still in draft version assembled using a hybrid strategy, termed "bac-enrichment." the bac-enrichment hybrid strategy entailed low-pass sequencing of individual bac clones, followed by an enrichment phase where individual wgs reads were mapped to specific bac projects based on sequence overlap  <cit> . this may also help to explain the unusually large number of unsupported  duplications.

our combined experimental and computational results demonstrated that cattle, as a representative of ruminants, is the fourth species whose pattern is reminiscent of the duplication pattern of other mammals . along with rodents and carnivores, these results now confidently establish tandem duplications as the most likely mammalian archetypical organization, in contrast to humans and great ape species which show a preponderance of interspersed duplications. based on the current btau_ <dig>  assembly, bovine recent duplications are distributed in a nonuniform fashion across the genome. in addition to chromosomal differences, we identified  <dig> duplication blocks  over  <dig> kb in length. the majority of bovine duplications are organized as clusters of tandem or inverted intrachromosomal duplications. a similar bias toward clustered duplications was observed in the mouse, rat and dog genome assemblies   <cit> . the molecular basis for this difference in hominoid and other genomes is unknown, although the burst of primate alu retroposition activity ~ <dig> million years ago has been suggested to correlate with the expansion and dispersion of human segmental duplications  <cit> . our analyses of the bovine genome also clearly shows a pericentromeric and subtelomeric bias for segmental duplications, indicating that these may be general properties of mammalian chromosomal architecture. an analysis of the evolutionary genetic distance of all segmental duplications as a function of the sum of aligned base pairs  showed a bipartite distribution, for intrachromosomal and interchromosomal segmental duplications. two peaks were observed, at  <dig>  substitutions per site  and  <dig>  substitutions per site . assuming a neutral sequence divergence range of  <dig> - <dig>  × 10- <dig> substitution/site/year  <cit> , this bipartite distribution may correspond to segmental duplication expansions that occurred relatively recently .

sequence analysis between sheep and cattle genes indicated that their divergences ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> % at non-synonymous sites and between  <dig>  and  <dig> % at synonymous sites  <cit> . our assessment of the underlying genes reinforces the now relatively commonplace enrichment of specific ontological classes but also identifies lineage-specific genes  potentially important for promoting cattle speciation, adaptation and domestication. at the gene level, for those duplicated genes or gene families in these mammals, both mutation  and selection  are implied in lineage-specific adaptations of these mammals to a particular environment. duplication of genes involved immunity may be particularly important to cattle due to the substantial load of microorganisms present in the rumen of cattle, an increased risk of opportunistic infections at mucosal surfaces and the need for a stronger and more diversified innate immune responses at these locations. for example, wc <dig> genes encode a family of scavenger receptor cysteine-rich  proteins found exclusively on γδ t cells in cattle, sheep and swine but not humans or mice  <cit> . in addition, we found evidence of recent duplication of itln <dig> and scp <dig>  which may be involved in iron and lipid transfer in milk. additional copy of b2m in the cattle genome may impact on the abundance of igg in cow's milk and increase capacity for uptake in the neonatal gut. previous studies have demonstrated that the lysozyme family has gone through lineage-specific gene amplifications and sequence adaptations to digestion in ruminants including cattle  <cit> . lysozyme gene duplications were correctly predicted by both in silico approaches and independently confirmed by fish. although inter- and intrachromosomal fish signals of 154h <dig> suggest that that genomic region may be more complex than we currently appreciate, additional sequence analysis and est expression data provide further support for our observation  <cit> . this evidence strongly demonstrated that the expansion of the lysozyme gene family is likely essential for both increasing the expression of lysozyme and allowing it to adapt to different functions  and/or regions  of the ruminant digestive system. it is interesting to note that many of the duplicated genes involved in immunity have been adapted to non-immune functions in cattle: e.g. ifnt, which is involved in maintaining early pregnancy, and the lysozyme genes, which are involved in digestion  <cit> , agreeing with the "birth-and-death' theory.

cytogenetics using bac-fish can independently test and compare two genome assemblies  <cit> . as our current fish results were limited and only based on a single hereford individual, further analysis will be needed to confirm our observations. this could include performing the same fish experiments in additional unrelated individuals, additional cattle breeds  and subspecies , and closely related species like bison, water buffalo and yak. these experiments will help to clarify the effects of inter-individual cnv on our fish validation. although copy numbers could not be accurately defined, there were several signs of cnv events in our fish experiments . it will be also interesting to detect the breed-specific genomic signatures, if any exist, emerged from the intense cattle selection.

even though our fish results were not completely definitive, they provided the first preliminary experimental evidence to evaluate the two available bovine genome assemblies, especially in the duplicated regions which are difficult or challenging to assemble. our results are more consistent with zimin et al, who reported that significant fewer intrachromosomal duplications  were detected in umd <dig>  however, neither of these two assemblies is perfect in terms of totally agreeing with the fish results, suggesting a room for further assembly improvement. another crucial point is that although umd <dig> is different from btau_ <dig>  and significantly improved in large, high-identity duplicated regions identified only by wgac, our definition of bovine segmental duplication  is essentially assembly independent. this is because our computational approaches  can effectively detect these local assembly errors and exclude them from subsequent analyses as false positives. in this sense, it is reasonable to believe that if our approaches were applied to umd <dig>  they would produce a similar estimate of the duplication content. beyond the  <dig> % segmental duplication regions, there are other types of differences between these two assemblies, such as deletions, inversions and translocations. a systematic genome-wide fish comparison of these two assemblies is beyond the scope of this study but definitely warranted for the future study.

additional note
after the completion of this study, a new version of cattle genome assembly umd <dig> was made available at ftp://ftp.cbcb.umd.edu/pub/data/bos_taurus/. similar in silico analyses were also performed on umd <dig> for all bacs in tables  <dig> and  <dig>  yielding essentially the same results as the analyses reported on umd <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides insights into the bovine genome evolution and generates a valuable resource for cattle genomics research. we provide a roadmap for improving the quality of specific regions of the cattle genome that will require special care to resolve the copy, content and structure. duplicated regions will be an important complement to snp centric genome-wide association studies since snp discovery and genotyping have been biased against such regions. characterizing the impact of copy-number and single basepair variation for genes embedded within these regions will be a challenging, next step. such variation will likely be important in considering the genetic basis of domestication traits and their selection among diverse cattle breeds.
