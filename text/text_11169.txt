BACKGROUND
prolactin  is a  <dig> kda hormone that stimulates the growth and differentiation of mammary epithelium, and initiates and maintains lactation  <cit> . prl serum levels range from 5– <dig> ng/ml in blood in non-pregnant humans and up to  <dig> ng/ml in pregnant females. the lactogenic actions of prl are mediated by binding to its receptor , an event that activates several proximal prlr signaling cascades including jak2-stat <dig>  <cit> . prl-induced autophosphorylation of jak <dig> results in the activation of this tyrosine kinase, and its subsequent phosphorylation of both the prlr and the prlr-associated, latent transcription factor stat <dig>  following phosphorylation, stat <dig> is released from the prlr, self-dimerizes and is translocated into the nucleus  <cit> , where it binds to gene promoter sequences containing stat5-binding elements, resulting in the induction of gene expression such as cytokine inducible sh2-containing protein , β-casein, c-myc, and cyclin d <dig>  <cit> .

the jak2/stat <dig> pathway is negatively regulated by a feedback loop through the suppressors of cytokine signaling  <cit> , a family of related proteins that includes cish. the induction of cish gene expression results in the binding of cish to the phosphorylated prlr, which in turn prevents the subsequent binding of stat <dig> to prlr, hence attenuating the prl/stat <dig> signaling pathway  <cit> . interestingly, while blocking stat <dig> activation cish does not stop continued jak <dig> and mapk activity. this observation, coupled with the detection of elevated expression of cish protein in primary human breast cancers, has led to the hypothesis that prl-induced cish expression may facilitate the pathogenesis of breast cancer by enhancing cell proliferation triggered by jak2/mapk activity at the expense of cell differentiation mediated by stat <dig>  <cit> .

luciferase-reporter assays are widely used to monitor the cellular events related to transduction and gene expression regulated by specific signaling cascades, such as prl/jak2/stat <dig> pathway. there are several reporter construct used to study stat <dig> activity, such as the lhre-tk-luc  <cit> , cyclin d1Δ- <dig>  <cit> , β-casein- <dig>  <cit> , and β-casein- <dig>  <cit> . however, in breast cancer cells these existing reporter constructs have proven to be relatively insensitive to the effects of prl, requiring supra-physiologic concentrations of prl  to detect reporter induction. to generate a more prl-sensitive reporter construct, our analysis of the literature suggested that the prl-responsive cish promoter could be an optimal candidate as it contains four stat <dig> binding sites, and is rapidly activated after prl stimulation  <cit> . cloning of the promoter region of the cish gene into the improved pgl <dig>  luciferase reporter construct resulted in a highly sensitive, prl-responsive reporter that should be of widespread utility in examining prl/stat <dig> pathway in er+ human breast cancer cells.

methods
cell lines, reagents and vectors
the breast cancer cell lines t47d, mcf <dig>  bt- <dig>  mda- <dig> and the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line mcf10a from american type culture collection  were maintained in dulbecco's modified eagle's medium  or the similar growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum  and penicillin/streptomycin  in a humidified atmosphere of 5% co <dig> at 37°c. human recombinant prolactin was obtained from dr. michael hodsdon   <cit> . transfection reagents fugene hd  for mcf <dig> cells and lipofactamine  <dig>  for all other cell lines were used for transfection. vectors renilla luciferase reporter pgl <dig>  , pgl <dig>  , pgl4-cish , pef-prlr  <cit> , and pef v5/his a  were used for transfection.

reporter construction
the cish promoter region  was pcr amplified using the primers olg <dig> 5'ccgccc caacctctatca-3' and olg <dig> 5'-ggccaagcttactgagaggcagtggcg cggaccgcc-3'  using hifi pcr kit . for the vector, a promoter-less pgl <dig> luciferase expression construct  was utilized. the ecorv and hindiii digested pgl <dig>  reporter and the hindiii digested pcr product were ligated and transformed into top <dig> e coli cells. the construct was confirmed by sequencing using primer olg <dig>  and rvprimer  <dig> . the generated reporter was termed pgl4-cish. the cyclin d <dig> promoter region was pcr amplified using the olg <dig>  and olg <dig> . the kpni and hindiii digested pcr product and pgl <dig>  reporter backbone were ligated and the construct was named as pgl4-ccnd <dig> 

transfection and dual luciferase assay
t47d cells were plated in a 24-well plate and grown at 60% confluency for transfection. for luciferase assays,  <dig> ng of a given reporter construct,  <dig>  ng of renilla  and/or  <dig> ng of pcmv-wtstat5a per well were used for transfection. after transfection, cells were maintained in  <dig> ul of growth media overnight, and then arrested in  <dig> ul of serum-free, phenol red-free dmem for  <dig> hours followed by prl treatment for  <dig> hours. after treatment, cells were lysed in  <dig> ul of  <dig> × passive lysis buffer  at room temperature for  <dig> minutes. for dual luciferase assay,  <dig> ul of lysate was aliquoted into a 96-well plate and subjected to analysis of firefly luciferase  and renilla . luminescence was read on victor <dig>  <dig> multilabel counter . all analyses were performed in duplicate, with each experiments performed at least twice.

western blot
forty microliters of cell lysates from luciferase assay were loaded onto 10% sds-page gel. proteins were transferred onto pvdf membrane and western blots were performed using 50% skim milk . antibodies anti-stat5a , anti-prlr  and anti-gapdh  were used for western blot analysis. images were obtained using a fujifilm las- <dig> image analyzer.

RESULTS
at present, there are several reporters available for the study of the stat <dig> signaling pathway, that includes a synthetic reporter with six-tandem stat <dig> responsive elements , as well as reporter constructs containing the promoter regions from prl-responsive genes, namely two cyclin d <dig> promoter-derived sequences , and the rat β-casein promoter sequences  . all of these reporters commonly carry one or more stat <dig> responsive elements and have been widely used to study the prl-induced activation of stat <dig> pathway . however as noted above, they are relatively insensitive to the effect of prl.



cish is a repressor through a negative feedback mechanism in the jak2/stat <dig> pathway  <cit> . a web-based software  was used to search for stat <dig> binding sites in the cish promoter region, and found four stat <dig> binding sites in the proximal region . in order to evaluate the response of the human cish promoter in the context of the stat5/jak <dig> signaling pathway, a  <dig> bp fragment  was cloned into upstream of a luciferase reporter gene in the promoterless pgl <dig>  reporter, resulting in a novel reporter construct termed as pgl4-cish. initial use of this reporter in t47d cells revealed that the construct was highly responsive to prl.

to evaluate the luciferase signal strength as a function of the quantity of transfected pgl4-cish reporter, varying concentrations of the pgl4-cish reporter dna  were transfected into t47d cells. these studies revealed that  <dig> ng of pgl4-cish dna resulted in a ~50% maximal luminescence signal intensity in the presence of prl . to further optimize the pgl4-cish reporter assay, the response of this construct to different concentrations of prl was tested. results indicated that pgl4-cish was induced 2-fold with  <dig> ng/ml of prl, 8-fold with  <dig> ng/ml of prl, saturating at  <dig> ng/ml of prl . additional time course analysis revealed a relatively rapid 4-fold induction of the pgl4-cish reporter after as short as  <dig> hours of prl treatment .

the response of the pgl4-cish in human breast epithelial lines was assessed by its transection into a panel of er+ and er- cell lines. the er+ breast cancer cell lines t47d, mcf <dig>  the er- mda- <dig>  bt- <dig> and the non-tumorigenic epithelial cell line mcf10a were chosen for varying levels of prlr expression   <cit> . results showed that robust expression of pgl4-cish was obtained in t47d transfectants . in mcf <dig> transfectants, pgl4-cish was increased  <dig>  fold following prl stimulation. no significant increase in expression from the pgl4-cish reporter was noted following prl stimulation in the mcf10a, mda <dig> or bt <dig> cell lines . as the responsiveness of the pgl4-cish reporter may be related to prlr expression, the response of this reporter in mcf <dig> transfectants overexpressing the human prlr was tested. overexpression of prlr enhanced the prl-induced response of pgl4-cish in mcf <dig> cells , suggesting that prlr levels contributed to the responsiveness of the pgl4-cish expression in mcf <dig> cells.

to assess the sensitivity of pgl4-cish reporter in t47d cells, in contrast to other commonly utilized prl-responsive expression constructs such as lhre-tk-luc, cyclin d1Δ- <dig>  pgl4-ccnd <dig> and β-casein- <dig> reporters, direct comparisons of prl-induced luminescence of t47d transfectants were performed. as shown in fig 4a, pgl4-cish had the highest basal luciferase activity  compared to lhre-tk-luc , beta-casein- <dig> , pgl4-ccnd <dig>  and cyclin d1Δ- <dig>  . despite this higher level of basal luciferase activity seen with pgl4-cish, the overall prl-induced expression from the pgl4-cish reporter was markedly increased over the other reporter constructs evaluated. the pgl4-cish luciferase activity was robustly induced by 19-fold following prl stimulation, while all of the other reporter only constructs showed a 2– <dig> fold increase in luciferase expression at high physiologic concentration of prl . the effect of increased stat5a levels on reporter responsiveness was also tested. results showed that the overexpression of stat5a also enhanced prl induction of luciferase activity in all the tested reporters, with pgl4-cish showing the highest responsiveness . the dose responsiveness of stat5a on pgl4-cish was also tested. as shown in figure 4d, increasing expression of stat5a did not alter the reporter basal activity in the absence of prl. however, in the presence of prl, pgl4-cish luciferase activity increased as a function of quantity of transfected stat5a . taken together, our data indicate that the responsiveness of the pgl4-cish reporter is sensitive to both prlr and stat5a expression levels.

discussion
the versatility and simplicity of the reporter assay is a powerful tool in the fields of biological and pharmaceutical research  <cit> , and there is an ongoing need for highly responsive reporters  <cit> . until recently, older reporter vector backbones had spurious transcription factor binding sites resulting in both inaccurate and false-positive results. for the studies presented here, a new pgl <dig> reporter with decreased cryptic dna regulatory elements and transcription factor binding sites was used as a backbone for reporter. we constructed a novel pgl4-cish reporter based on the pgl <dig> backbone and the stat5-response-rich-element cish promoter. the pgl4-cish dna dose curve, prl dose curve and time course parameters were optimized for this reporter. our results indicated that this reporter had a high sensitivity to prl in t47d, less so in mcf <dig>  and little to none in er- cell lines evaluated. as subsequently shown with mcf <dig> cells, our data would indicate that both prlr and stat5a levels contribute to the responsiveness of the pgl4-cish reporter.

cell proliferation, as measured by 3h-thymidine incorporation, is a sensitive and simple way to test prl action  <cit> . in the t47d proliferation assay, maximal stimulation  was achieved with  <dig> ng/ml of prl treatment  <cit> . in our study, pgl4-cish reporter demonstrated a 2-fold induction upon  <dig> ng/ml of prl treatment, suggesting this reporter was significantly more sensitive than the thymidine-incorporated proliferation assay to detect breast cancer cell responsiveness to prl stimulation.

the luciferase induction of pgl4-cish, lhre-tk-luc, cyclin d1Δ- <dig>  pgl4-ccnd <dig> and beta-casein <dig> reporters was also compared in t47d cells. results indicated that pgl4-cish reporter was the most responsive to prl treatment in t47d cells. a reporter termed -404cis-luc containing about  <dig> bp of human cish promoter has also been reported  <cit> . however, this reporter demonstrated poor prl-induced expression in cos <dig> cells  <cit> . we reason the different response to prl of reporters is due to the limited proximal promoter regions utilized, the different backbones used for reporter construct, and cells lines used for reporter assay.

prl activates the latent cytoplasmic stat <dig> by tyrosine phosphorylation and dimerization in prl/jak2/stat <dig> pathway  <cit> . the intranuclear phospho-stat <dig> then activates the stat5-responsive-gene expression. we observed that in the absence of prl, overexpression of stat5a does not stimulate pgl4-cish luciferase. in the presence of prl, overexpression of stat <dig> greatly enhanced the effect of prl on pgl4-cish reporter . these data indicate that the activation of pgl4-cish is influenced by the level of available stat5a following prl treatment.

the pgl4-cish reporter has potential applications in the analysis of the prl/stat <dig> pathway, cish promoter analysis, and biological screening for drug discovery. indeed, as a novel bioassay for prl, the pgl4-cish reporter has a sensitivity approaching that of the venerable rat nb <dig> lymphoma cell bioassay for prl. as a distinct advantage, the pgl4-cish system now provides a sensitive, species homologous assay for the action of human prl in human cell lines expressing sufficient levels of prlr and stat <dig>  the cish promoter has four stat <dig> binding sites but also include other potential transcriptional binding sites such as sp <dig>  hsf, c-myb, and gata- <dig>  detailed functional mapping of this promoter to characterize the relative contributions of cis-acting elements will improve our understanding of how prl signaling triggers the response of the cish at the transcriptional level.

CONCLUSIONS
given its sensitivity to prl, the pgl4-cish reporter should be a useful tool in the screening of small compound libraries in the identification of novel prl/stat <dig> inhibitors.
