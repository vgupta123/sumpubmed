BACKGROUND
pseudogymnoascus spp. is a group of fungi species which phylogenetically belongs to the phylum ascomycota, family pseudeurotiaceae. many of the p. spp. including p. destructants were known as geomyces spp. until reclassification based on phylogenetic analysis conducted in  <cit> . species boundaries in pseudogymnoascus still remain uncertain  <cit>  recalling an overall problem in fungal taxonomy  <cit> . p. spp were long time believed to be anamorphic based on the absence of the evidence of sexual reproduction  <cit> , p. destructants was shown to spread clonaly in north america  <cit> . however, several homothallic lineages of p. spp were shown to produce ascospores in culture  <cit> , while p. destructants was proposed to have a heterothallic sexual reproduction pathway.

morphology of p. spp. varies dramatically dependent on the growing conditions  <cit> . p. spp. are widespread in soils and can be found almost everywhere from arctica to antarctica  <cit> . p. spp. can tolerate low temperatures and high salinity, although they are not truly psychrophilic or halophilic  <cit> . p. spp. can degrade keratin and cause skin infections  <cit> , and p. destructans causes white nose syndrome in bats  <cit> .

strictly asexual reproduction should result in clonal structure of population. however, sex is often hard to detect in experimental studies on ascyomycota species  <cit> . also many ascomycota species are capable of parasexual process, which consists of fusion of cells followed by chromosome loss which eventually restores the normal caryotype, but does not involve meiosis. parasexual process is often accompanied by recombination, although its rate is lower than that of meiotic recombination and it affects only short chromosome segments  <cit> . horizontal gene transfer  can also occur in fungi. the most common type of hgt involves homologous recombination between genome sequences  <cit> . although most of the cases reported so far involve hgt between different species  <cit> , one can expect that within-population hgt which involves homologous recombination is even more common  <cit> . thus, even if p. spp. truly lack meiosis, there still could be some genetic exchanges between strains in its populations.

whole-genome analysis of p. spp. enables us to investigate such recombination events and detect genes associated with recombination activity. it also reveals relation between strains extracted from permafrost and temperate environments, which are considered isolated. here, we report data on the genetic structure of p. spp. strains.

RESULTS
genome assembly, annotation, and key characteristics of p. spp. genomes
we performed whole-genome sequencing and analysis of  <dig> p. spp. strains.

these strains were collected from different habitats: temperate environment and arctic active layers , permafrost  and cryopeg, a layer of unfrozen ground in permafrost, , and from different geographic locations . none of the strains was seen to produce ascospores. sequencing was performed on hiseq <dig> machine using paired-end libraries with average insert size ~350 nt. the sequenced reads were assembled, independently for each individual, with soapdenovo . assembly statistics for each strains are listed in table  <dig>  whole-genome alignments of the assembled genotypes was created with lastz and clustal . mapping reads to their assembly reveals that all studied p. spp. isolates are haploid.table  <dig>

annotation of genomes of the sequenced strains was performed with augustus  <cit>  v. <dig> . number of annotated genes within a genome varies from  <dig> to  <dig> . the vast majority of genes is present in all or almost all assemblies , e.g. out of  <dig> genes in strain vkm f- <dig>   <dig> genes were identified in at least  <dig> other assemblies and  <dig> were not found in any other assembly. using cegma pipeline  <cit> , we demonstrated that for all p. spp. strains except f- <dig>  ≥90% of low-copy core eukaryotic genes are fully present in the assembly . considerable variation of the number of annotated genes among genomes could be due to difference in assembly quality. however, separate analysis of genes pseudogenized or deleted on specific branches of the phylogenetic tree indicates asymmetric loss of genes among p. spp. strains . strains f- <dig>  f- <dig>  and f- <dig> have the lowest numbers of genes and the highest rates of gene loss , whereas strains f- <dig> and f- <dig> have the highest number of genes and the lowest rates of gene loss  . overall we detected  <dig> lost genes .table  <dig>

the gc-content varies from  <dig> % to  <dig> %  among the sequenced strains, with the average  <dig> %. more than half of the genome consists of protein-coding genes. the total length of genes varies from  <dig>  mb to  <dig>  mb among the strains, and the total length of intergenic regions varies within a wider range from  <dig>  mb to <dig>  mb. average gene lengths are 1438–1828 bp, average numbers of introns per gene are  <dig> – <dig> , average intron lengths are 102–111 bp, median intron length is 58–60 bp .

we also compared sequences obtained in our study to sequences of p. spp. obtained previously in other studies. genotype sequence of strain f- <dig> is very similar  to genotype sequence of p. spp. strain sequenced in  <cit> . we also combined our data with  <cit>   and attributed our strains to different clades of p. spp. obtained in that study . our strains correspond to  <dig> different clades of p. spp. from  <cit> .

relationships between  <dig> p. spp. genotypes
comparison of the genomes of p. spp. strains reveals their very high nucleotide diversity. a typical genetic distance between two sequences at synonymous sites, ds, is ~ <dig> , although some strains form compact clades  and are much closer to each other. for strains from different clades, a typical distance at nonsynonymous sites dn is ~ <dig>  . synteny between all genomes is extensive, and even within the most distant genome pairs over 90% of orthologous gene pairs are followed by another pair of orthologous genes . there are no traces of either geographical or geological structure of the global population of p. spp. in the phylogenetic relationships among the analyzed genomes. thus, these structures, if they exist, must be much younger than divergence of the ancestral lineages of these genomes.figure  <dig> genome synteny across p. spp. strains. each square corresponds to fraction of adjacent gene pairs in strain from vertical row with orthrologs in strain from horizontal row, which are also adjacent in strain from horizontal row.



topology of the phylogeny shown on figure  <dig> holds throughout almost the entire genome. only  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %, and  <dig> % of whole genome alignments do not support the  <dig> clades, , , , , and , respectively . this implies that regular recombination does not take place between the p. spp. strains and supports the observations of primarily asexual reproduction in p. spp. clade , the only clade with more than two strains, demonstrates a strong linkage disequilibrium among genotypes from the same clade . no linkage disequilibrium was observed at distances over  <dig> nucleotides for genotypes from different clades  , which is likely due to homoplasy between highly diverged  sequences and little time intervals between lineage splits. strains vkm f- <dig>  vkm f- <dig>  vkm f- <dig> were used to demonstrate relations between distant clades, however the results are similar to that observed on figure 3bc for any combination of distant strains.table  <dig> number of sites according or conflicting with a clade

search for meiotic genes and mating pathway genes
we searched for the genes orthologous to those which are responsible for meiosis or mating in s. cerevisiae. in p. spp. genomes we found orthologs for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes involved in different steps of meiosis in s. cerevisiae , implying that  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes were lost in p. spp..  <dig> out of  <dig> lost genes are involved in early phases of meiosis in s. cerevisiae: ime <dig> and rec <dig> are meiosis-inducing protein  <cit> , mum <dig> is required for premeiotic dna synthesis  <cit> , red <dig> is required for segregation of chromosomes in meiosis i  <cit> , zip <dig>  zip <dig>  zip <dig> and zip <dig> are required for initiation of chromosome synapsis  <cit> ; the rest  <dig> of these genes, dit <dig>  isc <dig> and mum <dig> are involved in sporulation in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .table  <dig>

in contrast to meiotic genes we observed only  <dig> lost gene out of  <dig> which are responsible for mating in s. cerevisiae , notably all ste genes responsible for mating factor sensitivity in s. cerevisiae are also present in p. spp. strains  <cit> . a putative mating-type  locus with highly-conserved apn <dig> and sla <dig> genes was also found in p. spp. .figure  <dig> genetic structure of the mat-locus and its flanking regions in p. spp.
 mat- <dig> configuration consists of mat1-1- <dig> hmg transcription factor, an unknown gene mat1-1- <dig>  and mat1-1- <dig> α-box transcription factor. the part of the mat- <dig> locus which corresponds to region with noncanonical phylogeny is marked with red bar.  mat- <dig> configuration consists of mat1-2- <dig> hmg-box transcription factor and an unknown gene mat1-2- <dig>  the part of the mat- <dig> locus which corresponds to region with noncanonical phylogeny is marked with blue bar. mat loci are flanked by conservative genes apn <dig> and sla <dig> in all sequenced strains.



we sequenced mat-locus in  <dig> additional strains of p. spp. to study it in more detail. two distinct idiomorphs of mat-locus were observed: mat <dig> idiomorph includes homolog of mat1-1- <dig> α-box transcription factor, homolog of mat1-1- <dig> high-mobility group  transcription factor, and an unknown gene which corresponds to mat1-1- <dig> in  <cit>  ; mat <dig> idiomorph includes mat1-2- <dig> hmg-box gene and an unknown gene which corresponds to mat1-2- <dig> in  <cit>  . phylogenetic configuration at mat-locus  is strikingly different from the rest of the genome . the boundaries of the segment with altered phylogeny reside at the ends of mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-1- <dig> genes for mat <dig> idiomorph and mat1-2- <dig> and mat1-2- <dig> for mat <dig> idiomorph, so that flanking regions have canonical phylogenetic configuration . the last ~ <dig> nucleotides of mat1-1- <dig> and mat1-2- <dig> are homologous to each other and unlike the rest of mat-locus have canonical phylogenetic configuration. multiple clades with both variants of mat-locus and slightly variable boundaries of such segments in different strains indicate multiple recombination events within the mat-locus .figure  <dig> phylogenetic configuration inside mat-locus  compared to flanking regions . strains with mat- <dig> locus are marked with red, strains with mat- <dig> locus are marked in blue. bootstrap values calculated from  <dig> bootstrap iterations.



no paralogs of mat-locus were found across p. spp. genomes, indicating that the observed pattern could not arise due to intragenomic conversion and, instead, implying multiple intergenomic recombination events at mat-locus. analysis of the mat-locus indicates that all sequenced strains are heterothallic. p. spp. strain sequenced by  <cit>  and p. destructants sequenced by “geomyces destructans sequencing project”  also heterothallic and both have mat <dig> configuration. according to  <cit>  homothallic configuration with two idiomorphs combined also occurs in p. spp., however no homothallic strain was detected among  <dig> fully-sequenced strains and  <dig> strains with only mat-locus sequenced suggesting that homothallism is rare in p.spp.

analysis of genomic regions with altered phylogenies
genotypes of vkm f- <dig>  vkm f- <dig>  and vkm f- <dig> form a tight clade  and can be used to estimate the impact of recombination on p. spp. population in more detail. for this clade we performed whole-genome search for the regions with altered phylogenetic configuration. within the alignment of vkm f- <dig>  and vkm f- <dig> genotypes to the rest of  <dig> p. spp. genotypes, there are  <dig> relatively short regions, of the total length of  <dig>  kb and average length of 878 nt , where phylogenetic relationships between genotypes vkm f- <dig>  vkm f- <dig>  and vkm f- <dig> differ significantly  from their canonical topology ) . among these regions,  <dig> supported topology ) and  <dig> supported topology ) . average nucleotide divergence between vkm f- <dig> and vkm f- <dig> in such regions is  <dig>  compared to genome average  <dig>  .figure  <dig> characteristics of genome regions with noncanonical topologies ) and ).  distribution of the regions by their length.  distribution of regions by nucleotide divergence between vkm f- <dig> and vkm f- <dig> 



figure  <dig> describes one of such regions. vkm f- <dig> becomes an outgroup to vkm f- <dig> and vkm f- <dig> inside the recombined region  in contrast to the flanking regions which maintain the canonical phylogenetic configuration . the genetic distances from recombined strain to strains from outside clades are not increased in this example as well as in the other regions with noncanonical phylogenetic configuration . thus, such regions did not arise due to hypermutation and, instead, were likely generated through some sort of the recombination events. in one case , a genomic region which supported ) topology was marked by a  <dig>  kb inversion present in vkm f- <dig> and vkm f- <dig> genotypes but not in any other p. spp. genotypes. this inversion was preceded by ~100 nt non-inverted segment which also supported ) topology. such a complex situation is very unlikely to arise through independent reversing mutations.figure  <dig> an example of the genome region with altered phylogeny across p.spp. multiple sequence alignments of  <dig> sequenced strains and phylogenetic trees corresponding to them are shown for the region of recombination  and for flanking regions  respectively. nucleotide sites with canonical topology ) are shown in green, nucleotide sites with noncanonical topology ) are shown in red. bootstrap values for phylogenetic trees were calculated in  <dig> replications. this recombination region corresponds to locus # <dig> in additional file:  <dig> table s <dig> 



sequence reads mapped back to assemblies ensure that regions with altered phylogenetic topologies could not be assembly artifacts as reads map normally on such regions and on their boundaries, with average coverage for this regions being the same to the rest of the genome. we considered a possibility of the intragenomic nonallelelic recombination. for  <dig> of the  <dig> regions we identified paralogs inside p. spp. using blast against the entire genome. however, none of these  <dig> paralogs could explain the pattern we observed.

the most plausible explanation for the regions with altered topology is the weak recombination activity between the distant p. spp. lineages. in the first example , vkm f- <dig> likely recombined with some genotype outside of ) clade, in the second example the inversion took place before the ) branching, but was eventually eliminated in vkm f- <dig> by recombination with some distant genotype .

exon sequences comprise  <dig> % of the p. spp. genome, but only  <dig>  nt in  <dig> regions out of the total  <dig>  nt in  <dig> recombination regions  overlap with exon sequences. the lack of coding sequences in recombination regions is likely due to a negative selection on high-distant recombination events at coding sequences.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
we sequenced and independently assembled genotypes of  <dig> haploid p. spp. strains. thus, we did not perform standard genotyping procedures including read mapping and snp calling but, instead, aligned the contigs which were obtained independently. we believe this method to be preferable to read mapping, because longer sequences are aligned and more robust alignments are obtained. longer sequences are particularly important in case of high nucleotide diversity within the aligned genotypes.

genome comparison of the sequenced strains reveals predominantly clonal structure of p. spp. lineages  which is consistent with the multiple observations of asexual-only reproduction of p. spp. strains  <cit> . the sequenced genomes are also very diverse with typical distance between strains from different clades ds ≈  <dig> . assuming that p. spp. produce no more than  <dig> generation per year  <cit>  and mutation rate is less than 10− <dig> per nucleotide per generation , we can estimate that the last common ancestor of p. spp. lived more than  <dig> mya. however, the strains are still very similar in functional sites as dn between distant lineages is ~ <dig> , synteny of genes is > <dig>  between different clades .

complete absence of genetic exchanges between strains would lead to a strict clonality of the population. however, there are evidences of recombination within a number of genes in anamorphic candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus  <cit> . we also observed such evidence in p. spp. phylogenetic structure of mat-locus and other regions with noncanonical topology indicates the exchange of this genome fragments between p. spp. lineages . recombination rate estimated from these regions is low:  <dig> recombination event per ~ <dig> single-nucleotide substitutions at synonymous sites, and only short genome regions are affected  . however, it is enough to cover an entire genome for a period of time passed since last common ancestor of p. spp. lineages, and thus, also contributed to the loss of linkage disequilibrium .

as in an asexual fungi candida glabarta  <cit> , in p. spp. we observed mat locus and other genes responsible for mating and meiosis in s. cerevisiae . interestingly, mat locus in p. spp. has phylogenetic configuration very different from the rest of the genome, indicating multiple transmissions between distant lineages at mat locus. however, in both candida glabarta and in vast majority of p. spp. sexual reproduction has never been observed, suggesting that either sexual processes are extremely rare, and thus are hard to detect, but are still important in these species, or that these genes have some functions other than sexual reproduction. evidence of recombination at mat locus and in other genome regions could also indicate parasexual activity which is known to be a substitute of sex for many ascomycota  <cit> . the other explanation could be horizontal gene transfer  across p. spp. hgt better fits the pattern observed for mat-locus phylogeny and could indicate presence of a vector which carries and transmits mat-locus across the population.

there are many economically significant species among ascomycota, including aggressive pathogens of plants and animals. recently p. destructans was shown to spread rapidly in north america and decimate bats populations  <cit> . however, population genetics and evolution of ascomycota species remain poorly understood due to low number of whole-genome data. our analysis reveals predominantly clonal evolution of p. spp. lineages. but despite a very long time passed since their last common ancestor, these strains still have very similar morphological traits and evidently occupy the same ecological niche. indeed, strains vkm f- <dig>  vkm f- <dig> and vkm f- <dig>  which belong to  <dig> distant clades , were all extracted from the permafrost samples of the same age  where no other organism could survive. furthermore, sequenced genomes indicate some sort of genetic recombination between diverged lineages. therefore we believe that p. spp. should be treated as the entity of lineages interacting with each other rather than an ensemble of independent species. this approach could also be useful in understanding evolution of the other ascomycota species with little or unknown sexual reproduction.
