BACKGROUND
ca2+ acts as one of the most diverse and widespread second messengers in cellular processes  <cit> . calmodulin  is a small, ubiquitous protein that acts as a calcium sensor to mediate several ca2+ signals  <cit> . cam is assumed to be involved in the activation of many enzymes, including cam-dependent protein kinases and protein phosphatase  . calcineurin  is a heterodimer consisting of a catalytic subunit a  and a regulatory subunit b   <cit> . although it is widely distributed, its primary sequence and structure is conserved among all eukaryotes. cna contains a catalytic domain, a cnb-binding domain, a cam-binding domain, and an autoinhibitory domain   <cit> . cam binds to the cam-binding domains on can and causes a conformational change that displaces an aid from the active site, which activates its phosphatase activity  <cit> .

cam binding sequences on cna are also called cam recruitment signaling  motifs. a cam target database   <cit>  has been built based on the structural and sequence information of the crs motifs. this database can be used to predict whether a sequence contains a cam-binding domain and to calculate the average hydrophobicity, the average hydrophobic moment, and the average propensity for a short peptide. many ca2+-dependent crs motifs have been identified as 1– <dig> or 1– <dig> class  <cit> . studies on these cam-binding proteins revealed the possibility of interacting residues on cna; however, there is no direct experimental evidence for the interaction.

studies have shown that can play important roles in regulation of stress responses. in budding yeast , can is required to maintain cell viability during cation stress and pheromone-induced growth arrest . calcineurin-dependent genes are activated by heat and ionic stress as well as when the cell wall is destroyed . recent studies have established a role for can in responding to alkaline ph and endoplasmic reticulum  stress  <cit> . in candida albicans, the main role of can is to respond to various stimuli or stress  <cit> . under normal growth conditions, can is not required for growth in s. cerevisiae. ethanol stress can activate the calcium-mediated calcineurin/crz <dig> pathway  <cit> . can play a role in the vitality of filamentous fungi, where a deletion mutant of cna <dig> exhibited changes in growth efficiency, mycelium morphology and sporulation  <cit> . in c. albicans, a pathogen of human, mutants of the catalytic subunit of calcineurin  and the calcineurin regulatory subunit  are sensitive to salt stress, alkali stress and osmotic stress  <cit> .

al exists in a trivalent cation  form under acid conditions, which is a toxic to animals, plants and microbes. al toxicity is one of the factors limiting crop productivity in acid soils. studies about the mechanisms of al tolerance can provide insight to solve the problem of al toxicity. cryptococcus humicola is a high al-resistant yeast strain isolated from an acidic field  <cit> . in order to survive in acid soil, it has evolved al-resistant mechanisms. therefore, c. humicola can be used as a model for studying the mechanisms of al toxicity and resistance. at the same time, the aluminum-resistant genes can be explored from c. humicola to improve the al-tolerance of the crops. our previous work proved that cam signal pathway involve in response to al stress. in rhodotorula glutinis, an inhibitor of calcineurin completely inhibited the growth of under al stress  <cit> . in this work, we aim to clone the gene of catalytic subunit of calcineurin  from c. humicola, analyze the expression of cna under al stress, identify the characteristics of interaction between cna and cam, and prove the al-tolerance ability of this gene in yeast. these results provide experimental data for the interaction between cam and cna and a theoretical reference for application of the gene in al-tolerance.

RESULTS
the role of cna in al stress
to examine the impact of can on the growth of c. humicola under al stress, fk <dig> was added to the culture medium containing 50 mm al3+. as shown in , the addition of al or fk <dig> in liquid medium without al slightly inhibited the growth of the strain. however, when fk <dig> was added to culture medium containing al, the growth of the strain was severely inhibited. these results suggest that can is involved in the growth of c. humicola under al stress.fig.  <dig> effect of fk <dig> on the growth of c. humicola under al stress. the initial od <dig> of each culture was adjusted to  <dig> , and fk <dig> was added to a final concentration of 1 μg/ml. the culture was then incubated at 30 °c while shaking at 200 rpm. the od <dig> was measured every 2 h. fk506: inhibitor of can. ck: al-free medium; al: medium containing 50 mm al3+; ck+ fk506: fk <dig> was added to the medium without al; al + fk506: fk <dig> was added to the medium containing 50 mm al3+. each sample was in triplicate, and three independent experiments were conducted




to study the transcription levels of cna under al stress, total rna of cells treated with al was used as the template for quantitative rt-pcr . as shown in  , the expression of cna increased gradually in cells treated with increasing concentrations or with the extension of treatment time. the expression level reached the maximum amount  when treated with 150 mm al3+ or treated for 36 h. to further study the expression of cna in translational levels under al stress, cultures of c. humicola treated with al were collected. western blot analysis was used to analyze the impact of al stress on cna protein levels. as shown in fig. 2c, the expression of cna protein gradually increased as the al concentration increased. when the concentration of al was 100 mm, the expression of cna reached its maximum level. these results indicate that al stress can affect the translation of the cna and that cna is involved in the response to al stress in c. humicola.fig.  <dig> analysis of the expression level of cna  and interaction of cna with cam  under al stress. qrt-pcr analysis of the transcription levels of cna in the presence of different concentrations of al  and different treatment time under 50 mm al3+ . the results were expressed as relative values with respect to 0 mm or 0 h, which were set to  <dig> , respectively. the data are presented as the mean ± se . c expression analysis of cna under al stress. total protein was extracted from cells treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 150 mm al3+. the membranes were probed with mouse antibodies against cna and with peroxidase-conjugated goat antibodies against mouse igg. d the interaction level of cna with cam under al stress. purified gst-cam and total protein from cells treated by al were incubated together. gst agarose resin was added. the interaction was detected with anti-cna and a specific polyclonal anti-cam antibody




to validate the effect of al stress on the interaction between cam and cna, gst-pull downs and western blot analysis were used. as shown in fig. 2d, the binding level of cna and cam upon treatment with increasing concentrations of al showed a gradual upward trend and reached a maximum level at concentration of 100 mm al3+, indicating that interaction between cam and cna was also affected by al treatment.

prediction of the cam-binding domain and the binding residues of cna
we submitted the cna sequence  to the cam target database   <cit> , which includes almost all published crs motif and obtained the putative cam-binding domain sequence. the cdna of cna encodes a  <dig> -kda protein with a cam-binding domain in its c-terminal region. the conserved hydrophobic residues in the cam-binding domain, i <dig>  i <dig>  v <dig>  and v <dig>  form a 1-8- <dig> motif, which is probably involved in the interaction with cam. i <dig> and f <dig> were predicted to be the anchor amino acids that possibly play an essential role in binding with cam. therefore, we decided to identify the roles of these five amino acids, which are shown in , in binding with cam and their role in activation of the phosphatase.fig.  <dig> partial nucleotide sequence of the cdna for cna and the deduced amino acids. the figures in the left and right margins indicate the amino acid and nucleotide positions, respectively. italics represent the predicted cam binding sequence. the amino acids shown in red indicate the position of hydrophobic residues that form the 1-8- <dig> motif. anchor amino acids are indicated by black boxes





expression and purification of the recombinant proteins
to determine the location of the cam-binding domain in the cna protein, a recombinant cna protein of full length and two deletion mutants were expressed in e. coli as his-tagged fusion proteins. to identify the essential amino acids in the cam-binding domain that bind to cam, we constructed site-directed mutants of cna. we mutated the five predicted amino acids to alanine. cdna for cna and all of the mutated cnas were cloned into the pet-32a  vector, expressed in e. coli bl <dig>  cells, and then purified.

sds-page gels showed clear cam recombinant protein bands at the position of the theoretical molecular weight of 42 kda . similarly, cna and their site-directed mutant protein  were shown at the position of  <dig>  kda . the molecular weights of the truncated proteins ∆cnab, ∆cnaa were  <dig>  kda and  <dig>  kda , respectively .

far-western blot analysis
binding of the truncated and mutant proteins to cam were assayed using far-western blot analysis. to identify the cam-binding domain, we transferred cna and its truncated proteins to nitrocellulose and verified their binding characteristics to cam. the deletion mutant ∆cnab  was detected to bind to cam, while the truncated protein ∆cnaa  showed hardly any binding with cam . this result was expected because ∆cnaa lacks the putative cam-binding region was detected hardly binding with cam. the results indicated that the region between r <dig> and s <dig> was responsible for the interaction with cam.fig.  <dig> analysis of the interaction between the recombinant proteins and cam by far-western blot. a far-western blot analysis of the binding of cna, ∆cnab, ∆cnaa with cam. lane  <dig>  protein standards; proteins samples were 40 μg. b analysis of the relative binding capacities of the truncated proteins with cam. c far-western blot analysis of the binding of cna, cna <dig>  cna <dig>  cna <dig>  cna <dig>  cna <dig> with cam. lane  <dig>  protein standards. proteins samples were 20 μg. d analysis of the relative binding capacities of the site-directed mutagenesis proteins with cam. relative activity analysis was performed by image j. the binding capacity of cna with cam was designated as 1




to determine which amino acid in the cam-binding domain was essential for the interaction with cam, we mutated five conserved hydrophobic amino acids and found that all the five mutated proteins could bind with cam . the binding capacity of cna with cam was stronger than that of the mutant proteins, while the binding capacity of cna <dig> and cna <dig> were the lowest of the five mutants . these results indicated that the conserved hydrophobic residues, i <dig>  i <dig>  v <dig>  v <dig>  and f <dig> all play a role in binding to cam, while i <dig> and i <dig> are the most important amino acids involved in binding to cam.

the effect of the cam-binding domain on the phosphatase activity of cna
to determine the role of the cam-binding domain in the activation of the phosphatase activity of cna, the activities of cna and its mutants were measured by a pnpp assay. the phosphatase activity of cna was designated as  <dig>  as shown in , the activity of the truncated protein ∆cnaa was greatly decreased and proved to be the lowest among all of these mutant proteins. the phosphatase activity of cna <dig> and cna <dig> was also decreased and lower than the other three site-directed mutant proteins and the wild-type protein. these results suggest that the region from r <dig> to a <dig>  ile <dig> and ile <dig> are not only important for binding to cam but also for activation of the phosphatase activity.fig.  <dig> comparison of the phosphatase activity of the mutant proteins with cna. the molar ratio of cam to cna or its mutant proteins was 2: <dig>  the absorbance was read at 410 nm. the activity of cna was designated as  <dig>  the experiments were repeated three times, and a representative set of data is shown




al resistance of transgenic yeast
to determine if cna can confer al tolerance in the transgenic yeast, a transgenic strain designated as sc-pyes3-cna was generated. the expression of the cna protein in the transgenic yeast was verified by western blot . a control strain named sc-pyes3/ct containing an empty vector and the transgenic strain were treated with different concentrations of al. the results showed that the transgenic yeast grew better than the control strain on plates with or without al. the transgenic yeast formed much bigger colonies than the control yeast when increasing the al concentration. in the presence of different al concentrations, the colonies formed by the transgenic strain were still much bigger than the colonies formed by the control strains . the growth of transgenic yeast and control yeast was assayed in liquid broth with 2 mm al3+. within the first 20 h, there was no significant difference between the growth of control and transgenic strains. during the stationary phase, the transgenic yeast grew better than the control yeast . these results suggest that cna conferred al tolerance in yeast.fig.  <dig> growth of transgenic yeast on solid media under al stress. yeast cells were pre-incubated in sc-liquid medium containing 2%  glucose to an od <dig> of  <dig> . ten-fold serial dilutions were prepared , and 5 μl of each dilution was spotted onto sc-trp medium supplemented with 2%  galactose and 0 mm,  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  mm, 1 mm, or 2 mm al3+. the results were recorded after the cultures were incubated at 30 °c for 3 days

detection of residual al in culture
to explore the reason for al tolerance in the transgenic yeast, the residual levels of active al in the culture after incubation of the yeast strains was determined. the transgenic yeast sc-pyes3-cna and the control yeast sc-pyes3/ct were cultured in broth medium containing  <dig>  mm and 2 mm al3+. the residual al levels in the supernatant were measured after eliminating the yeast cells. uninoculated media was shaken and used as a negative control, and the residual al content in this negative control was designated as 100%. the residual al content in the medium containing  <dig>  mm al3+ and the transgenic yeast in culture was significantly reduced to  <dig> % of the initial content . the residual al content in the medium containing 2 mm al3+ with the transgenic yeast in culture was also significantly reduced to  <dig> % of the initial content . the residual al in culture of control yeast had a slight reduction probably due to weak absorption of the cells. compared with the control strain,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the initial al content was removed by the transgenic yeasts when cultured in medium containing  <dig>  mm and 2 mm al3+, respectively. we speculated that the transfer of cna might promote the yeast to absorb the active al from the culture. the adsorption of al onto the cell surface or on the inside of the cells will need to be investigated further.fig.  <dig> assay of residual al in the culture after incubation with transgenic yeast in the presence of  <dig>  mm al3+  or 2 mm al3+ . uninoculated media was shaken and used as a negative control. the residual al in the negative control was designated as 100%. all values are the means of three replicates. asterisks represent significant differences when compared with the controls 




discussion
several cam-binding proteins, such as neuromodulin, myosin and calcineurin, have been identified in mammalian tissues. in this study, we characterized calcineurin from c. humicola. yap et al.  <cit>  had built a cam target database   <cit>  based on crs motifs structural and sequence information. in the present study, we identified a putative cam-binding domain in can and five key amino acids responsible for the interaction between can and cam based on the database.

our predicted result showed that conserved hydrophobic residues in the cam-binding domain formed 1-8- <dig> motif. because alanine has a relatively stable conformation and has little impact on the properties of the protein  <cit> , we substituted alanine for each of these five amino acids in the cam-binding domain. we found that these five amino acids were associated with cam binding, and i <dig> and i <dig> were identified as the most important amino acids involved in binding to cam. the positions of these five hydrophobic residues in the cam-binding domain are similar to their counterparts in short peptides. i <dig>  i <dig>  i <dig>  v <dig>  and f <dig> play an important role in binding with cam  <cit> . these results provide insight into the interactions between cam and cam-binding proteins.

several studies have demonstrated that signal pathways are involved in al tolerance in s. cerevisiae and r. glutinis, including the slt <dig> mitogen-activated protein kinase signal transduction pathway, the calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase  signaling pathways and the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase  <cit> . cyclosporin a is an inhibitor of calcineurin. the addition of cyclosporin a completely inhibited the growth of r. glutinis under al stress. our work demonstrated how the gene encoding calcineurin is involved in response to the aluminum stress and resistance to aluminum toxicity.

previous studies have demonstrated that cell walls contributed to metal ion tolerance in fungi, such as cd, zn, ni, cu and hg resistance . al stress also led to the increased thickness of the cell walls in rhodotorula sp. rs <dig>  the thickened cell walls contained 78% of the intracellular al  <cit> . calcineurin is required for cell wall biosynthesis. a variety of cell wall synthetic genes, such as genes encoding chitin synthase type i,  <dig> -β-glucan synthesis regulator rho <dig> and  <dig> -β-glucan synthase are regulated by the calcineurin/crz <dig> signal pathway  <cit> . in c. albicans, calcineurin is also important for fks <dig>  the β- <dig>  glucan synthase subunit  <cit> . expression of fks <dig> encoding a component of the β- <dig> -glucan synthase complex was increased in the c. neoformans cnb <dig> mutant  <cit> . fortwendel et al. reported that calcineurin signaling regulated chitin synthases at the transcriptional level  <cit> . the cell wall was thicker in all of the calcineurin deletion mutants of a. fumigatus  <cit> . in this study, residual al in the medium containing cna transgenic yeast in culture was significantly reduced compared to the original al content in the medium. therefore, we speculate that al may be absorbed by the cell walls of the transgenic yeast. whether cna increases al resistance through cell wall biosynthesis is currently being studied in our laboratory.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, fk <dig> inhibited the growth of c. humicola and the expression of cna was upregulated under al stress indicating that cna involved in al response. we used deletion and mutagenesis method to prove that the region between r <dig> and s <dig> is essential for the interaction with cam and i <dig>  i <dig> are key amino acids in this region responsible for interaction with cam. when introduced into yeast, cna could confer resistance to al. the possible mechanism of al tolerance is absorption of active al.
