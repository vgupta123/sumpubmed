BACKGROUND
sexual development provides an ideal model to study organogenesis since the gonads have the bipotential ability to form an ovary or a testis. wingless-type mmtv integration site family, member  <dig>  is a member of wnt gene family, and encodes a cysteine-rich secreted protein. wnt <dig> plays a pivotal role in early embryogenesis, particularly in the formation of the urogenital system  <cit> . after the action of sry in the xy gonad wnt <dig> expression decreases to undetectable levels in the developing testis, but remains at high levels in the ovary  <cit> . this led to the initial hypothesis that wnt <dig> acts as an anti-testis gene, blocking leydig cell differentiation and steroidogenesis in the developing ovary  <cit> . lack of wnt <dig> results in masculinization of xx mouse embryos  <cit>  and inhibits the migration of endothelial and steroidogenic cells into the developing ovary  <cit> , while over-expression of wnt <dig> in the developing testis interferes with testicular vascular development and decreases androgen production  <cit> . sertoli cell differentiation was also compromised in wnt <dig> mutant testes, demonstrating that wnt <dig> has specific and distinct roles in both male and female gonadal development  <cit> .

wnt <dig> appears to regulate dax <dig>  <cit> , a gene believed to antagonize the function of sry in the developing gonad. in vitro, dax <dig> transcription can be activated by β-catenin, a key signal-transducing protein in the wnt pathway  <cit> . besides dax <dig>  follistatin , encoding a tgf-β superfamily binding protein, may also be a downstream component of wnt <dig> signalling that regulates vascular boundaries and maintains germ cell survival in the ovary  <cit> . furthermore, wnt <dig> and fibroblast growth factor  <dig>  act as antagonistic signals to regulate differentiation of the ovary and testis  <cit> . to date most of our knowledge about the role of wnt <dig> in the mammalian gonad has been based on studies only in the mice. in order to determine the role of wnt <dig> in formation of the mammalian gonad we characterised its expression in a distantly related mammal.

marsupials give birth after a relatively short gestation to small altricial young that complete their development during a long lactation period attached to a teat, usually in a pouch. the tammar gonadal ridge develops about  <dig> days before birth, but the gonads remain undifferentiated until after birth  <cit> . testicular differentiation begins with the formation of seminiferous cords by day  <dig> post partum. the ovaries, as in all mammals, differentiate after the testis at about day  <dig> post partum, almost  <dig> days after the initial development of the gonadal ridge. in contrast to the tammar, the development of the mouse gonad is extremely rapid and there is only  <dig> day between the formation of the gonadal ridge and the onset of cord formation in males.

marsupials have the classical mammalian xy sex determining mechanism  <cit>  with a homologue of sry on the y chromosome  <cit> . however, the formation of some secondary sexual characteristics, including the scrotum and mammary glands, are under primary genetic control by genes on the x chromosome, and are not dependant on hormones from the testis  <cit> . several key genes in the sex determination and differentiation cascade, sry  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit> , sox <dig>  <cit> , sf- <dig>  <cit> , dax <dig>  <cit> , dmrt <dig>  <cit> , atrx/y  <cit> , amh/mis  <cit> , have now been cloned and characterized. the endocrine control of male sexual differentiation in the tammar has also been defined  <cit> . taken together, these data form a primary framework for understanding the evolution of the male sex-determining cascade in marsupials. however, nothing is yet known of the female gonadogenesis pathway in marsupials. this study has therefore characterized wnt <dig> during early development to gain insight into the onset of ovarian differentiation in a marsupial, and also to determine its expression during the extended period of testicular differentiation.

RESULTS
cloning and characterization of the tammar wnt <dig> gene
sequence analysis confirmed that pcr products were derived from the wnt <dig> gene . the longest sequence encodes a predicted protein of  <dig> amino acids.

wnt <dig> proteins are cysteine rich and highly conserved in all species. the n-terminus contains the transmembrane domains of about  <dig> amino acids, and other wnt gene family domains, all of which are highly conserved across species . the tammar wallaby wnt <dig> protein shares  <dig> % amino acid similarity with human,  <dig> % with mouse,  <dig> % with rat,  <dig> % with chicken,  <dig> % with frog,  <dig> % with zebrafish,  <dig> % with amphioxus . using the phylip  <dig>  program to construct a phylogenetic tree analysis of wnt <dig> proteins, tammar wallaby wnt <dig> clusters with eutherian mammals  whereas chicken and frog form another group, zebrafish and amphioxus produce different branches, c. elegans and fruit fly create another group distantly related to vertebrates .

southern blotting analysis of tammar genomic dna resulted in identical single bands of wnt <dig> in both male and female, indicating there is only a single copy of the wnt <dig> gene in tammar wallaby genome . the tammar wnt <dig> gene has  <dig> exons consistent with that of human, mouse and rat . exon  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  containing the functional domains, are highly conserved between eutherian mammals and the tammar.

wnt <dig> mrna distribution
semi-quantitative rt-pcr was carried out to analyze wnt <dig> gene expression patterns in various adult tissues. wnt <dig> expression was high in the testis, ovary and kidney. expression was weaker in the muscle and liver, but very low in the spleen and lung and absent in the brain, heart and prostate .

real-time quantitative pcr
using real-time quantitative pcr, the fetal gonads of both males and females had equally strong wnt <dig> expression levels  . after sexual differentiation, expression patterns differed between ovary and testis . in the presumptive ovary, wnt <dig> expression at day 1– <dig> and 4– <dig> post partum was half that in fetuses . wnt <dig> expression then significantly increased  to reach a peak at days 9– <dig> pp. at days 14– <dig> wnt <dig> remained much higher than in the male, but had decreased by day 41– <dig>  to the same level as in the male. in contrast, wnt <dig> was dramatically down-regulated to about 25% of the fetal level in the testis between birth and day  <dig> pp . after day  <dig> pp, the relative expression of testicular wnt <dig> doubled but remained at a much lower level than that of the ovary  until day 41– <dig> when gonads of both sexes had the indistinguishable levels of wnt <dig> expression  .

protein localization in tammar gonads
the human anti-wnt <dig> antibody  had an identical epitope sequence to the tammar wnt <dig> protein. western blot analysis detected a single protein of 39kd in each of the testis and ovary extracts, while the two negative controls  gave no cross-reaction, confirming the specificity of the antibody . before gonadal differentiation, wnt <dig> protein was widespread and localised in the somatic cells and surface epithelium of the gonads and mesonephroi of both sexes . in the ovary, after birth wnt <dig> immunostaining remained strong in the somatic cells . the wnt <dig> antibody clearly defined the cords of the rete ovarii and medulla after day  <dig> . mullerian ducts were positively stained . by day  <dig> post partum, wnt <dig> staining was strong in the cortical cells of the developing ovary . in the testis, shortly after birth when testis differentiation was seen, immunostaining of wnt <dig> protein decreased . wnt <dig> protein stained weakly during testicular differentiation between day  <dig> and  <dig>  but once initial cord formation was complete, wnt <dig> expression became stronger in some interstitial cells . strong staining was also seen in the tunica albuginea of the developing testis at all stages . by about day  <dig> post partum when germ cells begin to enter mitotic arrest, immunoreactivity in the testis was strong in the interstitium and clearly stained the cytoplasm of most of the putative leydig cells . however, wnt <dig> staining was not observed in the wolffian ducts . in the adult, wnt <dig> staining was weak in both ovary and testis .

discussion
we report the first molecular characterization and expression pattern of wnt <dig> in a non-eutherian mammal, the tammar wallaby. this is also the first localization of wnt <dig> protein in the gonad of any mammal. the greatly extended developmental time of marsupial gonads enabled us to complete the first detailed analysis of the changes in wnt <dig> expression throughout the whole of this critical developmental period. since the mouse testis undergoes rapid development, the period of wnt <dig> down-regulation that we have observed in the tammar testis occurs very rapidly in the mouse and so may have been missed. in the female, wnt <dig> is upregulated during the time of ovarian differentiation, but is down-regulated by the time the xx germ cells have all entered meiosis. in the male, it is down-regulated by the day of birth when testicular differentiation is occurring, but gradually increases by the time xy germ cells have all entered mitotic arrest. the conserved but differing expression patterns of wnt <dig> in the wallaby ovary and testis supports the idea that it has a critical role in gonadal development in both sexes.

the structure and role of wnt gene family is highly conserved in vertebrates  <cit> , and even in the sea anemone, a species representing the basal group within cnidarians  <cit> . however, the full-length wnt <dig> gene sequence has only been previously characterized in three mammals, and four non-mammalian vertebrates . the tammar wnt <dig> gene consists of five exons, exons  <dig> –  <dig>  the most highly conserved. the tammar wnt <dig> gene is present as a single copy in the genome of both males and females, indicating it is autosomal, as in other mammals . wnt <dig> participates in multiple developmental events during embryogenesis, is broadly expressed in many adult tissues in mice and humans and has also been implicated in adult tissue homeostasis  <cit> . semi-quantitative rt-pcr expression analyses in adult tammar tissues showed a similar pattern to that of human wnt <dig> consistent with a conserved and wide role for wnt <dig> in tissue homeostasis.

wnt <dig> also appears to be important for the normal pattern formation and development of both the male and female gonad  <cit> . in our study, using quantitative rt-pcr and immunohistochemistry, wnt <dig> was expressed at equal levels in the indifferent fetal and neonatal male and female gonads. at this time, protein in the ovary was localized to the somatic cells. subsequently, wnt <dig> mrna expression increased significantly to reach a peak at day 9– <dig>  the time that ovarian cortex and medulla can be distinguished. after ovarian differentiation at day 12– <dig> postpartum, wnt <dig> expression remained localized in cortex and at the boundary of the cortex and medulla, but by day  <dig> pp, there was stronger expression in the medulla. the decreased wnt <dig> expression in the ovary to a level similar to that in testis, coincides with the time female germ cells enter meiosis  <cit> .

in the testis, wnt <dig> gene expression was significantly down-regulated immediately after birth during the initial period of testicular differentiation, coinciding with the formation of seminiferous cords  <cit> . after cord formation, wnt <dig> levels increased slowly after day  <dig> postpartum and became specific to leydig cells. by day  <dig>  when secretion of testicular testosterone decreases   <cit> , leydig cells stained strongly for wnt <dig>  we suggest that once wnt <dig> reaches a critical threshold level, androgen production diminishes. the low level of immunostaining in the adult testis and ovary is consistent with their increase in steroidogenesis after puberty. this pattern of expression is therefore consistent with the hypothesis that wnt <dig> blocks initial testis differentiation, because the mrna concentration is dramatically reduced and the wnt <dig> protein is localized to the tunica during this period of testicular development.

CONCLUSIONS
the two hypotheses for wnt <dig> action as an anti-testis gene  <cit>  and as an important factor in testis development  <cit>  are not mutually exclusive. our data show that wnt <dig> is down-regulated for a brief period of time when the testis cords are first formed and the cell types of the testis determined, but then becomes up-regulated after day  <dig> post partum to control later testicular development. in the ovary, wnt <dig> remains strongly expressed in the gonad consistent with its role in inhibiting early testicular development and promoting later ovarian differentiation. it may also be important for the maintenance of germ cells in both females and males throughout development. our data support the conclusion that wnt <dig> functions not only as an anti-testis gene during early mammalian development, but is also necessary for later ovarian and testicular function.
