BACKGROUND
in eukaryotes, many cellular processes are regulated at the level of transcription. initiation of transcription by rna polymerase ii requires the assembly of the basal transcription apparatus at the core promoter, a region of about  <dig> bp flanking the transcription start site   <cit> . interactions mediated by components of the basal machinery and transcription factors that recognize specific cis-regulatory elements, frequently located upstream of the core promoter, ensure efficient and regulated transcription by rna polymerase ii at class ii promoters  <cit> . class ii core promoters often contain conserved dna elements recognized by components of the basal transcription machinery, the general transcription factors. the best-described core promoter dna element is the tata box, which is recognized by tata-binding protein . the tata box is a t/a-rich sequence usually located 25â€“ <dig> base pairs upstream of the tss  <cit> . recruitment of tbp and tbp-associated factors, all part of the tfiid complex, directs assembly of the pre-initiation complex , a highly regulated process that ensures precise initiation of transcription. the directionality of the pic is likely to be provided by the presence of another conserved element, present in a large fraction of class ii promoters, the bre   <cit> . in addition, initiator  elements are often present at the site of initiation of transcription in a number of eukaryotic core promoters. the inr is a loosely conserved element containing an adenosine at the tss and a c as the nucleotide preceding it , surrounded by a few pyrimidines  <cit> . the function of the inr and the components of the basal transcription machinery that recognize this element remain poorly defined.

in spite of the availability of a large number of computational programs that predict the presence of plant genes and their architecture , accurately identifying core promoters solely based on genome sequence analysis remains a daunting task. although no known dna-sequence motif is present in all plant core promoters, tata and inr motifs represent two elements that are often present  <cit> . a main limitation in the analysis of plant core promoters is the insufficient amount of information available regarding tsss, and hence the location of core promoters in genomic sequences. over the past few years, several efforts have initiated the high-throughput production and analysis of full-length  arabidopsis cdnas  <cit> . these fl-cdnas have dramatically improved the annotation of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , providing a powerful tool for the identification and analysis of core promoter elements.

here, we describe the analysis of core promoters of ca.  <dig>  arabidopsis genes, using publicly available fl-cdna sequences. our objectives for this study were to i) identify motifs characteristic of arabidopsis core promoters; ii) determine how often arabidopsis core promoters contain a tata box, and iii) compare the architecture of arabidopsis core promoters with those of drosophila, the only higher eukaryote for which such a genome-wide analysis has been performed. we examined the presence, distribution and consensus sequence of conserved motifs proximal to the tss. in addition to tata elements, we identified several other motifs, primarily representing microsatellite elements, some of them overrepresented in particular regions of core promoters. using nucleotide frequency matrices , we carried out a genome-wide analysis for the presence and position of tata-box elements. our studies show that only about 29% of all arabidopsis genes contain a recognizable tata element. the position of the tata motif with respect to the tss and correlations between the presence of a tata with est abundance and 5' utr lengths are discussed.

RESULTS
obtaining core promoter and 5' utr sequences for  <dig>  arabidopsis genes
as a first step towards identifying core arabidopsis promoters, we queried tair's gene search with the condition of a fl-cdna entry. we retrieved a total of  <dig>  non-redundant hits, derived from over  <dig>  total fl-cdnas deposited at tair. the locus ids for these  <dig>  fl-cdnas was used to retrieve the 5' utr corresponding to  <dig>  genes. the remaining  <dig>  genes for which a 5' utr was not retrieved corresponded to fl-cdnas that differed between the annotations at tair and tigr, sequences for which no 5'utr was annotated or sequences with 5' utr regions corresponding to alternative gene models.

the  and  regions of all  <dig>  genes was directly retrieved from the tair  <dig> bp upstream dataset. to obtain the  regions, we first checked the length of the 5' utrs, which was shorter than  <dig> bp for  <dig>  genes and which was interrupted by introns in  <dig>  genes. to include into our analyses these cases, three different strategies were followed. if the 5' utr was longer than  <dig> bp, and no introns were present in the corresponding  region , a direct retrieval of the  region was performed from the tair 5' utr dataset. if the 5' utr was shorter than  <dig> bp and no intron interrupted this region , we extended the 5' utr to  <dig> nt with a fragment of the immediately adjacent downstream coding sequence using the tigr cdna dataset. finally, if the 5' utr was shorter than  <dig> nt and an intron interrupted this region , we manually retrieved the  region from the genomic sequence using tair's seqviewer. after these analyzes, we were able to generate datasets corresponding to the ,  and  regions from a total of  <dig>  genes. these datasets were used for all the subsequent analyzes in this study.

identification of conserved motifs in core promoters
to identify sequence motifs overrepresented in arabidopsis core promoters, we first searched for dna elements conserved in the  and  regions of the  <dig>  arabidopsis genes. the search was carried using both meme and alignace . motifs correspond to short sequences , often recognized by a dna-binding protein, and which can be represented by a consensus sequence. while the total number of motifs retrieved per region with these algorithms was  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, only motifs detected in at least  <dig> sequences with either meme or alignace are shown . a comprehensive list and sequence of the remaining motifs is provided as additional file  <dig>  from  <dig> motifs present in  <dig> or more sequences in the  or  regions, seven were present in both regions , and thus were given the same numbers. motifs  <dig> and  <dig> are reverse-complements of each other, and they are shown separately because they are over-represented in different regions of the core-promoters . overall, the expectation maximization method meme appears to be a more robust motif search algorithm than the gibbs sampling method, alignace, since meme resulted in a significant higher rate of identification for most of the motifs . two motifs identified by meme  were not identified by alignace in any significant number of sequences. the distribution of the different motifs within the  or  regions was also investigated . in a few cases, there was a clear enrichment of motifs at particular positions. for example, motif  <dig>  only present in the  region, was clustered in the - <dig> to - <dig> region, motif  <dig>  present in both regions, clustered closer to the tss and motif  <dig> showed an enrichment in the vicinity of the - <dig> position .

overrepresentation of motifs in the  or  regions
to investigate whether the number of sequences containing each one of these motifs was accurately predicted by meme or alignace and to establish which of these  <dig> motifs was significantly overrepresented in the  or  regions, we retrieved nucleotide frequency matrices  for each one of these motifs from the results of the meme search . the nfms for each of these motifs, provided as additional file  <dig>  were used to determine their presence in the  or  regions. to establish whether the motifs were overrepresented in these regions, we used two background models. the first background model corresponded to an identical number of random sequences  with the same nucleotide composition as the  or  regions. because biological sequences are not random and intragenic sequences are richer in homopolymeric a/t than predicted by a random model with identical nucleotide composition, we used as the second background model the  <dig>  non-core promoter  regions. the results are shown in table  <dig> .

*number in parentheses indicate the frequency of the motif in the  <dig>   5' utr sequences without introns or coding regions.

motifs  <dig> and motifs  <dig> showed a clear overrepresentation in the  interval. motif  <dig> has all the characteristics of a tata box , and was detected in  <dig>  genes using the nfm, representing approximately 15% of all the genes investigated. a more detailed characterization of this motif is described below. motif  <dig> was detected in a much smaller number of genes , and the corresponding motif with the a a/g gccca t/a consensus was shown before to be overrepresented in upstream regions versus coding regions of arabidopsis genes  <cit> . consistent with our findings that show an increased accumulation of this motif towards the left border of the  interval , this motif was previously shown to have a strong positional preference for the  interval  <cit> . interestingly, in arabidopsis this motif is associated with dark-induced genes and is over-represented in genes under circadian regulation  <cit> .

three motifs were also found to be overrepresented in the  region. motif  <dig> resembles the n microsatellite represented at least two fold higher in the  region, compared to the  or the  regions . this overrepresentation cannot be explained by the modest difference in nucleotide composition between these regions, consistent with the comparable distribution in the randomly simulated datasets . as described above,  <dig>  of the  regions contain coding regions in addition to short 5' utrs. to investigate whether the coding sequences contributed to the overrepresentation of this motif, we analyzed the presence of this motif in the  <dig>   "clean" 5'utr regions, which do not contain any coding or intron sequences . in these  <dig>  sequences, motif  <dig> was found in  <dig>  sequences, the same frequency as in the original dataset . thus, this n microsatellite is overrepresented in the  region, irrespective of whether it is coding or 5' utr. n microsatellites have been extensively researched in humans  <cit> , but not yet associated with any functional role in arabidopsis.

motif  <dig>  with the consensus t/a ccggcga , was detected by both meme and alignace only in the  region . this motif, however, was not identified as the binding site for any known transcription factor, as deduced from searching the place  <cit> , transfac  <cit>  and agris  <cit>  databases .

finally, motif  <dig>  present in a significant number of sequences , fits the kozak consensus  for a translation start atg codon  <cit> . consistently,  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  sequences in which we found motif  <dig> have a short 5' utr, reflected in that this motif is present in just  <dig> 5' utr  sequences . while this motif is irrelevant to our analysis, it provides a good internal control regarding the sensitivity and comprehensiveness of our search for motifs in the  and  regions.

motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> correspond to microsatellites commonly found in arabidopsis  <cit> , displaying similar frequency distributions in the  and  regions. from these  <dig> motifs, only motif  <dig> does not seem to be significantly overrepresented in these two regions, when compared to the  sequences . the potential participation of microsatellites in the control of gene expression is unclear, but according to recent studies in rice and arabidopsis, their distribution may follow a gradient in the direction of transcription  <cit> . motif  <dig> conforms to a n microsatellite, frequent in monocots such as rice, but not often found in arabidopsis  <cit> , which is consistent with a low but comparable frequency in all three regions studied here . the apparent higher frequency of motif  <dig> in the  region, compared to the  , is likely to correspond to an increased g/c content of the 5' utr , as reflected by the increased distribution of this motif in a random simulation of sequences with the same nucleotide composition of the corresponding  region . motif  <dig>  corresponding to a n microsatellite , was found to be only slightly overrepresented in the  region, compared to the  background model . interestingly, however, this motif is significantly clustered in the  region . a similar clustering was not observed in the  region, where this motif is significantly overrepresented, compared to the background models .

motif  <dig>  with the consensus sequence aaacccta , and similarly overrepresented in the  and  regions, compared to the random or  background models , does not conform to a typical microsatellite sequence. interestingly, however, the sequence of motif  <dig> is precisely the reverse complement of motif  <dig>  which with the tagggttt dna-consensus fits the sequence of the arabidopsis telomeric sequence  <cit> , and of the telobox, the binding site for a myb-related telomeric dna-binding protein previously described in proteins from yeast, plants and animals  <cit> . this element, present in the 5' utr or promoter region of many genes encoding products associated with the translational apparatus  <cit> , was also shown to participate in the expression of arabidopsis root meristem genes  <cit> . our analysis suggests that the number of sequences containing the telobox motif in either the forward or reverse-complement configuration is much larger than previously reported  <cit> . consistent with previous studies  <cit> , only a few genes  contain motif  <dig> or  <dig> in both the  and  regions.

we also investigated for the presence of motifs previously shown to be overrepresented in the  regions of drosophila core promoters  <cit> . using the corresponding nfms, we searched our databases for dre  and dpe , usually found ~ <dig> nt downstream of the tss  <cit> . although the  region is shifted  <dig> bp towards the 5' end from our selection, the positional clustering of the dre and dpe motifs  <cit>  still falls under the  region investigated here. in our analyses, neither one of the two motifs was represented at a level significantly higher than in the random models . a ccaat box nfm  <cit>  did not result in any significant distribution change between real and randomly generated datasets for both regions . this was expected because ccaat boxes usually cluster around the - <dig> position  <cit> , which is outside of the  interval investigated here, corresponding to what is generally recognized as the core promoter region. similarly, none of the motifs identified here appeared to correspond to inr elements. we conclude that, with the exception of the tata box, the elements involved in the architecture of core promoter in arabidopsis and drosophila are overall different.

distribution of tata motifs in core arabidopsis promoters
according to our analysis for conserved core promoter elements, motif  <dig>  is likely to represent the tata box characteristic of many class ii promoters. consistent with this idea, motif  <dig> is significantly overrepresented in the  region  with a clear clustering in the - <dig> to - <dig> region . surprisingly, however, motif  <dig> was only detected in 15% of the  <dig>  core promoters investigated, lower than found in previous studies, which suggested that 57% of plant genes had a tata box  <cit> . to investigate this striking difference between previous estimates for the frequency of a tata box in arabidopsis promoters and our own analyses, we utilized the previously described tata nfm  <cit> . with this nfm, motifscanner identified  <dig>  tata motifs in the  region, significantly higher than the number of hits in the  region, or in the corresponding background models . thus, according to this analysis,  <dig> % of all arabidopsis genes contain a tata, comparable to the number of drosophila core promoters suggested to contain a tata box   <cit> , but still significantly lower than previously reported for the analysis of  <dig> plant promoters  <cit> . interestingly, however, if these prior studies are restricted to just the  <dig> sequences from arabidopsis, only  <dig> showed the presence of a tata, representing a frequency of  <dig> %, comparable to our own results. previous studies also suggested that plant tata-less promoter were the exception  <cit> , and that tata-less promoters were mainly restricted to photosynthetic  <cit>  and plastid ribosomal genes  <cit> . our results, however, indicate that tata-less promoters are found more frequently than tata-containing promoters. we cannot rule out that arabidopsis is the exception among the plants, a possibility to be considered given the much lower percentage of tata-containing promoters in arabidopsis compared to other plants  <cit> . more likely, however, the lack of a good knowledge of the position of the tss may have resulted in previous studies in a very significant over-estimate of the presence of tata elements. as an example, if the search for tata elements is carried out on the  <dig>   regions,  <dig>  sequences  or  <dig>   are retrieved as containing a significant hit to a tata element , corresponding to  <dig> % and 70% respectively, much closer to previous, yet likely incorrect, estimates  <cit> .

the sequences from all these putative tata-containing promoters were retrieved and the nfms were retrained with this new information. the new matrix obtained from  <dig>  sequences gathered using our meme nfm  is shown in table  <dig>  similarly, the plantprom tata nfm was retrained with the  <dig>  sequences, resulting in an improved and expanded nfm . these nfms provide robust tools for the identification of additional plant tata motifs. the two nfms are significantly better than previously available plant tata nfms, with regards to the addition of flanking sequences that permit to expand the tata consensus, and because of the much larger number of sequences used to build them. they have very similar nucleotide distributions, probably the biggest difference being at position  <dig>  were the matrix derived from our meme analysis has a much stronger requirement for an a .

the new nfms were used to scan the  region and establish where each of them localized a tata with the highest probability. as shown in figure 2a, both nfms showed a significant peak in the  region, consistent with the position expected for tata elements. to establish the average distance of tata elements to the tss, the meme and plantprom tata nfms were used to scan the  <dig>   regions and the positions of the corresponding tata boxes were recorded and graphed . the average distance of a tata  to the tss is  <dig>  nt . thus, the position of the tata box in arabidopsis is more similar to what is typically the case in animal promoters, usually 25â€“ <dig> nt from the tss  <cit>  than what is found in yeast, where the tata box has a variable position in the  region  <cit> .

we investigated whether the presence of tata motifs correlated with other properties of the corresponding genes. based on our analysis of the  <dig>  fl-cdnas, we determined that the average size of the 5' utr of arabidopsis genes is  <dig> nt . interestingly, when we compared the average length of the 5' utrs of tata-containing versus tata-less genes, we found that tata-containing genes had an average of  <dig> nt in their 5' utrs, compared to  <dig> nt in tata-less genes. this difference in the length of the 5' utrs between these three populations of genes is evident in the sway towards shorter 5' utrs in the tata-containing population . the reason for this difference in 5' utr length between tata-containing and tata-less promoter is not clear, although it is possible that the longer 5' utr provide additional features that contribute to pic assembly. we also investigated whether the presence of a tata element made a difference in the times that each gene was represented in ests, an approximate indication of the relative level of expression of the corresponding gene. while each arabidopsis gene is represented in average by  <dig>  ests , the  <dig>  sequences utilized here are represented in average by  <dig>  ests, suggesting that the available fl-cdnas are likely to correspond to genes expressed at a higher level than the average arabidopsis gene. interestingly, however, tata-containing genes were represented in average by  <dig>  ests , whereas tata-less genes were represented by just  <dig>  ests. these results suggest that the presence of a tata is generally associated with genes expressed at a higher level. gene ontology analyses  did not provide any insights on possible cellular functions associated with these gene clusters . an analysis of the sequences flanking the tss, and likely containing the inr element, did not reveal any significant difference in nucleotide composition between tata-containing and tata-less promoters . thus, the assembly of the pic is likely to occur in arabidopsis tata-less promoters solely through the inr, or regulatory elements outside of the  region investigated here also participate in the recognition of the core promoter by components of the basal transcriptional machinery.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the architecture of core promoters is central to establishing the mechanisms by which the basal transcriptional machinery assembles and facilitates formation of the pre-initiation complex. we provide here the first genome-wide analysis of arabidopsis core promoters. we have identified several motifs overrepresented in core promoters, with respect to background models consisting of random sequences of identical nucleotide composition or intergenic regions. with the exception of microsatellites similarly distributed in the  and  regions and the tata element, for which an in-depth analysis was carried out, most other overrepresented motifs were present in only a small subset of the sequences analyzed. our studies provide robust nfms corresponding to tata elements and other conserved motifs, and show that only 29% of all arabidopsis promoters contain a tata element located in average approximately  <dig> nt upstream of the tss. the absence of a tata correlates with a lower representation of the corresponding gene in public est collections as well as with longer 5' utr sequences. however, the absence of a tata is not compensated for by the overrepresentation of any one of several motifs present in drosophila core promoters, suggesting significant differences in the organization of core promoters from animals and plants.
