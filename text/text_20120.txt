BACKGROUND
pyrenochaeta lycopersici is the soil-borne fungal pathogen responsible for corky root rot  disease in tomato  <cit> . the fungus also infects other solanaceous species including pepper, eggplant and tobacco, and other cultivated crops such as melon, cucumber, spinach and safflower  <cit> . the pathogen causes significant yield losses in tomato crops, both in the greenhouse and in the field, in many tomato-growing areas of the world. the majority of commercial varieties are susceptible to p. lycopersici and sources of partial genetic resistances occur only in wild tomato species  <cit> . the use of susceptible cultivars combined with continuous cropping and the lack of effective soil treatments has encouraged the rapid spread of crr disease resulting in fruit yield losses of up to 75%  <cit> . the sequencing of 18s nrdna  and 28s nrdna  indicate that p. lycopersici is an ascomycete in the order pleosporales, along with other necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic plant pathogens representing genera such as cochliobolus, pyrenophora, phaeosphaeria, leptosphaeria, pleospora, phoma and didymella <cit> . a low grade of genetic variability was shown within p. lycopersici isolates, when investigated by rapd and rflp analysis  <cit> , and the use of issr and aflp markers  <cit> .little is known about the biology, life cycle and infection structures of this species. a telomorph has not been described and even the anamorph is rare in nature. the latter is characterized by pycnidia containing solitary, mostly branched conidiophores bearing hyaline unicellular conidia . they have never been found on infected tissues in nature and sporulation is difficult to induce in culture. p. lycopersici produces microsclerotia on host plant roots and in artificial medium , and these are the overwintering structures and primary infective propagules in the soil, remaining dormant but viable for at least  <dig> years  <cit> . under favorable conditions, hyphae germinate from the sclerotia and asymptomatically infect the epidermal cells of host roots . approximately 48h after initial penetration, the infected host cells die and secondary hyphae develop within them, a stage associated with the appearance of disease symptoms such as tissue browning and necrosis . the invasion of living host cells by primary hyphae continues at the expanding margins of the lesion, surrounding a central zone of dead cells. p. lycopersici is generally recognized as a hemibiotroph, with biotrophy and necrotrophy probably occurring simultaneously during the later stages of infection, as the necrotic lesions expand and the cells walls are degraded by lytic enzymes  <cit> . ultimately, the main root is entirely colonized causing the typical corky root lesions, whereas secondary roots often escape infection   <cit> . only a few p. lycopersici sequences  are deposited in the ncbi database, and little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in p. lycopersici pathogenicity/virulence and host–pathogen interactions. recently, a cdna-aflp based transcriptomic approach was used to monitor the expression of plant and pathogen genes during a compatible interaction between p. lycopersici and tomato  <cit> . this allowed the subsequent isolation and characterization of a p. lycopersici endoglucanase which is strongly induced during the infection of tomato roots and whose expression is positively correlated with disease progression  <cit> . a secreted pathogenicity factor that induces cell death during the penetration of tomato roots has also been identified  <cit> . here we report the de novo assembly of the p. lycopersici genome based on illumina sequencing and the functional characterization of the draft sequence by integrating rna-seq data, followed by an in-depth analysis of the virulence mechanisms and potential pathogenicity effectors encoded by this soil-transmitted pathogen.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
genomic dna obtained from the virulent p. lycopersici isolate cra-pav_er  <dig> was sequenced using illumina 100-bp paired-end reads. two libraries were prepared with mean fragment sizes of  <dig> and  <dig> bp respectively and sequenced obtaining  <dig> millions of fragments for a total of 17gb, corresponding to approximately 300-fold coverage of the final assembly.

the p. lycopersici genome was assembled de novo using a de bruijn graph-based  assembly strategy with a k-mer of  <dig>  before reassembly using the overlap-layout-consensus  method. we chose to use this strategy to take advantage of both the higher efficiency of dbg method in assembling millions of reads and the higher sensitivity of olc method  <cit> . in fact, the olc re-assembly of sequences previously assembled with dbg method reduced the total number of sequences by a 40%  while increasing the average contig length by a 60%  and not reducing significantly the total number of assembled bases .

the assembly statistics are summarized in table  <dig>  comprising  <dig>  contigs with an n <dig> of  <dig>  kb for a total sequence of  <dig>  mb. the comprehensiveness of the gene space covered by the assembly and annotation procedures was assessed by screening for  <dig> core eukaryotic genes   <cit>  revealing hits for  <dig> cegs  with complete match and  <dig> with partial match  .

gene annotation
genes were annotated by a combination of ab initio prediction  <cit>  followed by the reference annotation-based transcript  assembly of sequences obtained from the rna-seq analysis of two p. lycopersici samples grown in vitro and during interaction with tomato cv moneymaker, respectively  <cit> . we annotated  <dig>  genes with  <dig>  transcripts, among which  <dig>  loci were detected by both approaches and  <dig>  only by the analysis of rna-seq data . thus, while the number of genes might be slightly overestimated because of ab initio prediction limitations, at least  <dig> % of the annotations were supported by experimental evidences. we confirmed that the assembly was able to capture full-length genes by searching the predictions for full open reading frames , finding that most of the genes  contained start and stop codons. the rna-seq data were then assembled de novo and the resulting contigs were mapped onto the draft genome. from the  <dig> , <dig> reads, we obtained  <dig>  putative transcripts,  <dig>   of which could be mapped onto the assembled genome further validating the comprehensiveness of the gene space represented.

many of the identified transcripts  were conserved in other species as shown by hits against sequences in the ncbi nr protein database  and the uniprot swissprot fungi protein database . this analysis showed that the most represented species were fungal pathogens and the top four species were phytopathogenic fungi . based on the identity of the most similar proteins, at least one gene ontology term was assigned to  <dig>  transcripts. the most represented functional categories are summarized in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  we found  <dig>  orphan genes  with no matches against known proteins or protein domains  <cit> , which is similar to the proportion of orphan genes found in sordaria macrospora   <cit>  and macrophomina phaseolina   <cit> . rna-seq analysis showed that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  orphan genes were transcribed and were therefore likely to be functional.

phylogenetic relationships
the phylogenetic analysis based on whole genome sequences of p. lycopersici and  <dig> other fungal species with diverse lifestyles  is shown in figure  <dig>  this confirmed that p. lycopersici belongs to the class dothideomycetes and the order pleosporales. a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, using rhizopus oryzae as the outgroup, revealed four major clusters representing saccharomycetes, leotiomycetes, sordariomycetes and dothideomycetes. p. lycopersici appeared to be more closely related to hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic plant pathogens of the genera leptosphaeria, pyrenophora and stagonospora than to biotrophs such as the genera blumeria and ustilago.

we performed a pairwise comparison between p. lycopersici and fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lycopersici genomes to assess the genomic distribution of similarity regions. we choose f. oxysporum among the top ranked species  as a complete genome anchored to chromosomes was available for this fungus. as expected the analysis showed regions of similarity at aminoacidic level throughout all the f. oxysporum chromosomes with the exception of the four f. oxysporum dispensable chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

vegetative incompatibility
fungi can propagate both by sexual and vegetative reproduction. the latter is controlled by approximately  <dig> heterokaryon incompatibility  modules in most pathogenic fungi, whereas there was evidence of  <dig> modules in p. lycopersici . accounting for a possible overestimation of the total number of genes by a 40%, based on the percentage of annotations not supported by rnaseq data, the het protein modules are anyway expanded by  <dig>  times, in average, compared to other fungi. other proteins that are functionally associated with het contain ntpase, nb-arc and nacht domains, which are involved in the regulation of the immune response and are related to apoptosis/programmed cell death in animals and fungi  <cit> . we identified  <dig> nacht proteins encoded by the p. lycopersici genome, which is slightly more than the number in f. oxysporum  and much higher than in other fungi, which range from  <dig> in blumeria graminis to  <dig> in colletotrichum graminicola. the p. lycopersici genome also encoded a significantly greater number of proteins containing ankyrin  and tetratricopeptide repeats , which mediate protein-protein interactions among het proteins. altogether, the number of hi related proteins includes  <dig> domains, e.g. more than double the number encoded by the imperfect fungal pathogen f. oxysporum. about 75% of the modules for all the families related to vegetative incompatibility were supported by rnaseq expression data.

pathogenesis related genes
we screened the p. lycopersici genome sequence against phi-base, a database that collects pathogenicity, virulence and effector genes from fungi, oomycetes and bacterial pathogens. this revealed that  <dig>   of the p. lycopersici genes were homologous to putative pathogenicity genes . comparative analysis with nine sequenced filamentous fungi showed that the gene families with the largest number of shared pathogenicity genes were heterokaryon incompatibility proteins , glycoside hydrolase proteins , major facilitator superfamily  type membrane transporters , fungal transcription factors , protein kinases  and cytochrome p <dig>  .

selected protein families highly represented in p. lycopersici genome. an, aspergillus nidulans; bc, botrytis cinerea; bg, blumeria graminis; cg, colletotrichum graminicola; fo, fusarium oxysporum; lm, leptosphaeria maculans; nc, neurospora crassa; pl pyrenochaeta lycopersici; ptr, pyrenophora tritici repentis; sn, stagonospora nodorum. *the cutoff of significance is set at p <  <dig> . **benjamini and hockberg method was used to calculate adjusted p-values  <cit> .

the atp-binding cassette  transporters and mfs-type membrane transporters were largely represented in the p. lycopersici genome, comprising  <dig> and  <dig> modules respectively . transcriptome analysis showed that 85% of abc modules and 75% of mfs-type membrane transporters belonged to transcripts expressed. the p. lycopersici genome also encoded a large number  of cytochrome p <dig> proteins, as shown for other necrotrophic and hemibiotrophic pathogens such as b. cinerea , c. graminicola , f. oxysporum  and s. nodorum .

the p. lycopersici predicted genes also included  <dig> sequences matching  <dig> different subfamilies of peptidases . almost all known peptidase families were represented in the p. lycopersici transcriptome, with dmpa aminopeptidase  <dig>  as the only exception. the most represented clans were the serine peptidase  and metallopeptidase , a common feature of fungal pathogens. the comparative analysis of gene families and pfam domains with several other fungi showed that the number of peptidases in p. lycopersici is comparable to other hemibiotrophic pathogens as c. graminicola and f. oxysporum. metallopeptidase group of aminopeptidases  were highly represented, with  <dig> domains in p. lycopersici  compared to  <dig> and  <dig> of c. graminicola and f. oxysporum respectively. analysis of expression data confirmed that  <dig> of this modules  corresponded to expressed transcripts. other metallopeptidase gene families had also undergone expansion in the p. lycopersici genome, including pappalysin, ste <dig> and deubiquitinating peptidase . a summary is reported in figure 3d.

genes involved in carbohydrate degradation 
carbohydrate degradation is an important component of fungal pathogenicity and virulence, so we examined the p. lycopersici cazome in detail compared with nine other fungi with complete genome sequences . the p. lycopersici genome encodes  <dig> cazyme modules, including  <dig> glycoside hydrolases,  <dig> glycosyltransferases,  <dig> polysaccharide lyases,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases and  <dig> carbohydrate-binding modules . ce <dig> and ce <dig> families of carbohydrate esterases including acetyl xylan esterase , cinnamoyl esterase , feruloyl esterase , carboxylesterase , s-formylglutathione hydrolase  and sterol esterases are particularly represented  similarly to other hemibiotrophs such as c. graminicola and f. oxysporum . cellulose-degrading enzymes were also well represented in p. lycopersici, including seven cellobiohydrolases , ten β- <dig> -glucanases  and eight gh <dig> glycoside hydrolases . finally, the complex of carbohydrate cleaving enzymes was completed by  <dig> genes encoding polysaccharide lyases, including  <dig> encoding pl <dig> 

discussion
we report here the first genome analysis of a pyrenochaeta species, the soil-borne filamentous fungus of ascomycete clade pyrenochaeta lycopersici, which is the etiological agent of tomato corky root rot. the p. lycopersici genome assembly shows that a genome reconstruction approach based uniquely on paired-end illumina reads is highly effective in reconstructing contigs containing almost full length genes. to validate the genome assembly we assessed the completeness of the gene space represented and we found that, in fact, most of the core eukaryotic conserved genes and the transcripts reconstructed from rna-seq data of fungus grown in vitro and during interaction with the host were represented on the assembled genome. based on published assemblies for the phytopathogens l. maculans, p. teres, p. nodorum and p. tritici-repentis the number of annotated genes in p. lycopersici is very similar   <cit> . most of the gene annotations are supported by the presence of a full orf  and a large fraction of them is validated by rna-seq data , thus representing an high quality resource for the study of functions encoded by p. lycopersici genome. it’s worth noting that we also identified more than  <dig>  genes supported by transcriptomic data but not detected by the prediction algorithm. this is not completely surprising as, even if properly trained, a prediction software will not predict all the genes of an eukaryote organism. an hybrid annotation approach, based on integration of gene predictions and massive parallel sequencing of transcripts, is thus needed to perform a comprehensive annotation of genes in a fungal genome. overall these data confirm the high quality of the assembly and annotation obtained particularly in terms of the completeness and quality of the gene catalog represented.

the p. lycopersici assembly produced constitutes an invaluable support to understand the unique phenotypical features of this pathogen and allow to investigate the molecular basis of the reproductive behavior and of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis. sexual mating of p. lycopersici has never been observed in nature, leading to speculation regarding its reproductive cycle. in agreement with its reproductive behavior based on generating spores  by mitosis, p. lycopersici apparently lacks of mating-type  genes that control the choice between sexual and asexual reproduction, suggesting the species is incapable of sexual reproduction. a potential alternative source of genetic variation in p. lycopersici is vegetative hyphal fusion controlled by het genes, allowing horizontal gene or chromosome transfer potentially followed by non-meiotic recombination. when individuals with the same het genotype meet, they can produce a viable heterokaryon by anastomosis, whereas individuals with different het genotypes form a fusion cell which is compartmentalized and undergoes a form of programmed cell death termed vegetative or heterokaryon incompatibility  <cit> . although the significance of heterokaryon incompatibility responses is poorly understood  <cit> , it may limit the transmission of mycoviruses and other deleterious replicons between strains  <cit> . strong selective pressure is likely to be responsible for the extensive amplification of het genes and genes with related functions in p. lycopersici, suggesting that het genes play a key role in the transfer of genetic information in this species, and that a strict regulation of the vegetative reproduction is important for the generation of the variability necessary for the adaptation to the environment and to host defense mechanisms.

from a pathogenetic perspective p. lycopersici is considered a hemibiotrophic fungus because cell wall hydrolytic activity is not detected during the initial infection of tomato plants and few symptoms are visible, whereas later infection involves the secretion of cell wall degrading enzymes that cause the root to collapse  <cit> . this was confirmed by our data by the comparison of p. lycopersici sequences with those of other fungi which showed a clear phylogenetic relationship with hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic plant pathogens. moreover, the analysis of gene functions and comparison of gene sequences with those of other fungi showed that a large fraction of genome is devoted to pathogenetic activity and showed a large overlap of the gene inventory to that of other plant pathogens such as l. maculans, p. teres, p. nodorum and p. tritici-repentis.

the first and major barrier to infection by fungal pathogens in plants is the cell wall and cellulose is the main component of plant biomass. phytopathogenic fungi therefore secrete a cocktail of hydrolytic enzymes known as carbohydrate-active enzymes , which are required to penetrate and then degrade the cuticle and cell wall  <cit> . the analysis of cazome of p. lycopersici showed a stronger resemblance to that of hemibiotrophic and necrotrophic plant pathogens such as c. graminicola, l. maculans and p. tritici-repentis than to that of biotrophs such as b. graminis. in fact, the p. lycopersici genome encoded a large number of cellulose-degrading enzymes, as glycoside hydrolases, required for the complete breakdown of the plant cell wall for successful infection. in particular, the ce <dig> and ce <dig> families of carbohydrate esterases, which are required to degrade hemicellulose and thus facilitate the complete hydrolysis of polysaccharides in the cell walls of a wide range of plant species, as well as pectate-lyases  were largely represented. this may reflect in an enhanced activity in cleaving pectic polymers, which are more abundant in dicotyledonous plants. among the glycoside hydrolases, the gh <dig> family carries out cellulose hydrolysis using a synergic mechanism in concert with canonical cellulases  <cit> . the expansion of the gh <dig> family in p. lycopersici mirrors the expansion of this family in the order pleosporales <cit> . the gh <dig> gene family is exclusive to fungi and structure–function analysis of some enzymes belonging to this class, showed they cleave cellulose using an oxidative mechanism, and therefore they are not canonical glycoside hydrolases. the new biochemical mechanism proposed for gh <dig> proteins redefined this class of enzymes as polysaccharide monooxygenases   <cit> . a p. lycopersici endo-β- <dig> -glucanase gene  from the gh <dig> family is expressed in a manner that corresponds to disease progression  <cit> . plegl <dig> is thus far the only gene known to be induced in a fungal phytopathogen during infection, suggesting a role in pathogenesis. these data suggest the hypothesis that p. lycopersici might have evolved diverse strategies for cellulose digestion.

other proteins which play an important role in the interaction with the host by detoxifying plant defense compounds are cytochrome p <dig> proteins. p. lycopersici, similarly to other hemibiotroph and necrotroph fungal pathogens, shows an high number and an high variety of genes coding for this protein family.

peptidases are pathogenicity-related enzymes that are secreted to facilitate penetration and colonization of the host by degrading the plant cell wall  <cit>  and are required for the degradation of plant defense proteins  <cit> . the p. lycopersici genome encodes a large number of metallopeptidases, covering  <dig> major peptidase families and  <dig> subfamilies, in agreement with the general properties of dothideomycetes genomes, mostly representing hemibiotrophs  <cit> . the comparison of  <dig> genomes revealed that dothideomycetes have a wider range of exopeptidases and endopeptidases than other fungal phytopathogens, including the greatest number of secreted metallopeptidases, but fewer aspartic peptidases  than necrotrophs, saprotrophs and ectomycorrhizal symbionts  <cit> . the aminopeptidase gene family is the most highly represented among all the metallopeptidase families represented in the p. lycopersici genome and it is well documented that bacteria and fungi which secrete aminoproteases are generally pathogenic  <cit> .

another class of proteins which play an important role during host invasion is that of transporters. transporters import nutrients and export secondary metabolites produced by the fungal pathogens as virulence factors but have a role also in removing toxic compounds. in particular, abc and mfs transporters are the major families involved  <cit>  as they are required to export host-specific toxins  and mycotoxins  <cit> , remove inhibitory defense compounds such as phytoalexins produced by the host plant  <cit> , and confer resistance to fungicides  <cit> . although the virulence of the fungus is not strictly dependent on the abundance of these transporter families  <cit>  is notable that the abc transporter family in p. lycopersici, together with f. oxysporum, is the most diverse and abundant compared to all the other fungi, and is therefore likely to be intimately associated with the virulence mechanism. overall the analysis of p. lycopersici genome clearly shows that this pathogen evolved its pathogenetic mechanisms through an expansion both of genes involved in the penetration and degradation of the host tissues and by the expansions of gene families necessary to counteract the defense mechanisms of the host.

CONCLUSIONS
p. lycopersici genome reveals a significative expansion of specific genes families related both to pathogenesis and to reproduction mechanisms, which suggests that p. lycopersici has undergone to a specialization and adaptation process during its evolution. the assembly presented constitutes an important resource to understand the molecular bases of corky root rot and more in general to enrich current knowledge of plant-pathogen interaction mechanisms.
