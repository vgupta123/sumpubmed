BACKGROUND
chlamydia are obligate intracellular bacteria known to infect not only humans, but also reptiles, amoebae, fish and mammals  <cit> . beside c. trachomatis and c. psittaci, c. pneumoniae  is the third chlamydial species with human pathogenic potential, showing the highest infection and seropositivity rates  amongst them at the age of  <dig> years  <cit> . while acute infections mainly affect the upper and lower respiratory tract and clinically impress as pharyngitis or pneumonia, chronic cpn infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . both are amongst the most widespread diseases of the elderly and are the first and fourth leading causes of death among the elderly in the industrialized world  <cit> .

genomic signatures of cpn can be reliably found in atherosclerotic plaques, but also in circulating blood monocytes from patients suffering from acute myocardial infarction  <cit> . although short-term antimicrobial treatment does not ameliorate cardiovascular disease progression in humans, data from numerous animal studies give supporting evidence that cpn can disseminate from the lung and infect the vasculature using peripheral blood monocytes   <cit> . only a few studies focusing on genomic differences between respiratory and vascular isolates have been published, none of them was using whole genome analysis of clinical isolates. thus, it was suggested that respiratory strains contain multiple copies of the tyrp gene; whereas, vascular strains contain only a single copy  <cit> . in contrast, cochrane et al. later described multiple cpn genotypes in atherosclerotic plaques of carotid endarterectomy specimens by sequencing the vd <dig> region of the ompa gene and a  <dig> nt fragment spanning the yged and urk genes  <cit> .

it was shown recently by harris et al., that whole-genome sequencing provides a more accurate scenario of the diversity of clinical c. trachomatis isolates than genotyping of single genes that are subject to recombination between different chlamydial biovars  <cit> . although most cpn genes are supposed to be less variable, specific regions in the genome baring the potential to vary by homologous recombination and slipped-mispair have been described  <cit> . at that time, however, the available sequence data were not yet sufficient to determine the actual contribution of recombination events to the evolution of cpn strains.

so far, the genomes of only four human pathogenic cpn have been sequenced  <cit> . all of them have been isolated from the respiratory tract. they show a high level of identity in their genome sequence and only few insertions and deletions  between isolates. we followed the strategy to perform whole-genome sequencing of selected respiratory and non-respiratory cpn isolates to reliably determine the occurrence of single nucleotide polymorphisms , indels and copy number variations  in comparison to the already published cpn genomes. we have selected isolates with widespread geographical distribution and sampled over a long period for sequencing, in order to define genomic markers that are most related to the anatomical origin of the respective cpn isolate.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
we selected cpn clinical isolates originating from different tissues and spanning a broad range of sampling times and locations as well as an animal isolate as a phylogenetic out-group. from  <dig> isolates, which were cultivated on hep- <dig> cells and sequenced in multiple runs on an illumina ga ii sequencer,  <dig> yielded a sufficient amount of reads for genome assembly . the fraction of chlamydial sequences in the total dna ranged from 4%  to 32% . only the gid isolate dna could be enriched to 99% chlamydial sequences.table  <dig>

the comparative assembly of the non-human reads of the sequenced isolates against the closest available complete reference sequence among the publicly available genomes of cpn produced between  <dig> and  <dig> contigs. at least  <dig> % of the corresponding reference genome was covered in all of the isolates . compared to the widely used strategy of mapping, comparative assembly also allows reconstructing highly variable regions of the genome, longer insertions and deletions as well as genome rearrangements. in order to examine the correctness of the assembly process, we compared the snps derived from our assemblies to results from an earlier study from rattei et al.  <cit> , in which selected chromosomal regions of the same cpn isolates have already been sequenced. the comparison indicates that  <dig> % of the snps identified in the previous study were successfully recovered in our current whole-genome assemblies . a test for heterozygous snps, which would have indicated different subpopulations, yielded no evidence for the presence of multiple genotypes in any of the isolates . along with these newly sequenced genomes we have also included the publicly available genomes of four clinical cpn isolates  and one koala isolate  into all subsequent comparative analyses.

genomic variation of cpn clinical isolates
a multiple whole genome alignment of all cpn clinical isolates served as backbone for comparative genomics. we determined a total of  <dig>  snp and  <dig> indel loci from the alignment . these findings indicate very low overall sequence diversity of all sequenced cpn clinical isolates and are in very good agreement with previous studies of selected genomic regions  <cit> . the strategy of whole genome sequencing and comparative assembly, however, revealed a more unequal distribution of variations in the genome. the genes with the highest density of snps and indels mostly encode ‘hypothetical proteins’ and in many cases contain both snps and indels  . variation frequency is generally highest in the intergenic regions .figure  <dig> 
variation genome circle. genome circle showing the distribution of variations distributed over the cpn genome. classification of snps is based on the cwl <dig> annotation.



taking the annotation of the cpn strain cwl <dig> as a reference, 47% of all snp loci  have at least one non-synonymous  exchange, 36%  are only synonymous , 14%  are located in intergenic regions and 3%  are in noncoding genes. approximately 75%  of the indels are located in coding sequences. already in previous studies an unexpectedly high number of non-synonymous snps  were particularly observed when human isolates were compared to non-human isolates  <cit> . it was hypothesized that zoonosis events would temporarily favor positive selection and a higher rate of non-synonymous substitutions, whereas negative selective pressure dominates after successful adaptation. to test this assumption, we calculated the ka/ks ratio of non-synonymous versus synonymous substitutions per gene. ka/ks ratios of the clinical isolates compared to the animal outgroup dc <dig>  were on average higher than the ratios among the clinical isolates . ka/ks ratios >  <dig> for  <dig> genes in the comparison to dc <dig> indicate that these genes were under positive selection during the adaptation to the human host. comparing only the genomes of clinical isolates, most genes have the expected ratios <<  <dig> of negative selective pressure. only four genes have ka/ks ratios >  <dig>  out of which three genes are ‘putative uncharacterized proteins’  while cpn_ <dig> is a ‘dipeptide transport system permease protein’. however, there are no indications that these genes are pseudogenes.

genome recombination has been proposed but could not be shown in cpn so far  <cit> . as our study significantly expands the number of cpn genome sequences, it is now feasible to address the question of recombination. from a multiple genome alignment also containing dc <dig> as closest representative of non-human isolates, we determined a total number of  <dig>  snp loci. a statistical phi test and a bayesian inference approach yielded significant evidence that recombination has occurred between the isolates . recombination was observed between human, but not between human and the non-human isolate . testing sliding windows along the genome alignment suggests two regions of recombination, one between the genomic positions  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb and the second between  <dig> mb and  <dig>  mb . the areas adjacent to the two regions of recombination did not show evidence for recombination. this suggests an exchange of dna within these two relatively short genomic regions. due to the limited number of snps the actual recombination sites cannot be determined more precisely. the first region contains  <dig> pmp-genes of which  <dig> are annotated as pseudogenes . the second region is enclosed by the operon of ribosomal rnas and three ribosomal proteins whereas the genes in between encode various different enzymes .figure  <dig>

evolution of the cpn clinical isolates
the newly sequenced genomes of  <dig> cpn isolates as well as the five publicly available cpn genomes represent the most comprehensive dataset for the reconstruction of the evolutionary history of human pathogenic cpn. we calculated a multiple genome alignment based on the  <dig> human cpn isolates . the two non-human isolates  were integrated as outgroups. from this alignment, we derived a total number of  <dig>  snp loci.

the most stable tree was obtained from all snp positions, including non-synonymous, synonymous, non-coding and intergenic loci . the tree shows a clear separation between outgroups, dc <dig> from frog and the koala isolate lpcoln, and the human isolates. the human isolates split up into three clusters, all supported by high bootstrap values. tw <dig> and uzg <dig> form one cluster that branches deeper in the tree than the other two human clusters. the isolates yk <dig>  ar <dig>  gid and j <dig> are contained in another cluster together with cm <dig>  which is located in a sister branch within this cluster. the long sub-branch of j <dig> can be mainly ascribed to a region between genomic positions  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig>  showing around  <dig> snps that are only present in j <dig>  in j <dig> no gene is annotated in this region, whereas it is marked as pseudogene cpb <dig> in tw <dig> and contains an annotated gene  in cwl <dig>  the third cluster contains three sub-groups, all of which are well supported by bootstrap values. the first group consists of h <dig>  panola and k7; the isolates u <dig>  cwl <dig>  cwl <dig> and cwl029c form the second group. the largest sub-group in the branch consists of the isolates wien <dig>  wien <dig>  mul <dig>  cv <dig>  wien <dig>  cv <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  inside this sub-group there are again three small groups, the first containing wien <dig> and wien <dig>  the second containing mul <dig> and cv <dig> and the third consisting of wien <dig>  cv <dig>  pb <dig> and pb <dig>  all of these three groups have good bootstrap support. overall, there is a remarkable congruence between the phylogenetic tree presented in this study and the phylogeny calculated from a set of selected snp positions reported in an earlier study from rattei et al.  <cit> , with our new phylogeny providing a much higher resolution of the cwl <dig> containing cluster. the topology of this tree, based on all snps, is also supported by trees based on subsets of snps, such as from  <dig> phylogenetic marker genes  and from  <dig> genes that represent the chlamydial pan-genome .figure  <dig>

distances in the new phylogenetic tree are generally in agreement with the number of snps between the different isolates but also with the number of indels between the isolates . whereas the snps were used to calculate the phylogenetic tree and therefore are expected to represent the topology, the indels are independent from the tree bust still show a similar distance pattern. in some cases, not only the numbers of indels, but also the contained sequences, show a pattern related to the snp phylogeny. e.g., the five vascular isolates pb <dig>  pb <dig>  cv <dig>  cv <dig> and wien <dig> have a deletion of ~ <dig> nt in the pmp_ <dig> gene, which is not present in any other isolate . in the phylogenetic tree, these five isolates form one sub-group in the branch of vascular isolates.figure  <dig>

although the low number of snps limits the phylogenetic reconstruction of specific genomic regions, we calculated phylogenetic trees from snps in all  <dig> kb regions in the recombination areas determined before. only a short  <dig> kb region between the genomic positions  <dig> kb and  <dig> kb revealed clear phylogenetic evidence for recombination between the isolates tw <dig> and uzg <dig> and the group of vascular isolates. additional file  <dig> shows the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree based on snps derived from this  <dig> kb region and an additional tree derived from the surrounding region. the isolates tw <dig> and uzg <dig> and the vascular isolates are located on the same branch of the tree based on the  <dig> kb region, but are clearly separated in the tree of the surrounding region, resembling the topology of the whole-genome based tree.

pathogen-related differences with respect to cpn tissue tropism
an earlier study indicated that respiratory strains of cpn clinical isolates contain multiple copies of the tyrp gene, whereas vascular strains contain a single copy  <cit> . in order to determine the tyrp copy number in the  <dig> newly sequenced genomes of human cpn isolates we mapped the sequenced reads specifically against the entire tyrp locus of cwl <dig>  containing two tyrp gene copies . we determined the tyrp copy number in each genome from the average sequencing depth of the tyrp locus compared to the upstream and downstream regions. one copy of the tyrp gene was observed in all vascular isolates, whereas the respiratory isolates vary between one  and two copies  . the varying tyrp copy numbers between several closely related isolates, e.g. in cwl029c and cwl <dig>  might represent intra-strain polymorphism which has been reported previously by gieffers et al.  <cit> . mitchell et al. already described in  <dig> that the respiratory isolate j <dig> and the conjunctival isolate tw <dig> contain only one tyrp copy and questioned the hypothesis that the tyrp copy number determines tissue tropism . we have found further non-vascular isolates having only a single tyrp gene . the homogenous presence of a single tyrp gene in vascular isolates therefore indicates the close phylogenetic relatedness between these isolates and might contribute to the tissue tropism in the connection with other predisposing genetic factors.table  <dig>

the presence of phages in various chlamydia genomes has been shown to be related with chlamydial infection and pathogenicity. hoestgaard-jensen et al. could show that ϕcpar <dig> expression resulted in t3s disruption and inca accumulation in the morphological abnormal chlamydial reticulate bodies   <cit> . searching the newly sequenced genomes yielded no evidence for phage-like sequences in any of the isolates of this study. neither mapping of the sequenced reads to known chlamydia phages, nor re-assembly of the non-human and non-chlamydia reads, nor the search for phage-related sequences in the indels, indicated the presence of phages. thus, we did not find any support that phage-related determinants are among the primary factors for tissue tropism. however, we cannot completely rule out that we missed phages in one or the other isolates as our genome sequencing methodology was not optimized for phage detection  <cit> .

high genomic similarity of isolates from same tissues was found earlier  <cit>  and points to specific genotypes that may determine cpn tissue tropism. we therefore assigned attributes characterizing the isolates to the corresponding leaf in the phylogenetic tree . table  <dig> presents: the type of tissue from which the isolate was sampled and is used as an identification mark for tropism in this study; the geographical location of the sampling; and the year of sampling. among these three attributes “tissue” mostly corresponds to the topology of the tree, whereas the others show weak  or no  correlation to the genotype. all vascular isolates  are located in one, monophyletic and short-branching part of the tree with only one respiratory isolate, mul <dig>  in between. it can, however, not be excluded that mul <dig> is potentially a vascular isolate that was just isolated in an early stage of infection. contrary to that, the attributes “location” and “year” do not show comparable agreement with the genotype. although vascular isolates were only available from two different countries, the sampling occurred in different years in which respiratory isolates also were collected. the remarkable agreement between the clusters formed by the attribute “tissue” and the topology of the tree suggest genotypic factors to be involved in the cpn tissue tropism.

since the phylogenetic tree showed a clear separation of respiratory and conjunctival from vascular isolates we determined the snp positions distinguishing the two groups. in total, nine locations that are characteristic for the type of the isolate  were found . these snps are all non-synonymous and located in genes involved in rb to eb transition, inclusion membrane formation, bacterial stress response and metabolism. for several of the genes, biological functions have already been elucidated that could have a direct impact on implementation of cpn infections under the prerequisite of different environmental conditions of the lung and the vasculature. for example, cpn_ <dig> regulates the uptake of glutamate that has been shown to stimulate growth of cpn but not c. trachomatis  <cit> . the glutamyl trna reductase  mediates the metabolism of phenylalanine that is involved in the extracellular protein synthesis of the transcription termination factor rho and the nudix phosphohydrolase in c. trachomatis, thereby mitigating cellular stress responses  <cit> . special focus should be given to the regulatory and stress response genes cpn_ <dig>  and cpn_ <dig>  to look for bacterial adaption mechanisms in different microenvironments. in terms of pathogenicity and intracellular host-pathogen interactions, further investigations on the transcriptional relevance of the nssnps in the incc gene  and the acyl-carrier udp-glcnac o-acyltransferase  are needed. to substantiate our findings, we checked these characteristic snps in additional two respiratory isolates from the us  and one additional respiratory  and vascular  isolate from germany. we sequenced the respective regions harboring the characteristic ssnps in cpn_ <dig>  cpn_ <dig> and cpn_ <dig>  the isolates grouped within the newly defined vascular and respiratory cluster, respectively .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
while acute cpn infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are frequently seen in clinics and seem to emerge in small endemic episodes, the relevance of cpn infections in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic vascular diseases is less clear. although experimental models support the hypothesis that cpn contributes to the development of atherosclerotic lesions by direct or indirect mechanisms  <cit> , clinical evidence is still missing. we were interested in the genetic background of clinical isolates from cpn that were derived from different anatomical origins. selection of isolates was motivated by the availability of re-cultivable strain preparations, clear documentation of the isolation source and the endeavor to obtain as large geographical distribution as possible. the only vascular strain a <dig>  <cit>  from the us we had access to was severely contaminated with mycoplasma and could not be re-cultivated. previous studies determined the genetic variation in cpn from selected snps  <cit>  or gene sequences  <cit>  rather than complete genomes due to the high sequencing costs at that time, which are particularly exacerbated by an unavoidable proportion of human dna in chlamydial samples. the recent progress in dna sequencing techniques makes it feasible to sequence a sufficient amount of dna to reconstruct entire genomes at low costs. in this study, we therefore applied the illumina technique to  <dig> cpn isolates. independent of our study, harris et al. recently pursued a similar approach to sequence  <dig> c. trachomatis genomes  <cit> , also based on next-generation sequencing. due to the shortness of the reads  and for some isolates the limited amount of sequence data, neither mapping to the cwl <dig> genome as a reference, nor de novo assembly allowed us to assemble complete genomes. to overcome this limitation, and in difference to the manual scaffolding used for c. trachomatis  <cit> , we applied a comparative assembly approach. it automatically combines mapping against a closely related reference genome and de novo assembly of regions that cannot be mapped to the reference. comparative assembly works the better the closer the reference genome fits the target genome. therefore, we selected the closest reference genome for each of our isolates individually. this special approach allowed us to assemble the complete genomes of six out of  <dig> isolates as well as genomes consisting of less than  <dig> contigs for a further nine isolates. the number of contigs for the four remaining isolates ranges between  <dig> and  <dig>  the quality of these assemblies was verified by comparison with previous genotyping, which indicated a very high accuracy of the obtained genome sequences. high quality of the detected variants was ensured by requiring a sufficient quality  and read coverage . a comparison to the genome of the cpn reference strain cwl <dig> yielded  <dig> snp loci as well as  <dig> indels, where all isolates have the same genotype except for cwl <dig> . these positions represent likely errors in the cwl <dig> reference genome and were not observed in the cwl029-labstrain cwl029c formerly obtained from atcc. our findings were additionally validated by sanger sequencing of the respective genomic loci.

we detected very low sequence diversity of the human cpn isolates and a much higher evolutionary distance of the animal isolates confirming results from previous studies  <cit> . however, the unmatched number of  <dig> complete cpn genome sequences allowed us to investigate the evolutionary relationships between cpn isolates at a novel resolution level. high bootstrap support in most parts of the phylogenetic tree underpins the statistical significance of our results. we found significant evidence of recombination between human cpn isolates and identified a region of  <dig> kb around the putative inca pseudogene cpn_ <dig>  that recombined between the cwl <dig> group, tw <dig> and uzg <dig>  thus, cpn shows in principle similar evolutionary mechanisms as c. trachomatis, in which recombination occurs to an even greater extent  <cit> . also, considering the overall number of snps as well as the snp distribution, we found that human cpn isolates show much less variation than human c. trachomatis isolates. earlier studies already pointed to an unexpectedly high nssnp/ssnp ratio, suggesting that also ssnps underlie selection in cpn genome evolution  <cit> . our genome-wide dataset allowed an unbiased, gene-wise determination of the selective pressure. remarkably, positive selective pressure  was found for four genes and suggests a relationship of these genes to host pathogenicity which requires fast adaptation. however, only for one of them a putative function  could be predicted. the variations in plasticity zones suggested by earlier studies  <cit>  were confirmed by our data; however, these are not in regions of particular high variability in our multi-genome alignments. although we recovered other candidates for highly variable regions in the cpn genomes, the existence of plasticity zones as observed in c. trachomatis  <cit>  remains questionable.

only a few studies directly addressed the question of genetic factors that are related to tissue tropism in cpn infections to date. the most extensive showed minor polymorphisms present in the variable domain  <dig>  region of the outer-membrane protein-a  gene and the intergenic region between the yged and uridine kinase  of cpn infecting human atherosclerotic carotid plaques  <cit> . the polymorphic outer membrane protein  genes have been suggested previously as a marker for intra-species variation of cpn, differentiating isolates by the size of their pcr product  <cit> . we observed not only a high number of recombination in the pmp genes in general but also a deletion of ~ <dig> nt in pmp <dig> in five of the vascular isolates, suggesting a central functional role of this highly variable region in chlamydial diseases  <cit> . for cpn it was shown that pmp <dig> acts as adhesin, is required for efficient intracellular infection and promotes nfκb- mediated pro- inflammatory signaling cascades in vascular endothelial cells  <cit> , linking pmp <dig> to the vascular pathogenesis of chlamydia.

our data indicate that multiple copies of tyrp are not a prerequisite for respiratory isolates, which is in contrast to previous publications  <cit> . on the other hand, all vascular isolates harbored only one single copy that could be a consequence of their close relatedness. a functional relevance, however, might exist in the context of persistence development. in this regard the isolate mul <dig>  that has been isolated from bronchoalveolar-lavage fluid  of a  <dig> year old male patient suffering from copd and chronic, non-productive cough, is of particular interest, as it expresses five out of the nine nssnps classified as “vascular genotype” and contains only one tyrp copy. to test the hypothesis whether polyclonal infections occur in vivo, it would require to subsequently genotype cpn from dna samples derived from respiratory samples and whole blood within short time after respiratory resolution of the respiratory symptoms  <cit>  like it was done before for c. trachomatis isolates from clinical swabs  <cit> . a particular focus should be given in further studies to the non-respiratory, non-vascular human pathogenic isolates. dean et al. could show in a trachoma-endemic area that infections with cpn were significantly associated with severe conjunctival inflammation overlapping with the clinical appearance of c. trachomatis induced trachoma  <cit> . however, only few cases of cpn induced conjunctivitis were reported so far  <cit>  so that re-cultivable isolates were not adequately represented in our study.

taken together, our data highlight for the first time genetic differences of clinical cpn isolates that are connected to the anatomical origin of cultivation. with novel technologies for genetic modification of chlamydia at hand, a detailed functional characterization of the different clinical isolates with respect to growth, extracellular survival, stress responsiveness and persistence induction is required. in addition, a clinical evaluation of atherosclerotic patients that is not based on the presence of anti-chlamydial antibodies but on the genetic background of the respective clinical isolate could foster our understanding of the pathophysiological relevance of cpn infections in these patients and help to optimize diagnostic tools for the identification of vascular infections.
