BACKGROUND
plant invasions have received attention on a global scale. invasive plants have caused great economic harm, biodiversity loss, environmental problems, and even human and animal health issues  <cit> . currently, methods to control invasive plants have been widely investigated and practiced, including mechanical , chemical  <cit>  and biological control . however, mechanical measures may potentially accelerate invasions  <cit> , chemical measures can be detrimental to non-target species and environment health , and traditional biological control measures via introduction of pathogens, parasites, and predators against invaders are expensive and pose risks to ecosystem integrity  <cit> . thus, as a potential alternative to traditional biological control which generally employs insects or pathogens, replacement control relies on growth characteristics of one or more plants to suppress exotic plants, simultaneously reducing damage caused by the invasive species and improving local natural ecosystem health by reducing the potential for invasive plants to spread beyond agricultural fields. adoption of this alternative method has received considerable attention in recent years .

mikania micrantha h.b.k. is a rapidly-growing perennial creeping vine belonging to the family asteraceae native to central and south america  <cit> . the vine has been listed among the top  <dig> worst invasive species  <cit>  and as one of the top  <dig> worst weeds in the world  <cit> . m. micrantha is present in tropical asia, parts of papua new guinea, indian ocean islands, pacific ocean islands, and florida in the us  <cit> . it has colonized a broad range of farming systems and forest lands, banks of streams and rivers, roadsides and railway tracks, pastures, and open disturbed areas  <cit> , leading to serious economic loss, biodiversity loss and negative environmental impacts  <cit> .

to explore ecological methods for managing m. micrantha, biological control measures through replacement control with high value species  have been investigated . in  <dig> and  <dig>  sweet potato , an important locally grown cash crop native to the american tropics, was observed to inhibit m. micrantha growth in longchuan county of yunnan province, china in sweet potato fields where m. micrantha occurred  <cit> . subsequent studies examined the effects of a local crop, sweet potato, on m. micrantha growth and soil nutrients  <cit> . sweet potato exhibited greater competitive ability than m. micrantha, with plant height, branch, leaf, stem node, adventitious root, and biomass of m. micrantha suppressed significantly; furthermore sweet potato also demonstrated higher levels of nutrient uptake than m. micrantha. moreover, flowering of m. micrantha was significantly suppressed in mixed culture with sweet potato and with decreasing proportions of m. micrantha, the competitiveness of sweet potato increased at a rate exceeding what would be predicted by the increase in relative density  <cit> . however, no literature is available on the effects of sweet potato competition on the entire suite of reproductive characteristics of m. micrantha.

building on our former studies  <cit> , the present research examined how sweet potato suppressed reproductive characteristics of m. micrantha in yunnan province, china. previous reports did not refer to impacts on reproductive characteristics, so this is the first report of how sweet potato competition affects characteristics such as flowering and seed production in m. micrantha. these findings are important to further elucidate the competitive interaction and mechanisms between sweet potato and m. micrantha and provide insights for similar ecological control methods that could be applied to other invasive alien species.

methods
study site
the study site was located in longchuan county , in the western end of yunnan province, southwest china. this area is characterized by a typical tropical climate, having a rainy season featuring heavy rainfall with 90 % relative humidity alternating with a dry season  <cit> . rainfall averages 15450 mm per year and the annual mean temperature is  <dig>  °c. recently, the range of m. micrantha has been expanding rapidly within longchuan county, as the plant has invaded agricultural areas and forest margins  <cit> .

study species
mikania micrantha is one of the most serious invasive species in longchuan county where this study took place. this perennial weed exhibits a climbing growth form in forests, orchards and shrublands, but on roadsides, in open wasteland areas without crops, and other areas without woody vegetation, it takes on a prostrate form. it has infested sugarcane, orange, banana, coffee, pineapple, bamboo, sweet potato, maize crops, as well as artificial pasture and secondary forest in the study area  <cit> . m. micrantha can invade disturbed environments via light weight wind-dispersed seeds that are produced in great numbers, as high as  <dig>  m− <dig>  <cit> . at a local level, vegetative reproduction is responsible for most population growth as facilitated by rooting of stem fragments  <cit> .

sweet potato, native to the american tropics, is one of the main food and cash crops in tropical and subtropical regions of yunnan province. it is also grown in many other regions of china and other subtropical or warm-temperate regions of the world as a food source. in longchuan county, local villagers have grown it for over 100 years  <cit> . this herbaceous perennial vine usually exhibits a prostrate growth form in agricultural areas, so its niche is similar to that of m. micrantha. because of its purple root, it is also known as purple sweet potato. the aboveground parts of the plant are used for livestock fodder and its roots are used for human eating. it is propagated by seed or by clonal means, with 20–50 cm fragments with 3– <dig> nodes typically planted  <cit> .

experiment design and data collection
the experiments were conducted during the may, 2014-october, 2015 growing season within maize and sweet potato intercropping land in the vicinity of zhangfeng town, longchuan county, utilizing a de wit replacement series method  <cit> . on  <dig> may  <dig>  whole m. micrantha plants  were collected from a m. micrantha population located in a nearby forest margin and whole sweet potato plants were collected from farmland, respectively. to ensure relative uniformity among the experimental stock, one-node segments  were taken from central stem portions of relatively young plants of similar size from both species. the segments were placed in hoagland’s solution  <cit>  and grown for 10 days. on  <dig> may  <dig>  the sprouts derived from cuttings of both species were transplanted in the field test plots. six ratios of sweet potato and m. micrantha plants were utilized  while maintaining a constant planting density of  <dig> plants m− <dig> . all plots were arranged in a complete randomized design with  <dig> replicates utilizing 25 m <dig> plots . all sweet potato and m. micrantha plants were distributed evenly within the plot. during the experiment, the two species exhibited prostrate growth. the plots were not weeded and no fertilizers were used.

from october  <dig> to february  <dig>  flowering and fruiting phenology were recorded at 3 days intervals for m. micrantha, including the dates of initial and last budding, flowering, fruiting and seed set. during peak flowering times, we marked  <dig> inflorescences of m. micrantha in each plot and recorded the number of flower visits per insect visitor on each inflorescence between 9: <dig> and 18: <dig>  for two continuous days with all plots monitored simultaneously over the same two days. according to  <cit>  each flower visitor was classified as belonging to apidae, calliphoridae, syrphidae , or another pollinator group beyond these three taxa. at the same time, twenty plants of each species were selected randomly and harvested within the middle region of each plot. m. micrantha plants were carefully removed and separated, and number of inflorescences and flowers were recorded. the fresh weight of inflorescences and flowers and total biomass of each m. micrantha plant were measured. on  <dig> january  <dig>  seed production of m. micrantha was measured in the study plots after flowering had waned, but prior to seed dispersal. another twenty plants of each species were selected randomly and harvested within the middle region of each plot. the number, size  and dry weight of m. micrantha seeds were measured. sixty days later, germination rates of m. micrantha seeds from each plot were tested in the laboratory.

during the spring, summer and fall of  <dig> , four small quadrats  were selected randomly and marked in each plot. seedlings were identified as either produced from germinating seeds  or vegetative growth . the number of new sexual and asexual m. micrantha seedlings was monitored in each quadrat monthly. we did not remove the seedlings that were counted but rather kept track of the total that emerged through the season, month by month. seedling mortality was also recorded for the m. micrantha that emerged.

data analyses
reproductive characteristics of m. micrantha  <cit>  were calculated in each plot with the following parameters:  reproductive allocation  = inflorescence biomass/total biomass of each plant,  reproductive investment  = flower biomass/total biomass of each plant,  reproductive index  = flower biomass/inflorescence biomass of each plant,  reproductive ratio  = flower number/inflorescence biomass of each plant and  reproductive efficiency index  = flower number/total biomass of each plant.

all growth variables  of m. micrantha plants were analyzed by analysis of variance  using ibm spss  <dig>  software. if significant differences were detected with the anova, tukey’s hsd, post hoc multiple comparisons, homogeneity of variance tests were used to detect differences among treatments at a 5 % level of significance.

discussion
our research showed that the biomass, flowering, seed and seedling characteristics of m. micrantha were reduced when grown in association with sweet potato. a previous study showed that plant height, branch, leaf, stem node, adventitious root, and biomass of m. micrantha were suppressed significantly by sweet potato competition  <cit> . the present study found that the biomass of plant, inflorescences, flowers, and seeds of m. micrantha were also significantly suppressed with increasing proportions of sweet potato. moreover, with decreasing number and biomass of inflorescences and flowers, the reproductive allocation, reproductive investment and reproductive index of m. micrantha were also significantly reduced. the net result of the presence of sweet potato was reduced reproductive potential of m. micrantha and like other invasive species, its reproductive ability, including flowering characteristics, seed dispersal and seed germination parameters, is associated with its invasiveness .

flowering phenology is affected by number, timing and duration of flowers  <cit> . these factors are not only constrained by genetics and phylogeny, but also affected by environmental conditions, such as sunlight, temperature, nutrients, and competition  <cit> . the present study found that flowering phenology of m. micrantha was significantly delayed, duration of flowering and fruiting was significantly reduced and duration of bud formation was markedly increased with increased sweet potato proportions.

along with reduced biomass and delayed flowering, another major factor reducing reproductive output in m. micrantha observed in our study was the negative impact of sweet potato on pollinator visitation. m. micrantha depends on insects for sexual reproduction as it is self-incompatible  <cit> . for insect-pollinated plant species, competition for pollinators may lead to changes in visitation frequency or pollinator composition  and consequently, a lowered reproductive output  <cit> . in this study, species of apidae , calliphoridae , and syrphidae  were the most abundant visitors to m. micrantha flowers and were observed to have the longest foraging time of all floral visitors, which is consistent with the results of other studies  <cit> . overall flower visits of apidae, calliphoridae and syrphidae per inflorescence were reduced significantly with increasing proportions of sweet potato. from october to february in the study area, the temperature gradually became lower and the delayed flowering phenology of m. micrantha corresponded with reduced insect activity. moreover, in mixed culture, 70–90 % of m. micrantha stems and leaves were covered by sweet potato  <cit> , thus reducing insect visitation via diminished visibility of m. micrantha flowers. because flowering in both sweet potato and m. micrantha occurs at virtually the same time, pollinators visited both species during the monitoring period; however, because the number of flowers per shoot was at least  <dig> times greater for m. micrantha than sweet potato  <cit> , the main influence on pollinator visitation was m. micrantha flower number. m. micrantha can produce a large number of flowers and small, light, and wind-dispersed seeds  <cit> . the negative correlation we observed between seed set and pollinator visitation in m. micrantha is consistent with the commonly observed link between pollinator visitation rate and seed set  <cit> .

nutrient availability also influences reproductive output by m. micrantha, with fewer flowers, lower seed setting percentage, lower 1000-grain weight and shorter flowering duration observed in plants growing in nutrient-deficient soils with suboptimal fertility, but soils with an overabundance of nutrients  also resulted in fewer flowers and low seed set  <cit> . meanwhile, plants growing in an open habitat had more flowers with longer flowering duration, and under shade the 1000-grain weight was shown to have a slight increase, but light that was too bright or too dim was not conducive to seed set  <cit> . light was found to affect fruiting; for example, a photoperiod of 12 h/day resulted in  <dig>  % of flowers producing fruit  <cit> . the present study found that the number, biomass, length, set rate, germination rate, and 1000-grain dry weight of m. micrantha seeds was significantly suppressed with decreasing proportions of m. micrantha. this is because m. micrantha plants covered by dense carpets of sweet potato received fewer pollinator visits and produced fewer seeds. furthermore, sweet potato exhibited greater absorption of soil nutrients than m. micrantha  <cit> ; the resulting lack of nutrients likely lead to reduced 1000-grain weight and germination rate of m. micrantha in the presence of sweet potato.

the potential for high levels of sexual and/or vegetative reproduction by m. micrantha is formidable  <cit> . it has transient soil seed bank and persistent soil seed bank, and some seeds would germinate given ideal germination conditions such as season, temperature, moisture; otherwise the seeds would remain dormant  <cit> . large numbers of seeds of m. micrantha were concentrated primarily in the 0–5 cm soil layer, which contained 98 % of the total seeds present in the soil  <cit> . vegetative propagation of m. micrantha from stem fragments that root easily at the nodes and from vegetative ramets arising from rosettes can be considered at least as important as reproduction by seeds  <cit> . the seedling is the most vulnerable stage in the life history of m. micrantha and seedlings suffer a high level of mortality under natural conditions  <cit> . the present study found that with proportional increases in sweet potato, both sexual and asexual seedling populations of m. micrantha were significantly suppressed, corresponding to increased mortality with increasing levels of sweet potato competition. thus, the best time to control m. micrantha is during the seedling period and control measures should be comprehensive involving both herbicides and appropriate cultural techniques  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the competitive advantage of sweet potato over m. micrantha could be used to reduce m. micrantha growth and reproductive ability in tropical and subtropical agricultural regions suitable for cultivation of sweet potato. both plants have similar growth forms and climatic requirements, and sweet potato is a high value crop, and thus we recommend planting sweet potato in areas infested by m. micrantha, perhaps as part of a rotation involving more vulnerable crops. sweet potato could even be planted in habitats such as waste areas not currently cultivated in order to reduce m. micrantha populations. our results showed that various components of reproduction for m. micrantha were significantly reduced by suppression of plant growth; the original data is available online  <cit> . flowering phenology was impacted by sweet potato competition, and delayed flowering phenology, reduced duration of flowering and fruiting and increased duration of bud formation resulted in reduced pollinator visits and seed set for m. micrantha. finally, high cover of sweet potato shading m. micrantha plants also reduced pollinator visits, seeds number, and seedling populations of m. micrantha. thus the mechanism by which sweet potato reduced sexual reproduction in m. micrantha was essentially twofold: causing a delay in flowering phenology and reducing pollinator visits. in addition to utilizing sweet potato, research in this study and other recent studies revealed that control of m. micrantha ideally should take place during the seedling period when m. micrantha is most vulnerable and should be comprehensive for optimal results, employing both chemical and cultural control. thus in the case of our study region in southern asia, the most effective timing of control is in the peak of sexual seedling emergence in may–june. the potential for utilizing a crop like sweet potato to compete with an invasive plant may well apply to many other agronomic settings where other management techniques  are unreliable or are associated with environmental concerns. the scenario of controlling m. micrantha by utilizing a crop with a similar growth form may provide a useful model for similar management strategies in other systems.
