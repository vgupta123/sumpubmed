BACKGROUND
methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus  infections rates have been increasing rapidly worldwide over the past few decades  <cit> . mrsa is currently endemic in many hospitals in several countries  <cit> . according to a sentry study, in brazil, the rates of mrsa infections are ~30 % and s. aureus is responsible for ∼ 20 % of nosocomial primary bloodstream infections   <cit> . mrsa is an important cause of surgical infection in liver transplantation patients, increased duration of hospitalization, costs, morbidity and mortality  <cit> . therefore, it is of great importance to understand the epidemiology of mrsa in this population of patients.

cirrhotic patients are more frequently colonized by mrsa than the general population and the burden of infectious diseases pre and post liver transplantation is clearly attributable to the dysfunction of defensive mechanisms of the host, because of cirrhosis, as well as because of the use of immunosuppressive agents  <cit> . several virulence factors present in s. aureus that allow the adherence, colonization and ability to invade tissues can increase the pathogenicity of this microorganism, among them the panton-valentine leucocidin , a toxin that can be able to make pores in the polymorphonuclear cells  <cit> . however, studies of virulence of mrsa in cirrhotic and liver transplantation patients are scarce.

molecular methods such as the characterization of staphylococcal chromosome cassette mec  by polymerase chain reaction , multi locus sequence typing , pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and staphylococcus protein a  typing had been developed to evaluate mrsa isolates and to develop strategies to control and prevent colonization and infection. sccmec typing is a rapid and easy technique essential for understanding the molecular epidemiology of mrsa  <cit> .

another widely used tool is pfge that has an excellent discriminatory power and is very useful for epidemiological studies although it is a laborious and time consuming technique  <cit> . spa typing is a more recent method based on sequencing the polymorphic region x or short-sequence repeat  region of the gene spa. changes in the ssr region arise due to deletions, duplications and point mutations, which results in a diverse collection of ‘spa types’, where each spa type consists of a specific combination of ssrs  <cit> . spa typing has been shown to be useful not only for investigation of hospital outbreaks but also for studies of molecular evolution of mrsa  <cit> . the major advantages of spa typing include it is fast, easy to use, has unambiguous data interpretation and has a standard nomenclature database.

some studies observed a high concordance between spa types and pfge epidemic clones  <cit> . golding and colleagues showed that the same spa types correspond to multiple pfge epidemic clones and require additional molecular typing to discriminate them. these authors proposed the use of panton-valentine leukocidin and sccmec typing to differentiate between mrsa isolates that shared the same spa type but presented multiple pfge epidemic types  <cit> . however, pvl characterization was not able to differentiate between isolates associated with multiple pfge epidemic types, although it can be used as a general indicator of pfge epidemic type.

the aim of this study was to compare the use of molecular methods  to characterize mrsa isolates that colonized and causing infection in patients before  and after liver transplantation.

RESULTS
study population
one-hundred and twenty-six outpatients with liver diseases on list waiting for liver transplantation and  <dig> liver-transplanted patients were evaluated. according to chart reviews and the questionnaire applied to the  <dig> listed patients, all patients of list transplantation reported go to the hospital at least once a month for doctor visits or routine tests since the discovery of the disease. furthermore,  <dig>  reported have been hospitalized in the previous 6 months. in addition,  <dig>  patients reported previous use of antimicrobials,  <dig>  reported not having used any antimicrobial previously and  <dig>  did not remember about the use of these drugs in the last 6 months. all liver-transplanted patients had a 48-hour course of ampicillin plus cefotaxime as antimicrobial prophylaxis and received tacrolimus and steroid as imunossuprevise therapy. those that developed kidney failure had the therapy replaced by adjusted doses of tacrolimus plus mycophenolate mofetil  and steroid.

demographic and clinical data of the study population is shown in table  <dig>  sixteen patients of the  <dig> listed outpatients  and  <dig> of the  <dig> liver-transplanted patients  were colonized by mrsa . fourteen patients of list of waiting for liver transplantation were transplanted during the study and were included between the  <dig> liver-transplanted patients. among then, two were colonization in pre and post transplantation period and three were colonization only in post transplantation period.table  <dig> clinical and demographic characteristics of  <dig> patients before and after liver transplantation undergoing screening for methicillin-resistant s. aureus

among  <dig> liver transplanted patients, five had infections by mrsa , three of them evoluted to death. between them, three patients were colonized in post transplantation period and two patients were colonized in pre and post transplantation period. only one patient with pneumonia had the same cluster ny/jp in colonization and infection. twenty-eight  liver transplanted patients received steroid plus tacrolimus and  <dig>  mmf plus steroid and tacrolimus as immunosuppressive therapy, mrsa colonization was respectively  <dig> of  <dig>  and  <dig> of  <dig>  patients , data of four patients were not available.

isolates
forty-three isolates from  <dig> patients were identified as mrsa. all isolates were positive for the meca and coa genes. all isolates were epidemiologically defined as ha-mrsa.

only one isolate per patient was selected for further molecular typing. when patients had mrsa isolates from the both sites with the same pfge, the nasal mrsa isolate was choose for next steps. furthermore, one patient showed two phenotypically different mrsa isolates from the same site and both isolates were included on the study. two patients were positives only in groin and these isolates were evaluated as well.

a total of  <dig> isolates were selected for further molecular typing, which included  <dig> isolates from patients of the liver-transplant waiting list and  <dig> isolates from liver-transplanted patients.

sccmec and virulence factors
among the mrsa isolates,  <dig>  carried sccmec i,  <dig>  sccmec ii,  <dig>  sccmec iii and  <dig>  sccmec iva. sccmec types that are generally associated with nosocomial infections  were identified in 91 % of the ha-mrsa isolates. of these, sccmec type ii was the most prevalent type. none of the isolates carried pvl, adhesion factors such as exfoliating a, b  and fibrinogen binding protein . three mrsa isolates carried the tst gene, all isolates were characterized as sccmec type i, belonged to cluster e and t <dig> and were isolated from one cirrhotic patient and two liver-transplanted patients. none of patients carrying tst isolates developed infections.

spa typing
spa typing of the  <dig> tested mrsa isolates revealed nine known spa types  and one isolate from a cirrhotic patient was characterized as a new spa type t <dig>  this new spa type presented the following ssr: , its present a deletion of repeat and a replacement of r <dig> by r <dig> comparing t <dig>  and was closely related to t <dig> with a replacement of r <dig> by r <dig>  of these  <dig> spa types, t <dig> was the most common, representing  <dig>  % of all isolates.

pfge
to define the pulsed-field types  obtained by pfge, two cutoff levels were considered: >80 % to define types and 80–95 % to define subtypes. the types were represented by capital letters and subtypes by numbers. between the  <dig> mrsa isolates,  <dig> pfge types and  <dig> pfge subtypes were identified. the dendrogram revealed that  <dig>  mrsa isolates belonged to a major cluster, the pft a, which was related with the representative new york/japan epidemic clone  bk <dig>  this predominant cloned was identified in cirrhotic outpatients  and in post-transplantation patients  and distributed over a year period . other smaller clusters were noted . the representative brazilian epidemic clone  hsj <dig> was related with  <dig>  mrsa isolates with pft f, all them carried the same spa type and sccmec type  and were from post transplantation patients. the dendrogram, sccmec, spa type and pft were represented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> molecular characteristics of  <dig> mrsa isolates of cirrhotic and liver transplanted patients from august  <dig> to december  <dig>

discussion
previous studies have shown that mrsa colonization in cirrhotic patients varies from  <dig> to 28 % and that mrsa colonization can be associated with a high risk for infection in post liver transplantation patients . in spite of this, few studies evaluated the molecular characterization of mrsa in liver transplantation patients, most of them described outbreaks, only pvl was evaluated among the virulence factors, and no study compared pfge with spa typing . to our knowledge, this is the first prospective study of molecular characterization of mrsa isolates in patients before and after liver transplantation.

mrsa decolonization has been recommending pre surgery in high risk patients such as cardiac and orthopedic patients. however, data in liver transplantation is scarce; most of studies of mrsa carriage in post liver transplanted patients were retrospective, evaluated only nares  <cit>  and the efficacy of pre surgery decolonization need to be better addressed. in our study, a high proportion of swabbed patients were colonized with mrsa, and nares were the most frequent site of colonization. we did not identify outbreak due to mrsa in our hospital during the study period which might impact the colonization rates, however, mrsa screening is not performed as routine in the high risk patients such as intensive care patients, thus, mrsa colonization was underreported.

a previous study also showed that  <dig> nares  were more positives than rectal cultures . based on our results it seems that there is no need to collected cultures of other sites besides nares to screening mrsa in cirrhotic or liver transplanted patient. although not significant, in our study liver transplanted patients were more likely to be colonized by mrsa than cirrhotic patients . thirty-three percent of the mrsa isolates were from transplanted patients and 17 % of isolates were from cirrhotic patients. however, only three patients colonized developed infection due to mrsa post-transplantation, and one patient presented the same cluster ny/jpn in colonization and infection. in contrast, during the period of this study, there were outbreaks by gram-negative bacteria in the liver transplantation unit of our hospital  <cit> . interesting, none of patients colonized with mrsa harboring tst gene developed infections. it seems that the high rate of mrsa colonization did not increase the rate of infection.

regarding the molecular typing data we identified nine different pulsed field types . the cluster a was predominant  and related to the ny/jpn clone and present in cirrhotic and liver transplanted patients. only  <dig>  % of mrsa isolates belonged to bec that was identified only in post transplanted patients. nine known spa types and a new spa typing  were identified. among them, spa type t <dig> was the most frequent, six spa types were associated with the new york/japan clone  and the spa type t <dig> was associated with bec. these data was similar with studies that showed that in the last decade, the new york/japan clone was highly prevalent in many brazilian hospitals . in contrast until  <dig>  mrsa isolates sccmec iva  and sccmec type iii belonged to and the brazilian endemic clonal complex   were predominant in our hospital  <cit> . however, since  <dig>  there was a switched of pattern in our hospital, mrsa isolates sccmec ii  with characteristics of ny/jpn clone were predominant instead of mrsa isolates belonged to bec that represent only 10 % of isolates  <cit> .

in our study, none of mrsa isolates associated with the ny/jpn clone carry tst gene and 92 % harbored sccmec ii . interestingly, all mrsa isolates with tst gene carried the same spa type and sccmec  but belonged to the different pft e and differ from japanase studies  <cit> . the major mrsa distributed among japanese hospitals is new york / japan clone with sccmec ii and generally carries the tst gene  <cit> . however, american studies showed that isolates of mrsa usa <dig>  harbor sccmec ii and rarely carry tst gene . in view of these results, our mrsa isolates belonged to ny/jpn clone seen be more similar to the usa <dig> mrsa isolates.

in the present study, only  <dig>  isolates showed a pattern closely related to the bec. all of them had the same spa type  and sccmec type iii. about the virulence profile, one isolate did not have the same pattern of virulence than otherisolates. although there are few studies with spa typing in brazil, our findings are similar to other brazilian studies that also found that mrsa isolates t037-sccmec iii were strongly related with brazilian epidemic clone  <cit> . on the other hand, a new spa type t <dig> was identified in our study in a cirrhotic patient as well as  <dig> spa types t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig>  t <dig> e t <dig> that were identified for the first time in brazil.

this study has several limitations such as it was performed in only one center, the low number of mrsa infection in the post liver transplantation patients did not allow us to compare the virulence among colonization and infection strains and to conduct an intervention study with decolonization with mupirocin and chlorhexidine bath. unfortunately, we could not perform mlst for all isolates. however, among the sts identified in our study, st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig> and st <dig> had already been reported in brazil , including studies in our hospital  <cit> . nevertheless it was the first description of st <dig> in brazil.

in this study, pfge had a greater discriminatory power than spa typing. furthermore, isolates within the same pfge cluster had different spa types. golding and colleagues  <cit>  developed a large study in canada with mrsa isolates and showed that spa types were not limited to a specific pfge pattern, and that indistinguishable pfge patterns could be of different spa types. these authors made a more detailed analysis of ssr based on the degree of similarity of spa types, and showed six-spa clonal complexes that were related to specific epidemic clones. thus, it is possible to suggest that further studies on the similarity between the ssr are needed to establish a more reliable correlation between pfge patterns  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a high proportion of patients were colonized with mrsa and nares were the most frequent site of colonization. liver-transplantation patients were more frequently colonized by mrsa than cirrhotic patients. sccmec type ii was the most frequent sccmec, and the predominant clone was related to the ny/jpn cluster. pfge showed a greater discriminatory power than spa typing. we identified a new spa t <dig> and spa types and st never reported in brazil.
