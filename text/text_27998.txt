BACKGROUND
insecticides are used to control the insects affecting the agricultural crops, parasitizing livestock, as well as to eradicate the pests transmitting dangerous infectious diseases. however, frequent application of insecticides has resulted in the resurgence of pests and appearance of resistant pest species. insecticide resistance is the heritable change in the sensitivity of a pest population that is reflected in the repeated failure of a product  to achieve the expected level of control when used according to the level of recommendation for that pest species  <cit> . several studies have indicated the involvement of multiple genes in conferring the resistance to many insect species . thus, characterization of these genes is useful to understand the development of resistance and designing new strategies to minimize the development of insecticide resistance  <cit> .

three major mechanisms are involved in insecticide resistance  <cit> :  detoxification of insecticides through alteration in the activities of enzymes like esterase, oxidases or glutathione s-transferases  that prevents the insecticide from reaching to its site of action ,  insensitivity of the insecticide target proteins  <cit> , because of which the insecticide no longer binds to its target  <cit>  and  reduction in insecticide uptake due to decrease in permeability of insect cuticle  <cit> . though there is evidence of alteration in cuticular penetration, most of the studies have focused and evaluated the target site insensitivity and detoxification of insecticides  mechanisms. moreover, these two mechanisms have been reported to cover a wide range of resistance levels to almost all available insecticides  <cit> .

the cytochrome p <dig> family of genes in insect play an important role in the detoxification of insecticides resulted in the development of resistance to insecticides  <cit> . besides, gsts have also been reported to be involved in the detoxification of insecticides  <cit> . as far as target-based mechanism is concerned, there are three main targets for conventional insecticides viz., gaba -gated chloride ion channel, voltage-gated ion channel and acetylcholinesterases  <cit> . the gaba receptor is the site of target for cyclodiene  insecticides  <cit> , where the resistance to dieldrin  is conferred by the change of a single amino acid in gaba-gated chloride ion channel encoded by rdl gene  <cit> . further, knockdown resistance  is one of the major forms of resistance to ddt and pyrethroid insecticides  <cit> , which is associated with mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel . acetylcholinesterase  in nerve synapses is the target protein for the insecticides like organophosphorus  and carbamate   <cit> . the point mutation in the insecticide-binding site of ache has been identified as the cause of insensitivity to these insecticides  <cit> .

the above mentioned works help enable to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in the insecticide resistance. further, the analysis of bio-molecules involved in this phenomenon has confirmed the importance of single genes in target site resistance and involvement of multi-gene families like cytochrome p <dig> in metabolic resistance  <cit> . several studies on the effects of mutational changes in target proteins on insecticide resistance aid to the knowledge on the insect proteins involved in this process. for instance, riveron et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the single amino acid change  in an up regulated gst gene, gste <dig>  confers high level of metabolic resistance to ddt in the malaria vector anopheles funestus. in another study, nwane et al.  <cit>  identified that two mutations at position  <dig> of the s <dig> transmembrane segment of domain ii in the voltage gated sodium channel i.e., leucine to a phenylalanine  or to a serine  confers resistance to ddt and pyrethroid insecticides in anopheles gambiae. in the recent past, several studies have identified species-specific insecticide resistant genes through transcriptome and expression profile analysis. hsu et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> p <dig>   <dig> gst,  <dig> coe-related genes in bactrocera doralis, representing three major enzyme families involved in insecticide metabolism and resistance. in another study,  <dig> p <dig>   <dig> gst and  <dig> ces-specific genes of liposcelis bostrychophila were reported to be involved in insecticide resistance, through transcriptome and differential gene expression analysis  <cit> . recently, cui et al.  <cit>  identified relevant genes in response to flubendiamide insecticide in asian corn borer , through de novo transcriptome and expression-profile analysis.

though the transcriptome and expression profile analysis is one way of identifying the resistance genes, it is species specific. moreover the expression profile analysis is expensive as well as time consuming. thus, development of a computational tool for identifying the resistant genes independent of the species and economically as well would help in augmenting the research related to the identification of insecticide resistant genes. however, no computational tool is reported till date for the discrimination of insecticide resistant proteins from the proteins that do not confer resistance. keeping this in view, we propose a computational approach to discriminate the insecticide resistant proteins from non-resistant proteins. the developed computational approach can be used for identification of the resistant proteins across species as well as with minimum resource . we have also developed an online prediction server that can be easily used by experimental scientist and researchers to predict an unknown protein sequence as either insecticide-resistant or non-resistant protein. moreover, computational identification of insecticide resistant proteins will supplement the efforts needed to develop insecticides in targeting the resistance proteins.

methods
collection and processing of data
in this study, protein sequences corresponding to four important groups of insecticide resistant genes viz., cytochrome p <dig>  kdr, rdl and ache were collected from insecticide resistance gene database . we considered these four categories of genes because they represent important families of insecticide resistant genes which are resistant to commonly used insecticides. besides, the resistant protein sequences were reported to be involved in two important resistance mechanisms viz., detoxification-based and target-based. further, target-based resistant proteins are confined to three main targets of insecticides i.e., ache, gaba-gated chloride ion channel and voltage-gated sodium channel. a total of  <dig> sequences  belonging to  <dig> insect species  were collected. initially, we removed the sequences having non-standard residues. then, four positive sets having  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sequences were prepared, where the maximum pair-wise sequence identities were 40%, 60%, 70% and 90% respectively. the sequences with more than considered level of pair-wise sequence identity were removed using cdhit  <cit> . for negative set, protein sequences  of the considered species were collected from the uniprot  database. for the species acyrthosiphon pisum and tribolium castaneum, only the reviewed sequences were collected, as large number of sequence are present in uniprot for these two species. on the other hand, all the sequences available for remaining nine species were collected. after removing the sequences having non-standard residues as well as the identical sequences, a total of  <dig> sequences were obtained. further, to avoid homologous bias in the negative dataset, sequences with >40% pair-wise identity were removed using cdhit. finally a dataset with  <dig> sequences was obtained and considered as the negative dataset.

feature generation
protein sequences are the strings of amino acid residues, and hence they need to be mapped onto numeric feature vectors before being used as input in machine learning classifier. in this study, amino acid composition , di-peptide composition , pseudo amino acid composition , composition-transition-distribution  and auto correlation function  were used to transform the protein sequences into numeric feature vectors.

amino acid composition 
aac is a basic feature of protein sequence  <cit> , which is closely associated with its attributes, such as sub-cellular location  <cit> , secondary structure content  <cit>  and domain  <cit> . aac consists of  <dig> discrete numbers, each of which represents the frequency of the native amino acids in a protein sequence. based on the aac, each protein sequence was encoded into a 20-dimensional numerical vector.

di-peptide composition 
one of the limitations of aac is that it does not take into account the local order information of amino acids in the protein. on the other hand, dpc, which gives a fixed pattern length of  <dig> , encapsulates the global information about each protein sequence and the order it contains  <cit> . for any di-peptide, its composition was computed as the ratio of the frequency of that di-peptide to the total number possible di-peptide in the protein sequence.

pseudo amino acid composition 
the concept of paac was originally introduced by chou  <cit>  for predicting the protein sub-cellular locations and membrane protein types. based on the conventional aac, chou proposed a set of discrete numbers to take into account the sequence order effects. paac has been proven to be an extremely effective feature in many proteins and protein-related systems  <cit> . the paac for each protein sequence can be represented by a -dimensional vector for d-tier correlation factor. here, the paac was extracted for 1st-tier correlation only, by which each sequence was transformed into a 21-dimensional numeric vector. for further details, one can refer to  <cit> .

composition-transition-distribution 
the ctd feature was introduced by dubchak et al.  <cit>  for predicting protein folding classes. thereafter, the ctd feature has been adopted by many researchers for protein function and structure studies  <cit> . in ctd feature, composition  is the number of amino acids of a particular type divided by the total number of amino acids. transition  characterizes the frequency percentage with which amino acids of a particular type is followed by other amino acids. distribution  measures the chain length within which the first 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the amino acids of a particular type is located respectively. based on the ctd feature, each protein sequence of length l was encoded to a l+{l*/2} + -dimension numeric vector.

auto correlation function 
sequence autocorrelation-based features assume that the disturbances in each area are systematically related to those in adjacent areas  <cit> . this concept helps to analyze the dependency among the features of sequences in each location. autocorrelation features were computed based on the distribution of amino acid properties along the sequence, using all the  <dig> amino acid indices available in aaindex database  <cit> . in this feature encoding, for an autocorrelation of order n, each sequence was transformed into a numeric vector of length 531*n.

supervised learning technique
for classification purpose we used the support vector machine , which is a nonparametric algorithm developed by vapnik  <cit> . it is a very promising and popular method for pattern recognition that has been widely used for prediction purpose in the field of bioinformatics . it is proven to be very efficient in many biological analyses due to their ability to handle noise and large input dataset  <cit> . a brief description about the working principle of svm is described as follows:

consider a binary classification problem with n samples or input vectors x
i ∈ r
d, , where x
i with class levels y
i ∈ {− <dig>  1} can be considered as the i
th protein or vector defined in d-dimensional space . in present work,  <dig> refers to resistant class and − <dig> represents non-resistant class. the objective here is to construct a binary classifier from the available sample  that has less probability of misclassifying future sample . non-linear svm maps input vectors x
i ' s into high dimensional feature space and constructs an optimal separating hyper-plane  that maximizes the distance between hyper-plane and nearest data points of each class in the space. mathematically, the hyper-plane is represented as y = sgn, where w represents a weight vector that can map training data in the input space to the outer space and b represents bias. for a two class problem, it can be formulated as wtxi+b≥1ifyi=1wtxi+b≤−1ifyi=− <dig>  


the svm training procedure involves optimization of convex quadratic problem i.e., with lagrangian multipliers α
i ≥  <dig>  maximize∑i=1nαi−12∑i=1n∑j=1nαiαjyiyjkxixj subject to the constraints 0 ≤ α
i ≤ c  and ∑i=1nαiyi= <dig>  where c is the regularization parameter that controls trade-off between margin and classification error. the x
j ' s are called support vectors only if corresponding α
j >  <dig>  after the svm has been trained, the decision function for classification of query sequence  can be formulated as


fx=sgn∑i=1nyiαikx.xi+b.

the choice of the proper kernel function k is important to train svm model because the power of svm comes from the kernel representation that allows the nonlinear mapping of input space to a higher dimensional feature space. in this work, four commonly used kernel functions  <cit>  viz., linear , polynomial d), radial basis  and sigmoid ) were used, where r, d, γ > <dig> are the kernel parameters.

validation of the model
cross-validation procedure has been widely accepted for assessing the performance of classifiers  <cit> . thus, we used the 10-fold cross-validation to assess the performance of our approach. it was carried out by partitioning the dataset into  <dig> approximately equal-sized sets at random, where nine partitions were used to train the model and the remaining one part was used to assess the model accuracy. this process was repeated  <dig> times in such a way that each partition was tested once in the model.

performance evaluation
different performance metrics viz., sensitivity , specificity , accuracy , precision  and matthew’s correlation coefficient  were used to measure the accuracy of the developed prediction approach. the sn, sp, ac, pre and mcc parameters are defined as:sn = tp/, sp = tn/, ac = /, pre = tp/, mcc=tp×tn−fp×fn/tp+fn×tp+fp×tn+fn×tn+fp. true positive  is the number of resistant proteins correctly predicted as resistant proteins, true negative  is the number of non-resistant proteins correctly predicted as non-resistant proteins, false negative  is the number of resistant proteins incorrectly predicted as non-resistant proteins and false positive  is the number of non- resistant proteins incorrectly predicted as resistant proteins. besides the above mentioned performance metrics, area under receiving operating characteristic curve   <cit>  was also used to measure the predictive ability. for given false positive rate  and true positive rate  at different threshold values, the auc-roc was computed as ∑i1−βi.Δα+1/2Δ1−β.Δα, where Δ =  − , Δα = α
i − α
i −  <dig> and i =  <dig> , …, m   <cit> . a subroutine in r programming language was written to compute the values of these performance metrics.

training and testing datasets
using four positive sets and one negative set , four datasets were prepared that consists of both positive and negative sequences. here each dataset contains a different positive set and the same negative set . all the four datasets are highly unbalanced as the number sequences present in one class  is much larger than the other class . to avoid biasness towards the non-resistant class  while predicting using machine learning classifier like svm, balanced datasets were prepared that consists of same number of sequences from both the classes, where the sequences of the major class were randomly drawn from the available sequences of the major class. for instance, first balanced dataset contains  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative sequences, where the  <dig> negative sequences were randomly drawn from  <dig> negative sequences. as the generalized predictive ability cannot be assured based on a single dataset,  <dig> sample sets were prepared, where each sample set consists of same number of positive and negative instances. further, in each sample set, a 10-fold cross validation procedure was adopted. the performance metrics were computed by taking average over the  <dig> folds as well as over  <dig> sample sets.

mechanism-based classification
the insecticide resistance mechanism can be broadly categorized into two types, viz., target-based mechanism and detoxification-based mechanism. the rdl, kdr and ache genes come under target-based and cytochrome p <dig> genes come under detoxification-based mechanism. to test whether the genes under these two categories are different or not, a binary classification was carried out by employing svm, where  <dig> sequences  from target-based and  <dig> sequences  from detoxification-based category were used. similar to the classification of resistant and non-resistant proteins,  <dig> sample sets were prepared where each sample set consists of  <dig> sequences from each class. since, there are  <dig> sequences in the detoxification-based category,  <dig> sequences were randomly drawn each time. as the number of sequences in each sample is not large, leave-one-out cross validation  technique was adopted for classification of detoxification- and target-based resistant proteins. here, detoxification-based category was considered as positive class and target-based category as negative class.

comparison with blast algorithm
performance of the proposed approach was also compared with that of blastp  <cit> , psi-blast  <cit>  and delta-blast  <cit> , which are powerful algorithms to detect protein homologs. further, comparison was made through 10-fold cross validation technique. for cross validation, offline  blast software was used with blastp, psiblast and deltablast modules/programs in which the training set for each fold of cross validation was defined as the database and sequences of the corresponding test set were used as query. each query sequence was predicted as the resistant or non-resistant category based on the top hit found in the blast search. three different e-values i.e.,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> were used to assess the performance of the blastp, psi-blast and delta-blast. furthermore, performance of the proposed approach was compared based on best feature set with which higher accuracies were obtained as compared to the other feature sets.

performance evaluation using independent dataset
to assess the generalized predictive ability of the proposed approach, its performance was further tested using an independent test dataset. the independent dataset was collected based on published literature that includes  <dig> cytochrome p <dig>   <dig> kdr,  <dig> rdl and  <dig> ache proteins. specifically,  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> genes were reported by hsu et al.  <cit> . out of  <dig>  we used  <dig> as they are available in ncbi. similarly,  <dig> kdr,  <dig> rdl and  <dig> ache genes were collected from ncbi, based on the study of zuo et al.  <cit> , wondji et al.  <cit>  and li and han  <cit>  respectively. sequences of the independent test set are provided in additional file  <dig> 

development of prediction server
an online prediction server was developed using html and php, where the combination of best feature set and classifier was used. a developed r-code was executed in background upon submission of the sequences in fasta format to the server. the user has to submit the protein sequences having only standard amino acid residues. this server can be used to predict the likelihood of any unknown protein sequence being an insecticide resistant protein with certain probability.

RESULTS

the composition of amino acids in four different groups of insecticide resistant proteins is shown in fig.  <dig>  it is seen that the proportions of leucine  are higher, whereas the proportions of cystene  and tryptophan  are lower in all the four categories.fig.  <dig> composition of amino acids in all the four categories of insecticide resistant proteins. it is observed that proportions of leucine are higher, whereas proportions of cystene and tryptophan are lower in all the four categories




analysis of kernel functions
based on a sample dataset consisting of  <dig> positive and  <dig> negative sequences that were drawn randomly from the available positive and negative sequences, performance of svm was analyzed. roc curves for all the four kernels as well as for all the five feature sets are shown in fig. 2a and the corresponding auc-roc values are shown in bar plots . from the roc curves it is not clear that which kernel is better, whereas from auc-roc plots it is clear that the values of auc-roc are higher for the rbf kernel, irrespective of the feature set used. though in rbf kernel the auc-roc for acf feature set is highest, it is difficult to choose the best feature set while other three kernels are taken into account. therefore, all the feature sets and the rbf kernel were used for further analysis.fig.  <dig>

cross-validation performance analysis
for all the four datasets  as well as for all the feature sets, performance metrics averaged over 10-fold as well as  <dig> sample sets are given in table  <dig>  moreover, to analyze the trend in accuracies, performance metrics are also plotted in line graphs . it is observed that the sensitivities are less as compared to the specificities . further, higher accuracies are observed for the dataset having resistant proteins with <90% pair-wise sequence identity, whereas lower accuracies are observed for the dataset having resistant proteins with <40% pair-wise sequence identity . though the specificities are observed almost unchanged, sensitivities are observed to be increased with increase in the percentage of pair-wise sequence identity in the positive dataset . besides, it is seen that the most of the performance metrics for dpc and ctd feature sets are higher as compared to the other feature sets . in particular, overall accuracy , mcc  and auc-roc  are observed to be highest for dpc feature set. since the number of sequences in the positive dataset having sequences with <90% pair-wise sequence identity is larger as compared to the dataset having sequences with <40% pair-wise sequence identity, the former one is used in subsequent analyses.table  <dig> estimates of different performance metrics for svm with rbf kernel in discriminating resistant from non-resistant proteins, under all the feature sets as well as different percentage of sequence identity in the positive dataset

comparative analysis
for comparing the proposed approach with blast algorithms, we prepared two different datasets. the first dataset contains  <dig> resistant proteins  and randomly drawn  <dig> non-resistant proteins , and the second dataset contains  <dig> resistant proteins  and randomly drawn  <dig> non-resistant proteins . furthermore, performance of the proposed approach was compared based on dpc feature set only as higher accuracies were obtained for this feature set as compared to the other feature sets. in both the datasets, no hits were found for most of the query sequences with e-values  <dig>  and  <dig>  however, hits were found for all the query sequences with e-value  <dig>  therefore, comparison was made based on e-value  <dig> only, and the accuracies averaged over 10-folds are given in table  <dig>  it is observed that the overall accuracies of the proposed approach are ~10% higher than that of blastp, psi-blast and delta-blast, in both datasets . though, true positive rates  of the blast algorithms are higher, false positive rates  are much lower at the same time. among the blast algorithms, delta-blast performed better than both blastp and psi-blast, with both the datasets . barring sensitivity, the proposed approach performed better than blast algorithms in terms of all the performance metrics. it is further seen that the specificities are higher for the first dataset as compared to the second dataset.table  <dig> performance metrics for the proposed approach, blast, psi-blast and delta-blast, in discriminating the resistant proteins from non-resistant proteins, where the positive dataset consists of <40%  and <90%  pair-wise sequence identity

discussion
extensive use of chemical insecticides has been selecting resistant population of insect species to different insecticides, worldwide  <cit> . around  <dig> insect species have been reported to resist different insecticides till the end of  <dig>  <cit> . insecticidal resistance has been associated with the genetic changes in insects. for instance, a mutation in an insect can alter the behavior, metabolism and physiology by which insect may gain advantage in resisting to different insecticides  <cit> . most of the earlier studies are dealt with the mutational changes associated with the insecticide resistance. though insecticide resistance is an important researchable issue, there is no computational tool available for prediction of insecticide resistant proteins. therefore, we made an attempt to present the first computational approach for prediction of insecticide resistant proteins.

we considered four different categories of insecticide resistant proteins corresponding to four different classes of insecticide resistance genes viz., cytochrome p <dig>  ache, rdl and kdr. the leucine content was predominantly found in all the four categories of proteins, which has been reported to play an important role in insecticide resistance. for instance, prince et al.  <cit>  reported that leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase “brassinosteroid insensitive1-associated kinase1” contributes to the innate immunity to aphids in arabidopsis. the valine to leucine  and the leucine to isoleucine mutations  were identified in three pesticide-resistant strains of bed bug   <cit> . further, the composition of tryptophan which has been reported to present in the active site that interacts with trimethyl-ammonium cationic group of ache was found lowest  <cit> . hassani et al.  <cit>  described that lysine and tryptophan  are the most reactive residues that play important role in disrupting the function of neuronal sodium channels by ts gamma, which is the most potent neurotoxin in the venom of the brazilian scorpion tityus serrulatus.


for classification of insecticide resistant and non-resistant proteins, initially the sequences were transformed into numeric feature vectors based on different feature generation techniques viz., aac, dpc, paac, acf and ctd. the encoded numeric vectors were then used as input in binary svm classifier. prediction accuracies were found to be higher for rbf kernel as compared to the other three kernels of svm. further, the classification accuracies were found higher for dpc feature set as compared to the other feature sets, which may be due to the fact that in dpc the local ordering of amino acids were taken into account  <cit> . furthermore, in cross validation analysis , the sensitivity was found to be increased with increase in the percentage of pair-wise sequence identity in the positive dataset. this may be due to the fact that with increase in the pair-wise sequence identity in the positive dataset, it is less-likely that a positive sequence will be misclassified in the negative dataset. the accuracy in discriminating the target-based and detoxification-based resistance proteins from non-resistant proteins was also found to be higher. besides, higher discrimination accuracy was also observed between target-based and detoxification-based resistance proteins. thus, it can be inferred that the composition of di-peptides are not only different between resistant and non-resistant proteins but also among insecticide resistant proteins involved in different insecticide resistance mechanisms.

the performance of the proposed approach was compared with blast, psi-blast and delta-blast algorithms. though, prediction was made for three e-values i.e.,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  no hits were found for most of the query sequences  for the first two e-values. thus performance metrics were computed based on e-value  <dig> only, which is also the default e-value in blast algorithms. though the resistant proteins were predicted with higher accuracy, the specificities were found much lower. it was also found that the specificities are higher for the first dataset as compared to the second dataset. one of the possible reasons for this may be that when the pair-wise sequence identity is <40% in the positive class , sequence similarity between the classes will be less. on the other hand, when the pair-wise sequence identity is <90% in the positive class, sequence similarity between the positive and negative classes will be more by which the likelihood of a sequence of the negative class to be predicted in the positive class will be more and vice versa. in terms of overall accuracy, the proposed approach outperformed all the three variations of blast algorithm. among the blast algorithms, delta-blast performed better followed by psi-blast and blast. the performance of the proposed approach was also assessed using an independent test dataset consisting of  <dig> resistant protein sequences . out these  <dig> sequences, all were correctly predicted when the pair-wise sequence identity was <90% in the positive dataset of training set, whereas  <dig> were correctly predicted in for the training dataset having positive sequences with <40% pair-wise sequence identity. nevertheless, the proposed approach achieved higher accuracy for predicting the insecticide resistant proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper presents the first computational approach for predicting the insecticide resistant proteins. based on this approach, a web server has also been developed that can be easily used by the scientists and researchers to computationally identify the insecticide resistant proteins. the proposed computational approach is believed to supplement the wet-lab experiments for identifying and targeting the insecticide resistant proteins to develop dynamic and efficient insecticides.
