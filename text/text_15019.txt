BACKGROUND
genomic islands are sections of bacterial genomes that have been acquired by horizontal transfer and are characterized by one or more of the following criteria:  are absent from the identical location in closely related strains or species;  contain an altered g/c content as compared to the rest of the genome;  inserted adjacent to a trna gene "anchoring" site,  associated with mobile dna sequences such as phage, transposon, or plasmid genes or remnants;  can be genetically unstable; and  contain blocks of genes that work together for a specific function such as molecular transport, specialized metabolism or host cell interactions  <cit> . the functions of many genomic island gene clusters related to specific phenotypes have been studied in great detail for a number of bacteria  <cit> . however, the study of the evolution of genomic islands has been mostly performed at the sequence level using computer software to compare bacterial genomic sequences or by genomic dna microarray hybridization analysis  <cit> .

an alternative way to study the evolution of genomic islands would be to clone the island of interest, transfer it to other bacterial hosts, and analyze the expression and function of the genes once the island is established in the new hosts. when studied in this way, we gain information on how a given genomic island has evolved up to the current point in time. this kind of approach would allow the researcher to ask several key questions concerning the evolution of a genomic island that are difficult or not possible to answer with sequence analysis:  have the island genes evolved to be expressed in only the host in which they are found or are they able to be expressed in other bacterial hosts?  if the island genes are able to be expressed in other hosts, is this a narrow range of related hosts or a broad range of hosts?  does the island consist of a combination of genes showing different host requirements for expression?  are there regulators that direct expression of island genes in certain hosts that are absent from other hosts? the answers to these questions would give important insight into the evolutionary distribution of regulatory mechanisms that genomic islands "plug-into" upon horizontal transfer to a given bacterial host background. in certain cases, the presence or absence of an expressed and functional genomic island is a determining factor in assigning a particular bacterium to its species, strain type, or evolutionary lineage  <cit> . in addition, knowledge gained from answers to the questions above would allow researchers to better manipulate the useful functions contained on genomic islands for beneficial bacterial genetic engineering purposes.

very few studies have utilized the "clone-and-transfer" approach described above to study genomic island evolution, and these studies have used a narrow range of closely-related strains or species as island hosts  <cit> . in this study, we transfer a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium genomic island  that has been cloned onto a broad-host range vector to a wide range of gram negative gamma- and alpha-proteobacterial hosts. we then test for the expression of  <dig> of the island genes  in the different hosts using a combination of reverse transcriptase-pcr  and reporter gene promoter fusions. our results indicate that:  island stm <dig> contains genes that are able to be expressed in all hosts tested and genes that are not detectably expressed in certain hosts; and  the hosts that are unable to detectably express island stm <dig> genes belong to more distantly-related alpha-proteobacterial genera. this information provides experimental evidence for the existence of at least two classes of genomic island genes:  those that are expressed by mechanisms that have evolved to be utilized in a broad range of hosts; and  those that have evolved to be expressed by other mechanisms that are host-specific. the regulatory systems that control the latter category of genes may represent key mechanisms that serve to shape bacterial evolution by affecting the expression characteristics of horizontally-transferred dna. genomic island promoter regions that display host-specific activity, such as the ones identified in this study, can be used as tools to identify the regulators that drive their expression and potentially the expression of genes in other chromosomal regions if the regulatory system is global in nature. to our knowledge, this is the first experimental approach to systematically analyze genomic island gene expression in a broad range of gamma- and alpha-proteobacterial hosts. our present analysis of island stm <dig> also allowed us to determine the sequence of the target site of the is <dig> element found in this island in s. typhimurium strain lt <dig>  and we propose that this element was inserted after the island had already been acquired by the s. typhimurium lineage.

RESULTS
s. typhimurium genomic island 4305
the genomic island inserted at the pheu trna gene in s. typhimurium has been previously identified and is named for the first stm orf that is present in the island   <cit> . though the pheu trna is a common site for insertion of genomic islands in different gram negative bacteria, the genes of the  <dig> kb island  <dig> appear to be unique to s. typhimurium  <cit> . the genes of island  <dig> and adjacent chromosomal genes are listed in table  <dig>  we previously cloned a  <dig> kb s. typhimurium genomic region that included the entire island  <dig> onto the self-transmissible, broad-host-range plasmid r <dig> using the vex-capture technique for targeted cloning of large chromosomal sections  <cit> . a map of the island and the adjacent genes that are present in the r <dig> + island  <dig> clone is presented in figure  <dig>  note that the likely transcriptional units/operons and promoter regions can be predicted from the spacing and orientation of the genes in this region.

the is <dig> element present in island stm <dig> in strain lt <dig> is absent from the corresponding location in strains χ <dig> and uk-1: a rare glimpse at an is <dig> target site before insertion
the sequence of island  <dig> was obtained from the s. typhimurium strain lt <dig> and indicates the presence of an is <dig> element inserted cleanly between the stm <dig> and stm <dig> genes  <cit> . the stm <dig> gene encodes the transposase for the is <dig> element. we cloned island  <dig> from a different strain of s. typhimurium, χ <dig>  which is a mouse-passaged isolate of strain sl <dig>  <cit> . pcr analysis of the structure of island  <dig> from both lt <dig> and χ <dig> indicated that there was dna absent from the is <dig> region in strain χ <dig> . primers hybridizing to a region just 3' of stm <dig> and to the 3' end of the stm <dig> orf gave an approximately  <dig> bp product for the lt <dig> genome as predicted, but a smaller  <dig> bp product for the χ <dig> genome. the smaller pcr product was also observed using these primers with the s. typhimurium uk- <dig> genome . we sequenced the pcr products obtained from χ <dig> and uk- <dig>  and analysis of these sequences revealed that the is <dig> element was absent from these strains and that the target site of the is <dig> element could be identified. this is significant because the is <dig> element is extremely stable and jumps very rarely, and the number of sequenced is <dig> target sites before insertion is very rare  <cit> . our sequence analysis revealed that the target site consisted of three "t" residues in the middle of an a/t rich region, and that this target sequence was duplicated upon insertion . this is very similar to the small number of is <dig> target sites that have been previously characterized, though it has been proposed that is <dig> duplicates only  <dig> –  <dig> bp upon insertion  <cit> . the ends of the is <dig> element shown in figure  <dig> that are present in strain lt <dig> are an exact match to other sequenced is <dig> ends  <cit> . since island  <dig> was clearly acquired by the s. typhimurium lineage before the different strain variations occurred and since the is <dig> element is highly stable once it has inserted, we propose that the is <dig> element in island  <dig> inserted after the island had already been acquired by s. typhimurium. the alternative proposal of loss of the is <dig> element after island  <dig> acquisition is in our view highly unlikely. this implies that is <dig> transposase activity is not involved with integration or excision of island  <dig> 

role of island stm <dig> in host cell interactions
the use of the vex-capture system to clone island  <dig> also allowed convenient lox/cre-mediated construction of an s. typhimurium mutant that is deleted for the island  <dig> genes  <cit> . since a number of s. typhimurium genomic islands play a role in the ability of the bacteria to interact with eukaryotic host cells and since the stm <dig> gene  has been previously demonstrated to affect s. typhimurium invasion gene expression  <cit> , we compared the Δ island  <dig> mutant to the isogenic wt parental strain in the ability to adhere and invade the colonic epithelial cell line ht- <dig>  our results indicate that deletion of island  <dig> has no effect on the ability of s. typhimurium to adhere to or invade host cells . we also measured the adherence and invasion of noninvasive e. coli and p. putida cells containing either r <dig> or r <dig> + island  <dig> and found that the presence of island  <dig> had no effect on the interaction of these bacteria with host cells . we also performed the same assay using j <dig> murine macrophage-like cells and found that the deletion of island  <dig> from s. typhimurium and its presence in e. coli and p. putida did not affect the survival of these strains compared to controls over the course of a  <dig> hour intracellular survival assay . taken together, these results indicate that island  <dig> does not contain any virulence factors that promote interactions with eukaryotic host cells under the conditions tested here.

analysis of the chromosomal and cloned island  <dig> transcriptional profiles in s. typhimurium using rt-pcr
to analyze the gene expression profile of island  <dig> in s. typhimurium, we used rt-pcr assays to detect gene transcription. total cellular rna was isolated from late-log phase wt strain χ <dig> cultures, single-strand cdna was synthesized, and the cdna was used as template for pcr amplification using primers specific to the island  <dig> genes that are indicated in figure  <dig> and that belong to different transcriptional units in the island. we also included two genes just adjacent to island  <dig> in our analysis, stm <dig> and stm <dig>  the rt-pcr analysis indicated that all the tested genes contained in island  <dig> and the adjacent genes are detectably expressed in s. typhimurium under the conditions used here . we then tested the expression profile of the tested genes in the strain χ <dig> Δ island  <dig> containing the r <dig> + island  <dig> plasmid. the strain χ <dig> Δ island  <dig> containing r <dig> was used as a control. we found that the tested genes were detectably expressed from the cloned island in s. typhimurium while no rt-pcr products were observed for the tested island genes in the r995-containing strain . however, two genes that are part of the r <dig> vector, trfa and korb, were detectably expressed in both the r <dig> and r <dig> + island  <dig> strains. primers hybridizing to an intergenic region between genes stm <dig> and stm <dig> that is predicted to be non-transcribed were also used as a negative control. these primers gave no rt-pcr product in all strains tested, but did give a product when an island-containing dna template was used . the result with gene stm <dig> in this analysis is worth particular note. as compared to the other tested genes, stm <dig> gave a weakly detectable band, and this result was observed for both the chromosomal and cloned island r <dig> regions . overall, the rt-pcr analysis indicates that the transcriptional profiles of the chromosomal and cloned island  <dig> regions are extremely similar.

transfer of island stm <dig> to a range of gram negative bacteria and analysis of island gene expression by rt-pcr
the vector used for the cloned island  <dig> region, r <dig>  is a broad-host-range, self-transmissible plasmid. this allowed us to study the s. typhimurium-specific island  <dig> in a wide range of other gram negative hosts to gain information on genomic island evolution. we transferred r <dig> + island  <dig> to ten other gram negative hosts belonging to eight different genera as described in the materials and methods. five of the hosts  belong to the gamma-proteobacterial group , and five of the hosts  belong to the alpha-proteobacterial group. the same strains containing r <dig> were used for control comparisons. after we obtained the desired transconjugants and confirmed the establishment of r <dig> + island  <dig> in the different hosts, we used the rt-pcr analysis as described above to determine if the tested genes are expressed in the alternative hosts. a representative example of our results is shown in figure  <dig> and a full list of the results in each host is shown in table  <dig>  some of the tested genes were expressed in all hosts tested . however, some genes were not detectably expressed in certain hosts while being expressed in others . the trfa gene contained on the r <dig> vector was strongly expressed in all hosts. comparing the quantitated rt-pcr signals of the tested genes to that of trfa in each host allowed us to put the genes into three different expression groups. using a ratio of each gene signal to that of the trfa signal, the following groups could be assigned:  genes that were readily detectable had ratios from  <dig>  –  <dig> ;  genes that were barely detectable had ratios of  <dig>  –  <dig> ; and  genes that were not detectable had ratios of less than  <dig> . these results, which can be arranged as a matrix to give an expression "array" of the island genes in the different bacterial backgrounds, are summarized in table  <dig>  a number of observations can be made by scanning this table:  some of the tested genes are expressed in all hosts tested;  some of the genes are not detectably expressed in some of the hosts; and  the hosts that are not able to express certain genes are not randomly distributed, but are restricted to the more distantly-related genera of the alpha-proteobacterial group. these genera, novosphingobium, agrobacterium, rhizobium, and rhodobacter, contain bacteria that are found exclusively in environmental soil and water habitats, as opposed to the other genera that contain bacteria that can be found to interact with mammalian cells.

subcloning of the stm <dig> and stm <dig> promoter regions into a lacz reporter vector
to confirm our rt-pcr results and to show the utility of subcloning genomic island promoters to express genes in a host-specific manner, we transcriptionally fused the stm <dig> and stm <dig> promoter regions  to a lacz reporter on an incq-based, broad-host-range plasmid. we then transferred these constructs to other gram negative hosts and assayed lacz expression in each host compared to a vector only control. in the wt and Δ island  <dig> s. typhimurium hosts, pr  <dig> expressed lacz at a very high level indicating that the subcloned promoter region is active and does not require other island  <dig> genes to function . we also constructed a lacz fusion in which the stm <dig> promoter region was deleted from the subcloned fragment  and this fusion displayed significantly decreased lacz activity in both s. typhimurium hosts . in the gram negative hosts e. coli, p. putida, p. aeruginosa, a. tumefaciens, and r. meliloti, pr  <dig> induced lacz expression to levels ranging from  <dig> –  <dig> fold over the vector control . this result supports the rt-pcr findings since stm <dig> was found to be detectably expressed in all hosts tested via this assay. the Δpr  <dig> construct displayed significant or complete loss of lacz activity compared to the pr  <dig> constructs in all hosts tested .

the activity of the pr  <dig> lacz fusion in the wt and Δ island  <dig> s. typhimurium hosts was also found to be very high compared to the vector control . however, this construct displayed host specific activity in other gram negative hosts that was consistent with the rt-pcr results . in e. coli and p. aeruginosa, pr <dig> induced significant levels of lacz activity, but in r. meliloti, the activity of the pr  <dig> construct was very similar to that of the vector control. these findings demonstrate that the subcloned promoter regions can be used to drive host-specific gene expression in a manner that is predicted by the rt-pcr results.

identification of a conserved dna site that is associated with differentially-expressed island  <dig> genes
to determine if dna sequence similarities exist between any of the island  <dig> promoter regions, these dna sequences  were aligned and analyzed for common motifs. strikingly, a conserved dna site was identified and found to be located upstream of both stm <dig> and  <dig> . a divergent version of this site was also found upstream of stm <dig>  the stm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were found to be differentially-expressed. no common dna site was found to be associated with the genes expressed in all hosts using the methods here. the dna site is  <dig> bp in length and differs at only two positions between the stm <dig> and  <dig> locations. part of the site displays a palindromic nature as indicated in figure  <dig>  it is noteworthy to mention that each site is located entirely within the corresponding bracketed regions noted in figure  <dig> that contain no open reading frames and are predicted to contain transcriptional signals. a search for this dna site in genome databases revealed several matches in other gamma-proteobacterial species, including salmonella enterica serovars, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, klebsiella pneumonia, and pasteurella multocida . we note that these were the only species that gave a significant match to the full 19-bp site and that the sites reside in genomic locations that have not been characterized.

discussion
in this report, we present an experimental approach to study the evolution of species-specific bacterial genomic islands that extends the current methods of study. the "clone and transfer" approach presented here involves cloning the genomic island of interest and transferring it to a number of other hosts that represent a range of evolutionary distances from the original host. the researcher can then test island gene expression and function in the alternative hosts. of particular interest are genes that are either:  expressed in the original host but not in alternative hosts, or  not expressed in the original host but able to be expressed in alternative hosts. we observed genes belonging to the former class on island  <dig> in this study . this implies that a mechanism that directs transcription of certain island  <dig> genes under the conditions tested here is absent from the hosts in which we are unable to detect expression of these genes. such regulatory mechanisms are intriguing because their presence or absence in a given host may determine if a particular horizontally-transferred dna fragment is able to be expressed and to function in that host. indeed, such regulatory mechanisms could be "molecular keys" that are important factors in shaping bacterial evolution. however, the regulatory mechanisms that control those genes that are expressed in all hosts tested may be significant also. these genes could represent cassettes that are expressed by conserved, highly active sigma  <dig>  promoters or by autoregulatory mechanisms that function in all hosts. these types of mechanisms could yield important information about broad-host-range gene expression systems that allow particular genes to be propagated in a promiscuous manner. alternatively, the "non-host-specific" genes could be controlled by genetically unlinked regulatory mechanisms that are highly conserved across different bacterial genera.

it is possible that the genes found not to be expressed in certain hosts may be expressed in those hosts under conditions other than those tested here. when testing different growth conditions for use in this study, we found that growth in lb media  to late log phase was the best condition to allow growth of all the host strains tested so that comparisons across a wide range of bacteria could be made. if there are conditions that allow expression of genes in those hosts where we did not detect expression, clearly the mechanism involved in allowing that expression differs considerably in its regulation and/or activity as compared to in the other hosts where expression was detected under the conditions used here. in addition, an entirely different mechanism could be functioning in those hosts to allow the gene expression under those conditions. in either case, the results would indicate bacterial background-specific differences in the presence or functioning of the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene being analyzed.

further studies may allow identification of the factors that regulate expression of the host-specific and non-host-specific genes using their promoter regions as an important molecular tool. the identification of such factors could have very important implications. first, certain regulatory mechanisms that control genomic island gene expression are often used by multiple islands  in the same host. therefore, identification of a regulatory mechanism for the genes of one genomic island could represent a global mechanism that is used by that host for multiple different island genes or other genes. there are multiple examples of such regulatory mechanisms, and in many cases, the identification of these mechanisms occurred by identifying differentially regulated genomic island genes  <cit> . second, these mechanisms could be essential when using genomic islands to engineer alternative bacterial hosts for beneficial medical, environmental, and/or industrial purposes. for example, if a particular host of interest does not express key genes on an island that has been introduced for engineering purposes, then introduction of the necessary regulatory mechanism into this host would then allow the desired gene expression.

when analyzing island  <dig> gene expression in the other gram negative hosts, three possible predicted results could be that tested genes are:  expressed in all other alternative hosts;  differentially expressed in other hosts in a random fashion not dependent on evolutionary relationship; and  differentially expressed in other hosts in a manner that displays a pattern based on evolutionary relationship. our results support the last prediction. this pattern is one such that some island  <dig> genes are not expressed in certain hosts, and these hosts belong to more evolutionarily-distant genera of the alpha-proteobacterial group. s. typhimurium belongs to the enterobacteriacae in the gamma-proteobacterial group which is characterized by genera that are capable of interacting with mammalian hosts. by contrast, the hosts that were unable to detectably express certain island  <dig> genes belong to genera that are characterized by their environmental water and soil habitats and ability to metabolically utilize a wide range of different compounds found in the environment. a phylogenetic tree based on the 16s ribosomal rna sequences of the bacterial species used in this study confirms that the gamma and alpha classification scheme correlates to basic evolutionary differences in addition to the previously noted phenotypic differences . the tree shows that s. typhimurium is indeed more evolutionary related to the other gamma-protobacteria than to the alpha-proteobacteria, as the two classification groups can be clearly divided in the tree. one interesting branch to note is that for rhodobacter sphaeroides; this species has a common ancestor more closely related to the gamma group than the alpha group . however, this species shows differential expression of island  <dig> genes as do other members of the alpha group. the basic differences between the gamma and alpha groups could indicate large differences in the gene regulatory systems that are present in the respective genomes. the identification of these different gene regulatory systems  may offer clues to the basic genetic regulatory mechanisms that can distinguish different genera over the course of evolution.

another interesting result from our gene expression analysis is that of the five tested genes that were unable to be detectably expressed in certain hosts, four displayed this result in multiple hosts . this contributes to the "boxed" pattern of such genes in table  <dig>  the alternative result of a more random "checkerboard" pattern of such genes in this table was not observed. in our view, this supports the hypothesis that a regulatory mechanism that is conserved in more closely-related hosts is absent from the more distantly-related hosts. interestingly, stm <dig>  also known as rtsa, is a gene that has been shown  to affect expression of genes that mediate interactions of s. typhimurium with host cells  <cit> . stm <dig>  known as phon, is a non-specific phosphatase that is found in other members of the enterobacteriacae  <cit> . the genes stm <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> all encode putative, uncharacterized proteins. a conserved 19-bp dna site was found to be present in the promoter regions of stm <dig> and  <dig>  and a related site was found in the stm <dig> promoter region. the site was also found exclusively in the genomes of several other gamma-proteobacterial species. it is not known at this time whether this site plays a role in the differential expression patterns of these island  <dig> genes, and further research will be necessary to determine if this dna sequence plays a role in gene regulation. however, the identification of dna sites such as this one may provide clues that aid in the characterization of genomic island gene regulation.

the promoters identified in a study such as this one have the potential to be used for experimental applications where the researcher wants a gene turned off  in one host and turned on upon transfer of this gene to another host  without the need for the addition of artificial inducers. such promoters could have significant utility in the study of multi-genera bacterial bio-communities and other broad-host-range bacterial studies. the approach described here allows targeted, systematic identification of such promoters that may be contained on genomic islands or any other region of a bacterial genome.

CONCLUSIONS
the evolution of genomic island genes can be studied by transferring the genomic island to a range of bacterial hosts of different evolutionary distances from the original host and systematically analyzing the expression of the genes compared to proper controls. using an island cloned from the s. typhimurium genome, we show that  some island genes are able to be expressed in all hosts tested while some are unable to be detectably expressed in certain hosts; and  the hosts that are unable to express island  <dig> genes belong to more distantly-related genera of the alpha-proteobacterial group. this provides an approach to answer the basic question of whether genes on the island have evolved to be expressed only in the host of origin or are able to be expressed in other bacterial backgrounds. the information gained from such studies can be used to help facilitate the identification of the mechanisms responsible for any bacteria-specific expression patterns. these potentially important mechanisms may be responsible for determining the expression characteristics of horizontally-tranferred dna and may serve to globally regulate a number of genes within a given bacterial background.
