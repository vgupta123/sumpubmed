BACKGROUND
in flowering plants, male reproductive organs are called stamens, each of which consists of a filament and an anther  <cit> . cells in the anther undergo meiosis to produce microspores, which further develop into mature pollen grains  <cit> . therefore, anther development is critical to achieve pollen formation and subsequent success of fertilization  <cit> . according to morphological features, anther development can be grouped into two phases and then be further divided into  <dig> anther stages  <cit> . at the beginning of phase  <dig> , the stamen primordium has  <dig> layers, l1-l <dig> from surface to interior. the l <dig> cells later become the epidermis and the l <dig> cells give rise to the vascular and connective tissues. some of the l <dig> cells develop into archesporial cells which then divide into parietal cells and primary sporogenous cells. additional cell division and differentiation in the l2-lineage establish a characteristic four-lobed structure at anther stage  <dig>  each lobe consists of central pollen mother cells surrounded by outer endothecium, middle layer and inner tapetum. pollen mother cells undergo meiosis at stage 5- <dig>  producing tetrads at stage  <dig>  dissolution of the tetrad callose wall releases microspores at stage  <dig>  in phase  <dig>  the microspores undergo mitosis and develop into mature pollen grains during stages 9- <dig>  meanwhile, pollen wall materials are deposited from both the microspores and the tapetum layer. after the degeneration of tapetum, the mature pollen is released and is able to start pollination.

previous studies indicated that early anther development depends on transcriptional regulation and cell-cell communication  <cit> . the sporocyteless /nozzle  gene is one of the earliest genes that regulate anther cell fate determination  <cit> . spl/nzz is activated by ag, a c function gene in the abc model  <cit> . spl/nzz is expressed as early as anther stage 2- <dig> and a mutation in spl/nzz leads to the failure of differentiation of parietal and sporogenous cells, and consequentially blocks the formation of anther wall and microsporocytes  <cit> .

excess male sporocytes <dig>  and tapetum determinant <dig>  are also essential for male fertility with a later expression peak at stage  <dig>  <cit> . ems <dig> is a leucine-rich repeat receptor-like protein kinase  and tpd <dig> is likely its ligand  <cit> . in both ems <dig> and tpd <dig> mutants, anthers produce more microsporocytes at the expense of the tapetum, indicating that communication between adjacent cell layers determines the cell fate of archesporial cell progenies in order to form normal anther wall  <cit> . besides ems <dig> and tpd <dig>  other cell-cell communication-related genes are also involved in anther development, such as somatic embryogenesis receptorlike kinases1/ <dig> , and receptorlike protein kinase <dig>   <cit> .

upon the formation of the anther lobes, dysfunctional tapetum <dig>  and ams, encoding two bhlh transcription factors, are required for tapetal functions at subsequent stages  <cit> . in dyt <dig>  tapetum cells harbor enlarged vacuoles and reduced cytoplasm. the dyt <dig> meiocytes have comparatively thin callose walls, cannot complete cytokinesis and finally collapse. rna in situ hybridization experiments showed that dyt <dig> reaches its peak expression at anther stage  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . ams functions near the time of meiosis, slightly later than that of dyt <dig>  in the ams mutant, the microsporocytes can complete meiosis but the tapetum cells prematurely collapse and microspores are degraded before the first pollen mitosis  <cit> . beside these regulators, a large number of other genes are also expressed in the anther, and mutations in some of them lead to male sterility by affecting early anther cell formation, tapetum formation, meiosis or pollen maturation  <cit> .

however, due to the functional redundancy of members of many gene families, the subtleties of the phenotypes of single-gene mutants, and possible early phenotypes that obscure anther function, forward genetics has limitations in uncovering anther gene functions  <cit> . expression profiling has become increasingly informative and might circumvent the limitation of forward genetics. in recent years, global gene expression profiling by microarray has been used to detect floral gene expression and obtain clues for understanding reproductive development. however, most studies to investigate stamen expression profiles have been conducted by analyzing transcripts from the whole inflorescences of male sterile mutants  <cit> , rather than the anther itself  <cit> . little transcriptomic information about specific organs is currently available, especially for arabidopsis whose male reproductive organs are quite tiny  <cit> . thus the detection of anther-specific or preferential genes in mixed floral tissues might be hampered by the moderate detection sensitivity of microarray technology. as mentioned above, spl, ems <dig> and ams have important functions at different stages of anther development, although they have temporal overlap of expression  <cit> . therefore, analysis of their shared and distinct effects on the anther transcriptome can shed some light on gene regulatory networks  <cit> .

to obtain more information on transcriptomes near the stage of meiosis, we collected anthers at stage  <dig> to  <dig> from ams mutants and wild-type arabidopsis, even though it is time consuming and technically difficult to dissect developing anthers, because we wanted to identify the genes affected by the ams mutation that might be too diluted to detect using rnas from whole-inflorescences. the ams transcriptome data and comparison with previous data from spl and ems <dig> anthers  <cit>  provide detailed information on early anther development. additionally, with known information of other floral organs in arabidopsis, we identified genes that function during early anther stage around meiosis. we found that many transcription factor genes were preferentially expressed during early anther development, such as bhlh, myb, and mads. closely related homologs were hypothesized to have either redundant or divergent functions according to phylogenic studies  <cit> . moreover, further investigation of organ-specific transcriptome revealed the importance of both anther-specific and non-specific transcription factors in early anther development. we propose an expanded gene regulatory network that contributes to the precise regulation of temporal and spatial events during early anther development.

RESULTS
identification of genes regulated by ams
to characterize genes involved in tapetum development and function near the time of meiosis, we isolated total rna of stage 4- <dig> anthers from wild-type and the ams mutant plants for affymatrix ath <dig> microarray analysis. we included three biological replicates for each genotype and the results are highly reproducible . we identified  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed in ams compared with wild-type anthers with at least 2-fold differences    <cit> . the scatter-plot of the  <dig>  genes shows that they include genes expressed at different levels ; furthermore, genes with higher expression in ams than wild-type tend to have low wild type expression, whereas those with lower than normal expression in ams tend to be expressed at higher levels .

recently, xu et al. reported totally  <dig> genes that are differentially expressed in ams floral buds compared with wild-type buds, at four different stages using two color arrays, including  <dig> genes that were differentially expressed near the time of meiosis   <cit> . among the  <dig>  genes identified in our study,  <dig> were also identified by xu et al. in floral buds . because ams is expressed from near anther stage  <dig>  through the formation of microspores, our samples from early stage anthers allowed an examination of the early ams function in regulating transcriptome and sensitive detection of expression shifts without dilution by other floral tissues, resulting in the identification of additional  <dig>  genes  with differential expression between wild-type and ams anthers .

nevertheless, our results and the previous study did both detect  <dig> genes that are significantly affected by the ams mutation   <cit> . some of these genes show the same direction in expression shifts between the two studies; however, others had the opposite directions . specifically,  <dig> genes with higher expression in the ams anther than the wild-type anther had reduced expression levels in the ams inflorescence compared with the wild-type inflorescence ;  <dig> genes showed the opposite trend. these differences might be due to the difference of sampling anther vs. flower bud that included later stages, although other possibilities cannot be ruled out. we observed more similar expression pattern between our anther transcriptome and the published flower bud transcriptome at meiosis stage .  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes down-regulated in ams were expressed significantly higher in the wild type anther than the inflorescence, while  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated genes showed this pattern , suggesting that preferential anther expression contributed to the difference between the two studies. it is also possible that the loss of ams function might affect other aspects of flower development than anther development, although not revealed by phenotypic changes.

the go categorization analysis of our anther transcriptome results showed that categories of enzymes, transporters, structural and other molecular proteins were over-represented in the genes with reduced expression, and hydrolases in those with elevated expression levels in ams compared with wild-type . to further investigate the putative functions of genes with different expression patterns in the ams anther from inflorescence, we then applied go categorization to all the newly found differentially expressed genes in the ams anther. we found that some categories were enriched in those with reduced expression levels in the ams anther, such as structural molecules, transporters, oxidoreductases . these categories are associated with metabolic activities that are very dynamic in tapetum, suggesting a positive role of ams in regulating metabolic functions in the tapetum. meanwhile, genes with ion binding, glycosyl-transferase and hydrolase activities were enriched among the genes activated in ams.

as a putative bhlh transcription factor, ams has the ability to bind to the canonical bhlh binding site  in vitro and in vivo  <cit> . in order to find candidate ams target genes, we searched e-box elements within  <dig> kb upstream sequences of genes with statistically significant differential expression between ams and wild-type anthers . we did not find statistically significant interaction between the number of e-boxes in the putative promoter regions and the fold change in gene expression . it is possible that active ams binding sites are located not just in the 1-kb regions being analyzed, but also in regions further upstream or even downstream of the coding region. it is also possible that a number of the genes affected in the ams anthers are indirectly regulated by ams, hence not containing ams-binding sites in their promoters.

ams affects genes with putative functions in phosphorylation, exocytosis, stress-response and ubiquitin-proteasome pathways during male reproduction
both somatic and reproductive cells were evidently affected in the ams mutant anther, morphologically and transcriptomically  <cit> . specifically, the ams inflorescence showed reduced expression of genes predicted to be involved in metabolism, such as lipid synthesis-related genes  <cit> . our anther transcriptome data provided spatially more specific information for the expression patterns of metabolism-related genes  and showed that the expression levels of genes involved in cell wall formation, lipid synthesis and secondary metabolism were obviously altered in the ams anther, consistent with morphological defects.

interestingly,  <dig> genes located on chloroplast dna were reduced in expression in the ams anthers whereas starch and sucrose related genes were increased . in addition, more metabolism-related genes were found with shifted expression, especially glycosyl-transferase . besides, the expression levels of genes with putative regulatory functions were also changed, such as kinases and transcription factors . interestingly, most of the genes encoding kinases with expression shifts were activated in the ams mutant, suggesting a putative negative regulatory role of ams .

in addition, we found that genes likely involved in vesicular transport were up-regulated in ams, including genes encoding two snare proteins and others related to this process:  <dig> syntaxins,  <dig> myosin heavy chains and  <dig> clathrin proteins . intracellular trafficking machinery such as snare complex is important in animal and plant development  <cit> ; for example, one snare protein, sec <dig>  is preferentially expressed in the flower and essential for gametophyte development  <cit> . other vesicular transport genes, such as atvam <dig> encoding a syntaxin-related protein, were shown to function in vacuolar assembly in arabidopsis  <cit> . it is possible that the higher than normal expression of genes for vesicular transport contributes to the abnormally vacuolated tapetal cells observed in the ams anther  <cit> .

we also found that the expression levels of stress-responsive genes were changed in ams , especially the increased expression of  <dig> disease resistance genes and two genes encoding respiratory burst oxidases. these findings are consistent with recent studies showing that multiple abiotic stresses can lead to male sterility, such as extreme temperatures and drought  <cit> . in addition, some stress-inducible and/or hormone-related genes were also found with expression alteration, including rd <dig>  an aba-inducible gene responsive to dehydration; vsp <dig>  a ja-inducible gene; eps <dig>  a gene possibly acting upstream of sa; ccr <dig>  a cold inducible gene; four disease resistance genes encoding tir-nbs-lrr class proteins; and three heat-shock genes, suggesting complex interactions between internal and external signals regulating anther development and/or functions  <cit> .

another regulatory pathway activated in ams is the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway , with increased expression of genes encoding subunits of the e <dig> ubiquitin ligases   <cit> . previous studies demonstrated essential roles of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in embryogenesis, hormone signaling, light response, floral development, self-incompatibility, and senescence  <cit> . our results suggested that this pathway may also be regulated by ams. it is possible that ams directly regulates the expression of some genes in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway; alternatively, ams could influence the expression of such genes indirectly either via ams-target genes or possibly through the accumulation of damaged proteins which then induce the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway  <cit> . further experiments are needed to test these hypotheses.

anther-specific or preferential genes were over-represented among genes differentially expressed in the ams mutant
differential expression patterns in vegetative and floral organs can provide clues about gene functions  <cit> . to find out the relationship between the gene expression shifts in the ams mutant and their expression preferences in different organs, we compared our data from wild-type anther with previous microarray data from roots, stems, leaves, seedlings, siliques and inflorescences. the same rna extraction method and ath <dig> platform were applied in both studies so the datasets should be comparable  <cit> . we defined as anther-specific  using these criteria: 1) the expression in anther is significantly higher than in any other tissue ; 2) the expression is present in anther but not in any other tissues according to two alternative methods   <cit> . using the presence call of the mas <dig> algorithm identified  <dig> a-s genes,  <dig> of which had at least two fold difference; using expression level of  <dig> as threshold identified  <dig> a-s genes,  <dig> of which had at least two fold difference . because both methods for calling "presence" have limitations, only the  <dig> genes detected by both methods were discussed as a-s gene .

genes were defined as anther-preferential  if the expression in the anther is: 1) significantly higher than those in any other tissue with fdr <  <dig>   present in anther according to the mas <dig> algorithm or with expression level of at least  <dig>  therefore, a-p genes included a-s genes. in addition, those with statistically significantly higher expression levels in anther than in non-floral organs were called reproductive preferential  genes . we performed real-time pcr for  <dig> of these genes and the results were consistent . in our result,  <dig> genes involved in male reproductive development were detected . consistent with previous studies, spl was found in the a-p group and ems <dig> in r-p group, while ams as an a-s gene  <cit> .

"wt", wild-type; "s/w", fold change of the spl signals compared with wild-type; "e/w", of ems1; "a/w", of ams. a-s represents anther specific; a-p represents anther preferential  and r-p represents reproductive preferential . all expression values are log <dig> ratio. "dev" means "development" 

recently, other studies were conducted to identify male reproductive development-related genes. wellmer et al. identified genes expressed in stamen indirectly by comparing the inflorescence transcriptome of floral homeotic mutants lacking stamens with wild-type  <cit> . in another study, honys et al. analyzed microspores/pollen from different stages and defined the male gametophytic transcriptome  <cit> . a comparison of our a-p genes with these two previous gene lists  revealed that only a small number of genes overlapped between the three male reproductive datasets . the differences in identified genes can be explained by the difference of samples used in different studies: our samples only included wild-type anthers at early stages , whereas the pollen transcriptome data were from microspores and pollen at different stages; and stamen-specific genes was indirectly obtained by subtraction of mutant transcriptome from wild-type and genes in this list might function earlier during organ specification. the dramatic differences between different samples suggest strongly that gene activities alter dramatically between different developmental stages of male reproductive organs  <cit> .

we analyzed the go categorization for possible enrichment of specific categories among the groups of differentially expressed genes  and found that, among the  <dig> a-p genes, the over-represented go categories were hydrolases, proteins with other binding activities, and other enzymes. no enrichment of other enzyme activity was detected in pollen-specific or stamen-specific datasets found previously  <cit> , suggesting a specific expression profile of early anther development.

among genes with differential expression in ams, the percentage of a-p genes  is significantly higher than its percentage in the whole genome  . the stamen-specific genes were also enriched among those differentially expressed in ams  compared with whole genome data  . the results were consistent with our hypothesis that ams regulates genes with important functions in male-reproductive organ where they have higher expression levels  <cit> .

genome-wide analysis of gene expression during early anther development by comparing anther transcriptomes of male sterile mutants, spl, ems <dig>  and ams
previous studies revealed essential roles of spl and ems <dig> in early anther development and ath <dig> microarray data from anthers of these mutants at stage 4- <dig> were collected and analyzed  <cit> . to obtain a better overview of early anther development, we analyzed the anther transcriptome data from this study with those of spl and ems <dig> .  <dig>  and  <dig> genes were identified as differentially expressed in spl and ems <dig>  respectively, contributing to a total of  <dig>  genes that were differentially expressed by 2-fold or more between the wild-type anther and one or more of the spl, ems <dig> and ams mutant anthers . using the log <dig> values of the ratio of expression of the differentially expressed genes, hierarchical clustering was carried out to obtain heat-maps . the patterns of spl and ems <dig> were similar whereas ams had a different pattern, consistent with the fact that the tapetum layer is absent in both spl and ems <dig> but is formed in the ams anther.

in addition, we compared the direction of differential gene expression by pair-wise comparison between different mutants, as shown in venn diagrams  and found that many more genes showed changes in the same direction in all three mutants than genes with changes in the opposite direction, suggesting that the three transcription factors had similar effects on some of the target genes. we also found that the non-overlapping  percentage of differentially expressed genes in ams  is larger than those in spl and ems <dig> , providing strong evidence at the transcriptome level that the ams function was distinct from those of spl and ems <dig> and likely regulates late gene expression in anther development, consistent with other studies  <cit> .

because the three mutants showed related but distinct phenotypes, we speculate that the functions of genes differentially expressed in these mutants might differ from each other. thus we applied go categorization of molecular function to genes up- or down-regulated in each mutant . first, genes annotated to have "other binding activities" and "other enzyme activities" were significantly enriched in categories with reduced expression in each mutant , consistent with previous knowledge of dynamic metabolism in tapetum cells. in addition, genes encoding transcription factors and dna binding proteins are enriched in categories with both up-and down-regulated genes in the spl mutant, suggesting that spl control anther development at least in part by regulating genes encoding transcription factors. furthermore, the ams mutant showed reduced expression of many genes encoding structural proteins, which mainly contribute to cell structural integrity, suggesting that ams might activate these genes to promote maturation of tapetum cells.

spl and ems <dig> might control tapetum development by activating ams-dependent gene expression
to gain a better understanding of genes that may function together in anther development, we divided the  <dig>  genes into different clusters based on their expression patterns. totally  <dig> genes had repressed expression in all three mutants . since tapetum cells are either absent or dysfunctional in the mutants, we expected that the expression of tapetum-related genes would reduce significantly. previous studies indicated that tapetal cells were primarily involved in nutrition and material provision for pollen maturation  <cit> . consistent with this notion, genes encoding enzymes in this group  are obviously over-represented comparing with all genes on ath <dig> chip . besides, genes belonging to the other binding category were also enriched in this group .

among these genes, many of them are involved in biosynthesis of pollen wall-related compounds, such as lipids, lignin and flavonoids. a recent study showed that the loss of acyl-coa synthetase, ghacs <dig> , which might be involved in biosynthesis and transfer of lipids, can lead to male sterility in cotton  <cit> . the expression levels of  <dig> arabidopsis genes involved in the lipid metabolism pathway were significantly reduced in the three mutants, suggesting their potential roles in metabolism in tapetal cells . besides, we found that the expression levels of  <dig> genes involved in endomembrane system decreased in all mutants . recent studies in plants suggested that many endomembrane proteins might be involved in trafficking thus influencing signal transduction and development  <cit> . based on the observation of tapetum defects in all three mutants  <cit> , we speculate that genes sharing similar expression patterns might be important for maintaining the tapetum identity.

all the expression values are log <dig> ratio.

all the expression values are log <dig> ratio.

in addition, five genes for potential transcription factors were also found in this category . among them, at5g <dig> and agl25/at5g <dig> are a-p genes. at5g <dig> has a putative function in pathogen defense reaction, uncovering a possible factor in both anther development and external biotic stress response pathways  <cit> . agl <dig>  also known as flc, is a repressor of flowering and its expression is epigenetically regulated  <cit> . however, its possible function in anther development is not known. three others were agl40/at4g <dig>  myb80/at5g <dig> and hat9/at2g <dig>  agl <dig> was found in the proliferative endosperm transcriptome and myb80/at5g <dig> in tapetum development  <cit> . these results suggested that normal tapetum functions might require multiple transcription factors preferentially expressed in the anther downstream of ams.

all the expression values are log <dig> ratio. sea-l includes genes whose expression levels were reduced in all three mutants. se- l include genes whose expression levels were reduced in both spl and ems <dig> mutants.

spl and ems <dig> can regulate early anther development by ams-independent pathways
moreover,  <dig> genes showed reduced expression in spl and ems <dig> but not in ams , including the enrichment of the categories of hydrolase activity , other binding activity , and other enzyme activity . among the genes in this cluster, four genes: ms <dig>  acos <dig>  cyp703a <dig> and a <dig>  were involved in sporopollenin monomer biosynthesis, the lack of which leads to male sterility   <cit> . since these genes were not affected in the ams mutant, some lipid metabolic genes might be activated independent of ams and they might exert functions earlier than ams or in parallel to ams  <cit> .

besides, several genes encoding putative transcription factors were found within this subset . a-p genes with known functions, such as tdf1/at3g <dig>  and bhlh89/at1g <dig>  were also identified in this category  <cit> . tdf <dig> is essential to the tapetum function controlling callose dissolution and acts downstream of spl and upstream of ams and myb <dig>   <cit> . our data also support the regulatory hierarchy of spl-tdf1-ams.

the expression of ams is significantly reduced in spl, therefore we assumed that genes down-regulated in ams should have similar reduction in spl. interestingly, we found that  <dig> genes showed opposite expression changes in spl and in ams compared with wild type anther, and even larger proportion  only differentially expressed in ams . another gene with reduced expression in spl and ems <dig> mutants is dyt <dig>  which encodes a bhlh protein similar to ams  <cit> . it is possible that spl might also regulate anther development through pathways independent of ams, such as those requiring dyt <dig> function  <cit> . we speculate that spl might activate other transcription factors that affect ams-regulated genes in contrast to the function of ams . the effects of ams reduction in spl might be outweighed by the loss of × or y; such regulatory interactions would explain the opposite expression changes in spl and ams. the identification and understanding of the proposed factors will require further investigations.

ams-dependent and independent anther expression of genes encoding transcription factors
expression of bhlh genes during anther development
since many transcription factors have been found to play key roles in regulating anther development, we analyzed our anther transcriptome profiles by focusing on transcription factor gene families  <cit> . to identify additional candidate genes for anther development, we analyzed all  <dig> known bhlh genes in arabidopsis   <cit> . for several clades according to the most recent phylogeny trees of bhlh family  <cit> , including the clade that includes ams, all or most members of the same clade were expressed similarly in the anther , suggesting conserved functional roles in anther development. for example, bhlh <dig> and bhlh <dig> shared similar reductions in all three mutants, suggesting possible redundant functions in the anther .

in other cases, the closely related homologs did not share similar expression patterns in mutant vs. wild type anthers . for example, bhlh <dig> is a close homolog of ams; but unlike ams, it was preferentially expressed in the inflorescence compared with the anther. also unlike ams, it was elevated in expression in spl. it is possible that some compensatory mechanisms might act to increase transcription of bhlh <dig> when ams is mutated .

in addition, some bhlh genes with known functions in other organs showed increased expression in the spl mutant, suggesting that spl acts to maintain the identity of male reproductive organ by reducing the expression of genes needed for other organs. for example, zcw <dig>  controls petal formation and was activated in the spl anther  <cit> , suggesting that spl can promote the normal anther development at an early stage by repressing some genes normally expressed in nearby whorls.

possible role of mads-box genes in anther development
genes of the mads-box family have been extensively studied in arabidopsis, because they were first identified as flower homeotic genes that determine floral organ and meristem identities  <cit> . till now, more than one hundred mads-box genes have been identified,  <dig> of which were found to be present in our anther microarray data but most were non-anther-specific   <cit> . except for apetala <dig> , majority of genes involved in the abcde model belong to the mads family  <cit> . they are mostly inflorescence-preferential rather than anther-specific genes from the comparison of microarray data as described above. apetala <dig>  is an a function gene controlling the first and second whorls and no expression shift was observed  <cit> . apetala <dig>  and pistillata  are both b function genes, essential for the formation of petals and stamens  <cit> . interestingly, their expression patterns were different. pi is an anther-preferential gene, but its expression level did not change in any mutant while ap <dig> was obviously up-regulated in spl, suggesting that ap <dig> is regulated more tightly than pi during anther development . ag, the c class gene controlling both stamen and carpel identities, shared similar expression patterns in the anther with ap <dig>  <cit> , supporting a role of ag in anther development after the specification of stamen identity .

moreover, d class genes, including stk/at4g <dig>  shp1/at3g <dig> and shp2/at2g <dig> , are important for ovule development  <cit> . although the expression of d class genes was relatively low, we observed increased expression of shp <dig> in the ams mutant, suggesting a possible negative regulatory role of ams in ovule development. on the other hand, e class genes, sep <dig>  sep <dig>  sep <dig> and sep <dig>  which are homologs that have redundant functions, had different expression pattern in the anthers. sep <dig> and sep <dig> were activated in spl and ams, whereas sep <dig> and sep <dig> did not change much .

beside the abcde genes, some other mads genes were also expressed in the anther . the expression levels of known flowering-time related genes   <cit>  were reduced in spl and ems <dig> slightly. ful involved in fruit development  <cit>  was up-regulated in the spl and ems <dig> mutants, suggesting negative roles of spl and ems <dig> in whorl  <dig>  agl <dig>  important for central cell and endosperm formation in female gametophytes  <cit> , was also reduced in all three mutants, suggesting a possible role in male gametophyte .

differential expression of myb genes in three mutants
in addition to the bhlh and mads-box families, other gene families are also involved in anther development. as the largest arabidopsis transcription factor family, myb genes play important roles in controlling many cellular processes, such as secondary metabolism, morphogenesis, and signal transduction   <cit> . previous studies revealed a number of roles of myb genes in early anther development . for example, gamyb in rice functions in anther development via ga signaling pathway  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the gamyb homologs myb <dig> and myb <dig> also share a redundant function regulating tapetum differentiation  <cit> . our microarray results indicated that expression of myb <dig> and myb <dig> was reduced only in spl, not in the other two mutants, implying that the functions of myb <dig> and myb <dig> are independent of ems <dig> or ams.

in addition, myb35/tdf <dig> and myb80/myb <dig> controlling callose dissolution and exine formation  <cit>  were reduced in spl and ems <dig>  and myb <dig> was also down-regulated in ams, suggesting that it acts downstream of ams. moreover, the myb <dig> and myb <dig> genes that regulate phenylpropanoid metabolism  <cit>  showed a similar expression pattern to that of myb35/tdf <dig>  myb26/ms <dig> and myb <dig> are closely related homologs; both were down-regulated in spl but up-regulated in ams. previous study suggested that myb <dig> is required for endothecium thickening and anther dehiscence  <cit> . rna in situ hybridization revealed that myb <dig> as well as myb <dig> are expressed in late tapetum  <cit> , consistent with our findings of the changes of their expression in the mutant anthers.

expression of wrky, bzip, ap2/erf and nac genes
the wrky family contains at least  <dig> members in arabidopsis  <cit>  and has diverse functions, such as abiotic and biotic stress response, hormone signaling pathway, immune response and development in plants  <cit> . however, it is not known whether wrky genes are important for flower development. here we compared the expression of all wrky genes on the ath <dig> chip and found that  <dig> of them were expressed in the anther , with the highly similar wrky2/at5g <dig> and wrky32/at4g <dig>  <cit>  being anther-preferential. moreover, wrky <dig> was down-regulated in spl, suggesting that it might function downstream of spl in anther development.

we also analyzed bzip, erf and nac families of transcription factors. like the wrky family, most genes in these families do not have known functions in reproductive development . however, we found several of them were differentially expressed in the anthers of male sterile mutants, suggesting they are components of a complex transcriptional network regulating anther development.

transcriptional regulatory network for anther development
genetic studies and our transcriptomic analyses reported here support an emerging transcriptional network . previous molecular genetic studies showed that spl up-regulates the expression of ems <dig> and dyt <dig>  which are upstream of ams  <cit> , as well as other genes encoding transcription factors shown to be important in anther development  <cit> . spl also negatively regulates the expression of b and c function genes in the anther, as well as some genes that are normally expressed in petals and carpals, probably to prevent anther from developing traits of other floral organs. in addition, the key position of spl in anther regulatory hierarchy as indicated by genetic studies is supported by its effects on the anther transcriptome .

ems <dig> also positively regulates the expression of dyt <dig>  <cit> . ems <dig> was shown to interact with its putative ligand tpd <dig>  <cit> , thereby regulating genes essential for the differentiation of tapetum cells. in addition, some genes important for meiosis are also affected in the ems <dig> mutant. for example, the mmd and roxy <dig> genes that are important in anther lobe formation and meiosis, respectively, were significantly reduced in ems <dig> .

ams was down-regulated in spl and ems <dig> according to the microarray data. because dyt <dig> and ams are related bhlh proteins, which are known to form homodimers or heterodimers with other bhlh proteins, we propose that they probably regulate the expression of different genes by forming different complex with other proteins. dyt <dig> is also a putative candidate that exerts opposite function as × and/or y downstream of spl in anther development by interact with different proteins . this proposed transcriptional regulatory network of anther development is based on information from genetics, transcriptomics, and phylogenetics studies . the hypothesized interactions, including the roles of some functionally redundant genes, could be tested by further experiments.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we identified genes whose expression was changed in spl, ems <dig> and ams at anther stage 4- <dig> and further categorized these genes according to their expression patterns. these genes might directly regulate some fundamental biological processes during anther development. in addition, both anther-specific and non-anther-specific genes are identified in anther development. transcriptome analyses also showed ams-dependent and -independent pathways. careful analyses of transcriptome combined with genetic and phylogenetic information revealed an elaborate regulatory network during early anther development and expanded our understanding of the hierarchy of anther-development-related genes, especially transcription factors.
