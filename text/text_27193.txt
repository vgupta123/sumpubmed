BACKGROUND
cell walls are major components of plant cells that impact significantly on the modes of cell development and the growth and the mechanical properties of plant organs. plant cell walls are also of considerable economic significance in that they are major components of terrestrial biomass and of plant-derived materials that are used for fibre, fuel and food. primary and secondary cell walls are comprised of sets of polysaccharides of considerable structural complexity and diversity  <cit> . the major polysaccharide classes are cellulose, hemicelluloses  and pectic polysaccharides with the latter two classes containing a diversity of polymer structures. in order to understand how specific configurations of polysaccharides and their interactions and associations constitute diverse cell wall structures and functions, methodologies are required to assess polymers in-situ throughout organs and within cell walls. tagged proteins, with the capacity to specifically bind to a structural motif of a polysaccharide, are currently one of the best ways to do this. these proteins are most notably monoclonal antibodies and carbohydrate-binding modules. cell wall probes, directed to some structural features of polymers of the three major polysaccharide classes have indicated that the occurrence of cell wall polysaccharide structures can be highly regulated in relation to developmental context  <cit> . however, probes are not yet available for all the structural motifs known to occur within cell wall components and thus in-situ locations of all polymer structures cannot yet be determined.

xyloglucans are one of the most abundant hemicelluloses of the primary cell walls of non-graminaceous species and are proposed to have a functional role in hydrogen bonding to and tethering the cellulose microfibrils together. this load-bearing hemicellulosic network maintains the strength of primary cell walls which is a crucial factor underpinning expansive plant growth  <cit> . the xyloglucan set of hemicelluloses is highly diverse and displays significant taxonomic variation in structure  <cit> . xyloglucans have a backbone of -β-d-glucan and some glucosyl residues are substituted with short side chains. a structure-based nomenclature has been developed for xyloglucan-derived oligosaccharides to indicate the attachments to backbone glucosyl sequences  <cit> . for example, an unbranched glucosyl residue is designated g, a glucosyl residue bearing a single xylose is designated x and one bearing a disaccharide of β-gal--α-xyl is designated l. xyloglucans are classified as xxxg or xxgg type based on the number of backbone residues that carry side chains with the xxxg type having three consecutive glucosyl residues with xylose attached and a fourth unbranched residue  <cit> . to date it has not been easy to put this structural complexity into cell biological context as only few probes are available. an antiserum to xyloglucan  <cit>  and a monoclonal antibody  that binds to a fucosylated epitope that is carried by xyloglucan  <cit>  have been developed. these have been used to detect xyloglucan in-situ  <cit> .

here we describe the coupling of a heptasaccharide with  <dig> xylosyl and  <dig> glucosyl residues  obtained from tamarind seed xyloglucan to a protein carrier to act as an immunogen. subsequent to immunization we have identified a rat monoclonal antibody, designated lm <dig>  that binds to the xxxg motif of xyloglucan and we have used this antibody to demonstrate the regulation of xyloglucan structure and occurrence within cell walls and in relation to plant anatomy in a range of species.

polysaccharides do not exist in isolation in plant cell walls and understanding the links and associations between classes of polymers is an important goal to increase our understanding of plant cell wall biology. biochemical evidence is accumulating that xyloglucan can be attached to pectic polymers in plant cell walls  <cit> . using enzymatic degradation to remove the pectic homogalacturonan  from cell walls of transverse sections of plant materials in conjunction with the lm <dig> anti-xyloglucan monoclonal antibody we have demonstrated the existence of developmentally regulated sets of xyloglucan epitopes within cell walls that are masked by the presence of hg. this observation has significant implications for our understanding of the precise developmental patterns of occurrence of xyloglucan in cell walls and of cell wall biology in general.

RESULTS
selection of a xxxg-directed xyloglucan monoclonal antibody
to understand xyloglucan structure in the context of plant cell development a set of probes covering aspects of xyloglucan structure is required. as the xxxg oligosaccharide is a major motif of xyloglucans a specific monoclonal antibody probe directed to this motif was generated. the xxxg heptasaccharide from tamarind seed xyloglucan was coupled to bsa by reductive amination. subsequent to immunization with this neoglycoprotein immunogen, fusion products were screened by elisas using tamarind xyloglucan as the antigen. several cell lines were selected that bound effectively to tamarind xyloglucan and one, secreting a rat igg2c monoclonal antibody and designated lm <dig>  was selected for full characterization. the binding of lm <dig> to tamarind seed xyloglucan and the xxxg-bsa neoglycoprotein in an elisa is shown in fig.  <dig>  to determine the specificity of lm <dig> recognition of xyloglucan and to assess its possible binding to other cell wall polymers, lm <dig> was used to probe glycan microarrays in which large numbers of plant cell wall polysaccharides were assembled  <cit> . a representative result is shown in fig.  <dig> and indicates that there is little recognition of cell wall polymers other than a sample of tamarind xyloglucan  and pea xyloglucan . the low level of binding to pectic polymer samples and gums tragacanth and karaya is possibly due to low levels of xyloglucan in these extracted samples. samples of extracts of organs of the model plant arabidopsis thaliana were also included in the microarray  <cit>  and recognition of these was greater for the alkali-solubilised materials rather than cation chelator-solubilised materials – a pattern that would be expected for xyloglucan  <cit> .

the binding of lm <dig> to tamarind seed xyloglucan in elisa and in the context of the glycan microarray indicated that it bound specifically to this class of cell wall polymer. in order to confirm this and to determine the structural features required for binding, the inhibition of lm <dig> binding to tamarind seed xyloglucan by the presence of a range of xyloglucan-derived and related oligosaccharides was determined using competitive-inhibition  elisas. when lm <dig> hybridoma supernatant was used at 100-fold dilution in an assay with tamarind seed xyloglucan-coated elisa plates, the most effective hapten inhibitor was the xxxg oligosaccharide as shown in a representative competitive inhibition elisa in fig.  <dig>  the concentration of the xxxg oligosaccharide required to inhibit lm <dig> binding by 50% was  <dig>  μg/ml. equivalent inhibition was achieved with  <dig>  μg/ml of a mixture of xxlg and xlxg isomers ,  <dig> μg/ml xllg and  <dig> μg/ml of the gggg cellotetraose. these data indicate that the presence of two galactosyl residues to a large extent prevented recognition of the xyloglucan oligosaccharides by lm <dig>  although one galactosyl residue was more readily tolerated. isoprimeverose glc) and a xylose disaccharide xyl) had no impact on lm <dig> binding to xyloglucan when present at  <dig> mg/ml. in summary, we have generated a monoclonal antibody to the xxxg structural motif of xyloglucan. this probe was used to explore xyloglucan structure and occurrence in relation to plant cell types and cell wall microstructures.

xyloglucan in cell walls of cotyledon parenchyma of tamarind and nasturtium seeds
xyloglucan is known to be a major structural component of the cell walls of the cotyledon parenchyma of tamarind and nasturtium seeds  <cit> . to explore the binding of the xxxg-directed monoclonal antibody lm <dig> to plant cell walls, excised cotyledon parenchyma tissue from mature seeds of these two species were fixed and embedded in resin and sectioned prior to indirect immunofluorescence analysis. the mouse monoclonal antibody ccrcm <dig>  <cit>  that binds to a fucosylated epitope of xyloglucan  was used for comparison with lm <dig> 

a comparison of lm <dig> binding and calcofluor white staining of tamarind seed cotyledon parenchyma indicated that lm <dig> bound throughout the cell walls, including the extensive cell wall thickenings of the cotyledon parenchyma . in contrast, ccrcm <dig> did not bind to these cell walls although it did bind to non-thickened cell walls of the vascular tissue . tamarind belongs to the family fabaceae in the order fabales. xyloglucan is also an abundant storage polymer in seeds of nasturtium belonging to the family tropaeolaceae in the order brassicales. the binding of lm <dig> and ccrcm <dig> to nasturtium seed cotyledon parenchyma cell walls is shown in fig.  <dig> and indicates recognition of distinct regions of the seed parenchyma cell walls. lm <dig> bound to the thickened regions of cell walls and most strongly to the outer regions next to middle lamellae . in contrast, the ccrcm <dig> epitope was less abundant and variable in occurrence and when present it was exclusively in a thin region of the inner cell walls facing the plasma membrane .

lm <dig> binding to cell walls of tobacco and pea stems is increased by a pre-treatment with pectate lyase to remove pectic homogalacturonan
the structure of xyloglucans is taxonomically diverse with species such as pea and arabidopsis, belonging to the rosidae, having a xxxg type xyloglucan  <cit> . bright field and calcofluor white stained images of a region of a transverse section through a pea stem internode show a portion of the ring of vascular bundles  linked through interfascicular regions by a band of sclerified parenchyma or fibre cells and cortical and pith parenchymas in distal and proximal regions respectively . indirect immunofluorescence analysis of lm <dig> binding to an equivalent section of pea stem indicated that this antibody bound to a limited set of cell walls in the inner protoxylem regions of vascular bundles . there was also some weak binding to cells in the region of the phloem of the vascular bundles and to the pith parenchyma. omitting lm <dig> from the immunolabelling procedure on an equivalent section resulted in no observed fluorescence . this unexpectedly low level of recognition of the cell walls by lm <dig> was explored further by removal of pectic hg from sections by a pre-treatment with a recombinant pectate lyase. this pre-treatment led to a large increase in the detection of the lm <dig> epitope across the section and in a distinct pattern of cell walls as shown in fig. 5d, i.e. the pre-treatment of the section had exposed a set of lm <dig> epitopes. the pectate lyase pre-treatment resulted in the lm <dig> epitope being detected in abundance in the epidermal cell walls, those of the cortical and pith parenchymas and cells in the phloem region of the vascular bundles and the inner regions of the xylem strands. in pith parenchyma cells directly adjacent to cells with thickened cell walls in the interfascicular regions the occurrence of the lm <dig> epitope stopped abruptly at the junction with the fibre cell  indicating that only three of the four walls of a cell in section were labelled by the antibody. in summary, the lm <dig> epitope was detected in most cells other than cells with secondary cell walls . similar patterns of occurrence, before and after enzyme treatment were observed for the ccrcm <dig> epitope . this pattern of occurrence after enzyme treatment is similar to that of pectic hg in an equivalent section as shown by the binding of anti-hg monoclonal antibody jim <dig>  <cit>  to a section not treated with the enzyme in figure 4e. all control sections in this study not treated with pectate lyase were incubated with the high ph buffer required for maximal enzyme action. the high ph results in de-esterification of pectic hg and therefore, in this case, jim <dig> indicates the presence of hg present in cell walls independent of original methyl-esterification status. the loss of the jim <dig> hg epitope from the section as a consequence of pectate lyase treatment is shown for comparison in fig. 5f.

at a tissue level the lm <dig> epitope unmasked by pectate lyase action and the jim <dig> epitope on an untreated section have a similar occurrence. to document the occurrence of the lm <dig>  pectate-lyase-unmasked lm <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes in more detail higher magnification micrographs of vascular bundles are shown in fig.  <dig>  in an untreated section the lm <dig> epitope was most abundant in cell walls of protoxylem cells, discrete domains of metaxylem cell walls and also certain cells of the phloem region that can also be identified from calcofluor white labelling to have in some cases thickened cell walls and in other cases not . in addition, the epitope was detected in cells, with the characteristics of parenchyma cells, adjacent to the smallest protoxylem cells. after pectate lyase treatment the occurrence of labelling was maintained along with the strong labelling of all cell walls in the phloem region and the cortical and pith parenchymas. the pattern of the jim <dig> epitope was similar in that it was also present in discrete domains of metaxylem cell walls but showed subtle distinctions in that it was abundant in the cambial layer between the xylem and phloem regions. in the phloem region the jim <dig> epitope did not appear throughout cell walls but at intercellular regions and was also relatively more abundant at cell corners in the cortical parenchyma in comparison with the lm <dig> epitope.

solanaceous species, belonging to the solanales of the asteridae, do not have xxxg xyloglucan but have distinct xyloglucan oligosaccharides of type xxgg and xsgg where s indicates an arabinosyl residue attached to the xylosyl residue  <cit> . lm <dig> bound weakly to cell walls in sections of tobacco stem as shown in fig.  <dig> and this was mostly to collenchyma, distinct periodic cells in the cambium and pith parenchyma adjacent to the band of xylem . pre-treatment of an equivalent section with pectate lyase to remove pectic hg increased lm <dig> binding. after hg removal, the lm <dig> epitope was detected throughout cell walls of the epidermis, the cortical collenchyma and parenchyma and also the cambium and pith parenchyma . monoclonal antibody ccrcm <dig> did not bind to tobacco stems before or after pectate lyase treatment . labelling of sections with anti-hg jim <dig> before and after section treatment with pectate lyase indicated that hg epitopes were effectively removed from the section  and also indicated that the jim <dig> hg epitope occurred more widely than the lm <dig> epitope in all cell walls of all cell types throughout the organ. to explore how a pectate lyase pre-treatment impacts on the capacity to detect other cell wall epitopes in this system, equivalent untreated and treated sections were probed with monoclonal antibody lm <dig> directed to the -α-l-arabinan, a structural motif that is often associated with the rhamnogalacturonan-i polysaccharide of pectin  <cit> . this antibody bound in a similar pattern to epidermal cells, cortical and pith parenchymas before and after treatment with pectate lyase although the fluorescence signal was more intense after pectate lyase treatment .

a more detailed comparative analysis of the lm <dig> and jim <dig> epitopes in cortical regions where collenchyma cells merge into parenchyma cells is shown in fig.  <dig>  the lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope, revealed by pectate lyase pre-treatment, occurred throughout collenchyma wall thickenings but was most abundant in cell wall regions adjacent to middle lamellae, a pattern of occurrence that was maintained in the cortical parenchyma . in contrast, the jim <dig> hg epitope was distributed evenly across thickened collenchyma cell walls and some cases a stronger abundance at the inner cell wall adjacent to the plasma membrane was observed. the epitope was particularly abundant in cell walls lining the intercellular spaces in the parenchyma cells. in the pith parenchyma , enzymatic removal of pectic hg uncovered the lm <dig> epitope throughout the cell wall but a particularly abundant occurrence was always observed in this tissue at the junctions between adhered and unadhered cell walls at intercellular spaces . in contrast, the jim <dig> hg epitope was most abundant in cell walls lining the entire intercellular spaces . in the section preparation used for this study, certain cells were viewed not only in section across longitudinal walls but were observed in addition to present intact inner surfaces of transversal cell walls – see asterisk in fig. 9a. immunocytochemical analysis of such walls can provide an additional insight in to cell wall microstructures  <cit> . higher magnification of these regions of the inner face of cell walls with calcofluor white fluorescence  revealed regions with reduced fluorescence, that are possibly pit fields. these regions displayed more lm <dig> fluorescence relative to regions showing strong calcofluor white fluorescence . a similar differential labelling of regions showing strong and weak fluorescence with calcofluor white was shown by jim <dig> although this was less marked .

discussion
we show that immunization with a neoglycoprotein has been successful in the generation of a rat monoclonal antibody, lm <dig>  directed to the xxxg motif of xyloglucan that can bind effectively to tamarind xyloglucan  and also to cell walls in a range of species. lm <dig> can bind to pea cell walls  and also to tobacco stem cell walls with xxgg xyloglucan indicating that the lm <dig> antibody may not require the entire heptasaccharide xxxg for optimal recognition – a facet of lm <dig> binding to xyloglucan that was also indicated by hapten oligosaccharide inhibition studies in which a mixture of xxlg and xlxg oligosaccharides was observed to effectively inhibit binding.

polysaccharide-directed probes such as monoclonal antibodies are important tools to gain an understanding of polysaccharide diversity and occurrence in cell walls which is an essential aspect of understanding the molecular basis of cell wall functions. a xyloglucan antiserum  <cit>  and a monoclonal antibody ccrcm <dig>  <cit>  have been used to demonstrate developmentally regulated patterns of xyloglucan occurrence in a range of systems  <cit> . in sections of nasturtium seed monoclonal antibodies lm <dig> and ccrcm <dig> bound to distinct regions of cotyledon parenchyma cell walls indicating the spatial regulation of xyloglucan structure within these cell walls. a region of the nasturtium cell walls between the regions bound by these antibodies  was not strongly bound by either probe . to know whether xyloglucan is reduced in amount or the xyloglucan is structurally distinct in these regions requires the development of probes for other structural features of xyloglucans.

binding of lm <dig> to untreated transverse sections of stem internodes of pea and tobacco indicated recognition of only a few cell types and often weakly. binding was shown to be increased considerably by the enzymatic removal of pectic hg. in cell wall immunochemistry studies, it is often assumed that a section through an organ/cell and thus across cell wall layers from the plasma membrane to the middle lamella would expose all polymers present in the cell walls. the implication, from many documented occurrences of cell wall epitopes, has been that a restricted occurrence of an epitope reflected the presence or absence of a particular epitope and this has in some cases been supported by physicochemical analysis of isolated polymers. this is the first report of a clear case of substantial epitope masking where most of the copies of an epitope present in a section have been masked by the presence of another cell wall polymer, in this case pectic hg. it is of considerable interest that, in both pea and tobacco stem internodes, some xyloglucan epitopes were detected without enzymatic removal of pectic hg in addition to those revealed by pectic hg removal. this suggests the possibility of two distinct presentations of the lm <dig> epitope in relation to pectin in cell walls. these observations have important implications for our understanding of cell wall polymer configurations and should be born in mind when considering the developmental regulation of cell wall structures, as evidenced by antibody probes.

the basis of the uncovering of xyloglucan epitopes by pectic hg removal could be a general increase in cell wall porosity allowing increased access to epitopes or alternatively an intimate specific structural association between pectin and xyloglucan in muro that occludes xyloglucan structures. the comparative assessment of the lm <dig> arabinan epitope in tobacco stem indicated that its detection increased after pectate lyase treatment but not to the extent observed for the lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope. moreover, no difference in the pattern of occurrence of the lm <dig> epitope was revealed. this observation suggests that the pectate lyase pre-treatment can increase cell wall porosity and thus all antibody access to some extent. however, the clear impact on the extent and pattern of lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope detection indicates a more intimate association between xyloglucan and pectin in this system.

pectin and xyloglucan are both quantitatively important polymers of plant cell walls comprising approximately a third each of the polysaccharides of primary cell walls of dicotyledons  <cit> . in terms of cell wall architectures, xyloglucan is known to attach to cellulose microfibrils by means of hydrogen bonds and is proposed to tether adjacent microfibrils providing the mechanical basis of the resisting cell enlargement. the complex pectic network of several polymers  embeds the cellulose-xyloglucan network and imposes cell wall properties including cell wall porosity  <cit> . an early model of cell wall structure proposed a glycosidic link between xyloglucan and a neutral side chain of pectin  <cit> . recent evidence has confirmed a link between xyloglucan and acidic pectic polymers but specifically through the rhamnogalacturonan-i domains of the pectic molecules  <cit> . these studies indicate that such links are widespread and, in the case of cultured cells of arabidopsis, evidence has been reported that up to 50% of xyloglucan is synthesized on a pectic primer prior to cell wall deposition and that the interpolymer bonds are stable in the cell wall  <cit> . the significance of glycosidic links between pectic polymers and xyloglucan and the observations reported here are not yet clear.

in cell walls of pea and tobacco stem internodes the pectic hg and the lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope do not co-localize precisely. it is of interest that the uncovered lm <dig> xyloglucan epitopes occurred in diverse complex patterns in relation to cell wall features and microstructures in a range of cell types such as parenchyma, metaxylem and collenchyma cells. in many cases the lm <dig> epitope was not evenly distributed throughout cell walls. at the inner face of transverse walls in the pith parenchyma of tobacco stem the lm <dig> epitope did not co-localize with calcofluor white fluorescence . other approaches have indicated that cellulose microfibrils may not be evenly coated with xyloglucan, that xyloglucan can occur in distinct cell wall domains and may be minimal in some cell walls  <cit> . it has also been demonstrated that xyloglucan structure changes during cell growth in pea  <cit>  and it is possible that structural changes are spatially regulated within cell walls during cell development. the detection of abundant lm <dig> xyloglucan epitope at corners of intercellular spaces, shown most strikingly in this study for tobacco pith parenchyma cell walls, is a pattern of occurrence that has been observed for the lm <dig> pectic hg epitope in a wide range of parenchyma systems  <cit> . this may indicate, for this tissue, a role for xyloglucan in intercellular space formation or stabilisation, possibly through an association with pectin.

CONCLUSIONS
a novel xyloglucan binding rat monoclonal antibody lm <dig> has been developed for xyloglucan analysis in planta. the demonstration that, in certain organs, large sets of xyloglucan epitopes are masked by the presence of pectic hg has implications for understanding xyloglucan function in primary cell walls and cell wall biology in general. the use of enzymic degradation in conjunction with cell wall probes is likely to be an important analytical tool for the study of the developmental regulation of links between pectic polymers and xyloglucan. further work will be required to dissect the extent of cell wall epitope masking occurring between other sets of cell wall polysaccharides.
