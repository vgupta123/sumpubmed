BACKGROUND
in recent years, concerns about fossil fuel supplies and prices have motivated the search for renewable biofuels. with the existing technologies and current costs of fuel transportation, ethanol from sugarcane is the most viable alternative. in some countries, including brazil, sugarcane is planted with low amounts of nitrogen fertilizers and there is evidence that the use of low levels of nitrogen can be compensated by biological nitrogen fixation   <cit> . although several organisms are capable of contributing to bnf, it has been shown that the diazotroph alphaproteobacteria gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus pal <dig> , present in large numbers in the intercellular space of sugarcane roots, stem and leaves, fixes n <dig> inside sugarcane plants, without causing apparent disease  <cit> . remarkable characteristics of this bacterium are the acid tolerance, the inability to use nitrate as sole nitrogen source and the ability to fix nitrogen in the presence of ammonium in medium with high sugar concentration  <cit> . although isolation of gdi from the sugarcane rhizosphere has been reported  <cit> , its poor survival soil and complete absence in soil samples collected between sugarcane rows strongly support the endophytic nature of this nitrogen fixing bacterium  <cit> . in addition to bnf, gdi has other characteristics that contribute to its biotechnological importance: 1-) a nif- mutant enhances plant growth, particularly in roots, indicating that gdi secretes plant growth-promoting substances  <cit> ; 2-) it produces a lysozyme-like bacteriocin that inhibits the growth of the sugarcane pathogen xanthomonas albilineans  <cit> ; 3-) it has antifungal activity against fusarium sp. and helminthosporium carbonum  <cit> ; 4-) gdi promotes an increase in the solubility of phosphate and zinc  <cit> . besides its biotechnological features, the genome is especially interesting be-cause is the third diazotrophic endophytic bacteria to be completed sequenced. the first two diazotrophic endophytes to be sequenced, azoarcus sp. strain bh <dig>  <cit>  and klebsiella pneumoniae  <dig>  <cit> , belong to the betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria classes, respectively. thus, the genome of gdi is the first to be completely sequence from alphaproteobacteria class. here we report the complete genome sequence of the g. diazotrophicus strain pal <dig>  sequence analyzes show the existence of a large accessory genome, probably originated by extensive horizontal gene transfer . moreover, experimental results reveal differences in genomic islands  among g. diazotrophicus strains. the knowledge of the metabolic routes, organization and regulation of genes involved in nitrogen fixation, establishment of successful plant association and other processes should allow a better understanding of the role played by this bacterium in plant-bacteria interaction.

RESULTS
overview of the g. diazotrophicus pal <dig> genome
the complete genome of gdi is composed of one circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> base pairs  with an average g+c content of  <dig> %, and two plasmids of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively . the circular chromosome has a total of  <dig>  putative coding sequences , with an overall coding capacity of  <dig> %. among the predicted genes,  <dig>  were assigned a putative function, and  <dig>  encode hypothetical proteins. regarding noncoding rna genes,  <dig> rrnas  and  <dig> trnas were identified. the larger plasmid  has  <dig> cds; approximately 70% encode hypothetical or conserved hypothetical proteins and five encode proteins involved in plasmid-related functions. the remaining  <dig> cds encode putative components of the type iv secretion system . the small plasmid  has  <dig> cds, and around 50% are hypothetical proteins.

although today the genome databases have more than  <dig> complete microbial genomes, only nine are endophytes   <cit> . the complete genomes of endophytic bacteria reveal remarkably few mobile elements in its genome , an observation that led to the proposal that this could denote an adaptation to a more stable life style  <cit> . in contrast, gdi contains  <dig> transposable elements, more than any other endophytic bacteria . the large number of mobile elements could be a signature of a recent evolutionary bottleneck and consequent relaxation of selection, perhaps due to a recent change in niche  <cit> . alternatively, because gdi is found in low frequency at the rhizosphere, the transposable elements could have been acquired from other bacteria inhabiting the same environment. in order to identify possible specific characteristics of the genome, the predicted highly express genes  genes were identified  <cit> . phx analysis identified  <dig> cds  in gdi with e  >  <dig> . combining this information with the proteomic results  <cit> , which sequenced peptides from  <dig> genes, we identified  <dig> of these genes phx. as expected, ribosomal proteins, translation/transcription factors and chaperone/degradation genes are among the top  <dig> e values within the  <dig> cds, . however, some unexpected cds also appear as phx. for instance, there are  <dig> transporter proteins or transporter-related proteins with high e value, of which  <dig> are putative abc transporter proteins and six are putative tonb-dependent receptors. the genome has two ammonium transporter proteins  and both with high e values. two other proteins related to ammonium metabolism are also phx: a putative glutamate-ammonia-ligase adenyltransferase  and a putative histidine-ammonia-lyase . this finding is consistent with the fact that ammonium is the preferred nitrogen source for gdi when it is available.

core and accessory regions
analysis of the core and accessory regions of gdi is important in order to understand its evolution and adaptation to the plant environment  <cit> . even though pal <dig> is the first gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strain to be sequenced, it is possible to identify the core genome by comparing with closely related species. the closest completed genomes available in the database were identified by phylogenetic analysis . these include acidiphilium cryptum jf- <dig> , gluconobacter oxydans 621h  and granulibacter bethesdensis cgdnih . using quartops analysis  we identified  <dig> cds as core. most of these cds are related to metabolism, information transfer and energy metabolism, as illustrated in figure  <dig>  as cds with low gc <dig>  are potential accessory genes, the mean and standard deviation of the non-quartops were used as cut-offs to identify possible accessory genes. we found that  <dig>  cds have a gc <dig> percentage lower than 80% . interpolated variable order motifs  <cit>   were used to complement the accessory genome analysis, revealing that  <dig>  cds have an "alien score" greater than the threshold,  <dig> . the group of cds in common between gc <dig> and ivoms  was used to define the accessory genes in the genome. the percentages of conserved hypothetical proteins, hypothetical proteins, phage/is elements and pseudo genes are higher in the putative accessory regions than in the core regions and in the genome , suggesting that the putative accessory regions have been transferred horizontally into the genome. overall, the putative accessory regions cover approximately 24% of the gdi genome and are separated into  <dig> distinct regions, of which seven are classified as phage regions . a third and completely independent method, phx, also supports the assignment of the predicted accessory regions .

genome islands: variation among g. diazotrophicus strains
because hgt is an important source of intra-specific genetic variation in bacteria  <cit> , we investigated whether there are differences in putative genome islands among  <dig> g. diazotrophicus strains and one g. johannae strain, using pcr with primers designed against  <dig> single-copy genes in  <dig> genome islands , and  <dig> cds from the core genome. there was a complex variation among the strains, with gene content of eleven gis -  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> - either almost entirely conserved or less than 50% variable . in two gis -  <dig> and  <dig> - there was high variability in a group of genes, while other genes were conserved in most strains. the remaining seven gis, representing approximately 7% of the genome, were highly variable, especially gis  <dig> and  <dig>  which are  <dig> and  <dig> kb long, and encode  <dig> and  <dig> cds, respectively. furthermore, a considerable number of cds in these two gis encode genes involved in processes that could confer a competitive edge, such as oxidative stress, proteases, biosynthesis of antimicrobial agents, amino acid metabolism and secondary metabolites, as well a large number of transport systems and transcriptional regulators. both gi <dig> and gi <dig> also contain complete copies of the t4ss operon. as it has been suggested that t4ss can increase host adaptability in bartonella  <cit> , we suspected that they could be a source of intraspecific variation among g. diazotrophicus strains. a southern blot used to probe the trbe gene shows that indeed the t4ss copy number varies from one to four depending on the strain . these gis could be especially important for bacterial adaptation to the endophytic lifestyle and may confer adaptation advantages to g. diazotrophicus in comparison with other microbes that colonize the same niche.

general comparison
as the experimental results support the prediction of accessory regions in gdi, another interesting question concerns which regions of the genome resembles genomes from the database. for this purpose, a reciprocal best hits  comparison was used  <cit> . the rbh analysis indicates that only  <dig>  cdss of gdi generate a hit with a completed bacterial genome. among them,  <dig>  cdss have best hit with the alphaproteobacteria class,  <dig> with the betaproteobacteria class,  <dig> cds with the gammaproteobacteria class and  <dig> with other groups. the distribution of all rbhs demonstrated that even genes from phylogenetically distant related organisms can exhibit high percent identity . the organism with the highest number of best hits is gox, with  <dig> . however, in figure  <dig>  it is possible to observe that most of the hits occur in core regions. in the three organisms closest to gdi, around 90% of the best hits occur in core regions, with 10% in accessories regions. on the other hand, among rhizobiales and other alphaproteobacteria orders, 56% of the best hits occur in core regions and 44% in accessory regions . curiously, complete genomes from the betaproteobacteria class, gammaproteobacteria class and other groups have a significant number  of rbhs in core regions, and low percentage  in accessory regions. in addition, the number of rbhs with phytopathogenic organisms is higher in betaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria than in alphaproteobacteria .

comparisons with other endophytic bacteria
currently, there are only nine complete genome sequences of endophytic bacteria, and all are proteobacteria. using the complete genomes, we searched for common and exclusive cds among endophytic bacteria in order to identify genes that could explain the endophytic capacity. however, we found only five cds that are exclusively conserved . the comparison among the endophytic organisms indicates that gdi has more cds exclusively conserved with methylobacterium populi bj <dig>  than with the others, which is consistent with the fact that m. populi bj <dig> is also an alphaproteobacteria. most of these genes  occur in an accessory region , and many are putative transcriptional regulators and putative t4ss , which could also be involved in bacteria-host interactions. we also searched for exclusively conserved cds between gdi and azoarcus sp. bh <dig>  as these two bacteria are currently the only diazotrophs among the endophytes sequenced. the result confirmed the presence in both endophytes of the nif cluster  and genes from the putative gum cluster are only conserved within azoarcus sp. bh <dig> and gdi . an assessment of the classes and frequency of signaling cds in both diazotrophs shows that azoarcus sp. bh <dig> has acquired a far more complex set of regulators . in contrast, gdi has many more transport systems than azoarcus sp. bh <dig> . altogether, the strategy developed by gdi to interact with plants seems to be more similar to methylobacterium populi bj <dig> then to other endophytes. however, the result suggests that there is not only one strategy and probably there are different ways in which bacteria can interact with plants.

after we completed this work, a second genome sequence of gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus strain pal <dig> was deposited. we carried out extensive comparisons between the two sequences. the comparison is summarized in additional file  <dig>  the results show significant differences between the two versions. gdi-br has  <dig> more cds than gdi-us, although this number is significantly reduced when small orfs are annotated as cdss in gdi-us. likewise, the number of unique genes in both genomes decreases from  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, when the small cdss are taken into account. the results show that the transposases, integrases and hypothetical proteins can explain the majority of the differences between the two sequences. furthermore, 67% of the genes unique to gdi-br are located in genome islands. on the other hand, 85% bbh among the two sequences are found outside the gis. the results of the genomic comparisons between the two sequences are compatible with the pcr results reported here, that showed that most of the genic differences among gdi strains are situated in the gis. furthermore, when gis from the two sequences are compared, most of the genic variation is found in the same more variable gis . altogether, these analyzes suggest that the two sequences deposited as g. diazotrophicus pal <dig> strain may represent either two different strains or a fast diverging strain.

in addition, our results were corroborated by at least three independent approaches. first, southern blot analyzes confirmed that the genomic sequence we have deposited has  <dig> copies of the tss <dig> secretion system. furthermore, pcr with primers that amplified genes in the gis verified the presence of all cds in our sequence, while some like gdi <dig> which encodes a putative h/cl exchange transporter, is absent from the second sequence. finally, over  <dig> cds in our sequence were validated by proteomics  <cit> . some of these cds may confer unique biological properties and competitiveness to gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus pal <dig>  such as a bacteriocin . additional file  <dig> contains the list of blast best hits among the two gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus pal <dig> genomic sequences, a list of unique cds found in chromosome from genebank file cp <dig> and a list of unique genes found in chromosome from genebank file am <dig> .

genome features in core regions
osmotolerance
gdi supports high sugar concentrations, being able to tolerate up to 30% sucrose, but is sensitive to salt  <cit> . this shows its adaptation to sugarcane tissues, where the sucrose content is frequently high. several osmoprotection systems were found . there is a kdp sensor system kdpabcde, which regulates potassium flux   <cit> . one putative proline/betaine transporter gene was detected , but transporter genes prou, bett and opua were not found. pathways for glycine/betaine production are incomplete and genes necessary for conversion from choline to betaine are absent. the gdi genome harbors three dpp abc transporters that facilitate the uptake of di- and tripeptides . two orfs encoding a dtpt transporter, also involved in the uptake of di- and tripeptides, are present . the presence of otsa, otsb and trea homologs  suggests that gdi may synthesize and use the osmolytic disaccharide trehalose, although experiments on solid culture medium have shown that gdi is able to grow poorly on trehalose as a carbon source . the hyperosmotic sensing in gdi may occur through the two-component system envz/ompr . however, the envz-regulated porins ompf and ompc are not present. in bacteria, two porins  regulate the movement of water and aliphatic alcohols across cell membranes  <cit> . homologs of aqpz are missing in gdi, although two sets of glyceroporin genes were found in two clusters: one containing glprdfk  and the other composed of glpdkf . the mechanisms shown in figure  <dig> and discussed here are similar to those found in bacteria without the high level of tolerance to high sugar concentrations observed for g. diazotrophicus. therefore, unknown mechanisms that protect the bacteria specifically against high sugar concentrations may act in gdi. however, gdi seems to have a larger number of isoforms of enzymatic systems involved in osmotolerance. these differences may be explained by the different niches inhabited by gdi and azoarcus sp bh <dig>  while gdi is found in plants with elevated concentration of sugars, azoarcus sp bh <dig> lives in association with plants that do not accumulate carbon sources in high concentration in vegetative tissues, rice and kallar grass, and thus azoarcus sp bh <dig> may not need a large number of enzymes.

acid tolerance
gdi has high tolerance to low ph and organic acids and is able to fix nitrogen at ph values as low as  <dig>   <cit> . the acidophile acetobacter aceti has an unusual citric acid cycle  that is important for acetic acid resistance at low ph  <cit> . genome analyses revealed the presence in the gdi genome of homologs of the alternative a. aceti citrate synthase gene aara  and the gene for an acetyl-coa hydrolase family protein gene with succinyl-coa:acetate coa-transferase activity, called aarc . in gdi, the aarac homologs occur in a cluster similar to that of a. aceti, contrasting with the organization of these genes in non-acidophilic species, thus indicating that the same mechanisms of acid tolerance involving the cac may be acting in both organisms. we also found a homolog of an abc-transporter gene aata  that, in a. aceti, constitutes an organic acid efflux pump mediating resistance to several acids  <cit> . an unusual observation is the presence in the gdi genome of two copies of the chaperonin genes groes  and groel , which are usually present as single copy in bacteria. in a. aceti, overexpression of the groesl operon led to augmented resistance to acetic acid  <cit> , which may be explained by the fact that chaperonins protect proteins under denaturing conditions such as low ph  <cit> .

polysaccharides: cps, eps and lps
cell-surface components that are commonly involved in plant-bacteria interactions include capsular polysaccharides , exopolysaccharides , and lipopolysaccharide . on the gdi chromosome we found nine cds related to polysaccharide encapsulation . the gdi genome contains several cds related to lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. five cds  encode glycosyltransferases, three cds  may be involved in lipopolysaccharide transport, one cds  encodes an o-antigen polymerase, and there is an adp-heptose synthase  and a nucleotidyl transferase . seven cds  related to the synthesis of other eps such as beta-glucans and exooligosaccharides were also identified. these cds are dispersed over the gdi genome and encode exof, exoz, exoy, exoo, exop, exon and exoc, respectively. homologs of these cds are involved in the interaction between rhizobia and their host plants  <cit> . gdi has a cluster  containing  <dig> cdss that is similar to the gum cluster of azoarcus sp.bh <dig>  x. campestris and x. fastidiosa. the gum cluster in x. campestris is responsible for the synthesis of an eps that is involved in host plant colonization and virulence  <cit> . however, not all genes from the gum operon are present in gdi. we found eight cdss  which represent the genes gumb, c, d, e, h, j, k and m, respectively. the genes gumf, g, i and l are not present in the gdi genome. as gdi is not virulent, this cluster may be related with colonization and survival. in addition, it is proposed that the viscous nature of eps helps localize and stabilize hydrolytic enzymes produced by the bacteria  <cit> . we found a putative endoglucanase protein  in the gum cluster that may degrade plant cell walls in order to facilitate the active penetration of the bacteria and thereafter the colonization. in addition, the production of hydrolytic enzymes by gdi has been observed  <cit> .

biological nitrogen fixation 
the genetics and biochemistry of bnf and nitrogen utilization by g. diazotrophicus have been previously investigated to some extent. corroborating previous studies  <cit> , we have found that the gdi structural genes for nitrogenase nifhdk are arranged in a cluster , which also contains other n <dig> fixation-related genes, such as fixabcx, modabc and nifab. other related genes, ntrx, ntry and ntrc  are localized elsewhere in the chromosome in a  <dig>  kb cluster. there are three copies of nifu homologous genes, one localized in the nif cluster , and the other two scattered on the gdi chromosome . no drat or drag homologs were found in gdi, confirming that nitrogenase activity is not regulated at the post-translational level. it has been suggested that post-translational modulation in g. diazotrophicus might be mediated by a fesii shethna protein  <cit> , but no such cds was identified. however, many other fesii protein genes are present, and they possible candidates for this role. the apparent absence of nifl as a nifa activity modulator in response to the cell o <dig> status in gdi  <cit>  is in agreement with the lack of a nifl homolog on the genome. the nifa protein appears to be inherently sensitive to o <dig>  in g. diazotrophicus, the main route for assimilation of ammonia is believed to occur through the glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase pathway   <cit> . however, the genome analysis suggests the existence of alternative routes, where the putative enzymes nad-synthase , aminomethyltransferase , histidine ammonia-lyase  and d-amino acid dehydrogenase  would incorporate ammonia into different compounds. the enzymatic activity of gs is known to be regulated by an adenylyltransferase enzyme, which is probably encoded by glne . the glutamate dehydrogenase gene was not found in gdi, although its activity was demonstrated for g. diazotrophicus strain pal <dig>  <cit> .

signaling and quorum sensing
the gdi genome contains  <dig> ggdef family genes that are involved in the synthesis of the second messenger cyclic di-gmp, which has been shown to regulate cellulose synthesis and other processes such as transitions between sessile and planktonic lifestyle and pathogenesis  <cit> . there are three cytoplasmic and  <dig> membrane-bound histidine kinase signaling proteins, the majority of which form two-component signaling systems with a neighboring response regulator gene. among these histidine kinases are homologs of the kdpd , envz , chvg , ntry , ntrb  and phob  genes. in addition, there are two adjacent hybrid histidine kinase/response regulator genes that are organized in an apparent operon  that contains several chemotaxis genes and a proteolytic system encoded by hsluv that is absent in gox. chemotaxis enables microorganisms to move towards beneficial or away from harmful substances in their environments by means of flagellar motility. the g. diazotrophicus genome contains nine methyl-accepting proteins , the majority of which have close homologs in rhizobia, but not in the phylogenetically related non-endophyte gox, which has only three mcp genes  <cit> . quorum sensing has been shown to be important in traits such as virulence, biofilm formation and swarming motility in many bacteria  <cit> . in the azoarcus sp bh <dig> genome, quorum sensing genes were not found, and it was suggested that this was compatible with a non-pathogenic interaction of azoarcus sp bh <dig> with the host plant  <cit> . nevertheless, gdi, which inhabits a niche similar to azoarcus sp bh <dig>  has three quorum sensing genes: one luxi autoinducer synthase gene  and two luxr-type transcriptional regulator genes . quorum sensing genes are also present in several rhizobial genomes, and they play roles in nodulation and nitrogen fixation  <cit> .

plant growth-promoting  traits
there are several indications that gdi promotes plant growth by more than a few independent mechanisms besides nitrogen fixation, including synthesis of phytohormones and increased uptake of nutrients  <cit> . recent work has shown that mutations in two genes involved in cytochrome c biogenesis reduced auxin levels to 10% of the wild-type strain  <cit> , suggesting their involvement in indole acetic acid  production, and indicating that gdi has at least two independent pathways for auxin biosynthesis. in addition, characterization of the iaa biosynthetic route in gdi has shown that auxin is mostly synthesized by the indole-3-pyruvic acid  pathway  <cit> . although no cds encoding an indole 3-pyruvate carboxylase was found in gdi genome, we cannot rule out that the biochemical activity could be executed by one of the many putative decarboxylases identified in the genome. the presence of genes encoding enzymes such as aromatic-l-amino-acid decarboxylase , amine oxidase  and aldehyde dehydrogenases  suggests that the bacteria might synthesize iaa via the trypamide pathway . also, the presence of two genes coding for putative nitrilases  suggests that iaa might be produced by the indole-3-acetonitrile pathway . in addition to phytohormone production, some rhizosphere-associated bacteria can stimulate plant growth by secreting a mixture of plant volatiles, mainly 3-hydroxy-2-butanone  and  <dig> -butanediol  <cit> . although the role of gdi in pgp has been studied, no attention has been paid to the production of volatiles. we found gdi is likely to be capable to synthesize acetoin once the genome sequence encodes two enzymes of the pathway; acetolactate synthase  and acetoin diacetyl reductase . in addition, although an acetolactate decarboxylase has not been identified, 2-acetolactate can be converted to diacetyl spontaneously in the presence of oxygen . it has been shown for azospirillum brasilense that the production and secretion of polyamines promote plant growth  <cit> . the presence of genes coding for enzymes for the synthesis  and secretion  of spermidine in the g diazotrophicus pal <dig> genome sequence suggests that this polyamine may also contribute to pgp. g. diazotrophicus has been shown to synthesize the gibberellins ga <dig> and ga <dig>  <cit> . although the gibberellin biosynthesis machinery in bacteria is largely unknown, recent studies have suggested likely biosynthetic mechanisms in bradyrhizobium japonicum  <cit> . the gdi genome contains genes for the synthesis of the diterpenoid precursor isopentenyl diphosphate through the non-mevalonate pathway. condensation reactions of this precursor to form geranylgeranyl diphosphate may be performed by the geranyltranstransferase ispa . however, homologs of the genes responsible for the cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate in b. japonicum  are apparently absent in the gdi genome and therefore the mechanism of cyclization of geranylgeranyl diphosphate to ent-kaurene remains unknown. however, a putative squalene cyclase  could fulfill such function, since a study with recombinant squalene cyclase has shown some cyclization of geranylgeraniol by this enzyme  <cit> . oxidation steps of ent-kaurene, necessary to produce ga <dig> and ga <dig>  may be catalyzed by two cytochromes p <dig> , homologs of which are absent in other acetobacteraceae genomes, thus suggesting a likely specific role in g. diazotrophicus. it has been reported that the capacity of g. diazotrophicus to antagonize diverse plant pathogens such as fungi, and bacteria contributes to increasing its ability to survive under environmental stress and leads to an improvement in plant fitness which may have important consequences for agricultural productivity  <cit> . its genome sequence encodes a large repertoire of genes whose products oppose attack from competing microbes, such as drug efflux systems, and acriflavin and fusaric acid resistance proteins. on the other hand, gdi may also produce a broad variety of proteins such as lytic enzymes and phospholipases and antibiotic biosynthetic pathways that could be toxic to other organisms. the secretion of a lysozyme-like bacteriocin by g. diazotrophicus, for instance, inhibits xanthomonas albilineans growth  <cit> . indeed, gdi encodes a putative lysozyme-like bacteriocin .

sugar metabolism and energy generation
sucrose is the common carbon source used for isolation of gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus from sugarcane and other plants in the semi-solid lgip medium  <cit> . however, sucrose is not directly metabolized by the bacteria. experimental evidence has shown that there is a constitutively expressed levansucrase , secreted to the periplasm via a specific signal peptide-dependent pathway, that converts sucrose to beta- <dig>  -oligofructans and levan  <cit> . in addition, a fructose-releasing exo-levanase  probably controlled by an antitermination inducer system converts polyfructans into fructose  <cit> . a type ii secretion operon  is required for the transport o f lsda across the outer membrane  <cit> . the transport of lsdb to the periplasm involves the cleavage of the n-terminal peptide signal, and it is induced during growth of the bacteria with low fructose levels but repressed by glucose  <cit> .

in g. diazotrophicus oxidation of glucose to gluconate in the periplasmic space is the first step in glucose metabolism by gdi  <cit> . gluconate may be synthesized by the product of three cds encoding membrane-bound quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenases  in accordance with the observed high activity of pqq-gdh detected in glucose-containing batch culture of gdi strain pal <dig> grown mainly under biological nitrogen fixation and/or c-limitation conditions  <cit> . a nad-gdh  also participates in the glucose oxidation  when glucose is in excess  <cit> . further periplasmic oxidation of gluconate to 2-ketogluconic acid occurs by a putative three-subunit flavin-dependent gluconate-2-dehydrogenase . gluconate dehydrogenases  activities have been demonstrated in gdi strain pal <dig> grown in presence of gluconate with 2-ketogluconate the major compound accumulated . the production of 5-ketogluconate and  <dig>  di-ketogluconate are probably mediated by a glucose/methanol/choline oxidoreductase  and a putative alcohol dehydrogenase cytochrome c/gluconate 2-dehydrogenase acceptor . high activities of 2-ketogluconate reductase  have been detected in a gdi pal <dig> strain grown with gluconate  <cit> .

cds for transport  and phosphorylation  proteins indicate that gluconate can also be directly driven into the pentose phosphate route , supporting the experimental data  <cit> . the presence of a kinase , a 2-ketogluconate reductase  and a 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase-nad  corroborates with the experimental data which shows that the ppp is the main c-metabolism route in gdi following the oxidation of glucose to gluconate  <cit> .

different from gox, cdss encoding a complete respiratory chain complex i  are present in the gdi genome  <cit> . the gdi genome contains cds that encode l-sorbosone dehydrogenases , membrane-bound small and large subunits  and the cytochrome c subunit  of aldehyde dehydrogenase, indicating that gdi may be able to synthesize the industrially important substances such as l-ascorbic acid  and its precursor 2-keto-l-gulonic acid  <cit> .

genome features in accessory regions
type iv secretion system
type iv secretion systems  are multi-subunit cell envelope-spanning structures, ancestrally related to bacterial conjugation machines, that transfer proteins, dna and nucleoprotein complexes across membranes  <cit> . moreover, t4sss have been described as essential pathogenicity factors and recently it has been indicated that tss <dig> can also increase host adaptability in bartonella sp.  <cit> . gdi has  <dig> complete t4ss in the chromosome which are similar to bacterial conjugation machines  of agrobacterium tumefasciens  <cit>  and ti  enterobacter incp plasmid r <dig>  <cit> . although the order of the trb genes in the operon is conserved , two genes are missing from the original trb operon . the gene trbk has been reported as non-essential but trbh has been reported as essential for conjugal transfer of agrobacterium tumor inducing plasmid ptic <dig>  <cit> . another difference is that, in agrobacterium tumefasciens and enterobacter incp plasmid r <dig>  the first gene in the operon is trai, which is an essential signal for the quorum-sensing regulation of the ti plasmid conjugation transfer  <cit> . in gdi the first gene in the operon is trag, which is essential for dna transfer in bacterial conjugation. this gene is thought to mediate interactions between the dna-processing  and the mating pair-formation  systems  <cit> . t4ss have been found in many different organisms  <cit> , from pathogenic to mutualistic endosymbiont organisms . all four complete t4ss operons in the gdi chromosome were found in accessory regions , suggesting that the bacteria acquired the ability to translocate macromolecules across the cell envelope to the plant. the four copies of the t4ss operon diverge by the presence of a variable region between the trag and the trbb genes that include transcriptional regulators mucr and arac, a dna-binding protein hu-beta, an aldo/keto reductase and hypothetical proteins. these genes might confer specific functions to each t4ss copy.

flagella and pili
in many organisms, flagella are involved in motility, adherence, biofilm formation and host colonization  <cit> . gdi has a large accessory region  with at least  <dig> genes predicted to encode functions related to motility. this observation is in accordance with the presence of peritrichous flagella on the gdi cell surface. next to the motility cluster there is a putative tad locus  which probably encodes the machinery for the synthesis of flp  pili, which form a subfamily in the type ivb pilus family. in actinobacillus, haemophilus, pasteurella, pseudomonas, yersinia and caulobacter. flp pili are essential for biofilm formation, colonization and pathogenesis  <cit> . additionally, several pseudopilins  were identified as part of a type ii secretion system. recently, it has been shown that flagella-less mutant of gdi was non-motile and displayed reduced capacity to form biofilm  <cit> . these findings suggest that these genes were acquired by hgt and play an important role in the interaction with the plant.

CONCLUSIONS
despite the potential impact of endophytes on the environment and on crop production, our current knowledge of their biology is limited. analysis of the g. diazotrophicus pal <dig> complete genome sequence provides important insights into the endophytic relationship, and suggests many interesting candidate genes for post-genomic experiments.

the genome reveals an unexpectedly high number of mobile elements for an endophytic bacterium; it is in fact the endophyte with the highest frequency of mobile genes per mb of genome. the high number of mobile elements seems to be associated with a high number of hgt events. the analysis of hgt shows that most of the genes are more similar to genes from the order rhizobiales , suggesting that a likely previous niche was located in the rhizosphere. thus, a recent evolutionary bottleneck and consequent relaxation of selection, due to a possible change of niche, is probably the hypothesis that could best explain the high number of hgt  <cit> .

in addition, to change niche from rhizosphere to endophytic, the bacteria should have features that would allow it to penetrate the plant. the putative gum-like cluster containing an endoglucanase could be important in this regard. moreover, the limited similarity with the gum-like cluster from x. campestris and the absence of some genes found in x. campestris may mean that the cluster adapted to a non-virulence profile. however, the ability to penetrate the plant is not enough to transform it into an endophyte; the bacteria must evolve together with the plant to create a more depended relationship. the genome has many features to enhance plant fitness such as bnf, phytohormones and biocontrol genes, and all of them lie in the core of the genome or have a very low "alien score". we propose that these features were important to create a dependent relationship, and may have helped gdi to spread out and occupy this niche. in contrast, many features that may be related to bacteria-plant interaction are found in genome islands, including type iv secretion systems, flagella, pili, chemotaxis, biofilm, capsular polysaccharide and some transport proteins. the overall result suggests that it is more likely that gdi acquired many features that are important for an endophytic lifestyle. thus, experimental analyses of genes from genome islands may reveal an important source of gene candidates that will enhance our understanding of bacteria-plant relationship.

finally, comparison of genome sequences of gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus and azoarcus sp. bh <dig> shows that these endophytic diazotrophic bacteria adopted very different strategies to colonize plants. a limited number of genomic features, such as the large number of tonb receptors, the gum-like and nif clusters, and osmotolerance mechanisms are common to both endophytic diazotrophic bacteria. on the other hand, gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus has a larger number of transport systems, and it is capable of growing on a wide variety of carbon sources, while azoarcus sp. bh <dig> has rather complex signaling mechanisms to communicate with its plant host.
