BACKGROUND
a mutation in a soybean flower color gene  encoding a flavanone 3-hydroxylase  was characterized as a novel transposon insertion, tgm-express <dig>  of the cacta superfamily, that carried multiple captured host gene fragments  <cit> . the most visible effect of the wp mutation is production of pink rather than purple flowers and lighter color in the seed coats . it has also been associated with lower oil and higher seed protein content than the purple flowered wp isoline  <cit> .

the tgm-express <dig> element, like the pack-mules  of maize, rice and arabidopsis, retroelements in rice and the helitrons of maize contains several host gene fragments. it carries intronic and exonic regions of five genes: unknown protein , cell division cycle  <dig> , fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase/fructose-2-6-biphosphatase , malate dehydrogenase  and cysteine synthase   <cit> . little is known about how any of those transposons or retroelements acquired the gene pieces but there is some evidence that they are transcribed creating chimeric cdnas that exist in est  collections  <cit> . of  <dig> pack-mules identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> of rice via computer searches, 5% were transcribed based on exact matches to full-length cdnas  <cit> . most of the transcripts  were initiated from promoters at the tirs  or within the element while 9% of the transcripts initiated outside the element. three chimeric transcripts were seen in an rna blot probed with both a sh <dig> and a helitron insertion fragment probes  <cit> . a single  <dig>  bp chimeric transcript spanning the entire helitron including several gene fragments contained within the element has also been described  <cit> . the promoter was predicted to reside upstream of the helitron insertion site.

we present here an array of  <dig> distinct alternatively spliced chimeric transcripts obtained via rt-pcr that were derived from the soybean wp mutant allele in which the second intron of the f3h <dig> gene is interrupted by the  <dig>  kb transposon containing five captured host gene-fragments. the chimeric transcripts analyzed were more abundant in seed coats than in cotyledons and ranged in size from  <dig>  bp to a correctly processed one of  <dig>  bp that was identical to the transcript derived from the wild type wp allele. all transcripts isolated initiated at the f3h <dig> gene  promoter that is strongly expressed in seed coats.

alternative splicing is a common regulatory mechanism in higher eukaryotes and the mechanisms governing it have been studied extensively in mammalian systems but sparingly in plants  <cit> . in general, the splicing pattern of a multiexon pre-mrna can be altered in many ways. exons that are always spliced and included in the mature mrna are known as constitutive exons. however, mechanistic decisions of the splicing components can result in exons that are included at times but excluded at others times from the mature mrna. these are referred to as cassette exons. there are also occurrences of 5' and 3' alternative splice sites altering the length of some exons. in addition, the failure to remove an intron, referred to as intron retention, is also found. genes whose pre-mrnas have multiple locations of alternative splicing produce a family of related proteins with different allosteric regulation, protein localization, or enzymatic activity  <cit> .

we show that the exon/intron regions of gene fragments carried by the tgm-express <dig> of the wp allele are alternatively spliced and assembled with the constitutive exons of the f3h <dig> gene to generate an array of chimeric transcripts encoding a variety of open reading frames . analysis of the derived amino acid sequence from the  <dig> distinct wp chimeric cdnas predicted putative chimeric orfs varying in length and frame locations.

the splicing machinery at times eliminates all extraneous  exons and introns of the tgm-express <dig> element to generate a full length transcript identical to that of the wild type gene and thus likely functional. the number of f3h molecules may be extensive enough to allow the synthesis of sufficient anthocyanin pigment that could account for the pink flower and the lighter seed coat phenotypes in the wp lines . on the other hand, the more complex chimeric transcripts containing cassette exons  from the captured gene fragments in the transposon may upon translation generate products that could interfere with function of the wild type host-gene counterparts leading to secondary phenotypes. whether any of the novel exon combinations derived from alternative splicing of the mobile exons of the tgm-express <dig> element create new phenotypes is unknown. however, there is growing evidence from both plant  <cit>  and animal  <cit>  systems that repeat sequences derived from mobile elements play a significant role in generation and evolution of novel genes and exons. the wp locus in soybean is a unique example of an insertional mutation in the act of de novo generation of fused, multiple chimeric exons through inclusion or exclusion of cassette exons carried by the element into the affected gene.

RESULTS
complex aberrant expression of the flower color mutant gene wp
we discovered that a pink flower locus  of soybean encoded a flavanone 3- hydroxylase gene  by differential screening of a cdna soybean microarray using rnas from mutant pink  and standard purple  flower isolines  <cit> . we also showed that the tgm-express <dig> transposon insertion impaired expression of the mutated gene and that the f3h <dig> gene was strongly expressed in the seed coats but not in cotyledons  <cit> .

analysis of the wp allele expression by rt-pcr with a pair of f3h <dig> outermost 5' and 3'-primers revealed a bizarre pattern of amplification resulting in a variety of cdna sizes from both seed coat and cotyledon rnas . the broad bright band of pcr product obtained with the seed coat samples  represents multiple size bands. shorter exposure photograph of that same gel revealed at least  <dig> distinct bands . the wp transcriptional activity between the two tissues, cotyledons and seed coats, could be deduced from the difference in the intensity of the pcr products obtained from the two wp rna sets . even though no hybridization to a f3h probe was apparent by rna blots with cotyledon rnas of either genotype   <cit> , rt-pcr showed the existence of  <dig>  kb transcripts representing the mature f3h <dig> gene  and the aberrant larger transcripts from mutant line rnas .

cloning the larger sized rt-pcr cdnas from plants homozygous for the wp allele resulted in a surprising array of alternatively spliced transcripts. sequence analysis of the multiple size cdnas cloned from both seed coat and cotyledons revealed multiple transcripts derived from the wp allele containing the wild type gene  exons  plus varying portions of exonic and intronic regions of the gene fragments captured by the tgm-express <dig> element that interrupts intron  <dig> in the wp allele .

likewise, figure 3c shows six cdna clones obtained via rt-pcr from cotyledon rnas. as in the case of the seed coat derived cdna clones, the larger cotyledon cdna clones  contained some intron fragments besides the three f3h exons and cassette exons from the tgm-express <dig> element. the smaller clones  contained only exons, the three f3h exons and the five cassette exons correctly spliced. the latter two clones diverged only by  <dig> bp mostly due to two splicing errors in wp-6c deleting  <dig> bp at the beginning of exon  <dig> and  <dig> bp at the cdc2/fpk exons junction . of the six cotyledon cdnas cloned, only one  was identical to one  of the seed coat cdna clones. sequence data from these clones have been deposited with the embl/genbank data libraries under accession numbers: ef <dig> , ef <dig> , ef <dig> , ef <dig> , ef <dig> , and ef <dig> .

overall, we isolated  <dig> different transcripts synthesized from the wp allele. these are a good representation of the chimeric transcripts generated by the spliceosome machinery in the tissues examined. we conclude that the most abundant transcripts shown by the discrete bands in figure 2a  have been cloned based on their size. the four most abundant bands are between  <dig> and  <dig> kb in size as are  <dig> of the  <dig> different cloned cdnas. our results also demonstrated that alternative splicing at the wp allele occurs in two tissues, one  in which the f3h promoter is highly expressed and another  in which it is not.

open reading frames of chimeric, multi-exon wp transcripts
the amino acid sequences derived from the cdna sequences of seed coat and cotyledon wp-cdna clones shown in figure 3b and 3c, varied significantly from clone to clone and consequently the putative open reading frames  of these chimeric transcripts. a search for orfs consisting of more than  <dig> amino acids  found that many were chimeric . of interest were two putative chimeric orfs present in several of the wp-cdnas. one was composed of approximately  <dig> bp  of the up exon fragment and  <dig> bp  of the cdc <dig> exon fragment. it was present in seed coat transcripts wp-25s, -22s, -28s, -9s, -12s, -4s, and cotyledon transcripts wp-9c, -8c, -2c, -13c, -12c, -6c, always in a  frame. in half the clones this orf appears as just described  . in the other half the orf is part of a larger chimeric orf containing also the f3h <dig> exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> sequences  . a second chimeric orf predicted for five of the wp-cdnas  consisted of approximately  <dig> bp  of fpk/m intronic fragment and  <dig> bp  of fpk exonic region, always in one of the three  frames . a related chimeric orf containing fpk exonic sequence of approximately 231/ <dig> bp  appears in seed coat wp-12s clone and cotyledon wp-13c and wp-6c, all three in a  frame .

the products of these chimeric orfs may not serve enzymatic functions per se but if translated, they could potentially affect the function of wild type proteins synthesized from the intact host genes . in addition to the chimeric orfs, we also found a cdna that reconstituted the f3h <dig>  the seed coat wp-15s cdna clone in the  frame contained an orf of  <dig> amino acids identical to the orf derived from the functional allele f3h <dig> of the purple flower isoline  . the product of this f3h1orf has the full potential to be translated into a functional f3h enzyme.

expression of host genes with homology to the tgm-express <dig> captured gene fragments
to analyze the expression of the host genes related to the exons captured by the tgm-express <dig> element, we amplified the cassette exons from the seed coat derived wp- <dig> cdna clone  to generate a chimeric radiolabeled probe that would hybridized to all rnas with homology to the probe's exon fragments. these include those transcripts derived from the related host genes as well as the chimeric transcripts expressed from the wp mutant allele. this probe contained sequence fragments with similarity to an unknown protein , cell division cycle  <dig> , fructose-6-phosphate 2-kinase/fructose-2-6-biphosphatase , malate dehydrogenase  and cysteine synthase  genes.

in addition, the hybridizing rnas shown in figure  <dig> are large transcripts of size similar to those recovered by rt-pcr suggesting that most likely there are no internal transcription initiation sites within the tgm-express <dig> element to generate truncated smaller transcripts.

discussion
plant transposable elements have long been known to cause changes in gene expression as a result of insertion or deletion in coding regions and gene promoters and their effect on rna processing  <cit> . however, more than  <dig> years of research on tracking the movements of individual transposable elements at the molecular level has revealed only a few examples that these elements were capable of transposing non-element associated coding regions from the host genome. a part of a host gene was carried by a mutator  related element  <cit>  and another by the bs <dig> retroviral element  <cit> . more recently, with the availability of entire genome sequences for rice and arabidopsis, many mu-like elements associated with fragments of host cellular genes have been found in those two plant species  <cit> . bioinformatics analysis of the rice genome uncovered  <dig> intact retrogenes of which  <dig> were predicted to have chimeral protein coding sequences and several of these were confirmed by expression data  <cit> . a novel family of maize transposons, the helitrons, has been found recently to be embedded with portions of cellular gene fragments  <cit> . the tgm-express <dig>  a member of the cacta family, was shown to carry four genic fragments  <cit> . an additional exonic region, up, was identified upon analysis of the rt-pcr cdna sequences obtained in the present study. more significantly, we show also that the wp allele carrying the tgm-express <dig> spawns an array of chimeric transcripts resulting from alternative splicing events at this locus, some of which lead to novel open reading frames.

if one were to envision an evolutionary advantageous mechanism for the novo generation of mutations, it likely would be one that would alter the splicing of a gene's constitutive exons to produce novel proteins without the complete loss of the wild-type protein. the wp pink flower mutation of soybean that we describe offers an example of how a transposon insertion in the intron of the wild-type gene  could generate an array of alternatively spliced transcripts with potential to be translated into novel proteins without totally losing the ability to synthesize the wild-type transcript and encoded protein. the transposon insertion, tgm-express <dig>  responsible for this mutation carries five host gene fragments, up, cdc <dig>  fpk, m and cs, which we show are exons that are alternatively spliced with f3h <dig> exons. sequence analysis of multiple rt-pcr derived cdnas from two different tissues, the seed coat and the cotyledon, revealed the processing of at least  <dig> distinct putative transcripts,  <dig> of which contained besides the f3h exons  varying numbers of cassette exons with or without small host gene-fragment intronic portions. in addition, transcripts with only the constitutive f3h exons were also synthesized from the wp mutant allele. although observations of element removal from maize exons  <cit>  and introns  <cit>  has previously been observed, the splicing of the very large wp intron of  <dig>  kb  is an unusual event. plant introns are generally short and splicing of extremely large introns is rare  <cit> .

in alternative splicing processes in other eukaryotic systems, splicing of the pre-messenger rna required five ribonucleoproteins and numerous accessory proteins to form four complexes  to join two adjacent exons with the release of an intervening sequence  <cit> . it is remarkable to see the variety of processed transcripts that were created from the wp mutant allele leading to the precise splicing of the f3h and the cassette exons from within the tgm-express <dig> element . of greater interest also is the proper processing of the three cdc <dig> and two fpk exons in some of the transcripts that results in fusion of unrelated exons.

analysis of the derived amino acid sequence from the  <dig> distinct wp chimeric cdna sequences predicted putative chimeric open reading frames  varying in location and length within the cdnas . alternative splicing of the cassette exons within tgm-express <dig> creates premature termination codons in many of the transcripts which could lead to their being targets for nonsense-mediated mrna decay, the surveillance mechanism that degrades selectively nonsense mrnas  <cit> . however the larger 5'-end chimeric orfs  may have a higher chance to be translated . this orf is  <dig> aa,  <dig> aa longer than the one like the f3h wild type orf of  <dig> aa .

the correctly processed transcript, represented by the isolated wp-15s clone , would allow the synthesis of functional f3h protein which could explain the existence of residual anthocyanin pigment in the pink flowers and the lighter colored seed coats in plants with wpwp genotype . f3h function is a required step in the synthesis of all three branches of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidins . the results presented here demonstrate that wp is not a null mutation and that correctly spliced f3h <dig> transcripts are synthesized in sufficient amounts to allow the synthesis of anthocyanin pigment coloring the pink flowers  and seed coats of plants with the i, t, wp  and i, t, wp,  genotypes. the fact that wp is not a null mutation suggests that the residual anthocyanins being synthesized in the wp flowers are most likely the same as in the wp purple flowered isolines. the only difference between the colors of the two phenotypes may be the amount of pigment being synthesized.

we cloned two similar f3h genomic sequences  and found that the f3h <dig> gene is not expressed in the tissues discussed here  <cit> . therefore, the residual flower and seed coat color- phenotypes displayed by wp allele  are not the result of the expression of other f3h family member genes elsewhere in the genome.

except for the wild-type like orf in the wp- <dig> cdna clone with the three correctly spliced exons , that reconstitute f3h, most other orfs of more than  <dig> amino acids were chimeric. the more extensive ones were composed of the two first exons of f3h and varying portions of up and cdc <dig> . in addition, two other chimeric orfs encoding  <dig> and  <dig> amino acids respectively were created in several of the cdna clones analyzed. the first contains portions of up and cdc <dig> sequences in  frames while the second has fpk and fpk/m intron-derived sequences in  frames . since both the host genes and the wp chimeric transcripts appear to be weakly expressed in the tissues examined , any polypeptide fragments translated from the putative orfs, might interfere with the assembly and function of their active host protein counterparts. thus, the cdc <dig> and fpk polypeptide pieces translated from the wp mutant allele may have potential to interfere with the functional enzymes translated from intact cdc <dig> or fpk host genes. intriguingly, the second phenotype manifested in the wp mutant plants is seeds with lower oil and higher protein content than the wp plants  <cit> . inhibition of key metabolic enzymes such as fpk could potentially influence the direction of metabolic flux resulting in decreased fatty acid metabolism and linked increases in protein synthesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the multiplicity of transcript isoforms described here add an additional layer of complexity reinforcing the tremendous potential these gene-fragment-loaded-transposon elements such as tgm-express, pack-mules, helitrons, and retroelements can have not only in disrupting or modifying gene function but in the creation of new or modified genes leading to an increase in plant genome and possibly proteome diversity. analysis of human and other vertebrate genomes  <cit>  revealed that recently evolved exons are more likely to be alternatively spliced cassette exons originating from highly repeated dna elements including transposons, sines, lines, and alu repeats, emphasizing the importance of mobile elements in creating diversity during evolution of both animal and plant species.
