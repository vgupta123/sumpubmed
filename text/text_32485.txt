BACKGROUND
transcription is a complex process that requires a well-coordinated, multi-level regulatory machinery. two key players of this delicate clockwork are transcription factors and their cognate cis-regulatory elements . alone and in combination cres contribute to the temporal and spatial diversity of expression patterns, and thereby provide, inter alia, the necessary control mechanisms involved in physiological responses to a myriad of internal and external triggers  <cit> . in eukaryotic organisms, the initiation of transcription by rna polymerase ii requires the assembly of the core transcriptional machinery with the core promoter of the target gene, generally located from  <dig> bases upstream to  <dig> bases downstream of the transcription start site  <cit> . spatial constraints regarding the location of cres in core promoters are known to some degree  <cit> . in addition to the basal transcription factors that are common to all transcribed genes and that form the core transcriptional machinery, numerous specific transcription factors bind to a whole gamut of usually short upstream dna sequences, enhancing or repressing transcriptional activity in response to metabolic requirements, developmental stages or external stimuli. in contrast to the cres in the core promoter, our knowledge of the positional and spatial arrangement constraints affecting regulatory elements further upstream is much more limited. nonetheless, a frequency distribution approach has shown that distinct cre enrichment patterns can be observed in the promoters of different eukaryotes  <cit> . in the present study we undertook the task to search for constraints in the arrangement of cres in plant promoters, taking as a model two well-described elements – abre and ce <dig> – involved in transcriptional responses triggered by the phytohormone abscisic acid .

aba plays a pivotal role in many physiological and developmental processes in plants. it is involved, among others, in the establishment of bud and seed dormancy, regulation of growth, leaf senescence and abscission, stomatal closure, and responses to various abiotic stresses, such as cold, drought and salinity  <cit> . this high degree of versatility is achieved through stringent regulatory control of aba biosynthesis and hormonal cross-talk  <cit> . aba regulates gene expression mainly at the level of transcription  <cit> . the molecular analysis of promoters of aba-responsive genes has led to the identification of several motifs capable of conferring aba responsiveness to a minimal promoter  <cit> . one such motif is the aba-responsive element abre, which belongs to the so-called g-box family  <cit> . abre contains an acgt core, a sequence known to be recognized by plant bzip proteins  <cit> . it has been established that a single copy of abre is not sufficient for aba-mediated induction of transcription, but multiple abres or the combination of an abre with a so-called coupling element  can establish a minimal aba-responsive complex , and thereby confer aba responsiveness to a minimal promoter  <cit> . three coupling elements have been described, ce <dig>  ce <dig> and dre , but as indicated above, an abre pair can also function as an abrc, with the second abre playing the role of a coupling element  <cit> . the use of synthetic promoters has pointed to constraints on the orientation and spacing of abre and the ces  <cit> , albeit results from transient expression experiments may not fully reflect in planta distance and orientation requirements of aba-responsive genes.

in the study presented here, we followed an in-silico approach to investigate genome-wide spatial constraints, such as strand preference, gap length between motifs, and distance to the translational initiation codon, affecting the occurrence of putative cres in the genomes of arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. as a model we used two well known cres: abre and ce <dig>  our data revealed differences between the two genomes that point to evolutionary divergent patterns of aba-responsive regulatory networks.

RESULTS
screening strategy
we searched for abres and ce3s in the promoter regions of protein-coding genes from a. thaliana and o. sativa using the genomic sequences of arabidopsis  and rice  downloaded from the institute for genomic research   <cit> . due to scarce information on 5' untranslated regions  for genes in the two genomes we opted for the use of 1-kb upstream sequences of predicted or verified translational start codons  instead. beside the practical aspect, this approach also takes into account that a number of cres are located within the 5'utr  <cit> . a rice 1-kb upstream sequence database was obtained from tigr. for arabidopsis we extracted the corresponding regions from the full-genome sequence. annotated pseudogenes, transposable-element-related and rna-coding genes were discarded from both genomic data sets. the final data sets comprised upstream sequences of  <dig>  genes from arabidopsis and  <dig>  from rice . these were first used to generate randomised data sets that served in the following analyses as a background model. the background model was generated by reshuffling the individual upstream sequences while maintaining their original single-nucleotide frequencies. the reshuffling process was repeated  <dig> times to generate  <dig> different data sets of randomised 1-kb upstream sequences for arabidopsis and rice, respectively .

abres and ce3s were then located in the 1-kb upstream sequences applying a matrix-based in-silico screening procedure . element-specific frequency matrices were generated from upstream sequences known to confer aba responsiveness. the sequence logos as well as the frequency matrices for abre and ce <dig> are shown in fig.  <dig>  candidate sequences for abres or ce3s were considered as positive hits if the score, i.e. the sum of scores at each position of the matrix, was ≥ 95% of the maximally attainable score . application of this cut-off led to the identification of  <dig> putative abres and ten different ce3s . the distance to the atg was calculated for each detected abre and ce <dig> . distances between pairs were computed whenever two or more non-overlapping elements co-localised within the same 1-kb sequence .

single abre frequency in arabidopsis promoters is similar to that in randomised sequences
we first used the motif models to identify all single occurrences of abre and ce <dig> in arabidopsis and rice promoters. the significance of the results was assessed by comparing the number of occurrences of each motif in the genomic data set with the number of occurrences in the randomised data sets . the relevance of strand orientation was assessed by counting the number of matches on either strand. for comparison purposes between both species, the number of occurrences was normalized to the number of motifs per  <dig>  genes .

*significantly different from the background model at p <  <dig>  .

our analysis revealed that in both species abre shows no orientation preferences. however, we found that the number of abres per  <dig>  genes is about  <dig>  times higher in rice than in arabidopsis . interestingly the number of abres found in the randomised data sets of arabidopsis was almost identical to that in the genomic data set . in contrast, in rice there were significantly less  abres in the randomised than in the genomic data sets . thus, the relative abundance of abres was higher in rice than in arabidopsis.

in arabidopsis, the distance of abres to the translational start codon  differed only slightly from that of a random distribution while the number of elements was significantly higher only at short distances from the atg . in contrast, the number of occurrences in the intervals 351– <dig> bp and 651– <dig> bp was significantly smaller than in the randomised data sets . as expected for a suitable background model, abres in the reshuffled data sets were evenly distributed . in rice the distribution plot for abre shows marked differences between the randomised and the genomic data sets. for nearly all distance intervals, the number of abres was significantly higher in the genomic data set . surprisingly, abres in rice showed a positional preference different from that in arabidopsis. whereas in the latter abres tend to be located close to the atg, in rice they were underrepresented in that region.

ce <dig> is overrepresented in rice but almost absent in arabidopsis
the ce <dig> screen of the arabidopsis genome revealed only  <dig> matches among the  <dig>  genes analysed. this small number corresponds to  <dig> elements per  <dig>  genes, which is not significantly different from the number obtained for the corresponding randomised data sets . in rice ce <dig> was about  <dig> times more frequent than in arabidopsis  and at least five times more abundant than in the corresponding randomised sequences  . as with abre the number of ce3s found on either dna strand was almost identical.

the distribution of distances of ce3s relative to the atg is shown in figure 3b. in the genomic data set most cres are located close to the atg . the inlay panel shows the distribution of distances of ce3s found in arabidopsis, using the same scale as in rice. from this representation it becomes evident that ce3s are abundant in rice but almost absent in arabidopsis.

additional files  <dig> and  <dig> contain a list of all arabidopsis and rice genes harbouring a single abre or ce <dig> in their upstream sequences. the distances of the cres to the translation start codon  as well as their strand orientations are indicated. the tables additionally include  a description of the protein encoded by the gene's orf;  the length of the 5'utr of the gene ; and  the location of the element with respect to the 5'utr. information regarding the 5'utr is available for around  <dig> percent of all genes. nevertheless, our analysis showed that in arabidopsis and rice cres are in most cases located upstream of the 5'utr.

abre-abre pairs are overrepresented in arabidopsis and rice
it has been shown in arabidopsis, rice, barley and other plant species that aba responsiveness relies on the interaction of two cres in the promoter region  <cit> . abre has been shown to form functional aba-responsive complexes together with ce <dig>  <cit> , but also a pair of abres can form such a complex  <cit> . therefore, we investigated the occurrence of all possible pairs  in both plant species. in doing so, we considered all possible strand orientations, distances between pairs, and distances of pairs to the atg . in the following, the first element of a given pair is the one more distant to the atg .

the number of abre-abre pairs detected in the genomic and randomised data sets is shown in table  <dig>  for both species we found more abre-abre pairs in the genomic data sets than in the randomised data sets. specific structural patterns, not detected when looking at single abres, became evident when looking at abre-abre pairs, especially in arabidopsis. the ratio between genomic and randomised data was about unity for single abres in arabidopsis, while the ratio for abre-abre pairs was about  <dig> . both these numbers were higher in rice, with single abres being  <dig>  times more abundant than in the randomised data sets, and abre-abre pairs  <dig>  times, respectively. hence, in both species the pairing process increased the relative difference between genomic and randomised data by a factor of approximately  <dig> .

results are significantly different from the background model at p <  <dig>   .

abre-abre pairs showed no strand preference in either genomic data set . however, we found that most pairs were located in relatively close proximity to the atg. the mean distance from the proximal end of the complex to the atg was similar for both species . furthermore, in both cases around half the pairs showed a maximal distance to the atg of  <dig> bp .

n.a., not applicable because of absence or low abundance.

despite the close proximity of many complexes to the atg, the cres were only rarely located within the 5'utr . in both species the gap between abre-abre pairs was typically small . the mean gap length was  <dig> bp for arabidopsis and  <dig> for rice . for more than half the pairs found in both genomes the spacing was ≤  <dig> bp. taken together, in both genomes abre-abre pairs exhibit specific structural preferences with respect to abundance, gap length and distance to the atg.

ce3-ce <dig> pairs are absent in arabidopsis but exhibit preferred orientation in rice
as indicated above, ce <dig> is almost absent in arabidopsis, and without exception the few hits obtained represented single matches, i.e. no ce3-ce <dig> pairs were found. in rice, on the other hand, the number of ce3-ce <dig> pairs observed in the genomic data set was almost  <dig> times larger than in the randomised data sets , and the complexes were located close to the atg, with a mean distance of  <dig> bp . the gap size between cres was typically small, with a mean of  <dig> bp, and more than 80% of the pairs had gap lengths ≤  <dig> bp . remarkably, and in contrast to abre-abre pairs, which do not exhibit orientation preferences, ce3-ce <dig> pairs displayed a clear preference for the cis orientation  or , rather than for the trans orientation  or  . in sum, ce3-ce <dig> pairs displayed specific structural preferences with respect to abundance, gap length, distance to the atg, and mutual orientation.

abre and ce <dig> pairs exhibit positional preferences in rice
as expected from the low abundance of ce3s in arabidopsis, abre-ce <dig> pairs were almost absent in this species. only ten abre-ce <dig> and  <dig> ce3-abre pairs were found in the complete genomic data set. because of their small number, no further analyses were performed. in contrast, in rice both pairs, abre-ce <dig> and ce3-abre, were nearly ten and five times more abundant than in the randomised data sets, respectively . interestingly, abre-ce <dig> pairs were almost three times more frequent than ce3-abre pairs, pointing to a non-arbitrary positioning of these elements. further striking differences became evident after analysing the gaps within pairs. whereas ce3-abre pairs exhibited a smooth distance distribution, with most pairs showing a gap length of  <dig> to  <dig> bp , abre-ce <dig> pairs showed a large peak at a gap length of 151– <dig> bp . despite the different distribution patterns, the mean gap lengths were similar:  <dig> bp for abre-ce <dig> and  <dig> bp for ce3-abre . from all four pairs analysed in this study, abre-ce <dig> showed the shortest mean distance to the atg , while ce3-abre showed a mean distance of  <dig> bp, which was similar to the mean distance for abre-abre pairs .

for both abre-ce <dig> and ce3-abre pairs, we did not observe a preference for cis or trans orientation . however, for both pairs the atg-proximal cre was preferably located on the minus-strand. two-thirds of ce3-abre pairs were found in the  or  orientation . similar results were obtained in the case of abre-ce <dig> pairs. the orientations   and especially   were more prevalent than the  and  orientations . summarising, the analysis of ce3-abre and abre-ce <dig> pairs in rice revealed inherent functional constraints affecting their position and orientation. interestingly, abres were not only more frequent in the distal position, but they were also subject to specific constraints with respect to their abundance, gap length, distance between the elements and the atg, and orientation of the proximal cre relative to the atg.

biological relevance
to better understand the biological implications of our observations, the putative aba-responsive genes identified in our screen were compared with genes regulated by aba, and which had been identified in the course of expression profiling experiments  <cit> . the results presented in table  <dig> show the number of arabidopsis genes predicted by our screening approach and those that were experimentally verified. the number of aba-responsive genes confirmed experimentally increased from  <dig> to  <dig> percent when abre-abre pairs rather than single abres were considered. thus the pairing process results not only in a better distinction between the genomic data set and the background model , but also allows a more accurate identification of functional abrcs in plant genomes.

in rice, the limited number of publicly available expression profiling experiments revealed only  <dig> aba-responsive genes   <cit> . despite the small number of aba-responsive genes confirmed experimentally, the overlap between genes predicted by our computational screening and those experimentally verified also increased when at least one cre pair, rather than a single cre, had been identified in the upstream region . however, the significance of these findings will only be confirmed once more expression data become available.

among the rice genes identified in our study as harbouring at least one cre pair , there are some that are already being employed experimentally as aba-responsive markers, such as: two protein phosphatase 2c genes ; the hva <dig> gene ; the rab 16d gene ; and genes encoding lea  proteins  <cit> .

strikingly, the largest number of cre pairs  was found in the promoter region of a putative nac transcription factor gene . using the recently established plant transcription factor database   <cit>  we were able to identify putative loc_os01g <dig> orthologous genes in both arabidopsis  and populus trichocarpa . the ataf <dig> promoter harbours two abres, and a single abre is present in the upstream region of the p. trichocarpa gene. ataf <dig> has been shown to function as a transcription factor in an aba-dependent abiotic stress response pathway  <cit> . our findings support an evolutionary conservation of this regulatory network in monocots and dicots, and stress the importance of nac transcription factors in aba-dependent signalling pathways beyond their role as aba-independent trans-activators  <cit> .

discussion
regulation of gene expression is one of the chief mechanisms of phytohormone action. the identification of genes responsive to external or internal stimuli often relies on experimental data derived from mutant or knockout plants, and more recently also expression profiling experiments  <cit> . with the availability of the fully sequenced arabidopsis and rice genomes  <cit> , computational methods can additionally be applied to determine cres in promoter regions of genes expressed differentially upon the action of diverse stimuli, but also to make genome-wide predictions about the expression patterns of genes not yet characterised in detail. in this study we conducted a genome-wide search for cres known to be involved in aba-dependent regulation of gene expression, in arabidopsis and rice. we focussed on abre and ce <dig> as model cres, and uncovered a number of noteworthy features regarding dna strand preferences, distances, and orientation patterns inherent to pairs formed by these cres. these findings will help in genome-wide scans for genes sharing common phytohormone-responsive mechanisms.

the predominantly short gap distances within cre pairs found in our study suggest that there is a high potential for physical interaction between the transcription factors binding to the cres involved, as would be expected for abrcs affecting rna polymerase ii activity.

one of the most remarkable findings of our study was the virtual absence of ce <dig> in upstream sequences of arabidopsis thaliana. this finding might explain why despite numerous reports of ce <dig> sequences in a number of monocot plant species   <cit>  so far no functional ce <dig> has been reported in arabidopsis or other dicots. to our knowledge, only suzuki and colleagues have reported ce3-like sequences in association with abre in arabidopsis upstream sequences, albeit the association was not statistically significant  <cit> . the marked prevalence of abre-abre pairs in arabidopsis is in agreement with other reports indicating that they are probably the most common receptor-binding complexes in this species  <cit> . we have further indications that dre-abre and myb-abre pairs are significantly over-represented in upstream sequences of arabidopsis  <cit> .

considering the importance of ces in specifying aba responsiveness in combination with abre  <cit> , it is tempting to hypothesise that there has been a gain or a loss and subsequent diversification of ce <dig> usage along the evolutionary path. the fact that ce <dig> is virtually absent in arabidopsis points to an evolutionary deep branching point. analysis of upstream sequences from other plant species will be needed to reveal how the most recent common ancestor of dicots and monocots looked like and whether the virtual absence of ce <dig> is common among dicots.

using a combined approach to define abre-ce <dig> pairs in rice  and by constraining the distance between elements to maximally  <dig> bp, ross and shen recognized – as we do in our study – that ce <dig> elements show a preference for the minus strand  <cit> . from these observations, we infer that the orientation bias may reflect the evolutionary history of these elements, since in rice these elements are functional in either orientation  <cit> . however, differences in orientation may perhaps lead to differential transcription efficiencies.

by investigating all kinds of arrangements between pairs of abres and ce3s, taking all distances between cres into account without any restrictions, and by using a more complex definition of ce <dig>  our screening approach complements and enhances the computational approach applied by ross and shen. one of our findings was that distal abres were three times more frequent than proximal abres in abre-ce <dig> pairs . concurrently there was a clear bias towards ce <dig> elements in the reverse orientation, thus forming  or  pairs in combination with abre, or towards ce3s on the same strand in the case of ce3-ce <dig> pairs. since only few studies have dealt with the biological relevance of such spatial arrangements, we would like to draw the attention to these salient genomic features.

thus far the combinatorial potential of cres has been mostly understood in terms of motif co-occurrence. however, nguyen and d'haeseleer  <cit> , working on yeast, showed to which extent nature may exploit spatial arrangement as another dimension of combinatorial power in transcriptional regulation. the precise positioning of cres within a given promoter might thus directly modulate gene expression by affecting the three-dimensional structure of the transcriptional machinery. this adds another level of complexity, applied to the fine-tuning of transcriptional regulation. features such as orientation and order of the elements in a promoter underline regulatory mechanisms which go beyond the mere presence, absence or spacing between motifs or distance to the transcriptional start site.

the results of the in-silico genome-wide analysis presented here provide additional clues about the relevance of orientation and combination of motifs in aba-responsive genes, now open for validation by targeted gene expression analyses. the fact that aba responsiveness of only few of the in-silico-predicted genes has been experimentally verified probably reflects technical limitations that hinder detailed gene expression studies, e.g. in highly specialised  cell types. a further complication stems from our incipient knowledge about the number of aba-responsive genes in different tissues and developmental stages, and the responsible cres and their structural arrangements. aba-dependent processes highly confined in space and time are technically difficult to unravel, but once we have built a robust understanding of the interplay of cres and transcription factors, we will be in a position to make accurate predictions and design appropriate experiments to confirm those predictions.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study we have used a matrix-based search algorithm to show that the aba-responsive elements abre and ce <dig> are not equally common in plant genomes of different species. abre-abre pairs form aba-responsive complexes that are functional and relevant in arabidopsis and rice. the low abundance of ce3s in arabidopsis, as opposed to its experimentally verified presence in rice, barley and maize, suggests a preferential role for ce <dig> in aba-dependent gene regulation in monocotyledonous species. in rice, the orientation preferences of ce <dig> further suggest that this element might be typical of monocots, and that its orientation bias may serve to modulate aba responsiveness of genes and their transcriptional activation potential.
