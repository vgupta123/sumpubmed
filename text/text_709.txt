BACKGROUND
carotenoids are isoprenoids which derived from the precursor molecule isopentenyl pyrophosphate and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate. all photosynthetic organisms including cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants synthesize carotenoids  <cit> . carotenoids are divided into two major groups: carotenes, which are enriched in the centers of photosystem reaction  <cit> , and xanthophylls , oxygenated carotenoids that serve various functions in photosynthetic organisms and are essential for survival of the organism  <cit> . of xanthophylls, lutein is the most abundant xanthophyll in all plant photosynthetic tissues, where it plays an important role in assembly and function of light harvesting complexes ii   <cit> . zeaxanthin is a structural isomer of lutein and a mainly component of the non-photochemical quenching  mechanism involved in protecting the organism from photo-damage  <cit> .

untangling the phylogenomics of xanthophylls biosynthesis in eukaryotic algae requires basic knowledge of their evolutionary histories. three algal phyla, the rhodophyta , glaucophyta, and viridiplantae  acquired their plastids during primary endosymbiosis starting a heterotrophic eukaryote as a host and a phototrophic cyanobacterium as an endosymbiont  <cit> . viridiplantae is comprised of two major evolutionary lineages that split in early: the chlorophyta  and the streptophyta   <cit> . subsequently, secondary endosymbiosis from green or red algae occurred, producing the extant diverse algal groups . algae comprise a paraphyletic and polyphyletic group  <cit> , as they do not include all the descendants of the last universal ancestor nor do they all descend from a common algal ancestor, although their plastids seem to have a single origin  <cit> . from an evolutionary perspective, carotenoid biosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms has become increasingly more complex and diverse  <cit> . some photosynthetic bacteria, e.g., cyanobacteria contain carotenoids with β-rings , and many of them produce various mono- or di-hydroxy xanthophyll derivatives   <cit> . in addition, pathway bifurcation occurred in some red algae and cyanobacteria , and all green algae, and higher plants at the level of lycopene cyclization, yielding α-carotene from which α-carotene-derived xanthophylls  are synthesized  <cit> . as a consequence, the origins and evolution of xanthophylls biosynthetic pathway in algae lineages is of particular interesting.

carotenoid hydroxylases  comprise an important hydroxylase protein family performing the key enzymatic steps, hydroxylation reactions for α- and β-branch xanthophylls biosynthesis in photosynthetic organisms  <cit> . in higher plants, production of α-xanthophylls from α-carotene requires one β- and one ϵ-ring hydroxylation, while synthesis of β-xanthophylls from β-carotene requires two β-ring hydroxylations. two classes of structurally unrelated enzymes catalyze these ring hydroxylations: two heme-containing cytochrome p <dig> hydroxylases  and a pair of non-heme/di-iron hydroxylases   <cit> . two β-ring hydroxylations in β-carotene are mediated by either p450-type cyp97a or bch enzyme, during which zeaxanthin is produced  <cit> . hydroxylations of β-ring and ϵ-ring in α-carotene are performed by cyp97a and cyp97c, respectively, producing lutein  <cit> . it is unknown why two different β-ring hydroxylases could have been maintained throughout the evolution. probably, their own respective activities are not entirely interchangeable  <cit> . different chy genes in higher plants are up-regulated often differentially, depending on environmental conditions or developmental stage of various tissues  <cit> . for algae, however, the research on xanthophylls biosynthesis is still in its infancy. for unicellular green algae, bch genes were investigated such as in haematococcus pluvialis and chlamydomonas reinhardtii <cit> . although lutein and its derivatives are detected in rhodophyta , cryptophyta, euglenophyta, chlorarachniophyta, and chlorophyta, enzymes involving in hydroxylation of α-carotene remains unknown  <cit> . recently, a new p <dig> protein responsible for the hydroxylation of ϵ–ring of α-carotene in arabidopsis thaliana was reported  <cit> . in addition, two genes encoding cytochrome p450-type carotenoid hydroxylases  were isolated from oryza sativa and their functions were investigated in a β-carotene producing escherichia coli strain  <cit> . moreover,  <dig> cytochrome p <dig> oxidoreductases have been discovered so far in the green alga ulva linza <cit> . therefore, it is evident that p450-type monooxygenases, in addition to non-heme hydroxylases such as bch, are involved in carotenoid hydroxylation, which identified one of the missing pieces of carotenoid biosynthetic enzyme and provided valuable clues to study chy genes in algae in the future.

recently, the genome sequences of a number of microalgae became available from the doe joint genome institute . proteins coding sequences of each filtered model of these algae genomes with representatives from very different groups such as green algae, red algae, diatoms, and haptophytes was performed to identify their chy genes. details of the completeness of genome sequences used in this study were taken from doe joint genome institute project list  . a blastp-hmmer-plus-phylogeny reconstruction approach was employed to analyze chys in focus of their distribution, structure, evolution, origins, and expression. in order to study the evolutionary histories of xanthophylls biosynthetic pathway from cyanobacteria to modern algae, candidate genes were then compared with known sequences of other organisms. based on the predicted putative chy-encoding genes, two full-length sequences of cyp97-encoding cdna  were isolated from high-astaxanthin-production green alga h. pluvialis strain flotow  <dig>  <cit> . expression profiles of different chy genes under high light stress of different wavelength were observed by means of relative quantitative real-time rt-pcr . light is considered an effective stimulus inducing the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis-related genes and the astaxanthin accumulation in economic green alga h. pluvialis <cit> . these studies provide significant insight into the origins and evolution of chy genes in photosynthetic eukaryotes and provide information for further gene cloning, functional characterization, and expression analysis of chy genes in algae. a better understanding of algal chys can help us to comprehend the roles of chys in xanthophylls biosynthetic under different adverse conditions.

RESULTS
identification, classification, and distribution of chy proteins
 <dig> algal nuclear genomes were examined for putative genes of chy proteins. a summary of algal genes putatively encoding chys is shown in table  <dig>  and the classification and distribution of candidate genes, and hypothesized xanthophylls biosynthetic pathways across organisms are given in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> putative genes encoding bch and cyp <dig>  respectively, were predicted and annotated from  <dig> complete or incomplete eukaryotic algal genomes. deduced protein sequences of genes encoding chys from the  <dig> algal genomes are shown in the additional file . among the  <dig> eukaryotic photosynthetic algae, red algae possessed a bch homolog  only. hydroxylation of β-carotene in different organisms is primarily carried out by three gene subfamilies of the non-heme/di-iron monooxygenase superfamily: bch genes of higher plants and green algae; bch genes of non-photosynthetic bacteria; and crtr genes of cyanobacteria  <cit> . green algae inhabiting freshwater  and marine environments  each possessed a bch homolog. no crtr- or bch-homolog was discovered in those algal strains from red algal secondary endosymbiotic event. previous studies, however, demonstrated a xanthophyll cycle , with violaxanthin the putative precursor of both diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin in the diatom phaeodactylum tricornutum <cit> , implying that this enzymatic reaction may therefore be catalyzed by other unrelated enzymes, such as lut-like p <dig> proteins in those algal strains from chromalveolates  <cit> . therefore, isolation and characterization of novel enzymes involved in β-xanthophylls  biosynthesis in chromalveolates are of going research.

other indicates two genes belonged to no one subfamily of cyp <dig> 

homologs of cyp97a and cyp97c genes are found in green algae, but absent in other algae, including red algae , heterokontophyta , haptophyta , cryptophyta , and stramenopiles . interestingly, two cyp97a genes were predicted in c. reinhardtii and o. lucimarinus, indicating that lineage-specific gene duplications occurred during the evolution of these algae. due to gene loss or the incompletely sequenced genome, only genes encoding cyp97b and cyp97c homologs and none gene encoding cyp97a homolog were predicted in b. natans ccmp <dig>  moreover, none gene encoding cyp97a homolog has been discovered in chlorella sp. nc64a. in this study, at least one copy of the gene encoding cyp97b was found to be widely distributed in most of algae, except for red algae, indicating that the originations of this gene is not due to secondary endosymbiosis.

domain structures of bch-type chys in algae
β-xanthophylls  are widely distributed in nature, and they are common in all photosynthetic eukaryotes, and many photosynthetic, or non-photosynthetic prokaryotes  <cit> . non-heme/di-iron β-ring carotenoid hydroxylase  has long been regarded as the only enzyme involved in zeaxanthin synthesis by hydroxylating β–carotene. genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylases have been identified and characterized from bacteria  <cit> , cyanobacteria  <cit> , algae  <cit>  and higher plants  <cit> . the bch genes of algae and higher plants encode the members of the fatty acid hydroxylase superfamily  that also includes fatty acid and carotene hydroxylases and sterol desaturases. members of this superfamily are integral membrane proteins and contain two copies of histidine-rich iron-binding motifs , needed for binding this cofactor with enzymes  <cit> .

an alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of crtrs of cyanobacteria, and bchs of red algae and green algae is displayed in figure  <dig>  there are few gaps in the alignment and a number of highly conserved regions. four transmembrane segments and four histidine-rich boxes  are distributed among the amino acid residues of bchs of green algae . it is interesting that the first transmembrane segment was absent in two bchs of green algae o. sp. rcc <dig> and o. lucimarinus, and replaced instead by another histidine-rich box in the n-terminal . three conserved histidine-rich boxes  and five transmembrane segments are generally well-conserved between red algae and cyanobacteria, indicating that red algae acquired this gene from cyanobacteria during primary endosymbiosis . however, previous studies have demonstrated that the protein sequence of the c. merolae bch  is truncated at the n-terminus by at least  <dig> amino acids relative to the sequences of all cyanobacterial crtrs, and that the activity of this encoded enzyme could not be shown when expressed in e. coli <cit> . two hxxhh boxes are widespread across the bchs of algae and crtrs of cyanobacteria, indicating that their catalytic mechanisms are highly similar in these proteins  <cit> .

origins and evolution of bchs in algae
β–carotene hydroxylation in different organisms is primarily carried out by members of three subfamilies of the non-heme/di-iron monooxygenase superfamily: bch-type enzyme of green algae and higher plants; bch-type enzyme of non-photosynthetic bacteria; and crtr-type enzyme of cyanobacteria. the former shares sequence homology with non-photosynthetic bacterial-type enzyme, and the latter  is more closely related to bacterial carotenoid ketolases  <cit> . identification of plant-like bchs in green algae and cyanobacteria-like crtrs in red algae is the key indicating complicated origination of bch in algae, for which we constructed a phylogenetic tree of crtrs of cyanobacteria and bchs of green algae, higher plants, and bacteria  .

as shown in figure  <dig>  difference between crtrs of cyanobacteria and bchs of algae, bacteria, and higher plants is very clear. genes encoding bchs from bacteria, green algae, and higher plants build a monophyletic group , and the phylogenetic relationship present here indicates that they share a common ancestor and strongly supports a non-cyanobacterial origin. in contrast to the apparently widespread retention of bch paralogs in higher plants, the gene encoding bch is a single copy in each algal genome sequences . in higher plants, duplication of the ancestral bch gene took place most probably via whole-genome or segmental genome duplication  <cit>  and the duplicates seem to have functionally diverged primarily at the gene expression level  <cit> . it is worth mentioned, however, that the gene encoding bch  of red algae forms another monophyletic group  with crtrs of cyanobacteria, suggesting that the red alga obtained this gene via the primary endosymbiotic event from cyanobacteria and retained it over the course of evolution persistently. however, the activity of this encoded enzyme was not demonstrated when expressed in e. coli <cit> . therefore, hydroxylation of β-carotene in red algae remains unclear, calling for more red-algal genomes sequences to elucidate. in this study, no bch- or crtr-type chy-encoding gene was discovered in algae of chromalveolates, except for a partial sequence of bch-type gene in the genome sequences of t. pseudonana. this result is consistent with observations from a previous study, in which only a partial sequence of bch-type gene was found in the genome sequences of t. pseudonana and no one was detected from the p. tricornutum genome  <cit> . unfortunately, the enzymatic activity of this putative carotene hydroxylases  from t. pseudonana has not yet been reported anywhere to the best knowledge of authors. therefore, the hydroxylation of β-carotene in chromalveolates remains unknown, resulting from genomes of the few organisms currently sequenced lack entire hydroxylation families and, enzymatic activity of putative carotene hydroxylases has not yet been reported at present  <cit> .

as mentioned above, it is difficult to fully understand the evolution of β-xanthophylls biosynthesis with limited available data, but some hypotheses were proposed based on the tree topology. firstly, it is presumed that crtr-type chy was originated in all algae as the result of primary endosymbiosis. in such a scenario, crtr-type chy proteins were lost in extant green algae and higher plants, and these organisms acquiring another bch from bacteria by lateral gene transfer or from the host during the primary endosymbiosis event. secondly, red algae have crtr-type chy-encoding gene, while chromalveolates do not have them due possibly to gene lost during the secondary endosymbiosis event. in addition, bch-type chys are also absent in chromalveolates, which may be resulted from the replacement of algal crtr- and bch-type chys by another unidentified novel lineage-specific chy in strains that derived from the red algal secondary endosymbiosis. previous studies of the diatom p. tricornutum <cit> , however, have demonstrated the presence of a xanthophyll cycle , with violaxanthin the putative precursor of both diadinoxanthin and fucoxanthin, implying this enzymatic reaction may therefore be catalyzed by other unrelated enzymes, such as lut-like p <dig> proteins  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that the bch genes in chromalveolates have not been under a strong pressure of natural selection like in green algae and higher plant lineages, and they may have instead evolved different ways for β-xanthophylls biosynthesis.

domain structures of cyp97s in algae
cytochrome p450s are defined by the  <dig> nm light absorption of their heme cofactors. they oxidize various arrays of metabolic intermediates and environmental compounds  <cit> , and participate in many primary, secondary, and xenobiotic metabolic reactions  <cit> . the cyp97-encoding genes are members of p450s family. these members share a common catalytic center in heme by iron coordination to the thiolate of a conserved cysteine  <cit> . despite low sequence identity at amino acid level, p450s display a common overall topology in three-dimensional folding pattern  <cit> . genes encoding members of cyp <dig> family have been isolated and functionally investigated from higher plants  <cit> . there are three cyp <dig> family members  in arabidopsis genome, of which cyp97a <dig> and cyp97c <dig> are predicted to be chloroplast-targeted  <cit> . the localization of predicted chloroplast cyp97a/c from algae and higher plants is coincident with the sub-cellular of carotenoids biosynthesis. to further reveal domain structure characteristics of cyp <dig> proteins, an alignment was constructed using selected cyp97a/b/c protein sequences from different algae  and an additional file shows this in more detail .

the alignment  reveals  <dig> domains in strongly conserved amino acid sequences from all cyp <dig> protein sequences. all conserved domains are highly similar between cyp97as and cyp97cs of green algae except for cd <dig>  , indicating that they share a common ancestor. in addition, the conserved domains in cyp97bs of distinct algae phyla are also similar, implying that this gene occurred before the formation of extant diverse algal groups. degenerate primers for cloning genes encoding cyp <dig> homologs were designed from these conserved amino acid residues. p450s catalytic motifs were found as expected in all cyp97a/b/c protein sequences including i-helix involved in oxygen binding , an err triad  responsible for locking the heme pockets into position and assuring stabilization of the conserved core structure, and cd <dig> associated with the conserved heme-binding cysteine. in addition, many amino acids were conserved in each cyp <dig> subfamily such as cd <dig>  and cd <dig>  were conserved in cyp97b subfamily only. the conserved domains associated with active sites suggest that these protein sequences are members of the p <dig> family, and that conserved domains within each cyp <dig> subfamily proteins are responsible for the specificity with respect to the β- or ϵ-ring of different carotenes.

origins and evolution of cyp97s in algae
production of α-xanthophylls  in higher plants requires four reaction steps: β- and ϵ-ring formation from lycopene by the action of β- and ϵ-cyclases ; and subsequently, hydroxylation of each ring of α-carotene by β- and ϵ-ring hydroxylases   <cit> . ample evidence shows that genes encoding cyp97a and cyp97c homologs are only present in green algae and higher plants, but not in chromalveolates, indicating that α-xanthophylls biosynthesis occurs only in green algae and higher plant lineages. in our results, this biosynthetic pathway is also absent in red algae. in contrast to a previous study postulated that synthesis of α-xanthophylls occurs in only a few lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes, namely, some red algae, all green algae, and higher plants  <cit> . an insufficient number of red algal species  may be responsible for these different conclusions. in addition, our previous and other studies have demonstrated that β-cyclases  genes are widely distributed in nature, and ϵ-cyclase  genes were identified only in green algae, higher plants, and some cyanobacteria . lyce genes seems to come from β-cyclases by gene duplication and subsequently functional divergence  <cit> , which indirectly manifests that α-xanthophylls are synthesized only in green algae and higher plants. no cyp97a and cyp97c homologs are detected in algal genome sequences from chromalveolates, and these algae cannot synthesize α-xanthophylls , which is consistent with previous studies  <cit> .

at present, no cyp <dig> protein homolog has been found in cyanobacteria, suggesting that these proteins are an ancient eukaryotic innovation. all three cyp <dig> subfamilies are represented in arabidopsis and other land plants, often in a single copy per subfamily, indicating their critical functions  <cit> . in contrast, some paralogs genes encoding cyp97a in a few green algae and cyp97b in most algae, especially in chromalveolates, indicating recent gene duplication events occurred. for deep understanding the internal phylogenetic relationships among cyp <dig> proteins from higher plants and green algae, we constructed a maximum likelihood tree using our cyp <dig> database and some other cyp97s from higher plants . cyp86a <dig> from arabidopsis thaliana was selected as outgroup because its substrates, fatty acids with chain lengths from c <dig> to c <dig> <cit>  are mostly molecules similar to carotenoids, and the cyp <dig> clade is the most closely related to the cyp <dig> clade  <cit> .

as it shows in maximum likelihood tree, cyp <dig> proteins constitute three distinct monophyletic groups: cyp97a, cyp97b, and cyp97c. two of these groups  form a sister group that are composed of proteins from green algae and higher plants. cyp97a and cyp97c sequences in chromalveolates, including heterokontophyta , haptophyta , cryptophyta , and stramenopiles  are absent in the cluster. genes encoding cyp97b homologs from all organisms form a monophyletic group . surprisingly, algal cyp97bs from chromalveolates and green algae  build another monophyletic group . this phylogenetic relationship and the lack of cyp97b homologs in c. merolae point to a “green” origin of this gene in chromalveolates, similar to the origin and evolution of hydroxypyruvate reductase  <cit> . alternatively, this gene represents early eukaryotic innovations in the plantae although lacking cyp97b homolog in c. merolae. further investigations are needed to support this hypothesis.

the topology of the phylogenetic tree shows that the cyp97b is an ancient gene emerging before the divergence of extant algae groups during evolution, and represents an ancient eukaryotic innovation. our results indicate that cyp97a is evolutionarily more closely to cyp97c than to cyp97b . therefore, we believe that the cyp97a and cyp97c genes were originated by gene duplication before the split between green algae and higher plants, and were subjected to purifying selection in a lineage-specific fashion . alternatively, these genes may have been originally present in all algae, and then they were lost gradully from red algae and chromalveolates. this scenario is similarity to that of arabidopsis whose evolution and functional divergence of two duplicate gene pairs, cyp97a3/c <dig> and bch1/ <dig> involved in carotenoid hydroxylation occurred  <cit> . additional lineage- or organism-specific gene duplications have occurred during the evolution of cyp97a in green algae , and cyp97b in most algae, except for c. reinhardtii, c. sp. nc64a, c. vulgaris, c. sp. c- <dig>  v. carteri, m. pusilla, e. huxleyi, and b. natans ccmp <dig>  duplication and subsequent functional divergence of genes have been recognized increasingly as an important mechanism of evolution  <cit> .

isolation and characterization of cyp <dig> genes from h. pluvialis
to further study genes encoding cyp <dig> homologs in green algae, three full-length cdna sequences of cyp <dig> homologs, including haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c <cit>  were isolated from commercial green alga h. pluvialis strain flotow  <dig>  briefly,  <dig> - and 984-bp cdna fragments encoding haecyp97a/b were generated by rt-pcr with degenerate primers . the haecyp97a fragment shared 77% sequence similarity with cyp97a <dig> gene of c. reinhardtii and 74% similarity with cyp97a <dig> gene of a. thaliana. the haecyp97b fragment shared 61% sequence similarity with a. thaliana cyp97b <dig> gene. the results indicate that two partial putative cyp97a/b genes were isolated from h. pluvialis. gene-specific primers were then designed to obtain full-length sequences of haecyp97a/b using race methods. information regarding the full-length sequences of haecyp97a/b/c is summarized in table  <dig>  the full-length cdna sequences of haecyp97a comprised  <dig> -bp with an open reading frame  of  <dig> -bp encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein, and it was flanked by a 159-bp of 5′-untranslated region  and a 120-bp of 3′-utr including the poly-a tail . the deduced protein had a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and a predicted isoelectric point  of  <dig> . the full-length cdna sequences of haecyp97b contained an orf of  <dig> -bp, a 2-bp 5′-utr, and a 249-bp 3′-utr, and it encoded a new putative carotenoid hydroxylase protein of  <dig> amino acid protein with a deduced molecular weight of  <dig>  kda and pi of  <dig>  . sequence analysis revealed that the cloned haecyp97c cdna was  <dig> -bp in length, and contained a  <dig> -bp orf, a 46-bp 5′-utr, and a 329-bp 3′-utr in characteristic of a poly  tail. an atg translation initiation codon was identified in the 46-bp terminal sequence , and a taa termination codon was found in the  <dig>  bp downstream of the initiation site .

abbreviations: 5’utr 5’-untranslated region, 3’utr 3’-untranslated region, cds coding sequences, mw molecular weight, pi isoelectric point, tm transmembrane regions, sl subcellular localization, bp base pair, chl chloroplast.

the chlorop and targetp servers  <cit>  were used to predict the sub-cellular location of the respective deduced proteins from isolated genes . the results indicate that cyp97a and cyp97c in h. pluvialis are probably located in the chloroplast, same as in higher plants arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . we also calculated degrees of identity and similarity between predicted amino acid sequences of each isolated cyp <dig> and corresponding cyp97s of other eukaryotes . amino acid sequences from each of the isolated cyp <dig> genes shared high similarities  with known eukaryotic proteins, indicating that the three novel cyp <dig> genes of green alga h. pluvialis flotow  <dig> has been successfully identified using rt-pcr with degenerate primers designed from conserved motifs and race methods. to our knowledge, this is the first time these three cyp <dig> gene homologs have been isolated from commercial green algae.

note: athcyp97a <dig> , athcyp97b <dig>  and athcyp97c <dig>  were downloaded from national center for biotechnology information genbank database, respectively. the data was present by the form of identity/similarity.

expression analysis of four chy genes in h. pluvialis under high light stress
studies showed that high light  effectively induces carotenoid biosynthesis-related gene expression and astaxanthin accumulation in h. pluvialis <cit> , indicating that light plays an important role in controlling green algal carotenoid biosynthesis. although the regulatory role of light in the expression of nuclear-encoded plastid-targeted proteins has been studied for decades in green algae and higher plants, elucidation of effects of light on transcriptional levels of three novel cyp <dig> genes in green algae is still in its infancy. in a previous study on diatom p. tricornutum, a blue-light library was found to be the most enriched in carotenogenesis-related ests  <cit> . for more detail in the transcriptional regulatory role of light on green algae, we studied the gene transcriptional expression profiles of bch, haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c genes in response to white and blue hl conditions.

as shown in figure  <dig>  transcriptional levels of four chy genes  were increased throughout the course of hl illumination treatments. starting from relatively low levels, bch expression level was slowly increased under blue hl treatment and reached a maximum transcriptional level at  <dig> h exposure that was  <dig> -fold higher than that of the control. it then declined sharply after  <dig> h of exposure . a similar, although less pronounced trend was observed under white hl: the highest bch transcriptional level occurred at  <dig> h of exposure, with  <dig> -fold higher compared with the control. our previous study has demonstrated that zeaxanthin concentrations under blue and white hl treatments were increased markedly and reached their highest levels at  <dig> h  and  <dig> h  of exposure  <cit> , which is listed in figure s <dig> for details . bch is the mainly enzyme catalyzing the hydroxylation of β-carotene, which produces zeaxanthin associated with the xanthophylls cycle  <cit> . the contradiction between low bch expression levels and marked increase of zeaxanthin concentration during the early stage of treatments was explained by the fact that when photoprotection is required, violaxanthin is rapidly converted via antheraxanthin to zeaxanthin by violaxanthin de-epoxidase  <cit> . the astaxanthin concentration under blue or white hl stress was higher than that of the control, reaching a maximum level at  <dig> h and  <dig> h of exposure, respectively  <cit> , which is listed in figure s <dig> for details . accumulation of astaxanthin may be responsible for the rapidly increasing levels of bch and sharply decreasing concentrations of zeaxanthin at later treatment stages. previous studies have demonstrated that bch and bkt are the main genes involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis  <cit> .

expression levels of haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c began with a slight decrease followed by a dramatic increase . strongly steady increase in transcriptional levels of haecyp97a and haecyp97b were observed during 4– <dig> h of both hl  treatments. then, they dropped sharply after  <dig> h of exposure. it is also intriguing that different conditions had various impacts on haecyp97a and haecyp97b mrna levels. for instance, transcriptional levels of haecyp97a and haecyp97b under blue hl were higher than that of under white hl during 4– <dig> h of exposure, and the contrary tendency was observed during 13– <dig> h of exposure . the maximum transcriptional levels of haecyp97c under both the blue and white hl treatments occurred at hour  <dig> and  <dig>  and transcriptional levels were  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than that of control, respectively . blue hl appeared to have stronger effects on haecyp97c transcriptional level than that of white hl . studies on mutant of higher plants showed that cyp97a <dig> and cyp97c <dig> are the enzymes primarily responsible for catalyzing hydroxylation of β- and ϵ-ring of α-carotene, respectively, producing α-branch xanthophylls , the most abundant carotenoids in light-harvesting complexes  which is key structural and functional components of light harvesting  <cit> . during early stages  of hl  treatments, lutein concentrations were lower than that of the control  <cit> , which is listed in figure s <dig> for details . this result is consistent with the decreased transcriptional levels of haecyp97a and haecyp97c observed in h. pluvialis . although haecyp97a and haecyp97c transcriptional levels increased over time, lutein concentration level remained rather stable but was lower than the control. when considering that cyp97a is also involved in hydroxylation of β-carotene into zeaxanthin, the level of haecyp97a increase is understandable  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated there was a cytochrome p <dig> involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis in h. pluvialis by the use of ellipticine  <cit> . therefore, we speculate that cyp97a may be the cytochrome p <dig> involved in astaxanthin biosynthesis in h. pluvialis. according to our results, however, it is unclear why and how the levels of haecyp97b and haecyp97c increased. the function of cyp97b is currently unknown and they  may play some additional roles  in algae under adverse conditions. an earlier study reported that cytochrome p <dig> reductase is also co-up-regulated with enzymes involved in dna repair under light/dark cycles  <cit> .

our data  reveal that mrna levels of different chy genes increase rapidly under hl exposure and varied with light wavelength. for instance, our results indicate that blue hl very significantly increased haebch and haecyp97c genes expression, and produced similar effects on haecyp97a and haecyp97b genes expression compare with white hl treatment. young et al.  <cit>  have demonstrated that different carotenoid metabolic gene isoforms typically had distinctly different expression patterns. previous study has demonstrated that zeaxanthin and astaxanthin concentrations were more efficiently enhanced for h. pluvialis under blue hl treatment than white  <cit> . therefore, we propose that haematococcus cells are more sensitive to blue induction compare with white. similar phenomena were reported red light emitting diodes  operated at a relatively low light intensity were found to be suitable for cell growth; and leds emitting short wavelength  can induce morphological changes in h. pluvialis and enhance astaxanthin accumulation  <cit> . it is well known that strong light  enhances astaxanthin accumulation, because astaxanthin is produced by h. pluvialis cells to protect cells from the strong intensity of the light  <cit> . although blue light contains more energy than red light, according to planck’s law  <cit> , in fact only energy associated to the s <dig> transition level of chlorophyll  can be used for photosynthesis  <cit> . on this bottom line, the fact that the efficiency of energy transfer from carotenoid to chl a is far lower  with respect to chl b to chl a or chl a to chl a. thus it can easily be concluded that less energy used for photosynthesis is available from blue light than from red or white light under the same light intensity. according to above conclusions, we speculate that astaxanthin accumulation for h. pluvialis depends on not only light intensity, but also light quality . therefore, we believe that the response of h. pluvialis flotow  <dig> to high light stress is a complicated process involving bch, haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c.

CONCLUSIONS
our study provided a genome-wide comparative analysis of genes encoding chys in algae, with a focus on their distribution, structure, evolution, origins, and expression. as part of this study, we provided a summary of currently known distributions of chy genes in eukaryotic photosynthetic algae, and constructed hypotheses regarding xanthophylls biosynthetic pathways. genes encoding bchs of green algae and higher plants were determined to be non-cyanobacterial origin, whereas those from red algae were derived from cyanobacteria. genes involved in β-xanthophylls biosynthetic pathway in chromalveolates remains unknown. cyp97b genes are likely an innovation of eukaryotic algae, whereas genes of cyp97a and cyp97c initiated by gene duplication events before the split of green algae and higher plants. the biosynthesis of α-xanthophylls is characteristic of green algae and higher plants. although transcriptional levels of bch, haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c were up-regulated by blue and white hl treatments, the amplitude and kinetics of mrna accumulation varied among different chy genes. compare with white light, blue light may play a more important role in controlling green algal carotenoid biosynthesis. the response of h. pluvialis flotow  <dig> to different hl stresses is a complicated course involving bch, haecyp97a, haecyp97b, and haecyp97c. the observed increase in haecyp97b transcriptional level implies that this gene may be another carotenoid biosynthetic-related gene, perhaps a novel chy gene in chromalveolates. further investigations are needed to test this hypothesis.
