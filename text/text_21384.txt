BACKGROUND
the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has two sexes, a self-fertile hermaphrodite and a male  <cit> . hermaphrodites are somatically female and undergo a transient period of spermatogenesis during the l <dig> larval stage. adult worms maintain the production of oocytes throughout the rest of their reproductive life. in the distal part of the gonad, a population of mitotically dividing cells is kept proliferative by a delta/notch type signal that originates from the distal tip cell  <cit>  . cells that migrate proximally initiate gametogenesis. the production of mature germ cells involves a switch from mitosis to meiosis and the initiation of either male or female differentiation  <cit> . to initially allow spermatogenesis to take place, the oogenesis promoting gene tra- <dig> is translationally repressed by the action of the rna binding protein gld- <dig> and the f box protein fog- <dig>  <cit> . this leads to the activation of the three fem genes  <cit>  and ultimately to the activation of the spermatogenesis promoting genes fog- <dig> and fog- <dig>  <cit>  . to switch to oogenesis, fem- <dig> is repressed post-transcriptionally by the concerted action of fbf- <dig>  fbf- <dig> and nos- <dig>  which form a complex that binds to the 3' utr of the fem- <dig> mrna  <cit>  and at least six mog genes  <cit> . as a consequence, fog- <dig> and fog- <dig> are repressed and oogenesis occurs. strong loss-of-function  mutations in any of the fog genes  <cit>  or fem genes  <cit>  and gain-of-function  mutations in tra- <dig>  <cit>  completely feminize the germ line and thereby transform the hermaphrodite into a female. conversely tra- <dig> and mog lf mutants  <cit>  and fem- <dig> gf mutants  <cit>  fail to switch from spermatogenesis to oogenesis leading to a female soma with a gonad that is filled with sperm.

the exact mode of action of the six mog genes is not known. in addition to their function in germline sex determination, they are also maternally required for embryonic viability  <cit> . three of the four mog genes that have been cloned so far encode deah box rna helicases, namely, mog- <dig>  mog- <dig> and mog- <dig>  which are the homologs of yeast splicing factors prp <dig>  prp <dig>  and prp <dig>  respectively  <cit> . also ddx- <dig>  which encodes a dead box protein homolgous to the yeast splicing factor prp <dig> was found to be required for the sperm/oocyte switch  <cit> .

deah and dead box proteins belong to the dexd/h rna helicase family, which play many roles in rna metabolism, for example, pre-mrna splicing, ribosome biogenesis, rna transport, translation initiation, and rna decay  <cit> . recently, the classical view that dexd/h proteins are exclusively involved in rna metabolism was contested by evidence that several dexd/h proteins show non-rna related activities that do not require their highly conserved helicase core motifs  <cit> . in c. elegans, several dead box rna helicases are involved in germ line development. loss of glh- <dig> and glh- <dig>  gene functions cause sterility due to failure in oogenesis and spermatogenesis  <cit> . increased germline apoptosis was observed in the cgh- <dig>  mutant  <cit> . mut- <dig> encodes yet another dead box helicase and is essential for germ line transposon inactivation and post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> . other dead box rna helicases are components of the p-granules  <cit> , which are germ cell specific structures  <cit> . p-granules are considered to be pivotal for rna metabolism as they contain many structural rnas  <cit>  and proteins involved in pre-mrna splicing, rna decay and translational activation  <cit> . the exact nature of how these dead box rna helicases participate in the various features of germline development in c. elegans remains elusive.

in total, thirty-seven dead box and  <dig> deah box proteins are encoded in the c. elegans genome  <cit> . systematic analysis of rnai phenotypes suggested that more than half of these genes are essential and many are required for multiple developmental processes. however, for only a few of these genes has the characterization of mutants been reported. here we describe a previously uncharacterized dead box protein-encoding gene, mel- <dig>  loss of mel- <dig> results in defects in several aspects of development. in this study, we particularly focus on the requirement for mel- <dig> in the germ line.

molecular biology
standard techniques of molecular biology were performed as described  <cit> .

microscopy
the specimens were prepared and analyzed following standard procedures  <cit> . for microscopy we used a zeiss axioplan  <dig> microscope fitted with a digital camera  or a zeiss axio imager microscope with a spot camera . both microscopy setups were operated through the program metamorph . the images were processed using either metamorph  or axiovision  and adobe photoshop .

isolation, backcrossing and balancing of the mutations mel- <dig> and mel-46
the mutation mel- <dig> was isolated in a screen for mutations that cause alterations in ceh-13::gfp  expression  <cit> . prior to analysis the strain was backcrossed to n <dig>  <dig> times. during this process the transgene sw1s15v was removed from the strain. the mutation was balanced over nt <dig> , with the free duplication ydp <dig>  or the rescuing extrachromosomal arrays ytex <dig>  or ytex <dig> . temporarily, the mutation was also maintained homozygously at permissive temperature between 15°c and 20°c. the deletion allele mel- <dig> was generated by the national bioresource project for caenorhabditis elegans in japan upon our request and was sent to us by dr s. mitani. the mutation was backcrossed  <dig> times with n <dig> and balanced over the rescuing transgene ytex <dig> resulting in strain qa <dig>  this deletion starts at codon  <dig> of the predicted protein and removes part of exon  <dig> , the entire intron  <dig>  and exon  <dig>  and part of intron  <dig> .

sterility assay and dissection and dapi staining of gonads
mel-46/+ hermaphrodites were raised at 20°c and 25°c. individual l1/l <dig> larvae were placed onto new plates and kept at the respective temperatures. alternatively, progeny of mel- <dig> homozygous animals that had been raised at 15°c were picked and shifted to 25°c. after two days the plates were inspected. animals that had not laid any embryos were considered sterile and animals that had laid all unhatched embryos were considered maternal effect lethal . some of the adults were chosen randomly and their gonads dissected. the gonads were fixed in cold methanol for  <dig> minutes at -20°c, transferred to pbs and dapi  was added at a concentration of  <dig> μg/ml for  <dig> minutes.

determining gonad defects in sterile animals
sterile non-transgenic animals of the strain qa <dig> were raised at 25°c and examined either by nomarski dic microscopy or by epi-illumination fluorescence after dapi staining. 40× and 100× objectives were used for both types of microscopy.

brood size analysis
we placed progeny of mel-46/+ mothers raised at either  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or 25°c individually onto plates that were at the respective growth temperature. all animals were taken from cultures that had been maintained at their respective temperatures for at least two generations. every day these animals were transferred to new plates and the embryos they produced were counted. animals that produced no embryos were considered to be sterile, those that produced only or mainly dying embryos were considered to be mel. mel and sterile animals were considered to be mel- <dig> homozygotes. worms that produced viable progeny were considered to be mel-46/+ or +/+. the data for each temperature are the sum of three independent experiments.

construction and analysis of double mutant strains with fem- <dig>  fog- <dig> and fog-2
the double mutants were constructed as follows.

qa298: fem- <dig> mel-46iv: we crossed cb3844:fem- <dig> hermaphrodites with mel- <dig> males at 15°c. the f <dig> progeny were cultured at 25°c and allowed to reproduce by self-fertilization. f <dig> animals were kept individually at 25°c until  <dig> h after they had laid the first embryos. mel animals  homozygotes) were shifted to 15°c in order to produce viable f <dig> animals. later we lysed the f <dig> animals and searched for the recombinant genotype  by pcr and sequencing. the mel- <dig> fem- <dig> chromosome was made homozygous at 15°c in the following generations and the genotype confirmed. note: the only molecular lesion we found in fem- <dig> was  and not  as originally reported  <cit> . we assume that it is due to a typing error in the original publication.

qa310: fog-1i; mel-46iv: jk560:fog-1i hermaphrodites were crossed with mel- <dig> males at 15°c. the f <dig> generation was raised at 25°c and allowed to reproduce by self-fertilization. f <dig> animals were kept individually at 25°c until  <dig> hours after they had laid the first embryos. mel animals  homozygotes) were shifted to 15°c in order to produce viable f <dig> animals. f <dig> animals were picked individually to plates and double homozygous strains identified by pcr and sequencing of the molecular lesions.

qa311: mel-46iv; fog-2v: jk574:fog- <dig> females were crossed with mel- <dig> males at 15°c. the f <dig> animals were shifted to 25°c and f <dig> animals were raised at 25°c individually. mel non fog f <dig> animals were selected and shifted down to 15°c and allowed to reproduce by self-fertilization. female f <dig> animals  were crossed with fog- <dig> males at 15°c. the resulting  males and females were crossed. in the next generation cultures were started with single pair crosses and double homozygous animals were identified by analysis of both molecular lesions.

analysis of the mutant strains
a large number of the double mutants as well as the corresponding single mutant strains and the wild-type n <dig> strain were cultured at 15°c, then embryos were isolated by hypochloride treatment  <cit> . the embryos were cultured at 15°c for  <dig> hours before the hatched l <dig> larvae were transferred individually to plates and shifted to 25°c where they were incubated for  <dig> hours. we then searched for embryos that were present on the plates. double mutants that produced embryos were kept and the total number of embryos they produced was determined. the data for each set  are the sum of three independent experiments. in each experiment, all four strains were analyzed in parallel.

cloning of mel-46
we determined the approximate location of mel- <dig> at the right of linkage group iv by bulk segregant analysis single nucleotide polymorphism  mapping  <cit> . we then created strain dpy-4mel- <dig> by interbreeding cb1166: dpy- <dig> and mel- <dig> and selecting double homozygotes in the f <dig> generation based on the dpy and the mel phenotypes . we crossed dpy-4mel- <dig> hermaphrodites with cb <dig> males and allowed the progeny to reproduce by self-fertilization. in the next generation we selected dpy non mel animals for snp analysis, which allowed us to place mel- <dig> very close to the right of a snp  at the physical position  <dig>  direct sequencing of candidate genes from the mel- <dig> mutant genomic dna revealed a premature stop  in the predicted gene t06a <dig> . this mutation is neither present in the parental strain qa <dig> nor in the wild type strain n <dig>  the small deletion allele tm <dig> in t06a <dig>   failed to complement mel- <dig> . further we were able to phenocopy the mel- <dig> phenotype by rnai  and to rescue all aspects of the phenotypes of both mutations with a transgene where t06a <dig>  was the only open reading frame .

complementation tests
yt <dig> and tm1739
wild type n <dig> hermaphrodites were crossed with qa158: mel- <dig> homozygous males, which had been growing at 15°c. the resulting males  were crossed with qa273: ytex <dig> ; mel-46iv hermaphrodites. the sur-5::gfp negative hermaphrodite progeny were picked at l <dig> stage and transferred to 25°c. the genotypes of these worms are expected to be 1/ <dig> +/mel- <dig> and 1/ <dig> mel-46/mel- <dig>  of the  <dig> animals analyzed  <dig> gave rise to viable progeny and we confirmed that their genotype was +/mel- <dig> by pcr and by following the phenotypes in the next generation. the remaining  <dig> animals showed a fully penetrant mel phenotype if they produced embryos and we confirmed that their genotype was mel-46/mel-46] by pcr. this indicates that yt <dig> and tm <dig> are allelic.

yt <dig> and ok1475
rb1343: t06a <dig>  hermaphrodites were crossed with mel- <dig> homozygous males, which had been raised at 15°c. none of the f <dig> progeny showed a mel phenotype  at 25°c. we further confirmed the genotype by pcr. therefore yt <dig> and ok <dig> are not allelic.

tm <dig> and ok1475
qa273: ytex <dig> ; mel- <dig> iv hermaphrodites were crossed with wild type males to obtain . the sur-5::gfp negative males were then crossed with rb1343: t06a <dig> . the genotypes of the cross progeny should be 1/ <dig>  and 1/ <dig> . we determined the genotype of  <dig> cross progeny by pcr and sequencing and found  <dig> to be  and  <dig> to be . all these animals grew normally and produced viable progeny. therefore tm <dig> and ok <dig> are not allelic.

yt <dig> and sdf23
bc1227: sdf23/nt <dig> iv; +/nt <dig> v hermaphrodites were crossed with the mel- <dig> homozygous males at 15°c. from the plates that had males we single-picked  <dig> f <dig> hermaphrodites and placed them at 25°c. none of these f <dig> hermaphrodites showed a mel phenotype. as a control we followed the next generation of four randomly selected f1s and confirmed that mel- <dig> was present, showing that the original cross was efficient. this indicates that sdf <dig> does not uncover yt <dig> 

yt <dig> and cyk-2
wh145: cyk- <dig> iv hermaphrodites were crossed with mel- <dig> males at 15°c. we picked many f <dig> progeny  from the plates that had males and transferred them individually to new plates and shifted them to 25°c. the resulting f <dig> produced showed no mel phenotype. this indicates that yt <dig> and cyk- <dig> are not allelic.

double stranded rna interference 
we purchased the t06a <dig>  rnai clone from geneservice ltd  <cit> . the clone contains  <dig> base pairs of genomic sequence  flanked by t <dig> promoters. we amplified the t06a <dig>  region by pcr with t <dig> promoter primers and used the product as template for in vitro transcription using the megascript®  kit following the manufacturer's instructions. the resulting transcripts were heated to 95° for  <dig> minutes, then annealed at room temperature to produce double stranded rna. the rna was diluted in water to approximately  <dig>  μg/μl and injected into the gonads of l <dig> or young adult hermaphrodites as described  <cit> . the injected worms were transferred to new plates  <dig> hours after injection and the progeny they produced was analyzed  <dig> to  <dig> hours after transfer.

transgenics
extrachromosomal transgenes were obtained by micro-injection of dna into the gonad of adult hermaphrodite worms  <cit> . the following concentrations were used to make extra-chromosomal arrays: ytex <dig> and ytex <dig>  ytex <dig>  at  <dig> ng/μl)  <cit> .

determination of the mel- <dig> cdna sequence
total rna was isolated from mixed staged worms using the qiagen midi total rna kit  according to the manufacturer's instructions. reverse transcription was carried out with superscript™ ii reverse transcriptase  according to the manufacturer's instructions with random hexamer primers  or primer bj <dig>  . one μl of the reverse transcription reaction was used as template for first round of pcr  using a primer against sl <dig>  or a primer that is complementary to bj <dig> and different internal primers. one μl of the first round pcr was used as template for a second round of pcr with nested primers. a full list of all the primers used for the race experiments is available upon request. two overlapping partial cdna clones were generated. prm3: a  <dig> bp fragment extending from the splice leader sl <dig> to exon  <dig> was amplified using primers rm589-5'-ggttcctctgtaaaatcgaatttcgtc-3' and rs234-5'-ggtttaattacccaagtttgag-3' and cloned into topo pcr <dig> . prm5: a  <dig> bp fragment ranging from exon  <dig> to the poly tail was amplified using primers rm698- 5'-gaaaaatagccaattcgacagg-3' and bj <dig>  and cloned into topo pcr <dig> clones . the full-length cdna clone prm <dig> was created by replacing the noti  – sali  fragment of prm <dig> with the noti – sali fragment of prm <dig>  the full-length mel- <dig> cdna is  <dig> bp.

genbank accession number
the accession number for the full-length mel- <dig> cdna sequence is .

making of mel- <dig> rescue constructs
the noti  – sali  fragment of prm <dig>  the clone that contains the full length mel- <dig> cdna, was replaced with the genomic noti-sali fragment that extends from  <dig> bp upstream of the translational start codon to exon  <dig>  the genomic fragment was created by pcr amplification with primers rm1033-tatagcggccgctgcatgtgaagtggaaccat and rm1031-accagcgttaaaccgaacaa followed by the restriction digestion with noti and sali. the resulting plasmid prm <dig> hence consists of  <dig> bp promoter, exons and introns  <dig> –  <dig>  exons  <dig> –  <dig> and the mel- <dig> 3'utr in the backbone of topo pcr <dig> 

anti-mel- <dig> antibody and western blotting
a polyclonal anti-mel- <dig> antibody was raised against the peptide cpfeerlrrqrkrek  and affinity purified by biogenes, berlin. for western blotting, approximately  <dig> μl of worms were harvested and dissolved in  <dig> μl of sample buffer  by boiling for five minutes. after adjusting the approximate concentration of the protein samples, 5– <dig> μl per lane were loaded onto standard sds-page gels. these gels were blotted onto hybond-p nylon membranes  according to the manufacturers' instructions. for detection the anti-mel- <dig> antibodies were used at 1: <dig>  for the loading control, a polyclonal anti-alpha-tubulin antibody  was used at 1: <dig>  as secondary antibody, we used an alkaline phosphatase conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody from dianova  at 1: <dig> dilution and we detected the signals using the premixed pcip/nbt solution  according to manufacturer's instructions.

RESULTS
isolation of the mutation yt5
the yt <dig> allele was originally isolated in a genetic screen for mutations that abolish or alter the expression of an early embryonic ceh-13::gfp reporter construct   <cit> . at 25°c yt <dig> homozygous hermaphrodites displayed various defects in the germ line  and those animals that were not sterile showed a fully penetrant maternal effect lethal  phenotype. based on this phenotype, the gene genetically defined by yt <dig> was named mel- <dig>  mel- <dig> is not a null allele. however, the facts that it is fully recessive and that mel- <dig> rnai experiments lead to a fully penetrant mel phenotype and loss of ceh-13::gfp expression  suggest that yt <dig> is a loss-of-function allele . embryos that are the progeny of mel- <dig> homozygous mothers invariably die with about  <dig> cells without any sign of morphogenesis and fail to express ceh-13::gfp . at 20°c and below, the mel phenotype is incompletely but still highly  penetrant while most embryos express the ceh-13::gfp marker normally . mel- <dig> males can sire a considerable number of progeny at 15°c. at 25°c they appear to be sterile although they look morphologically wild type. the details of the phenotype in the embryos will be described elsewhere and this publication concentrates on the cloning of mel- <dig> and its requirement in the germ line.

mel- <dig> encodes a putative dead box rna helicase
using a combination of classical two-point mapping and snp mapping we mapped the mutation yt <dig> to position  <dig>  on the right arm of chromosome iv . yt <dig> complemented the maternal effect lethal mutation cyk- <dig> and the deficiency sdf <dig>  both of which reside in this region. we identified a point mutation in the predicted gene t06a <dig>  of yt <dig> homozygotes that introduced a premature translational stop codon towards the end of exon  <dig> . further, we received a small deletion allele  that removes  <dig> bp and is likely to be a full knock out . tm <dig> failed to complement yt <dig>  however, tm <dig> homozygous animals arrest as l <dig> larvae. this indicates that there is a zygotic function of mel- <dig> that can be fulfilled by the yt <dig> mutant form of mel- <dig>  the upstream part of mel- <dig> overlaps with a non-coding exon of another predicted gene, t06a <dig> . this predicted gene is transcribed in the opposite direction . to exclude the possibility that this gene was responsible for some of the effects we observed, we requested the deletion allele ok <dig> that takes out most of the coding region of t06a <dig>  from exon  <dig> to exon  <dig> . the deletion is  <dig> bp upstream of the mel- <dig> translation start codon at the physical position  <dig> to  <dig>  ok <dig> is homozygous viable and fully complemented mel- <dig> and mel- <dig>  further, a transgene that contained all of t06a <dig> , but not the entire t06a <dig> , rescued the yt <dig> and tm <dig> mutations and rnai with t06a <dig>  phenocopied mel- <dig> . from these results we conclude that t06a <dig>  is mel- <dig>  we determined the gene structure by analyzing the mel- <dig> cdna . mel- <dig> encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein that contains a dead box and a helicase domain . mel- <dig> and human ddx20/gemin3/dp <dig> are reciprocal best blast hits, indicating that these two proteins are related. the similarity is, however, limited to the n-terminal half of the protein that contains the dead box and the helicase domain.

mel- <dig> is expressed throughout development
in situ hybridization images available from the nematode expression pattern database  show a strong signal in the gonad of the adult and in young embryos, which indicates that the rna is present at these stages. quantitative rt-pcr experiments confirmed this finding but also showed that the rna is not restricted to adults and embryos and is also in the somatic tissues of adults . to determine when and where the mel- <dig> protein is present, we raised an antibody against an oligo-peptide . on western blots the antibody recognizes a band above the  <dig> kd marker in extracts from wild type  worms . in mel- <dig> mutants there is a novel band below the  <dig> kd marker. in extracts from worms that were homozygous for mel- <dig> and carried a wild type copy of the gene on a rescuing transgene, both bands are visible. finally, in worms that are homozygous for the putative null allele mel- <dig> and rescued by a transgene, only the wild type band is visible. this shows that the antibody recognizes mel- <dig> and that the truncated protein is present in the yt <dig> mutants.

consistent with the pleiotropic phenotype of the mutation, the mel- <dig> protein is present at all developmental stages  and is not limited to the hermaphrodite germ line in adults since it is also found in hermaphrodites that lack a germ line or have a germ line that is either masculinized or feminized .

mel- <dig> is a partially penetrant temperature sensitive sterile allele
at 25°c about one third of the mel- <dig> homozygous hermaphrodites that were the progeny of heterozygous mothers were sterile, meaning they did not produce any embryos . the penetrance of the sterility was somewhat higher in animals that were the progeny of homozygous mothers and were shifted from 15°c to 25°c at the l <dig> stage . this effect is fully temperature sensitive since we did not observe any sterile worms at 20°c . in order to further analyze the germline defects, we dissected gonads from mel- <dig> hermaphrodites and their non-mutant siblings and stained them with dapi. the mutants were picked randomly without paying attention if they were sterile or mel. among  <dig> gonads analyzed from mel- <dig> animals that were raised at 25°c,  <dig>  showed obvious defects . the manifestation of these defects was temperature dependent because of the  <dig> gonads from mel- <dig> animals that were raised at 20°c, all looked superficially normal. in the following we analyzed sterile and fertile animals separately.

a the mothers and the analyzed progeny were permanently kept at the indicated temperature. b the analyzed worms where shifted to the temperature indicated as l <dig> larvae. c phenotypically wild type, these worms were considered to be mel-46/+ or +/+.d maternal effect lethal, these worms produced embryos, most  or all  of which arrested with less than  <dig> cells . e these worms did not produce any embryos. f mel and sterile worms were considered to be mutant.

a all animals were the progeny of mel-46/ + mothers. animals that produced predominantly  or exclusively  dying embryos were considered to be mel- <dig> homozygous. b number of gonads with any of the defects described in the text. c number of gonads analyzed.

to get an idea of what might cause the sterility we inspected the gonads of sterile mel- <dig> animals more closely. among  <dig> gonad arms analyzed, none contained normal, mature oocytes and we could divide them into three classes of defects: class 1: the germ lines failed to produce mature oocytes. instead, smaller oocyte-like cells, also called ooids, were generated . however, the overall organization of the germ line was normal. the number of ooids varied from  <dig> to  <dig> ooids or more per gonadal arm. occasionally, ooid nuclei had entered diakinesis . the amount of sperm was variable as well, ranging from less than  <dig> to  <dig> cells per gonad arm, the average being  <dig>  fifty-one  of the  <dig> gonadal arms fell into this class.

class 2: a more severely disorganized arrangement of germ nuclei. sperm, spermatocytes and ooids were mixed within the same region of the gonad . typically ooid nuclei had not entered diakinesis. four  of the  <dig> gonadal arms belonged to this class.

class 3: worms with gonads that were much smaller than normal. gonadal arms were thinner and contained less than  <dig> nuclei in mitosis or in meiotic prophase. neither oocytes nor ooids have been observed in these germ lines . two  of the  <dig> gonadal arms belonged to this class.

the animals that were not sterile showed a temperature dependent reduction in the number of embryos they produced, here referred to as brood size . while the brood sizes of mel- <dig> mothers were not significantly different from their non-mutant siblings at 15°c and at 20°c, their brood sizes were clearly reduced at 23°c  and at 25°c .

a all animals were the progeny of mel- <dig> / + mothers. animals that produced predominantly  or exclusively dying embryos were considered to be mel- <dig> homozygous. b only animals that were fertile were included in this analysis. c two tailed paired t-test between the genotypes within the temperature.

mel- <dig> weakly suppresses some mutations that cause germline feminization
as described above, in many mel- <dig> gonads germ cells failed to differentiate as oocytes. however, all worms made sperm and some even showed an elevated number of sperm, which lead us to suspect that mel- <dig> leads to a slight masculinization of the germ line. to test this hypothesis we asked if mel- <dig> can suppress mutations that feminize the germ line. the mutations fog- <dig>  fog- <dig> and fem- <dig> are known to completely feminize the germ line leading to complete self-sterility  <cit>  and are at the bottom , the top  or in the middle  of the genetic cascade that determines germline sex  <cit>  . we constructed double mutant strains for mel- <dig> with these three mutations and asked if the double mutants would produce embryos, indicating that they made functional sperm. we found that mel- <dig> was capable of weakly suppressing fog- <dig> and fem- <dig> but not fog- <dig> . sixteen  out of  <dig> mel-46; fog- <dig> gave rise to an average of  <dig> embryos per hermaphrodite while none of the fog- <dig> single mutants produced any embryos . eighteen  out of  <dig> fem- <dig> mel- <dig> produced an average of  <dig> embryos per animal while none of the fem- <dig> worms produced embryos . all embryos produced by either of the two double mutants arrested with a phenotype indistinguishable from mel- <dig> mutants. on the other hand, neither fog- <dig> single mutant  nor fog-1; mel- <dig>  animals produced any embryos. in spite of the caveat that the mutant alleles used in our analyses are not null , altogether, our results suggest that mel- <dig> masculinizes the germ line and acts downstream of or in parallel with fem- <dig> and fog- <dig> and our results are consistent with a role of mel- <dig> upstream of fog- <dig> 

aindividuals that produced live progeny. b individuals that produced dying embryos .c animals that did not produce any embryos. values in the brackets are the percentage of the total animals analyzed. all experiments were done at 25°c.

discussion
here we report the genetic isolation, molecular cloning and an initial phenotypic analysis of the gene mel- <dig>  this gene encodes a protein of the dead box family and is required for embryogenesis, larval development and proper germline differentiation. interestingly, also the mouse and the fly homologs of mel- <dig> were recently shown to be required for development and for proper function of the germ line. mouillet et al.   <cit>  demonstrated that murine dp103/ddx <dig> is essential for early embryogenesis and influences ovarian morphology and function. mutations in the drosophila melanogaster ddx <dig> ortholog, gemin <dig>  lead to larval arrest and defects in the nurse cells in the germ line <cit> .

in c. elegans, the mutant phenotype of mel- <dig> is very reminiscent of the phenotype of ddx- <dig>  a gene that also encodes a dead box protein. ddx- <dig> is homologous to human ddx <dig> and the yeast splicing factor prp <dig>  analysis of mutants and rnai knock down demonstrated that this gene is also required for embryonic viability, larval development and proper germline growth and differentiation, including the sperm-oocyte switch  <cit> .

it is quite common that dead/h box proteins play multiple roles, both genetically and biochemically. a systematic rnai analysis of genes that encode helicase like proteins suggested that many dead/h box protein encoding genes are required multiple times during c. elegans development  <cit> . many proteins of this family possess rna helicase activity and use atp hydrolysis as an energy source to unwind rna structures or separate rna-protein complexes  <cit> . however, several members of this family are also involved in transcriptional regulation  <cit> . for example the mammalian ddx20/gemin3/dp <dig> protein has been independently isolated as a transcriptional regulator of viral and nuclear genes   <cit> , and as a component of the nuclear and cytoplasmic smn complex   <cit> , which plays roles in snrnp metabolism.

mel- <dig> alleles
we describe two different mutant alleles of mel- <dig>  the first one, yt <dig>  is the reference allele and its molecular lesion is a premature stop codon towards the end of the penultimate exon. the second allele, tm <dig>  is a small deletion that takes out the entire exon  <dig> and would introduce a translational frame shift in the conserved dead box if exon  <dig> were spliced to exon  <dig>  this mutation is therefore very likely to be a null. yt <dig> is temperature sensitive, and even at the restrictive temperature of 25°c, it is not null. the knockout allele tm <dig> causes larval lethality that we did not observe in yt <dig> homozygous and yt5/tm <dig> trans-heterozygous animals. consistent with this idea, a truncated mel- <dig> protein is present in mel- <dig> mutants  and might still perform some of the functions. the fact that yt <dig> is temperature sensitive and the yt <dig> mutant animals develop to adulthood allowed us to study the function of mel- <dig> in the germ line. however, we cannot completely exclude a neomorphic contribution to the phenotype that is caused by the truncated protein. however the yt <dig> mutation is fully recessive and mel- <dig> rnai experiments lead to a fully penetrant mel phenotype that was indistinguishable from that of yt <dig>  indicating that yt <dig> is essentially a loss-of-function allele.

germline defects in mel-46
at 25°c mel- <dig> mutants display a range of germline defects. some of the mel- <dig> adults produce embryos that undergo several rounds of cell division, indicating that these animals make functional gametes of both sexes. however, they have smaller broods than wild type animals demonstrating that their germ line is not entirely normal. other hermaphrodites were defective in the proper formation of oocytes and did not produce any embryos. all animals did form normal looking sperm. in addition, mel- <dig> can partially suppress the complete self-sterility of the fog- <dig> and fem- <dig> but not fog- <dig>  although the suppression was weak it has to be taken into consideration that we were asking for suppression of feminizing mutations to the point that the double mutants produced functional sperm and functional oocytes. being so rigorous it is very likely that we underestimate the masculinizing effect of mel- <dig>  our results are consistent with a genetic requirement of mel- <dig> for female germ cell differentiation downstream or in parallel of fog- <dig> and fem- <dig> and upstream of fog- <dig>  however, although all mutant alleles used in this study are fully penetrant at 25°c, it has to be noticed that they are probably not null. for this reason and because the sex determining pathway is quite complex, the epistatic relationship of mel- <dig> with these three genes cannot be definitely determined with our assays. although mel- <dig> clearly leads to a partial masculinization of the germ line, at the moment we do not know if this mutation affects sex determination specifically or if it also influences the function of other genes. the mel- <dig> phenotype cannot be considered a classical mog phenotype for various reasons. first, mog animals produce large amounts of sperm . we observed only a small fraction of animals with a slightly elevated sperm count and the average number of sperm was normal. second, in the few mog mutants that occasionally produce limited amounts of oocytes when grown at permissive temperature, the spermatogenic region is distinct from that of oogenesis  <cit> . this is different in mel- <dig> animals, as ooids were sometimes mixed with sperm. third, when mog animals are maintained to produce oocytes or ooids ), oocyte nuclei enter diakinesis with their chromosomes well separated . in contrast in mel- <dig> mutants of class  <dig>  only a small subset of ooids entered diakinesis. moreover, such nuclei are significantly smaller as compared to those in mog- <dig> animals . therefore, we suggest that the mel- <dig> phenotype is primarily a defect in oocyte differentiation.

CONCLUSIONS
here we report the genetic isolation, cloning and molecular and phenotypic characterization of the c. elegans gene mel- <dig>  this gene encodes a putative dead box helicase and is required at least three times during development, namely: i) maternally for embryogenesis; ii) zygotically for progression through larval development and iii) in the hermaphrodite germ line. consistent with these observations, we found the mel- <dig> protein to be present at all developmental stages and in the germ line and in the soma. in this publication we focus on the requirement of mel- <dig> in the hermaphrodite germ line. we demonstrate that mel- <dig> weakly suppresses the feminizing mutations fog- <dig> and fem- <dig> but not fog- <dig>  although this genetic interaction indicates a certain feminizing activity of mel- <dig> in the germ line, we speculate that its primary function is in oocyte differentiation rather than sex determination.
