BACKGROUND
the low solubility product constants of calcium phosphate salts provide a chemical rationale for the evolution of ca2+ as a universal second messenger. the necessity to decrease cytosolic ca2+ concentrations to submicromolar levels by exporting the cation into extracellular spaces or intracellular compartments that do not generate atp, such as the endoplasmic reticulum or vacuole, creates a steep concentration gradient that allows for the controlled and gated generation of rapid ca2+ transients in response to extracellular stimuli. such intracellular ca2+ signals are not only characterized by their magnitudes but also by their spatial and temporal resolution. the sum of these parameters is often referred to as the 'ca2+ signature' of a primary stimulus  <cit> . numerous environmental cues of biotic and abiotic nature and endogenous physiological and developmental conditions trigger specific ca2+ signatures  <cit> . stimulus-specific ca2+ oscillations are generated by voltage- and ligand-gated ca2+-permeable channels , and by ca2+-atpases and antiporters  to regain resting ca2+ levels  <cit> . approximately  <dig> genes coding for potential ca2+ channels, pumps and antiporters have been identified in the arabidopsis genome, suggesting complex generation and regulation of stimulus-specific ca2+ signatures  <cit> .

calcium spikes are recognized by several ca2+-binding proteins and are decoded via ca2+-dependent conformational changes in these sensor polypeptides and interacting target proteins  <cit> . several classes of ca2+ sensors have been identified in plants that contain a ca2+-binding helix-loop-helix fold known as the ef-hand motif. calmodulin is the archetypal ca2+ sensor, which is exceptionally conserved in eukaryotes and contains four ef-hand motifs. about  <dig> ef-hand motif-containing proteins have been identified in arabidopsis  <cit> , including six typical calmodulins and  <dig> calmodulin-like proteins that differ significantly in sequence and number of ef-hand motifs  <cit> . members of a second, plant-specific family of ca2+ sensors, which usually contain three ef-hand motifs, have similarity to the regulatory b-subunit of calcineurin in animals and are referred to as calcineurin b-like  proteins  <cit> . while calmodulins and cbl sensor proteins have no catalytic activity on their own and therefore are sometimes referred to as 'ca2+ sensor relays', a third major class of ca2+ sensors are bifunctional proteins, known as ca2+-dependent protein kinases , which contain a calmodulin-like domain with four ef-hand motifs and a ca2+-dependent, ser/thr protein kinase domain on a single polypeptide chain  <cit> . because of their dual functions as ca2+-binding proteins and catalytic effectors the cdpk proteins are considered 'ca2+ sensor responders'. in arabidopsis, cdpk and cbl proteins are encoded by multigene families of  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively  <cit> . cdpks play essential roles in hormone and stress signaling pathways as well as in plant responses to pathogens  <cit> .

to transmit the information of the second messenger, ca2+ sensor relays such as calmodulins and cbl proteins interact with target proteins and regulate their biochemical activities. during the final phase of the transduction process, the target proteins modulate diverse cellular activities to establish the specific response to a given extracellular signal. the cbl sensor proteins interact specifically in a ca2+-dependent fashion with a single family of snf1-like ser/thr protein kinases, known as cbl-interacting protein kinases or cipks, which are encoded by  <dig> genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . current data indicate that cbl-cipk interaction networks provide a signaling module for integrating plant responses to an array of environmental stimuli  <cit> . in contrast to cbl sensor proteins, which regulate a select set of target protein kinases, calmodulins interact with an astonishingly large number of target proteins. these have been extensively reviewed and include among other functional categories, proteins implicated in generating ca2+ signatures, enzymes in signaling and metabolic pathways, and transcriptional regulators  <cit> . the calmodulin-interacting domains of target proteins are not necessarily related in structure and exhibit high sequence variability, which may reflect the versatility of the calmodulin sensor relay. nonetheless, calmodulin-interacting domains usually consist of a short  basic amphiphilic helix, which is recognized by a flexible hydrophobic pocket that forms upon ca2+ binding to calmodulin  <cit> . three calmodulin recruitment motifs are currently known although not all functionally characterized calmodulin-binding domains contain these specific motifs: the iq motif  is thought to mediate calmodulin retention in a ca2+-independent manner, whereas ca2+-dependent interaction can be achieved by two related motifs, termed 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig>  which are distinguished by their spacing of bulky hydrophobic and basic amino acid residues  <cit> . using various biochemical approaches, about  <dig> target proteins have been identified in arabidopsis, a number that is expected to rise  <cit> .

in a genetic screen for regulatory factors of the glucosinolate homeostasis in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit> , we have recently identified a gene coding for a calmodulin-binding protein with similarity to sf <dig> from sunflower  <cit> . we termed this protein iqd <dig> for the presence of a plant-specific domain of  <dig> conserved amino acids , which is characterized by a unique and repetitive arrangement of iq, 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig> calmodulin recruitment motifs. we demonstrated by biochemical and genetic studies that iqd <dig> is a nuclear calmodulin-binding protein that stimulates glucosinolate accumulation and plant defense  <cit> . in this study, we present a comparative genome-wide analysis of the entire iqd gene families in arabidopsis thaliana  and oryza sativa , which are predicted to encode proteins sharing the iq <dig> domain. our genomics analysis provides the framework for future studies to dissect the function of this emerging family of novel calmodulin target proteins.

RESULTS
identification and structure of iqd genes in arabidopsis thaliana
in a previous study, we characterized iqd <dig> as a calcium-dependent calmodulin-binding protein and identified six closely related genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . the encoded proteins share a conserved central region of  <dig> amino acid residues, referred to as the iq <dig> domain, which is characterized by the occurrence of multiple calmodulin-binding motifs  <cit>  that are arranged in a unique repetitive pattern. the iq <dig> domain contains 1– <dig> copies each of the iq motif , the 1-5- <dig> motif , and the 1-8- <dig> motif . in addition, several conserved basic and hydrophobic amino acid residues are flanking these motifs, and the iq <dig> domain is predicted to fold into a basic amphiphilic helix .

to uncover the entire family of genes coding for iqd proteins in the arabidopsis genome, we searched available arabidopsis databases with multiple blast algorithms using full-length iqd <dig>  and its iq <dig> domain as the query sequences, followed by additional searches with related sequences . in addition, we performed a pattern search with the iq motif and its degenerate versions as the query sequences and inspected each hit for the presence of an iq <dig> domain. we subsequently performed pair-wise sequence comparisons to exclude redundant entries from the initial data set, which is frequently caused by multiple identification numbers of the same dna or protein sequence in the databases. a total of  <dig> non-redundant putative iqd genes were extracted from these sources . full-length cdna or est sequences were available for  <dig> of those genes, and we attempted to clone by reverse transcriptase-mediated pcr cdna sequences for the remaining seven genes. we succeeded to generate full-length cdnas for three additional genes, at1g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig>  but were unable to amplify cdnas for at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at3g <dig>  to date, no evidence is available supporting the expression of at1g <dig> and at3g <dig> . a comparison of the  <dig> genomic loci with their corresponding cdna sequences revealed that most of the predicted gene models are correct, with only three exceptions . the full-length cdna of at4g <dig> encodes a protein that is  <dig> amino acid residues longer than the protein predicted by the mips matdb annotation. this discrepancy is caused by the erroneous and superfluous annotation of a fifth intron in the last coding exon. for at2g <dig>  the translational start site and the 5' border of the first intron were misannotated for the mips matdb entry when compared with its full-length cdna. the available cdna for at1g <dig>  annotated as a full-length cdna , encodes only three exons but is likely truncated at its 5'-end because  at1g <dig> and at4g <dig> are paralogous genes that evolved by a segmental duplication event , and  the at4g <dig> gene model of five coding exons is supported by a full-length cdna sequence. we therefore consider the mips matdb annotation of at1g <dig>  to be correct. the gene models of at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at3g <dig> and at3g <dig> remain to be verified as no full-length cdna sequences are available. structural examination of the  <dig> putative iqd genes revealed the presence of 2– <dig> translated exons, suggesting that iqd proteins are quite diverse. almost two-thirds of the gene family  contains more than four protein-coding exons, and  <dig> genes encode one or two non-translated exons in their 5'-region . all introns of most iqd genes are phase- <dig> introns, separating exactly two triplet codons  <cit> . the last intron of at1g <dig> is in phase- <dig>  which lies between the second and third nucleotide of joining codons, and a phase- <dig> intron is found in five other iqd genes . the average size of iqd genes in arabidopsis is  <dig>  kb .

predicted primary structure and properties of arabidopsis iqd proteins
having identified non-redundant and verified potential iqd protein coding sequences, we developed a set of criteria for the presence of the iq <dig> domain in the  <dig> predicted arabidopsis proteins. the iq <dig> domain is characterized by the precise spacing of three copies of the 11-amino acid iq motif, which are separated by short sequences of  <dig> and  <dig> amino acid residues . the first iq motif is best conserved , followed by the second  and third  iq repeat. although the third iq motif shows the highest degree of sequence degeneration, its initial hydrophobic amino acid and following glutamine residue are present in  <dig> proteins. each iq motif is congruent with a 1-5- <dig> motif of hydrophobic amino acids, which again is least conserved for the last iq motif. a fourth 1-5- <dig> motif overlaps the first spacer sequence and second iq motif. each iq motif also partially overlaps with a 1-8- <dig> motif. besides these repetitive motifs, the iq <dig> domain is characterized by the presence of additional conserved hydrophobic and basic amino acid residues flanking each iq motif . a hallmark of iqd genes is the presence of a phase- <dig> intron at an invariant position within the coding region of the iq <dig> domain that disrupts codon  <dig> and  <dig> . at5g <dig> is the only exception to this rule, which encodes the entire iq <dig> domain on its second and central exon . given these criteria,  <dig> proteins contain at least two or three discernible iq motifs with the accompanying 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig> motifs in their iq <dig> domain, which we therefore consider bona fide iqd proteins. the protein encoded by at5g <dig> does not meet these criteria because it only contains the first, albeit truncated iq motif provided by the n-terminal exon of the iq <dig> domain . the exon coding for the remainder of the iq <dig> domain  is missing and replaced by an unrelated exon in at5g <dig> . however, the at5g <dig> protein shares five common amino acid sequence motifs outside the iq <dig> domain with a large set of iqd proteins as detected by comparative meme  analysis  <cit>  of the complete amino acid sequences of the  <dig> arabidopsis proteins . as most of these motifs are unique to iqd proteins, we consider at5g <dig> a member of the iqd gene family in arabidopsis. since amino acids 17– <dig> of the iq <dig> domain are encoded by the second or third exon of iqd genes, the iq <dig> domain contributes to the core region of most iqd proteins. an interesting exception is at3g <dig>  which is the smallest member of the iqd protein family in arabidopsis and consists of a c-terminal iq <dig> domain and a short n-terminal extension of  <dig> amino acid residues.

since at3g <dig> is predicted to encode a 'minimal' iqd protein , we tested whether calmodulin interacts with recombinant iqd <dig>  we employed the same co-sedimentation assay that we recently used to demonstrate ca2+-dependent binding of iqd <dig> to bovine calmodulin  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  an epitope tagged t7-iqd <dig> fusion protein preferentially co-sedimented with calmodulin-agarose beads in the presence of ca2+, whereas noticeably less t7-iqd <dig> protein was bound to immobilized calmodulin when the incubation mix and wash buffer were supplemented with egta. thus, our data indicate that the smallest member of the iqd protein family in arabidopsis interacts with calmodulin in a ca2+-independent manner but suggest that calmodulin binding is possibly stimulated by the presence of ca2+ ions. we interrogated the web-based calmodulin target database, which computes various structural and biophysical parameters of a given protein sequence to predict calmodulin binding sites  <cit> . this analysis predicted that iqd <dig> and all other iqd proteins of arabidopsis contain, in addition to multiple iq motifs, strings of high-scoring amino acid residues that indicate the location of putative calmodulin interaction sites . the predicted calmodulin binding sites overlap with the iq <dig> domain in  <dig> of the  <dig> iqd protein sequences .

a roman numerals correspond to subfamilies and subgroups of iqd proteins as used in figure  <dig> and figure  <dig> 

b putative calmodulin-binding sites predicted by the calmodulin target database  <cit>  are shown for strings of amino acid residues with a score of at least "7". residues with the highest score  are highlighted in bold.

although the predicted iqd proteins are quite diverse with respect to size  and computed molecular mass , they appear to be remarkably uniform in terms of their relatively high theoretical isoelectric point , the only exception being at1g <dig> , and with respect to the abundance of ala , ser , and basic amino acid residues . to uncover the possible subcellular localization of iqd proteins in arabidopsis, we searched for different signature motifs specific to cellular compartments. because of their high content of basic residues, and as suggested by psort, at least half of the iqd protein family  may be localized in the cell nucleus . this conjecture is supported by the presence of several basic clusters in iqd proteins that conform to the sv40-type, matα2-type, and bipartite type of nuclear localization signals  <cit> , and by the nuclear localization of an iqd1-gfp fusion protein  <cit> . the remaining iqd proteins are predicted to be localized in the mitochondria , chloroplasts , or unknown compartments .

chromosomal distribution and homology of arabidopsis iqd genes
to infer clustering patterns that reflect iqd protein sequence similarity and evolutionary ancestry, we constructed phylogenetic trees by the neighbor-joining method  <cit>  using iqd full-length sequences and the amino acid sequence of at5g <dig> as outgroup. the at5g <dig> gene encodes a c-terminally truncated iq <dig> domain that lacks amino acid residues 17– <dig> . the phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis iqd gene family reveals four well-resolved subfamilies, two of which can be further divided into subgroups supported by the presence and position of introns, the occurrence of common protein motifs outside the iq <dig> domain, and bootstrapping values . large segmental duplications of chromosomal regions during evolution, followed by gene loss, small-scale duplications and local rearrangements, have created the present complexities of the arabidopsis genome  <cit> . these events have likely shaped the size and structure of the current iqd gene family. we therefore analyzed the evolutionary history of iqd genes, which are relatively evenly distributed among all five arabidopsis chromosomes . the topology of the phylogenetic tree  suggests for several iqd genes in all subfamilies a clear paralogous pattern of gene divergence by gene duplication. using the arabidopsis redundancy viewer , the viewer of segmental genome duplications  and the searchable supplementary material provided by blanc et al.  <cit>  and simillion et al.  <cit> , we found that  <dig> of the  <dig> iqd genes are located in previously identified chromosomal duplications  <cit> . eight pairs of duplicated iqd genes have been retained during evolution, whereas the iqd sister gene has been lost for each of the other  <dig> duplication events . all  <dig> duplications involving iqd genes occurred during the relatively recent genome-wide duplication event  <dig> ±  <dig> myr ago, as estimated by simillion et al.  <cit> . in most cases, the paralogous relationships indicated by segmental duplication are supported by the exon-intron organization and the phylogeny of the iqd gene pairs . the following pairs of genes are therefore close paralogous iqd genes in arabidopsis, sharing 50–67% amino acid sequence identity: at1g <dig> and at4g00820; at1g <dig> and at2g02790; at1g <dig> and at1g72670; at1g <dig> and at1g74690; at1g <dig> and at3g16490; at2g <dig> and at3g59690; at3g <dig> and at5g03040; at5g <dig> and at5g <dig>  two orphan genes contained in opposite parts of a duplicated segment pair on chromosome iii and iv, at3g <dig> and at4g <dig>  group in different subfamilies of the phylogenetic tree and share substantially lower primary structure identity  as well as less preservation of exon-intron organization , suggesting reciprocal iqd sister gene loss after duplication of a chromosomal segment that contained two ancestral iqd genes. the genes at2g <dig> and at3g <dig> also appear to be closely related paralogs ; however they are positioned in different previously identified duplication segments, which points to a more complex evolutionary history. as expected, iqd genes of atypical structure  or encoding atypical proteins  are either singleton genes , or orphan genes  whose homologous sister gene has been lost after duplication. two pairs of closely positioned singleton genes, one each on chromosome iii and iv, and two clustered genes in a duplicated segment on chromosome iv , suggest ancient tandem or local duplication events that have already resulted in substantial gene diversification . in summary, large-scale segmental duplication events appear to have exclusively contributed to the current complexity of the iqd gene family.

identification and predicted properties of the iqd protein complement in oryza sativa
we next explored the occurrence and size of the iqd gene family in the extensively sequenced genome of rice  <cit> . blast searches in several databases of o. sativa ssp. japonica and indica  using several arabidopsis full-length iqd protein sequences as the queries identified  <dig> different loci that encode non-redundant putative iqd proteins in rice. the general features of rice iqd genes and proteins are summarized in table  <dig> and table  <dig>  full-length cdna sequences are available for  <dig> genes and generally support the respective gene model, with the exception of two loci  that are incorrectly annotated . the putative full-length cdna sequences of two additional genes  are likely truncated in their coding region when compared with the conceptual translation products of each corresponding locus. a gene model could not be derived for the os01m <dig> locus in either o. sativa subspecies that covers the open reading frame of a corresponding partial cdna sequence. to date, independent evidence for gene expression has been obtained for six of the remaining ten iqd family members for which a full-length cdna is currently not available, suggesting that most iqd genes are functional in rice . as for arabidopsis, rice iqd genes encode 2– <dig> translated exons; however, less than half of the rice family members  contain more than four exons . furthermore, all introns in most osiqd genes are in phase-0; only six genes contain a phase- <dig> intron in their 3'-region and one gene  is characterized by the presence of two phase- <dig> and one phase- <dig> intron in its 5'-region . rice iqd genes are slightly larger than arabidopsis iqd genes, which is a result of increased intron length .

conceptual translation of full-length cdna or predicted mrna sequences and computation of theoretical physico-chemical protein parameters reveal that the iqd protein complement in rice is remarkably similar to the iqd protein family in arabidopsis . comparative meme analysis of the complete amino acid sequences of the  <dig> rice iqd proteins identified a similar set of conserved sequence motifs and their distribution along the polypeptide chain as found for members of the arabidopsis iqd protein family . the iq <dig> domain is positioned close to the core region of iqd polypeptides and is characterized by the same hallmarks as described for the arabidopsis family, including the location and spacing of the three calmodulin-binding motifs , and the position of an invariant phase- <dig> intron that separates codon  <dig> and  <dig> of the iq <dig> domain . as predicted by interrogation of the calmodulin target database  <cit> , all rice iqd proteins contain additional putative calmodulin binding sequences that often overlap with the iq <dig> domain . it is interesting to note that the rice iqd gene family contains members with similar deviations from consensus properties as observed for the iqd gene family in arabidopsis. these exceptions include loss of the phase- <dig> intron between the iq <dig> domain-coding exons , replacement of the second exon coding for amino acids 17– <dig> of the iq <dig> domain , c-terminal location of the iq <dig> domain , and an unusually large and acidic protein . since the rice iqd proteins display a similar range of structural and physico-chemical characteristics as the iqd family in arabidopsis, it is very likely that we have identified most of the iqd family members in rice. again, the majority of the family members  may be targeted to the cell nucleus; the remaining iqd proteins are predicted to be localized in the mitochondria , chloroplasts , or unknown compartments .

b sequences were obtained from the meme analysis of the  <dig> arabidopsis and rice iqd full length proteins. only consensus sequences that are shared by at least four arabidopsis iqd proteins are listed.

chromosomal distribution of rice iqd genes
unlike the arabidopsis iqd gene family, which is evenly distributed over all arabidopsis chromosomes, the distribution of iqd genes in the rice genome is clearly biased towards three chromosomes. almost half of the rice iqd gene family members  are contained in chromosomes i and v, and five genes are present on chromosome iii. three iqd genes are each found on chromosomes iv and vi, while seven of the twelve rice chromosomes contain either one or no iqd gene locus . such a heterogeneous distribution of iqd genes over the different rice chromosomes is consistent with an ancient aneuploidy event, which has been proposed to have occurred in rice about  <dig> myr ago  <cit> , and not with a whole-genome duplication or polyploidization event. duplicated segments cover substantial regions of chromosome v  and chromosome i , the second and third largest fraction of segmental duplications after chromosome ii   <cit> . the topology of the phylogenetic tree of osiqd genes suggests four pairs of paralogous genes that evolved by segmental duplication ; interestingly, three such pairs include iqd genes located on chromosome i and v . like the iqd protein family in arabidopsis, the phylogenetic analysis of the rice gene family reveals four major subfamilies, and one can be divided into two subgroups. the two rice proteins containing the iq <dig> domain at their c-terminus cluster as a separate subfamily .

comparative phylogenetic analyses
we further investigated the relationship between the arabidopsis and rice iqd protein families by generating an alignment of the  <dig> identified iqd amino acid sequences followed by the generation of a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree . the combined phylogeny between the arabidopsis and rice iqd sequences revealed six subfamilies of putative orthologous genes. within each subfamily, the rice and arabidopsis genes appear more closely related to each other than to iqd genes of the same species in a different subfamily, suggesting that an ancestral set of iqd genes already existed before the monocot-eudicot divergence. four subfamilies of likely orthologous genes  are composed of nearly identical sets of genes that constitute the respective subfamilies in arabidopsis and rice . the remaining two subfamilies contain the genes encoding atypical iqd proteins in both species: at3g <dig>  os03m <dig> and os04m <dig>  are members of subfamily v, whereas at5g <dig> and os06m <dig>  comprise subfamily vi . the two genes coding for the acidic and unusually large iqd proteins, at1g <dig> and os04m <dig> , are members of subfamily iv and form a pair of orthologous genes. these subgroups of orthologous genes and other branches within the subfamilies are well-supported, which may be indicative for a relatively early diversification of iqd gene structure and function during plant evolution. the three genes that experienced loss of the conserved intron separating the iq <dig> domain-encoding exons, at5g <dig>  os01m <dig> and os08m <dig>  are members of different subfamilies , which suggests that intron loss occurred after the divergence of both evolutionary lineages. the phylogeny of arabidopsis and rice iqd genes supports the occurrence of species-specific iqd gene duplications events. for example the two closely related iqd gene pairs in subfamily i  or subfamily iv  result from duplication events that occurred independently in both species.

to explore the evolutionary history of the iqd gene family in greater detail, we searched publicly available genomic and est databases for homologous sequences in other plant species. we identified ests corresponding to iqd proteins for all angiosperm species represented in the tigr plant gene indices as well as for the gymnosperm pinus ssp. . as expected, the putative full-length iqd proteins of pine  are very similar to the arabidopsis and rice iqd proteins with respect to calculated molecular masses , isoelectric points  and frequencies of ala, ser, arg, and lys residues. a combined phylogenetic analysis of the arabidopsis, rice and pine full-length iqd protein sequences reveals that the iqd proteins from pinus cluster with different subfamilies , suggesting that iqd proteins predated the evolution of vascular plants. we also performed a blast search of the moss database  and identified one contig est sequence from physcomitrella patens that encodes an iqd-like protein . although the deduced amino acid sequence appears to be truncated at the c-terminus , an appreciable similarity with the protein encoded by at1g <dig> is evident , which includes the presence of meme motif  <dig> at its n-terminus . interestingly, alignment of the deduced iq <dig> domain of the moss polypeptide reveals a deletion of six residues that correspond to the n-terminus of the second iq <dig> domain-encoding exon of most arabidopsis and rice iqd proteins . as the iq <dig> intron is in phase- <dig>  and since a. thaliana and o. sativa both express an iqd-like gene in which the second iq <dig> domain-encoding exon is replaced by an unrelated exon, it is unlikely that the contig <dig> dna sequence is an artifact and probably represents either a novel variant of iqd-like genes or an ancestral gene of the iqd genes found in vascular plants.

we finally examined the relationships between the iq <dig> domains of the four plant species by constructing a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree using the paup* <dig>  program and the amino acid sequence alignment shown in figure  <dig>  three major subfamilies of iq <dig> domain sequences can be observed, which each contain members of the arabidopsis, rice and pine iqd families. in addition, two small subfamilies and two single branches originate deeply in the unrooted tree and are only distantly related to the three major subfamilies, which can be further divided into subgroups . bootstrap analyses indicated that the deep nodes of the tree have low statistical support, which may be attributed to the small size of the iq <dig> domain. low bootstrap support has also been observed for the phylogeny of the similarly sized dna-binding domains of bhlh  <cit> , dof  <cit> , or gata  <cit>  transcription factor families. nevertheless, the iq <dig> tree has better resolution in the outer clades. the short branches at the tips of the tree indicate high sequence conservation and strong evolutionary relationships among subfamily members. interestingly, although the major subfamilies of iq <dig> domain sequences  and of iqd full-length protein sequences  overlap only partially , subgroups of iq <dig> domain sequences largely correspond to subgroups of full-length iqd protein sequences as identified in figure  <dig>  which is suggestive of exon shuffling during the evolution of iqd proteins. we also investigated the effect of different programs and methods on iq <dig> domain tree topology. using clustalx and the neighbor-joining algorithm or the paup* <dig>  program and maximum parsimony analysis resulted in a similar tree topology , which indicates that the neighbor-joining tree presented in figure  <dig> is robust and reflective of likely phylogenetic relationships between iq <dig> domains within subfamilies.

discussion
the iq <dig> domain – a plant-specific arrangement of putative calmodulin-interacting motifs
in this study we characterized a possibly complete set of iq <dig> domain-encoding genes in the current version of the arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa genomes. the defining features of the iq <dig> domain are the invariant arrangement of three iq motifs  <cit>  separated by  <dig> and  <dig> intervening amino acid residues, and the conserved exon-intron organization . a pattern search of the arabidopsis proteome with the conventional iq motif  and its more generalized versions  as the queries confirmed a set of  <dig> iqd genes identified by reiterative blast searches. as expected from previous reports, our pattern search evidenced three additional major families and numerous miscellaneous proteins that contain at least one iq motif: the cngc family of cyclic nucleotide gated channels , the myosin family , and the camta family of calmodulin-binding transcriptional activators . for each of these families, the spacing of iq motifs and the exon-intron organization of the respective regions are unique and distinctive from the iqd family, which establishes the iqd proteins as a separate class of putative calmodulin targets of unknown biochemical functions . the iqd proteins possibly constitute the largest class of putative calmodulin targets in plants. the size of the iqd family in arabidopsis  and rice  clearly exceeds the size of other families of calmodulin-binding proteins  <cit>  and is only comparable with the cipk family  that interact with cbl ca2+ sensors in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . in addition to the iq motif, the iq <dig> domain contains multiple copies the 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig> motifs, which are related and typified by their spacing of hydrophobic and basic amino acid residues. while the iq motif is thought to mediate calmodulin retention in a ca2+-independent manner, the 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig> motifs are involved in ca2+-dependent association of calmodulin with its target  <cit> . however, it should be noted that not all characterized calmodulin-binding domains contain these features  <cit> .

we previously demonstrated that arabidopsis iqd <dig> binds to bovine calmodulin in a ca2+-dependent fashion  <cit> . in this study, we tested calmodulin binding for iqd <dig>  the smallest member of the arabidopsis iqd protein family , which consists only of the iq <dig> domain at its c-terminus and a short n-terminal extension of  <dig> amino acid residues. interestingly, we observed interaction of recombinant iqd <dig> with calmodulin in the absence of ca2+, which is possibly augmented when the metal ion is present . this observation and the prediction of putative calmodulin binding sites in iqd <dig> and all iqd proteins in arabidopsis and rice, using the algorithm provided by the calmodulin target database  <cit> , strongly suggest that all iqd proteins have the potential to interact with calmodulin . given our results with arabidopsis iqd <dig> and iqd <dig>  the prospect arises that different iqd proteins may interact with calmodulin in different modes, which could be ca2+-independent, ca2+-dependent, or more complex. the precise mechanism for each iqd protein is likely determined by the number and specific composition of the iq, 1-5- <dig> and 1-8- <dig> motifs in the iq <dig> domain, by the predicted calmodulin binding site adjacent to or overlapping with the iq <dig> domain, and by the overall tertiary structure of the iqd protein. these structural features differ substantially between iqd <dig> and iqd <dig> , which are likely responsible for the observed differences in calmodulin interaction with respect to ca2+ dependency. the identification of interacting calmodulin or calmodulin-like proteins  <cit>  and the biochemical characterization of calmodulin binding sites for each iqd protein are important tasks for future research.

it is interesting to note that the calmodulin target database successfully predicts experimentally verified calmodulin-interacting peptides in cngc  <cit>  and camta  <cit>  proteins, which are located at conserved positions adjacent to the iq motifs . although the iq motif is likely as widely distributed as calmodulin and calmodulin-like proteins, the iq67-specific arrangement of the three calmodulin retention motifs is confined to plant proteins and not found outside the plant kingdom, suggesting that this calmodulin-interaction module arose early in plant evolution.

evolution of iqd proteins
the presence of at least one putative iqd-like gene in physcomitrella patens indicates that the iqd gene family originated during the early evolution of land plants, possibly before the divergence of bryophyte and vascular plant lineages 450– <dig> myr ago  <cit> , but not later than the split of gymnosperms and angiosperms about  <dig> myr ago  <cit>  as evidenced by est and full-length cdna sequences coding for at least nine iqd genes in pine. molecular and phylogenetic analysis of iqd and iqd-like genes from ferns, bryophytes and green algae will be necessary to resolve the evolutionary origin of the iqd gene family.

to explore how the iqd gene family has evolved since the monocot-eudicot divergence 170– <dig> myr ago  <cit> , we performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of the iqd gene complement between arabidopsis and rice. the phylogenetic trees of the  <dig> arabidopsis and  <dig> rice iqd genes showed relatively long branches and closely clustered nodes, reflecting a high degree of sequence divergence, which is further indicated by the large variation in the number of protein-coding exons  and computed molecular masses of the predicted iqd proteins . based on their phylogenetic relationships, up to six different subfamilies of iqd genes can be defined for both species. this classification is supported by conserved exon-intron organization and protein motif patterns within each subfamily. the combined phylogenetic analysis revealed that members of all six subfamilies are present in the arabidopsis and rice genome, indicating a relatively early diversification of the iqd gene family before the monocot-eudicot split . in those subfamilies, seven members of both iqd gene families are clearly recognizable as distinct orthologous pairs , suggesting that the encoded proteins exert similar functions in both species. on the other hand, it is currently impossible to assign potential functions to iqd genes that are the result of recent species-specific duplication events leading to independent functional diversification.

the topology of the phylogenetic trees at the outer branches suggests that gene duplication played a prominent role in the evolution of both gene families, which is supported by the analysis of duplicated segments in the arabidopsis genome . more than 80% of all genes in the annotated arabidopsis genome reside in duplicated segments, and systematic analyses indicate that the arabidopsis genome experienced a large-scale or even complete genome duplication event 30– <dig> myr ago, sometime between the arabidopsis-gossypium and arabidopsis-brassica splits  <cit> . evidence for older  large scale-duplications exist, however, the frequency and precise timing of polyploidizations remains to be resolved and is a focus of current research  <cit> . the location of iqd genes in the arabidopsis genome is clearly reflective of the recent large-scale duplication event. the iqd gene family is uniformly distributed among the five chromosomes, and  <dig>  of the  <dig> iqd loci are found in duplicated segments of the recent age class . it is important to point out that  <dig> of those  <dig> genes in duplicated loci correspond to  <dig> iqd sister gene pairs, which represents an unusually high fraction of paralogous genes  that have been retained from the extra gene set since the duplication event. nonfunctionalization and subsequent gene loss is the most likely fate of a gene duplicate, and less than 27% of the entire paralogous gene set originating from polyploidy have been retained in arabidopsis  <cit> . preferential retention of duplicated genes has been observed for gene families in arabidopsis with functions in signal transduction and transcriptional regulation  <cit> . specific examples include the gene families encoding aux/iaa , gata  and gras  transcription factors, or genes coding for 20s proteasome subunits ; the given percentages equal fractions of retained gene duplicates that we calculated from published data. empirical evidence indicates that regulatory processes in metazoa such as signal transduction or gene transcription are dependent on gene dosage and stoichiometric protein-protein interactions  <cit> . as pointed out by blanc and wolfe  <cit> , retention of a near-complete set or subset of duplicated genes coding for regulatory components such as transcription factors, kinases, phosphatases or ca2+-binding proteins would minimize disturbances in sensitive stoichiometric and concentration-dependent relationships.

the evolutionary history of the rice genome is less understood. the view of an ancient polyploidy event has recently been questioned by evidence suggesting that rice experienced a partial or entire duplication of one chromosome about  <dig> myr ago and can thus be considered an ancient aneuploid  <cit> . the observed non-uniform distribution of the 29-member iqd gene family in the rice genome, 50% of all iqd loci and three of the four paralogous iqd gene pairs are present on chromosomes i and v , is more consistent with an aneuploidy than whole-genome duplication event. if polyploidization had occurred, it would be expected that iqd genes are randomly distributed over the whole rice genome, as observed for the iqd gene family in arabidopsis. given the significant differences in genome size and estimated gene count between rice  and arabidopsis , the slightly larger size of the iqd gene family in arabidopsis  versus rice  is in agreement with a whole-genome duplication event in the evolutionary history of the arabidopsis genome. a similar difference in membership has been reported for the arabidopsis and rice gene families encoding dof and gras transcription factors  <cit> . nonetheless, iqd genes tend to be larger in rice than in arabidopsis, which is mainly due to an increased intron length . in addition to polyploidization and segmental duplication events, tandem duplication is another important mechanism in the evolution of gene families  <cit>  and plays a significant role in arabidopsis as 17% of all genes are arranged in tandem arrays  <cit> . however, there is no evidence for tandem proliferation of the iqd gene families in the recent history of arabidopsis and rice genomes.

our analysis further suggests that exon shuffling played a major role during the evolution of iqd genes. exon insertions and duplications, the major mechanisms of exon shuffling, contributed significantly to the complexities of eukaryotic proteomes  <cit> . a striking correlation between functional domains in protein and exons flanked by introns of matching phases, referred to as symmetrical exons, has been observed  <cit> . as stated by the phase-compatibility rules of exon shuffling  <cit> , symmetrical exons and their flanking introns can be deleted, duplicated and inserted into introns of the same phase class without causing frame shifts. thus, symmetrical exons flanked by introns of a single phase class tend to predominate in genes that largely evolved by exon shuffling and their nonrandom usage may be indicative of gene assembly by exon recruitment  <cit> . an intriguing feature of iqd gene organization in arabidopsis and rice is the almost exclusive presence of symmetrical exons flanked by phase- <dig> introns . the strong bias for one intron phase class and the variation in the number of exons , and consequently size of the encoded proteins, is consistent with exon shuffling during the evolution of iqd genes. exon shuffling is also suggested by the comparisons of patterns of protein motifs  and by the phylogenetic analysis of iqd full-length proteins and iq <dig> domains, which indicate that phylogenetic relationships based on the iq <dig> domain do not necessarily recapitulate patterns of protein and gene structure . putative exon shuffling events may be recognized in some of the iqd gene structures. for example, at5g <dig> and os06m <dig> encode a partial iq <dig> domain and may have experienced exon swapping, or at4g <dig> may have acquired its penultimate exon when compared with at3g <dig> of the same subgroup . exon shuffling may have played a prominent role in the diversification of iqd genes and their hitherto unknown functions. the above-mentioned gene families of transcription factors  <cit>  contain introns of mixed phase classes, suggesting that exon shuffling played only a minor role during the evolution of these proteins with relatively defined functions. on the other hand, for example, all introns of genes coding for cipks are in phase- <dig>  <cit> . the exclusive usage of one phase class may indicate exon shuffling to generate the domain diversity necessary for kinase regulation and the ability to recognize a wide spectrum of protein substrates.

potential roles for iqd proteins
we have recently identified at3g <dig>  in a screen for arabidopsis mutants with altered glucosinolate accumulation  <cit> . glucosinolates are synthesized mainly by cruciferous species and constitute a class of secondary metabolites with roles in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores  <cit> . characterization of gain- and loss-of-function alleles of iqd <dig> demonstrated that the encoded protein functions as a modulator of glucosinolate pathway-related gene expression. tissue-specific expression of iqd <dig> is consistent with glucosinolate accumulation and mainly confined to the vascular tissues. we further demonstrated that an iqd1-gfp fusion protein is targeted to the cell nucleus and that recombinant iqd <dig> interacts with calmodulin in a ca2+-dependent fashion  <cit> . it is therefore intriguing to hypothesize that iqd <dig> integrates intracellular ca2+ signals elicited by environmental cues such as herbivorous attack to fine-tune glucosinolate synthesis and accumulation. it should be pointed out that the rice genome does not contain an ortholog of at3g <dig> , which is consistent with the absence of the glucosinolate pathway in this species and with functional diversification of the arabidopsis and rice iqd gene families.

we are left to speculate on the biochemical and cellular functions of iqd proteins. one of the most intriguing features of iqd proteins is their high isoelectric point , which has been maintained irrespective of protein size variation and domain composition, except for one family member each in arabidopsis and rice. this observation suggests that the basic nature of iqd proteins is important for their biochemical functions. although iqd proteins do not contain currently known dna- or rna-binding motifs, the basic isoelectric point and high frequency of serine residues, which are reminiscent of certain splicing factors  <cit> , suggest that iqd proteins may associate with nucleic acids and regulate gene expression at the transcriptional or post-transcriptional level. interestingly, we have recently observed that arabidopsis iqd <dig> binds to nucleic acids . a regulatory role for iqd proteins is also suggested by the relatively high fraction of retained duplicated iqd genes in the arabidopsis genome. preferential retention of paralogous gene pairs is thought to counteract disturbances in gene dosage and stoichiometric ratios of regulatory protein complexes after large-scale segmental duplication events and the onset of gene inactivation and loss of gene duplicates  <cit> . in this context, it is interesting to point out that the multiple ca2+-dependent and ca2+-independent calmodulin recruitment motifs of the iq <dig> domains are likely involved in specific and cooperative interactions with calmodulins or calmodulin-like proteins. these interactions may dramatically alter the dynamic range of ca2+-binding kinetics and, in turn, modulate interactions of the oligomeric protein complex with additional target proteins  <cit> . many, if not most, members of the arabidopsis and rice iqd protein families are likely to function in the cell nucleus . there is increasing evidence for the generation of nucleus-specific ca2+-signatures in plant cells  <cit>  and for a potential regulatory role of calmodulin and related ca2+ sensor proteins in nuclear processes such as transcription or gene silencing  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have systematically identified and characterized by bioinformatics a novel family of putative calmodulin target proteins in two model plant species, arabidopsis thaliana and oryza sativa. our phylogenetic analyses indicate that the major iqd gene lineages originated before the monocot-eudicot divergence and that the expansion of the iqd gene family in the genomes of arabidopsis and rice is consistent with a recent polyploidization and aneuploidization event, respectively. the extant iqd loci in arabidopsis primarily resulted from segmental duplication and reflect preferential retention of paralogous genes, which is characteristic for proteins with regulatory functions. the almost exclusive usage of phase- <dig> introns and variable number of exons suggests a role for exon shuffling during the diversification of iqd proteins, which is also supported by phylogenetic relationships between the iq <dig> domain and full-length iqd proteins. the unusually basic isoelectric point of iqd proteins and their frequently predicted nuclear localization suggest that iqd proteins link calcium signaling pathways to the regulation of gene expression. our study provides a framework for the functional dissections of this emerging family of putative calmodulin target proteins.
