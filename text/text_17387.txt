BACKGROUND
mouse disabled- <dig>  was isolated as a  <dig> kda phosphoprotein involved in csf- <dig> signaling in macrophages, and was initially referred to as p96
 <cit> . a fragment of the dab <dig> human cdna was also isolated based on its frequent loss of expression in ovarian cancer, and was termed doc- <dig> 
 <cit> . sequence homology suggests that the p <dig> protein is one of the two mammalian orthologs of the drosophila disabled gene
 <cit> ; hence, that was the origin of the naming for the neuronal expressed mammalian dab1
 <cit>  and the more ubiquitously expressed dab2
 <cit> .

the loss of expression of dab <dig> in ovarian cancer and growth regulatory properties in cell culture studies led to the suggestion that dab <dig> is a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer
 <cit> . subsequently, loss or reduction of dab <dig> expression was found in other cancer types including rat mammary tumors
 <cit> , breast cancer
 <cit> , colon cancer
 <cit> , esophageal cancer
 <cit> , urothelial carcinomas
 <cit> , prostate cancer
 <cit> , head and neck cancer
 <cit> , and nasopharyngeal carcinomas
 <cit> . mechanisms were also suggested for dab <dig> in epithelial organization
 <cit> , and in the regulation of ras/mapk
 <cit> , tgf beta
 <cit> , and wnt
 <cit>  signaling pathways.

cell biology studies revealed that dab <dig> is an endocytic adaptor protein
 <cit> . dab <dig> contains an n-terminal ptb domain that binds cell surface proteins with an npxy motif in their cytoplasmic tails
 <cit> ; several motifs that bind clathrin and adaptin proteins
 <cit> ; and a c-terminal region that binds myosin vi, a directional motor protein
 <cit> . thus, dab <dig> mediates the simultaneous attachment of clathrin-coated cargos containing transmembrane proteins with one or more npxy motifs, such as the low density lipoprotein  receptor, megalin, and integrins, to the myosin motor, enabling endocytosis and directional trafficking. a role of dab <dig> in endocytosis and trafficking of integrins and thus cell mobility has also been suggested
 <cit> . modulation of ldl receptor endocytosis by dab <dig> has also been studied in cultured cells
 <cit> , though a role in vivo has not yet been established. the polarized trafficking of cell adhesion molecules such as integrins and e-cadherin may explain the role of dab <dig> in epithelial polarity and organization
 <cit>  and trafficking of signaling surface receptors may account for its activity in modulating multiple signaling pathways
 <cit> .

to determine if any of these cellular mechanisms may be biologically relevant and significant, gene deletions in mice have been performed
 <cit> . a gene replacement of dab <dig> allele by betagal-neo led to the finding of early embryonic lethality in the knockout mice
 <cit> . in the mutants, extraembryonic endoderm cells intermixed with ectodermal cells in the e <dig>  embryos, and a visceral endoderm layer failed to develop
 <cit> . the aged heterozygous mice were found to develop ovarian cysts and preneoplastic lesions in both ovaries and uteri
 <cit> . a flox dab <dig> mutation was made and the homozygous deleted mutant mice were also embryonic lethal, but the mutant embryos were found to persist to a later stage
 <cit> . additionally, a mosaic dab <dig> deletion using a meox2-cre line was found to produce remarkably normal mice with minor defects in kidney function
 <cit> .

one possibility to explain the discrepancy between these two dab <dig> mutant lines is that the expression of betagal-neo in the dab <dig> mutant embryos
 <cit>  might lead a more severe phenotype. another idea is that the dab <dig> flox mutant allele
 <cit>  may produce truncated proteins from an alternative translation start site. hence, the later knockouts may not be complete nulls and the mutant embryos may be able to persist longer.

to investigate the differences in the two knockouts and to study further the relevant biological functions and possible tumor suppressor role of dab <dig>  we have designed another flox dab <dig> mutant allele with a more extensive exon deletion, produced the constitutive and conditional mutant mice, and examined the phenotypes. here, we report a detailed characterization of the embryonic phenotypes, the conditional knockout mice, the mutant embryonic stem cells, and the embryoid bodies.

RESULTS
construction of floxed dab <dig> mutant allele and mice
to investigate further the biological roles of dab <dig> in vivo and resolve the discrepancy in the embryonic phenotypes, we designed a new dab <dig> mutant using a cre/loxp strategy. the previously reported dab <dig> conditional knockout
 <cit>  was designed to delete only exon  <dig>  resulting in a frame-shift mutant protein. however, exon  <dig> contains an in-frame methionine codon that may serve as an alternative translational start site and produce a truncated dab <dig> mutant protein. a homologous targeting construct was prepared with loxp sites flanking both exons  <dig> and  <dig> to avoid the generation of alternative translational products .

upon transfection of es cells with the linearized targeting construct and g <dig> selection,  <dig> independent drug-resistant clones were picked and screened for homologous recombination by pcr . a total of  <dig> clones were identified as potentially homologous targeted lines, and  <dig> of the clones were characterized by pcr as containing the complete targeting construct and correct homologous replacement at both 5’ and 3’ ends . these two lines of es cells were used for blastocyst injections, chimeric mouse production, germ-line transmission, and establishment of the mutant colonies. the neo locus was then removed by crossing with flper mice
 <cit>  . the two lines of the conditional mutant mice were bred to homozygous dab <dig> flox, and the transmission of dab <dig> , , and  followed a mendelian ratio . homozygous flox mice exhibited wildtype characteristics with normal dab <dig> expression, reproductive capability, and lifespan. we conclude that the flox alleles do not influence dab <dig> gene activity and the flox mice are essentially wildtype, and the two dab <dig> mutant lines are identical.

characterization of dab <dig> constitutive null mutant embryos
the dab <dig> flox mice were crossed with meox2-cre transgenics
 <cit>  to delete the dab <dig> gene to generate delta flox  . here, we refer to the dab2-deleted allele in mosaic mice as “df” and constitutive null in germ-line deletion as “-”. next, we selected both male and female progenies with the dab <dig>  genotype for further matings to investigate the embryonic phenotype of dab <dig> constitutive knockouts, referred to as dab <dig> .

we initially examined embryos at e <dig>  when dab <dig> is expressed in the primitive endoderm
 <cit> . at this implantation stage, dab <dig>  embryos were identified by immunostaining for the absence of dab <dig> protein . in wildtype or heterozygous blastocysts, the gata4-, gata6-, and dab2-positive primitive endoderm cells exclusively located on the surface layer covering the oct3/4-positive inner cell mass. among  <dig> e <dig>  embryos found following sectioning of  <dig> uteri,  <dig> implanted blastocysts were confirmed as dab2-null based on immunostaining. in the dab <dig> knockout embryos, although gata4- and gata6-positive primitive endoderm cells were present, the cells were not organized into a monolayer epithelium and some located deep inside the inner cell mass . thus the embryonic defect is initiated at e <dig> , post differentiation but prior to morphogenesis of the primitive endoderm, although the phenotype is subtle at this stage.

by e <dig> , the disorganization of the extraembryonic tissues derived from the primitive endoderm was apparent . for comparison, all the dab2-positive e <dig>  embryos, of either dab <dig>  or , were well structured with a gata4- and dab2-positive ring of visceral endoderm surrounding the epiblast . a thin layer of parietal endoderm was present at the outer layer . of the  <dig> e <dig>  embryos sectioned and analyzed,  <dig> were dab2-positive , and  <dig> were confirmed as null. in the dab2-negative e <dig>  embryos, gata4-positive endoderm cells were misplaced and intermixed within the egg cylinder core in all mutant embryos analyzed , as shown in the  <dig> representative examples of sections through the center of the embryos. unlike wildtype embryos that had uniformly well patterned endoderm epithelium, all mutant embryos showed a spectrum in the degree of endoderm disorganization ranging from mild to severe .

since the previously reported dab <dig> mutant embryos persisted and defective embryos were observed at e <dig> 
 <cit> , we set up timed matings to genotype embryos specifically at e <dig>  for both dab <dig> mutant lines. no dissected embryos were determined as dab <dig>  in  <dig> timed matings . however, a significant number of reabsorbed embryos, which are likely homozygous mutants, were observed. thus, we conclude that the current dab <dig> mutant embryos exhibit embryonic lethality at around e <dig>  and no embryos can survive to e <dig> , consistent with the embryonic phenotype reported for the betagal-neo mutant
 <cit> . for e <dig>  to e <dig> , we observed putative mutant embryos in a various states of degeneration and re-absorption, which we found to be uninformative and have not systematically characterized them.
dab <dig> 
constitutive mutant embryos recovered at e <dig> 

note: e <dig>  embryos from matings between two lines  of dab <dig> mutant mice of dab <dig>  parents were genotyped by pcr. in total, embryos harvested from <dig> pregnant females were analyzed. the number of reabsorbed embryos was noted by visual examination of the uteri.

characterization of dab <dig> conditional mutant mice
we further examined the dab <dig> floxed mice using meox2-cre to bypass the essential function of dab <dig> in extraembryonic endoderm. cre expression initiates in the epiblast but is absent in extraembryonic tissues
 <cit> . we generated the conditional mutants by crossing female dab <dig>  with male dab <dig> ;meox2-cre mice. thus, the resulting dab <dig> ;meox2-cre mice were expected to be mosaic for deletion of dab <dig> in the embryo proper. mice genotyped as dab <dig> ;meox2-cre were produced and exhibited no detectable developmental defects. pcr genotyping of the tail tissues indicated that 90% of the floxed alleles were deleted, detected as “df”, and only 10% of the dab <dig> alleles remained intact as “fl” at around  <dig> weeks of age . dab <dig> is highly expressed in kidney
 <cit> , and immunostaining indicated kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells were evenly positive . however, in the adult conditional knockout mice , dab <dig> protein was lost in 90% or more of the cells . thus, when meox2-cre is used for gene deletion, substantial numbers of non-recombined cells nevertheless persist in adult mutant mice.

subsequently, we used another cre line, the sox2-cre transgenic
 <cit> , in an attempt to delete dab <dig> to a greater extent. like meox <dig>  sox <dig> is expressed in the epiblast but not in extraembryonic tissues, and sox2-cre line can efficiently delete the floxed gene in the embryo proper
 <cit> . the conditional mutants were generated by crossing female dab <dig>  with male dab <dig> ;sox2-cre mice. here, male rather than female carriers of sox2-cre were used to avoid a maternal effect, which, due to cre expression in oocytes, causes non-mendelian transmission
 <cit> . we found that the dab <dig> “fl” allele was consistently undetectable by pcr in tails of conditional knockouts at  <dig> weeks of age . comparisons of representative pcr amplifications from heterozygous, conditional knockouts using sox2-cre or meox2-cre, respectively, are shown . the kidney from adult sox2-cre conditional knockouts lacked any dab2-positive cells . nevertheless, dab <dig> ;sox2-cre mice were produced at a mendelian ratio and were devoid of any obvious developmental defects. both male and female mutant mice were fertile and had normal breeding ability when paired with a wildtype partner .

to address the possibility that a minor fraction of residual dab2-positive cells might be involved and critical for embryonic development and organogenesis, we assessed the potential presence of dab2-positive cells in early embryos of sox2-cre-mediated conditional dab <dig> knockout. female dab <dig>  were crossed with male dab <dig> ;sox2-cre mice to obtain e <dig>  embryos in which the embryonic  and extraembryonic  tissues were dissected, discretely separated, and used for pcr genotyping . in each embryo inheriting sox2-cre , significant levels of the “fl” allele were present in the extraembryonic compartments but the allele was undetectable in the embryo proper . an identical conclusion was reached from analysis of the sox2-cre-mediated embryonic and extraembryonic dab <dig> gene deletion at e <dig>  . thus, the efficiency of dab <dig> gene deletion by sox2-cre was high, and essentially 100% in embryonic cells by e <dig> . therefore, dab <dig> is dispensable for tissue formation and organogenesis within the embryo proper.

up to now, we have characterized more than  <dig> progenies with a dab2-deleted genotype and have observed no obvious developmental phenotype. however, the aged mice exhibited an increased incidence of preneoplastic lesions, mainly in the uterus, ovary, mammary gland, and colon, similar to the previous report for the dab <dig> heterozygous mice
 <cit> . the studies of the tumor phenotypes of aged dab <dig> knockout mice and in combination with p <dig> mutation will be reported elsewhere.

role of dab <dig> in cholesterol metabolism in vivo
we made additional attempts to determine possible physiological phenotypes of the dab2-deficient mice based on known cellular functions of the dab <dig> protein. dab <dig> is an endocytic adaptor protein for several npxy motif-containing cell surface receptors, including lipoprotein  receptor, megalin, and integrins. endocytosis of megalin mediated by dab <dig> is thought to play a role in protein re-uptake in the proximal tubule cells of kidney, and previously it was found that excessive proteins were present in the urine from dab2-deficient mice
 <cit> . a mild proteinuria phenotype was also observed in the dab2-deficient ;sox2-cre) mice in our current study.

in cultured cells, dab <dig> co-localizes with the ldl receptor in clathrin-coated pits
 <cit>  and modulates ldl uptake
 <cit> . thus, we inquired about the possible role of dab <dig> in ldl uptake in vivo by comparing serum cholesterol levels between littermates of dab <dig> sufficient ;sox2-cre) and deficient ;sox2-cre) mice. serum total cholesterol level was slightly but consistently elevated in dab2-null over heterozygous mice . a small difference in serum cholesterol was found consistently in  <dig> independent assays using small  groups of mice over a period of several months. in a more deliberate effort to compare serum cholesterol in groups of control and mutant mice shown in figure 
 <dig>  we found the small increase to be statistically significant . dab <dig> deficiency influenced mainly the ldl level , and had little effect on circulating triacylglycerol, hdl, and vldl levels.

in our breeding scheme of using male dab <dig> ;sox2-cre and female dab <dig>  parents, no dab <dig> wildtype littermates were generated to be used as controls. however, the serum lipid profiles of dab <dig>  mice were found identical to those of heterozygous and containing cre transgene ; sox2-cre), indicating there was no dosage effect of dab <dig> gene nor an impact of cre expression on cholesterol metabolism.

thus, the results support the findings from cell culture studies
 <cit>  that dab <dig> is involved in ldl receptor endocytosis and ldl uptake, and suggest that dab <dig> has a physiological role in cholesterol metabolism.

analysis of dab2-null embryoid bodies and embryos for adaptor proteins
we generated several lines of both dab <dig> heterozygous  and homozygous  mutant es cells from blastocysts for further study. previously, embryoid bodies derived from es cells in which dab <dig> expression was suppressed by shrna were defective in the organization of primitive endoderm layer
 <cit> . the ability of dab2-null es cells to form embryoid bodies was tested. in several dab <dig> mutant clones analyzed, primitive endoderm differentiation occurred, but the gata4-positive endoderm cells failed to form an epithelial layer on the surface of the embryoid bodies . in heterozygous and wildtype controls, a layer of laminin-positive basement membrane was observed , indicating the formation of an epithelium. in dab2-negative embryoid bodies, the differentiated primitive endoderm cells were positive for laminin; however, neither an endoderm epithelium nor a basement membrane layer was evident .

nevertheless, phenotypic variations were observed among the five dab <dig>  es clones isolated. a clone of dab <dig>  es cells  was observed to have a mild positioning phenotype, in that some monolayer endoderm epithelial structures were observed in a portion of embryoid bodies derived from this clone . we suspect that additional endocytic adaptors with activity similar to dab <dig>  such as numb and arh
 <cit> , might be able to substitute for dab <dig> function and rescue the endoderm disorganization in a subset of dab <dig> mutant embryoid bodies. indeed, we found that numb and arh proteins were expressed in differentiated es cells in embryoid bodies, and the expression varied among clones . compared to other es clones, the cells of the dab <dig>  clone dfg <dig> had higher arh and numb expression. additionally, expression of arh and numb appeared to change with passage in culture. thus, the compensatory expression of numb and/or arh may rescue primitive endoderm disorganization in embryoid bodies to some degree when dab <dig> gene is deleted. future experiments using combinative deletions or forced overexpression of the adaptors will be needed to test this possibility.

we further determined if compensatory expression of arh and numb adaptor proteins occurred in dab <dig> knockout embryos. e <dig>  embryos from matings between female dab <dig>  and male dab <dig> ;sox2-cre were harvested, and the entire embryo propers dissected free of extraembryonic tissues were analyzed by western blotting . although some variation in levels of numb and arh expression were visible in dab <dig> heterozygous e <dig>  embryos, global expression of numb and arh proteins was consistently elevated in the four dab2-deleted embryos analyzed , suggesting there was compensatory expression of arh and numb in the absence of dab <dig> during embryonic development. dab <dig>  the other drosophila disabled ortholog, was undetectable in es cells or e <dig>  embryos, either wildtype or mutant. involved in neuronal migration and with a brain-restricted expression
 <cit> , dab <dig> likely has little function or expression overlap with dab <dig> 

discussion
the current dab2-conditional deletion mouse model has verified the critical role of dab <dig> in the organization of the primitive endoderm
 <cit> . however, normal development following its deletion in the embryo proper indicates that the previously suggested roles of dab <dig> in the regulation of signaling pathways in unchallenged physiological situations are either very subtle or redundant in vivo.

mechanism of epithelial organization and the embryonic lethal phenotype of dab <dig> knockout mice
the current study confirms the previous observations that dab <dig> deficiency leads to disorganization of the extraembryonic endoderm
 <cit> . moreover, we observed primitive endoderm disorganization at e <dig> , a stage that immediately follows blastocyst implantation. the extraembryonic endoderm cells are present in dab2-deficient embryos, but intermingled with the epiblast cells instead of forming a surface epithelial layer. this phenotype of dab2-deficient embryos prompts us to describe dab <dig> as an “epithelial surface positioning gene”
 <cit> , in parallel to the manner in which dab <dig> is referred to as a “neuronal positioning gene”
 <cit> . the proposed mechanism is that dab <dig> mediates directional endocytic transport in the endoderm epithelial cells, leading to the establishment of an apical polarity
 <cit> . previously, it was considered that the highly adhesive embryonic cells sort to inside and less adhesive cells sort to the periphery
 <cit> , according to the differential adhesion hypothesis
 <cit> . however, in the case of the mouse primitive endoderm, the ability to establish apical polarity rather than differential adhesive affinity determines the anchoring of the primitive endoderm layer at the surface
 <cit> . thus, deletion of dab <dig> leads to the loss or reduced trafficking of cell surface adhesion molecules, consequently a reduced ability to establish a polarity, and finally the failure of primitive endoderm cells to position at the surface
 <cit> .

additionally, deletion of c-fos can partially rescue endoderm disorganization in the dab2-deficient embryos
 <cit> . dab <dig> can negatively modulate c-fos expression
 <cit> , and c-fos can regulate epithelial polarity
 <cit> . thus, dab <dig> may also impact endoderm cell organization through its influence on the mapk/c-fos signaling pathway. although, it was reasoned previously that additional activities of dab <dig> other than suppression c-for might impact organogenesis
 <cit> , the current result indicates dab <dig> developmental requirement is restricted to extraembrynic endoderm. however, it is still possible that dab <dig> expression within extraembryonic endoderm may influence embryonic development by a non-cell autonomous mechanism.

lack of developmental phenotypes in dab <dig> mosaic mutant mice
considering that the loss of dab <dig> in primitive endoderm leads to the disruption of epithelial organization and a severe phenotype in early embryos, we were perplexed that dab <dig> conditional knockouts generated using either meox2-cre or sox2-cre showed no developmental defects and had relatively mild adult phenotypes. one possibility is that remnant dab2-positive cells in the mosaic dab <dig> mutant mice are sufficient for essential developmental functions. alternatively, expression of endocytic adaptor proteins such as numb and arh, which have similar structures and functions as dab2
 <cit> , may compensate when dab <dig> is deleted. based on pcr genotyping of tail tissues and immunostaining of kidney, we estimated that around 5-10% of the cells still contain undeleted dab <dig> gene in meox2-cre conditional knockout. conversely, the “fl” allele was undetectable in sox2-cre knockout lines, yet the percentage of dab2-positive cells could be higher in the earlier stages of embryonic development. sox <dig> is expressed in and essential for the trophoblast extraembryonic lineage
 <cit> . however, sox2-cre-mediated deletion of dab <dig> gene did not affect trophectoderm development, thus dab <dig> is also not essential in at least a subset of the trophoblast lineage. although the dab <dig> gene can be deleted in the majority of somatic cells without affecting embryonic development, we considered the possibility that a miniscule fraction of dab2-positive cells may be sufficient to fulfill its potentially critical roles. nevertheless, we did not detect any remaining dab <dig> allele in e <dig>  sox2-cre conditional knockout embryos. most likely, compensatory expression of dab2-like proteins such as arh and numb accounted for a mild phenotype and the actual formation of primitive endoderm structures observed in some of the dab2-deficient embryoid bodies.

dab <dig> mediates endocytosis and contributes to lipoprotein metabolism in vivo
although dab2-deficient mice were overtly normal, mutant mice did have several physiological differences, such as excessive excretion of plasma proteins in urine and increased serum cholesterol and ldl. these physiological phenotypes might be attributable to the adaptor activity of dab <dig> for megalin and ldl receptor, respectively. another well-documented dab <dig> binding ligand is integrin
 <cit> . though an impact of dab <dig> on cell migration was observed in cultured cells, we found no related physiological phenotype in the mutant mice. dab <dig> also has been reported to have many other activities, but these phenotypes were also not readily observable in the mutant mice.

in the case of ldl receptor endocytosis, the increased cholesterol and low density lipoprotein levels in dab <dig> deficient mice was small but readily detectable. the increased serum cholesterol and ldl levels was likely due to the absence of dab <dig> protein in mediating uptake of ldl particles from circulation by dab2-mediated endocytosis. the results support the findings in cell culture studies
 <cit>  that dab <dig> is involved in ldl receptor endocytosis and ldl uptake, and suggest that dab <dig> has a physiological role in cholesterol metabolism. normally, mice have a relatively low level of serum ldl. possibly, the difference in serum cholesterol and ldl levels would be more significant in dab2-deficient mice when the animals are placed on a high fat diet. the impact of dab <dig> on cholesterol metabolism, the cell types affected, and comparison with ldl receptor and arh mutant mice, will be interesting topics of future investigations.

likely, as an endocytic adaptor for several cell surface receptors, dab <dig> may influence the endocytosis and secretion of multiple ligands, and may regulate multiple signaling pathways. the function of dab <dig> is pleiotropic, although it may serve as a fine tune regulator of signaling and an endocytic adaptor with overlapping specificity with other adaptors, but the impact of its deletion is mild when observed in normal physiological setting. however, additional phenotypes and dab <dig> functions may be observed in deeper analysis of the dab <dig> deficient mice, and also when placing the mutant mice in a challenged situation.

cellular actions of dab <dig> in signaling and cell adhesion
dab <dig> has been implicated in regulating signaling pathways, including the ras/mapk/c-fos
 <cit> , the tgf-beta
 <cit> , and the wnt pathways
 <cit> . dab <dig> also participates in the endocytic recycling of e-cadherin
 <cit>  and integrins
 <cit>  and thereby influences cell adhesion and mobility. it is plausible that dab <dig> affects these diverse cellular signaling pathways due to its role in endocytosis and trafficking; however, whether these activities are physiologically significant has not been resolved previously. the ras/mapk pathway
 <cit> , the tgf-beta pathway
 <cit> , the wnt pathway
 <cit> , e-cadherin
 <cit> , and integrins
 <cit>  are all critical in embryonic development and their perturbations impair the process. since dab <dig> deletion in the embryo proper minimally impacts embryonic development, we would argue that the majority of the proposed dab <dig> functions generated from these in vitro studies have little relevance in vivo. dab <dig> may fine-tune the activities of these signaling pathways, but the effects are subtle and not readily observable in the normal physiology of whole animals.

loss of dab <dig> in epithelial disorganization and cancer
one common observation in both early embryonic development and carcinogenesis is that loss of dab <dig> leads to epithelial morphological transformation. the loss of dab <dig> correlates well with morphological changes, specifically the transition from a simple epithelial monolayer to a multiple layered neoplasm in ovarian cancer
 <cit> . this is remarkably reminiscent of the disorganization and loss of surface position of primitive endoderm in dab2-deficient embryos and embryoid bodies. dab2-mediated directional endocytic trafficking leads to the generation of an apical-basal epithelial polarity, and polarity plays critical role in surface positioning
 <cit> . thus, loss of dab <dig> results in epithelial depolarization and subsequent disorganization, as found in ovarian carcinomas and early embryos
 <cit> . however, ovarian surface epithelia are monolayered and intact in dab2-deficient mice , indicating the loss of dab <dig> alone is insufficient to induce epithelial disorganization. unlike the primitive endoderm epithelium in rapidly growing embryos, mature epithelia in adults most likely possess additional mechanisms to ensure stable architecture.

CONCLUSIONS
the current results in the study of a new dab <dig> conditional mutant allele are consistent with the prior report that dab <dig> deletion leads to an early embryonic lethality at e <dig> 
 <cit> . this lethality occurs much earlier than the other report of mutants derived from a previously reported conditional allele
 <cit> . consistent with our prior
