BACKGROUND
introduction
repeat sequences are a common feature of genomes  <cit> . the detection and study of periodicity in genomic sequences has been an area of increasing interest. signal processing approaches to periodicity detection methods are attracting significant attention in genomic dna investigations of approximate repeats because they are rather robust in the presence of substitutions, insertions and deletions and may identify approximate periodicities in dna sequences. different computational techniques have been used: fourier spectral analysis  <cit> , wavelet transform  <cit> , dna walk analysis  <cit> , information theory measures  <cit> , informational decomposition  <cit> , quaternionic periodicity transform  <cit> , exactly periodic subspace decomposition  <cit> , portrait method  <cit> , enhance algorithm for distance frequency distribution  <cit> , etc.

discrete fourier transformation  based methods
spectral analysis employing discrete fourier transform is used to reveal periodicity in symbolic sequences, like genomic and protein sequences  <cit> , to investigate long-range correlations  <cit>  and to study the problem of sequence similarity  <cit> .

dft identification of approximate repeats
a peak at a frequency f in fourier power spectrum of base correlations of a given genomic sequence shows a kind of l = 1/f – base periodicity, exact or approximate  <cit> . in the ideal case of perfect periodicity, where a fragment of the length l is exactly repeated n times, periodicity generates a series of l- <dig> equidistant peaks in the power spectrum, at frequencies  <cit> :

 f <dig> = 1/l, f <dig> = 2/l, f <dig> = 3/l, ... fl- <dig> = /l 

approximate repeats, modified by random insertions and/or deletions with respect to perfect repeats, typical for genomic sequences of higher organisms, can often be identified using fourier transform  <cit> . this procedure results in a characteristic system of equidistant peaks. however, it was noted that a disadvantage of methods based on fourier transform may be that in cases of more pronounced deletions or insertions the periodicity cannot be detected, while deletions and insertions are frequent mutational events in genomic sequences  <cit> .

dft identification of period three hidden periodicity
a sharp peak of period three was found in a search for periodic regularities on a sample set of human exons  <cit> . the three-base periodicity in exons is caused by unbalanced nucleotide distributions in the three coding positions, while in intron sequences the nucleotides distribute uniformly. the relative height of the corresponding peak in fourier spectrum is a good discriminator of coding potential and has been used to detect coding regions  <cit> .

dft identification of long-range correlations
statistical studies of dna sequences have been instigated by finding of the 1/fβ long-range power-law correlations in human genomic sequences, indicating the presence of scale invariant structure  <cit> , implying that the underlying system shows fractal properties  <cit> . the lack of long enough sequences and the use of different methods of estimating the correlations, leading to some results not strictly comparable to each other contributed to controversies regarding findings on long-range correlations, like the presence of these correlations only in non-coding or in all human genomic sequences, and their presence in other organisms  <cit> . non-stationary analysis of dna sequences has shown that both coding and non-coding sequences exhibit long-range correlations, with the average spectral exponent of non-coding segments being higher than its counterpart for coding segments  <cit> . with the availability of large sequences and extended statistical computations, showing power-law correlations over four or five orders of magnitude, with exponents which are consistent with previous results obtained analyzing short sequences, such correlations in human dna, with fractal-like scaling, are now commonly accepted  <cit> . it has been pointed out that the mosaic structure of genome is presumably responsible for long-range correlations  <cit> . at very low frequencies  the power spectrum flattens out  <cit> . it should be noted that the attribution of long-rang correlations exclusively to large-scale variations of nucleotide density responsible for 1/fβ spectra is not quite correct. generally, even large-scale variations of nucleotide density may produce patterns different from 1/fβ spectra.

dft identification of alphoid higher order repeats 
here we investigate the application of fourier analysis to human alpha satellite tandem repeats and the associated higher order repeats . alphoid arrays consist of tandem repeats of alpha satellite monomer unit of approximately  <dig> bp, which form chromosome-specific higher order repeats  or monomeric organization consisting of diverged monomers  <cit> . alpha satellite monomers within hor exhibit substantial mutual sequence divergence , while hors exhibit much lower mutual divergence   <cit> . such a case is interesting for fourier analysis because it has a two-level hierarchy of approximate homology.

alpha satellite dna is characterized by many levels of hierarchical organization in genomes, from suprachromosomal families to chromosome-specific subsets, to polymorphic variation within these subsets  <cit> . the higher order repeat organization is consistent with linear sets of diverged monomers becoming the unit of crossing-over during the process of sequence homogenization. the hor units of alpha satellite monomers are organized in largely chromosome specific manner. the centromere of each human chromosome is characterized by one or more subsets of distinct alpha satellite hor units. analyses have revealed the presence of up to several thousand repeat units arranged in an apparently uninterrupted fashion in the centromere and forming arrays of several million base pairs. alpha satellite hors have been studied using restriction enzymes that cut higher order repeat unit  <cit> . recently, hors and monomeric alpha satellites have been studied by computational analysis of genomic sequences from the ncbi genome assembly  <cit> .

as a case study we consider a  <dig> mer hor at the loci d7z <dig> and d7z <dig> in human chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . in  <cit>   <dig> mers were identified by dotter analysis; the presence of  <dig> mer was reported, but detailed hor structure was not presented. in detailed computational studies of genomic sequence of the 193277-bp clone ac <dig>  , the  <dig> complete and  <dig> incomplete copies of  <dig> mer alphoid hor were identified in the central domain   <cit> . preliminary study of power spectra discussed the general pattern and the signal-to-noise ratio  <cit> . these hor copies are highly homologous , while divergence among monomers within each hor copy is sizeable .  such a long genomic sequence enables a highly precise determination of higher order periodicities. in the front domain of genomic sequence  and in the back domain ,  <dig> alpha satellite monomers are present which are not organized into hors and therefore are all mutually divergent by 20% or more. only 29% of this bordering domain is not of alpha satellite type.

our goal is to investigate the periodicities in the short-, medium-, and long-range order, related both to less homologous alphoid monomeric pattern and to more homologous alphoid higher-order repeats and to correlate the two levels of periodicity, primary  and secondary .

RESULTS
dft identification of hor in ac <dig>  based on quartic mapping
the genomic sequence ac <dig>   from chromosome  <dig> was transformed into numerical sequence using quartic mapping  with parameters  . the ac <dig>  sequence is used as a case study for the use of dft method for interplay of monomeric and hor repeats. in general, regions containing higher order repeat sequences can be located through the sliding window analysis, similarly as used in  <cit>  for primary periodicity sequences. analyzing complete nucleotide sequence we found domains having different repeat pattern, the central hor domain and the bordering domains , in accordance with identifications obtained using other methods  <cit> .

the low-frequency part f <  <dig>  bp- <dig> of the power spectrum of hor domain in ac <dig>  is displayed in figure 1a) and the power spectrum up to the frequency  <dig>  bp- <dig> in figure 1b). the computed power spectrum at low frequencies shows equidistant peaks at frequencies

 fn = n·f <dig>    n =  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  ... 

the fundamental frequency f <dig> corresponds to the 2734-bp hor. .

these equidistant peaks are identified over a very broad interval, up to n ≈  <dig>  in fact, all prominent peaks above the white noise background in the power spectrum are multiples of the fundamental frequency f <dig>  we note that such an extremely regular pattern can be rarely found even in the most regular dynamical systems in physics and engineering.

in addition to the standard spectral density sf  at frequency fn , we define an effective spectral density

 seff=sff1fn, 

renormalized in order to increase the relative weight of low-frequency with respect to high frequency peaks. the effective values seff corresponding to frequencies f <dig>  f <dig> = 2f <dig>  f <dig> = 6f <dig>  and f <dig> = 16f <dig> are  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively.

the prominent peak at the frequency f <dig> =  <dig>  bp- <dig> corresponds to approximately  <dig> bp length. more precisely, 1/f <dig> =  <dig>  bp. it corresponds to a set of alpha satellite monomers which constitute consensus hor . alternatively, the hor period 1/f <dig> =  <dig> bp could be also expressed as multiple of monomer period 1/f <dig> =  <dig> bp. the low-frequency peaks at f <dig>  f <dig>  ..., f <dig> are subharmonics of the monomer frequency f <dig> 

in the frequency region above the monomer frequency f <dig> , within the set of multiple frequencies nf <dig>  we find a prominent subset of higher harmonics at frequencies that are multiples of the monomer frequency f <dig> : 2f <dig> , 3f <dig>  4f <dig>  ... this subset with band head at the frequency f <dig> will be referred to as monomeric band.

fourier analysis works well enough for studying relatively short periodicities while the statistical significance of longer periodicities will be decreased by the presence of shorter periodicities  <cit> . thus, the statistical significance of longer periods was predicted to be a sort of smeared through statistical significance of shorter periods, i.e., for harmonics with longer periods the damping effect may be more pronounced  <cit> . we show here that the dft method is applicable to alphoid hors up to very long periodicities .

generally, the fundamental frequency for equidistant pattern in the power spectrum corresponds to the periodicity of highest order in a given sequence, i.e., to the period of hor . specifically, in the hor domain of ac <dig>  the fundamental frequency in power spectrum corresponds to the period of hor consensus unit,  <dig> bp.

although the hor copies are much more homologous to each other than the constituent alpha satellite monomers among themselves, the number of monomers corresponding to primary periodicity  is much higher than the number of hor copies corresponding to secondary periodicity , and therefore the peaks of primary periodicity have higher spectral strengths.

robustness of dft results for hierarchical structure of cascade of primary and secondary periodicities using different genomic into numerical sequence mapping
the difficulty with dft approach may be dependence on a particular labeling adopted. for example, some of the relevant harmonic structure can be hidden  by the symbolic-to-numeric mapping  <cit> . to check the required mapping invariance, we investigate whether the hierarchical periodic pattern shown in this paper is robust with respect to a particular choice of procedure for transforming symbolic to numerical sequence.

test computation for quartic mapping deduced from systematic of purine/pyrimidine and strong/weak bond characteristics
to test robustness of hierarchical structure obtained in figures 1a) and 1b), we have first computed the power spectrum of hor domain in ac <dig> , using the quartic mapping  with parameters   and 2b)). the quartic parametrization  was based on combined consideration of purine/pyrimidine and strong/weak characteristics of nucleotides  <cit> . up to an overall normalization, this spectrum is practically identical as obtained in the computation in figure  <dig>  this is understandable because of linear relation between mapping parameters  and .

test computation for quartic mapping deduced from reduced dimensionality of frequency spectrum in symmetric manner
a further test was performed using quartic mapping  with reduced dimensionality of the frequency spectrum representation from four to three with parameters – from  <cit> . the computed spectrum in figures 3a) and 3b) shows a similar pattern of hierarchy of primary and secondary periodicity peaks as in figure  <dig>  confirming robustness of the method.

test computation by summing the squares of fourier transforms of indicator sequences
finally, we test the robustness of hierarchical primary and secondary periodicity pattern by computing total power spectrum obtained by summing squares of fourier transform of indicator sequences . the resulting power spectrum in figure  <dig> shows a similar hierarchical pattern as in figure  <dig>  confirming robustness of the method.

hierarchical primary and secondary periodicity pattern in perfect hor sequence
the hor sequence from ac <dig>  in chromosome  <dig>  studied in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  is characterized by a low divergence among  <dig> hor copies in the sequence of only a few percent  <cit> . here we construct an exact hor sequence, with divergence among copies equal to zero, by forming a sequence of  <dig> identical hor copies, equal to the 2734-bp consensus hor corresponding to ac <dig>  in chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the resulting power spectrum  shows a much more pronounced hierarchical secondary periodicity pattern than obtained for realistic hor sequence in figure  <dig>  in this way analysis was extended to give some feel of how this perfect case appears when the periodicity is disrupted for a realistic genomic sequence.

robustness of power spectrum for hierarchical structure of cascade of primary and secondary periodicities for imperfect hors
in the next step we have investigated the robustness of the hierarchical periodicity pattern with an increase of imperfection in the hor sequence. this is shown by random insertion of increased length inserted into the hor sequence ac <dig> . power spectra are presented for: 10000-bp random insertion  and 6b)), 30000-bp random insertion  and 6d)), and 60000-bp random insertion  and 6f)). it is seen that the level of noise increases with increase of insertion length, but even in the case of 60000-bp random insertion  the hierarchical structure of primary and secondary periodicity can be identified  and 6f)).

noisy power spectrum of a random artificial sequence
in order to test that the hierarchical primary and secondary periodicity pattern is not a numerical artifact, we have computed the power spectrum corresponding to a random sequence generated by random number generator, having the same length as the hor sequence in ac <dig>  . computation is performed using quartic mapping with paramerization . from this power spectrum, shown in figure  <dig>  it is seen that the computational method does not generate hierarchical periodicity.

power spectrum pattern of monomeric alphoid domain in ac <dig> 
the low-frequency power spectrum  of combined front- and back-domains of ac <dig>  is displaced in figure 8a) and the higher-frequency section in figure 8b). a significant difference with respect to the central hor domain is seen in the low-frequency region : there are no prominent peaks below the frequency f <dig> . in the front- and back-domains there is no peak corresponding to  <dig> mer hor , as well as to the multiples of f1: f <dig> = 2f <dig>  f <dig> = 3f <dig>  ..., f <dig> = 15f <dig>  at frequencies below f <dig> which corresponds to the 171-bp monomer. in that case the frequency of the lowest peak in the power spectrum corresponds to the period  <dig> bp of consensus alpha monomer and the power spectrum contains only the monomeric band . this reveals that hor is absent in the front and back domains. a tandem of alpha satellite monomers, not organized into hors, is referred to as monomeric  <cit> . as seen from our results, the noise is stronger in monomeric domains  than in the central hor domain. on the other hand, the equidistant pattern associated with prominent peaks above the frequency f <dig> , for monomeric domain is rather similar as for hor domain .

absence of low-frequency 1/fβ-noise in dft power spectrum
the 1/fβ – noise is absent in the low-frequency region of power spectrum of ac <dig> , both in the central hor domain  and in the monomeric front- and back-domains . this result is in accordance with expectations, because the sequence mainly consists of approximate repeats, without sizeable sequence-wide base composition fluctuations. previously, some cases of absence of long range correlations in repeat sequences have been found. for example, in a sequence for beta globin on human chromosome  <dig>  two 6-kb segments without long-range correlations were identified, both including stretches of repetitive dna  <cit> .

the a+t fraction in the ac <dig>  sequence is almost constant along the sequence . using bins of  <dig> kb, the calculated fraction of a+t nucleotides is  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, with small fluctuations around the average value. this homogeneity of nucleotide density is in accordance with expectations that the 1/fβ noise is related to varying ratio of pyrimidines and purines, or other nucleotide combinations, at base positions along dna sequence  <cit> .

for comparison, to show that the dft power spectrum method used here identifies the low-frequency 1/fβ – noise, if present, we display the power spectrum computed for contig nt_ <dig>  from chromosome  <dig> . this contig of about  <dig> mb lies outside of centromeric region and is characterized by the presence of genes and absence of hors. the power spectrum computed using quartic mapping at parametrization  clearly shows the presence of low-frequency 1/fβ – noise.

rank ordering for harmonics in alpha monomeric spectrum
in the power spectrum of our case study for genomic sequence in hor domain the equidistant peaks corresponding to multiples of monomer frequency f <dig> are sizably stronger than the other peaks . among the low-frequency peaks in figure 1b) the most pronounced peaks are 10f <dig>  12f <dig>  and 14f <dig>  the corresponding lengths are approximately  <dig> bp,  <dig> bp, and  <dig> bp, respectively. the 14-bp length may be related to the highest frequency of appearance of the 6-bp key string ttttga at the distance of  <dig> bp between two neighboring key strings. however, in general, the chosen mapping may influence the rank ordering of harmonics, as seen by comparing their relative heights in figures  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  thus, the effect of parameter choice for symbolic-to-numeric transformation may overshadow the effect of hidden genomic substructure.

absence of periodicity three in power spectrum of hors
in previous investigations of fourier power spectra of coding dna sequences a major peak was found at the frequency f = 1/ <dig> bp- <dig>  related to the codon structure  <cit> . in the present case of a segment with entirely noncoding sequence, no peak appears at f = 1/ <dig> bp- <dig> . this is in accordance with previous conclusions that the period- <dig> feature is usually lacking or is weak in noncoding regions  <cit> . for comparison, using quartic mapping we computed the power spectrum of cds from the gene dnah <dig> in chromosome  <dig> . in this power spectrum obtained by computation using quartic mapping , at the frequency f = 1/ <dig> bp- <dig> a pronounced peak is present.

use of power spectrum for identification of hierarchical primary and secondary periodicity pattern in chromosome 1
the computation of power spectrum, shown here for the test case of  <dig> mer hor in chromosome  <dig>  can be extended for hor identification and study in other chromosomes as well. as an example, we present in figure  <dig> the power spectrum computed for contig nt_ <dig>  in chromosome  <dig>  using quartic mapping with parametrization . here we find a hierarchical pattern of primary and secondary periodicity .

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that dft is a robust and efficient method to identify alphoid hors in alpha satellite domain of genomic sequence. in the case of nmer hor the lowest peak is at the fundamental frequency 1/, which will be referred to as hor-frequency. it is a head of band of equidistant peaks at frequencies equal to consecutive multiples of hor-frequency, i.e., 1/, 2/, 3/, ... this band is referred to as the hor-band. some peaks within the hor-band form a strong-spectral-power subset with band head at monomer-frequency 1/. this subset forms a band of equidistant peaks at frequencies which are multiples of monomer-frequency 1/, i.e., it corresponds to the peaks at frequencies 1/, 2/, 3/, .... this sub-band is referred to as the monomeric-band.

in the case of monomeric alpha satellites  the lowest peak is at the monomer-frequency 1/. it is a head of monomeric-band built from peaks at frequencies 1/, 2/, 3/, ....

dft was applied here in the case study of genomic sequence ac <dig>   from centromeric region in human chromosome  <dig>  the central domain of ac <dig>  consists of 16-mer alphoid hor copies. thus the frequency of the lowest peak in the power spectrum  is 1/. we identified in the power spectrum as many as one thousand peaks at frequencies equal to multiples of hor-frequency, forming a hor-band. among these peaks in the hor-band a subset of peaks at frequencies 1/, 2/, 3/, .... is characterized by pronounced spectral power and represents the monomeric-band. this reveals hidden periodicities in the 171-bp monomer, i.e., a hierarchy of periodicities within the monomer sequence. power spectra of both the hor region and of the monomeric region show this pattern of hidden higher frequencies.

the case study shows that dft is robust in detecting approximate hors, even in the presence of substantial sequence insertions and deletions.

additionally, the applicability of dft method was shown for chromosome  <dig>  where a hierarchical pattern of  <dig> mer hor is present.

computing dft power spectra for anonymous genomic sequence using sliding windows for bins of about  <dig> kb and step size of about  <dig> kb provides an easily recognizable hierarchical two-level equidistant pattern in the power spectrum as signature of presence of hor and gives a simple method to determine the size of hor.
