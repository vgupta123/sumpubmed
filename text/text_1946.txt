BACKGROUND
proteolytic enzymes are multifunctional enzymes that have many physiological functions in plants and animals including germination, senescence, apoptosis, complement activation, inflammation process etc. and also having commercial importance in food, leather and textile industry. commercially they are extremely important as more than 60% of the total enzyme market is made up of proteases; they are isolated from plants, animals, bacteria and fungi. proteolytic enzymes from the plant sources have received special attention because of their broad substrate specificity as well active in wide range of ph, temperature, and in presence of organic compounds as well as other additives  <cit> . search for valuable proteases with distinct specificity is always a continuous challenge for varied industrial applications.

the mobilization of seed storage proteins represents one of the most important post-germination events in the growth and development of seedling. proteolytic enzymes play central role in the biochemical mechanism of germination and intricately involved in many aspects of plant physiology and development  <cit> . numerous reports including our previous data supported the proteases are responsible for protein degradation. the legume seeds contain albumin and globulin storage proteins; act as amino acid reserves which are mobilized to nourish the seedling. globulins belong to the vicillin and legumin family these are degraded by endoproteases particularly cysteine proteinase. in horse gram, during germination we observed the disappearance of high molecular weight  polypeptides of globulins and appearance of a new  <dig> kda polypeptide  <cit> . to study the mechanism of protein mobilization process, many have undertaken the task of purifying and characterizing a variety of proteases, some of which occur only transiently in germinating seeds  <cit> . with renewed interest, there has been proliferation of reports in the last decade concerning purification and characterization of these proteases from germinating leguminous and non-leguminous seeds  <cit> . exploration for existence of valuable proteases as well as understanding the appropriate physiological role of such proteases in plants is still an open area of investigation.

horse gram  verdc.) is one of the lesser known, unexploited legume of the tropics and subtropics grown under dry-land agriculture. in our previous studies the pattern of mobilization of seed storage proteins and activation of proteolytic enzymes  were investigated in germinating horse gram seeds  <cit> . in the present investigation we report the purification and biochemical characteristics of an endoprotease from the germinating seedlings of horse gram. it is shown that this protease is a cysteine protease  hitherto not known in the genus macrotyloma with novel cleavage specificities.

RESULTS
purification of protease
the cotyledons of day  <dig> germinating horse gram seeds were used for isolation of endoprotease, since the activity was maximal at this point during the four-day period of germination  <cit> . maximum yield of protease activity observed with  <dig>  m tris-hcl buffer ph  <dig> , containing  <dig> mm of β-me among other buffers  used. change in ph, alterations in molarity or omission of β-me in the extraction buffer substantially lowered the yield of the activity . the protease activity was measured by using the chromogenic substrate, azocasein. the results of the four step purification of cprhg were summarized in table  <dig>  the cprhg was initially precipitated with  ammonium sulphate and dialyzed and subjected to deae cellulose column. the bound enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient of kcl . the fractions  <cit>  contained 40% of enzyme activity with specific activity of  <dig>  were pooled and concentrated by ammonium sulphate . the final efficient step of purification is the fractionation on cm-sephacel. under provided conditions, 12% of the loaded enzyme was not adsorbed to the column and eluted, that was found to be homogeneous on 10% sds-page .

homogeneity and size of the purified enzyme
the purified cprhg was found to be homogeneous by the detection of a single polypeptide by sds-page which is further supported by single precipitin band on immunodiffusion of the crude extract . immunoblot analysis of the purified cprhg also conform the monoreactivity of the antiserum . the size of the purified cprhg was estimated to be  <dig>  k da on sephadex g- <dig> column and the same was also supported by sds-page . however, on isoelectrofocussing  two isoforms were observed with different pi values of  <dig>  and  <dig>  .

amino acid composition
the amino acid analysis of cprhg was shown relatively fewer numbers of histidines, sulfur containing amino acids  and higher number of aspartic acid , glutamic acid  and serine .

effect of ph, temperature, time and storage stability
effect of ph on cprhg was carried out using azocasein as substrate and found the enzyme was active at acidic ph optimum,  <dig>  with azocasein ,  <dig>  with hemoglobin and  <dig>  with gelatin and bsa . the activity was stable in the ph range  <dig> -  <dig>   and also observed gradual loss of activity outside this ph range. however, the temperature vs activity profile showed an increased activity with temperature and exhibited maximal activity at 40°c . the enzyme was fairly stable at 40°c  and also exhibits linear proteolytic activity up to  <dig> h at this temperature .

effect of metal ions, selective inhibitors and sulfhydryl reagents on cprhg
the protease activity was clearly inhibited at lower concentrations of zn2+, hg2+ and cu2+ . however, metal ions like ni2+, co2+and pb2+ were shown an inhibition on above  <dig> mm. mn2+ at higher concentrations  stimulated the activity. metal chelating agents such as  <dig>   <dig> phenanthroline and edta had no effect . the cprhg activity was neither inhibited by aspartyl modifying reagent  nor by serine modifying reagents . however, the activity was completely inhibited by sulfhydryl modifying reagents . we also observed the complete inhibition by histidyl modifying reagent . these results suggested that the cprhg is a cysteine protease, with cysteine and histidine residues at the active site . addition of sulfhydryl reagents  reverses the strong inhibition by pcmb .

immunoblotting of cpr hg development
the polyclonal anti-cprhg could recognize  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> k da polypeptides from crude extract of germinating cotyledons. presence of hmw  <dig> k da protein in the first  <dig> days of germination and disappeared by day  <dig>  the  <dig> k da polypeptide was noticed in the extracts from days 0- <dig>  the intensity of  <dig> k da endoprotease  in the cotyledons of germinating seeds increased up to day  <dig> and declined later. similar profile was also noticed for  <dig> k da polypeptides . these results revealed that the enzyme cprhg synthesized as zymogen  and processed to a  <dig> k da proenzyme and then to the  <dig> k da active enzyme which is further degraded to a  <dig> k da product.

discussion
maximum endoprotease activity was observed in day  <dig> cotyledons of horse gram seeds during  <dig> day germination period and also shown ph optima in acidic region suggesting that the enzyme is located in the vacuoles  <cit> . the role of specific proteases in seed protein degradation is unclearly understood, indeed, the overall role has been focus for direct investigation. we made an attempt to purify the endoprotease  from the cotyledons of horse gram and studied its properties and physiological role in the degradation of storage proteins. the purification procedure yielded an essentially homogeneous preparation with an over all recovery of  <dig> % and  <dig> fold purification. the final recovery of cprhg  was similar to that of other plant cysteine proteases i.e., vicilin peptidohydrolase  from mung bean seedlings  <cit>  and ga3- induced protease  from barley aleurone layers  <cit> , 15% acidic protease from germinating winged bean  <cit>  and 12% from indian beans  <cit> . the specific activity of the purified aspartic protease was  <dig>  u/mg with a recovery of 20% and existed as a single form from ficus racemosa  <cit> .

cprhg appeared to be monomeric protein with molecular weight of  <dig> k da  similar to other cysteine proteases isolated from germinating vicia sativa  <cit> , soyabean  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . however, the molecular weights of cysteine proteases isolated from vigna mungo seeds varied between 20- <dig> k da  <cit>  and in barley 30-  <dig> k da  <cit> . purified cprhg was found to contain two isoforms with iso-electric points, pi  <dig>  and  <dig>   as that of aleurain, isolated from aleurone cells, with two isoforms of pi values  <dig>  and  <dig>  and purified thiol protease from barley also had multiple forms including ep-a and ep-b  <cit> .

cprhg exhibits acidic ph optima by showing higher activity at  <dig> . discrepancy in ph optima was noticed for various protein substrates used in the assay, since a given substrate will have numerous ionizable groups with similar pka values. the ph optimum obtained with a protein substrate reflects more about the ph - mediated susceptibility of the substrate to proteolysis than about the influence of ph on the protease as a catalyst. a similar susceptibility to ph had been described for endopeptidase from phaseolous vulgaris  <cit> , barley  <cit>  and wheat  <cit> . since the purified cprhg was found to be stable in mildly acidic ph range  <dig>  -  <dig> , the enzyme may be localized in vivo in protein bodies like in other legume seeds  <cit> . the enzyme  exhibited surprisingly high temperature optima at 40°c and the catalytic reaction was linear with time for at least  <dig> hr at this temperature, which reflects resistance to autolysis and the results were correlated to the proteases of lentil seeds  <cit>  and barley  <cit> .

cprhg showed a high degree of specificity towards the natural substrates i.e., seed proteins from horse gram seeds and had completely an endoproteolytic activity, which suggested an important role in the mobilization of seed proteins during germination. in vitro digestion of seed proteins by purified cprhg led to the gradual disappearance of high molecular weight polypeptides. an aspartic endoprotease from wheat also exhibited the similar endoproteolytic activity with no exopeptidase activity  <cit> . studies with phaseolous vulgaris  <cit> , phaseolus mungo  <cit> , mung bean  <cit> , glycine max  <cit> , wheat  <cit>  and winged bean  <cit>  also indicated the role of cysteine endoprotease in the mobilization of stored proteins.

we have employed various inhibitors specific to each class of proteinases  in order to investigate the amino acid residue contributing to the active site of the enzyme. inhibition of the enzyme activity by heavy metal ions and inhibitors, sulfhydryl blocking reagents, and the reactivation of pcmb - treated enzyme by the addition of sulfhydryl reagents clearly established the thiol nature of the enzyme. however, the partial inhibition by other sulfhydryl blocking reagents suggests the involvement of other residue also in enzyme activity. the strong inhibition of cprhg by depc suggested the involvement of histidine at the active site along with cysteine as proposed for papain  <cit> . however, thiol proteases purified from winged bean  <cit>  and phaseolous vulgaris  <cit>  did not belong to the papain family. generally all thiol proteases have three conserved pairs of cysteine residues in their mature domain. however cprhg contained only one pair of cysteine residues . this data suggested that cprhg showed homology to other proteases, such as ep-c <dig> of phaseolous vulgaris  <cit>  and ep-a of barley  <cit> .

temporal changes in the levels of cprhg in the cotyledons of germinating horse gram seeds were observed by immunoblotting. in addition to  <dig> k da protein , the other three polypeptides with  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> k da was also cross-reacted with the antiserum. these results are similar to the development of endoprotease activity in germinating horse gram seeds, where increased development from day  <dig> to day  <dig> and decreased further  <cit> . information obtained from nbrf protein sequence data bank and translated gen bank database indicated that several cysteine proteases are produced as zymogens  <cit> . the polypeptide  with ≥  <dig> k da in the immunoblot appeared corresponding to the putative enzyme and the  <dig> and  <dig> k da polypeptides to the corresponding prepro- and pro-enzymes. the  <dig> k da polypeptide probably originated from the  <dig> k da protease. the endoproteses in the seeds of vigna mungo  <cit> , castor beans  <cit>  and barley  <cit>  were found to be synthesized as proenzymes and processed to the active forms during germination.

CONCLUSIONS
the temporal variations in cprhg activity, its acidic ph optimum and its ability to degrade native seed storage proteins preferentially fulfilled the criteria laid down for a protease to be involved in seed storage protein degradation during germination. it appears that the newly synthesized protease is inactive, and activation takes place during germination. the reported enzyme has broad substrate specificity and stability in ph, temperature, etc., therefore, this protease may turn out to be an efficient choice in pharmaceutical, medicinal, food, and biotechnology industry.
