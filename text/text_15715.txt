BACKGROUND
the kalligrammatidae are occasionally referred to as “butterflies of the jurassic”  <cit>  because of their large size and wingspans, presence of wings with patterned surfaces, including eyespots, and long maxillary palps. these features provide an appearance similar to some large, modern lepidopterans  <cit> . kalligrammatids also have a mosaic of structural features displayed in other, various neuropterans. their siphonate, long-proboscid mouthparts reported here for the first time, do not occur in modern neuroptera, although the long, curved and lanciform ovipositor that occurs in oregramma illecebrosa sp. nov. also is present among the modern pleasing lacewings of the dilaridae  <cit> . nevertheless, kalligrammatid lacewings, known only as compression fossils from the late middle jurassic  to mid early cretaceous , are an insect clade that exhibited a wide spectrum of diverse forms and appearances during the mid-mesozoic, with  <dig> genera previously reported from eurasia, including western europe, central asia, and northeastern china  <cit>  .

although the kalligrammatidae are readily identified by their distinctive appearance, there still are no definitive, conventional diagnoses available. some genera and species erected by early systematists and assigned to the kalligrammatidae were poorly described and based solely on fragmentary wings. there are conflicting relationships among genera and species within the family. for example, the monotypic genus palparites was erected by  <cit>  based on a poorly preserved specimen and an obfuscating description. lambkin  <cit>  reassigned the specimen to the kalligrammatidae, and mentioned that the specimen shares general characters with other kalligrammatids, such as a large body size and a dense network of crossveins. however, the systematic position of this genus within the kalligrammatidae remains uncertain. because of the rarity and quality of specimens, it has been difficult to conduct a comprehensive review of this family.

recently, a large number of well-preserved kalligrammatid specimens have been described from the mesozoic of china  <cit> , augmenting our knowledge of the family. here, we describe sixteen additional species, including three unassigned to a species and one unassigned to a genus from northeastern china ranging in age from late middle jurassic  to the mid early cretaceous . we redefine the family based on synapomorphic characters, and present a dichotomous key and classification of the genera. we conducted a phylogenetic analysis, and the results partition the kalligrammatidae into five subfamilies: kalligrammatinae handlirsch,  <dig>  <cit> , kallihemerobiinae ren and engel  <cit> , meioneurinae subfam. nov., oregrammatinae subfam. nov. and sophogrammatinae subfam. nov. our goal is to explore the relationships of various extinct kalligrammatid taxa, using a broad sample of well-described material. our study emphasizes the late middle jurassic of daohugou, inner mongolia autonomous region in northeastern china , the mid late jurassic of karatau, from southern kazakhstan , and the mid early cretaceous of liaoning and hebei provinces in northeastern china . the kalligrammatidae exhibit an elevated speciosity and broad morphological diversity during the mid-mesozoic, suggesting these large insects were a significant ecologic component within the ecosystems they inhabited.

redescription
large insects ; densely setose throughout the body and wings. antennae filiform, usually not exceeding the length of forewing. mouthparts mandibulate, or more commonly siphonate and forming a prominent proboscis from conjoined maxillary galeae. forewing exceptionally large and broad, more than 50 mm long, approximately triangular or oviform in outline; usually bearing distinct, prominent eyespots positioned in the centers of the wing. costal region expanded, costal veinlets dichotomously branched distally , interlinked by numerous smaller veinlets. sc and r <dig> fused distally; r1-rs crossveins numerous; the basal stem of rs and r <dig> usually fused, with the exception of affinigramma gen. nov., apochrysogramma and kallihemerobius where the separation of rs from r <dig> is distal from wing base. ma typically originating from rs as in most neuropterans, except for affinigramma gen. nov. and kallihemerobius, with ma diverging from r1; orb diverging from r <dig>  forming a few pectinate branches, present in some genera of subfamily kallihemerobiinae; mp extensively branched, mp <dig> with many distal pectinate branches, consisting of an expansive, triangular region, regarded as an autapomorphy of kalligrammatidae . cu forked near wing base; cua and cup forming complex secondary branches. anal region broad; 1a parallel to the posterior margin, with complexly bifurcating branches. hind wing generally triangular; costal veinlets typically simple or with few distal bifurcations.

remarks
the extinct family kalligrammatidae is characterized by remarkably large body size, extremely broad wing shape, unusually dense venation and complex secondary branches of longitudinal veins, which allow separation from other families by their branching pattern. in general, specimens of kalligrammatidae are poorly preserved with overlapping, incomplete or fragmentary wings. some species historically were poorly described, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the morphological breadth within the family. the exact definition of the family is imprecise because of the allocation of taxa to varied groups and poor descriptions of many species. one example is the genus angarogramma, erected by ponomarenko in  <dig>  although the venation in the published drawing is overly simplified to provide useful information  <cit> , the specimen still could be attributed to the kalligrammatidae from the distinctive wing shape. but its generic status is doubtful, as it lacks valid diagnostic characters. for this reason, we propose the above diagnosis of the kalligrammatidae for unambiguous differentiation of this family from other families of neuroptera.

diagnosis
no convincing characters uniquely define the kallihemerobiinae. however, the parsimony analysis below indicates that the deep ma bifurcation indicates monophyly of the kallihemerobiinae. however, establishment of robust characters for the kallihemerobiinae monophyly requires further testing with additional specimens and data.

genus 
stelligramma
 gen. nov.



type species.stelligramma allochroma sp. nov.

etymology
the generic name is derived from the latin stella, meaning “star” or “astral”, and the greek gramma, meaning “lined” or “written”, referring to wings resembling a manuscript; also a common suffix for kalligrammatid genera. gender feminine.

diagnosis
forewing without eyespot markings. humeral recurrent veins  evident. most costal veinlets curved, deeply forked near wing margin, bearing one to three interlinked veinlets. rs with pectinate branches, all bifurcate. ma forked at vein midsection. cu forked into two branches at wing base; cua pectinately forked terminally and cup dichotomously forked at midvein. 1a deeply dichotomously forked; 2a pectinately forked, each branch dichotomously forked; 3a simple.

remarks
the genus stelligramma gen. nov. has a common kalligrammatid-like appearance, and was assigned to the subfamily kallihemerobiinae. the kallihemerobiine assemblage is complex for its varied wing structure, including the absence of the orb, and narrow costal region. based on our phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of subfamily kallihemerobiinae is supported by a single character: proximal forking of the 1a vein. stelligramma gen. nov. and kalligrammula constitute the stem-group of kallihemerobiinae, representing the earliest divergence of the subfamily. this divergence implies that absence of the orb among stelligramma gen. nov. and kalligrammula is likely an ancestral feature.


stelligramma allochroma
 sp. nov. 



diagnosis. as for the genus, by monotypy.

etymology
the epithet of allochroma is derived from the greek words, allos, meaning “other” or “different”, and chroma, meaning “color” or “hue”.

holotype
a well-preserved forewing ; specimen cnu-neu-nn2010-012p/c . sex unknown.

type locality and horizon

measurements
holotype, cnu-neu-nn2010-012p/c : forewing ca. 90 mm long, 44 mm wide.

description
one partially preserved forewing . axial body not preserved. forewing approximately obtuse-triangular. eyespot or spot absent. humeral recurrent veins  evident. most costal veinlets curved and deeply forked at wing margin, between which are one or two interlinked veinlets. r <dig> parallel to sc where preserved. rs with more than  <dig> original branches, all bifurcate. ma forked at vein midsection; mp forked near wing base, with at least  <dig> pectinate branches, the first simple, the others dichotomously forked. cu forked into two branches at wing base; cua parallel with mp and pectinately forked at end; cup dichotomously forked at vein midsection. 1a forked earlier than cup, deeply dichotomously forked; 2a with ca.  <dig> pectinate branches, each dichotomously forked; 3a simple. wing spot obvious on forewing, consisting of one black, circular splotch.

kallihemerobiinae gen. et sp. indet. 

material
a mostly poorly preserved specimen with partial body and wing impression; specimen cnu-neu-nn2009- <dig> . sex unknown.

type locality and horizon
jiulongshan formation, middle jurassic, daohugou village, shantou township, ningcheng county, inner mongolia, china.

description
body preserved in ventral view . head better preserved; compound eyes hemispheroidal, modest; proboscis present, with maxillary palps; antenna filiform, only left antenna  preserved. legs incompletely preserved. dense crossveins throughout the wings. forewing costal region broad; all costal veinlets sinuate, deeply forked; other structures indistinct. forewing spot or eyespot absent.

remarks
the presence of a siphonate proboscis and an orb suggests that this specimen unequivocally belongs to the kallihemerobiinae. however, other parts of the specimen are so poorly preserved that they lacks diagnostic information to determine the specimens’ generic status. we assign this specimen as gen. et sp. indet. to the kallihemerobiinae.

subfamily kalligrammatinae handlirsch, 1906

type genus:kalligramma walther, 1904

included genera
type genus and angarogramma ponomarenko, 1984; kalligrammina panfilov, 1980; limnogramma ren, 2003; and sinokalligramma zhang,  <dig> 

diagnosis
apomorphic characters defining the kalligrammatinae are: 1), distal pectinate branching in the anterior media  vein; 2), complex branching along the distal course of the anterior cubitus  vein; and 3), complex branching along the distal course of the posterior cubitus  vein.

remarks
the subfamily consists of five genera typical of the kalligrammatidae. the kalligrammatinae is distinguished from the other subfamilies by the following characters: 1), a broad triangular mp region versus parallel mp branches among the sophogrammatinae; 2), absence of an orb versus presence of an orb among kallihemerobiinae; and 3), a complex costal cross-venation versus simple costal cross-venation among meioneurinae and oregrammatinae. although the establishment of the kalligrammatinae is based on a combination of the above apomorphic characters, this taxon currently lacks a synapomorphy.

diagnosis
most costal veinlets curved and forking multichotomously; interlinked veinlets between costal veinlets abundant. rs with more than  <dig> primary branches; mp forked near wing base, with  <dig> pectinate branches, the first forked later than the second. cu divided into cua and cup near base; one intercalary vein between cu and 1a.

etymology
the specific epithet of brachyrhyncha is derived from the greek words of “brachy”, meaning “short” or “abbreviated”, and rhynchos, for “beak” or “mouth”.

holotype
a partially preserved specimen  with four overlapping wings and incomplete body; specimen cnu-neu-nn2009-030p/c . sex unknown.

type locality and horizon
jiulongshan formation, middle jurassic, daohugou village, shantou township, ningcheng county, inner mongolia, china.

measurements

remarks
kalligramma brachyrhyncha sp. nov. is attributable to the genus kalligramma based on the above-mentioned characters. kalligramma brachyrhyncha sp. nov. is similar to k. turutanovae <cit>  in forewing structure, although k. turutanovae is preserved without a hind wing. in the new species, the rs has more than six primary branches, whereas k. turutanovae has more than eight. in the new species the mp is forked near the wing base, with six pectinate branches, the first forked later than the second, whereas in k. turutanovae the mp has three visible branches, and the first is forked earlier than the second. in the new species, the cu is divided into a cua and a cup near the wing base, and one intercalary vein occurs between the cu and 1a; by contrast, in k. turutanovae both the cua and cup are pectinately forked.

kalligramma brachyrhyncha sp. nov. resembles k. multinerve <cit>  in forewing features. the new species has most costal veinlets curved, forking multichotomously, and interlinked with all regional veinlets, whereas k. multinerve has costal veinlets forked twice, lacking crossveins posteriorly, and sc and r <dig> are not fused in the preserved material. in the new species, the mp has six pectinate branches, but in k. multinerve the mp has three visible branches. for the new species the cu is divided into a cua and a cup near the wing base, and one intercalary vein occurs between the cu and 1a, but in k. multinerve the cua is simple.


kalligramma circularia

type species.abrigramma calophleba sp. nov.

diagnosis
humeral recurrent veins  absent. forewing rs with at least  <dig> primary branches, all single. ma pectinately forked, having a false origin from mp. 2a with ca.  <dig> pectinately forked branches. hind wing rs almost originating from r <dig> at 1/ <dig> of the distance from its base, branching at ca. apical third of wing length, forming at least  <dig> primary branches. mp first branch forked nearly at base of wing, third branch terminates at the wing’s posterior border, before wing apex. 2a with at least  <dig> pectinate branches; 3a short, with  <dig> pectinate, dichotomous branches.

etymology
the generic name is derived from the french abri, a “shelter” or “haven”, a modification of the latin, apricum, for “an open place”, referring to the spreading wings of this species; and the greek, gramma, meaning “lined” or “written”, referring to wings provided with a manuscript-like appearance, also a common suffix of kalligrammatid genera. the gender is feminine.

remarks
this new genus and new species, abrigramma calophleba gen. et sp. nov., is placed in the kalligrammatidae based on the following characters: 1), the forewing is remarkably large, with a costal area of moderate width; 2), the r <dig> is unbranched; 3), the rs has numerous pectinate branches; and 4) the mp is extensively branched and provided with several main branches anteriorly and numerous crossveins over the entire wing. the hind wing is noticeably large, with its costal area demonstrably larger than representatives of related families. in addition, the r <dig> is unbranched, the rs has few pectinate branches, the ma is forked shallowly along the posterior part of the wing, the mp is pectinately forked, and abundant crossveins occur throughout the wing.

discussion
results of the phylogenetic analysis
an analyses using nona with four successive outgroups resulted in nine most parsimonious trees , each consisting of  <dig> steps . species in the same genus were well grouped in the cladogram except for ithigramma and oregramma . the genus ithigramma with its character of densely setose forewings distinctly differed from oregramma. however, ithigramma was nested within an oregramma clade in the mpts. this paraphyly probably was caused by poor preservation of the ithigramma specimen, which lacked sufficient information for differentiation from oregramma. in addition, the other genera were well grouped monophyletically in the analysis with a minor exception in the interrelationships of kalligramma .

the analyses by paup resulted in  <dig> mpts, also of  <dig> steps , which were similar to the nona analyses. in both trees of strict consensus and 50% major consensus, ithigramma and oregramma became a paraphyly, with slightly different results vs. the nona analyses .

the bayesian analyses did not adequately resolve the interrelationships of the kalligrammatidae , similar to the parsimony analyses. in the bayesian analyses, the kalligrammatidae was divided into three paraphyletic groups; however, the clade kalligramma was not recovered as a monophyly , same as the results of parsimony analyses. the other apparent discrepancy between bayesian and parsimony analyses  involved the placement of sophogramma, grouped with kalligrammula, stelligramma, lithogramma, affinigramma, huiyingogramma and kallihemerobius, instead of the earliest divergence of the kalligrammatidae. however, there are some clades in which bayesian and parsimony analyses agree, confirming three monophyletic groups: sophogramma, meioneurites, and an abrigramma + ithigramma + oregramma clade.

phylogeny of kalligrammatidae
because of incomplete information from a few poorly preserved specimens, not all clades received firm support in the phylogenetic analyses. based on the phylogenetic results , we propose a rationalized phylogenetic tree of the kalligrammatidae that includes all genera, but excludes palparites . in the phylogenetic analysis, the monophyly of the kalligrammatidae is firmly recovered, which shares the synapomorphic characters of a complex ma bifurcation and a broad triangular forewing and hind wing. the kalligrammatidae is divided into five primary clades, allocated to the subfamilies sophogrammatinae subfam. nov., meioneurinae subfam. nov., oregrammatinae subfam. nov., kalligrammatinae  <cit>  and kallihemerobiinae  <cit> .

the assemblage of the sophogrammatinae subfam. nov. was expected, which contains two well-defined genera, sophogramma <cit>  and protokalligramma <cit> . however, the phylogenetic position of the subfamily remains in question because of the difference between the parsimony and bayesian analysis. we note that the clade consisting of the sophogrammatinae and kallihemerobiinae received low posterior probability in the bayesian results . the grouping of the sophogrammatinae and kallihemerobiinae is likely an artificial construct from incomplete data. based on the parsimony results, the sophogrammatinae represents the earliest divergence of the kalligrammatidae, and is the sister-group to all other kalligrammatids. this subfamily can be differentiated from other subfamilies by the trajectory of the mp, in which both branches are parallel and bent posteriorly and distally, versus the alternate condition in which the mp <dig> diverges from the mp <dig> close to the wing base, and forms a large triangular region, present in the other four subfamilies . however, the absence of eyespots within the sophogrammatinae  distinctly implies a plesiomorphy for kalligrammatidae ; hence, the occurrence of eyespots in other kalligrammatids should be a derived feature. nevertheless, the absence of eyespots among kalligrammula, meioneurites spectabilis and angarogramma is likely the result of poor preservation or possibly plesiomorphous retention. the humeral recurrent vein is slightly variable within most kalligrammatidae, whereas it is well represented in the sophogrammatinae and can be regarded as a synapomorphy of the subfamily .

the other four subfamilies share the three synapomorphic characters  of eyespot presence, and a distinctively triangular mp region. this larger clade is subdivided into two clades, the meioneurinae subfam. nov. + oregrammatinae subfam. nov., and the kalligrammatinae  <cit>  + kallihemerobiinae  <cit>  . the sister-group relationships of the meioneurinae and oregrammatinae are stable in the phylogenetic analysis, and weakly supported by the two homoplasious characters of less interlinked veinlets along the costal region and simple distal cu <dig> forks. the subfamily meioneurinae consists of only one genus, meioneurites <cit> , from the late jurassic, and has the character of distal branching of mp . the subfamily oregrammatinae includes three highly homogenous genera: oregramma <cit> , abrigramma gen. nov., and ithigramma gen. nov., that share the three synapomorphic characters of a distally constricted costal region, a sinuate mp close to the wing base and a medially broadened cu region .

although the kalligrammatinae and kallihemerobiinae are not grouped as a clade in the bayesian analyses, we prefer the sister relationship of the kalligrammatinae and kallihemerobiinae that was firmly supported by the character of a deep ma bifurcation in the parsimony results . in the analyses, the iconic genus kalligramma was not fully recovered from the bayesian results . however, kalligramma is well established by the single synapomorphic character of a distal complex cua bifurcation in the parsimony analysis . we consider the controversial placement of this genus might be caused by poor preservation of the specimens. herein, we tentatively assign four other kalligrammatine-like genera – angarogramma <cit> , limnogramma <cit> , kalligrammina <cit>  and sinokalligramma <cit>  – to the subfamily kalligrammatinae based on the presumed characters of a broadly triangular forewing and hind wing, and a 1a vein forked medially or distally . the interrelationships of kalligrammatinae currently are not fully resolved because of an inordinate amount of missing data.

in the phylogenetic results the monophyly of kallihemerobiinae is partially recovered, principally based on sharing the single plausible character of a proximal bifurcation of the 1a vein, retrieved from the parsimony analysis . based on the results of our analysis, we expand the definition of the kallihemerobiinae. as for the former definition of the subfamily based on the presence of the orb, only three genera, affinigramma, apochrysogramma and kallihemerobius, can be attributed to the kallihemerobiinae . the affiliation of the four heterogeneous genera of stelligramma, kalligrammula, huiyingogramma and lithogramma to the subfamily is not consistent with our current knowledge, which is probably the result of poor preservation for specimens of these genera. the genus lithogramma seems to be related to the traditional kallihemerobiinae, sharing a similar expanded costal region and fewer rs branches . the genera huiyingogramma, kalligrammula and stelligramma are attributed to kallihemerobiinae temporarily, pending future additional evidence to determine their subfamilial status.

although the interrelationships among the subfamilies are not fully resolved, our analyses are an initial probe into the internal phylogeny of kalligrammatidae. future fossil discoveries and additional structural evidence, as they become available, as well as new analyses, will further a more secure placement of the less character-rich taxa.

diversity of the kalligrammatidae
the kalligrammatidae were a dominant lineage among neuroptera during the mesozoic era, as measured by speciosity. from the histograms of species and generic richness , kalligrammatids were well established and exhibited, as a group, a relatively flat level of diversity from the late middle jurassic at 165 ma to the mid early cretaceous at 125 ma., and are recorded from important eurasian deposits. however, the internal composition of taxa does vary . the diversity of the subfamily kallihemerobiinae, for example, gradually decreases from the later middle jurassic to the earlier early cretaceous. a similar pattern also was present for the subfamily kalligrammatinae, abundant during the middle jurassic and late jurassic, but slackening considerably during the early cretaceous. the two sister subfamilies of meioneurinae and oregrammatinae occur solely during the late jurassic and early cretaceous, respectively, revealing the independent origin of new phylogenetic lineages long after earlier kalligrammatid lineages were established during the earlier jurassic. the subfamily sophogrammatinae was recorded from two separate periods: the middle jurassic, where it probably represents the most basal kalligrammatid lineage, and the early cretaceous, implying a temporally displaced rediversification of the subfamily.

as for most neuropterans, kalligrammatids probably were weak flyers, and the typically large body size undoubtedly made them easy targets for contemporaneous predators. the same condition also occurred in other mesozoic groups of the neuroptera, the extinct aetheogrammatidae  <cit> , saucrosmylinae  <cit> , grammolingiidae  <cit>  and panfiloviidae  <cit> , all of which possessed rather large body size. for survival and reproduction, these large insects required special avoidance strategies. wang et al.  <cit>  reported that the earliest and only known pinnate leaf mimesis by lacewings was bellinympha filicifolia <cit>  and bellinympha dancei <cit> , both from the late middle jurassic. this association exhibited unique behavioral features, revealing a specialized association between insects and gymnosperms that was lost in more recently derived lineages. as for the kalligrammatidae, the group presents several morphological and behavioral innovations . the presence of eyespots in the kalligrammatidae implies that kalligrammatids were probably diurnal insects. sophogramma lii possesses two symmetrical, undulate light-colored stripes near the outer wing margin  <cit> , which can be interpreted as a disruptive coloration . in a related phenomenon, olofsson et al.  <cit>  reported wing-margin eyespots in a lepidopteran that reduced attacks on vital body parts by birds. the marginal markings on sophogramma lii likely had a similar defensive function, misleading predators to attack the wing margin instead of vital, axially located body parts.

during the  <dig> million years from the late middle jurassic  to mid early cretaceous , the kalligrammatidae may have provided an important role in their relationships with plants and avoidance of predators. kalligrammatids bore either mandibulate or more commonly siphonate mouthparts, often deployed wing markings, including stripes, spots and eyespots and displayed varied wing shapes, indicating that the kalligrammatidae underwent an evolutionary diversification during the mid-mesozoic. the disappearance of kalligrammatidae and absence of their diverse features in modern neuropterans is enigmatic, although there may be modern analogs  <cit> . the eventual extinction of these giant insects may have been precipitated by the emergence of angiosperms and associated environmental turnover that began during the mid-early cretaceous.

CONCLUSIONS
new fossils from china provide insight into the evolution of the kalligrammatidae, and suggest that eastern eurasia may have been the center of origin for the family during the mid-mesozoic. based on phylogenetic analyses and detailed morphological characters, we describe several new genera and species, and propose a new classification encompassing the kalligrammatidae that is partitioned into five principal clades that are accorded subfamilial rank. they are sophogrammatinae subfam. nov., meioneurinae subfam. nov., oregrammatinae subfam. nov., kalligrammatinae  <cit>  and kallihemerobiinae  <cit> . kalligrammatids are perhaps the most successful mesozoic neuropteran lineage, exhibiting an extraordinary breadth of form, taxonomic diversity and ecological dominance that included a variety of plant-insect associations and deterrence from predators. these features indicate that the evolutionary biology of mid mesozoic kalligrammatid lacewings was more complex than previously realized.
