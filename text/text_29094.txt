BACKGROUND
staphylococcus epidermidis is a common skin and mucous commensal of healthy humans, and can easily be transmitted to medical devices being a serious clinical problem and one of the major causes of nosocomial infections
 <cit>  as well as mastitis in lactating women
 <cit> . in the animal health context s. epidermidis has also been recognized as one of the main etiological agents of ovine and bovine mastitis
 <cit> .

s. epidermidis is a key factor in the transmission of virulence factors and it is involved in balancing epithelial microbiota. in contrast to s. aureus, s. epidermidis does not encode many virulence factors, but it can colonize the hospital environment due to its ability to form biofilms favouring adhesion to host tissues, medical devices and increasing resistance to antibiotics
 <cit> . in addition, the enormous flexibility of this bacterium continuously generates continuously novel phenotypic and genotypic variants. hospital isolates are often characterised by the carriage of several staphylococcal chromosome cassettes , conferring methicillin resistance
 <cit> . moreover, nosocomial s. epidermidis strains typically harbour multiple copies of the insertion sequence element is <dig> in their genomes, which contribute to genetic adaptation during infection
 <cit> . recently, the first s. epidermidis pathogenicity island , which encodes the staphylococcal enterotoxin sec <dig> and sell, has been described
 <cit> .

the widespread use of antibiotics in both humans and animals has led to the emergence of infectious bacteria resistant to a wide range of antimicrobials that greatly hinders their treatment. as a result of the search for complementary agents to antibiotics, phage therapy has resurfaced as means to prevent and treat infectious diseases. phages have already been tested as anti-infectives in humans and animals
 <cit> , and phage-encoded lytic proteins may also be used to inhibit pathogenic bacteria
 <cit> . in addition, the use of phages to destroy biofilms has gained much interest over the past years
 <cit> . however, scarce information exists regarding the role of phages in eliminating s. epidermidis biofilms
 <cit> . this is probably due to the limited number of phages infecting this species that have been characterized so far
 <cit> .

we have previously isolated and characterized three phages infecting s. epidermidis strains which belong to the siphoviridae family 
 <cit> . phage vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  behaved as a virulent phage, probably derived from vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  while vb_sepis-phiipla <dig>  was temperate. both phages exhibited plaques surrounded by an increasing halo zone indicative of a polysaccharide depolymerase activity
 <cit> . moreover, in challenge assays phi-ipla <dig> had lytic capability against s. epidermidis <cit> .

in the present work, the complete genome of phages phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> has been sequenced, annotated and compared with those previously described for staphylococcal phages. genes encoding putative depolymerase activities were identified in these genomes. in addition, a representative s. epidermidis strain collection has been analyzed by using a multiplex pcr and the frequency of certain prophage groups determined. this study thus provides the basis for the evaluation of phages to control s. epidermidis strains.

RESULTS
due to the renewed interest in phage therapy and the ability of phages to successfully combat infections in both animals and humans, the aim of this work was the genetic characterization of two new s. epidermidis phages  to investigate their potential as antimicrobials and, more specifically, as anti-biofilm agents based on our previous observations of the presence of an increasing halo surrounding the lysis plaques, indicating a depolymerase activity
 <cit> .

genome overview of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> phages
both phages have a linear, double-stranded dna genome consisting of  <dig>  bp encoding  <dig> putative orfs in phi-ipla <dig>  while the phi-ipla <dig> genome was  <dig>  bp and  <dig> putative orfs were identified . the g + c content of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> was  <dig> %, which is slightly higher than that of s. epidermidis strains 
 <cit> . a blastn search revealed that nucleotide sequence of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> shared a high degree of similarity with the other two s. epidermidis phages phiph <dig> and phicnph <dig> 
 <cit> . bioinformatic analysis revealed a similar organization of the two phages in five functional modules  that perfectly fits the general structure of most double-stranded dna bacteriophages
 <cit> . several putative promoters and terminators in phi-ipla <dig> and in phi-ipla <dig> were found by searching for the s. aureus σ70-dependent promoter consensus motif . the deduced promoter positions are consistent with a modular arrangement and imply that there is modular control of gene expression. the putative transcription pattern of both phages reveals two main groups of orfs running divergently and one of them includes the lysogenic cassette.

the amino acid  sequences of the predicted orfs were searched for similarities to sequences from the available databases . significant matches were obtained for  <dig> orfs from phi-ipla <dig> and  <dig> orfs from phi-ipla <dig> and biological functions were assigned. no trna genes were found. no virulence genes were clearly identified.

in the dna packaging module, the putative large terminase subunit of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> showed homology  with those belonging to the pac-type phages such as bacillus subtilis phage spp <dig>  it has been suggested that different functional classes of phage-encoded terminases can be predicted from their amino acid sequence
 <cit> . confirmation of this result was obtained by restriction analysis of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> dnas with the endonuclease xbai. the phage genomes both have two cut sites but produced two single bands on agarose gels , which suggests that both phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> genomes were circularly permuted.

in the structural module, the predicted major head and major tail proteins had a molecular mass consisting with previous protein analysis of virion particles, which showed a major polypeptide  in phage phi-ipla <dig> and two main proteins  in phi-ipla <dig>  respectively
 <cit> . putative virion-associate hydrolases  with an aminoterminal endopeptidase tail domain and a sgnh hydrolase domain related with lipases and esterases, were identified. finally, pre neck appendage proteins  with pectin-lyase like domains weer identified that could also be involved in the extracellular material degradation.

phage phi-ipla <dig>  although strictly lytic, encoded a deficient lysis-lysogeny module. the phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> gp34* proteins shared extended similarity with repressors of the ci type. a one-base replacement that shifted a tac codon to the stop codon taa was mapped at  <dig> nt resulting in a second orf . no rbs upstream of orf34* could be detected. the presence of a truncated ci repressor in phi-ipla <dig> would explain why the phage was unable to lysogenize
 <cit> . in the ci-cro intergenic regions of both phages, two adjacent and outward-facing putative promoters for cro and repressor genes were identified . additionally, two 7-bp direct repeats overlapping the two putative promoters in phi-ipla <dig> were recognized . these sequences might be putative operators for the binding of ci repressor which have been reported as regulators in the lysogeny module gene expression
 <cit> .

in the replication module, both phages contained dna replication proteins  with dnab domains which are essential in replication initiation, as well as dnad domains which are a component of the primosome. phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> displayed homology to a holliday junction resolvase 
 <cit> . phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> had homology with yopx proteins, an uncharacterized, well-conserved family of proteins found in bacteriophage and prophage regions of gram-positive bacteria. a putative dutpase gene gp <dig> was predicted in phi-ipla <dig> genome which is highly conserved in several staphylococcal and lactococcal phages
 <cit> . gp <dig> and gp <dig> from phi-ipla <dig> and gp <dig> and gp <dig> from phi-ipla <dig> displayed similarity to the rina and rinb family of transcriptional regulators. recently, the rina family proteins have been showed as activators required for transcription of the late operon in temperate staphylococcal phages
 <cit> .

comparative genomics of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> phages
blastn database searches with the complete genome sequence of phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> revealed similarity at the nucleotide level with the two previously described s. epidermidis phages ph <dig> and cnph <dig> and with s. aureus phages such as phiew, phi <dig>  phi <dig>  phi52a and phi <dig>  comparison of these phages using mauve software revealed gene synteny among the four s. epidermidis phages. four homology blocks mostly matched the morphogenesis and integration, the lysis-lysogeny, replication, and regulation modules, . extensive similarity in the head and tail morphogenesis modules was observed among the s. epidermidis phages genomes and other staphylococcus phages . in fact, s. epidermidis phages ph <dig> and cnph <dig> have been shown to be highly similar to class ii clade c of s. aureus phages
 <cit> . an exception was observed in the putative exonuclease encoding gene  from phi-ipla <dig>  which was not found in phi-ipla <dig> or in other staphylococcal phages. the phi-ipla <dig> lysis region seemed to be rather unique, specifically in the holin encoding gene , to which no similarity was detected within other s. epidermidis phages. the holin phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> protein showed similarity  to the holin from s. aureus phage  <dig> while the holin phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> protein was identical to those in phages ph <dig> and cnph <dig>  similarly, the phi-ipla <dig> lysin encoding gene  did not have any matching gene in other phages. moreover, the lysin phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> protein belongs to the amidase_ <dig> family while those of phi.ipla <dig>  and the lysins from s. epidermidis phages ph <dig> and cnph <dig> were highly similar  and belong to the amidase_ <dig> family. a similar pattern was observed in the region surrounding the integrase gene. the putative integrase gene  of phi-ipla <dig> differed from that in phi-ipla <dig>  and the corresponding protein  was 70% similar to that of s. aureus phi <dig>  while the integrase phi-ipla <dig> protein  resembled that of s. epidermidis ph <dig> and cnph <dig>  the phage integrases from the newly isolated phages belonged to different families .

finally, no similarity with other phages was detected for the antirepressor encoding gene  found in the phi-ipla <dig> lysis-lysogeny region, based on these data, s. epidermidis ph <dig> and cnph <dig> and s. aureus phages phiew, phi <dig>  phi <dig>  phi52a and phi <dig> are the closest relatives to phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig>  the extensive similarity between these phages is mainly in the morphogenetic region as previously reported on other siphoviridae phages
 <cit> . the observed homology in other regions or modules supports the modular theory of phage evolution
 <cit> .

incidence and typing of prophages in s. epidermidis strains
previous studies have shown that prophages integrated in the bacterial chromosomes are the most widespread mobile genetic elements in s. aureus strains, which tipically carry between one and four prophages
 <cit> . however, the prophage content in s. epidermidis has not been determined to date. to approach this, the integrase , holin  and major head protein  genes were selected as marker modules as previously described in by
 <cit>  who studied genome mosaicism in prophages of s. aureus. based on the genome wide comparison among phages and further in silico analysis of the integrase genes from the four s. epidermidis phages , two groups were identified: int <dig> comprised by the highly similar int genes from phi-ipla <dig>  ph <dig>  and cnph <dig>  and int <dig> composed by int phi-ipla <dig> to which no similarities were found among them. likewise, s. epidermidis phage holin genes defined two groups: hol <dig> group comprised by hol phi-ipla <dig>  ph <dig>  and cnph <dig>  and hol <dig> group that included hol phi-ipla <dig>  finally, the phi-ipla <dig> mhp gene was very similar to phi-ipla <dig>  and ph <dig>  but no counterpart was identified in cnph <dig>  based on amino acid sequence homology this protein belongs to the phage-capsid superfamily. the presence or absence of this gene generated the mhp <dig> and mhp <dig> groups, respectively.

the presence of prophages in our s. epidermidis collection containing  <dig> isolates from women breast milk was investigated by a multiplex pcr to amplify the above mentioned genes . prophages of the group mhp <dig> were the most frequent  but none of the other targeted markers were amplified in these strains . about 10% of the isolates were included in the mhp <dig> group and were mostly associated to the int <dig> marker. we also observed that some phage groups were completely absent and others were less frequent. there were also some strains in which no amplification was observed pointing to the absence of prophages or the presence of other genes not detected by our pcr approach. it is remarkable that, besides the  <dig> s. aureus bacteriophage integrase gene classes analysed previously
 <cit> , many other types of modules containing lysogenic functions, dna replication, packaging, tail appendices and host lysis were described in s. aureus phages, revealing the high diversity and the mosaic structure of prophages in this species
 <cit> .

previous studies suggested that the integrase type group in s. aureus strains is closely linked to the virulence gene content of prophages and might therefore convey information about their pathogenic potential
 <cit> . we found that the largest group of s. epidermidis prophages belongs to int <dig> group, which was mostly found in mastitic strains. on the other hand, prevalence of prophages, as defined by the positive amplification of at least one marker gene, was higher  in strains producing mastitis. this result would support the hypothesis that prophages are directly involved in virulence
 <cit> . however, no virulence factors have been described to date in s. epidermidis phages.

in our previous work, the yield of mitomycin c inducible prophages in s. epidermidis was rather low  and we hypothesized that it could be due to the lack of appropriately sensitive host strains to detect them
 <cit> . in view of the new pcr results, phage dna sequences were present in 73% of the analyzed s. epidermidis strains. although amplification of at least one of the markers does not necessarily mean that the bacterial strains are lysogens , our results support the notion that lysogeny in s. epidermidis may be higher than anticipated and likely more frequent among clinical strains, as noted previously in s. aureus strains isolated from diverse clinical samples
 <cit> .

virion proteins with a putative hydrolytic activity of extracellular components
a pectin lyase-like domain  was identified in the pre-neck appendage protein of both phages . recently, it has been demonstrated that some tail spike proteins similar to pectin lyases have exopolysaccharide  degrading activity
 <cit> . similar proteins to phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> were identified by blastp search in ph <dig> and cnph <dig> phages, s. aureus phage  <dig>  bacillus phage phi <dig> and prophages in several bacillus species . surprisingly, most of the phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> related proteins belonged to bacillus sp and not to other staphylococcal species. it is remarkable that all the proteins analyzed were highly conserved at the predicted binding site  and the residues responsible for the interaction with the ligand were shared by the different phages . to support the predicted catalytic domains, the software phyre <dig> was used to predict the tridimensional structure  of the protein phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> to which, the primary structure of the counterpart protein from phi-ipla <dig> was 98% identical. to model phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> , the crystal structure of the bacteriophage phi <dig> gp <dig> neck protein from bacillus subtilis <cit>  was used. 82% of phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> amino acids were predicted at a confidence level of 90%. the pectin lyase-like domain   displayed a right-handed continuous twelve helix repetition, where each coil of the helix featured three beta-strands and three turn regions. proteins containing these repeats most often are enzymes with polysaccharide substrates, and it was demonstrated that this topology is shared by several proteins, with the variation in the number of coils, including bacterial pectate lyases, fungal and bacterial galacturonases and phage tail spikes
 <cit> . on the other hand, no amino acid sequence homology was detected between phi-ipla <dig> gp <dig> and pseudomonas putida ϕ <dig> tail spike protein, although this also showed right handed beta helical folds identified in carbohydrate depolymerizing enzymes
 <cit> .

biofilm degradation by phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> phages
three lines of evidence were pointing to a putative anti-biofilm activity by the newly isolated s. epidermidis phages phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig>  first, as previously reported
 <cit> , a halo surrounding the clear lysis plaques could be observed which increased with time. these halos are regarded as an indicator for the presence of phage-associated eps depolymerases
 <cit> . secondly, a clear zone was previously observed when phages phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig> were dropped on some bacterial strains . these strains were resistant to infection meaning that no plaques were observed when the phage stock was diluted and plated on these strains
 <cit> . third, based on sequence comparison and 3d predictions, two candidate proteins were identified as putative eps degrading enzymes. to investigate if these phages were involved in biofilm degradation, cell counts and phage titre of the clear zone where the phage suspension is dropped, and into the host cell lawn were carried out. as expected, lower bacterial counts were found when the phages were dropped onto the sensitive strain s. epidermidis f <dig> while viable counts of the resistant s. epidermidis cjbp <dig> remained unaltered . interestingly, the clear zone generated on the drop-sensitive strains revealed similar bacterial counts to the bacterial lawn despite its distinct visual appearance. moreover, s. epidermidis f <dig> clearly supported phage propagation, while no phages were detected when sampling the drop zone of the resistant and drop sensitive strains . overall, these results supports the presence of phage depolymerase activity, although we can not totally discard our previous hypothesis that ascribed the clear zone on drop-sensitive strains to “lysis from without”
 <cit> .

in order to confirm the ability of the phages to mediate biofilm degradation, the three types of strains were grown in microtiter plates for  <dig> days for biofilm formation and subsequently challenged with phage phi-ipla <dig>  viability of the sensitive s. epidermidis f <dig> in both planktonic and biofilm cells was readily reduced even after  <dig> h in the presence of the phage, and only 5% of the total counts survived  after  <dig> h . in the case of the drop-sensitive s. epidermidis cjbp <dig>  total cell numbers remained unchanged  at both  <dig> h and  <dig> h. however, a dramatic shift towards the planktonic state was observed in the presence of the phage and, after  <dig> h, and just 2% of the cells remained attached . these data support the ability of phage phi-ipla <dig> to degrade the extracellular material of the biofilm, releasing the attached cells. on the contrary, neither the viability nor the biofilm formed by the resistant strain s. epidermidis cjbp <dig> was affected by phage phi-ipla <dig> . a different composition in the extracellular biofilm material could explain this result. studies on staphylococcal biofilm development suggest that the extracellular matrix consists of proteins, dna, and/or polysaccharide 
 <cit> . recently, it has become evident that some strains are not reliant on pia for biofilm formation
 <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this work, we have presented a detailed genomic and molecular characterization of two new s. epidermidis phages, phi-ipla <dig> and phi-ipla <dig>  based on this, a multiplex pcr was designed that revealed a high prevalence of prophage and/or defective prophages within s. epidermidis strains. genome mining detected the presence of virion-associated proteins with a putative eps depolymerase activity. to our knowledge, this is the first time that degradation of extracellular material has been ascribed to s. epidermidis phages. further studies to confirm the role of these proteins in phage-induced biofim destructuring are in progress with the hope to set the foundation of new anti-biofilm strategies.
