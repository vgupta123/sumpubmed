BACKGROUND
the mammalian accessory olfactory system  functions as a detector for chemical signals  concerning social organization and conspecific reproductive status  <cit> . the vomeronasal organ  is the primary sensory organ for the aos. in rodents, the vno is an encapsulated neuroepithelium containing a lumen and is able to aspirate fluids via a vascular pump  <cit> . vomeronasal sensory neurons  express vomeronasal receptors  belonging to one of the two families of g-protein coupled receptors  specific to the vno, the v1rs and v2rs  <cit> . upon binding of a chemosignal, v1rs and v2rs activate the g-proteins, gαi <dig> and gαo, respectively  <cit> . g-protein activation can ultimately result in a non-specific cation current through the canonical transient receptor potential channel type  <dig>   <cit> .

vno function is dependent upon trpc <dig>  <cit> . adaptor proteins scaffold trpc to proteins such as inositol  <dig> ,5-trisphosphate receptor type  <dig>   <cit> . in the invertebrate retina trp is in a scaffold-mediated complex whereby deletion of the scaffold leads to complex degradation and altered light responses  <cit> . the trp channel and ip <dig> receptor are co-localized in vsn microvilli  <cit>  whereby peptide disruption of the protein-protein interaction between them inhibits chemosignal-induced currents  <cit> .

homers are adaptor proteins that bind to proline-rich sequences on proteins associated with calcium signalling  <cit> . long homer isoforms  contain, whereby the immediate-early gene encoded short isoform  lacks, a coiled-coil motif that mediates multimerization  <cit> . homers alter the function and distribution of metabotropic glutamate receptors   <cit> .

trpc <dig> clones have poor surface expression in vitro and may require a chaperone for proper formation  <cit> . receptor transporting protein  <dig>  and receptor expression enhancing protein  <dig>  are putative transmembrane protein chaperones expressed in the main olfactory system, which target olfactory gpcrs to the membrane and form protein-protein interactions with olfactory gpcrs in vitro  <cit> . rtp <dig> and reep <dig> mrnas are expressed in the mouse vno, but as of yet, neither protein has been reported in vsns, and have not been proposed to have any functional interactions with vomeronasal gpcrs  <cit> .

given the role of trpc <dig> in chemosignal detection, the interactions of trpc <dig> with adaptor proteins in other sensory systems, and chaperone mrna expression in the vno, we sought to test the hypothesis that trpc <dig> forms protein-protein associations with partners that could alter channel function or localization. specifically, we sought to identify interactions between trpc <dig> and homer family members and interactions between trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> or reep <dig>  first, we demonstrate vno protein expression of rtp <dig>  homer, and trpc <dig>  next we describe novel, in vivo, interactions between trpc <dig> and homer 1b/c as well as trpc <dig> and rtp <dig>  lastly, we demonstrate a physiological role for the interaction between rtp <dig> and trpc2; in vitro co-expression of rtp <dig> with trpc <dig> leads to increased cell-surface expression of functional trpc <dig> 

RESULTS
homer, rtp <dig>  and reep <dig> are expressed in the vomeronasal organ
trpc <dig> forms a protein-protein interaction with ip3r <dig> in rat vsns  <cit>  and a peptide blocker of this interaction functionally reduces odor-activated currents  <cit> . we therefore questioned whether adaptor proteins might moderate the scaffold complex. rat vno tissue was screened with an antiserum that recognized all homer isoforms . pan-homer antiserum was observed to label proteins at the predicted molecular weight via sds-page followed by western analysis on np40-solubilized tissue extracts from the hippocampus , cerebellum , cerebral hemisphere , olfactory bulb , and vomeronasal organ  . only long forms  were detected using the pan-homer antiserum, presumably because the short form of homer  is a transient product of an activity-dependent immediate early gene  <cit> , making detection difficult. the commercial pan-homer antiserum , and not the investigator-generated antisera  , produced a non-selective band at  <dig> kda, and therefore was not utilized in subsequent biochemical analyses.

isoform-specific antisera were then utilized to further probe which homer isoforms were predominantly found in the vno. homer 1b/c and homer  <dig> were expressed in all neural tissues tested including the ob and the vno . repetition of sds-page and western analysis using the same tissue extracts as in fig. 1b resulted in no immunoreactive labelling with preimmune serum used to generate the homer 1b/c antiserum . homer  <dig> was weakly detected in the vno, but was found in the ob, as well as other brain regions tested . in our previous studies we have noted sexual dimorphism in the vno  <cit> , therefore, male and female vno lysates were separately probed with homer antisera. an appreciable sex difference was not consistently detected . equal protein loading was confirmed for all western blots by stripping the blot and then re-probing for actin immunoreactivity .

rtp <dig> and reep <dig> mrnas have only been demonstrated in the mouse  <cit> , therefore rat vno cdna was screened using gene-specific primers and reverse-transcriptase pcr  for chaperone expression. rtp <dig> and reep <dig> expression in the rat vno is reported in fig. 1f. each rt-pcr reaction produced a single band and the identity of the band was confirmed by sequencing. an additional screening of rtp <dig> in the mouse main olfactory epithelium was also performed across various postnatal stages as reported in additional file  <dig>  fig. s <dig> 

since rtp <dig> cellular localization has not been previously explored in the olfactory system, the determination of the cells or cellular processes that express rtp <dig> was made using immunoctyochemistry . coronal sections of the rat nasal cavity containing both the vomeronasal and the main olfactory epithelium  were incubated with an antiserum for rtp <dig> . using an avidin-peroxidase chromagen method, putative rtp <dig> immunoreactivity was evident in the rat moe cilia , vno microvilli , goblet cells , and the soft palate . higher resolution micrographs of the moe cilia and vno microvilli can be seen in figs. 2c and 2e, respectively. rtp <dig> immunoreactivity was absent from all other structures including the respiratory epithelium  and from the vno microvilli that were processed without primary antiserum . to determine whether the labelling of rtp <dig> might overlap with previous trpc <dig> microvillar localization reported by our laboratory and others  <cit>  we used dual-colored icc with fluorescently-tagged secondary antisera to test for co-localization of trpc <dig> and rtp <dig>  as shown in figs. 2g-i, the signals for the two proteins extensively overlap at the microvilli  as evidenced in the merged image overlay . omission of primary antisera eliminated the fluorescent signal in each condition tested . as an additional control for rtp <dig> antiserum specificity, human embryonic kidney  <dig>  cells were transfected with an rtp <dig> expression vector and then processed under non-permeabilizing conditions for rtp <dig> immunoreactivity. pre-incubating the cells with proteinase k abolished the rtp <dig> immunoreactivity .

homer and rtp <dig> form protein-protein interaction with trpc2
previous in vitro data have demonstrated that trpc <dig> and homer  <dig> form a protein-protein interaction  <cit> . our discovered co-localization of trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> suggests that these proteins may also bind in vivo. to test the rigor of potential protein-protein interactions, reciprocal co-immunoprecipitations were performed in native rat vno lysates . trpc <dig> was clearly immunoprecipitated with both homer 1b/c  and rtp <dig> . interestingly, homer 1b/c could co-immunoprecipitate with both ip3r <dig>  and trpc <dig>  additional negative controls using rabbit sera as the first source for immunoglobulins failed to produce bands at the expected molecular weight . protein interactions with reep <dig> could not be investigated due a lack of available antiserum.

trpc <dig> transfection efficiency in a heterologous expression system
due to the reported increased surface expression of olfactory receptors by the chaperone rtp <dig>  <cit>  and our discovery of its interaction and cellular co-localization with trpc <dig>  we hypothesized that the chaperone would increase the surface expression of trpc <dig>  to test this, trpc <dig> was expressed with or without either rtp <dig> or reep <dig> in hek <dig> cells. transfected cells were incubated with an antiserum for the myc-epitope tag on the plasmid-encoded trpc <dig> and then visualized using a species-specific fitc-conjugated secondary antiserum. a representative field of view used to calculate the transfection efficiency for various transfection conditions is shown in fig.  <dig>  the ratio of fluorescent cells  over that of all cells  was used to calculate transfection efficiency for each condition, respectively . trpc <dig> transfection by itself  and in conjunction with either rtp <dig>  or reep <dig>  resulted in an efficiency near 30% . transfection with another myc-epitope tagged six transmembrane spanning ion channel  was used as a positive control . the trpc <dig> transfection condition efficiencies were significantly below that of the positive control as measured by a one-way anova followed by a student newman-keuls  post-hoc test . neither cells transfected with empty vector nor those labelled without the primary antiserum were immunoreactive .

rtp <dig> alters the subcellular localization of trpc <dig> in vitro
rtp <dig> and reep <dig> are able to induce membrane expression of olfactory receptors in hek <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we sought to visualize the effect of these chaperones on the subcellular distribution of trpc <dig> in the hek <dig> cells. the identical transfection scheme as in fig.  <dig> was repeated but high-resolution images of the labelled cells were acquired using confocal microscopy. the results of three such experiments are shown in fig.  <dig>  when expressed alone, trpc <dig> immunoreactivity is visualized either near the nucleus  or in dense patches seemingly away from the surface membrane  and more easily viewed in an unstacked image . in contrast, kv <dig>  immunoreactivity is visualized primarily at the surface membrane  and is known to insert into the surface membrane in large numbers in hek <dig> cells. interestingly, co-expression with rtp <dig>  results in immunoreactivity that is more typical of surface expression, with less immunoreactivity near the nucleus , than that observed for the trpc <dig> alone condition. co-transfection with reep <dig> results in an intermediate distribution . transfection of hek <dig> cells with trpc <dig> and both chaperones did not appear different than that of cells using transfection conditions with only one chaperone in conjunction with trpc <dig> . cells labelled without the primary antiserum were not immunoreactive . line plots of each transfection condition in fig. 5a-e demonstrate the α-myc immunoreactivity distribution.

to biochemically confirm the suggested increase in surface expression of trpc <dig> by rtp <dig> and reep <dig>  a set of cell-surface biotinylation experiments were conducted on hek <dig> cells transfected as in fig.  <dig>  the biotinylated surface proteins were collected and processed by sds-page and visualized via western analysis using an antiserum to the myc-epitope. cell lysates were also processed by sds-page and visualized via western analysis for β-actin to confirm equivalent protein loading. a representative western blot of biotinylated trpc <dig> channel is reported in fig.  <dig> as quantified  <dig> hrs following transfection in register with subsequent functional physiological experiments below. rtp <dig>  but not reep <dig>  significantly increased trpc <dig> surface biotinylation . when transfected alone, surface trpc <dig> was detected in only  <dig> out of  <dig> trials; while when transfected with rtp <dig>  surface trpc <dig> was detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> trials. comparatively, myc-tagged kv <dig>  was strongly detected under either condition .

cell-surface trpc <dig> is functionally detected
to confirm that the cell-surface expressed trpc <dig> was functional, a set of whole-cell electrophysiological experiments were conducted on hek <dig> cells transfected as in fig.  <dig>  dynabead technology using co-transfection of the channel with cd <dig> was employed to pan for transfected cells appropriate for whole-cell patch-clamp . transfected hek <dig> cells that were lightly beaded  and apparently exiting mitosis were targeted in order to facilitate the generation of consistent, comparable recordings across several transfections. cells were stimulated with a voltage-ramp protocol as described in  <cit>  and graphically displayed in fig. 7a. the total duration of the ramp was  <dig> ms with an interpulse interval of  <dig> s. three to five ramp pulses were applied to determine baseline current and then the recording bath was changed  to yield a final atp concentration of  <dig> μm. although diacylglycerol  has been reported to activate endogenous trpc <dig> channels in mouse vsns  <cit> , in our hands neither dag nor a synthetic analogue, oag, was effective in gating trpc <dig> current in vertebrate vsns  <cit> . we therefore relied upon reported augmentation of trpc <dig> via activation of purinergic current  <cit>  as the metric of a functional assay of our in vitro system. current at the end of the voltage-ramp protocol  was used as a measure of response to atp stimulation. as shown in fig. 7c, cells transfected with both trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> elicited an increase in atp-evoked whole-cell current compared to that of control cells that were transfected, but beadless  or trpc2-transfected only cells  . additionally, a different population of heavily-beaded cells  were observed, which had much larger voltage-activated current amplitudes that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> pa . these cells were minimally responsive to atp  and were only observed in dishes transfected with both trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> 

discussion
these experiments demonstrate that the putative olfactory receptor chaperone rtp <dig> interacts with not only proteins of the gpcr superfamily, but also with ion channels. this novel finding was demonstrated in vivo by a protein-protein interaction between trpc <dig> and rtp <dig>  and in vitro by a rtp1-dependent increase in trpc <dig> surface expression. an ion channel complex consisting of trpc <dig>  homer, and ip3r <dig> may exist in vivo. our biochemical experiments indicate that trpc <dig>  the scaffold protein homer 1b/c, and the ion channel ip3r <dig> form protein-protein interactions in the native vno. to the best of our knowledge, an interaction between homer and trpc <dig> has not been demonstrated in any sensory system. lastly, our data represent the first characterization of homer expression in the rat vno.

homers are widely expressed in both the male and female rat including, but not limited to, many brain regions and the testes. although these biochemical data cannot exclusively rule out the possibility of homer expression in non-sensory regions, homers are typically associated with either post-synaptic membranes  <cit> or membranes involved in calcium signalling  <cit> . the vno lysates used in these experiments contained both of these subcellular elements, consistent with previous expression patterns for homer. the non-sensory portions of the vno are densely innervated by the autonomic nervous system  <cit>  and the sensory microvilli contain a well-explored calcium-signalling pathway   <cit> . homer isoforms expressed in the vno could function similarly in smooth muscle cells and in chemosensory signal transduction. unlike mouse data reported by  <cit> , we do not find homer  <dig> expression in the rat vno. overall, we detected neither a sex difference in vno expression of homer 1b/c and  <dig> isforms nor an appreciable amount of the homer  <dig> isoform.

our data demonstrating transcription of rtp <dig> and reep <dig> in the rat vno support the previous finding of these transcripts in the mouse vno  <cit> . the fact that our immunocytochemical characterization supports the detection of rtp <dig> protein in olfactory sensory neuron cilia, vsn microvilli, goblet cells and in the soft-palate while rtp <dig> is not detected in the non-sensory respiratory epithelium, may provide important clues as to function. in vitro experiments support rtp <dig> interactions with gpcrs associated with either odorant  <cit>  or taste receptor families  <cit> . similar protein-protein interactions have not been found, however, with vrs  <cit> .

alternatively, mhc class 1b proteins have been found to associate with the v2rs and thus may not function with trpc <dig>  <cit> . allowing for several different protein associations including m10-vr, rtp1-trpc <dig>  and homer-trpc2-ip3r <dig> provides the pheromone transduction cascade with multiple regulatory sites .

the immunoprecipitation data indicate that homer is not expressed in the non-sensory areas of the vno, rather it is expressed in vsn microvilli. other data have indicated that trpc channels can interact with homer proteins  <cit> . for example, trp  is involved in such interactions in the invertebrate photoreceptor  <cit> . functionally, homer expression in the vsn would allow for receptor and channel modulation. linking trpc <dig> and ip3r <dig> via homer  <dig> would ensure high-fidelity transmission of the calcium signal that flows through the open trpc <dig> channel during chemosignal detection. homer  <dig> does not form protein-protein interactions with trpc <dig>  <cit> . the inducible form of homer  was not detected in the rat vno. this short form lacks the coiled-coiled domain and would oppositely be predicted to disassemble a trpc2-homer 1-ip3r <dig> complex . disruption of this interaction could alter trpc <dig> activity in a manner similar to homer 1a modulation of mglur activity  <cit> . in previous vsn recordings, disruption of the interaction between trpc <dig> and ip3r <dig> resulted in a diminished chemosignal response  <cit> . on the other hand, trpc <dig> mutants lacking homer binding sites formed spontaneously active channels when expressed in vitro  <cit>  and gene-targeted deletion of homer  <dig> increased trpc <dig> activity in vivo  <cit> . thus, homer  <dig> could provide the vsn signalling apparatus with flexibility in responding to and adapting to chemosignals. the interaction between trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> could provide further regulation of trpc <dig> and the response of vsns to chemosignals, by modulation of total trpc <dig> activity dependent upon surface expression driven by the chaperone. the recognition sequence for rtp <dig> binding will need to be investigated in future experiments.

the plasmid containing trpc2-c <dig> had a low transfection efficiency in hek <dig> cells. transient transfection of a plasmid containing kv <dig>  produces an efficiency percentage of approximately 60%  <cit> , whereas trpc <dig> efficiency is only about 30%. poor transfection efficiencies have been noted of some constructs using polycationic transfection reagents  <cit> ; however, other researchers have tried alternative transient transfection methods with trpc <dig> and reported comparably low efficiencies  <cit> . it is interesting to speculate that the low transfection efficiency might be a result of apoptosis due to calcium cytotoxicity associated with spontaneously active trpc <dig> channels. at least one other trpc channel, trpc <dig>  has been demonstrated to be spontaneously active in hek <dig> cells  <cit> . in light of the facts that neither chaperone increased trpc <dig> transfection efficiency nor did this efficiency match that of kv <dig> , a structurally similar channel  <cit> , suggests that proper trpc <dig> cellular distribution and function may require binding partners not present in our experiments. lastly, rtp <dig> and reep <dig> do not appear to be toxic to the hek <dig> cells, as transfection efficiency did not decrease with their expression.

rtp <dig> and reep <dig> appear to alter the sub-cellular distribution of trpc <dig> in vitro. in hek <dig> cells, trpc <dig> immunolabeling is predominately in large deposits that are presumably vesicles, as imaged with laser confocal microscopy. although every transfection condition with trpc <dig> led to vesicular immunolabeling, the presence of either rtp <dig> or reep <dig> seemed to shift expression of the channel toward the surface membrane. these data indicate a functional relationship for the rtp1-trpc <dig> co-immunoprecipitation found in vno tissue. our data cannot distinguish the mechanism of trpc <dig> surface expression, which could be the result of either increased trpc <dig> inserted or inhibition of trpc <dig> internalization.

demonstration of robust kv <dig>  surface expression lends credence to the assumptions made earlier when comparing sub-cellular localization of trpc <dig> in different transfection conditions. namely, when transfected with chaperone, the trpc <dig> immunolabeling signal was similar to the kv <dig>  immunolabeling in terms of subcellular distribution. a similar shift in the immunolabeling signal of olfactory receptors occurs when these receptors are expressed in vitro with rtp or reep  <cit>  and with unrelated gpcrs  <cit> . it then follows that with the addition of chaperone, more trpc <dig> is in the surface membrane. in support of this notion, in each transfection condition where trpc <dig> and rtp <dig> were transfected together, trpc <dig> was detected in the surface membrane. when expressed alone, trpc <dig> was infrequently detected in the surface membrane. increased trpc <dig> surface expression was detected with both cell-surface biotinylation and with whole-cell electrophysiology.

the endogenous metabotropic atp receptor pathway utilized in our experiments to investigate in vitro trpc <dig> current is similar to the vno sensory transduction pathway as each activates plc   <cit> . the electrophysiological data indicate that the surface expressed trpc <dig> is functional and able to respond to a signal transduction pathway similar to that present in the vno. that heavily-beaded, and presumably highly expressing, trpc2+ rtp1+ cells were minimally responsive to purinergic stimulation is not unexpected. trpc <dig>  another trpc channel, gains and loses agonist-induced activity based on expression level  <cit> . alternatively, the trpc <dig> protein level may have been high enough and the purinergic receptor protein level low enough, that any interaction between the two might be negligible due to stoichiometric limitations.

regardless of the mechanism, these data suggest that the half-life residence of trpc <dig> in the membrane is increased in the presence of rtp <dig>  these results may indicate that the functional interaction between rtp <dig> and trpc <dig> is one of membrane stabilization rather than trafficking. this is a different functional role for rtp <dig> from previously described  <cit>  and is speculative. with both olfactory and gustatory gpcrs, rtp <dig> is presumed to traffic its target to the surface membrane  <cit> .

based upon our current results in the context of current knowledge  <cit> , we propose the following model . a chemosignal binds to either vr-type gpcr, activation of which ultimately results in a trpc2-dependent calcium influx across the surface membrane. calcium can also enter the cytosol from the endoplasmic reticulum via ip3r <dig>  homer  <dig> binding at either trpc <dig> terminus  <cit>   may alter the channel function. trpc <dig> and mglurs are both integral transmembrane proteins and, therefore, the known interactions of mglur/ip3r  <cit>  could be replaced by trpc2/ip3r complex formation in the vno. for example, homer  <dig> may cluster ip3r <dig> to trpc <dig> using homer binding motifs  on both channels in a similar fashion that homers cluster ip3r <dig> to mglur  <cit> . this would be advantageous for at least two reasons. first, the products of phospholipase c hydrolysis of pip <dig>  ip <dig> and dag, gate both ip3r <dig> and trpc <dig>  maintaining close proximity of the second-messenger targets would increase the speed of the signalling cascade and decrease the amount of second-messenger lost due to errant diffusion. second, as ip3r <dig> may adopt a conformation that favors opening upon calcium binding  <cit> , tethering ip3r <dig> next to the calcium source would increase the speed of the signalling cascade. by tethering ip3r <dig> underneath trpc <dig>  homer would be expected to increase the open probability of ip3r <dig> using calcium influx contributed through the surface channel trpc <dig>  thus, homer could both increase the speed and the efficiency of the trpc <dig> signalling cascade as it does for mglur cascades. signal adaptation is likely to come from calcium-calmodulin inhibition of both ip3r <dig>  <cit>  and trpc <dig>  <cit> , calcium-activated big conductance potassium channels   <cit>  and metabolism of dag into the lipid arachidonic acid  <cit> .

although complexes of channels and adaptors have been found in the visual system, homer is a relatively newly discovered protein, and appears to be involved in scaffolding, targeting, and localization. our previous finding of a direct protein-protein interaction between ip3r <dig> and trpc <dig> in the vno neither ruled out an additional role for scaffolding proteins, such as the homer family, nor a role for chaperones, such as reep <dig> and rtp <dig>  in fact, the addition of chaperones and the formation of an adaptor complex may be critical to channel function and eagerly warrants future experimentation.

CONCLUSIONS
the vno expresses members of the homer protein family. trpc <dig> complexes with both ip3r <dig> and homer1b/c in vivo in the vno. rtp <dig> is expressed in the vno, co-localizes with other members of the vno transduction pathway and may be a member of the transduction pathway as it forms a protein-protein interaction with trpc <dig> in vivo. in vitro, rtp <dig> appears to function as a chaperone of trpc <dig>  increasing the amount of functional channel in the surface membrane.
