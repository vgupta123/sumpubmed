BACKGROUND
poly-aps bioactivities and transfection
polymeric  <dig> -alkylpyridinium salts , have been isolated from water soluble extracts of the marine sponge reniera sarai. the preparation contains a mixture of oligomeric and polymeric alkylpyridinium compounds but two primary polymeric compounds, one of  <dig>  kda and one of  <dig>  kda are predominant . poly-aps are amphipathic molecules expressing both a hydrophilic cationic head group of pyridinium rings and hydrophobic hydrocarbon chains. the existence of dualistic domains within single molecules critically determines their behaviour in aqueous solution and bio-activity  <cit> .

in aqueous solution poly-aps above their critical micelar concentration form irregular spherical aggregates with a mean radius of  <dig> nm  <cit> . these consist of multiple polymer structures that may form active units of poly-aps. however, most of the observed actions are activities of single polymers since in biological assays the concentration used are well below their critical micelar cencentration. poly-aps have a number of bio-activities such as anticholinesterase activity  <cit> , haemolysis  <cit> , and cytotoxicity,  <cit>  and many of their actions can be attributed to poly-aps forming pores in membranes.

electrophysiological recordings from cultured dorsal root ganglia  neurones indicate that poly-aps and related sponge toxins  collapse membrane potentials and input resistances. these effects result from increases in membrane ionic permeability and reduced ability of cells to maintain electrochemical gradients  <cit> . in the case of poly-aps this pore formation is reversible in most drg neurones when concentrations below  <dig> μg/ml were used  <cit> . this is consistent with data from a previous study by berlinck and colleagues who showed that halitoxin from amphimedon viridis blocked crutacean nerve action potentials but that partial recovery could be obtained in some experiments  <cit> .

due to the reversible nature of the pores formed by poly-aps at low μg/ml concentrations, it has been possible to exploit these pores experimentally. for example the transfection of hek  <dig> cells with cdna plasmids for enhanced green fluorescent protein and human tumour necrosis factor receptor  <dig> has been achieved  <cit> . additionally, the pore formation and macromolecule delivery is enhanced at 12°c compared to 21°c. these findings indicate that pore formation but not endocytosis is a requirement for efficient macromolecule delivery  <cit> .

it is of great interest that synthetic "poly-aps like" monomers and oligomers have been produced. these compounds express one or more pyridinium rings ranging from monomers to tetramers, and varying hydrocarbon chain length . some bio-activities of these synthetic compounds, including: antibacterial, haemolysis, cholinesterase inhibition and to a lesser extent protein phosphate 2a inhibition, have already been characterised. in particular these compounds show some correlation between the length of the polymer  and functional activity  <cit> .

in this study we have aimed to characterise and compare the pore-forming properties of poly-aps and four synthetic compounds using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurones and evaluate the potential for intracellular macromolecule delivery into cns neurones by any of the compounds.

RESULTS
acute electrophysiological actions of poly-aps on cultured hippocampal neurones
low-pressure ejection of  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps collapsed membrane potential from a resting level of - <dig> ±  <dig> mv to - <dig> ± mv . this effect was accompanied by suppression of action potential firing evoked by + <dig> pa current step commands and reductions in electrotonic potentials evoked by - <dig> pa current step commands . under control conditions -100pa current step commands evoked a mean hyperpolarising electrotonic potential of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv, which equated to a mean input resistance of  <dig> ±  <dig> mΩ. after application of poly-aps for  <dig> minutes, the mean input resistance was significantly reduced to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mΩ . adjusting for the reduction in membrane potential using constant current injection, resulted in an input resistance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mΩ, which was not significantly different from non-adjusted values .

prolonged intracellular recordings revealed a variable timeline of pore reversibility and cell recovery from poly-aps . in one example neurone, approximately  <dig> minutes after application of poly-aps, a partial recovery of membrane potential and input resistance was observed . prior to poly-aps application the resting membrane potential was - <dig> mv and the input resistance was  <dig> mΩ. after  <dig> minutes application of poly-aps, resting membrane potential and input resistance fell to - <dig> mv and  <dig> mΩ respectively, before recovering to - <dig> mv and  <dig> mΩ. however, injection of + <dig> to + <dig> pa current step commands failed to elicit action potential firing. whilst this indicates some reversibility in the membranes ionic permeability, it suggests that suppression of action potentials firing is not solely due to the collapse of input resistance but may involve more prolonged inactivation of voltage-activated channels and loss of electrochemical gradients. figure 2d shows a record of the onset of the response to brief application of  <dig>  μg/ml of poly-aps and the development of recovery after membrane potential and input resistance collapse. preliminary data , indicated that if cultures were exposed to poly-aps  and then returned to culture conditions for  <dig> hours at least some neurones recover and have the ability to fire action potentials when stimulated .

to further characterise the actions of poly-aps, neurones were voltage clamped at potentials between - <dig> and - <dig> mv in the absence and presence of the natural product preparation. figure  <dig> shows the linear current-voltage relationships generated under control conditions and in the presence of poly-aps. leak subtractions of linear leak current and capacitance were performed to generate values for the net poly-aps activated-currents. these showed a linear correlation with voltage of r <dig> =  <dig>  ±  <dig> , a mean slope conductance of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ns. a mean reversal potential of  <dig> ±  <dig>  mv  for the poly-aps-activated current was obtained from individual experiments by plotting difference current -voltage relationships and identifying the point at which the linear relationship crosses the x-axis .

the poly-aps-evoked currents displayed typical properties of non-specific cation currents resulting from permeation of the cell membrane.

electrophysiological response to application of synthetic alkylpyridinium compounds
each synthetic alkylpyridinium compound was applied to cultured rat hippocampal neurones at one of two concentrations and attempts were made to maintain similar numbers of pyridinium rings in the different solutions applied . from a holding potential of - <dig> mv the monomer and dimer, sample  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, evoked only small non-uniform transient inward currents. the peak current amplitude of events induced by sample  <dig> were < - <dig>  na in size, with duration of <  <dig> ms. sample  <dig> induced transient inward currents at a lower frequency, but with varying amplitudes ranging from between - <dig>  na and - <dig> na, with a greater duration lasting approximately  <dig> ms . these currents were recorded within the first few seconds of application of the test compounds but inward current activity stopped with persistent application of the test compounds.

the larger synthetic compounds, tetramers  <dig> and  <dig>  both produced more sustained inward currents and evoked action currents of - <dig>  to - <dig> na . in contrast, the inward currents evoked by samples  <dig> and  <dig> rarely evoked regenerative action currents and did not produce the high frequency discharge activity. although poly-aps produced the largest and most sustained inward currents, they suppressed evoked action potential firing and did not support spontaneous action potential discharges .

the actions of the synthetic compounds on current-voltage relationships  were also investigated. samples  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  were tested at concentrations of  <dig> and  <dig> μg/ml.

firstly, we compared the net currents evoked at a holding voltage of - <dig> mv, the mean data for all samples are shown in figure  <dig>  poly-aps  evoked a highly significant increase in holding current while application of sample  <dig> at  <dig> μg/ml did not significantly alter the holding current. under control conditions the mean holding current was - <dig> ±  <dig> pa compared to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa  in the presence of sample  <dig> . at  <dig> μg/ml sample  <dig> also did not alter the mean holding current at - <dig> mv . sample  <dig> at  <dig> μg/ml also did not significantly alter holding current . sample  <dig>  the tetramer compound and structurally most like poly-aps, also did not change the holding current when tested at  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml . however, sample  <dig> produced a significant decrease in holding current when applied at  <dig> μg/ml. the holding current decreased from a mean control value of - <dig> ±  <dig> pa to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa . similarly, at  <dig> μg/ml sample  <dig> also decreased holding current from - <dig> ± 34pa to - <dig> ±  <dig> pa .

secondly, we considered the actions of the samples on current-voltage relationships between - <dig> and - <dig> mv. comparative responses produced by the different samples were statistically analysed using a 2-way anova test and comparing individual sample responses against controls at corresponding voltages. application of poly-aps at  <dig>  μg/ml produced a significant effect on the current-voltage relationship , which is described in figure  <dig>  the bonferroni post test revealed significant increases in holding current at all clamped potentials .

when applied at  <dig> μg/ml, sample  <dig> produced significant effects on the current-voltage relationship that were evident at - <dig> mv. the post-test confirmed a modest but significant increase in holding current at - <dig> mv . similarly, sample  <dig> tested at  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml also produced a modest but significant increase in the slope of the current-voltage relationship . however, sample  <dig> at  <dig> μg/ml produced no change in the current-voltage relationship . in contrast, sample  <dig> tested at  <dig> μg/ml showed a modest but significant decrease in the slope of the current-voltage relationship between - <dig> and - <dig> mv . the synthetic compounds tested showed modest or no significant sustained effects on the linear current-voltage relationship under voltage clamp. in summary, despite subtle transient changes in holding current, none of the synthetic samples produced currents of the magnitude and duration as those evoked by poly-aps , even when the synthetic samples were applied at  <dig> times the concentration of poly-aps.

intracellular ca2+ imaging analysis of the ca2+ transients evoked by poly-aps and the synthetic compounds
poly-aps were applied in sequential ascending concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml. the responses recorded from hippocampal neurones showed that poly-aps transiently increased intracellular ca2+. however, poly-aps produced a variety of distinct concentration response relationships. three distinct poly-aps response profiles can be seen in figure 6a. in most neurons observed  the amplitudes of the intracellular ca2+ transients increased with increasing poly-aps concentrations. however in a second group with low sensitivity, responses were only seen to the highest concentration  of poly-aps. a third group of neurones responded to  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps but not to the lowest or intermediate concentrations. when data from all cells were pooled the poly-aps induced ca2+ rise displayed a concentration-dependent response relationship. at concentrations of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps produced  <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig>   <dig> ±  <dig> and  <dig> ±  <dig> % increase in ca2+ relative to baseline levels . significant increases in intracellular ca2+ levels were observed when comparing responses to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps with responses to  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml , and  <dig>  μg/ml with  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml . analysis of responders revealed a poly-aps sensitive subpopulation of cultured hippocampal neurones, with  <dig> % responding to  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps and  <dig> –  <dig> % responding to the lower concentrations tested. this reflects a consistent threshold sensitivity to low concentrations of poly-aps in a subpopulation of hippocampal neurones. in most cases the same cells are responding to different concentrations of poly-aps. however, some cells that respond to low concentrations of poly-aps failed to recover preventing further analysis. the variation in response may be a result of a heterogenous population of neurons within the hippocampal cultures, whilst the majority of neurones are likely to be pyramidal cells it is also likely that various interneurones exist within the culture. differences in membrane lipid composition may alter the sensitivity of neurones to poly-aps. the synthetic compounds were also applied to hippocampal cultures and changes in intracellular ca2+ measured. similar to the electrophysiology results with the synthetic compounds, direct comparisons with poly-aps  were made based on using concentrations that contained equivalent numbers of pyridinium rings. poly-aps  were also applied after synthetic compounds to test for the sensitivity of the neurones. interestingly, only those neurones which responded to poly-aps, produced a ca2+ transient in response to application of the synthetic compounds. of these compounds, only samples  <dig> and  <dig> produced significant increases in intracellular ca2+ but samples  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> at  <dig> μg/ml all gave significantly smaller responses compared to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps . only  <dig> % and  <dig> % of neurones responded to  <dig> μg/ml and  <dig> μg/ml sample  <dig>  sample  <dig>  produced increases in ca2+ of  <dig>  % and  <dig> % compared to baseline levels. the increases in intracellular ca2+ evoked by sample  <dig>  were significantly smaller  compared to the mean response evoked by  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps . all the neurones that responded to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps also responded to  <dig> μg/ml of sample  <dig>  sample  <dig> at  <dig> μg/ml produced a  <dig> % rise in ca2+ relative to the baseline levels and gave a mean response of  <dig> % of that induced by  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps . figure  <dig> summarises the ca2+ imaging data and shows maximal responses to the synthetic samples compared to increases in intracellular ca2+ evoked by poly-aps.

dph fluorescence imaging
membrane fluidity was quantified using the lipophilic fluorescence probe  <dig> -diphenyl- <dig>   <dig>  5-hexatriene . initial levels of dph fluorescence within the membrane are dependent upon the ratio of lipids, cholesterol and proteins within the bilayer. insertions of molecules into the membrane that are lipophilic increase the fluorescent signal and indicate a more fluid membrane environment. however, insertion of non-lipophilic molecules that can form lipophobic or hydrophilic regions in the membrane may make the membrane more rigid and decrease the lipid density  <cit> . this results in a reduced dph fluorescence indicative of a reduction in membrane fluidity .

application of poly-aps in order of ascending concentration,  <dig>  to  <dig> μg/ml, produced transient reductions in dph fluorescence, the magnitudes of which increased with higher concentrations . when applied at  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml, poly-aps decreased fluorescence by  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> % respectively. the response to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps was significantly lower than that produced by  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps . the responses to poly-aps appeared to display a straightforward dose-dependent relationship. however, when applied in order of descending concentrations , poly-aps produced cumulative responses . both  <dig>  and  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps produced significantly different decreases in fluorescence, depending on the sequences of application. poly-aps  decreased fluorescence by  <dig> % and  <dig> % when applied in ascending and descending order . in contrast,  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps decreased fluorescence by  <dig> % compared to  <dig> % when applied in ascending and descending orders .

surface plasmon resonance data for poly-aps
surface plasmon resonance  is a method that uses changes in light reflection off a metal surface coated with a target ligand to detect binding and dissociation of a test analyte. when analyte is associated with the ligand, it alters the refractive index which can be measured and used to determine the time course of association and dissociation. in this study we have used spr to detect interactions between surface-immobilized cholesterol/sphingomyelin lipid vesicles and poly-aps. given our previous results and anomalous dose-response relationships we were particularly interested in determining whether poly-aps have a reversible association with lipids.

spr sensorgrams corrected for bulk effects, displaying the association-dissociation kinetics of poly-aps interaction with cholesterol/sphingomyelin  large unilamellar vesicles  immobilized on l <dig> chip, are shown in fig.  <dig>  increasing kinetics during the association phase  was observed with increasing concentrations suggesting dose-dependent behaviour. however, the binding of poly-aps did not reach the equilibrium during the  <dig>  min application period. approximately 80% of the signal persisted during the dissociation step, indicating that a considerable amount of poly-aps remained irreversibly inserted or attached to the lipid bilayer. moreover, successive injections of poly-aps produced a accumulative binding effect. for example, the binding signal obtained after successive treatment of the bilayer with  <dig> doses of  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps was enhanced by 40% in comparison with the first injection over the freshly deposited luvs . these repeatedly observed effects indicate that poly-aps molecules already present in the membrane can enhance further binding of poly-aps, and support the data obtained with calcium imaging and dph .

discussion
the electrophysiological actions of  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps on cultured hippocampal neurones were consistent with pore formation by the sponge toxins and are similar to the effects previously seen in hek <dig> cells and drg neurones  <cit> . additionally, we again observed that within any of the populations of cultured cells there was a considerable variability in sensitivity to poly-aps. in the cases of drg and hippocampal neurones this may be explained by the heterogeneous nature of the cultures, but some variability is also observed in hek <dig> cells. for example, considering evoked ca2+ transients in hippocampal neurones,  <dig> % of neurones responded to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps but this value only increased to  <dig> % when a  <dig> fold higher concentration was used. although all hek  <dig> cells responded to  <dig> μg/ml poly-aps there was great variability in the threshold sensitivity to this natural compound  <cit> . additionally, there is also a large degree of variability in the currents and ca2+ transients evoked by poly-aps. this may relate to the compositions of plasma membranes providing varying access and/or numbers of binding sites for the polymeric units to interact with. in this study we have also revealed a level of variability in poly-aps responses  that related to previous exposure to the natural product. one interpretation of the findings is that poly-aps polymers do not fully wash out of membranes but membrane re-modelling takes place to facilitate repair but disrupt pores. a consequence of this would be that poly-aps molecules already within the membranes influence the responses produced by subsequent reapplication of poly-aps. this may account for the complex dose-response relationships seen in this study that depended on the order of application of different concentrations of poly-aps.

recovery of hippocampal neurones from both electrophysiological responses and in some cases ca2+ transients evoked by poly-aps was slow and often incomplete. faster  and greater levels of recovery  were seen in drg neurones exposed to  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps  <cit> . this may be due to variations in ca2+ homeostasis in different neurones and predisposition to ca2+ induced excitotoxicity. however, preliminary data suggests that  <dig> hours after exposure to poly-aps, at least some hippocampal neurones show normal electrophysiological properties and fire action potentials.

activity of synthetic compounds
although polymeric alkylpyridinium compounds may be useful as transfection reagents and for intracellular delivery of macromolecules, there are clear hurdles that restrict progress. to date research concerning these natural metabolites has focused on the isolation from marine sponges of natural products as cocktails and not on single pure compounds. purification of individual polymeric alkylpyridinium compounds from nature has proved problematic because of availability and variability of materials and the complex nature of the mixtures that may contain tens of molecules with similar molecular weights and related structures  <cit> . additionally, poly-aps for example might be improved on because they have recently been found ineffective for the intracellular delivery of sirna  <cit> . ideally, total synthesis of defined pure alkylpyridinium polymers would be a way forward. although making large polymers by an efficient and controlled synthetic sequence remains a goal, a series of water-soluble monomers and oligomers, the later -as short "poly-aps-like" examples, have been made. analysis of chemical structure and bioactivity has suggested several factors that may influence the extent of membrane interaction including: 1) distribution of positive charges, 2) alkyl chain length and 3) numbers of pyridinium rings. these properties partially correlate with antibacterial properties. although sample  <dig> showed greater activity than the other synthetic compounds used in this study it also shows greater antibacterial activity than poly-aps  <cit> . in our study, higher levels of membrane perturbation were seen with sample  <dig> and to some extent with sample  <dig> compared with relative inactivity seen with samples  <dig> and  <dig>  action potential discharges and ca2+ transients evoked by sample  <dig> particularly reflected this. structural variation may account for the distinct sets of transient events evoked by the synthetic compounds and may provide indications of extents of the compounds surface interactions resulting in the alteration of membrane charge separation through screening or capacitance changes. the transient nature of the events induced by sample  <dig> and  <dig> may indicate incomplete membrane interactions such as partial intercalation rather than pore formation. whilst the more prolonged disruption of holding current induced particularly by sample  <dig> may indicate more stable interactions with membranes. interaction with specific membrane proteins such as ionic pumps and channels may also contribute to the initial small transient responses observed. in this study, sample  <dig> produced the more robust responses compared to sample  <dig>  yet they share very similar structural features, suggesting that the presence of additional functional groups on sample  <dig> inhibits membrane or protein interactions that lead to activity. in contrast to two of the synthetic compounds , poly-aps did not produce action potential discharges and actually suppressed action potential firing. this was most likely due to the larger decrease in input resistance, to a point where regenerative excitability is prevented.

considerable haemolytic activity was previously seen with poly-aps inducing lysis of bovine erythrocytes with an approximately  <dig> fold higher effect than compound  <dig>  <cit> . our data from cultured hippocampal neurones was consistent with the findings previously made by mancini et al. who have shown that haemolytic, antibacterial and anticholinesterase activities of alkylpyridinium compounds mainly increase with higher degrees of oligomerisation, numbers of positive charges and pyridinium rings  <cit> .

dph-membrane fluidity
analysis of the dynamic changes in membrane fluidity in response to poly-aps provided new insights into possible mechanisms of pore formation and cell recovery after pore formation. poly-aps decreased membrane fluidity but again showed complex dose-response relationships that were greatly influenced by the order in which different concentrations of natural product were applied. the cumulative type dose-response relationship may result from alkylpyridinium compounds remaining within the lipid membranes, even after the structure has recovered from pore formation. this was striking, when viewing the raised levels of membrane disruption produced by  <dig>  μg/ml poly-aps, applied after the neurones had been exposed to higher concentrations of pore-former. we speculate that poly-aps within the membrane that are not producing an increase in permeability provide either co-operative support for further interactions between membranes and poly-aps, or produce sites of membrane vulnerability. this increase in membrane vulnerability may relate to partial membrane repair and increased availability of poly-aps binding sites and thus prime the membrane for further poly-aps interactions. the preliminary spr data in the present study support these ideas and showed that a significant proportion of poly-aps remains in or bound to membranes after washing. furthermore the repeated application of poly-aps to membranes results in accumulation of associated poly-aps and that accumulation of poly-aps in membranes enhances further binding of poly-aps. the nature of this molecular interaction may have practical implications for the refinement of the transfection protocol utilising poly-aps, where successive applications of low concentration of poly-aps may prove less cytotoxic than a single application of poly-aps at higher concentrations.

CONCLUSIONS
poly-aps, a naturally occurring mixture of two polymeric alkylpyridinium compounds produces pore formation in cultured hippocampal neurones that can be identified and to some degree quantified using electrophysiology, ca2+ and dph imaging. however, related water-soluble synthetic compounds ranging from monomers to tetramers produced either no pore formation or modest changes in membrane permeability. over the time courses of the experiments conducted in this study it appears that the synthetic oligomers do not produce similar effects to poly-aps. the data indicate that larger synthetic oligomers with a greater degree of polymerisation than the synthetic molecules used in this study will be required to mimic poly-aps and potentially be useful for macromolecule delivery into hippocampal neurones. intracellular delivery of macromolecules via poly-aps-induced pores may still prove problematic because of the levels of recovery and the requirement for prolonged exposure to pore formers.
