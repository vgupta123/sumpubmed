BACKGROUND
large scale gene expression analysis with microarray technology is expanding and generating a large amount of high quality, publicly available data. in the present work we analyzed a dataset derived from monkeys infected by smallpox, published by rubins et al  <cit> . smallpox is a lethal disease that was endemic in many parts of the world until eradicated by a massive immunization program developed by the world health organization. its fatality rate was estimated to be 30%, and the survivors often had disfiguring scars  <cit> .

there are serious concerns about the use of smallpox as a bioweapon  <cit> . recently, some health care workers were vaccinated by the uk government for the analysis of antibody responses  <cit> . pox viruses display unique abilities to interfere with the host immune system, producing immune modulators  <cit>  and there are at least  <dig> viral genes involved in combating the host immune response  <cit> . the original study's goal was to analyze the evolution of the gene expression of the peripheral blood cells of variola-infected monkeys, so as to clarify the biological processes associated with host-pathogen interactions  <cit> .

among the important results was the absence of a tnf-α/nf-κb-activated transcriptional mechanism during systemic infection, which could suggest that variola interaction with the mammalian host immune system may be ablative to this response  <cit> .

given the importance of this dataset, we have analyzed the data with systems biology approaches considering the expression profiles of gene groups instead of individual genes. these approaches are more powerful, less vulnerable to common experimental variation and usually more advantageous for obtaining biologically meaningful results.

RESULTS
active modules
the goal of our analysis was to identify differentially expressed modules in monkeys with early death, i.e., died in the first three days, and monkeys with a later death . our hypothesis is that these modules play crucial roles in the host response to smallpox infection. the gene groups were defined according to the kegg database   <cit> , as described in the methods section.

initially, this analysis was based on the ed and ld monkey groups using all kegg orthology  categories , indicating three highly active modules in ld monkeys: cytokines and cell adhesion molecules , which are consistent with the classical model of immune and inflammatory responses, where an activation and proliferation of leukocytes take place. the alzheimer's disease module also appeared as differentially activated, most likely due to its hybrid composition .

in addition to the ed and ld analysis, modules were also analyzed during the disease course. we have found  <dig> modules presenting differential activation in at least one point . several of those modules are related to immune response, like cd molecules, cam ligands, antigen processing and presentation and the previously considered activated in a late death cytokines and cell adhesion molecules.

a novel finding highlighted by our systems biology approach for all macaques  was an altered expression in the natural killer  mediated cytotoxicity module. nk cells play a major role in the host-rejection of virally infected cells. due to their strong cytolytic activity and the potential for auto-reactivity, they are tightly regulated. the activation of nk cells requires the action of proinflammatory cytokines in combination with cell surface receptors  <cit> . under normal conditions, inhibitory nk cell receptors engage mhc class i  molecules. such inhibitory activity normally predominates over that provided by the activating receptors, which bind to ligands expressed on virus-infected and other stressed cells  <cit> . cells with normal levels of mhc-i are generally protected from nk cell-mediated lysis. virally infected cells often express reduced levels of mhc-i and this inability to engage the inhibitory receptors makes the cells susceptible to nk cell attack  <cit> . the down regulation of natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity module reported here could indicate a susceptibility to a nk cell mediated lysis .

the contributions of individual molecules for each significantly altered module are available in the additional material , represented by scores and the respective p-values.

relevance networks 
to understand the profiles of interaction between the genes of the groups studied, we used a procedure known as relevance networks , initially proposed by butte et al  <cit> . interaction here represents significant correlation between two variables , which may  physically interact with each other.

cytokines and cell adhesion molecules  modules were highly expressed in ld monkeys in the early phase of the infection  and were further explored in more detail by using the rn approach. a metamodule  was created to gain a better understanding of leukocyte migration to the infection locus. the connections between icam <dig> and itgav and itga <dig> shows a significant change  when comparing day  <dig> versus the earliest infection groups , see figure 2a.

to establish a successful infection, pox viruses affect the release of immune modulators by the infected cells, so it is crucial to understand the dynamics of the host immune system  <cit> . the population of the immune cells varies during the infection, as do their exposed membrane proteins. therefore, the relevance networks approach can reveal a more detailed perspective on the dynamics of the molecules involved in the disease. a better assessment of the variation of those molecules during the onset of the infection could give a better understanding of the host response to smallpox, and ultimately of what may be the key factors that set the 30% mortality rate.

to reach the infection focus and kill the pathogen, the immune cells have to adhere and overpass the endothelium. these events are possible due to the interaction between the integrins and the extra cellular matrix receptors and are modulated by cytokines. more specifically, esam is an endothelial cell adhesion molecule and itgav, itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> are integrins, which are heterodimeric integral membrane proteins composed of an alpha chain and a beta chain. itgav encodes an alpha chain; itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> encode beta chain integrins, known to participate in the cell-surface mediated signaling. icam <dig> is an intercellular adhesion molecule that promotes an inflammatory response and the activation of akt . akt phosphorylates components that block the apoptosis pathway  <cit> . to explore further the graphs produced by rns for the ecm receptors + cams the relations concerning icam <dig> and esam are detailed. the complete network is available in the additional material . rns of day  <dig> and days 1– <dig> show statistically significant alterations in the interactions between icam <dig> and the integrins itgav and itga <dig> , which are important extracellular matrix receptors, involved in the adhesion, migration, differentiation, survival and proliferation of cells and cytoskeleton organization. day  <dig> versus days 4– <dig> rns revealed a significant relation between icam <dig> and other molecules that play crucial role in immune response against pathogens, plxnc <dig>  <cit>  and cdh <dig>  <cit>  . the relevance networks produced for cytokine group is available in the additional material .

esam shows a strong relation with itgav, itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> with variable patterns along the time course of infection. the quartet of esam, itgav, itgb <dig> and itgb <dig> reveals the relationship between alpha and beta chains in the composition of integrins and the relation of such heterodimeric proteins with esam. it is worth mentioning that itgb <dig>  itgb <dig> and itgb <dig>  elements that interact with itgav, are present in the microarray platform design, but were excluded from analysis in the filtering steps .

active modules and the rns results pointed out drastic changes in the expression levels and interactions of important genes involved in essential cellular processes of the host response, such as cellular adhesion, apoptosis and immune response. these results constitute interesting new biological hypotheses about smallpox virus infection that could be further explored by expert virology groups.

overlapping with rubins et al and jahrling et al
the data analyzed in our manuscript was previously analyzed by rubins et al  <cit>  and jahrling et al  <cit> . the former focused on the microarray data and the later on the clinical findings. rubins et al  <cit>  reported the expression profile in ifn response, cell cycle/proliferation response, tnf-α/nf-κb regulated genes, dose response and lymphocyte and ig responses. meanwhile jahrling et al  <cit>  discuss the hemorrhagic diathesis, cytokines activation  and lymphocyte depletion.

rubins et al  <cit>  performed a detailed analysis of ifn response genes. the kegg module of cytokines includes il <dig>  il <dig>  ifn -α, -β and -γ, ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , tnf-α and nf – κb. the influence of each molecule in the modules activation was also computed . once kegg separates the molecules into functional classes, it is not possible to define cascading effects, like rubins et al did  <cit> . despite this fact, we manually compiled a module with the ifn-responsive genes detailed by rubins et al  <cit>  . for the ed and ld analysis, this module is significantly down regulated in monkeys that died early and up regulated in those which died later . in addition, for the time course analysis, the ifn-responsive module is down regulated for day  <dig> and up regulated for days 1– <dig> and inactive for the other days . therefore, our results suggest that activation of ifn-responsive genes may play an important role in a successful immune response upon infection, as previously reported by rubins et al  <cit> .

the decrease in the relative abundance of b cells and mhc ii reported by rubins et al  <cit>  are corroborated by the profile of module antigen processing and presentation . the cell cycle, complement and coagulation cascades, cytokines and hematopoietic cell lineage modules identified here were also reported by rubins et al  <cit>  as differentially expressed using gene by gene approaches.

altered d-dimer levels were interestingly investigated by jahrling et al  <cit> , which reflect the serious influence of smallpox virus inhibitors in the complement and coagulation cascades. our active modules are also in agreement with such findings. our results suggest an unbalanced cytokine levels, which is strongly associated with sepsis and organ failure death in infected animals.

in addition, we have also observed alterations in the hematopoietic cell lineage module which could be a consequence of the influx of immature leukocytes into the bloodstream, particularly neutrophils .

rubins et al  <cit>  observed a considerable depletion of t cells, and a large number of apoptotic cells in the splenic periarterial lymphatic sheath, possibly due to the viral replication in antigen presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, which could lead to apoptosis in the lymphocytes. the lysis of vulnerable cells induced by nk cells  and the down regulation of the nk cell mediated cytotoxicity module supports such hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
the usage of active modules pointed out the major role of the cytokines and ecm receptors in an effective host response. we have also pointed out that the population of the ecm receptors and cytokines significantly changes during the infection, possible due to a host response to eliminate the virus. in order to have a closer perspective of the dynamics of the molecules involved in this response we used the relevance networks. despite the need of an experimental validation of these new biological hypotheses, one of our goals was to exemplify and stress the importance of public microarray datasets analysis by using different and novel bioinformatics models and thus expand knowledge and information about important biological problems.
