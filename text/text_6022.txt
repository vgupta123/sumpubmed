BACKGROUND
anthropogenic factors contribute to increased rates of hybridization and introgression globally  <cit> . moreover, the growing pace of species introductions and habitat alterations suggests that this phenomenon will become even more common in the future  <cit> . global climate change is one of those anthropogenic factors that is expected to inevitably alter the prerequisites for many biota around the world  <cit>  and a potential outcome will be a change in the niche separation of species with adjacent boundaries on both large and small scales. in marine ecosystems, which display few absolute physical barriers to migration and gene-flow, contemporary contact between previously isolated species can occur across great distances, and in some cases, may be inter-oceanic  <cit> . consequently, the identification of changes in species and population complexes is essential to document, quantify, and ultimately understand the potential long-term evolutionary consequences of ecosystem changes.

minke whales represent a species complex in which it is possible to investigate how marine ecosystem changes can induce contemporary contact between genetically and geographically distinct species across the globe. based upon morphological  <cit>  and genetic data , this complex is thought to consist of two main species: the antarctic minke whale  present in the southern hemisphere, and the common minke , which is cosmopolitan. the common minke whale is thereafter divided into three allopatric sub-species: the north atlantic , the north pacific  and the dwarf common minke whale  in the southern oceans  <cit> . analyses of mtdna data indicate that the two species may have been established from a separation in the southern hemisphere approximately  <dig> million years ago and that the sub-species diverged from each other approximately  <dig>  million years ago  <cit> .

norway maintains an individual-based dna register  to enforce domestic regulation and compliance with the commercial harvest of the atlantic minke whale b. a. acutorostrata conducted in the ne atlantic  <cit> . this register contains genetic data corresponding to ten microsatellites and mtdna for the whales harvested during the period  <dig> till present, together with biometric information and the geographic position of the captures. in  <dig>  an antarctic minke whale was captured in the ne arctic  <cit> , which represents the first documentation of this species north of the equator, and serves as an example of a long distance and inter-oceanic migration. approximately one decade later, in  <dig>  the first hybrid between antarctic and atlantic minke whales was identified, like the previous migrant this specimen was also captured in the ne arctic  <cit> . in  <dig>  a second hybrid between these two species was also identified in the ne arctic  <cit> . significantly, this second hybrid was pregnant, and the genetic analyses of her normally developed fetus indicated that it had been sired by a common minke whale  <cit> . these observations confirm reproductive compatibility of hybrids between the antarctic and atlantic species of minke whale. occasionally, routine genotyping with the standard panel of microsatellite markers used in the nmdr reveals specimens displaying atypical genetic profiles, which could suggest mixed ancestry. although several of the microsatellite loci used are either fully or partially diagnostic among minke whale species and sub-species  <cit> , the markers do not give sufficient statistical power to resolve the ancestry of these specimens.

the above observations  provide a compelling time-line sequence of events. documented changes in the antarctic ecosystem  <cit>  and changes in the energy storage and diet opportunities of antarctic minke whales  <cit>  have led to speculation that antarctic minke whales may be undertaking contemporary migrations out of its native distribution in search of better feeding opportunities in response to ecological changes  <cit> . while the microsatellite loci upon which the nmdr are based provide considerable statistical power to identify migrants and f <dig> hybrids  <cit> , accurate characterization of individuals to various categories of hybrids and back-cross variants becomes increasingly challenging with subsequent generations. in order to investigate and follow-up the time-line of genetic contact between the minke whale species and sub-species as reported above, an improved set of markers is therefore necessary.

simulations have demonstrated that  <dig> or more fully diagnostic markers  are required to accurately identify f <dig> and f <dig> hybrids and multiple-generation back-crossed individuals  <cit> . recently, genomic resources for minke whales have become available  <cit> , and resequencing approaches to identify genetic markers  <cit>  and bioinformatic tools to identify such loci have also become readily available for non-model species. here, we used a combination of whole genome resequencing, snp identification pipelines, and a high throughput genotyping platform to identify and validate a set of species diagnostic snps that can be used to provide accurate identification of hybrids and back-crossed minke whales globally.

methods
samples
the samples used in the present study originate from two sources. dna from b. a. acutorostrata was obtained from the nmdr repository, using specimens from year classes  <dig> and  <dig> caught in the north-east atlantic. samples of b. bonaerensis were obtained during the jarpa  survey performed in the austral summer season 2004/ <dig> in international whaling commission  management area viw , south of 60°s. samples of b. a. scammoni were obtained during the jarpnii  survey performed in summer  <dig> in the western north pacific between the japanese pacific coast and 170°e, and between 35° and 50°n approximately. samples of b a. unnamed sub-species  were obtained during the jarpa surveys performed in the austral summer seasons 1987/88–1992/ <dig> in iwc management areas iv  and v , south of 60°s. all samples existed prior to this study.

sample preparation
dna from approximately  <dig> individuals from each of the three of the groups  was isolated using phenol-chloroform extraction. isolated dna was checked for size on agarose gels and for purity on a nanodrop spectrophotometer, and was quantified using a qubit quant-it kit from invitrogen. from each of the three groups,  <dig> samples considered to be of the highest quality  were evenly pooled into two biological replicates each for the three groups.

the b. a. acutorostrata and the b. a. scammoni pools were purified with genomic dna clean & concentrator  kit from zymo research, whereas the b. bonaerensis pools were purified by standard precipitation. the pools were subsequently checked for size, purity and quantity by the same method as the individual samples.

sequencing of pooled dna samples
all subsequent laboratory work was performed at the norwegian sequencing centre . library construction was done using illumina truseq adapter ligation. the dna was fragmented to a target size of 300 bp, and sequenced using an illumina hiseq  <dig> instrument, producing 2× <dig> bp paired-end reads. each pool was sequenced using one illumina lane and resulted in a pair of fastq files ranging from  <dig> to 50 gb in size .table  <dig> sequencing results, showing the number of sequences produced for each pool, and the result of mapping them to the reference genome sequence

dwarf minke whale sequencing
genomic dna was extracted from approximately  <dig>  g of the outer epidermal layer of the skin tissue of  <dig> dwarf minke whales using phenol–chloroform extraction. extracted dna was stored in te buffer .

dna sequencing was performed by the hokkaido system science co., ltd . the dna library was prepared with the truseq nano dna lt sample prep kit , following the manufacturer’s standard protocol. extracted dna was fragmented into c.a. 350 bps, and fragments with other sizes were removed using the provided sample purification beads. the adaptor sequences were ligated to each end of the fragments. the resulting dna library was sequenced using paired-end 100-bp reads on one lane of illumina hiseq  <dig> system . bcl2fastq v <dig> . <dig>  was used to demultiplex the data into individual samples based on the indexes used during the library preparation.

mapping and snp prediction
the b. a. scammoni genome reference sequence  <cit>  was downloaded from the bioftp.org website, and the sequencing reads were mapped to this reference, using bwa version  <dig> .5a  <cit>  using the “mem” mapping method with default parameters, and samtools version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the mapped sequences were processed using samtools mpileup with the -b options, and then varan  <cit>  was used with the -e option to tally the observed alleles and calculate the estimated information value  for each locus in the genome.

snp candidate selection strategy
for a snp to be highly informative for population or species identification, the difference in allele frequencies should be as large as possible. ideally, the snp should be fully diagnostic, i.e., fixed to different alleles in the different groups. in addition, snps should be independent of each other, avoiding correlation caused by genetic linkage. as exact chromosome location is not available, we depend on scaffold length to ensure maximum genomic distance between snps. finally, for practical reasons, snps should be taken from relatively stable parts of the genome, avoiding repeats and highly polymorphic regions, since this complicates both mapping and design of primers to produce high through-put genotyping assays downstream.

in order to satisfy these criteria, we used the following strategy to select putatively species-diagnostic snps from the genome:select snps from a set of the longest genomic scaffolds.

filter candidates on coverage, retaining only snps where coverage is within two standard deviations of the mean.

select remaining candidates based on observed allele frequency difference and confidence, using the expected snp information value   <cit> .




b. acutorostrata and b. bonaerensis species identification
based on the approach detailed above, the two candidate snp with loci with highest esiv scores were selected from each of the  <dig> longest genome scaffolds. these candidates were processed with the massarray® typer  <dig>  assay designer  software to produce snp primer multiplexes, suitable for the massarray® genotyping platform . in order to maintain maximal independence, when two loci from the same contig were produced, the locus with the lower confidence score was removed, and the multiplex was re-plexed in order to identify another suitable locus as a replacement.

b. acutorostrata subspecies resolution
in order to develop markers to distinguish between the three acutorostrata subspecies , a set of  <dig> candidate loci were selected for each subspecies, again selecting the two highest scoring loci from the  <dig> longest contigs. for sorting the candidate loci, the average of the esiv scores between the subspecies and the two other groups was used.

primer design
the massarray® typer  <dig>  assay design software  was used to produce all snp assays. using the default values in the software , and from the results, we selected  <dig> multiplex assays for the acutorostrata versus bonaerensis comparison , and one multiplex for each of the three sub-species comparisons .table  <dig> marker panel genotyping results. each assay contains between  <dig> and  <dig> usable markers, and  <dig> to  <dig> appear to be fully diagnostic – viz., we have not observed any presence of minor alleles in the two subspecies or populations. except for the dwarf subspecies, where the number of specimens is small, a 95% confidence upper bound for the minor allele frequency of an apparently fully diagnostic marker is between  <dig> and 4%

snp genotyping and validation of allele frequencies
snp genotyping was performed on a massarray® typer  <dig>  analyser  at the molecular genetics laboratory at the institute of marine research in bergen. this platform is based on pcr amplification of the different snps, and each snp in all multiplexes is detected in a high voltage vacuum, resulting in minute difference resolution, i.e. detection of two different fragments where only one nucleotide has been replaced. all data were analyzed and scored independently by two persons prior to exporting data to further analysis.

evaluation of the validated snps for species and sub-species identification
in order to evaluate the statistical effectiveness of the snps identified, two complimentary approaches were used. the first method is based on the observation that with fully diagnostic snps, only hybrids will display heterozygote loci, and if we consider only back-crosses into a homogenous, non-hybrid population, the number of heterozygotes will follow a binomial distribution. the second method performs a simulation using the observed allele frequencies in the species and sub-species, to estimate allele frequencies within the different hybrid and back-cross categories pair-wise, and thereafter examines the data using standard population genetics and genetic assignment tools . both methods are described in detail below.

first, we assessed classification from snp markers based on heterozygote counts. we considered three scenarios:  <dig>  assuming a panel of fully diagnostic markers without overlapping allele frequencies between the species,  <dig>  assuming a panel of partly diagnostic markers, where the nearly-diagnostic alleles occur at small frequencies in the alternative population , and  <dig>  assuming a panel of markers fully diagnostic in one direction, that is, where introgression migrants may have a small frequency, but where the loci are fixed  in the native population. the latter case appears to be particularly relevant for b. bonaerensis introgressing into the atlantic b. acutorostrata population. in this approach, we assumed that the identified markers were independent , and treated the problem as a binomial sampling case. the details for these classifications are provided in additional file  <dig> 

second, we used the population genetic and assignment approach based upon allele frequencies of whales in pre-defined categories . in short, this method involved producing in silico hybrids and various back-crossed whale combinations between b. acutorostrata and b. bonaerensis using allele frequency data from the genotyping results. back-crossed whales were developed in both directions. thereafter, the allele frequencies of the in silico developed hybrid and back-cross variants were compared against each other. first, a custom r script  <cit>  was used to simulate the putative genotype of hybrid offspring, based on the known genotypes of two pools of parents. the initial data consisted of the genotypes of  <dig> antarctic  and  <dig> atlantic  for  <dig> of the developed snp markers. the first set of simulations was used to generate  <dig> f <dig> hybrids between atlantic and antarctic minke whales. subsequently, the hybrids were iteratively crossed back with the original species to obtain reciprocal back-crosses as follows : the f <dig> hybrids were crossed back with the atlantic population to generate a first generation back-cross of antarctic in atlantic . reciprocally, the f <dig> hybrids were crossed back with the antarctic population to generate a first generation back-cross of atlantic in antarctic . then, individuals from f2a were crossed with the atlantic population to obtain a second generation back-cross of antarctic in atlantic , and individuals from f2b were crossed with the antarctic population to obtain a second generation back-cross of atlantic in antarctic . the procedure was repeated until the fourth generation of back-cross . thereafter, the accuracy of the assignment of simulated hybrids to their potential source was calculated by testing  <dig> hybrids against the baseline of  <dig> individuals distributed in eleven groups . this analysis was conducted with the program geneclass  <dig>  <cit>  using the rannala & mountain  <cit>  method of computation as well as with the conditional maximum likelihood based approach implemented in the software oncor . we also used the bayesian model-based clustering algorithms implemented in structure v.  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  to identify genetic clusters in the  <dig> individual baseline data set under a model assuming admixture and correlated allele frequencies both with and without using population information. in each case, ten runs with a burn-in period consisting of  <dig>  replications and a run length of  <dig> , <dig> markov chain monte carlo  iterations were performed for a number of clusters ranging from k =  <dig> to k =  <dig>  runs were automatized with the program parallel structure  <cit>  that controls the program structure and distributes jobs between parallel processors to significantly speed up the analysis time. we then used structure harvester to calculate the evanno ad hoc statistic Δk, which is based on the rate of change of the ‘estimated likelihood’ between successive k values  <cit> . each genotype was then assigned to the inferred clusters based of the individual proportion of membership  and its confidence interval . q-values and their corresponding 90% ci were averaged for each of the populations and plotted. structure runs for the most likely k were averaged with clumpp version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using the largekgreedy algorithm and the g’ pairwise matrix similarity statistics, and results were graphically displayed using barplots.fig.  <dig> outline of the simulated back-crossing, generating f <dig> hybrids, and subsequent back-crossed generations into the antarctic and atlantic pure species




RESULTS
summary of the identified markers
as described above, five panels of putatively diagnostic snps were produced. these snps were thereafter validated by genotyping the described samples . an overview of this validation is given in table  <dig> . since no dna samples from dwarf minke were available for snp genotyping, genotypes for these  <dig> individuals were estimated from the individually-tagged sequencing data. the sequencing data from dwarf minke showed none of the snp minor alleles found in the other groups. concluding that the snps are diagnostic for this group is premature, however, since using the same data for snp prediction and for testing incurs a selection bias. in addition, the data is based on fewer individuals, further reducing confidence in such a conclusion. thus, the likelihood for the existence of undetected minor alleles  is much higher for dwarf minke than for the other species and subspecies.

some of the snps designed to separate b. bonaerensis and b. acutorostrata  were not completely diagnostic in the samples used for validation. in all cases, this was caused by a very low presence  of the b. acutorostrata alleles in the b. bonaerensis specimens. a greater genetic diversity within b. bonaerensis is to be expected, due to the greater population size of this species, and the result is consistent with previously reported results based on microsatellites  <cit> .

some of the snps failed to amplify in some of the specimens, and thus the actual number of individuals genotyped varied per snp and per species. the number of individuals successfully genotyped per snp ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> for b. a. scammoni samples,  <dig> to  <dig> for b. a. acutorostrata, and  <dig> to  <dig> for b. bonaerensis. using the agresti-coull approximation  <cit> , we found that even for snps where no minor allele was observed, the 95% confidence interval for the minor allele frequency was from  <dig> to between  <dig>  and  <dig> %.

the dwarf minke is considered to be a member of the common minke species  <cit> . examining marker panel wp <dig>  we found that the dwarf data matched the b. a. acutorostrata allele for  <dig> snps, the b. a. scammoni allele for  <dig> snps, and for two of the snps we found both alleles present. the separation is here by snp, not by individual, so this appears to be the result of the dwarf minke constituting a separate sub-species with genetic similarities with both the b. a. acutorostrata and the b. a. scammoni sub-species.

identification of hybrids and back-crossed whales from heterozygote counts
from the observed number of heterozygotes, the ancestry of individuals were estimated using maximum likelihood. table  <dig> summarizes the results of this analysis, further details are provided in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  under realistic minor allele frequencies, f <dig> and f <dig> hybrids are correctly identified in almost all  cases. while f <dig> and f <dig> generations will be correctly identified in most of the cases , they will occasionally be misidentified, mostly as a more remote back cross. the accuracy of identification depends on assumptions about the minor allele frequencies for the snps, as can be seen from table  <dig>  the worst case presented here  is likely to be overly pessimistic.table  <dig> classification intervals, giving the range of heterozygote marker counts leading to fn classification under different assumptions of allele fixedness, and the probability of the classification of the specific back cross generation being correct, using a maximum likelihood model

note that with minor allele frequency of  <dig> , there is no number of heterozygote markers where the f <dig> generation is most likely to produce, and thus we will never classify a specimen as f <dig>  the same holds for f <dig> and above under all assumptions of minor allele frequencies.




although maximum likelihood assignment is a simple approach, it ignores the prior probability of observing the different generations of hybrids. an argument could be made that a bayesian assignment would be more accurate, but this is conditioned on the availability of good priors. assuming a constant population and no fitness advantage or disadvantage for the mixed ancestry individuals, we would expect a doubling in the number of specimens for each generation - i.e., each migrant will be the parent of two f <dig> hybrids, who in turn are parent to four f <dig> hybrids, and so on. there is little evidence that supports the assumptions underlying this model. if migration is indeed driven by recent changes to climate and ecosystems, a typical generation time for minke whales of 15– <dig> years  <cit>  means that we are unlikely to see hybrids further back than three or four generations.

our current understanding of the minke whale indicates a relatively small number of b. bonaerensis migrants introgressing into b. acutorostrata  <cit> . in this situation, hybrids are likely to continue to back-cross with b. acutorostrata, until only a small remnant of the introgressed genes remain in each individual. we have therefore emphasized this scenario in our analysis above.

if two hybrids should happen to interbreed, we expect to see homozygote markers specific to both ancestor populations . if this occurs at an early enough generation, it should be easy to detect, for example, for the offspring of two f <dig> hybrids , we would expect 25% homozygote markers matching each ancestral population. similar to the situation for identifying an f <dig> back-cross, we have a  <dig> % chance of at least three homozygote markers from each ancestral population, thus revealing the mixed ancestry. for the offspring of two f <dig> back-crosses, we expect the marker fractions to be  <dig>  homozygote to the local population,  <dig>  heterozygote, and  <dig>  foreign homozygote. in this case, a presence of foreign homozygote markers would reveal the mixed heritage, but in an expected 4% of the cases, no such markers are produced, and the individual would be misclassified as an f <dig> or f <dig> back-cross.

identification of hybrids and back-crossed whales using genetic assignment
the program structure distinctly showed two main clusters between the simulated hybrids and back-crosses between b bonaerensis and b. a. acutorostrata . a clear gradient of admixture between these two species was apparent from these in silico established crosses . the degree of admixture using popinfo prior was notably lower than the one found when this option was disabled. the 90% confidence intervals around the averaged qi per population were narrower for the popinfo option . hence, under popinfo, the only simulated hybrids that were impossible to differentiate due to overlapping confidence intervals were f <dig> from f <dig> and f <dig> from f <dig>  whereas all the remaining combinations were distinguishable . without popinfo, some overlaps add to the aforementioned ones: bon vs. f5b, acu vs. f5a, and f <dig> vs. f <dig> . the assignment of individuals to pure species or hybrid categories depends upon a trade-off between the accuracy and the efficiency in the assignment. when using structure, the relatively stringent posterior probability threshold of  <dig>  minimizes the number of misidentified pure species individuals while maximizing the efficiency of assigning hybrids . thus, the highest efficiency, i.e., the highest proportion of correctly classified purebreds and hybrids, is achieved with a threshold q-value of  <dig> . however, when accuracy, i.e., the proportion of true purebreds or true hybrids in each the purebred or hybrid groups, was considered in addition to efficiency, the threshold q-value of  <dig>  resulted in 6% higher performance. following this rationale, the threshold of  <dig>  < q <  <dig>  is the most widely utilized in the literature dedicated to the assessment of hybridization . however, in our case this threshold is too wide to allow the differentiation between pure species  and f <dig> and f <dig> backcrosses as, even with no popinfo, our threshold for hybrids would be  <dig>  < q <  <dig> .fig.  <dig> structure barplot for the baseline individuals : inferred ancestry of individuals was calculated after averaging ten structure runs with clumpp at k =  <dig> using a) popinfo, and b) without popinfo. acu stands for the atlantic b. acutorostrata and bon for the antarctic b. bonaerensis

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, we have used a combination of whole-genome re-sequencing, snp detection pipelines, high through-put genotyping, and statistical methods to identify, validate and demonstrate the identification power of a suite of species-diagnostic snps within the minke whale species and sub-species complex. most of the putatively diagnostic markers, identified from sequencing, were demonstrated to be fully or nearly diagnostic among the various species and sub-species combinations. collectively, these markers permit highly accurate identification of species, sub-species, f <dig> hybrids, and back-crossed whales in this species-complex. it is also likely that additional mining of the sequence data developed within this project will provide identify diagnostic markers if required. given the fact that minke whales have shown atypical inter-oceanic migrations in recent years  <cit>  and that hybrids between these species appear to be fertile and may therefore breed across currently accepted species boundaries  <cit> , the snps developed here, in addition to the available reference data sets that we have made publicly available, will provide the international community with the ability to investigate the movements and genetics of this species complex in all regions of the globe.
