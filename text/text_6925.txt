BACKGROUND
wood constitutes one of the most important natural resources on earth, and is a potential future alternative to fossil energy resources. wood is the end product of secondary vascular system  development, and is mainly composed of fibers and tracheary elements with secondary cell walls  <cit> . four major processes are involved in wood formation: cell expansion, secondary wall biosynthesis, lignification, and programmed cell death. recent advances in the understanding of these processes have revealed that wood formation is under highly regulated genetic control  <cit> . in recent years, genomic approaches have become the primary techniques for exploring wood formation. large est databases have been generated from different tissues of poplar  <cit> , black locust  <cit> , and loblolly pine  <cit> . meanwhile, transcriptional profiles have been revealed using cdna microarrays of wood-forming tissues of pine  <cit> , black locust  <cit> , eucalyptus  <cit> , and poplar  <cit> . these studies have demonstrated that hundreds of genes are involved in wood formation.

most previous work in this area has investigated genes that are differentially expressed between stems and other organs or among different wood-forming tissues, lacking information on the changes in gene expression that occur during different stages of wood formation. in particular, genes expressed only at transitions between different stages are likely to control the entire process of wood formation. the regeneration of the poplar svs, developed in our laboratory  <cit> , which mimics the initiation and differentiation of cambium cells into vascular systems, provides an opportunity to follow key stages of wood formation by sampling clonal trees at different regeneration stages. in this work, cdna microarrays derived from a subtractive library of cdnas of cambium zone versus leaf were used to analyze the genes that show different transcript levels during the different stages of svs regeneration. our results show that this approach provides an efficient way to identify dynamically expressed genes that are likely to be involved in the control of svs development in poplar.

RESULTS
regeneration of the svs in p. tomentosa
the regeneration processes observed were similar to those described in our previous work  <cit> . briefly, cambial zone was peeled off with the bark, leaving a few layers of immature xylem on the surface of the girdled trunk. at  <dig> days after girdling , the immature xylem ray cells near the surface had divided, forming callus. discontinuous meristem cells were observed at  <dig> days ag at the remaining immature xylem, and at  <dig> days ag, nearly continuous, flat meristem cells in an irregular arrangement  were observed. at  <dig> days ag, the flat meristem cell layer had increased in size and formed a vascular cambium with a continuous and regular layer, consisting of fusiform initials and ray initials. the newly formed cambium was observed to be differentiating at  <dig> days ag. large numbers of xylem cells and phloem cells derived from the cambium zone were observed at  <dig> days ag, and a normal wood-forming structure had completely regenerated. additional file  <dig> shows the process of svs regeneration.

construction of a cambium zone-specific cdna subtractive library and production of cdna microarrays
to generate a cdna library enriched in cambial zone-specific genes, the ssh technique was chosen because it equalizes the representation of both rare and abundant transcripts. cdnas were prepared using total rnas isolated from pools of cambium tissue and immature leaves of three trees in a clonal plantation to minimize possible individual variations. more than  <dig>  positive clones were obtained from the subtractive library, and  <dig>  clones with inserts of at least  <dig> bp in length were selected after amplification of the inserts. the  <dig>  fragments were pcr-amplified and spotted onto poly-l-lysine coated slides to produce cdna microarrays.

cdna microarray analysis of transcriptional profiles during svs regeneration
probes prepared from different regeneration stages, at  <dig> days ,  <dig> days ,  <dig> and  <dig> days ,  <dig> and  <dig> days , and  <dig> days  ag, were hybridized to the cdna microarrays. the transcript levels of different genes  during the adjacent regeneration stages were compared, and  <dig> genes displayed different transcript levels . in total,  <dig> genes were found to be up- or downregulated during svs regeneration  after redundant genes  were removed. larger numbers of genes were up- or downregulated on days  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ag than at other points, indicating that the transcript levels changed dramatically at these key switches between regeneration stages .

the above  <dig> genes were functionally classified into nine groups , including transcription factors , genes related to signaling and stress , cell wall synthesis , cell cycle regulation and cell division , cytoskeleton , photosynthesis , metabolism , other functions , and genes whose functions are unknown  or that produced no hits . the transcriptional patterns of these genes during the different regeneration stages are outlined in fig. 2b.

at the key switches of svs regeneration , the expression of genes encoding transcription factors, signaling, cell wall-associated proteins, and proteins with unknown functions exhibited highly dynamic changes , in accordance with the key regeneration stages of the initiation, formation, and differentiation of vascular cambium and xylem development . interestingly, a large number of the genes  classified as "no hits" showed altered transcript levels during svs regeneration, suggesting that these genes are only present in trees and might play important roles in wood formation. additional file  <dig> summarizes the selected genes with changed transcript levels and their dynamic transcriptional profiles during svs regeneration that are discussed in this paper, including genes encoding transcription factors, signaling pathway molecules, enzymes involved in metabolism or cell wall biosynthesis, and "unknown" factors.

compared to previous results  <cit>  of transcriptional profiles of wood formation from different svs tissues,  <dig>  of the  <dig> genes obtained in our study shared the same accession number in arabidopsis as described in the previous study, and  <dig>  were identical or similar to a gene description of the previous study. however, the other  <dig>  were not shared by the two studies, and had neither the same accession number nor the same gene description.

we compared the  <dig> putative genes from microarray data with the  <dig> proteins previously obtained during the svs regeneration using a proteomic approach  <cit> , and  <dig>  of the genes shared the same or similar function with the counterparts. notably, genes encoding transcription regulators , transcription factors , heat shock proteins , and lignin biosynthesis enzymes  were found in both studies, and the involvement of some of these genes in the regeneration of svs is discussed further . the relatively low number of genes shared by these two studies could have been due to the limitation regarding the total number of genes found by these two approaches, as well as differences in gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels.

validation of cdna microarray data by real-time pcr
the cdna microarray analysis provided a global view of the dynamic transcriptome of wood formation. to further verify the data, the transcript levels of ten genes  at different regeneration stages were analyzed by real-time pcr . similar transcription trends were obtained using the two methods, although the extent of accordance for the transcript levels of a given gene varied. for instance, the microarray data showed that the gene s <dig> was strongly transcribed at the stage of differentiation of the cambium into the xylem , and the same transcriptional pattern was obtained by real-time pcr. the similar trends of the transcriptional dynamics obtained by both cdna microarray analysis and real-time pcr suggest that the transcriptional profiles of these genes during regeneration are generally reflected by the microarray data.

discussion
to identify essential genes that play important roles in wood formation, an efficient approach is to characterize genes that are expressed at key switches of svs development. we used cdna microarrays and our previously established svs regeneration system to identify genes that are preferentially expressed at the key switches of the svs regeneration process. similar to the results of our previous proteomics study  <cit> , this work found that the transcript level also changed dramatically at these key switch points, at which the anatomy, structures, and functions of the cells change with the appearance of new types of cells and tissues. more than 67% of the genes we identified had the same function description as in a previous work by hertzberg and coworkers  <cit> , verifying the results and further confirming their involvement in wood formation. however, a large number of the genes  were only identified in our study. this could have occurred because the previous study  <cit>  only analyzed the transcriptional profiles in the cambium zone and immature and mature xylem, whereas we analyzed the transcriptional profiles following the dynamic process of svs regeneration, allowing us to obtain genes with more dynamic changes in transcript levels or those that are only strongly transcribed during the transitions. for instance, the gene encoding the ag <dig> protein precursor  was only transcribed strongly at  <dig> days ag, when the differentiation of cambium into xylem was beginning, and was transcribed at low levels during the other stages.

in the early stages of svs regeneration, meristem cells appeared at  <dig> days ag, possibly from dedifferentiated immature xylem cells; the cells then increased in number by cell division and finally had formed continuous cambium-like layers at  <dig> days ag. at  <dig> days ag, a vascular cambium had formed as a continuous and regular layer. during this process, several genes encoding transcription regulators , primary cell wall-associated proteins, and proteins of unknown function were up- or downregulated, indicating their functions in cell differentiation and meristem formation. pinhead was upregulated only at the stage of initiation of meristem cells, and was downregulated after  <dig> days ag . in arabidopsis, pinhead is expressed in the vasculature, and the development of shoot apical meristems is abnormal in the pinhead mutant. the pinhead gene should encode a component of a hypothetical meristem-forming competence factor and may play a role in primary meristem initiation  <cit> . we hypothesize that the strong expression of pinhead triggers certain cells to dedifferentiate into meristem cells at  <dig> days ag, and is no longer needed when the nearly continuous cambium-like layers have formed. therefore, pinhead may be involved in cambium initiation rather than cambium maintenance. recent advances have shown that several plant growth regulators, including auxin  <cit> , cytokinin  <cit> , brassinosteroid  <cit> , and proteoglycan  <cit> , regulate the development of svs as signaling substances. a radial concentration gradient of auxin forms across the cambium region in the aspen stem and is related to secondary xylem development  <cit> . mutations in several auxin response factors  or auxin -induced proteins disrupt the normal body organization along the apical-basal axis and result in discontinuous and reduced vascular formation  <cit> . an iaa-induced gene  is expressed at  <dig> days ag, suggesting that the auxin-activated expression of iaas regulates the transcription of genes involved in cambium formation.

the genes expressed in the cambium zone were revealed by a cdna array analysis employing the microsectioning technique, and marker genes for cambial initials , phloem , and xylem mother cells  were found, with totals of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes, respectively  <cit> . in contrast, in our study, the initiation of cambial cells, rather than maintenance of the stem layer in the normal cambial zone sampled in the previous study, could be traced, allowing us to obtain a large number  of up- and downregulated genes involved in the transition from callus cells to stem cells. in addition, considerable numbers  of these genes were of unknown function, indicating they might be novel genes that play roles in this process. nevertheless, nine genes in our data were found that had the same  or a similar  function description as the nine counterparts  in peakset  <dig> for cambial initials, suggesting that these genes are important for both the formation and maintenance of the stem layer; therefore, further investigation into their roles in cambial activity is warranted. similarly, our svs regeneration system identified genes expressed during the differentiation of stem cells  into these mother cells and the maintenance of their identity, and  <dig> such genes  in our data had the same or similar function description as markers in peaksets  <dig> and  <dig> in the previous study  <cit> . however, we could not partition these dynamically transcribed genes into phloem and xylem mother cells as in the previous study due to the limitation of our regeneration system in which these two types of cells appeared at nearly the same time. in summary, we studied the temporal expression of genes involved in cambial activity, whereas the previous work  <cit>  emphasized genes that are spatially expressed across the cambium zone. in addition, both studies found common genes of interest that play roles in this process. combining these two experimental systems to comprehensively profile the genes that are spatially and temporally involved in svs development by employing whole-genome poplar chips should provide valuable results.

in the later stages of svs regeneration , the newly formed cambium zone began to differentiate, and finally a normal wood-forming structure was completely regenerated. genes encoding myb-family proteins  and several small heat shock proteins   were either up- or downregulated. a promoter analysis of genes that encode enzymes associated with lignin biosynthesis revealed that ac elements are necessary for xylem-localized gene expression  <cit> . in eucalyptus, egmyb <dig>  a member of the r2r3-myb family, can bind to the promoters of the egccr and egcad <dig> genes, which contain ac elements, and regulate their transcription  <cit> . the thickness of the secondary cell wall of transgenic tobacco plants overexpressing egmyb <dig> was dramatically increased and the lignin profile was altered, suggesting that egmyb <dig> is a positive regulator of both lignin biosynthesis and secondary wall formation in xylem  <cit> . arabidopsis undergoes secondary growth in roots, hypocotyls, and stems under certain conditions  <cit> . the transcriptional profiling of induced secondary growth in arabidopsis showed that several myb transcription factors regulate the activities and differentiation of xylem and phloem  <cit> . our results showed myb-family genes transcribed at high levels at  <dig> and  <dig> days ag , revealing that certain myb proteins are involved in the regulation of xylem development.

interestingly, during the regeneration process, rare genes encoding enzymes involved in lignin biosynthesis were found to differ at the transcript level, except for genes encoding 4-coumarate:coa ligase   and cinnamate 4-hydroxylase  . however, the expression of genes associated with cell wall biosynthesis and assembly, such as extensins and expansins, changed dramatically, reflecting the transitions of cell types during this regeneration process but without large changes in the chemical composition of the cell walls. since our cdna microarray was prepared from a cambium zone-specific subtractive library, and the regenerated tissues mainly included cambium, immature xylem, and a small amount of phloem, lacking secondary cell wall deposition, the expression of most of the genes associated with lignin biosynthesis was not extensively observed.

small hsps, induced by gibberellins or methyl jasmonate, play roles in plant growth and development  <cit> , including wood formation  <cit> . the transcripts of several small hsps  changed dramatically at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> days ag in our study, indicating that small hsps are highly involved in cambium differentiation and xylem development. in addition, several genes of unknown function were strongly transcribed at key switches of the regeneration process, suggesting their potential roles in svs regeneration. the transcript levels of genes encoding the p0510c <dig>  protein at  <dig> days ag were 12- to 37-fold higher than at  <dig> days ag, and the high transcript levels persisted through the regeneration process. at  <dig> days ag, the transcription of the p0510c <dig>  gene  was significantly stronger than at  <dig> days ag. these proteins of unknown function might be important players in wood formation. the transcription of numerous genes encoding these hsps and unknown proteins was found to be highly dynamic during this process, and it would be interesting to further elucidate their roles in wood formation.

CONCLUSIONS
to understand the molecular mechanisms that occur during the development of the svs, further efforts should be focused on characterizing the functions of these strongly and dynamically transcribed genes to investigate their roles in wood formation. these studies should include the identification of the target genes of pivotal transcription factors, demonstration of the aforementioned hierarchical network of transcriptional regulation, elucidation of the modes of interaction between signaling molecules and transcription factors, and exploitation of different types of data related to posttranscriptional, translational, and posttranslational genetic control.
