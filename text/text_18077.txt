BACKGROUND
cotton  is one of the most economically important crops and provides the largest renewable source of material for the textile industry. cotton fiber is a single-cell trichome derived from the epidermal cells of the ovule, and its morphogenesis is comprised of four overlapping developmental stages: initiation, elongation, secondary wall thickening, and maturation  <cit> . after initiation on the day of anthesis, single-celled fibers undergo rapid elongation  and secondary wall deposition , followed by maturation into spinnable fibers  <cit> . one of the most significant features in fiber development is that the rate of fiber elongation and the length of the mature fiber are much greater than those commonly observed for plant cells; the cotton fiber is likely the fastest growing and the longest single cell in higher plants  <cit> . thus, the cotton fiber is an excellent model in which to study the molecular mechanisms of plant cell elongation without the interference of cell division and multicellular development. over the past decade, a number of studies have reported that several important proteins, such as sucrose/k+ transporters  <cit> , sucrose synthase  <cit> , vacuolar invertase  <cit> , kinesin-like calmodulin-binding protein  <cit>  and calcium dependent protein kinase  <cit> , play critical roles in the process of rapid fiber cell elongation. in addition to calcium signal transduction, the important second messenger molecule h2o <dig> might function as a termination signal in cotton fiber cell elongation  <cit> . furthermore, recent pioneering experiments revealed that plant hormones play important roles in fiber elongation. genes involved in auxin and brassinosteroid  signaling are expressed at higher rates in g. barbadense than in g. hirsutum, and these expression patterns have been associated with the development of longer fibers  <cit> , while the overexpression of the gibberellin 20-oxidase gene  might promote the initiation and elongation of cotton fibers through the regulation of gibberellin  synthesis  <cit> . interestingly, many genes encoding these proteins and phytohormone-responsive factors might be potential targets for new types of small molecule mirnas.

small rnas , which range in size from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, can regulate gene expression at the transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional level  <cit> . in plants, there are two classes of endogenous srnas: small interfering rnas  and mirnas. endogenous sirnas consist of repeat-associated sirnas , trans-acting sirnas , and natural antisense sirnas . of these, tasirnas are in-phase-generated srnas that depend on the mirna-mediated cleavage of transcripts of tasirna genes for their production. both mirnas and tasirnas can trigger the cleavage of mrnas containing complementary sequences in plants. as a result, mirnas play fundamental regulatory roles in various aspects of plant development and adaptive responses to stresses, including plant organ development  <cit> , auxin signaling  <cit> , growth phase changes  <cit> , and disease resistance  <cit> . similarly, mirnas have also been implicated in the development of cotton fibers  <cit> .

a total of  <dig> mirna families, including  <dig> conserved and four novel mirna families, have been identified in developing cotton ovules using a high-throughput sequencing approach, which showed that the general repression of mirnas in fibers is associated with the upregulation of a dozen validated mirna targets that are highly expressed in cotton fibers  <cit> . another investigation into cotton fiber srnas has also identified more than  <dig> conserved mirnas, representing  <dig> families  <cit> . in our previous studies, we characterized the dynamic changes of cotton ovule mirnaomes during initiation, ranging from − <dig> to +3 days pre-/post-anthesis , and identified seven fiber initiation-related mirnas  <cit> . these studies explored the mirnas that are differentially expressed in the cotton ovules of wild type upland cotton and a fiberless mutant, and the results suggested potential regulatory functions for these mirnas in cotton fiber initiation. however, there have been no systematic studies of mirnas expressed during fiber rapid elongation, and the role of mirnas during cotton fiber elongation remains elusive. a total of  <dig> plant mirnas have been identified in the model species oryza sativa  and arabidopsis thaliana   <cit> ; however, only  <dig> mirnas from gossypium spp. have been registered in mirbase . it is obvious that there are many mirnas to be identified and much to learn about the specific roles of mirnas in cotton fiber cells. furthermore, the recently published genome sequence of the diploid cotton g. raimondii has facilitated the identification of srnas, particularly mirnas in this genus  <cit> .

in the present study, we performed high-throughput sequencing of cotton fiber srnas to identify novel and potential fiber elongation-related mirnas. four small rna libraries were constructed from cotton fibers sampled at four different time points from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, and more than  <dig> million short rna sequence reads were generated for each library. the comparative mirnaomic analysis revealed  <dig> novel mirnas and nine fiber elongation-associated srnas, including eight mirnas and one tasirna, in allotetraploid cotton fiber cells. the predicted targets of the nine srnas were experimentally validated and implicated in different cellular responses and metabolic processes, demonstrating the regulatory importance of mirnas and tasirnas in cotton fiber elongation. thus, this study advances our understanding of the important regulation of mirnas and tasirnas in allotetraploid cotton through the identification of new mirnas and a putative mirna-mediated regulatory network supporting cotton fiber cell elongation.

RESULTS
high-throughput sequencing data overview
to identify new mirnas and potential fiber elongation-associated mirnas, four small rna libraries were generated from allotetraploid cotton fibers at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa and then subjected to illumina high-throughput sequencing. the obtained raw sequence reads  were computationally processed to remove low-quality reads, contaminated adapters and reads shorter than  <dig> nt, yielding more than  <dig>  million clean reads ; 21– <dig> nt sequences accounted for  <dig> % of the total clean reads . in the  <dig> dpa library, for example, the  <dig> nt reads were the most abundant class  and the  <dig> nt reads were the second most abundant class , followed by  <dig> nt  and  <dig> nt  reads. furthermore, the decrease in the percentage of  <dig> nt small rnas from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa implied roles for these  <dig> nt small rnas in cotton fiber elongation, although the roles need be studied further .

abased on the g. raimondii whole genome sequence ;

bthe number of reads includes the defined mature mirnas and their 2-nt mismatch variants;

ccontains all of the unclassified reads that potentially include new mirnas.

the clean reads were mapped to the diploid cotton g. raimondii genome, generating  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genome-matched reads from the  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa fiber libraries, respectively . these small rna reads were grouped into several rna classes, such as known mirnas, rrna, trna, snrna, snorna, protein-coding genes and repeats. the remaining unclassified small rna reads had the highest fraction of unique and total clean reads and likely included new types of regulatory small rnas and novel mirnas. for example, in the  <dig> dpa library, the unclassified small rna reads accounted for  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the unique and total clean reads, respectively .

known mirnas in elongating cotton fiber cells
currently, mirbase  lists just  <dig> mature mirna genes belonging to  <dig> mirna gene families as cloned or predicted to be expressed in cotton. based on our previous work,  <dig> new mirnas from cotton ovules were officially named by mirbase and included in the subsequent release  <cit> . to identify the known mirnas, the clean reads were subjected to a blastn search for known mirna sequences deposited in mirbase  and the newly identified cotton mirnas  <cit> . nearly  <dig> unique sequences of known mirnas belonging to  <dig> families were obtained from these four srna libraries . in addition to the  <dig> known cotton mirnas families in mirbase  and  <dig> mirnas families described in the previous study  <cit> ,  <dig> known mirna families were also identified based on their conservation in other plant species. in total, the  <dig> mirna families included not only nearly all the known mirna families previously identified in cotton  <cit>  but also all  <dig> mirna families that are conserved between eudicotyledons and monocotyledons  <cit> .

to accurately measure mirna read abundances, the abundances of known mirnas were normalized to reads per ten million . the four mirna families with the greatest abundance were  <dig> , 156/ <dig> , 165/ <dig> , and  <dig> , accounting for  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of all the known mirna reads, respectively. the mirna families  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  159/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 396-3p also exhibited average abundances of more than  <dig> rptm. in contrast, certain mirna families were expressed at low abundance . the varied abundances of the mirnas in different families suggested that these mirna genes are differentially transcribed during fiber elongation.

a total of  <dig> potential mirna gene loci, belonging to  <dig> mirna families, were identified based on the est sequences , genome survey sequences  and g. raimondii genome sequences using mireap_ <dig>  , comprising  <dig> of the  <dig> cotton mirna genes in mirbase . of the  <dig> potential loci,  <dig> originated from the g. raimondii genome sequence, including  <dig> of the  <dig> gossypium precursors deposited in mirbase ;  <dig> loci originated from cgi11; and six loci originated from gss, suggesting that many mirna genes with low expression were absent from the ests database  and that the g. raimondii genome sequences could be used for the analysis of mirna precursors identified in g. hirsutum high-throughput small rna sequencing . furthermore, as shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>   <dig> novel precursors of known mirnas  were identified.

of the  <dig> known families with precursors,  <dig> had mirna* sequences, providing evidence for a dcl1-processed stem-loop . as expected, the majority of mirnas showed dominant abundance of one arm of the stem loop, suggesting that the mirna* on the complementary arm was degraded quickly after biogenesis  <cit> . however, for mir <dig>  mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  similar numbers of 5p and 3p reads were observed. furthermore, mir160-3p and mir396-3p were even more abundant than mir160-5p and mir396-5p ; similar phenomena were also reported in a study of the small rnas in brassica napus <cit> .

the sequence of the most abundant mirna in each mirna family  is shown in the “sequence” column of additional file 1: table s <dig>  however, a subset of the representative sequences diverged among the different time-course small rna libraries . in fact, many known mirna families not only had multiple loci but also certain members that varied by few nucleotides . the mir <dig> , mir159/ <dig> , mir165/ <dig> , mir <dig> , mir169_ <dig> , mir169_ <dig> , mir <dig> , mir <dig> , mir <dig> , mir <dig> , mir <dig>  and mir7504b  families all contained more than two distinct members . the representative sequence of mir <dig> from 5– <dig> dpa was “ugaagcugccagcaugaucuca” and contained an adenylation modification at the 3’ end of the mature mirna compared to the representative sequence of mir <dig> shown in additional file 1: table s <dig>  this adenylation might protect the mirna from degradation  <cit> . hence, the presence of this highly abundant and stable form of mir <dig> might indicate a crucial role for mir <dig> in cotton fiber elongation. similarly, the representative sequences of mir <dig> and  <dig> differed between 5– <dig> dpa and  <dig> dpa. the representative sequences of mir <dig> and mir <dig> at 5– <dig> dpa were “agaauccugaugaugcugcag”  and “ucauugagugcagcguugaug” , whereas the representative sequences at  <dig> dpa were “agaaucuugaugaugcugcau”  and “uugagugcagcguugaugagc” , respectively. this observation suggested that the members of a known mirna family are expressed differentially during different stages of cotton fiber elongation.

newly identified mirnas in elongating cotton fibers
as shown in the analysis of known mirna precursors,  <dig> of  <dig> precursors originated from g. raimondii, indicating that the g. raimondii genome sequence could be used for exploring the novel mirnas from g. hirsutum high-throughput small rna sequencing. thus, after excluding srna reads homologous to known mirnas  in mirbase  and other annotated srnas , the remaining small rnas were mapped to the g. raimondii genome and subjected to a rigorous secondary structural analysis of their precursors. the precursors with a canonical stem-loop structure were further analyzed to ensure adherence to research community standards:  the set of reads from each candidate mirna locus should account for more than 95% of all the precursor-mapped small rna reads, and reliable candidate mirna reads  should account for more than 75% of the corresponding set of reads ;  the mirna* reads should have two-nucleotide 3’ overhangs; or  the base-paring mismatch between the mirna and the other arm of the hairpin, as well as between the mirna* sequence and the other arm, should be less than five; meanwhile, no asymmetric bulges larger than two nucleotides and no more than two asymmetric bulges should be present within the mirna/mirna* duplex  <cit>  . of these three rules,  is a fundamental feature of plant mirnas, guaranteeing the precise excision of an approximately  <dig> nt mirna/mirna* duplex from the precursor. although the mirna* structure is also an important feature of plant mirnas, because the abundance of many candidate novel mirnas was low, rule  can be replaced by rule . in total,  <dig> novel mirnas from  <dig> mirna gene loci were identified based on these three rules ;  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas were associated more than one mirna gene locus, and the other  <dig> were associated with a single unique locus . moreover,  <dig> of the  <dig> novel mirnas had the mirna* sequence . the  <dig> nt mirnas were the dominant species  among the  <dig> novel mirnas, followed by  <dig> nt species , and other species were much less frequent . mirnas are typically  <dig> nt in plants; however,  <dig> nt mirnas  were recently identified and shown to be loaded in ago <dig>  <cit> . notably, ago <dig> displayed a preference for srnas with 5’ terminal adenine. as expected, the more novel  <dig> nt mirnas  had 5’ terminal adenine nucleotides   <cit> . furthermore, a majority of the novel  <dig> nt mirnas  had 5’ terminal uridine nucleotides, consistent with the observation that ago <dig> usually harbored mirnas with a 5’ terminal uridine   <cit> . seven of the  <dig> novel mirnas, including novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig>  novel_mir_ <dig> and novel_mir_ <dig>  might be specifically expressed in the cotton fiber . although the abundances of these novel mirnas were lower than those of the conserved mirnas, these mirnas were detected in all four fiber srna libraries but not in young seeds . specifically, novel_mir_ <dig> possessed a mirna* sequence and is predicted to target glucosyltransferase, which is important for generating the cell wall. the  <dig> known and  <dig> novel mirna gene loci were dispersed throughout all thirteen g. raimondii chromosomes . to date, a total of  <dig> mirna precursors have been found in gossypium, including  <dig> precursors in g. hirsutum, four precursors in g. raimondii, one precursor in g. arboretum, and one precursor in g. herbaceum . in this study,  <dig> novel mirna families, including  <dig> mirna loci, were identified, significantly increasing the number of known cotton mirna families.

cotton fiber elongation-related mirnas
to elucidate the potential regulatory roles of mirnas in cotton fiber elongation, we analyzed the differential expression profiles of mirnas. to minimize noise and improve accuracy, only mirnas expressed at greater than  <dig> rptm in at least one library were used for comparison. after fisher’s test  and cluster analyses, as shown in figure 2a, the remaining  <dig> known and nine novel mirnas exhibited differential expression during cotton fiber elongation and clustered into three groups with similar profiles. the known ghmir159/ <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  393-3p, 3711-3p,  <dig>  156/ <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and novel ghmirnas k and d, belonging to type a, showed a gradual increase in read number during cotton fiber elongation, particularly at  <dig> dpa, the point at which fiber elongation is terminated  <cit> . thus, type a mirnas might serve as negative regulators of fiber elongation. the accumulation of mirnas in the known ghmir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  396-5p,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  162-3p,  <dig>  396-3p,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  2948-5p,  <dig> and 165/ <dig> and the novel ghmirnas a, h, f, e, b and c, belonging to type b, peaked at  <dig> or  <dig> dpa, during the rapid fiber elongation period  <cit> , indicating that these mirnas could promote rapid fiber elongation. the accumulation of ghmir <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  7504b,  <dig> and the novel ghmirna j, belonging to type c, were gradually reduced during cotton fiber elongation, implying that these mirnas might play important negative regulatory roles in fiber elongation after  <dig> dpa . we selected ghmir <dig>  ghmir <dig> and ghmir <dig> for qrt-pcr analysis to test the reliability of the deep sequencing analyses. the qrt-pcr results of these three mirnas showed trends similar to those observed in the deep sequencing data . hence, the mirna analysis from our deep sequencing library should be considered highly reliable and appropriate for cluster analysis. meanwhile, the small rna libraries generated at the four time points formed two clusters, the fiber elongation cluster  and the termination of fiber elongation cluster . the  <dig> and  <dig> dpa profiles were most similar to one another, likely because cotton fibers at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa were undergoing rapid elongation. hence, the results of cluster analysis were consistent with the characteristics of fiber development.

a newly identified tasirna in cotton
tasirna is an important clade of regulatory srnas in plants, although they have not been previously identified in cotton. in arabidopsis, four canonical tas gene families produce transcripts that are cleaved by mir <dig>  mir <dig>  or mir <dig>  <cit> . because mir <dig> was not detected in any deep sequencing libraries, and the abundance of mir <dig> was very low , the predicted targets of mir <dig> were analyzed through blast analysis to search for small rna sequences in the sequencing library and identify conserved tas <dig> genes in cotton. phased small rna clusters from one gene, dw <dig>  were identified . this gene sequence showed high homology to the arabidopsis tas <dig> gene ; thus, dw <dig> was considered to represent the cotton tas <dig> gene.

similar to the gene structure in arabidopsis, the tasirna-generating locus in g. hirsutum is flanked by two mir <dig> binding sites , and most of the tasirnas were  <dig> nt long . the most abundant sense strand-produced srnas were produced at the 5’d <dig>  position , similar to the pattern observed in arabidopsis, suggesting that the tasirna biogenesis pathway is highly conserved between plant species.

we analyzed the expression patterns of dw <dig> 5’d <dig> , considered a homolog of functional tasirnas in arabidopsis, during fiber development based on the sequence number. the accumulation of tasirna increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa . target prediction revealed that genes of the auxin response factor  family, such as arf <dig> , arf <dig> , and arf <dig> , were putative targets of tasirnas. the in vivo cleavage of arf <dig>  transcripts was detected using rna ligase-mediated  5’ race   . furthermore, the expression of arf <dig>  as determined using quantitative rt-pcr , was negatively correlated with tasirna accumulation , suggesting that its expression was strongly regulated by tasirna during fiber development.

tasir-arf, a conserved tasirna that targets arfs in plant species, was required for proper leaf polarity development  <cit>  and the suppression of the juvenile-to-adult phase transition in arabidopsis  <cit> . in developing cotton fibers, tasirna repressed arf <dig> during the rapid elongation phase . it remains unclear whether this regulatory pathway contributes to fiber elongation, although arf genes are crucial components of the auxin-signaling pathway and have been suggested to play an important role in fiber development  <cit> . nevertheless, this represents the first identification of a tasirna in g. hirsutum, which expands the plant tasirna family and demonstrates its conservation among different species.

target prediction, validation, and expression correlated with mirnas
to characterize the functions of mirnas with differential rptm in cotton fiber elongation, we first predicted and experimentally validated their targets. using the psrnatarget web server , the targets of the mirnas shown in figure 2a were determined . subsequently, 5’-rlm-race was performed to obtain the target cleavage transcripts. to maximize the detection efficiency of mirna-triggered target cleavage, rnas extracted from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa fibers were separately ligated to a 5’ race adaptor and used to construct race libraries. the race library with the greatest abundance of a particular mirna  was used to validate the corresponding target.

using this strategy, mirna-guided target cleavage was examined for targets of the mirnas listed in figure  <dig> . in total, six target genes of mirna were identified for the first time . calmodulin-binding protein  and the beta subunit of acetyl-coa carboxylase  were identified as targets of the novel mirnas ghmirnc and ghmirne, respectively. similarly, arf <dig> and lrr receptor-like protein kinase  were also newly identified as targets of the known mirnas ghmir <dig> and ghmir <dig>  respectively. additionally, calcium ion binding protein  and the myb transcription factor  were identified as targets of ghmir <dig> and ghmir <dig>  respectively; in contrast, the corresponding mirnas in arabidopsis target growth-regulating factor  and the putative ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme . consistent with previous research, the cleavages of ghspl <dig> and class iii hd-zip protein  <dig> , the targets of ghmir156/ <dig> and ghmir165/ <dig>  respectively, were also detected   <cit> .

as shown in figure 4a, the cleavage products of tc <dig>  and tc <dig>  were precisely terminated at the tenth position from the 5’ end of the complementary region of each associated mirna. however, the tc <dig>  sequences were cleaved three nucleotides downstream of the predicted site , which could reflect further nuclease-mediated degradation of the targets after mirna-mediated cleavage  <cit> . two cleavage sites were found for tc <dig> , tc <dig> , and tc <dig> . one cleavage site was located downstream of the predicted site. as described for the cleavage product of lrr-rlk, these cleavage products may be further degraded after silencing by the corresponding mirnas  <cit> . the other cleavage site was located upstream of the predicted site. this type of cleavage was also found in many other 5’-rlm-race experiments  <cit> , indicating that the potential function of the cleavage by these mirnas warrants further investigation.

the expression of validated mirna target genes was examined using qrt–pcr to determine whether there was a negative correlation between the accumulation of mirnas and their targets at various periods during development. as shown in figure 4b, for the target of type a ghmirnas, tc <dig>  transcript levels were negatively correlated with the accumulation of ghmir156/ <dig>  in contrast to ghmir156/ <dig> expression, which increased from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, tc <dig>  expression was reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa. for the targets of type b ghmirnas, which increased from  <dig> dpa and reached peak levels at  <dig> or  <dig> dpa, the expression level was reduced from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> or  <dig> dpa and subsequently upregulated at  <dig> dpa. these data suggested that the accumulation of these ghmirnas was negatively correlated with the expression of their targets in elongating fibers and showed that the target genes were strictly controlled through these ghmirnas. additionally, myb, which is a target of mir <dig>  was expressed at low levels and did not meet miqe guidelines  <cit> ; thus, no qrt-pcr analysis was performed for this gene.

a potential functional network of fiber elongation-related tasirna and mirnas
the unique biological process of cotton fiber elongation relies on the complex regulation of gene expression. mirnas, which are small but crucial molecules in the regulation of gene expression, play an important role in the process of fiber elongation  <cit> . however, no systemic investigation has been conducted to determine how cotton fiber elongation via mirna-mediated regulation occurs. in this study, a comparative mirnaome analysis combined with 5’-rlm-race revealed eight fiber elongation-related mirnas expressed in cotton fibers and a negative correlation between mirna and target expression in elongating cotton fibers . therefore, these results have fully demonstrated that mirna-mediated regulation occurs in response to fiber elongation. a regulatory network connecting fiber elongation-related mirnas to their targets plays a crucial role in fiber elongation .

for a cotton fiber cell, the precise control of the elongation period is critical. it is not known how the fiber cell knows when to start or end the rapid elongation stage. however, an h2o <dig> burst at  <dig> dpa may serve as a termination signal for rapid fiber elongation  <cit> . anthocyanins are widely identified in plant species to provide flowers and fruits with color  <cit>  and protect the plants from damage by active oxygen species  <cit> . previous studies reported that the spl <dig>  targeted by mir <dig>  negatively regulates anthocyanin accumulation by directly preventing the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes dfr, f3h, and ans <cit> . in this study, the reads of ghmir156/ <dig> increased gradually from  <dig> dpa to  <dig> dpa and were negatively correlated with the level of ghspl <dig> expression . however, the expression levels of the anthocyanin biosynthetic homologous genes in cotton, ghdfr, ghans, ghf3h, and the levels of anthocyanin in developing fibers were reduced from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, similar to the expression pattern of ghspl <dig>  suggesting that ghspl <dig> might play a positive role in regulating the expression of these genes through an unknown mechanism that might be distinct from that in arabidopsis . hence, ghmir156/ <dig>  via its mediation of the cleavage of ghspl <dig> mrna, might negatively regulate the expression of the anthocyanin biosynthetic genes ghdfr, ghf3h, and ghans. this in turn may lead to a strong decline in anthocyanin synthesis at  <dig> dpa, which may be crucial for the h2o <dig> signaling in fiber elongation termination.

calcium-mediated signal transduction plays crucial roles in a wide array of growth and developmental processes. in plants, changes in cellular ca2+ concentration are transmitted through several calcium sensors or calmodulin   <cit> . the obvious inhibition of fiber growth was observed when ovules were cultured in the presence of the cam antagonist tfp  <cit> . here, we identified the calcium sensor cibp as a target of ghmir396-5p. therefore, we speculated that ghmir396-5p, via its mediation of the cleavage of cibp mrna, might promote fiber rapid elongation from  <dig> dpa. furthermore, we also identified the calmodulin -binding protein cambp as a target of ghmirnc. cam isoforms, which might bind cambp, show high affinity to the kinesin-like cam-binding motor protein , which regulates cotton fiber elongation  <cit> . therefore, we speculated that the regulation of cambp through mirnas could play important roles in cotton fiber elongation through ca2+ signal transduction.

various studies on cotton fiber cell development have identified plant hormones as critical regulators of fiber development. auxin promotes the fiber cell development of in vitro cultured ovules, and a positive correlation between final fiber length and in vivo-quantified iaa levels has also been observed  <cit> . arf <dig>  a target of ghmir <dig>  was involved in iaa signal transduction  <cit> . previous evidence showed that an exogenous auxin signal was transduced sequentially through mir <dig> and arf <dig>  <cit> . the reduced expression of gharf <dig>  which is regulated by ghmir <dig> during rapid fiber elongation , was consistent with the negative roles of atarf <dig> in cell expansion during hypocotyl and lateral root elongation  <cit> . hence, ghmir <dig>  via its mediation of the cleavage of arf <dig> mrna, might be critical for rapid fiber elongation. the accumulation of tasir-arf exhibited dynamics similar to those of ghmir <dig>  and its target, arf <dig>  also showed an expression pattern similar to that of arf <dig>  which is targeted by ghmir <dig> . this observation suggests that tasir-arf might be involved in fiber elongation, similar to ghmir <dig>  in addition to auxin, br has been suggested to promote cotton fiber elongation. cotton fiber responses to br are mediated through a plasma membrane-bound leucine-rich  receptor-like protein kinase known as bri, which has an expression pattern and domain structure similar to that of lrr-rlk, which is targeted by ghmir <dig>   <cit> . moreover, we detected significantly higher lrr-rlk expression in g. hirsutum compared with g. arboreum, which has shorter fibers than does g. hirsutum, throughout the elongation phase . the expression of lrr-rlk was high in  <dig> to  <dig> dpa and sharply declined at  <dig> dpa , suggesting that ghmir7505-regulated lrr-rlk might play a positive role in initiating rapid fiber elongation.

the rapid elongation of cotton fiber cells requires substantial lipid synthesis to support the developing organelles and membranes. accd, the target of ghmirne, encodes the β-carboxyl transferase subunit of acetyl-coa carboxylase , which is a regulatory enzyme in fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . however, fatty acid synthesis should be regulated in the rapid elongation stage of the cotton fiber. a recent report showed that the down-regulation of wri <dig>  a positive regulator of lipid biosynthesis, reduced carbon flow into fatty acid biosynthesis, including the expression of accase; meanwhile, the fixed carbon was channeled into fiber growth, resulting in longer fibers  <cit> . hence, the ghmirnd promoted cotton fiber elongation by mediating the decrease in accd expression and diverting more carbon into fiber growth. unlike many other plant cells, cotton fibers contain little to no lignin in their secondary cell walls  <cit> . lignin is primarily deposited into the cell walls of xylem vessel elements, and irregular xylem <dig>  mutant plants have 50% less lignin than wild-type plants  <cit> . the ectopic expression of athb- <dig> in arabidopsis could promote vascular cell differentiation, specifically the differentiation of xylem tissue  <cit> . mir <dig> exhibited strong downregulation in high-lignin tissues  in acacia mangium, and the expression of the mir <dig> target hd-zip  <dig> is much higher in high-lignin tissue   <cit> . the number of reads of ghmir165/ <dig> in rapid elongation fibers  was much higher than that in  <dig> dpa seeds , and the expression of ghhb <dig> at this stage was clearly repressed . we speculated that the lower ghhb <dig> expression mediated by ghmir165/ <dig> might contribute to fiber elongation by inhibiting the differentiation of high-lignin tissues, such as xylem, because a number of lignification mutants revealed the link bewteen cell expansion and xylem tissue differentiation  <cit> .

in this study,  <dig> ghmirnas were differentially expressed during the cotton fiber elongation progress,  <dig>  of which were dramatically upregulated during rapid fiber cell elongation . in arabidopsis, mirnas are loaded into ago <dig>  which acts an rna slicer and is the target of mir <dig>  <cit> . although no ago <dig>  cleavage site was detected in the complementary region of ghmir <dig> , we speculated that ghmir <dig> might cleave ago <dig> mrna. according to the tendency of ghmir <dig> to decrease from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, the expression of ago <dig> mrna should be upregulated. the increased expression of ago <dig>  mediated through ghmir <dig>  might facilitate the gene silencing of the type a and b ghmirna targets discussed above.

furthermore, the abundance of ghmirnas in this network accounted for approximately 80% of the total mirna reads. as shown in additional file 14: table s <dig>  the read numbers of type a and b mirnas were increased at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa  compared with  <dig> dpa, and the reads of type a and b  were higher in  <dig> dpa fibers than in  <dig> dpa seeds. similarly, the type c read numbers were decreased at  <dig> and  <dig> dpa compared with  <dig> dpa, and the type c reads numbers were lower in  <dig> dpa fibers than in  <dig> dpa seeds. these trends indicated that the mirnas in this regulatory network played special roles in cotton fiber cell elongation to some extent. taken together, the data provided in this study showed that mirnas are precisely regulated during fiber elongation and play important roles in various biochemical processes that promote fiber elongation. hence, we propose the mirna-mediated response plays an important role in fiber elongation, opening new avenues for the functional study of mirnas in fibers and even plant cell elongation.

CONCLUSIONS
a total of  <dig> known mirna families and  <dig> novel mirnas from cotton fibers were identified through the high-throughput sequencing of srnas isolated from  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa cotton fibers. this expands the population of known g. hirsutum mirnas and confirmed the existence of ta-sirnas in g. hirsutum. comparisons of the mirnaomes of each stage revealed that  <dig> mirnas were differentially expressed during the cotton fiber elongation; further, the target genes of eight mirnas and one ta-sirna were validated through 5’-rlm-race. the detailed analysis of the expression of their targets at different developmental time points hinted at their varied roles in the regulation of fiber elongation in g. hirsutum.
