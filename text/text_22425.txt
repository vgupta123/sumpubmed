BACKGROUND
meiotic maps are a critical component of the process of unraveling the complexities of the genomics of duplicated taxa 
 <cit> . whole genome duplication with concomitant re-diploidization is broadly acknowledged as the major driving force in adaptation and speciation 
 <cit> . positive selection is enriched in duplicated genes 
 <cit> . sorting the relationships among orthologs, homologs, and homeologs in duplicated genomes can be both daunting 
 <cit>  and rewarding 
 <cit> . meiotic maps have been used to unravel the interactions among linkage, pseudolinkage, homeologous pairing, and interference in duplicated teleosts for more than three decades 
 <cit> . more recently, meiotic maps have become important for comparative genomics 
 <cit>  and association mapping studies 
 <cit> .

techniques that associate genotypes with phenotypes, whether disease, physiological, or ecological traits, can improve our understanding of local adaptation 
 <cit> . understanding how organisms interact with their local environments is increasingly important for conservation and management of natural populations. in order to understand these relationships, studies are turning to association-mapping techniques where thousands of ordered markers across a genome are scanned for association with a trait. the most powerful analyses require thousands of markers in a known order, as found in a genome sequence or high-density linkage map. such tools are currently unavailable for most non-model organisms, though the rapid advance of high throughput sequencing techniques is facilitating their creation 
 <cit> .

the emergence of genotyping by sequencing , 
 <cit>  provides exciting opportunities to rapidly establish meiotic maps for non-model species. previously, marker discovery posed a major hurdle to the development of high density linkage maps. early studies generally included the mapping of only a few hundred markers 
 <cit> . gbs now enables thousands of snps to be genotyped rapidly at relatively low cost 
 <cit> . as a result, dense mapping studies are set to become common in wild populations 
 <cit> , providing opportunities for association mapping, genome scans, and comparative mapping 
 <cit> .

salmonids with their residual polyploidy provide an excellent opportunity for study. salmonids are an iconic family of fish, with both cultural and economic value, that naturally inhabit the north pacific and north atlantic oceans. to date no published genome sequence for salmonids exists, though there are extensive snp and est resources for a few species e.g., 
 <cit> . dense linkage maps, containing thousands of markers, currently only exist for rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss <cit>  and atlantic salmon salmo salar reviewed in 
 <cit> ; these species are intensively cultured for both food and sport fishing on several continents. the ongoing development of linkage maps in additional salmonid species has provided key insights into adaptation, sex determination, disease resistance, and other factors important to both conservation of wild populations and aquaculture. these maps also offer opportunities for comparative genomics 
 <cit> . a collateral benefit is that converting batteries of mapped snps to high-throughput genotyping assays will greatly enhance population genetic studies and genome scans that are becoming a backbone of conservation genomics 
 <cit> .

a salmonid of special interest is the sockeye salmon o. nerka which is culturally important and supports some of the most valuable commercial fisheries by coastal nations throughout the subarctic north pacific ocean 
 <cit> . genomic resources are scant; no genetic maps exist for sockeye salmon. although populations are robust in the northern climes, some cornerstone populations in canada and the usa are threatened or endangered 
 <cit> . as climate change intensifies, concerns intensify that thermal 
 <cit>  or disease 
 <cit>  challenges or both 
 <cit>  will further threaten commercial and subsistence economies 
 <cit> . this threat, occurring during an era empowered by the advent of conservation genomics 
 <cit> , precipitates a need for genomic resources to enable studies of genetic diversity, adaptive variation, and genotype-by-environmental interactions in sockeye salmon. additionally, sockeye salmon exhibit a variety of unique life histories 
 <cit> , and additional genomic resources are necessary for determining the genetic basis for these diverse life history traits.

our study had two goals. first was to discover thousands of novel snps in sockeye salmon using restriction site associated dna sequencing  tags, 
 <cit> . our second goal was to use these markers to generate a high density linkage map, with paired-end sequences 
 <cit>  used to expand template length to annotate as many snps as possible. we also incorporated est-based snps, available through existing 5’-nuclease assays, into our genetic map because the substantial majority of rad tags reside in non-coding sequences. we successfully discovered putative snp-containing loci using rad tag sequencing in a single family and used these to construct male and female consensus maps. the female map contains  <dig>  markers and the male map contains  <dig>  markers.

RESULTS
snp discovery in parents
we had  <dig> single-pair matings available for this study .

number of progeny included from each family, the genotyping method used on each, and the number of segregating est loci.

* hx <dig> and hx13-wl were two different sets of offspring from the same parents. †parents were the male and female from families hx <dig>  hx <dig>  and hx <dig>  the additional parents were used for the assembly of paired end contigs.

the parents from a single family, hx13-wl, were selected for snp discovery. over  <dig>  million rad tag sequences were generated in both the male and female parents . these rad tag sequences as well as the rad tag sequences from the offspring  were deposited in the ncbi short read archive . these sequences were grouped and counted resulting in more than  <dig>  unique sequences in each parent . a frequency histogram of the number of occurrences per unique sequence  shows a sharp peak of sequences that only occur between one and five times in either parent. we filtered these low count sequences and grouped those remaining into loci shared between the two parents . this resulted in a set of  <dig>  shared loci  that contain both monomorphic and polymorphic rad tags. of these,  <dig>  loci were monomorphic,  <dig> loci were homozygous in each parent but polymorphic between the parents,  <dig>  loci were polymorphic in one parent and homozygous in the other and  <dig>  were polymorphic in both parents. only loci that were polymorphic within one or both parents could be mapped, resulting in  <dig>  putative snps to be analyzed further . the location of each snp in the rad tag was relatively evenly distributed , indicating that the snps were unlikely to represent sequencing errors due to drop off of base quality near the end of sequence reads 
 <cit> .

filtered reads is the number of sequence reads after each sequence was trimmed to  <dig> bp; sequences with less than 80% chance of being error free were discarded from further analysis. unique sequences is the number of unique rad tag sequences found in the data from each parent using perl scripts. shared loci is the number of unique loci, shared between the two parents; this includes both polymorphic and monomorphic loci. putative snps is the snp containing loci from the shared loci.

genotyping of offspring
sequencing of rad tags was carried out on  <dig> offspring from family hx13-wl . two rounds of sequencing were necessary to achieve sufficient depth of coverage to accurately call genotypes in the offspring. the first round was carried out on the illumina gaii, and the second round on the illumina hiseq  <dig> . the combined sequencing efforts resulted in between  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> filtered reads per individual with a mean value of  <dig> ,867 ±  <dig> , <dig>  rad tags from each offspring were aligned to the  <dig>  putative snps scored in the parents, and coverage counts for each allele were calculated. coverage values ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  reads with an average of  <dig>  aligned reads. after converting aligned read counts to genotype calls, the majority of offspring  were successfully genotyped at over 90% of the putative snps discovered in the parents .

parents were sequenced with the gaii . offspring were first sequenced with the gaii ; the depth of coverage was insufficient for genotyping and a second round of sequencing was done using the hiseq  <dig> . the results of the gaii single end and hiseq  <dig> single end runs were filtered and trimmed to the same lengths and combined for analysis.

in addition to rad-based snps, we genotyped est-based snps using  <dig> existing 5’-nuclease assays on parents and 45– <dig> offspring from each of the thirteen families . after filtering, each family contained between  <dig> and  <dig> segregating loci, with a total of  <dig> loci segregating across all families . linkage relationships in these families were merged into the final map.

both rad and est genotypes between parents and offspring were compared for inheritance error , and erroneous genotypes were converted to missing data. next the genotypes were screened for segregation distortion. the salmonid genome contains an ancient whole genome duplication and consequently contains many duplicate regions 
 <cit> . the presence of these duplications has resulted in high false positive rates in previous snp discovery efforts. in our data set, markers with significant segregation distortion  may represent these paralogous sequence variants , true distortion due to other genomic factors, or genotyping errors. our genotyping method currently does not allow identification of genotyping error versus true distortion, thus we exclude all markers with significant distortion. out of  <dig>  putative snps,  <dig>   showed significant segregation distortion and were removed from further analysis. the majority of these loci showed allelic distributions that indicated that they were likely psvs . all of the loci removed for segregation distortion were from the rad tag sequences. finally, after removing markers with greater than 25% missing data,  <dig>  rad and 5’-nuclease based snps were used in linkage analyses.

meiotic map construction
linkage mapping was carried out in two steps. first, the genotypes from the  <dig> est loci segregating in family hx13-wl were combined with the rad tag genotypes, and mapping was carried out on the combined rad-est dataset from family hx13-wl. second, mapping was done on the est loci that were segregating in the remaining families to maximize the number of ests that could be included in the final map . linkage groups identified among these est loci were merged with the hx13-wl linkage maps to create male and female consensus maps.

the female rad-est map from family hx13-wl contained  <dig>  markers distributed among  <dig> linkage groups, consistent with the expected number of haploid chromosomes for sockeye salmon 
 <cit> . the total map length was  <dig> . <dig> cm. twenty three markers failed to map and were excluded from further analysis. additionally, this map contained two small fragments, each containing only two markers, which were discarded from further analysis.

the male rad-est map initially contained  <dig> linkage groups and a total length of  <dig> . <dig> cm. visual inspection of individual linkage groups and comparison to the female map revealed that one male linkage group corresponded to three female linkage groups . inspection of the recombination frequency matrix for the corresponding male and female linkage groups revealed that the male linkage group contained two linkage groups joined through an apparently spurious linkage relationship due to a single marker. no corresponding relationship could be observed in the female. this marker was removed, and the two linkage groups were separated. one of the divided male linkage groups matched to female lg <dig> and the other matched to the remaining two female groups . additionally, one female linkage group corresponded to two male linkage groups, lg7a and lg7b. lg7a contained only five markers and may represent a fragment of the larger lg7b. a number of markers within lg7a had lod > <dig> with markers in 7b, suggesting that these are part of a single group. after corrections, the male rad-est linkage map contained  <dig>  markers distributed among  <dig> linkage groups and eight small fragments containing only two or three markers. these fragments were discarded from further analysis. sixteen markers failed to map. the male map length was  <dig> . <dig> cm.

there were 29– <dig> segregating loci per parent in the est data set from the additional families . as a result, only small linkage groups were established, consisting of between two and four markers per group with up to nine groups per family. overlaps of two or more markers between groups among the families allowed some groups to be merged. after merging,  <dig> linkage relationships in the males and  <dig> in the females, consisting of between two and five markers each, were established. these fragments were compared to the rad-based map from family hx13-wl and merged where two or more markers overlapped. in this fashion, thirteen additional est loci were added to the consensus map, seven additional markers in the female map and six additional markers in the male. the remaining est groups were excluded from further analysis.

merging the est markers did not alter the number of linkage groups. the consensus female map contained  <dig>  markers in  <dig> linkage groups and a total length of  <dig> . <dig> cm and the consensus male map contained  <dig>  markers with a total length of  <dig> . <dig> cm across  <dig> linkage groups .

there were  <dig> overlapping loci between the male and the female maps  . in all cases the overlapping loci were assigned to the same linkage groups. the male map had two linkage groups  that corresponded to a single linkage group  in the female map, resulting in  <dig> unique male groups when compared to the female map. examination of the recombination matrix for the corresponding female linkage group did not support splitting this group. additionally, as noted above, male lg <dig> corresponds to female lg <dig> and lg <dig> 

a number of linkage groups contain minor order discrepancies between the male and the female maps . the markers contained these groups consistently in even when the lod score is varied. removal of each marker and repositioning using try.seq in both the male and the female was unable to resolve the order variation in these groups. in no cases did shared markers map to different linkage groups between the male and the female. linkage groups containing marker order discrepancies include lg <dig>  lg <dig>  lg <dig>  and lg <dig> 

recombination in the male was reduced over what was observed in the female. the male map contained  <dig> more markers than the female but was  <dig>  cm shorter overall. as not all markers are shared between the male and female, it is inappropriate to make a direct comparison between corresponding linkage groups. rather, we compared the distance between the most proximal and distal shared pair within each group. the ratio for individual linkage groups ranged from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig>  additionally, the male had more extensive clusters of non-recombinant markers across linkage groups .

the distance between the most proximal and distal of the shared markers was calculated for the male and female on each linkage group and a ratio was compared from these distances. male lg <dig> corresponds to female lg <dig> and lg29; the distances between the shared markers from lg27-f and lg29-f are both included. lg <dig> is split in the male and 7a and 7b are the shared markers from each of the male linkage groups.

comparison to rainbow trout
the complete set of  <dig>  putative rad tag loci from sockeye salmon  was compared to  <dig>  rad tag loci from rainbow trout 
 <cit> . a blastn comparison revealed  <dig>  pairwise blast hits between the two species with an e-value of less than 10- <dig>  many of these hits, however, were matches for only a portion of a tag or contained gaps . after filtering ,  <dig>  full length matches between the species were discovered. these  <dig>  matches contain monomorphic rad tag sequences and both mapped and unmapped snps from both species. we filtered the  <dig>  matches for those contained in each linkage map to examine synteny between the two species. fifty-five markers were shared between the  <dig>  snps included in the sockeye salmon linkage maps and the  <dig>  snps in the rainbow trout linkage map 
 <cit> . the  <dig> markers were not evenly distributed across the sockeye linkage map . seven sockeye salmon linkage groups contained no hits to the mapped rainbow trout rad tags. among the remaining  <dig> linkage groups, the number of shared tags between groups ranged from a single tag to four. five sockeye linkage groups contained matches to two separate rainbow trout linkage groups. two rainbow trout linkage groups matched to two sockeye linkage groups, with all remaining matches between single linkage groups.
 <cit> ]

in cases where there are hits to more than one linkage group, the number of hits for each is listed in the same order as the linkage groups. two rainbow trout linkage groups, ws <dig> and ws <dig>  match to two separate sockeye salmon linkage groups. the ws designations are the names from miller et al. 
 <cit> , 
 <dig> and 
 <dig> references the specific o. mykiss chromosomes.

paired-end sequencing
paired-end sequencing of genomic dna from six parents, to provide longer contigs for annotation, produced between  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> filtered reads per individual for assembly. out of  <dig>  potential contigs,  <dig>  were successfully assembled with a minimum length of  <dig> bp. average contig length was 211 ±  <dig> bp, with an average coverage value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  reads.

after removing duplicate sequences, including the second allele in heterozygous loci,  <dig>  contigs remained. a blastx search of these contigs against the swiss-prot database identified  <dig> sequences that match a database sequence with an e-value of 10- <dig> or less. after assigning goslim terms, the sequences span a range of biological processes and cellular functions . of the  <dig> annotations,  <dig> could not be assigned goslim terms. while there were no specific patterns in the distribution of goslim terms, the two most common processes are transport and transcription. among the sequences with assigned goslim terms the most common biological processes are cellular transcription and transport, followed by multicellular organismal development. in cellular function, dna binding and protein binding were the most common terms with 18%, and 17% respectively . close inspection of the dna binding category revealed numerous transposable elements. additional transposable elements were found in the annotated sequences lacking goslim terms. in total, out of  <dig> annotated sequences,  <dig> were transposable elements or related to transposition . these were the most common annotations found in our data .

discussion
here we present a first-pass meiotic map for sockeye salmon that contains  <dig> linkage groups, the number expected based upon the sockeye salmon karyotype  
 <cit> . the final map contains  <dig>  snp and est loci distributed over more than  <dig>  cm.

linkage maps have been created for a number of salmonids using a variety of genotyping strategies. until now, these maps generally required iterative attempts, through time, where markers were added and linkage groups converged as new genotyping techniques materialized. in many cases these early efforts were based on microsatellite and amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and had modest initial map sizes. currently the most complete linkage maps are available for atlantic salmon  
 <cit>  and rainbow trout  
 <cit> . the initial map in coho salmon o. kisutch contained  <dig> microsatellite and aflp markers 
 <cit> . mapping in brown trout salmo trutta used  <dig> microsatellite and aflp markers 
 <cit> , and a map in arctic char salvelinus alpinus contained  <dig> aflp, microsatellite, and snp markers 
 <cit> . the pink salmon o. gorbuscha map of  <dig> loci emerged from iterations that also included fragments originating from pcr priming on short interspersed repeats sines, 
 <cit>  and randomly amplified polymorphic dna rapds, 
 <cit> . microsatellites have advantages over the other marker types due to their high rates of heterozygosity and large number of alleles which facilitate mapping. however all of these strategies are based on the accurate sizing of specific fragments and yield genotypes that are extremely difficult to compare among laboratories and through time.

recently, massively parallel sequencing has allowed the rapid development of hundreds to thousands of novel snps in many species. as in our study, these studies map hundreds to thousands of novel markers. the rapid advance of high throughput sequencing promises to greatly speed the generation of novel genetic maps for previously unmapped or minimally mapped species 
 <cit> . the sequences from gbs are also easily converted to other methods of snp genotyping, and genotypes obtained from snps from any method are generally comparable among laboratories and through time because they are based upon specific nucleotide differences rather than allele sizes.

our map approaches the size of certain recent atlantic salmon and rainbow trout genetic maps. the most recent atlantic salmon map contains more than  <dig>  snps 
 <cit> . the previous map for atlantic salmon was also large, containing approximately  <dig>  aflp, microsatellite, and snp markers, similar to our map size 
 <cit> . the most recent rainbow trout maps contain  <dig>  markers based on aflps, microsatellites and snps 
 <cit>  and  <dig>  markers based upon rad tags 
 <cit> . the aflp and microsatellite-based maps represent years of discovery and mapping.

salmonids have different rates of recombination between the sexes 
 <cit> . rexroad et al. 
 <cit>  reported an overall ratio of female to male recombination in rainbow trout of  <dig> : <dig>  with recombination rates on individual chromosomes ranging from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig>  in atlantic salmon the overall recombination ratio was  <dig> : <dig>  and the individual female to male ratios varied from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig> 
 <cit> . direct comparison of our male and female maps is inappropriate because our maps contained both shared markers and markers unique to each gender. given that marker order is generally conserved in the shared markers, we compare the distances between the most proximal and distal of the shared markers between the male and female linkage groups to compare rates of recombination. overall recombination rates in males were lower than in females, which can be observed in figure 
 <dig>  the recombination ratio among shared markers on individual linkage groups ranged from  <dig> : <dig> to  <dig> : <dig> . our findings are consistent with those in both rainbow trout and atlantic salmon where a number of the male linkage groups were larger than the female groups 
 <cit> . current research in salmonids suggests that recombination in males is restricted to the telomeres 
 <cit> , thus our values are likely underestimates of the true recombination differences between males and females .

there are regional differences in recombination between the females and males . in the female, markers recombine along the length of the linkage groups, while there are blocks of markers with little or no recombination in most of the male linkage groups. large regions of non-recombinant markers have been observed in other salmonid species including atlantic salmon and rainbow trout 
 <cit> . two of these studies suggest that these blocks of non-recombinant markers may be located near the centromeres 
 <cit> ; however, additional information is needed to confirm this assertion in sockeye salmon. while blocks of non-recombinant markers were present on most  linkage groups in the male map, the blocks that we observed were smaller than those observed in atlantic salmon or rainbow trout. additionally, while overall recombination is reduced in the male as compared to the female, many of the markers shared between the genders are well spaced in both the male and the female . this may be an artifact of the onemap analysis. onemap uses maximum likelihood to assign phase to markers which are identical heterozygotes in the progeny and parents 
 <cit> . this allows the inclusion of these markers in the linkage map but it is unclear how this analysis may interact with the limited recombination in the male however, despite the spacing of these markers, overall the male map had more limited recombination than the female . inclusion of more families in future efforts would help to resolve marker spacing and order issues.

our total map lengths are larger than previously observed in salmonids. the salmon genome size is estimated to be  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig> bp 
 <cit>  which would correspond to a map length of approximately  <dig>  cm . several linkage groups such as lg6-f  contain large distances between either individual markers or small clusters of markers and the remaining linkage group. these large breaks could be the result of weak linkage relationships. additionally, four linkage groups contained discrepancies in the order determined between male and female . varying the lod score had no effect on the assignment of markers to their specified group. other efforts to resolve the order including dropping and using the try.seq function on each marker to optimize position were unsuccessful. while the order could be manually changed, the size of the linkage group was often greatly increased and large breaks between markers were introduced. increasing the number of individuals mapped may reduce the distance between these and other markers by strengthening linkage relationships and eliminating error, resulting in more consistent measurement of genetic distance, as well as helping to resolve marker order in the four linkage groups. inflated map lengths and marker order problems may also be a result of missing data or genotyping errors 
 <cit> . slate et al. 
 <cit>  demonstrated that, when genotyping error is present, markers tend to be assigned to correct chromosomes but with inflated map distances and order errors. we minimized genotyping error in several ways: our rad data coverage is higher than the recommended coverage values for accurate gbs 
 <cit> , and markers with greater than 25% missing data, inheritance error, and significant segregation distortion were removed. however some errors may still remain. the effect of even a few errors is likely also compounded by our relatively small sample size . increasing sample size to increase the number of recombination events would reduce the effect of genotyping error and give higher confidence in map lengths and order.

our rad tag loci, including both putative snps and monomorphic loci, were compared with those discovered for rainbow trout in miller et al. 
 <cit> . using strict comparison criteria, we discovered more than  <dig>  matches between the two data sets, including  <dig> shared markers between the maps . these matches represent only  <dig> percent of the total number of the rainbow trout rad loci. a previous study reported  <dig>  percent identity between rainbow trout and sockeye salmon; however, this study focused on similarity among coding regions 
 <cit> . we compared anonymous regions of genomic dna where rates of nucleotide divergence may be higher than those in coding regions. due to the short length of the rad tags, strict criteria for matches were imposed . this likely underestimates the number of true hits between the species. salmonid species including rainbow trout, atlantic salmon, arctic char and coho salmon have been shown to have large syntenic blocks among chromosome arms 
 <cit> . our results are consistent with this finding. a recent study by faber-hammond et al. 
 <cit>  demonstrated that the sockeye salmon neo-y chromosome corresponds to two rainbow trout chromosome arms from rainbow trout chromosome  <dig> and chromosome  <dig>  based on our comparison to the rainbow trout rad map, we have corresponding matches on linkage groups lg <dig> and lg <dig> suggesting that one of these may contain the sockeye salmon neo-y chromosome. further testing is needed to confirm this.

longer contigs were assembled for more than  <dig>  rad tag alleles, and from these  <dig>  were annotated using a blastx search. we initially anticipated a much lower rate of annotation consistent with the percentage of protein coding sequence in salmonids . amores et al. 
 <cit>  points out that sbfi, the enzyme used to create our rad libraries, targets gc rich regions and thus cuts frequently in coding regions. out of these  <dig> annotations,  <dig>  were transposable elements or related to transposition. transposable elements are common in large genomes 
 <cit>  and it has been proposed that transposable elements may play a role in the speciation of salmonids 
 <cit> . the remaining annotations span a variety of biological processes and functions .

snps detected in rad tags presented here should convert to high-throughput assays such as 5’-nuclease with high success. high-throughput genotyping of snps has emerged as an important tool for study of early life history, migration, and conservation of non-model organisms including sockeye salmon 
 <cit> . many snps discovered in transcriptome sequence, an approach commonly used in the past, fail to amplify in high-throughput assays because of their proximity to intron boundaries 
 <cit> . we attempted assays for  <dig> of our rad-based snps; nine successfully amplified and performed in three test populations . using snps derived from paired-end sequences enhances the opportunity to develop assays that require priming and probing templates that may approach  <dig> bp.

CONCLUSIONS
currently, genomic resources for sockeye salmon are scant. here we present a first pass meiotic map generated from  <dig>  rad and est-based snps. this map and set of snps will prove to be an enormous resource for both association mapping and landscape and conservation genomics e.g., 
 <cit> . of course, adding rad tags and est-based snps for more individuals and more families will further refine the map and improve its value for comparative mapping.
