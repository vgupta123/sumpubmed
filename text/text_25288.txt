BACKGROUND
class iii histone deacetylases, known as sirtuins, are a large and ancient family of nad+-dependent protein deacetylases that regulate a range of cellular processes. these phylogenetically conserved enzymes deacetylate both histone and non-histone targets. originally based on the founding family member, yeast sir <dig>  molecular phylogenetic analyses have since revealed five sirtuin subclasses i-iv and u  <cit> , which display diversity in subcellular localization and function  <cit> . for example, of the seven human sirtuin homologs, several reside in the nucleus where they have roles in genomic stability and cell proliferation. others act in the cytoplasm on cytoskeletal targets or work in mitochondria to regulate energy metabolism and responses to oxidative stress  <cit> . sirtuins in subclass i, which include human sirt1- <dig> and yeast hst <dig> and sir <dig>  commonly localize to the nucleus  where they have various chromatin-related functions. for example, sir <dig> regulates telomeric, cryptic mating-type, and rdna silencing  <cit> . this diverse set of functions underlies numerous links between development, disease, and sirtuin activity reported in recent years  <cit> .

many sirtuin-linked cell abnormalities may relate to their roles in chromatin dynamics. to further probe these possibilities we turned to the single-celled protozoan tetrahymena thermophila. this ciliate expresses eleven putative sirtuins, most are more closely related to sirtuins in humans than to those in yeasts  <cit> . tetrahymena provides several advantages for chromatin dynamics studies. first, the cells harbor two nuclei with different chromatin characteristics. the "macronucleus" is transcriptionally active and contains primarily euchromatin, but undergoes widespread facultative heterochromatin formation during cell starvation  <cit> . conversely, the "micronucleus" is transcriptionally silent and contains chromatin that is highly condensed into constitutive heterochromatin-like structures throughout vegetative growth  <cit> . this unique nuclear dimorphism facilitates study of factors that contribute to the differentiation and maintenance of euchromatin and heterochromatin states in the respective nuclei.

second, nuclear differentiation into the dimorphic micronucleus and macronucleus during sexual conjugation involves multiple processes including dna replication, dna fragmentation and elimination, chromatin remodeling/differentiation, and nuclear degradation. these events are easily synchronized in a cell population and occur in a strict temporal order in only a subset of the post-zygotic nuclei . half of the highly condensed, transcriptionally inert post-zygotic nuclei differentiate into transcriptionally active, euchromatic nuclei, while the other half remain inert. another notable feature of tetrahymena development is the programmed degradation of select nuclei at distinct points in the development pathway. following meiosis, three of four gametes degrade in the posterior end of the cell. later, the parental macronucleus degrades as newly differentiating macronuclei become transcriptionally active  <cit> . the latter degradation mechanism resembles that of caspase-independent apoptosis in higher organisms in several ways, including occurrence of chromatin condensation and production of oligonucleosome sized dna fragments  <cit> , but lacks other hallmarks such as the phosphorylation of h2a.x  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the contribution of sirtuin deacetylase activity to chromatin differentiation and programmed nuclear degradation. we found that nicotinamide, a physiological sirtuin inhibitor  <cit> , prevented normal progression of both of these processes. furthermore, we identified one sirtuin  that resides in nucleoli, in mitochondria, and in distinct nuclear sub-structures, all in response to different physiological conditions and stages of the life cycle. intriguingly, thd <dig> accumulated in chromatin-rich regions of the degrading macronucleus during the period of chromatin condensation that precedes global degradation.

RESULTS
nicotinamide treatment affects meiotic condensation, nuclear differentiation, and degradation of the macronucleus during development
phylogenetic analyses previously revealed eleven tetrahymena proteins that possess sirtuin-type deacetylase domains  <cit> . this is a larger number than what most other organisms, including mammals, possess. four of the proteins cluster in sirtuin subclass i, most members of which have nuclear functions. the potential contribution of sirtuin deacetylase activity to nuclear differentiation in tetrahymena was examined by assessing nuclear development in conjugating cells treated with nicotinamide , a physiological sirtuin inhibitor  <cit> . major chromatin changes during nuclear differentiation are accompanied by easily-distinguished changes in nuclear morphology. cells of two different mating types were mixed  and immediately treated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> mm nam. these concentrations were chosen based on those typically used for yeast and human cells  and the fact that for tetrahymena, other histone deacetylase inhibitors must be used at 5-10-fold higher concentrations for effects comparable to mammalian cells  <cit> . nuclear morphology in nam-treated conjugating pairs was compared to that of conjugating control cells , by dapi staining and fluorescence microscopy at 2- <dig> hour intervals. cells treated with  <dig> mm nam arrested four hours into conjugation at meiotic prophase i . at this stage micronuclei have drastically elongated and chromosomes have decondensed and assumed a "bouquet-like" arrangement  <cit>  . based on the size and shape of prophase micronuclei in the nam-arrested cells, the majority appeared to be in zygotene  and pachytene   <cit> , even  <dig> hours later . cells treated with  <dig> mm  and  <dig> mm nam were able to progress through meiosis  but displayed other downstream phenotypes described below. these phenotypes were detected in a greater fraction of cells treated with  <dig> mm nam; thus, this concentration was used for further analyses.

normally after fertilization, tetrahymena zygotic nuclei undergo two mitoses. two of the four resulting nuclei remain highly condensed, transcriptionally inert micronuclei, while the other two differentiate into new transcriptionally active macronuclei, called "anlagen" . nam-treated cells that were able to progress past meiosis contained 1- <dig> additional nuclei per conjugating pair after  <dig> hours, compared to untreated cells that had reached "endpoint" nuclear configuration by hour  <dig> . the additional nuclei in nicotinamide-treated cells likely resulted from one of two events: failure of three gamete pronuclei to degrade after meiosis, or additional mitoses of zygotic nuclei after fertilization. the former possibility was supported based on the following: 1) gamete pronuclei were rarely observed at the extreme posterior end of the cells where degradation occurs; 2) never were there fewer than four equally-sized nuclei observed in any cell of a pair during the early conjugation stages .

later in conjugation, the extra nuclei appeared to differentiate judging from nucleus size and intensity of dapi staining . the majority of nuclei in each cell were enlarged with diffuse chromatin, typical of anlagen morphology . to further examine the differentiated status of chromatin, nuclei in nam-treated conjugating cells were probed for the presence of the micronucleus-specific linker histone  by immunofluorescence with Î±-mlh antiserum. mlh, a hallmark of silent micronuclear heterochromatin, is selectively eliminated in nuclei destined to become new macronuclei when euchromatin differentiation and transcriptional activity is initiated  <cit> . like all normal post-zygotic nuclei, nam-treated nuclei contained mlh prior to differentiation . however, by  <dig> hrs after mixing, most cells  contained no mlh-positive nuclei; in approximately 10% of the cells one mlh-positive nucleus was observed . in contrast, untreated cells each contained one clear mlh-positive micronucleus , reflecting normal development at  <dig> hrs after mixing. the loss of mlh in most nuclei of nam-treated cells indicated that the extra nuclei were differentiating primarily into new macronuclei containing euchromatin  at a ratio of 3- <dig> anlagen: <dig> micronucleus/cell . this interpretation was supported by the swollen appearance and weaker dapi staining of these nuclei, two hallmarks of new macronuclei. moreover, immunofluorescence studies showed that during their development, ~90% of the nuclei in nam-treated cells acquired at least two other macronucleus-specific marks that appear in developing anlagen: the nucleolar protein nop <dig> , and acetylated histones . together, these results suggest that sirtuin activity is necessary for the maintenance of mlh and for the development of heterochromatin in half of the post-zygotic nuclei . furthermore, chromatin in additional nuclei  appeared to differentiate toward transcriptional competency.

during the nuclear differentiation process, the old parental macronucleus migrates to the posterior end of the cell  and degrades by a regulated mechanism that is coordinated with other developmental events. the mechanism shares features with apoptosis  and autophagy   <cit> . in our experiments, the old parental macronucleus failed to degrade in the majority of nam-treated pairs. cells retained their parental macronucleus even  <dig> hrs after mixing when new macronuclei had at least partially differentiated , suggesting that sirtuin deacetylase activity was necessary for normal macronuclear degradation, which initiates prior to this stage. in addition, a larger fraction of cells retained their parental macronucleus if treated with nam earlier in conjugation than shortly before its programmed degradation . treatment immediately prior to the start of macronuclear degradation  resulted in only ~33% cells retaining the old macronucleus , compared to ~79% when treated at  <dig> hours post-mixing .

to test whether nam treatment compromised dna degradation, conjugating pairs were subjected to a tunel  assay to detect fragmented dna. as expected, parental macronuclei in untreated conjugating cells were tunel positive  <dig> hrs into conjugation . in contrast, nam-treated cells at the same stage with  contained a tunel-negative parental macronucleus. this result supported the idea that parental macronuclear dna failed to degrade in sirtuin-inhibited cells. occasionally, a single tunel positive micronucleus was observed later in conjugation, likely one that normally degrades at the end of conjugation . here, this served as a positive signal comparison for "tunel-negative" nuclei .

these results, which suggest a role for sirtuins in apoptotic-like nuclear degradation, prompted us to identify specific sirtuins that may contribute to the degradation process. the putative sirtuin named tetrahymena histone deacetylase  <dig>  was identified for further investigation due to its localization to the parental macronucleus in preliminary studies.

thd <dig> resembles a class 1b sirtuin
amino acid sequence comparisons of open reading frames predicted by the tetrahymena genome database  identified gene , hereafter called thd <dig>  as one of eleven putative sirtuins encoded in the genome  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree constructed with all human, yeast, and putative tetrahymena sirtuins showed that thd <dig> has strongest similarity to the class  <dig> sirtuins, along with three other tetrahymena proteins . amino acid alignments between the sirtuin core domain of thd <dig> and those of human class i sirtuins  show strong homology .

multiple expressed sequence tags  spanned the majority of the computationally-predicted coding sequence for thd <dig> . the expected coding sequence was confirmed using reverse transcriptase-pcr to amplify cdna with primers spanning the predicted start and stop codons, followed by cloning and sequencing of the products. resulting thd <dig> cdna sequence was consistent with the computationally predicted coding sequence. the gene contains one intron and encodes a  <dig> amino acid protein with two domains: a sirtuin deacetylase domain and a ubp-like zinc finger domain . the predicted protein molecular mass of  <dig>  kd was experimentally confirmed by immunoblot analysis of lysates from cells expressing  <dig> Ã ha epitope-tagged thd <dig>  anti-ha antiserum detected a protein of ~ <dig> kd  according to its mobility in sds-page .

computational analysis of thd <dig> amino acid sequence revealed a sirtuin "core domain"  with typical sirtuin motifs  and highly conserved  catalytic domain residues  <cit> . importantly, thd <dig> contains the critical catalytic histidine residue in the 'hg' motif that is strictly conserved in all known sirtuins . immunoprecipitated ha-thd <dig> catalyzed the deacetylation of acetylated n-terminal histone peptide substrates, thus confirming it as a functional histone deacetylase . the presence of specific intraclass-conserved residues further supported assignment of thd <dig> as a class i sirtuin. in particular, the pfa sub-motif is specific to class ib enzymes, as is the alanine preceding the hg motif   <cit> .

one unique feature of thd <dig> is an amino terminal zinc-finger domain of the ubiquitin protease -type superfamily, commonly found on ubiquitin hydrolase enzymes . interestingly, the highest domain homology is with a ubp-type domain found on the murine class ii histone deacetylase hdac <dig> . named a polyubiquitin associated zinc finger  domain, it coordinates  <dig> zn2+ ions to bind with high affinity to polyubiquitin protein modifications  <cit> . this domain on thd <dig> contains  <dig> out of the  <dig> highly conserved cysteine and histidine residues used to coordinate the zn2+ ions . of those residues, the domain on thd <dig> contains all that are absolutely required for ubiquitin binding   <cit>  . thd <dig> is the only one of the eleven tetrahymena sirtuins that contains a paz domain.

thd <dig> transcription peaks in early conjugation
thd <dig> expression throughout the tetrahymena life cycle was examined. two different mating types were starved , mixed to initiate conjugation, and allowed to conjugate over a 24-hour period. population synchrony was monitored at regular intervals by determining the fraction of cells in each developmental stage . throughout the entire conjugation time course,  <dig> to 70% of the cells were tightly synchronized and an additional  <dig> to 25% of the culture was within  <dig> minutes of this primary synchronized population. reverse transcriptase-pcr  and qrt-pcr using cdna made from the conjugating cells at 1-hour intervals  was performed. thd <dig> transcription was moderate in growing and 24-hour starved cells and elevated in early  stages of conjugation. then, thd <dig> expression slowly decreased over subsequent intervals, except at  <dig> hrs after mixing , where the highest expression level was observed . these results were consistent with those from microarray experiments, which also show that the  <dig> hour peak initiates at  <dig> hrs http://tged.ihb.ac.cn <cit> . together, these results suggest that thd <dig> transcription is regulated according to physiological state and developmental stage, and raises the possibility of a role for this sirtuin in pre-meiotic events.

in other cell types, select sirtuin activities are induced by starvation. to examine thd <dig> expression during starvation, mrna was quantified by qrt-pcr over a  <dig> hour period following nutrient depletion. relative to vegetatively growing cells, a dramatic increase in expression was observed immediately with starvation initiation, and levels remained high over the interval tested . this result raised the possibility that thd <dig> has a starvation-specific function that is rapidly induced with nutrient depletion.

thd <dig> is in mitochondria and nucleoli during vegetative growth, and aggregates during starvation
to examine localization of thd <dig>  green fluorescent protein  was fused to the amino terminus. the fusion gene, gfp-thd <dig>  was carried on a high-copy tetrahymena rdna vector  <cit>  and expressed from the inducible metallothionein  <dig>  promoter   <cit> . in mid-logarithmic growing cells, gfp-thd <dig> was detected in mitochondria, which were marked with fluorescent mitrotracker dye . gfp-thd <dig> was also detected in the multiple nucleoli positioned around the macronuclear periphery , which were illuminated by differential interference microscopy . food vacuoles in the cytoplasm, a common fluorescent artifact from over-expression of gfp tagged proteins , were ignored in this analysis. consistent with nucleolar localization, immunofluorescence revealed that the nucleolar protein nop <dig>  <cit>  co-localized to regions containing gfp-thd <dig> . furthermore, these regions with gfp-thd <dig> stained only weakly with dapi, a common characteristic of nucleoli.

we next tested whether gfp-thd <dig> remained in nucleoli under conditions that alter rdna metabolism. with prolonged nutrient starvation, tetrahymena nucleoli aggregate to form larger masses around the nuclear periphery  <cit>  coincident with a global decrease in transcription of rdna and many protein-coding genes. after 18- <dig> hours of starvation, gfp-thd <dig> was still present in the nucleoli in the majority of cells. however, the most intense fluorescence concentrated in a single large aggregate within the macronucleus  that was visible by  <dig> minutes after nutrient depletion , and reached maximum size  <dig> hours later. of the cells showing nucleolar fluorescence around the periphery , approximately half  contained the larger aggregate. the aggregate of fluorescence appeared as a clustering of multiple small rings, suggesting sub-structural organization of thd <dig> within the larger aggregate . as well, dapi staining was weaker or absent from the concentration of gfp-thd <dig>  dic imaging mapped thd <dig> aggregates to distinct structures within the nucleus . immunofluorescence with anti-nop <dig> antiserum revealed that nop <dig> ringed the entire thd <dig> aggregate  indicating a relationship to nucleoli.

thd <dig> concentrates inside the macronucleus immediately prior to programmed degradation
to assess thd <dig> distribution during development and nuclear differentiation, cells expressing gfp-thd <dig> were starved and mixed with wild type cells of a different mating type to initiate sexual conjugation. samples of conjugating pairs were examined by fluorescence microscopy at regular intervals throughout the course of conjugation  and  <dig> hours after initiation . in early conjugation  the rings in the gfp-thd <dig> focus became more pronounced, then diffused throughout the macronucleus. by mid-conjugation  at stages immediately preceding old macronucleus pycnosis and degradation, gfp-thd <dig> became increasingly and selectively concentrated within the old macronucleus, but remained absent from the young, developing new macronuclei . within the degrading nucleus, thd <dig> localized to the area occupied by pycnotic heterochromatin within the boundary of the nuclear envelope as revealed by dic microscopy .

discussion
sirtuins are known to influence chromatin dynamics related to gene silencing, dna repair, and maintenance of chromosome structural features such as telomeres. in this study we examined processes involving chromatin dynamics that are easily synchronized and monitored using tetrahymena conjugation. sirtuin inhibition with nicotinamide  affected three events requiring significant changes to global chromatin structure:  meiotic chromosome condensation,  differentiation of transcriptionally inert nuclei, and  programmed nuclear degradation.

during meiotic prophase, the germline micronucleus elongates ~50-fold resulting in a string-like "crescent" nucleus. chromosomes decondense and assume a bouquet-like formation for homologous pairing and recombination, then re-condense prior to metaphase i  <cit> . with  <dig> mm nam treatment, decondensation and elongation was unaffected , but re-condensation appeared incomplete; the majority of cells arrested with partially elongated micronuclei . the class i sirtuin, sirt <dig>  was previously implicated in promoting chromosome condensation during mitosis in human cells by deacetylating histone h <dig>  <cit> . however, evidence for sirtuin roles in meiotic chromatin dynamics was lacking prior to this study.

cells in a lower nam concentration proceeded through meiosis, but displayed other chromatin differentiation defects. first, more than four post-zygotic nuclei were observed in most cells. of these nuclei, all  initiated new macronucleus chromatin development involving loss of micronuclear linker histone  , and gain of both nop <dig>  and histone acetylation . the ratio of differentiating macronuclei to micronuclei was 3-6: <dig> instead of the normal 2: <dig> in most pairs . these data suggest that sirtuins normally promote the retention of mlh and development of heterochromatin in micronucleus-destined nuclei. our observations suggest that the abnormally large number of nuclei in sirtuin-inhibited cells resulted from failure of gamete degradation prior to fertilization , an aberrant event that could be mechanistically related to the failure of parental macronuclear degradation observed later in conjugation. this idea is consistent with a previous observation that halting macronuclear degradation with pi- <dig> kinase inhibitors led to the retention and reprogramming of pronuclei to differentiate into micro- and macronuclei  <cit> . our results indicate that the retained extra nuclei are capable of differentiating from transcriptionally silent to transcriptionally active nuclei, and that this pathway is chosen  in the absence of sirtuin activity.

unlike normal cells that lose their parental macronucleus by  <dig> hours into conjugation, nam-treated cells retained a macronucleus that exhibited little to no dna degradation . programmed macronuclear degradation is thought to proceed through an apoptosis-like, caspase-independent mechanism that is dependent on endonuclease g activity and apoptosis inducing factor  stored in mitochondria  <cit> . there is a well-described relationship in which chromatin condensation precedes dna fragmentation in apoptosis  <cit> ; one that also applies to programmed nuclear death in tetrahymena  <cit> , but the mechanistic details underlying these chromatin changes in any system are poorly understood. in tetrahymena, macronuclear dna first condenses to less than half its original volume by  <dig> hours of conjugation, followed by global degradation of chromatin and resorption by the autophagosome  <cit> . this degree of condensation was inhibited in the majority of nam-treated cells . given that dna degradation also failed in these nuclei , sirtuin activity may be necessary for the chromatin condensation step of nuclear degradation, a prerequisite to global degradation. interestingly, sirtuin inhibition did not affect the global deacetylation of histone h <dig> in parental macronuclear chromatin during pycnosis , but it may be targeting other histones or nonhistone targets to mediate condensation. our nam treatment time course  suggests sirtuin involvement in an earlier degradation step, possibly involving initial signaling. normally, commitment of nuclei to new macronuclear development at 6- <dig> hours into conjugation triggers destruction of the old parental macronucleus, which involves its migration to the posterior region of the cell  <cit> . in our study, although nam-treated nuclei committed to anlagen development, parental macronuclei failed to migrate in ~30% of cells  consistent with possible disruption of the degradation "triggering" event.

sirtuins are involved in signaling pathways preventing apoptosis and cellular senescence in other organisms  <cit> , but no direct action on chromatin destined for degradation has been described. although it is possible that the nam treatment in our study inhibited nuclear degradation through blocking sirtuin-mediated signaling pathways, we present evidence that at least one tetrahymena sirtuin, thd <dig>  could act directly on chromatin destined for degradation. thd <dig> selectively accumulated in the parental macronucleus  at the initial stage of chromatin condensation , and in later stages mapped precisely over the region of condensed chromatin within the macronuclear envelope . the mechanism for thd <dig> accumulation will be the focus of future studies. we speculate that thd <dig> plays a role in macronuclear degradation by directly modifying histones. while our hdac assay confirmed that thd <dig> is capable of deacetylating histones in vitro , it is also possible that this enzyme may target other substrates under biologically relevant conditions. other than histone h2ax and h2b phosphorylation, little is known about other modifications to apoptotic chromatin, but histone deacetylation appears critical in at least some cases. deacetylation of yeast histone h2b by the hos <dig> hdac  is required for apoptosis  <cit> , and apoptotic condensation in leukemia cells was linked with global histone deacetylation  <cit> , but the deacetylases remain unknown. given their involvement in heterochromatin formation at various genomic loci  <cit> , sirtuins are reasonable candidates for apoptotic chromatin modifiers. our combined results from nam-inhibition and thd <dig> localization provide the first evidence that a sirtuin acts on chromatin destined for degradation.

one intriguing feature of thd <dig> is its zinc finger domain, which is unusual to find on a sirtuin enzyme. its strong homology to the paz domain on hdac <dig> known to bind ubiquitin  <cit> , suggests that thd <dig> may interact with ubiquitin or ubiquitinated proteins, especially since it contains all of the essential binding residues  <cit>  . since ubiquitin plays a major role in apoptosis and labels proteins for degradation, the paz and sirtuin domains of thd <dig> may collaborate to make essential apoptotic modifications. although a single protein with both a sirtuin and paz domain has not been identified in higher organisms, thd <dig> may combine functions that higher-order organisms have evolved to handle with separate, more specialized proteins. to assess these possibilities, function of the putative paz domain and its potential role in nuclear degradation will be the subject of future studies.

results in this study showed that thd <dig> targeting was dependent on physiological state. in the nucleus of vegetatively growing cells, thd <dig> resided primarily in the multiple nucleoli positioned around the nuclear periphery, and in mitochondria. sirtuins in other organisms are known to act at nucleolar loci where they stabilize rdna repeats and factor into rna polymerase i transcription and rdna silencing  <cit> . interestingly, nutrient starvation dramatically increased thd <dig> expression , and caused thd <dig> protein to concentrate into a prominent focus, or aggregate, inside the nucleus . like nucleoli, this aggregate was often associated with the nuclear periphery and stained weakly with dapi . however, it was much larger than the typical nucleolar aggregates previously observed by electron microscopy  <cit> , and was ringed only around the periphery by the nucleolar protein nop <dig> . previous work showed that under certain gene over-expression conditions  the human sir <dig> homolog, sirt <dig>  is recruited to discrete nuclear foci with promyelocytic leukemia  protein, in "pml bodies" where it deacetylates proteins such as p <dig>  <cit> . similarly, thd <dig> may be sequestering with other nuclear proteins, possibly those involved in regulating cellular response to starvation stress.

our study raises the intriguing possibility that the sirtuin thd <dig> is specialized for the formation of irreversible heterochromatin functionally linked to parental macronucleus degradation, but not for reversible, facultative heterochromatin like meiotic chromatin in micronuclei. despite the elevated expression in pre-meiotic stages, thd <dig> did not localize to micronuclei at any point before or during meiosis, and formation of these two types of heterochromatin appears mechanistically different with respect to to histone modifications  <cit> . especially intriguing is that localization results suggest additional roles for thd <dig> in nucleoli and mitochondria. whether they relate to nuclear degradation mechanisms will be a focus of future studies. in one possible model consistent with the macronuclear autophagy process, thd <dig> is delivered specifically to the parental macronucleus from mitochondria that fuse with the nucleus prior to degradation, a mechanism previously shown to deliver other degradation factors such as endonucleases and aif  <cit> . such a model would explain the increased concentration of parental macronuclear thd <dig> in the absence of increased expression . regardless of its concentration mechanism, we expect future work to define a role for thd <dig> in promoting or coordinating macronuclear autophagy.

CONCLUSIONS
the sirtuin inhibitor nicotinamide prevents meiotic chromosome condensation, and normal progression of both chromatin differentiation and programmed nuclear degradation during development in tetrahymena, all of which depend on global chromatin condensation. one sirtuin, thd <dig>  resides in mitochondria, nucleoli, and in distinct nuclear sub-structures depending on physiological conditions and stages of the cell's life cycle. notably, thd <dig> accumulates in chromatin-rich regions of the degrading macronucleus during the chromatin condensation stage preceding global degradation. together, the nam-inhibition and thd <dig> localization studies suggest the first evidence that sirtuins act on chromatin destined for degradation in apoptotic nuclei.
