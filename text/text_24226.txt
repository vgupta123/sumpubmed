BACKGROUND
spinocerebellar ataxia type  <dig>  is a dominantly inherited, slowly progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of cta/ctg combined repeats  in the ataxin  <dig> opposite strand  gene located on chromosome 13q <dig>  <cit> . the reported repeat lengths associated with ataxia vary dramatically, ranging from  <dig>  <cit>  to > <dig> repeats  <cit> . in the general population more than 99% of the alleles have 16~ <dig> cr  <cit> . nevertheless the penetrance of the sca <dig> repeat expansion and ataxia is not complete, as expansions do not always segregate with ataxia in families and they are present in rare instances in normal and non-ataxic diseased populations  <cit> .

the pathogenesis of sca <dig> is complex. in addition to a ctg repeat expansion in the atxn8os gene, it also involves a cag repeat expansion in another overlapping gene, ataxin  <dig>   <cit> . in the ctg direction, atxn8os expresses non-coding transcripts containing the cug expansion which overlap with the 5' region of the kelch-like  <dig>  transcripts, and in the cag direction atxn <dig> expresses transcripts encoding a nearly pure polyglutamine expansion protein. as a consequence, three plausible mechanisms were proposed for sca8: rna gain-of function  <cit> , partial loss of klhl <dig> function  <cit>  and polyglutamine expansion protein in the cag direction  <cit> . in the present study, we focus on the rna gain-of function mechanism.

the causative agent for myotonic dystrophy  is also known to be a ctg expansion in the 3'-utr of the dmpk gene  <cit> . the expanded cug repeat in the dmpk rna impaired nuclear cytoplasmic transport, resulting in nuclear retention and ribonuclear foci formation  <cit> . in addition, expanded ctg repeats in dm <dig> alter the adjacent chromatin structure  <cit>  and several proteins bind to cug repeat-containing rna  <cit> . using pc <dig> neuronal cells expressing the cug repeat-bearing mrna, cis-effects through the reporter gene and neuronal death after cell differentiation in vitro were reported  <cit> . expression of a huntington's disease-like  <dig> jph <dig> transcript with an expanded cug repeat also resulted in the formation of rna foci and cell toxicity  <cit> . based on these previous studies, we established atxn8os stably induced hek- <dig> cell lines carrying  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr to investigate the possible epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulations of the atxn8os expression.

RESULTS
atxn8os cr cell lines
the pcdna5/frt/to vector and atxn8os constructs containing  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr were used to generate atxn8os cr cell lines. these cell lines were originated from human embryonic kidney  <dig> cells, which express many neuron-specific mrnas  <cit> . a large body of work on other repeat expansion diseases with similar neuronal pathology using this cell line has been reported  <cit> . the derived atxn8os cell lines are isogenic except for the number of cta/ctg combined repeats. the repeat number in these cell lines was stable . atxn8os rna levels were measured by real-time pcr quantification using atxn8os-specific probe and primers. the expression of the endogenous atxn8os rna in vector only cell line was too low to be efficiently detected. in the absence of doxycycline, all atxn8os cr cell lines expressed low level of atxn8os rna, ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  compared with endogenous hprt <dig> . a repeat length-dependent repression of atxn8os expression is notable. atxn8os  <dig> and  <dig> cr cells were more sensitive to staurosporine , an external apoptotic stimulus . a repeat length related increase in the number of annexin v-positive cells was also observed when the viability of these atxn8os cr cell lines was examined. annexin v binds phosphatidyl serine  located in the plasma membrane. ps is only accessible to annexin v during apoptosis when the ps moves from the inner to the outer plasma membrane, or during necrosis when membrane integrity is lost. in cr cells grown without doxycycline, while the absolute level of cell death was relatively modest, in  <dig> and  <dig> cr the number of dying cells was statistically significant amounting to ~ <dig> times that seen in the cells with  <dig> cr . in cr cells grown with doxycycline, cell death was also significantly increased, amounting to ~ <dig> times that seen in the cells with  <dig> cr .

repeat length-related change in atxn8os expression the induction of atxn8os rna levels were further examined in these cr cells . after induction with doxycycline for  <dig> and  <dig> days, the amount of atxn8os rna in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr cells increased significantly. when the amount of atxn8os rna present at the time of doxycycline addition was set to 100% for each cr cell line, the fold of induction increased with repeat length, with n/fold of induction being 0/29~ <dig>  23/25~ <dig>  88/41~ <dig>  and 157/47~ <dig> 

involvement of reduced atxn8os expression with histone modification
the expression of the atxn8os in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr lines was driven by the same hybrid cmv/teto <dig> promoter. as cug triplet repeat expansion in dm <dig> may alter the adjacent chromatin structure  <cit> , the observed repeat length-dependent repression of atxn8os expression may be due to chromatin remodeling. modifications of the h <dig> have been shown to induce a change in chromatin activity  <cit> . to examine the possibility that site-specific h <dig> modifications might regulate atxn8os expression with cug repeat expansions, chip-pcr analysis was performed using primary antibodies anti-dimethyl-h3-k <dig>  and anti-acetyl-h3-k <dig> . the methylation of h3-k <dig> in  <dig> cr cells was evident, but not in  <dig> or  <dig> cr cells . also hypoacetylation of h3-k <dig> was observed in  <dig> cr cells, but not in  <dig> or  <dig> cr cells .

repeat length-dependent repression of halotag gene located next to atxn8os cdna gene
the cloning vector used to generate atxn8os cr lines was modified by placing a halotag gene downstream of the atxn8os cdna gene. if chromatin structure was affected in expanded cr lines, reduced expression of halotag would be expected. to examine this, halotag rna level relative to endogenous hprt <dig> rna was first quantified by real-time pcr. as shown in fig. 4a, halotag rna expression in expanded  <dig> and  <dig> cr lines was significantly reduced to 70~71% when compared to the normal  <dig> cr line . to confirm the expression change, proteins were collected and subjected to western blotting with halotag and Î²-actin antibodies. consistent with the results of real-time pcr quantification, expression levels of halotag protein were significantly decreased in atxn8os  <dig> and  <dig> cr lines as compared to that of  <dig> cr line . fluorescence microscope examination after immunocytochemical staining using halotag antibody also revealed the reduced expression of halotag protein .

increased atxn8os transcript stability and ribonuclear foci formation with cug repeat expansion
to examine the observed repeat length-dependent increase of fold of induction, the effect of repeat length on the stability of atxn8os rna was investigated. the atxn8os cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline for  <dig> h and actinomycin d  was added to block transcription of new rna molecules. the stability of the atxn8os rna was then determined by real-time pcr quantification of the amount of atxn8os rna present in cells harvested at different time points after actinomycin d addition. the amount of atxn8os rna present at the start of the experiment immediately before actinomycin d addition was set to 100%. as shown in fig. 5a, using hprt <dig> mrna as an internal control, the levels of atxn8os mrna at  <dig> h after addition of actinomycin d in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr cells were  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. therefore, expanded cr causes stabilization of atxn8os mrna and subsequently reduces rna decay.

since the mutant dmpk and jph <dig> transcripts accumulated in the nuclei of patient cells and aggregated to form distinct foci  <cit> , we investigated whether the expanded atxn8os cug repeats form ribonuclear foci. the atxn8os  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> cr cells were grown in the presence of doxycycline and fish experiments using a cy3-labeled  <dig> oligonucleotide probe was performed two days later. as shown in fig. 5b, no ribonuclear foci were seen in cells expressing atxn8os  <dig> cr. however, distinct ribonuclear foci, mostly perinuclear, were observed in cells expressing expanded  <dig> and  <dig> cr. similar results were obtained using an oligonucleotide probe specific to atxn8os. since this probe can only bind to the atxn8os rna in single copy, the inability to detect ribonuclear foci with  <dig> cr is not an artifact of the copy number of the repeats in the  <dig> or  <dig> cr cells.

discussion
clinical and genetic studies have shown that sca <dig> is a slowly progressive inherited disorder with highly incomplete penetrance, in addition to its rare occurrence of phenotype in individuals carrying a much larger repeat expansion  <cit> . thus the pathogenic mechanisms underlying sca <dig> are expected to be complicated. in this study we developed a number of otherwise isogenic human cell lines expressing transcripts with 0~ <dig> cta/ctg cr. the repeat number in these cell lines was stable and expression of atxn8os rna containing expanded  <dig> and  <dig> cr causes an increase in the likelihood of cell death . these cells are also sensitive to staurosporine treatment which can induce apoptosis . this observation coincides with the reported length-dependent toxicity of untranslated cug repeats in cell and caenorhabditis elegans experiments  <cit> . these cells were used to investigate the possible epigenetic and post-transcriptional controls of the atxn8os expression. the implications of the findings in the pathogenesis of sca <dig> are discussed as the following.

epigenetic changes of atxn8os expression
previously expansions of ctg repeat in myotonic dystrophy and gaa repeat in friedreich's ataxia conferred variegation of expression on a linked transgene in mice  <cit> . silencing was correlated with a decrease in promoter accessibility and was enhanced by the classical position effect variegation modifier heterochromatin protein  <dig> , which is able to bind to methylated histone h3-k <dig>  <cit> . elevated levels of histone h <dig> dimethylated on k <dig> were also seen in friedreich's ataxia cells consistent with a repressive chromatin organization  <cit> . the "histone code" hypothesis proposed that amino-terminal extensions of histones are subject to a variety of posttranslational modification  <cit> . histone methylation and acetylation are among the best characterized modifications to regulate gene expression through alterations in the chromatin structure. in chromatin domains that are transcriptionally repressed, high levels of histone h3-k <dig> methylation and h3-k <dig> hypoacetylation were observed. therefore, it is possible to predict the transcriptional competence of a particular genomic region by examining the h <dig> methylation and acetylation patterns. using chip assay, we provided direct evidence of h3-k <dig> dimethylation and h3-k <dig> hypoacetylation and repression of atxn8os rna in the  <dig> cr cells . as reduced expression of adjacent halotag gene was also seen in the  <dig> cr cells  independent of h3-k <dig> dimethylation and h3-k <dig> hypoacetylation , dna methylation or other histone modifications such as arginine methylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation  <cit>  may be responsible for the observed repression of atxn8os rna in the  <dig> cr cells. nevertheless the epigenetic change induced by large sca <dig> repeat expansions may be one of the genetic factors that suppress the disease symptoms in control individuals carrying large sca <dig> repeat expansions. work is now in progress to examine the roles of hp <dig> and its associated regulators on the observed repeat-dependent repression of atxn8os expression.

increased atxn8os transcript stability and ribonuclear foci formation
previously it was reported that expanded cug repeat transcripts form stable hairpins  <cit>  and muscleblind and mbnl <dig> increase steady state levels of cug repeat rna  <cit> . the possibility of stable hairpin formation and proteins binding may explain the observation that expanded cr causes stabilization of atxn8os mrna , and in turn leads to repeat length-dependent increase in fold of atxn8os induction . in dm <dig> and dm <dig>  the expanded repeat rna forms discrete ribonuclear foci to sequester cug binding proteins and subsequently jeopardize the normal cellular functions of these proteins, which would then lead to abnormal rna splicing of several genes  <cit> . although the induced expression levels of atxn8os rna in these cr cells were low , ribonuclear foci were detected in our atxn8os  <dig> or  <dig> cr cells . most of the rna foci formed are located near nuclear membrane, which may be compatible with the observation by koch and colleague that the hairpin structure formed by long cug repeats  cannot pass through nucleic pores  <cit> . the ribonuclear foci observed in the nucleus may also result in transcriptional dysfunction to lead to the disease, as indicated by transcription factors leaching from chromatin by mutant rna in myotonic dystrophy  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our data provide evidence of epigenetic and post-transcriptional regulations of the atxn8os expression. although the in vitro cell culture study may not truly reflect the pathological events in vivo, our study may shed insights into the pathogenesis of this disease.
