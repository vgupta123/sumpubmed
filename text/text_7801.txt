BACKGROUND
the yeast s.cerevisae has become one of the most valuable model organisms for ageing studies. in this uni-cellular eukaryote, two distinct paradigms are used to measure longevity. the first, replicative life span  is defined as the mean or maximum number of daughter cells generated by individual mother cells  <cit> . the second, chronological life span  is a measure of the mean or maximum survival time of populations of non-dividing yeast  <cit> . yeast rls has been proposed as a model for the ageing of dividing cells of higher eukaryotes, whereas cls is believed to better model the ageing of post-mitotic cells  <cit> . rls was the first paradigm to be used for ageing studies. currently about  <dig> genes have been implicated in determining rls. in comparison, fewer genes have been shown to regulate the chronological ageing. recent studies have indicated three nutrient responsive yeast kinases: sch <dig>  pka, and tor, as major regulators of both types of ageing. sch <dig> is a yeast kinase homologous to mammalian serine/threonine protein kinase akt. inactivation of sch <dig> increases rls by 30–40%  <cit>  and extends cls by nearly three folds  <cit> . down-regulation of pka activity obtained by introducing mutations in ras <dig> and cyr <dig>  approximately doubles the cls of yeast  <cit> . recently, two high-throughput screenings were performed in yeast to identify genes that determine rls and cls, respectively. the first screening identified  <dig> gene deletions that increase rls, and  <dig> of them  correspond to genes encoding proteins in the tor pathways  <cit> . the other screening identified several tor-related gene deletions that increase cls  <cit> . in yeast, as well as in higher eukaryotes, sch <dig>  pka, and tor coordinate signals from nutrients to regulate ribosome biogenesis, stress response, cell size, autophagy, and other cellular processes  <cit> . of more importance, mutations that decrease the activity of the orthologs of these proteins in higher eukaryotes also extend life span, suggesting that the roles of these kinases in the regulation of life span are conserved along evolution  <cit> .

although the roles of sch <dig>  pka, and tor on life span extension are not fully understood, it is known that some stress response genes down-stream of these pathways are required for longevity. in the ras2Δ cells, the cls extension is mediated by stress resistance transcription factor msn <dig> and msn <dig>  which induce the expression of genes encoding for several heat shock proteins, catalase  and superoxide dismutase . transcription regulation of these genes by msn2/msn <dig> depends on the existence of a stress response element  in their promoter regions  <cit> . sod <dig> is required for life span extension in ras2Δ and sch9Δ and over-expression of sod <dig> extends longevity  <cit> . moreover, longevity in the sch9Δ cells depends on the activity of rim <dig> kinase  <cit> . the kinase rim <dig> is known to integrate signals from tor, pka, and sch <dig>  <cit> , and activates gis <dig>  a transcription factor, which regulates genes containing a pds  element and is involved in the induction of theromotolerance and starvation resistance by a msn2/msn4-independent mechanism  <cit> .

to better understand the function of sch <dig>  pka and tor kinases in yeast life span extension, we measured the gene expression profiles of wild type yeast as well as three long-lived mutants: sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ using the affymetrix microarray technology. in this paper, we aim to address the question: what are the transcription factors that are involved in the longevity of these mutants? a number of methods have been proposed to answer this question. a straightforward method is to identity a set of differentially expressed or co-expressed genes, and then search their promoter sequences for known transcription factor binding sites or use de nova motif finding method to identify enriched motifs  <cit> . however, results obtained by this method are sensitive to the selection of the reference set, the cutoff value and some other factors. to overcome this problem, a systematic and statistical approach called pap  is proposed, which suggests an integrated model considering all of the promoters and characterized transcription factors in a genome  <cit> . other two methods, reducer  <cit>  and motif regressor  <cit> , identify regulatory motifs in response to a condition by associating log expression value of a gene with the motif abundance or motif-matching score in its promoter region using a linear model. in this paper, we apply two systematic strategies, as does pap, to infer the regulatory transcription factor associated with longevity in sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ cells. the first strategy is based on motif analysis. we perform de novo identification of motifs from all the yeast promoter sequences and then test the enrichment of them in the up/down-regulated genes of long-lived mutants using gene expression in wild type yeast as control. the second strategy is based on the chip-chip data that measures the connectivity of transcription factors with genes. we seek the transcription factors that are significantly associated with up/down-regulated genes in the long-lived mutants. the schematic representation of our transcriptional inference in the long-lived yeast mutants is shown in figure  <dig>  according to our analysis, several transcription factors including msn2/msn <dig> and gis <dig> are likely to function at the down-stream of the sch <dig>  pka, and tor pathways and may account for the longevity of the corresponding long-lived mutants. furthermore, our analysis suggests that it is useful to combine microarray gene expression profiles with other data sources such as chip-chip data or promoter sequences to extract more biological information.

RESULTS
microarray data
we extract rna samples from day  <dig>  cells of wild-type as well as three long-lived yeast mutants: sch9Δ, tor1Δ, and ras2Δ, and measured expression levels of  <dig> genes using the affymetrix yeast <dig>  array. it should be noted that all these yeast strains are cultured in minimal medium sdc according to the standard methods for chronological life span measurement  <cit> . in the sdc medium, a substantial proportion of yeast cells are still dividing before day  <dig>  at older ages, such as day 3– <dig>  most of the cells become hypometabolic, which is associated with a dramatic drop in transcription. therefore, we harvest mrna at day  <dig>  so that we can extract enough mrna for microarray experiment while avoid the noise introduced by the transcriptional activities of dividing cells. we compute the log expression ratios for all the genes in each mutant with respect to the wild-type. the expression profile for sch9Δ, tor1Δ, and ras2Δ show strong similarity with one another, suggesting that sch <dig>  tor, and pka may control the expression of a common set of genes that are crucial for the chronological ageing.

motif enrichment analysis
we identify  <dig> putative regulatory motifs from sequences that include up to  <dig> bp upstream of all yeast genes. among these putative motifs,  <dig> can be associated with a transcription factor according to literature or database  <cit> . generally, if the activity of a transcription factor is changed as a consequence of some biological events, such as the deletion of sch <dig> gene, we will expect to see an enrichment of its binding motif in the promoter regions of up-regulated or down-regulated genes. motivated by this rationale, we performed enrichment analysis for these  <dig> putative regulatory motifs. first, we obtain the up-regulated and down-regulated gene sets for each mutant  by setting the threshold to  <dig>  fold. then, for each of these gene set, we test the enrichment of a given motif in their promoter regions. these tests are carried out for all the  <dig> predicted motifs and a p-value of enrichment significance is assigned to each motif. finally, we perform multiple testing corrections by calculating the corresponding q-values for all these enrichment tests.

in the up-regulated gene set for sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ , we identify  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> enriched motifs out of the  <dig> motifs, respectively, at a significance level of  <dig>  . if we set the significance level to  <dig> , the numbers of enriched motifs increase to  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. among these significant motifs,  <dig> can be associated with known transcription factors including msn2/msn <dig> and gis <dig>  in the down-regulated gene set for sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ , no motif is found to be enriched after multiple testing correction even at a significance level of  <dig> . the predominance of enriched motifs in up-regulated gene sets suggests that the life span extension of these mutants is mediated by activation rather than repression of some transcription factors.

significantly enriched motifs
other than fhl <dig>  msn2/msn <dig> and gis <dig> binding motifs, motifs associated with other transcription factors are also enriched in the up-regulated gene set of sch9Δ, ras2Δ or tor1Δ. for example, the binding motif of transcription factor hsf <dig>  which is also involved in stress response, is significantly enriched in ras2Δ   <cit> ; the binding motif of transcription factor mig <dig>  which is involved in glucose repression, is significantly enriched in ras2Δ   <cit> ; the binding motif of transcription factor sum <dig>  which is a dominant suppressor of mutant of silent information regulator genes, is significantly enriched in ras2Δ  and tor1Δ   <cit> . further studies of these transcription factors under the sch9Δ, ras2Δ, or tor1Δ background may shed new light on the mechanism of enhanced longevity in these mutants.

stability of enrichment analysis
to show the effect of threshold setting, we performed motif enrichment analysis using different threshold values for up-regulation and down-regulation. for a wide range of thresholds from 2-fold to  <dig> -fold, our analysis achieves similar results. first, the total number of significantly enriched motifs in the up-regulated gene set does not change much with different thresholds. secondly, we identify almost the same set of significant enriched motifs using different thresholds. thirdly, we do not identify any significantly enriched motifs in the down-regulated gene sets using all these threshold values.

as shown in figure  <dig>  gis <dig> and msn2/msn <dig> binding motifs exhibit significant enrichment in the up-regulated gene sets corresponding to different thresholds. generally, a smaller threshold results in larger up- and down-regulated gene sets, based on which the enrichment analysis is more reliable and sensitive. as shown in figure  <dig>  the significance level of motif enrichment increases with the decrease of the threshold, suggesting a higher sensitivity for larger gene set. on the other hand, the threshold should be high enough to ensure that most genes in the up- or down-regulated gene set reflect real biological expression difference rather than background noises.

chip-chip based analysis
in the motif enrichment analysis, those  <dig> motifs are identified from dna sequence using a de novo method. the presence of a motif in the up-stream region of a gene is determined computationally and many of them may not be functional binding sites of transcription factors. for example, based on the computation, we find that  <dig> out of the  <dig> yeast genes have at least one gis <dig> binding sites in their promoter  region. it is possible that the in silico method overestimates the number of genes regulated by a specific tf. if we know the target genes regulated by a transcription factor, we do not need to rely on computation methods for target gene identification and we may improve the accuracy of transcription inference.

the chip-chip experiment provides us with the information about the interaction between transcription factors and genes on a genomic scale. in yeast, the genomic occupancy of  <dig> transcription factors in rich media conditions was determined in a systematic chip-chip experiment  <cit> . for some of the transcription factors, their target genes in different experimental conditions, such as in heat shock, rapamycin treatment etc, were also determined. based on the chip-chip data, we define  <dig> gene sets, each corresponding to a transcription factor under a specific condition. among them,  <dig> gene sets correspond to target genes of these  <dig> transcription factors in ypd medium; the rest of them correspond to chip-chip results under other conditions. we performed gene set enrichment analysis  for these  <dig> transcription factor gene sets   <cit> . gsea analysis is a permutation based method to test if a set of genes tend to have high rank or low rank in a rank list, e.g. log expression rank list. in this work, we use gsea analysis to test whether genes in a tf gene set tend to have high or low log expression values. by using this method, we identify  <dig> tf gene sets that are significantly enriched in at least one of the three long-lived yeast mutants at a fdr of  <dig> . the accuracy of p-value assigned by gsea analysis depends on the number of permutations which can not be too large considering the computation complexity. to obtain a more accurate p-value and to infer whether a gene set is positively or negatively affected, we carry out the wilcoxon rank test to the  <dig> tf gene sets.

we compare the log expression values of genes in a tf gene set with the whole genome expression background  using the wilcoxon rank test. in comparison with the wild type, if the target genes of a transcription factor tend to be up-regulated in a long-lived mutant according to the test, then we may infer that the activity of this transcription factor is positively affected in the mutant. conversely, if the target genes of a transcription factor tend to be down-regulated, then we infer that the activity of this transcription factor is negatively affected. in total, we identify  <dig> positively affected tf gene sets involving  <dig> transcription factors from  <dig> chip-chip experiment conditions , and  <dig> negatively affected gene sets involving  <dig> transcription factors from  <dig> chip-chip experiment conditions . the chip-chip experiment conditions includes ypd , h2o2hi , h2o2lo , sm , acid , rapa , but <dig> .

among the positively affected transcription factors shown in table  <dig>  many are related to stress or drug resistance, such as msn <dig>  cin <dig>  pdr <dig>  smp <dig>  rim <dig>  yap <dig>  and xbp <dig>  for example, smp <dig>  positively affected in all of these long-lived mutants especially in sch9Δ and tor1Δ, was reported to be involved in regulation of the response to osmotic stress  <cit> . some cell cycle related transcription factors such as fkh <dig>  stb <dig>  swi <dig> and yap <dig> are also positively affected. sok <dig>  a negative regulator of cyclic amp-dependent protein kinase  <cit> , and nrg <dig>  a transcriptional repressor for glucose-repressed genes  <cit> , are highly affected in ras2Δ and moderately affected in sch9Δ and tor1Δ, suggesting that they may act down-stream of ras <dig>  sch <dig>  and tor <dig> to mediate the transcription response in low-nutrient environment. consistently with the results from motif enrichment analysis, we again find fhl <dig> to be positively affected in all the three mutants. moreover, two additional transcription activators for ribosome genes, rap <dig> and sfp <dig>  are also identified.

despite that many transcription factors are positively affected in the long-lived mutants, we identify only a few negatively affected tf gene set using chip-chip based analysis , similar to the results by motif enrichment analysis. hap <dig> forms a glucose-repressed complex with hap <dig>  hap <dig>  and hap <dig>  which functions as a global positive regulator of respiratory gene expression  <cit> . rtg <dig> involves in the retrograde regulation in response to a mitochondrial defect  <cit> . abf <dig> is a multi-functional global regulator for genes involved in a diverse range of cellular processes including carbon source regulation, nitrogen utilization, sporulation, meiosis, and ribosomal function  <cit> . gcn <dig> activates the expression of amino acid biosynthetic genes in response to amino acid starvation  <cit> . the decrease of activity of these transcription factors might reflect the reduced respiration and low metabolic rate in the long-lived mutants  <cit> . in support of this hypothesis, we find many genes involved the oxidative phosphorylation and the tca pathway  are down-regulated. interestingly, rtg <dig> and gcn <dig> are shown to be activated by tor inhibition in previous studies  <cit> . we note that our inference is about association but not about causality by nature. the inconsistency of our results with previous studies may indicates that confounding factors exist and further investigation is necessary to understand the complete story.

comparison of the two methods
the results from motif based analysis and chip-chip based methods are roughly consistent with each other in the following way:  the transcription factors identified by motif based analysis tend to have small p-values in results of chip-chip based analysis, and vice versa;  both methods identify much more positively affected transcription factors, whereas no or only a few negatively affected transcription factors are identified;  both methods suggest stress response transcription factors may play important roles in the chronological life span extension of the mutants;  the transcription activator fhl <dig> is found to be strongly associated with life span extension by both methods. on the other hand, there is also some inconsistency between the two methods, which may arise from the following reasons:  only about  <dig> motifs can be associated with known transcription factors according to literatures and transcription factor databases;  the binding information is not available for some transcription factors in the chip-chip data, such as gis1;  the binding targets for some transcription factors are condition-dependent and none of the condition in the chip-chip data match our microarray experiment condition perfectly. as more data sets related to transcription factors are available, we would expect to improve substantially the accuracy of the analysis. for example, a perfect match between the conditions for microarray and chip-chip experiment would improve the results. we could infer the activity of more transcription factors by using the motif based method with the accumulation of binding information in the transcription databases, such as the transfac  <cit> . fortunately, these kinds of data and information are accumulating rapidly and we can make more reliable inference based on new available data.

condition dependent of transcription factor binding
according to the genome-wide binding behavior across different conditions, transcription factors could categorized into four major classes: conditional invariant, conditional enabled, conditional expanded, and conditional altered transcription factors  <cit> . for conditional invariant transcriptional factors, their target gene are highly overlapped in different conditions and therefore the chip-chip result may be used to infer transcription for microarray data under other conditions. for example, fhl <dig> is shown, according to our analysis, to be associated with expression changes in the sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ mutants, although the condition and cell status of the microarray and chip-chip experiments are quite different. however, for some other transcription factors, the transcription inference of their activity depends strongly on the experiment conditions. table  <dig> shows the wilcoxon test results for msn <dig> and msn <dig> target gene sets corresponding to different chip-chip experiment conditions. as can be seen, the number of binding targets of msn <dig> and msn <dig> changes dramatically in different conditions and consequently their activity changes in the long-lived mutants inferred by the wilcoxon rank test are quite different. for example, msn <dig> is inferred to be positively affected in ras2Δ based on the chip-chip result under acid, h2o2hi, and h2o2lo conditions. but it is negatively affected, if the inference is based on chip-chip result under rapa condition. for these reasons, results based on chip-chip data should be carefully examined, but in at least two situations it would provide valuable information for transcription inference:  when the transcription factor of interest binds with a relatively invariant set of target genes in different conditions;  when the experiment conditions for chip-chip and microarray experiment are equivalent or similar.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated how to infer the activity modification of transcription factors in the long-lived mutants with respect to wild-type yeast by integrating microarray expression data with promoter sequence data and chip-chip data. both the motif and chip-chip data based analysis suggest that some transcription factors related to stress response or ribosomal genes may play important roles in the yeast chronological ageing. interestingly, based on our analysis, the activities of msn2/msn <dig> and gis <dig> are positively regulated in all the three mutants: sch9Δ, ras2Δ, and tor1Δ, which is consistent with previous studies. moreover, we find some other interesting transcription factors that may also involve in the transcription regulation at the downstream of sch <dig>  pka and tor pathways. finally, our analysis provides a framework for transcription inference by integrating microarray data with other data sources.
