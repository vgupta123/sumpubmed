BACKGROUND
protease-activated receptors  are g-protein-coupled receptors  with a unique mechanism of activation. these receptors carry their own tethered ligands and are activated by proteolytic activity of serine proteases  <cit> . among the four members of the par family, par <dig> and par <dig> are highly expressed in human oral keratinocytes   <cit> . par <dig> is activated by thrombin and par <dig> is activated by trypsin-like enzymes, including trypsin, mast cell tryptase and neutrophil proteinse- <dig>  <cit> . activation of pars by proteases of pathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, the gram-negative bacteria associated with periodontitis, suggests a role for pars and particularly par <dig> as a putative mediator of periodontitis  <cit> .

periodontitis is an infection of periodontal tissues which are the supportive structure for the teeth. in the complex structure of periodontal tissues, gingival epithelium is the first layer which encounters various periopathogens, acting as a physical barrier and playing an active role in innate immunity  <cit> . oral keratinocytes utilize par <dig> and par <dig> as part of their ability to sense their environment, and activation of these receptors induces up-regulation of several cytokines, chemokines as well as antimicrobial peptides  <cit> .

findings from our earlier study showed that activation of pars induced expression of cxcl3/mip-2b, cxcl5/ena- <dig> and ccl20/mip-3α in hoks  <cit> . cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> stimulate the chemotaxis of monocytes and neutrophils and both interact with the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig>  <cit> . ccl <dig> is strongly chemotactic for lymphocytes and dendritic cells and elicits its effect by activating chemokine receptor ccr <dig>  <cit> . these findings suggest that the major function of par <dig> and par <dig> in oral keratinocyte is to initiate and prolong innate immune responses via attraction of cells of the immune system such as leukocoytes and dendritic cells. understanding the signaling pathways downstream of par <dig> and par <dig> activation leading to such responses will help us better understand how innate immune responses are regulated in maintaining oral health.

in the current work, we studied differential signaling of par1- and par2-mediated innate immune responses in the induction of cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> via erk, p <dig> and pi3k/akt signaling. we hypothesized that the induction of these markers by par <dig> and par <dig> is differentially mediated by activation mapk and pi3k, and used selective inhibitors for components of these signaling pathways to study their effects on par signaling. the results provide a novel insight into signaling pathways involved in par activation.

methods
primary hoks isolation and cell culture
tissue preparation and cell culture method for primary hoks have been described previously in detail  <cit> . briefly, healthy gingival tissue samples from patients undergoing third molar extraction were collected for tissue culture with patients' informed consent and according to the procedures approved by university of washington institutional review-board. tissue samples were processed to dissociate the epithelium into single cells. for experiments, cells were grown in supplemented serum-free keratinocyte basal medium   and incubated at 37°c in 5% co <dig>  fourth passage cells at 75-80% confluence were used for all experiments. due to the possible variation between individual donors, we looked for consistent results in hoks from at least three donors with technical duplicate for each set of experiments, unless otherwise stated.

reagents used
human alpha-thrombin  and recombinant human trypsin  were used to stimulate hoks in order to activate par <dig> and par <dig>  respectively. d-phe-pro-arg-chloromethyl ketone dihydrochloride  and serine protease inhibitor, tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone  were used to inhibit thrombin and trypsin, respectively. inhibitors for erk1/ <dig>  and its control substance , p <dig> , pi3k , akt  were from calbiochem . rabbit polyclonal p <dig> mapk  and akt , and monoclonal phospho-p <dig> mapk , phospho-akt , p44/p <dig> mapk , and phospho-p44/p <dig> mapk  antibodies were obtained from cell signaling technology, inc. . mouse monoclonal gapdh, used as western blot control for equal gel load of protein, was purchased from santa cruz biotechnology inc. . as assessed by the limulus amebocyte lysate pyrotell , the thrombin  and trypsin  preparations in our study contained less than  <dig>  eu lps/ml.

rna isolation, reverse transcription and quantitative rt-pcr 
single-stranded cdna was synthesized from total rna and used to perform qrt- pcr with gene-specific primers as described previously  <cit> . unstimulated hoks and samples without rt served as negative controls. a melting curve was performed at the end of each qrt-pcr to ensure the gene product was specific. glyceraldeyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  was used as the selected housekeeping gene for normalization. the primer sequences for gapdh, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> have been described previously  <cit> . data were analyzed using pfaffl method to calculate fold change of gene expression  <cit> .

measurement of chemokines in culture supernatant
secreted cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> were measured in culture supernatant using duoset elisa kit . the absolute concentration in each sample was calculated based on sample yielding optical density using the standard curve. chemokine secretion from each condition was normalized to chemokine produced at baseline level in unstimulated control group, and results are presented as percent of unstimulated control cells.

elisa assay for quantification of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation
to assess phosphorylation of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  treated cells were homogenized in lysis buffer in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol . immediately prior to adding to cells, protease and phosphatase inhibitors, pmfs and sodium orthovanadate , halt protease inhibitor cocktail and halt phosphatase inhibitor cocktail , were added to the lysis buffer. phosphorylation of p <dig> and p42/ <dig>  was assessed in cell lysate using duoset antibody pairs following manufacturer's protocol . total p <dig> was quantified by a similar method  and served for normalization. total p <dig> was proportional to total protein measured in each sample and to the number of cells plated in each well.

western blot analysis
total and phosphorylated kinase expression in untreated and agonist-stimulated hok cells was determined by western immunoblot analysis. samples of whole cell lysate supernatant proteins, solubilized in 1x nupage lsd sample and reducing buffer, were resolved concomitantly with precision plus dual color protein molecular weight standard  in nupage 4-12% bis-tris mini gel  and mops sds running buffer in xcell surelock mini-cell, transferred to pvdf membrane  in xcell ii blot module using electrophoresis systems and protocols of invitrogen corp. . pvdf membranes were blocked for  <dig> h with 1% bsa, 1%pvp and 1% peg in wash buffer , then:  incubated with rabbit primary antibodies either overnight at 4°c for phospho-akt antibody, or  <dig> h at room temperature for total  and phospho- proteins  at concentrations recommended by the manufacturer, then incubated for  <dig> h with donkey anti-rabbit igg  hrp conjugate  diluted 1: <dig>  in  <dig> % tween- <dig>  tris buffered saline ; or  incubated with mouse monoclonal gapdh diluted 1: <dig>  in blocking buffer and then with goat anti-mouse igg  hrp conjugate  diluted 1: <dig>  in  <dig> %ttbs. secondary antibody binding to primary antibody was detected using supersignal west dura extended duration chemiluminescent substrate and protocols of thermo scientific . film exposures were chosen to give unsaturated blot densities. gapdh immunoblots showing equal gel load of protein were obtained without stripping. total protein immunoblots for akt, p <dig> mapk and p44/p <dig> mapk were obtained from separate gels loaded with  <dig> to  <dig> fold less protein. chemiluminograms of immunoblots were digitally scanned and saved in tiff format using photoshop™ software  without further processing.

statistical analysis
data collected from at least three donors are presented as mean ± standard error of the mean . data were compared using one-way anova followed by bonferroni post test. a p-value <  <dig>  was considered to be significant.

RESULTS
activation of pars modulates phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> in primary hoks
we examined the dynamic activation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> when cells were stimulated with thrombin and trypsin. elisa-based analysis showed a transient weak and rapid  phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> subsequent to both par <dig> and par <dig> activation. in par1-activated cells, the level of erk1/ <dig> activity was at its maximum within  <dig> min and then decreased and remained at a steady level close to baseline up to  <dig> min. in contrast, after its maximum phosphorylation at  <dig> min, par <dig> activation induced dephosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> to below the baseline level for up to  <dig> min . both par <dig> and par <dig> activation also induced phosphorylation of p <dig> within  <dig> min . the activation of p <dig> increased steadily and reached a maximum at 15- <dig> min. however, par <dig> activation resulted in a higher level of p <dig> phosphorylation than with par <dig> activation . these results were confirmed by western immunoblot analysis as well. neither par <dig> nor par <dig> was a strong inducer of erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation, either at times shorter than  <dig> min or between 5- <dig> min after stimulation . a striking change in phospho-erk1/ <dig> is induced by par <dig> activation, which causes dephosphorylation of phospho-erk1/ <dig> in  <dig> min. in accordance with elisa results, both par <dig> and par <dig> activation induced p <dig> phosphorylation, which was sustained up to  <dig> min . we next tested the effect of par <dig> and par <dig> activation on phorphorylation of akt . akt is a serine/threonine protein kinase and activated by stimuli that induce production of phosphatidylinositol -trisphosphate via activation of pi3k  <cit> . results show a rapid phosphorylation of akt in effect of par <dig> and par <dig> activation . these results suggest involvement of map kinases and pi3k/akt in cellular signaling downstream of par activation and identify distinct patterns of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk phosphorylation by par <dig> and par <dig>  phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> was subtle and transient, while p <dig> phosphorylation was prolonged. the kinetic analysis suggests erk1/ <dig> is more involved in par <dig> signaling, while p <dig> has greater participation in par <dig> signaling.

the innate immune markers induced by par <dig> and par <dig> activation are regulated by erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk
in our previous studies we found that thrombin induced cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> via par <dig>  while trypsin induced up-regulation of cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> via par <dig> activation  <cit> . in this study, we investigated the signaling molecules involved in the induction of these innate immune markers following par <dig> and par <dig> activation in hoks. as activation of par <dig> and par <dig> modulates phosphorylation of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  next we analyzed the role of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> in the par1- and par2-induced cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> mrna expression. inhibition of erk1/ <dig> by u <dig>  which inhibits the signaling molecule upstream of erk1/ <dig>  significantly blocked the expression of cxcl <dig> and cxcl <dig> induced by par <dig> activation, but had no significant effect on the induction of the three markers by par <dig> activation . inhibition of p <dig> by sb <dig> had a stimulatory effect at low concentration  on par1-induced cxcl <dig>  but the effect was attenuated at higher concentration . in the presence of the p <dig> inhibitor, par1-activated cells showed a decrease in cxcl <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner but there was no effect on ccl <dig> expression . in contrast, induction of all three markers by par <dig> activation was significantly blocked by the p <dig> inhibitor in a dose-dependent manner . the inhibitors on their own did not affect the expression of the selected markers . furthermore, the efficacy of the inhibitors was tested. immunoblot analysis showed a reduction in phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> in the presence of u <dig> and sb <dig>  respectively . these results suggest that both erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> are activated downstream of pars signaling to induce appropriate innate immune responses. expression of the selected markers of innate immunity induced by par <dig> activation is more dependent on erk1/ <dig>  in contrast, par <dig> signaling is more dependent on p <dig> in the induction of innate immune responses.

innate immune expression in response to par <dig> and par <dig> activation is enhanced by pi3k/akt inhibition
the pi3k/akt signaling pathway plays a role in coordinating defense mechanisms in innate immunity  <cit> . increased phosphorylation of akt suggested activation of pi3k/akt pathway downstream of pars. in order to determine its role in the regulation of selected innate immune markers mediated via par <dig> and par <dig>  we used selective inhibitors for pi3k. inhibition of pi3k by two specific inhibitors, wortmannin  and ly <dig> , induced a concentration-dependent enhancement of cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> mrna expression in par1- and par2-activated cells, thus suggesting that pi3k has an inhibitory effect on innate immune responses induced by both par <dig> and par <dig>  in order to confirm this negative regulatory effect of pi3k, we tested the effect of blocking akt on responses induced by par <dig> and par <dig> activation. blocking akt activity by akt inhibitor iv, which inhibits a kinase upstream of akt but downstream of pi3k, also resulted in an increase in expression of all three markers induced by par <dig> at higher doses of inhibition, and increased ccl <dig> expression induced by par <dig> activation . these results suggest that the pi3k/akt signaling pathway limits the innate immune responses activated by par <dig> and par <dig> 

secretion of cxcl <dig> in response to par <dig> and par <dig> activation is enhanced by pi3k/akt inhibition
a previous study reported inhibitory effect of pi3k signaling pathways following activation of toll-like receptor  <dig> by lps  <cit> . in our studies we confirmed no endotoxin contamination in thrombin and trypsin. however, in order to exclude the possibility that endotoxin contamination of inhibitors may be responsible for increased expression of innate immune markers, and also to test if increased induction of selected markers is associated with the secretion of mature proteins, we measured cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> in culture supernatant when cells are stimulated with thrombin and trypsin for par <dig> and par <dig> activation, respectively, or with the inactivated form of the enzymes in the presence of pi3k inhibitor. cxcl <dig> secretion induced by par <dig> activation was increased when pi3k activity was inhibited, and this effect was abrogated in the presence of ppack to block thrombin proteolysis. a similar pattern was observed for secreted cxcl <dig> induced by par <dig> activation, and the effect was abrogated in the presence of tlck to inhibit trypsin. however, secreted level of ccl <dig> did not change significantly in the presence of the pi3k inhibitor in either par1- or par2-activated cells . taken together, our data suggest that pi3k is a negative regulator of innate immune markers induced by activation of par <dig> and par <dig> 

inhibition of pi3k is associated with decreased erk1/ <dig> and increased p <dig> phosphorylation
since activation of mapk and pi3k signal transduction had opposite effects on innate immune responses induced by par activation in hoks, we hypothesized that pi3k has inhibitory effect on activation of erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> downstream of par <dig> and par <dig> signaling. we assayed the phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> at  <dig> min and p <dig> at  <dig> min  when pi3k activity was inhibited by wortmannin at various concentration and cells were stimulated with thrombin or trypsin for par activation. elisa-based assay suggested that in these conditions, inhibition of pi3k by wortmannin followed by par <dig> or par <dig> activation caused decreased phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in a dose-dependent manner . in contrast, inhibition of pi3k increased phosphorylation of p <dig> in response to par activation, and these effects were correlated with increased concentration of pi3k inhibitors . inhibition of pi3k by ly <dig> had similar effects as wortmannin on cells activated with trypsin, but had less potent effects on cells activated with thrombin . these findings were confirmed by western immunoblot analysis as well. as shown in figure 5e, inhibition of pi3k activity by wortmannin decreased phosphoylation of erk1/ <dig>  but increased p <dig> phosphorylation when par <dig> and par <dig> are activated. moreover, the efficacy of wortmannin in inhibition of pi3k is shown by decreased akt phosphorylation, downstream of pi3k . these results suggest that par <dig> and par <dig> activation leads to a crosstalk between activation of pi3k, erk1/ <dig> and p <dig>  and that inhibition of pi3k results in decreased activation of erk1/ <dig> but increased activation of p <dig> downstream of par signaling.

discussion
the transmission of signals from cell membrane into the nucleus requires coordinated action of diverse signaling proteins. in this study we identified the key signaling molecules involved in the induction of innate immunity in human oral keratinocytes in response to par <dig> and par <dig> activation. par <dig> and par <dig> have been demonstrated to activate members of the mapk signaling cascade in the induction of il- <dig> and il-1b in epithelial cells from different tissue origin  <cit> . in agreement with these reports, our findings indicated both p <dig> and erk1/ <dig> were phosphorylated by par <dig> and par <dig> activation. our findings further reveal that the induction of additional innate immune markers, cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig>  upon activation of par <dig> and par <dig> signals via p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  however, we observed divergent role for erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk in transducing signals for innate immunity by par <dig> and par <dig>  par <dig> signals via both p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  whereas the induction of similar chemokines by par <dig> is primarily via p <dig>  we also showed that pi3k activation had a negative regulatory role for both par <dig> and par <dig> signaling and thus may limit proinflammatory responses induced by proteases in the environment.

our kinetics studies demonstrated transient erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation by par <dig> and par <dig> activation, which was followed by a distinct pattern of erk1/ <dig> dephosphorylation. this was more prominent with par <dig> activation compared to par <dig> activation. this may explain the minimum effect of inhibition of erk1/ <dig> for par2-mediated innate immune responses. on the other hand, par <dig> activation, compared to par <dig>  resulted in more effective phosphorylation of p <dig>  these data suggest that dephosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> following par <dig> activation may be a protective mechanism against excess innate immune responses via p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  a similar protective effect by down-regulation of mapk signaling downstream of par <dig> activation is reported in acute pancreatitis induced by an intraperitoneal injection of caerulein in rats  <cit> . however, the mechanism of erk dephosphorylation by par <dig> activation is still unclear, and we are investigating whether par <dig> signaling mediates activation of phosphatases or if other mechanisms are involved.

inhibition of p <dig> also differentially affected the expression of selected markers induced by par <dig> and par <dig> activation with different sensitivity to the presence of inhibitor for each marker. this may be related to the involvement of different p <dig> subunits  with differential downstream signaling and also to the lack of the equipotency of the current inhibitor against all subunits  <cit> .

our studies suggest pi3k has an inhibitory effect on par signaling in hoks. this effect was shown most clearly at the mrna level and also for cxcl <dig> at protein level. we did not observe this effect in the secretion of ccl <dig>  which may be related either to the peptide structure of ccl <dig> which is vulnerable to proteolytic activity of enzymes, or to involvement of other mechanisms that affect ccl <dig> expression at the post-transcriptional level. little information is available about par-mediated pi3k signaling in normal human keratinocytes with comparable cellular function, but our results indicate hoks have a unique signaling system. it has been shown that thrombin signals via pi3k to induce osteoprotegerin in human periodontal ligament and vegf in human pigment retinal epithelial cells  <cit> . in a recent study minhajuddin et al. showed that pi3k/akt is involved in modulation of nf-κb and expression of icam- <dig> induced by thrombin in endothelial cells. their study suggested that activation of pi3k/akt leads to activation of mtor. while the over-expression of the catalytic domain of akt increases activation of nf-κb in the absence of mtor activity, restoring mtor signaling dampens activation of nf-κb and induction of icam- <dig>  <cit> . in an earlier study by this group it was reported that thrombin-mediated icam- <dig> induction relies on parallel activation of pi3k and pkc that converges at akt and induces activation of nf-κb  <cit> . in contrast to their findings, our results suggest a direct inhibitory role for pi3k/akt. these discrepancies may be explained by cell type-specific signaling mechanisms or different markers that have been investigated. our finding in hoks suggests pi3k acts as a compensatory mechanism which suppresses inflammatory responses. a similar inhibitory role for pi3k signaling in response to tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> activation has been reported in monocytes, dendritic cells and epithelial cells  <cit> , suggesting that pi3k may act as a balancing point to prevent excessive innate immune responses. it has been reported that pi3k knockout mice compared to their heterozygous littermates displayed increased levels of il- <dig>  il- <dig> and nitrite in response to tlr <dig> activation  <cit> . results from our study suggest that inhibition of pi3k/akt resulted in the up-regulation of innate immune markers cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig> and ccl <dig> via par activation in hoks.

our results suggest that the mechanism of crosstalk between pi3k and par signaling is via effect on phosphorylation of p <dig> and erk1/ <dig>  we observed inhibition of pi3k resulted in increased p <dig> phosphorylation even in the absence of external stimulants , and this effect was significantly greater when cells were stimulated with active enzyme versus inactive form of thrombin and trypsin. this finding suggested a specific role of par activation in the induction of a crosstalk between pi3k and p <dig>  this interaction between p <dig> and pi3k signaling pathways downstream of pars activation may serve as a protective strategy hoks utilize to keep innate immune responses in balance. activation of pi3k inhibits the induction of proinflammatory chemokines possibly by suppression of p <dig> mapk activation. when tlr <dig> is activated by flagellin in intestinal cells  <cit>  and in vegf-induced tissue factor in endothelial cells  <cit> , suppressive effect of pi3k has been observed. although we expected to see a similar relationship between erk1/ <dig> and pi3k activation, our studies showed blocking pi3k limited erk1/ <dig> activity and suggest that pi3k and erk signaling pathways are acting in series. other studies showed that inhibition of pi3k induced phosphorylation of erk1/ <dig> in intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with flagellin  <cit>  and in hepatic stellate cells activated with platelet-derived growth factor  <cit> . these studies may reflect that the interaction between pi3k and erk signaling varies depending on the stimulus and cell type.

our studies suggested that par <dig> signals via both erk1/ <dig> and p <dig>  but that erk1/ <dig> has a more prominent role. however, there was no role for either p <dig> or erk1/ <dig> in the induction of ccl <dig> by par <dig> activation, although its expression was increased when pi3k and akt were inhibited. it is likely that an alternative mechanism, which is independent of the erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> pathways, but still blocked by pi3k, is involved in the induction of ccl <dig> by par <dig> activation. this is consistent with our previous study showing that ccl <dig> induction by thrombin may occur via a mechanism other than par <dig>  <cit> .

induction of cytokines and chemokines by par activation leads to infiltration of mononuclear cells in the microenvironment of periodontal tissue  <cit> . this process is part of the initial recognition of danger in the environment and serves as an important protective function. while this primary immune response can protect the body against pathogenic factors, over-activity of these responses can become destructive and lead to progressive diseases. in periodontal diseases, exaggerated immune responses lead to excess inflammation, thus it is potentially important that oral keratinocytes keep immune responses in balance by shutting down the expression of proinflammatory genes. it is likely that crosstalk between p38-mapk and pi3k/akt signaling pathways plays a role in this process. downstream of par activation, pi3k has a suppressive effect on the regulation of chemokines, thus may act to minimize the potential negative consequences of over-activity of inflammatory responses. however, bacterial pathogens with ability to activate par could take advantage of this mechanism in gingival epithelium and dampen innate immune responses to increase the survival of pathogens, which will result in sustained infection. thus, it is necessary to consider both sides of the role of pi3k/akt in evaluating possible therapeutic targets. furthermore, understanding the molecular events associated with par signaling in keratinocytes may open new possibilities of intervention for mucosal inflammation such as periodontal diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
we demonstrated in this study that the induction of inflammatory responses by par <dig> and par <dig> is differentially regulated by erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> mapk signaling pathways. erk1/ <dig> and p <dig> are both involved in signaling via par <dig>  but p <dig> is more critical for signaling via par <dig>  pi3k has a negative regulatory role limiting proinflammatory gene expression induced by both par <dig> and par <dig>  we characterized crosstalk between pi3k/akt and mapk signaling pathways and the possibility of p <dig> phosphorylation as one of the mechanisms by which pi3k keeps innate immune responses in balance subsequent to par activation. a simple schematic overview of par signaling is summarized in figure  <dig>
