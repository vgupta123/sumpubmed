BACKGROUND
aspergillus flavus is one of the causative agents of ear rot in maize. although infection does not typically reduce yield in temperate environments, the grain can become contaminated with aflatoxin, a polyketide secondary metabolite produced by the fungus that is highly toxic to humans and animals even in minute amounts  <cit> . in the usa, action levels are 20–300 ppb for animal feed  <cit>  and  <dig>  ppb for aflatoxin in fluid milk products  <cit> . thus, aflatoxin contamination of maize poses a serious health and economic burden worldwide. one promising solution that would mitigate the damage is breeding for host plant resistance.

most of the known resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in maize has been found in tropical lines, typically with tuxpan or tuxpeño in their pedigree  <cit> . analysis of bi-parental mapping populations derived from a few of these tropical lines, including cml <dig>  <cit> , mp313e  <cit> , and mp <dig>  <cit> , has identified many quantitative trait loci  on all chromosomes but  <dig> and  <dig>  narrowing the qtl to single loci with major effects, however, has proved difficult. the qtl encompass large regions, exhibit low to moderate heritability, and are characterized by high genotype x environment interactions  <cit> . therefore, host plant improvement by introgression of resistance into temperate lines adapted to the major corn production areas in the us, china, and europe, has not been efficient.

a complementary approach to qtl mapping is association mapping, which relies on historical recombination events of many different lineages for the discovery of markers linked to the trait of interest. in a genome-wide association study  of maize aflatoxin resistance, an association mapping panel of  <dig> inbred lines was genotyped by sequencing  and phenotyped for aflatoxin content in testcrossed replicated field experiments  <cit> . whole genome association analysis of the data yielded eight single nucleotide polymorphism -trait associations that were better than the threshold set for the false discovery rate   <cit> . these eight snps fell within the sequence of two genes that had conserved domains for dna methyltransferase and c2h2-like zinc finger protein, and a third gene which was an expressed protein of unknown function. many more will have been missed, however, as many genes may be expressed only in specific genetic backgrounds, possibly because they are part of a pathway and rely on specific haplotypes at other loci. thus, the positive alleles of these resistance genes may only be useful when found in combination with the positive alleles of other genes in the same pathway.

in addition to missing true positives due to genetic background or environmental variation, the statistical power of gwas is limited by strict levels set for fdr and by insufficient numbers of high-frequency polymorphisms found in most panels. fdr helps compensate for multiple testing effects, since a single trait is tested for association against very large numbers of polymorphisms. the candidate gene method of association analysis aims to improve the odds of identifying the most important alleles by genotyping or resequencing only those genes considered to have a high probability of association with the phenotype of interest within the germplasm being tested  <cit> . this may be done to validate gwas results, or to find associations that gwas missed. many successful studies of candidate gene association analysis in maize have been published to improve traits like flowering time  <cit>  and kernel traits like starch production  <cit> , β-carotene content  <cit> , and provitamin a biofortification  <cit> .

metabolic pathway analysis focuses on the combined effects of many genes that are grouped according to their shared biological function. this is another promising approach that can complement the most significant snp-trait associations or give clues to the genetic basis of a trait  <cit> . although originally developed to study differences in gene expression data for medically important diseases  <cit> , pathway analysis has been used with association mapping to find biological insights missed when focusing on only one or a few genes that have the highest associations with the trait of interest. in addition, biologically relevant pathways can be used to determine candidate genes for association analysis or to interpret large data sets produced by other high-throughput approaches like rna sequencing, proteomics, and metabolomics.

pathway-based approaches are now used routinely to study human disease , but published reports on pathway analysis of gwas data in plants are still non-existent. combining the aflatoxin gwas data in a pathway analysis jointly considers all genetic sequences positively associated with a. flavus infection and aflatoxin accumulation resistance; thus, pathways may be highlighted which lead to mechanisms for fungal resistance and those that discourage fungi in the maize kernel from producing deleterious aflatoxin. identification of these genes will eventually lead to more efficient breeding procedures and development of maize hybrids with resistance to aflatoxin accumulation. a better understanding of pathways involved in resistance will also advance our broader understanding of plant defense mechanisms against other opportunistic saprobic fungi. therefore, the primary objective of this study was to identify metabolic pathways and pathway genes underlying aflatoxin resistance by accounting for linkage disequilibrium among snps from a large-scale gwas study. a second separate, but complementary objective was to identify genes within  <dig> kb of significant snp-trait associations whose effects for lowering aflatoxin recurred in multiple environments. unlike conventional gwas, this analysis emphasized multiple aspects of snp-trait associations rather than just significance and was performed because of the high genotype x environment variability exhibited by this trait. by synthesizing the combined results, we hope to better understand the relationships that connect metabolic pathway and non-pathway genes in maize aflatoxin resistance. the joint analysis of all genes in this manner is expected to uncover new mechanisms that improve resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in maize.

RESULTS
gwas
among the  <dig> inbred maize lines, tassel calculated snp-trait associations for  <dig>  snps  <cit> . of these,  <dig>  % of the snp allele calls were imputed from the regional haplotype. the range of association p, effect, and r <dig> values were  <dig> e− <dig> to  <dig> , − <dig>  to  <dig> , and  <dig> e− <dig> to  <dig> , respectively. sorting output of the linkage disequilibrium values between pairs of snps in ascending order by the position of snp  <dig> or  <dig> produced linkages from the reference snp in the upstream and downstream directions, respectively. due to size limitations, the tassel output files could not be included in the supplement but they are available upon request.

snp to gene algorithm for the pathway analysis
a plot of pairwise linkage disequilibrium values—log against r <dig> showed that the most significant linkages between a reference snp and its linked snp occurred for r2 >  <dig>  . based on this distribution,  <dig>  was chosen as the threshold to define linkage. the frequency of linkage types were:  <dig>  % unlinked ,  <dig>  % reference snp linked to single snp ,  <dig>  % reference snp linked to a snp block where the associations in the block had a majority effect sign, that is the majority of associations had either a positive or negative effect , and  <dig>  % where the block had no majority effect sign  . a comparison of the effect signs in linkage groups , showed that 84 % of the linkage types shared the same sign , while 16 % did not. the snp to gene algorithm was designed to account for all possibilities present.

the steps of the decision tree used to find the tagsnp and gene are detailed in fig.  <dig>  if there was no linkage , then the reference snp  was the tagsnp used to find the gene. for linkage type  <dig> , if snp <dig> and the linked snp  had the same effect sign, the snp with the maximum absolute value of the effect value  was designated as the tagsnp. if the snp <dig> and snp <dig> had opposite effect signs, the snp with the most significant association was assigned the tagsnp. for linkage types ≥  <dig> , two branches were possible depending upon whether the snp <dig> block had a majority effect sign or not. if yes, then the distance between snp <dig> and the snp <dig> block was examined. if the distance was ≤  <dig> kb then the tagsnp was the snp with the maximum |effect| among snp <dig> and snps in the snp <dig> block. if the distance was >  <dig> kb, then the tagsnp was the snp with the maximum |effect| from the snps in the snp <dig> block only. if the number of snps with positive and negative effect signs in the snp <dig> block was tied, then the effect sign of snp <dig> was used to break the tie and find the snp in the snp <dig> block with the maximum  or minimum  effect value. once the tagsnp was identified, the associated gene was assumed to be within  <dig> kb. this search distance was based on our finding that the majority  of linkages between two snps  was within  <dig> kb . rapid decay of average linkage disequilibrium is typical for maize, especially for tropical germplasm, and has been studied in detail by romay et al.  <cit> . the association p, effect, and r <dig> values of the tagsnp were then assigned to the located gene. a total of  <dig>  tagsnps were used to locate  <dig>  genes.fig.  <dig> decision tree to find the tagsnp and gene for the gwas results based on linkage disequilibrium values. the tagsnp is at the terminal branch of the tree, snp <dig> is the reference snp, snp <dig> block is a block of snps linked to snp <dig> , and snp <dig> is a found snp within the snp <dig> block based on the decisions made by the algorithm. the values of the association effect and significance  were obtained from the gwas. once a tagsnp was identified, it was assumed that the gene causing the association was within  <dig> kb



validity of the gwas to pathway pipeline
kernel color, which is a trait known to involve the pathway pwy-6475- <dig> , was used to test the performance of the gwas to pathway pipeline. all steps were similar to those used for the pipeline for aflatoxin resistance except  the trait was fraction of yellow kernels, where  <dig> was all yellow and  <dig> was all white, and  the gene effect scores were ranked from yellow to white for the enrichment score calculation. the top two pathways found in this verification analysis were pwy- <dig>  and the expected pathway, pwy-6475- <dig> . pwy- <dig> was a one step oxidation of the precursors  to the corresponding acid that had  <dig> genes contributing to the enrichment score. the involvement of this pathway in kernel color is unknown, but the yellow pigment of corn kernels are carotenoids and abscisic acid is biosynthesized from c <dig> carotenoid precursors. the expected pathway, pwy-6475- <dig>  has  <dig> sequential reactions that begin with two molecules of geranylgeranyl diphosphate, which are condensed by phytoene synthase to phytoene, the first committed step of carotenoid biosynthesis. based on the ranks of the effect values, there were three of seven genes that contributed the most to the enrichment score. the genes and their maizecyc enzyme annotations were : grmzm2g <dig> , grmzm2g <dig> , and grmzm2g <dig> . these three genes were unique to pwy-6475- <dig>  that is their reactions were not mapped to any other maizecyc pathway. further, psy <dig>  which confers yellow color to endosperm, has been shown to be essential for carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . therefore, the test results appeared to support the validity of our gwas to pathways analysis.

the normalized enrichment score, p, q, and gene count for the  <dig> top ranking pathways  are listed in table  <dig>  a summary of the gene identifiers belonging to these pathways with their tagsnps, association statistics, and alleles are provided . the jasmonic acid  biosynthesis pathway  was by far the most significant . ja is a cyclopentanone oxylipin biosynthesized through the allene oxide synthase  branch of the lipoxygenase  pathway  <cit> . our results indicate that the allelic variation found among the genes involved in the biosynthesis of ja were critical for determining the level of resistance to aflatoxin contamination in kernels.

ja signaling has known roles for increasing resistance to necrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . plant-derived oxylipins like 13s-hydroperoxyoctadecadienoic acid  and 9s-hpode are known to mimic fungal oxylipins  <cit>  and induce increased conidiation and increased production of aflatoxin when applied to cultures of aspergillus species  <cit> . although our analysis did not examine how the allelic variation affected kernel levels of ja, fatty acid precursors, or other 9- and 13-lox derivatives, it is conceivable that resistance was correlated with changes in flux to the various branches of the lox pathway that favored ja biosynthesis over other oxylipins.

increases in foliar levels of ja have also been associated with defense against herbivores. in a comparison of herbivore-resistant  and susceptible  lines of maize, higher foliar levels of ja and the cyclopentenone intermediate, 12-oxophytodienoate, were found in the resistant line with levels increasing after exposure to fall armyworm larvae  <cit> . maize is similar to other plants in that exogenous application of ja to leaves induced the accumulation of defense-related compounds like phytoalexins, mimicking the accumulation observed after fungal inoculation or wounding  <cit> . in addition, the timing of the increase in endogenous ja levels after damage and fungal inoculation have supported a role for the ja signaling pathway in initiating localized plant defense mechanisms  <cit> .

pwy- <dig> had  <dig> genes contributing to the calculation of the enrichment score in  <dig> reaction types. the first reaction  is the oxidation of the fatty acid, α-linolenate to form 13s-hpode by lox. step  <dig>  forms the epoxide,  <dig> -epoxylinolenate. this reaction is unique to pwy- <dig> and can be catalyzed by hydroperoxide dehydratase , aos, and cytochrome p <dig> . the epoxide, being unstable, undergoes cyclization by allene oxide cyclase  to produce the cyclopentenone intermediate 12-oxophytodienoate . reduction in step  <dig> by 12-oxophytodienoate reductase  is followed by addition of coenzyme a  and three rounds of β-oxidation  to produce jasmonyl-coa. step  <dig> is a dehydrogenation reaction  catalyzed by acyl-coa oxidase , acyl-coa dehydrogenase , and dodecenyl-coa isomerase  that produces the corresponding trans enoyl-coa. in step  <dig> , water is added to the enoyl group, and in step  <dig> , dehydrogenation converts the hydroxyacyl-coa to the keto-acyl-coa. thiolytic cleavage in step  <dig>  forms an acyl-coa that is two carbons shorter. hydrolysis removes the coenzyme a moiety , and a configuration change at one of the two stereocenters  ends the pathway with the formation of the prohormone -jasmonate. the reactions lacking evidence in maize are catalyzed by ec  <dig> . <dig> in step  <dig> , ec  <dig> . <dig>  in step  <dig> , and the conformation change in step  <dig> 

most significant pathway genes
for each of the nine reaction types of pwy- <dig> with evidence in maize, there was at least one gene that had an associated tagsnp with a negative effect value for decreasing aflatoxin contamination . thus, there was at least one allelic variant for each of these nine steps in the ja biosynthesis pathway that conferred an incremental decrease to levels of aflatoxin observed among the association panel. genes that contributed the most to the enrichment score  appear in table  <dig>  they were mapped to steps  <dig>   <dig>  and 6– <dig> . genes for all three loxs , hd , and acaa all fell within previously described qtl for resistance to aflatoxin contamination in maize  <cit> . interestingly, the gene for hd fell within a cluster with ech <dig> and lox <dig> on chromosome  <dig> . a suspected gene cluster in this region was reported by mideros et al.  <cit> , whose meta-analysis of several previous qtl mapping studies found  <dig> independent qtls,  <dig> in bins  <dig> – <dig>  and  <dig> in bin  <dig> , with the largest-effect qtl in bin  <dig> . acaa was common to three other pathways .fig.  <dig> relative positions of the genes in pwy- <dig> on the maize chromosomes. thick vertical lines depict chromosomes 1– <dig> . genes with notations were associated with a tagsnp and contributed to the enrichment score calculation. notations: *gene had a negative effect value, **gene had p <  <dig>  and effect < − <dig> , † gene had a positive effect value. numbers to the left of the chromosome refer to the pathway step catalyzed. genes that lacked notations did not contribute to the enrichment score because they lacked polymorphisms among the lines in the association panel or lacked sequenced reads from the region. see text for abbreviations of gene function and ec number of the reaction catalyzed

functional analysis of heterologously expressed lox <dig> from maize showed that it is a non-traditional lox exhibiting both 9- and 13-lox activities  <cit> . in maize seedlings, lox <dig> gene expression is induced by wounding and exogenous application of methyl jasmonate  <cit> . when gene expression levels of lox <dig>  lox <dig>  and aos <dig> were quantified in mp <dig> compared to tx <dig>  all three exhibited constitutively higher expression levels in the resistant line compared to the susceptible line before and after 24 h of feeding by fall armyworm, but relative fold changes were about an order of magnitude higher for lox <dig>  <cit> . other studies have demonstrated that chloroplast-localized lox <dig>  <cit>  and lox <dig>  <cit>  are responsible for wound-induced ja production in maize leaves. lox <dig> has no known functional role, but shares highest sequence homology with lox <dig>  <cit> , a 13-lox that provides precursors for the production of the green leaf volatiles , as well as semiochemicals that recruit predators and parasites to the wounded area. in addition, lox <dig> mediates ja production by lox <dig> because lox <dig> is dependent upon signaling from lox10-derived oxylipins  <cit> .

even though the remaining pathways in table  <dig> had fdr values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , several could be associated with decreasing levels of aflatoxin because of their relationships with ja. among the biologically active forms of ja, ja-isoleucine is the most potent signaling form  <cit> . this may explain why we detected pwy- <dig> , branched chain-aa-syn-pwy , and thresyn-pwy . the first two pathways produce isoleucine, and the third produces threonine, a precursor for isoleucine biosynthesis.

detection of pwy- <dig>  in table  <dig> may have occurred because divinyl ethers are oxylipin secondary metabolites, biosynthesized through the divinyl ether synthase branch of the lox pathway  <cit> . in potato, divinyl ethers inhibit growth of the fungal pathogen, phytophthora infestans, and accumulate more in resistant than susceptible cultivars  <cit> .

another compound involved in defense is glutathione, a potent antioxidant that is induced by ja in response to oxidative stress  <cit> . glutathione can also influence basal levels of ja gene expression and ja signaling strength  <cit> . these roles may explain the associations of two pathways that provide precursors for glutathione production, the argasedeg-pwy, which produces glutamate, and the sulfate-cys-pwy, a superpathway for sulfate assimilation and cysteine biosynthesis .

other pathways that had possible associations because of their roles in plant defense are pwy- <dig>  and pwy- <dig>  . both are phenylpropanoid derivatives found in plant cell walls. the phenolic acid, 4-hydroxybenzoate, accumulates along with other aromatic compounds after pathogen infection  <cit> . levels of chlorogenic acid , one of the most important antimicrobials found in cell walls, can be constitutively isolated from resistant cultivars or induced by pathogen infection depending upon the plant species  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
although resistance to aflatoxin accumulation in maize kernels is a quantitative trait with high genotype x environment variability, we were able to apply gwas data to a pathway-based approach, which groups genes based on their shared biological function, to find genetic differences that distinguish resistant and susceptible lines of maize. most notably, we determined that the allelic variation found among the genes involved in the biosynthesis of ja were highly associated with the levels of aflatoxin observed among the panel of  <dig> inbred lines examined. moreover, we detected at least one allelic variant for each of the nine reaction types in the ja biosynthesis pathway that conferred an incremental decrease to the overall levels of aflatoxin observed. we were also able to identify non-pathway genes with putative defense-related functions in our second approach, which used a conventional gwas analysis, but emphasized snp-trait associations that consistently lowered aflatoxin levels in multiple environments. knowledge gained from these two complementary analyses has improved our understanding of population differences in aflatoxin resistance and, following additional verification, will provide markers for host plant improvement by introgression. to this end, the candidate gene method of association analysis and the construction of near isogenic, transgenic, or mutant plants will be employed to validate the more important alleles identified and how they affect aflatoxin accumulation.
