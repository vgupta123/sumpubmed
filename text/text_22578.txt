BACKGROUND
box c/d snornp complexes are involved in pre-rrna cleavage and in 2′-o-methylation of nucleotides at specific positions in rrnas, snrnas, and other rnas during maturation  <cit> . in yeast, these complexes are formed by snornas that contain conserved sequences , and four core proteins, nop <dig>  nop <dig>  nop <dig> and snu <dig>  in addition to these proteins, some other factors may associate with specific snornp, such as the u <dig> snornp  <cit> . snornp complexes are conserved from archaea to eukaryotes, although in the latter they are more complex  <cit> .

the assembly of snornp is initiated in the nucleoplasm and completed in the cajal bodies in mammalian cells, whereas in yeast, the final steps of assembly and maturation of snornps are considered to occur in the nucleolus, a compartment where the snornps also catalyze the rrna modifications  <cit> .

during snornp assembly, snu <dig> binds rna by recognizing a conserved rna secondary structure that is present in box c/d snornas, as well as in the u <dig> snrna  <cit> . due to its affinity to rna, the human orthologue of snu <dig>   <dig> kd, has been shown to be the first core snornp subunit to bind box c/d snornas  <cit> . although the later steps of assembly are less well defined, it has been shown that nop <dig> and nop <dig> bind the snornas independently, whereas nop <dig> depends on nop <dig> for binding the complexes  <cit> . due to the many structural rearrangements that occur during assembly, chaperones may be important for the maturation of snornps.

nop <dig>  also known as pih <dig>  has been shown to strongly interact with nop <dig>  <cit>  and with the chaperone hsp <dig>  <cit> . through its interaction with hsp <dig>  nop <dig> was identified as part of a complex named r2tp   <cit> . rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> are atp dependent helicases, belonging to the class of aaa+ atpases  <cit> , that form heterohexamers in vitro and participate in processes ranging from dna repair, transcription, chromatin remodeling, ribosomal rna processing, to small nucleolar rnp formation  <cit> . the human orthologues of rvb1/rvb <dig>  tip48/tip <dig>  have also been shown to be involved in box c/d snornp assembly  <cit> .

tah <dig>  a tpr -containing protein associated with heat-shock protein hsp <dig> has been shown to bind directly to hsp <dig>  <cit> . nop <dig> binds to the hsp90-tah <dig> complex and has been proposed to control hsp <dig> atpase activity  <cit> . the structures of the interaction regions of tah1-hsp <dig> and tah1-nop <dig> have been determined, and a model was proposed, according to which the tah <dig> tpr domain adopts a highly folded structure, whereas the c-terminal region of tah <dig> only folds upon its interaction with nop <dig>  <cit> .

nop <dig> interacts with proteins involved in various cellular processes  <cit> , probably helping the assembly of different complexes. the role played by nop <dig> in snornp assembly depends on its interaction with hsp <dig> as part of the r2tp complex. despite the studies on the interactions between the r2tp complex and hsp <dig>  and the determination of the structure of the complex, the molecular function of nop <dig> remains elusive.

rsa <dig>  although not a subunit of the r2tp complex, has also been shown to be involved in box c/d snornp formation through its interaction with snu <dig> and with nop <dig>  <cit> . it has been proposed that rsa <dig> binds immature snornp particles and is released upon assembly of the mature protein subunits of the complexes for their active conformation  <cit> .

r2tp also interacts with the prefoldin complex, which participates in protein folding, degradation and rearrangements  <cit> , broadening the range of protein interactions of the r2tp complex, and therefore, of nop <dig>  in this work, we describe further studies on the interactions between nop <dig> and the r2tp complex, and between nop <dig> and the box c/d snornp core subunits. through the analysis of the interaction of a nop <dig> point mutant with tah <dig>  we were able to narrow down the interface regions of these proteins, and also analyzed the effect of the presence of atp on the interaction of the rvb1/ <dig> atpase with nop <dig>  in addition, we mapped the region of nop <dig> involved in the interaction with nop <dig>  based on the data presented here, we propose a model for the role of r2tp in snornp assembly.

RESULTS
interactions of nop <dig> within r2tp complex
nop17/pih <dig> was identified as part of the r2tp complex, together with rvb <dig>  rvb <dig>  and tah <dig>  <cit> . in this complex, nop <dig> has been shown to interact directly with tah <dig> in pull-down assays  <cit> , and with rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> in the two-hybrid system  <cit> . in order to analyze in more detail nop <dig> interactions with r2tp subunits, two-hybrid and pull-down assays were performed. nop <dig> showed interaction with rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> in the two-hybrid system when fused to both domains: the lexa dna binding domain, and the gal <dig> transcription activation domain . interaction between rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> was also positive in both fusions. as expected, rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> show higher affinity for each other in the two-hybrid assay than for nop <dig> . since rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> are atpases  <cit> , to determine whether atp binding or hydrolysis may affect the interaction between these proteins and nop <dig>  pull-down assays were performed with recombinant proteins in the absence or in the presence of either atp or adp. the results show that the interaction nop17-rvb <dig> is independent of atp or its hydrolytic product, whereas nop <dig> only interacts efficiently with rvb <dig> in the absence of atp . these results are interesting because they suggest that nop <dig> may interact directly with rvb <dig>  independently of rvb <dig> or atp. despite the direct binding of nop <dig> to rvb <dig>  this interaction is hindered by the presence of atp or adp.figure  <dig>

experiments with deletion mutants of nop <dig> have shown that its c-terminal portion is important for the interaction with tah <dig>  <cit> . to further analyze the region of nop <dig> responsible for its interaction with tah <dig> and other proteins, we performed random in vitro mutagenesis in nop <dig> gene fused to lexa dna binding domain and tested the interaction of the mutants with gal4ad-tah <dig> in the two-hybrid system. a nop <dig> mutant was obtained that no longer interacts with tah <dig>  this mutant has an asparagine to serine substitution in position  <dig>  . western blot results show that bd-nop <dig> is expressed in l <dig> cells, although in lower levels than bd-nop <dig> . interestingly, a very recent report on the structure of nop17-tah <dig> interaction domains show that n <dig> is part of a beta sheet in nop <dig> cs domain, interacting with tah <dig> c-terminal region  <cit> . further studies will reveal how this mutation might affect nop <dig> structure in order to disrupt the interaction with tah <dig>  molecular modeling analysis suggests that the asparagine to serine substitution in the position  <dig> might affect the intramolecular interactions in the nop <dig> cs domain .

rsa <dig> and tah <dig> affect nop <dig> stability
previous studies have shown that tah <dig> interaction is important for nop <dig> stability  <cit> . we therefore tested the expression levels of nop <dig> in the Δtah <dig> strain. in addition, due to rsa <dig> involvement in snornp formation  <cit> , we also tested nop <dig> in the Δrsa <dig> strain. since the strains Δnop <dig> and Δrsa <dig> are temperature sensitive, we tested nop <dig> levels at the permissive and restrictive growth temperatures. the results show that nop <dig> levels decrease in Δrsa <dig> at 25°c, and are even lower at 37°c . interestingly, in Δtah <dig> strain, nop <dig> levels are very low, regardless of the temperature of growth, suggesting that the interaction with tah <dig> is more important for the stability of nop <dig>  and also suggesting that nop <dig> may not be found in the cell in a free form, but only bound to tah <dig>  either in the r2tp complex, or in a ternary complex with hsp <dig>  further confirming that the interaction with tah <dig> is important for nop <dig> stability, the steady-state level of the mutant nop <dig> is lower than that of the wild type protein . interestingly, deletion of rsa <dig> also leads to the destabilization of nop <dig> . nop <dig> shows a half-life of 90 min in wt cells, but it decreases to 55 min in Δrsa <dig> strain at 37°c. these results show that rsa <dig> also plays a role in nop <dig> stability.figure  <dig> 
absence of rsa <dig> or tah <dig> destabilizes nop <dig>   total extract from cells growing either at the permissive , or restrictive  temperature to od <dig>  <dig>  were used for western blot with serum against nop <dig>  steady state levels of nop <dig> do not change in wild type cells, whereas in Δrsa <dig> and Δtah <dig> strains, nop <dig> levels decrease drastically.  wt and Δrsa <dig> cells were treated with cyclohexamide after incubation to od <dig> of  <dig>  at 37°c. samples were collected at the indicated time points and subjected to western blot for the detection of nop <dig>  ponceau staining of the membranes was used as control for total protein loaded on gels.



nop <dig> is important for nop <dig> stability
nop <dig> interacts directly with nop <dig> and is important for the assembly of the box c/d snornp particle, probably by directing hsp <dig> chaperone to the particle  <cit> . considering Δnop <dig> temperature sensitivity, and the involvement of nop <dig> in targeting hsp90-tah <dig> to client proteins, those client proteins might be destabilized in the absence of nop <dig> at higher temperatures. to test this hypothesis, prota-nop <dig> levels were assessed in Δnop <dig> strain and compared to wild type cells. nop <dig> has been shown to be unstable in vitro  <cit> , therefore, in order to detect the protein, immunoprecipitation was performed using igg-sepharose beads. the results show that full-length prota-nop <dig> can be visualized in the bound fraction from wild type cells, but the protein is destabilized in Δnop <dig> strain, resulting in breakdown products that are detected in the bound fractions . to test whether higher levels of the chaperone could stabilize nop <dig>  hsp <dig> was overexpressed together with nop <dig> in either wild type or Δnop <dig> strains. the results show that in the absence of nop <dig>  nop <dig> is unstable, regardless of the overexpression of the chaperone , suggesting that indeed nop <dig> is required for directing hsp <dig> to its client protein nop <dig>  these data are also in agreement with the model of nop <dig> being an hsp <dig> co-chaperone, responsible for inhibiting its atpase activity, which is important for the loading of client proteins onto hsp <dig>  <cit> . accordingly, loss of tah <dig> and rsa <dig> has the same destabilizing effect on nop <dig> seen in Δnop <dig> strain . the effects of these latter proteins on nop <dig> could be indirect, and depend upon nop <dig> interaction with nop <dig>  these results corroborate the hypothesis of nop <dig> being important for directing hsp <dig> to nop <dig>  and thereby, to the box c/d snornp complex.figure  <dig> 
nop <dig>  tah <dig> and rsa <dig> affect nop <dig> stability. total extract from cells expressing either prota or prota-nop <dig> were used in immunoprecipitation assays. samples from input  and bound  material were analyzed by western blot for the detection of prota-nop <dig>   expression of prota or prota-nop <dig> in strains wt and Δnop <dig>  band corresponding to full-length  prota-nop <dig> can only be detected in samples from wt cells. in samples from Δnop <dig>  break-down products  from prota-nop <dig> are visualized. nop <dig> was used as an internal control for input samples and was not co-immunoprecipitated with prota-nop <dig> under the conditions used.  the same experiment as in a was performed with samples from cells overexpressing hsp <dig>   immunoprecipitation of prota or prota-nop <dig> expressed in Δrsa <dig> or Δtah <dig>  depletion of rsa <dig> or tah <dig> also destabilizes nop <dig> 



nop <dig> and rsa <dig> affect the interaction between nop <dig> and u <dig> snorna
interestingly, despite being less stable upon depletion of the r2tp complex, nop <dig> shows higher affinity for box c/d snorna in the absence of nop <dig>  <cit> . a similar, though weaker, effect is seen in the absence of rsa <dig> , suggesting that the recruitment of hsp <dig> and its co-chaperones is important for the correct binding of nop <dig> to the snornas. a decrease in the stability of nop58-snorna interaction might be required for the assembly of the other box c/d core subunits onto the complex.figure  <dig>

to determine whether nop <dig> binds snorna at an early or late stage of snornp assembly, chip assays were performed with different pairs of primers for the analysis of three regions of the u <dig> snorna gene. the results show that nop <dig> binds u <dig> snorna co-transcriptionally in the exon  <dig> region, where the conserved c/d are located . corroborating the previous results, nop <dig> bound snorna with higher affinity upon depletion of either nop <dig> or rsa <dig> .

the structure of the archaeal complex nop58/nop <dig> orthologues has been determined  <cit> . from the structure of the archaeal complex and the analysis of protein interactions with rna, it has been suggested that the c-terminal region of nop <dig> is involved in the interaction with rna and the protein l7ae, the central coiled-coil region is important for the nop <dig> dimerization, while the n-terminal portion interacts with fibrillarin  <cit> . taking into account the protein sequence conservation and the complexes formed in archaea and eukaryotes, the information from the archaeal complex can be used to infer that the c-terminal portion of nop <dig> is responsible for its interaction with snornas. as shown here and previously, nop <dig> co-immunoprecipitates box c/d snornas more efficiently in the absence of nop <dig> or rsa <dig>   <cit> , suggesting that nop <dig>  which interacts directly with nop <dig>  might compete with rna for the interaction with the c-terminal portion of nop <dig>  we therefore used the two-hybrid assay to map the region of nop <dig> involved in the interaction with nop <dig>  the results show that nop <dig> interacts with the c-terminal region of nop <dig>  but not with the n-terminal, or the central domains of nop <dig> . although we cannot exclude the possibility that n-terminal portions of nop <dig> may not interact with nop <dig> due to lower protein levels, we consider that unlikely because the region of nop <dig> responsible for its instability is a highly charged kkd/e domain located at its c-terminal portion  <cit> . our results therefore suggest that either nop <dig> can compete with rna for binding to nop <dig>  or that upon interacting with nop <dig>  nop <dig> has its affinity for rna decreased. to test the hypothesis of nop <dig> competing with rna for binding nop <dig>  we performed rna co-immunoprecipitation assays with prota-nop <dig> expressed in Δnop <dig> strain, and added increasing amounts of recombinant gst-nop <dig> during the assay. the results show that the snorna u <dig> co-purified with prota-nop <dig> is not released in the presence of the purified nop <dig> . these results suggest that nop <dig> does not compete with rna for binding nop <dig> in vitro. it is also possible that only the complete r2tp complex may affect nop58-rna interaction.figure  <dig>

nop <dig> interacts with other box c/d snornp subunits in addition to nop58
we have previously shown that snu <dig> interacts with all the other three core subunits of box c/d snornps, but it does not interact with nop <dig> in the two-hybrid system  <cit> . to determine the snornp assembly step in which nop <dig> is involved, we performed protein pull-down experiments with recombinant snu <dig>  nop <dig> and nop <dig>  in these experiments, his-nop <dig> is efficiently pulled down with gst-snu <dig>  but not with gst . interestingly, his-nop <dig> can be co-precipitated with his-nop <dig> when the latter is bound to gst-snu <dig> . these results suggest that nop <dig> can bind the heterodimer snu13-nop <dig>  but not the isolated proteins. this can be an indication that nop <dig> interacts with these two proteins after they bind the snorna, already as part of the snornp assembly complex. nop <dig> might be brought to the complex by its interaction with nop <dig>  decreasing the affinity of nop <dig> for the snorna and allowing for the assembly of nop <dig> and snu <dig> onto the complex. the hydrolysis of atp by rvb1/ <dig> atpases may cause a structural rearrangement necessary for the release of the r2tp complex and formation of the mature box c/d snornp.figure  <dig>

nop <dig> and rsa <dig> affect u <dig> snorna localization
the role of r2tp, and particularly of nop <dig>  in the assembly of box c/d snornp suggests that there might be an order of binding of the proteins to the snorna and molecular rearrangements for the formation of the mature complex. therefore, the depletion of the r2tp subunits might not only cause a mislocalization of the box c/d proteins, as has been demonstrated for nop <dig>  <cit> , but also of the snornas. to test this hypothesis, we performed fish experiments to determine the u <dig> snorna localization in the deletion strains Δnop <dig>  Δrsa <dig>  and Δtah <dig>  compared to the wild type strain growing at the permissive or non permissive temperature. the results show that in the absence of nop <dig> or rsa <dig>  u <dig> snorna is still concentrated in the nucleolus at 25°c, but when the cells are shifted to 37°c, the snorna signal becomes more disperse throughout the cells . surprisingly, however, depletion of tah <dig> did not seem to affect the localization of u <dig> snorna. these results indicate that in the absence of nop <dig> or rsa <dig>  the assembly of box c/d snornp is defective, mainly at the non-permissive temperature, leading to the mislocalization of the snorna. interestingly, as pointed out above, absence of nop <dig> has the same effect on the box c/d core proteins  <cit> , confirming the importance of this protein for the assembly of snornp. because the localization of u <dig> snorna is not strongly affected by the depletion of tah <dig>  these results also suggest that its function might be redundant with that of another hsp <dig> co-chaperone.figure  <dig>

discussion
nop17/pih <dig> is a nucleolar protein  <cit>  that has been shown to be part of the r2tp complex, interacting with rvb <dig>  rvb <dig>  and tah <dig>  <cit> . rvb <dig> and rvb <dig> are atp dependent helicases thought not to be present in isolated form in the cell, but instead they may form a heterohexameric complex containing three molecules of each protein  <cit> . this complex shows higher helicase activity in vitro than the isolated proteins, and undergoes nucleotide-dependent conformational changes  <cit> . based on the results shown here, it can be hypothesized that nop <dig> binds more tightly to one of the conformations of rvb1/rvb <dig> complex, thereby modulating the activity of the complex.

nop <dig> has been shown to interact with tah <dig> through its c-terminal region  <cit> , it was therefore important to determine whether point mutations in the c-terminus of nop <dig> affect its interaction with tah <dig>  as shown here, substitution in the position  <dig> of nop <dig> abolishes its interaction with tah <dig>  interestingly, these results are corroborated by the recent determination of the structure of the nop17-tah <dig> interaction domains  <cit> . amino acid  <dig> is part of a beta sheet in the interaction pocket of nop <dig> with tah <dig>  the amide to oh change in the n306s mutant might disrupt the interaction with the c-terminal segment of tah <dig>  <cit> . whereas the c-terminal region of tah <dig> interacts with nop <dig>  its n-terminal tpr domain interacts with hsp <dig> c-terminal peptide meevd  <cit> . tah1-hsp <dig> interaction might be stabilized by the interaction between nop <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit> .

as shown here, tah <dig> is important for the stability of nop <dig>  this stabilization may be due to the interaction with the c-terminal region of nop <dig>  similar results have been shown for the human orthologues of these proteins  <cit> . the destabilizing effect on nop <dig> was not seen, however, when a nop17-flag fusion was used, probably due to the protein fusion  <cit> .

tah <dig> is specific for hsp <dig> and affects its atpase activity as well as substrate binding  <cit> . it is interesting, therefore, that in the absence of either nop <dig> or tah <dig> the box c/d core subunit nop <dig> is destabilized. more importantly, as shown here, the depletion of rsa <dig>  a protein proposed to function as a scaffold for snornp assembly  <cit> , also leads to the destabilization of nop <dig>  confirming the importance of the r2tp interaction with hsp <dig> and rsa <dig> for the proper assembly of the functional snornp complex.

according to the model of rsa <dig> being a scaffold for the snornp assembly  <cit> , nop <dig> would bind the snornas only after it is directed to the box c/d particle by the r2tp complex. as shown here, however, nop <dig> binds u <dig> snorna co-transcriptionally, and binds snorna more stably in the absence of nop <dig>  <cit> . we, therefore, favor a model according to which nop <dig> binds snorna with very high affinity, but in order for the snornp complex to be matured, this interaction must be destabilized so that nop <dig> can interact with nop <dig> and allow for nop <dig> to bind box d and d’ . the structure of the pih domain of hnop17/pih1d <dig> interacting with a target peptide dsdd has been determined, and it has been shown that this interaction is dependent upon the phosphorylation state of the peptide dsdd  <cit> . interestingly, nop <dig> has this conserved peptide in the c-terminal portion involved in the interaction with nop <dig> . it remains to be determined whether the serine  <dig> is phosphorylated, and whether its phosphorylated state changes upon snornp assembly.figure  <dig> 
model of the role of the r

tp complex in the assembly of box c/d snornp. snu <dig> binds early during the assembly, and nop <dig> binds the snorna cotranscriptionally. the association of the r2tp complex and hsp <dig> chaperone are important for the conformational change of nop <dig>  necessary for the binding of the nop <dig> and snu <dig> to form the mature snornp particle that will participate in rrna maturation. in the absence of r2tp subunits, nop <dig> is less stable, but shows higher affinity for rna. in addition, in the absence of r2tp, snornas and core snornp subunits mislocalize in the cell.



the model for box c/d snornp assembly proposed here is also supported by the observation that core box c/d snornp subunits have been shown to be important for snorna localization  <cit> . further corroborating this hypothesis, the depletion of nop <dig> or rsa <dig> causes a mislocalization of the snorna u <dig> 

during the final preparation of this article a study was published on the r2tp complex  <cit> . that study reports the increased interaction of r2tp with nop <dig> in the absence of rna, and the importance of r2tp on nop <dig> stability. in that report the nop <dig> regions involved in the interaction with nop <dig> were also mapped. in addition, they showed that the dissociation of rvb1/ <dig> from nop17/tah <dig> was induced by nucleotide binding rather than atp hydrolysis. those results are consistent with the data shown here. we show complementary data of the stronger interaction between nop <dig> and rna in the absence of r2tp. additionally, we show that nop <dig> does not compete with rna for binding to nop <dig>  confirming that rna is not necessary for the nop17-nop <dig> interaction. the data shown here also complement those because we narrow further down the region of nop <dig> responsible for the interaction with nop <dig>  as shown here, that region is enclosed between amino acids  <dig> and  <dig>  we can therefore conclude that the 389– <dig> portion of nop <dig> is responsible for that interaction. interestingly, this region comprises the peptide dsdd, recently shown to interact directly with the pih domain of nop <dig>  <cit> .

we show that the levels of full-length nop <dig> decreases upon depletion not only of nop <dig>  but also of rsa <dig> and tah <dig>  interestingly, and according to the model of nop <dig> directing hsp <dig> to the target proteins, as shown here, the over-expression of hsp <dig> in Δnop <dig> strain does not stabilize nop <dig>  here we show that the interaction between nop <dig> and rvb <dig> is not affected by nucleotide binding or hydrolysis, contrary to the interaction with rvb <dig> which is affected by the presence of atp. our results, therefore, corroborate and complement those recently published.

CONCLUSIONS
nop <dig> interacts with the c-terminal portion of nop <dig>  affecting its affinity for snorna, nop <dig> stability, and the localization of the box c/d snornp components, both protein and rna moieties. tah <dig> and rsa <dig> affect nop <dig> stability, and might therefore affect nop <dig> indirectly. these results indicate a key role played by nop <dig> in snornp assembly, and suggest a stepwise process that requires molecular rearrangements of the proteins for the binding of all subunits and formation of the mature snornp.
