BACKGROUND
tomato  is a model plant for studying fleshy fruit development. fruit development post anthesis can be divided into four major stages—fruit set, cell division, cell expansion and ripening . early fruit growth in tomato, usually referring to the growth within 2– <dig> weeks after anthesis, is characterized by rapid cell division and drastic cell expansion. for example, in the small-fruited wild tomato species s.pimpinellifolium the cell number of pericarp is doubled within 2 days post anthesis  and cell division ceases around  <dig> dpa, whereas cell expansion starting as early as  <dig> dpa contributes to the remaining fruit growth  <cit> . therefore, fruit size largely determined by cell number and cell size is defined predominantly during early fruit growth. in addition, cell expansion during early fruit growth also contributes to the major changes in fruit structure and its biochemical and physiological properties. several genes regulating the formation of important agricultural traits in tomato have been shown to exert their actions during early fruit growth  <cit> . for example, ovate and sun, two major quantitative trait loci  controlling fruit shape and the major fruit weight locus fw <dig>  execute their functions mainly during early fruit development . the cell wall invertase gene lin <dig> also regulates the formation of solid soluble content during early fruit growth  <cit> . several studies of gene expression profiling using microarray have revealed that during tomato fruit set and early growth more than  <dig> genes are differentially expressed , indicating that complex transcriptional regulation, especially of genes related to cell division and hormone biosynthesis and perception, is involved in early fruit growth.

regulation of gene expression is perceived at multiple levels including transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. alternative splicing  of precursor message rna , which can generate a number of different transcripts from individual multi-exon genes, is one of the important regulatory mechanisms at post-transcriptional level in eukaryotes . as may increase transcriptome complexity and expand genome’s protein coding capacity, having a profound impact on protein functionality, stability and expression levels  <cit> . by analysis of expressed sequence tags  and rna-seq data, as events with various frequencies have been detected in many eukaryotes, including yeast, fungi, plants and animals . for example, it has been estimated that more than 95 % of the human multi-exon genes undergo as  <cit> . in plants, it has been estimated that 40–63 % of multi-exon genes undergo as . recently, chamala et al. have performed a survey on as patterns in different plant species by computational analysis of est, mrna and short reads from public available rna-seq data, and found that depending on species,  <dig> – <dig>  % of multi-exon genes produce at least one splice variants in nine plant species including tomato , medicago truncatula, soybean , common bean , rice , arabidopsis thaliana, poplar , grape  and amborella  <cit> .

as plays important roles in many biological processes, especially in response to environmental stresses  <cit> . also, as is regulated by developmental processes and by external stimuli, such as light  <cit> , temperature  <cit> , salt  <cit>  and pathogens  <cit> . wang et al. using rna-seq assessed the genome-wide changes of as events during arabidopsis flower development, and found that as patterns are similar between different developmental stages  <cit> . they reported that about 25 % of the expressed multi-exon genes underwent as and  <dig> splice variants were differentially expressed, indicating that as is regulated by floral development. developmental regulation of as events has also been confirmed in maize leaf and poplar xylem  <cit> . despite the recent advance in identification of organ-specific as events and in developmental regulation of as in few model plants, the as landscape during fruit development has not yet been obtained from tomato, a model plant for studying fleshy fruit development.

to investigate the as patterns of early growth fruits, we applied strand-specific rna-seq to analyze the genome-wide as events in tomato tissues including seedlings, flowers and early growth fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa, and compared the as patterns in fruits between three characteristic stages of early fruit growth. we found  <dig>  % of expressed multi-exon genes underwent as in at least one of these tissues investigated. furthermore, the study revealed that there were more splice variants per gene detected in early growth fruits than in seedlings and flowers. we also identified  <dig> genes showing differential splicing during early fruit growth. in addition, we identified  <dig> new transcription regions  unlinked to any annotated chromosomal segments, providing a rich resource for future functional genomic analysis in tomato.

RESULTS
identification of as events in early fruit development
early fruit growth in tomato is characterized by active cell division and cell expansion  <cit> . to investigate the genome-wide as events in early fruit growth, we performed an rna-seq analysis on the young developing fruits of s.pimpinellifolium la <dig> at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa in three biological replicates. in la <dig>  the three time points represent three distinctive stages of early fruit development:  <dig> dpa is the time when fruit set is completed and cell division has concurrently started; at  <dig> dpa, cell division almost ends; and at  <dig> dpa, the fruits undergo extensive cell expansion. in addition, rna-seq was also conducted on seedlings of la <dig> and s.lycopersicum cv heinz <dig> as well as anthesis flowers of s.lycopersicum la <dig>  the three samples were sequenced in one replicate in similar depths with the young fruits . the three additional samples were included to access the overall as patterns in other genotypes and tissues, and the two seedling samples were also used to evaluate the as detection by mapping of the reads from la <dig> to the reference genome of the cultivated tomato heinz <dig> because there is no annotation yet for the sequenced la <dig> genome. it is thought that reads from la <dig> samples can be readily and has been successfully mapped to the heinz <dig> reference genome because of the small nucleotide divergence between the two genomes . strand-specific transcriptome libraries were constructed and sequenced on a miseq platform. in total,  <dig>  million paired-end reads of high quality in 250 bp length were obtained from the twelve libraries and used for gene expression analysis and as detection based on the work flow outlined in fig.  <dig>  the reads were mapped by tophat <dig>  to the tomato reference genome   <cit> . on average,  <dig>  % concordant read pairs were uniquely mapped and were kept for further analysis .table  <dig> summary of read mapping

fig.  <dig> the flow chart of gene expression analysis and as detection used in this study. following mapping of the reads to the reference genome , the mapped reads were assembled by cufflinks. the cufflinks tools cuffdiff was used for identification of differentially expressed genes at gene level and differential alternative splicing. cuffnorm was used for estimating expression levels of individual transcripts assembled by cufflinks . then a very conservative cutoff  > =4) was used to select differentially expressed splice variants. as events were extracted from the merged  or individual  gtf generated by cufflinks using the web server tool astalavista. for ntr analysis, transcripts assembled by cufflinks  were compared to the annotated itag <dig>  transcripts and then novel transcripts were analyzed by sequencher



we then used cufflink program  to assemble the aligned reads and to access the transcriptome complexity in early growth fruits. expression values at gene and isoform levels were estimated based on fpkm . we detected a total of  <dig>  genes  expressed in at least one of the  <dig> samples . in general, the numbers of expressed genes in seedlings, flowers and fruits range from  <dig>   to  <dig>  ; the lowest and highest numbers were from  <dig> and  <dig> dpa fruits, respectively . based on the current annotation, about  <dig>  %  of the predicted tomato genes have multi-exons. among them,  <dig>   genes were expressed in at least one of these samples. there were similar numbers of multi-exon genes expressed in seedlings, flowers and young fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa . in the six different tissues, we were able to detect  <dig>  splice events from  <dig>  multi-exon genes, meaning that  <dig>  % of the expressed multi-exon genes were alternatively spliced . overall, the six tissues had  <dig> –46 % genes that underwent as; a slightly fewer as events were detected in the  <dig> dpa fruits and the  <dig> dpa fruits had a relatively higher percentage of genes that underwent as . although there were similar numbers of genes that underwent as in seedlings, flowers and young fruits, the averaged numbers of splice variants per gene were higher in fruits than that in seedlings and flowers—the fruits produced  <dig>  to  <dig>  splice variants per gene, compared to  <dig>  and  <dig>  in seedlings and flowers, respectively . if combining the as events found in all these samples, there were  <dig>  splice variants per gene, indicating that multi-exon genes produce tissue-specific splice variants.fig.  <dig> as events identified in seedlings, flowers and early growth fruits. a numbers of expressed genes in seedlings, flowers and early growth fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa. genes with expression values equal to or higher than  <dig>  fpkm in at least one samples were considered expressed. b numbers of expressed multi-exon genes that underwent as. c frequencies of as events in seedlings, flowers and early growth fruits. d as events per gene in seedlings, flowers and early growth fruits. 2d fruits represent  <dig> dpa fruits, 5d fruits for  <dig> dpa fruits, 10d fruits for  <dig> dpa fruits



splice variants are mainly generated by intron retention , alternative splice donor , alternative splice acceptor , exon skipping  and by a combination of the abovementioned four mechanisms. to further investigate the as patterns of seedlings, flowers and fruits, we used the online tool astalavista to extract the as events from the gtf files generated by the cufflinks program   <cit> . the as events in young fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa were combined using the merged gtf file from the mapped fruit-derived reads. among the as events identified, ir is the most abundant type , followed by aa , ad  and es  . there are also considerable as events  containing more than one of the abovementioned four as types. overall, the seedlings of la <dig> and heinz <dig> showed similar as patterns with la <dig> flowers, whereas the fruits had a higher frequency of mixed as types  and lower percentages of ad and es types, implicating increased complexity of as events during early fruit growth. the similar percentages of genes that underwent as and distribution of as types between la <dig> and heinz <dig> seedlings also indicate the as detection by mapping of the reads from la <dig> fruits to heinz <dig> genome is feasible.fig.  <dig> frequencies of as types in seedlings, flowers and fruits. a frequencies of different as types detected in the seedlings of s.pimpinellifolium la <dig>  b frequencies of different as types detected in the seedlings of s.lycopersicum cv heinz <dig> . c frequencies of different as types detected in the anthesis flowers of s.lycopersicum la <dig>  d frequencies of different as types detected in la <dig> fruits. type information of as events was extracted from astalavista outputs. as events in the fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa were combined. ir, intron retention; aa, alternative acceptor; ad, alternative donor; es, exon skipping; others, as events with more than one of the four basic types

fig.  <dig> validation of as events in different tissues by rt-pcr. twenty-two multi-exon genes that underwent as were validated by rt-pcr. rt-pcr analysis was performed on multiple tissues including those used for rna-seq. eif4α <dig> was used as control. sl, s.lycopersicum cv heinz1706; sp, s.pimpinellifolium la <dig>  nort, negative control using reaction mixture without reverse transcriptase added as templates. genomic, genomic dna of la <dig> as pcr templates. m, dna marker 2 k plus ii . ir, intron retention; aa, alternative acceptor; ad, alternative donor; es, exon skipping; others, as events with more than one of the four basic types. function description and primer information for the  <dig> genes can be found in additional file 8: table s5



to validate the as events detected by rna-seq, we performed a reverse transcription-pcr  analysis on  <dig> multi-exon genes producing the five types of as events using rna samples isolated from seedlings, flowers and fruits at different developmental stages. we were able to detect the expression of these splice variants in multiple samples, and further found that several splice variants showed tissue-specific expression patterns . for example, both of solyc03g <dig> and solyc05g <dig> had one splice variant only expressed in the fruits at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa, but not in seedlings and flowers . moreover, the rt-pcr analysis showed that the as events detected in the la <dig> samples were also found in seedlings or flowers of cultivated tomato, except those only expressed in fruit tissues.

genes showing differential splicing during early fruit development
further using the cufflinks tool cuffdiff, we identified  <dig> differential splicing genes which their as patterns were significantly changed during early fruit development. the  <dig> genes can be clustered into three different sets based on the expression patterns of their major mrna isoforms. set a contains ten genes showing differential splicing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa, eight genes in set b showed different splicing behaviors between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa fruits, and set c has nine genes displaying differential splicing only between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa . most of the  <dig> genes encode proteins that are likely involved in transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes and maintenance of protein stability. for example, solyc01g <dig> and solyc05g <dig>  encoding a 26s proteasome regulatory subunit and the t-complex protein  <dig> subunit gamma, respectively, are likely required for protein degradation and protein folding. in addition, solyc03g <dig>  encoding the mediator of rna polymerase ii transcription subunit  <dig>  also showed differential splicing. interestingly, a upf <dig> like gene  displayed differential splicing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa fruits. upfs are thought to be important regulators of nonsense-mediated decay  of premature termination codon-containing  transcripts generated by as. this indicates that alternative splicing of some nmd pathway components is regulated by early fruit development.table  <dig> gene showing differential splicing during early fruit development



we then checked the expression patterns of the individual mrna isoforms of the  <dig> differential splicing genes in early developing fruits. although the  <dig> genes produced 1– <dig> alternatively spliced mrna isoforms, they all had only 2– <dig> major isoforms expressed at relatively high levels in early growth fruits . for example, the upf <dig> like gene solyc10g <dig> produced eleven isoforms, but only two isoforms were expressed predominantly during early fruit growth and they had opposite expression patterns. in many cases, the annotated transcripts were expressed either constantly or at low level in early developing fruits. in contrast, their splice variants were differentially expressed during early fruit growth.fig.  <dig> expression values of mrna isoforms of differential splicing genes during early fruit growth. a three representative genes showing differential splicing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. b three representative genes showing differential splicing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. c three representative genes showing differential splicing between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. expression values of individual isoforms in fpkm were estimated by cuffnorm. description of the nine representative genes can be found in table 2




differentially expressed splice variants during early fruit growth
at gene level, there were  <dig> genes differentially expressed  during early fruit growth, of which  <dig> and  <dig> genes showed differential expression between two consecutive stages of early fruit development, respectively . but as shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file 1: figure s <dig>  some splice variants showed different expression patterns from its annotated transcript. we then investigated the expression patterns of individual isoforms in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa fruits. in these young developing fruits, a total of  <dig>  splice variants were detected. expression level below  <dig> fpkm is thought to be beyond the limit of protein detection . by applying the very conservative cutoff of expression values at  <dig> fpkm, we found a total of  <dig>  splice variants were expressed in these tissues. among them, there were  <dig> and  <dig> splice variants from a total of  <dig> annotated multi-exon genes showing expression changes by four folds or higher between two consecutive stages at  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpa; these splice variants were considered to be differentially expressed during early fruit growth . when applying the same criteria to the annotated transcripts, only  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes were differentially expressed, indicating that gene expression during early fruit growth is regulated at multiple layers and expression of splice variants is highly modulated .

interestingly, we found that at gene level the majority of differentially expressed genes during early fruit growth showed significant changes in expression values from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, but only a small portion of them were also differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa . in contrast, more than two-thirds of the differentially expressed splice variants had significantly altered expression levels at the three stages . the results further demonstrated that as functions as an important layer of gene expression regulation during early fruit growth.fig.  <dig> overrepresented go terms of differentially expressed genes in early growth fruits. a a venn diagram representing the numbers of differentially expressed genes during early fruit growth. b a venn diagram representing the numbers of differentially expressed splice variants during early fruit growth. c enriched go terms for differentially expressed genes during early fruit growth. d enriched go terms for genes with differentially expressed splice variants during early fruit growth. go: <dig>  protein binding; go: <dig>  nucleotide binding; go: <dig>  transporter activity; go: <dig>  catalytic activity; go: <dig>  hydrolase activity; go: <dig>  oxygen binding; go: <dig>  carbohydrate metabolic process; go: <dig>  transport



several fruit size and shape genes have been shown to exert their functions during early fruit growth. for example, the sun  gene encoding an iqd protein family member defines fruit shape early during fruit development and is expressed at higher levels concomitantly  <cit> . three isoforms of sun mrna were detected in the young fruits and the longest splice variant was downregulated after  <dig> dpa, in contrast to the constant expression of the annotated sun transcript. the shorter sun splice variant was resulted from altered transcription start site at the third intron, encoding a smaller protein, but expressed at low level .

we further conducted an enrichment analysis of go ontology on the two data sets containing the differentially expressed transcripts at gene and isoform levels, respectively. the analysis revealed that three functional categories—transporter activity , catalytic activity  and hydrolase activity —were overrepresented in both of the two data sets . however, go term of oxygen binding  was only enriched in the data set showing differential expression at gene level, whereas two categories of protein binding  and nucleotide binding  were overrepresented in that with differentially expressed splice variants. at gene level, genes involved in two biological processes of carbohydrate metabolic process  and transport  were overrepresented, but there were no enriched go terms of biological processes for these genes with differentially expressed splice variants.

novel transcription regions
by comparison of all the assembled transcripts identified in our rna-seq samples to the annotated tomato genes , we found a total of  <dig>  transcription regions and  <dig> of them were chromosomal regions not annotated previously. after assembling all transcripts from the  <dig> transcription regions, a total of  <dig> unique contigs with lengths from  <dig> to  <dig>  bp from  <dig> different chromosomal regions were assembled; these chromosomal regions were considered as new transcription regions . more than half of these unique transcript contigs contain multiple sequences of either splice variants or antisense transcripts. we then validated  <dig> ntrs by rt-pcr using total rna isolated from different tissues. transcription was detected for all the  <dig> ntr transcripts, and we further found that some transcripts showed differential expression during early fruit development .fig.  <dig> rt-pcr validation of forty-one ntrs. forty-one ntr transcripts were randomly selected for rt-pcr validation. sl, s.lycopersicum cv heinz1706; sp, s.pimpinellifolium la <dig>  nort, negative control using reaction mixture without reverse transcriptase added as templates. genomic, genomic dna of la <dig> as pcr templates. m, dna marker 2 k plus ii . information of the  <dig> ntrs can be found in additional file 4: table s <dig> and primer sequences used for rt-pcr were listed in additional file 8: table s5



in addition, three quarters of the  <dig> transcript contigs have nucleotides longer than 500 bp, indicating many of them are likely protein coding sequences. indeed, blast research against ncbi database revealed that there were  <dig> ntr transcripts sharing high similarity  with protein coding sequences from various plant species. in addition,  <dig> and  <dig> transcript contigs share high sequence similarity with microrna precursors and putative long non-coding rnas  annotated in ncbi database, respectively . the remaining  <dig> ntr transcript contigs share no significant similarity with protein encoding sequences, but  <dig> of them contain open reading frames longer than  <dig> amino acids. therefore, they are likely new protein coding genes . thus, in addition to the  <dig> putative lncrnas, there are likely  <dig> new protein coding genes in the tomato genome that have not been predicted.

discussion
recently developed high throughput sequencing technology has allowed effective genome-wide detection of as events in several plant species. in this study, we used strand-specific rna-seq to conduct a genome-wide analysis of as events in cultivated tomato and its direct ancestor s.pimpinellifolium and compared the as patterns between three characteristic stages of early growth fruits. we found that nearly 60 % of tomato multi-exon genes were alternatively spliced, a much higher frequency than the recently estimated  <dig>  %  <cit> . but the frequency is close to the highest ones discovered up to now in arabidopsis and soybean  <cit> . more as events discovered in our analysis is likely benefited from the longer reads we used because longer reads apparently retain more sequence information of the splice junctions. it is also known that the as frequencies discovered within the same plant species vary considerably among different experiments because of different tissue types and growth conditions as well as different prediction algorithms used. for example, in arabidopsis, the frequencies of multi-exon genes that underwent as range from  <dig> to 61 %  <cit> . since as is affected by tissue types, developmental stages and growth conditions, we would expect higher as frequencies to be detected in tomato when different tissues at various developmental stages and under different growth conditions are analyzed.

in tomato, early fruit growth contributes to the formation of fruit traits such as fruit morphology and sugar contents  <cit> . fruit growth beginning with successful fertilization of ovules has a short duration of cell division followed by a long concomitant cell expansion phase  <cit> . transcriptomic profiling has identified a number of differentially expressed genes during fruit set and early fruit growth . the identification of  <dig> genes differentially expressed in s.pimpinellifolium during very early fruit growth  further provides informative knowledge on gene regulation associated with early fruit growth, especially on cell division and cell expansion, which has not been targeted previously. our gene profiling analysis also revealed that there were a much higher number of genes differentially expressed between  <dig> and  <dig> dpa. the result is in agreement with the previous report that from  <dig> to  <dig> dpa, s.pimpinellifolium fruits mainly undergo cell division, whereas developmental program is shifted to cell expansion in  <dig> dpa fruits  <cit> . the expression patterns of genes involved in auxin, gibberellin and cytokinin pathways as well cell cycle regulation are also consistent with the cell division and differentiation in the fruits at the three time points.

furthermore, our analysis discovered a distinctive as pattern in early fruit growth, which more as events per gene were identified in the young fruits compared to other tissues, although the frequencies of as events in the fruits were close to those in seedlings and flowers. compared to the number of differentially expressed genes at gene level, more genes showed differential expression at isoform level. we found that  <dig> genes had at least one splice variants differentially expressed during early fruit growth, whereas only  <dig> of them were differentially expressed at gene level. this indicates that as plays an indispensible role in regulation of gene expression during early fruit growth. it is worthy to notice that although more genes were differentially expressed during the transition from cell division to cell expansion  at gene level, there were similar numbers of splice variants differentially expressed between cell division phase  and the cell division-expansion transition. we also identified  <dig> genes showing significant changes in as patterns during early fruit growth. it has been shown that the abundance and activity of splicing factors affect the as profiles of target genes  <cit> . among the  <dig> differential splicing genes, some are likely involved in regulation of transcription and protein stability, such as solyc01g <dig>  which encodes a 26s proteasome regulatory subunit. the upf <dig> homolog solyc10g <dig> regulating nonsense-mediated decay of ptc transcripts also showed differential alternative splicing in early fruit growth. this implicates that alternative splicing of some genes involved in maintaining transcript and protein stability is regulated by early fruit development.

high throughput rna-seq, which can produce millions of reads in a single experiment, has the potential to detect novel transcripts and provides an additional way to facilitate gene prediction. using rna-seq, a large number of ntrs unlinked to the annotated loci have discovered in rice  <cit> , soybean  <cit> , grape  <cit>  and arabidopsis  <cit> . in this study, we detected  <dig> new unique transcripts from  <dig> chromosomal regions where no gene has been predicted previously. consistent with the reported analysis conducted in grape  <cit> , transcripts from more than half of these ntrs are likely lncrnas, indicating that these putative lncrnas may play important roles in regulation of early fruit growth in tomato. furthermore, the remaining about  <dig> protein coding genes not predicted previously will be a valuable resource for genomic and genetic analysis of fruit growth in tomato. therefore, the newly identified ntrs in this study will also facilitate updating the tomato genome annotation in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we detected  <dig>  % of the expressed multi-exon genes in the tomato genome that underwent as and found that ir is the most abundant as type. comparison of as events in different tissues revealed that multi-exon genes produced more splice variants in early growth fruits than did in seedlings and flowers. we also discovered that for many genes, transcription was regulated at isoform level rather than at gene level during early fruit growth. in addition, the identification of the more than two thousands of ntrs in this study provides a rich resource for future genomic and genetic analysis in tomato.
