BACKGROUND
somatic embryogenesis , where a single or a group of somatic cells differentiate to form embryonic cells under suitable in vitro conditions  <cit>  is a good system to explore gene expression patterns associated with initial stages of embryo development. the formation of embryos from somatic cells closely resembles the developmental pathway of zygotic embryos  and hence, the molecular information generated for the se pathway could be used to explain the dynamic molecular interactions that take place during early embryogenesis  <cit> . recently, a broad analysis of se regulation in higher plants with an especial emphasis on associated developmental pathways, differential gene expression, and proteomics has been reviewed elsewhere  <cit> .

over the past few years, progress of molecular techniques have immensely contributed in understanding the molecular aspects of se in many plant species i.e. arabidopsis  <cit> , cotton  <cit> , alfalfa  <cit> , conifer  <cit> , potato  <cit> , glycine max  <cit> , oil palm  <cit> , maize  <cit> , picea glauca  <cit> , p. balfouriana  <cit> , vitis vinifera  <cit> , medicago truncatula  <cit>  and manihot esculenta  <cit> . although the draft molecular interaction network provided for se highlights the potential interactions at a molecular level  <cit> , the functional characterization of the majority of genes involved in somatic-to-embryogenic transition and subsequent embryo maturation still remain largely unknown.

the advent of high throughput genomic and transcriptomic approaches has created great interest in the development of networks for plant metabolic processes to study how genes or gene products are regulated spatially and temporally to achieve cellular demands. studies based on large scale transcriptome profiling have given a fundamental insight into the aspects of co-expressing genes and their roles in metabolic pathways. for instance, gene expression during the course of arabidopsis ze development, from zygote to mature embryos have been studied using microarray technology by xiang et al.  <cit> . recently, a global scale transcriptomic profiling of developing embryos using rna sequencing  has been reported for the monocot model plant, oryza sativa  <cit> . moreover, illumina rna-seq platform has been successfully used in a study related to developing seeds of maize  <cit> .

although, large scale genetic resources have been generated for arabidopsis ze development, a high resolution dataset for se is still not available. such a dataset is required to develop a system level model which will facilitate better understating of the molecular aspects of embryo development in vitro. therefore, the present study was designed to generate transcript datasets for early stage somatic embryos through high-throughput illumina hiseq  <dig>  these data may provide a solid framework for future studies to investigate molecular interactions in early se.

RESULTS
understanding the molecular mechanisms that drives plant embryogenesis is a major challenge due to limited accessibility to the developing embryos i.e. early stages of arabidopsis zes. given the advantage of high-throughput sequencing systems as well as the advanced knowledge of the ze development pathway, availability of a standard protocol to induce somatic embryos and accessibility to the well annotated genome information, directed us to select the model plant, arabidopsis, to study the global gene expression patterns in plant se through rna-seq. the transcriptome information given here would serve as a useful resource in future to develop a regulatory system for this dicot model species; this will pave the way for genetic improvement of se in other dicot species.

illumina sequencing and mapping sequence reads to the reference genome
transcriptome sequencing through rna-seq is a relatively straight forward approach that allows exploring gene expression profiles at a global scale. to provide a comprehensive overview of arabidopsis se at a transcriptional level, we sequenced cdna libraries constructed from three distinct in vitro embryo developmental time-points using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. this produced a total of  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads, encompassing  <dig>  mbases from all four cdna libraries, embryos after  <dig> d ,  <dig> d ,  <dig> d  of in vitro culture and wild type  leaf tissues . on average  <dig> % of the quality filter passed reads generated for all three somatic embryo samples were mapped uniquely to the reference genome. another  <dig> % of reads were mapped to multiple locations in the genome and the remaining reads were either unmapped  or did not show primary hits . of the mapped reads identified in both tissue types, on average approximately  <dig> % of reads were mapped to the exons,  <dig> % of reads were mapped to introns and the remaining  <dig> % of reads were aligned with the 10 kb upstream and downstream of the transcripts. a summary of mapping statistics obtained for each sample is given in table  <dig> table  <dig>

the average coverage profiles computed for the mapped reads using the integrative genomic viewer  tool for each chromosome showed that the read coverage of each chromosome is uniform across all samples examined. log transformed  coverage values were used to generate coverage plots as it gives a better visualization of read depths. only the chromosome  <dig> coverage map is shown here .figure  <dig> coverage plots generated for transcripts aligned to the chromosome  <dig>  se_5d, se_10d and se_15d are to represent embryogenic samples collected after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of in vitro culture, respectively. wt_l: wt leaf tissues.



conversion of mapped and assembled read counts into normalized digital transcript levels ) is a prerequisite for comparing expression profiles of genes within or between samples to provide a comprehensive overview of transcriptomes. for downstream gene expression analysis, expression measures of individual gene isoforms were combined to obtain the final transcript level for a particular gene. in this study we report the presence of transcripts for  <dig>  annotated genes in at least one of the three somatic embryo samples examined; this reflects approximately ≈ 80% of the annotated genes reported in the latest arabidopsis genome release . among these genes,  <dig>  of protein coding genes ,  <dig>   transposable elements ,  <dig>  pseudo genes and  <dig>  other rna genes were identified. the distribution of fpkm values for each sample analysed showed a similar pattern, skewing to the right .figure  <dig> distribution of transcript abundance in somatic embryo transcriptomes. this represents the transcriptome of embryogenic tissues collected after  <dig> d of in vitro culture.



in brief,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   annotated genes were transcriptionally active in se_5d, se_10d, se_15d and wt_l, respectively. the figure  <dig> summarizes the distribution of expressed genes found in each sample examined. based on our study, it was noted that a total of  <dig>  genes  are expressed only in embryogenic tissues but not in wt leaf tissues. this included  <dig> transcription factor  encoding genes over  <dig> tf families. myb , mads-box , c3h , basic helix-loop-helix  , c2h <dig> , homeobox  and apetala <dig> /ethylene responsive element binding proteins   were the main tf families observed.figure  <dig> venn diagram representing the transcribed genes detected in embryogenic and leaf tissues. se_5d, se_10d and se_15d are to represent embryogenic samples collected after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of in vitro culture, respectively. wt_l: wt leaf tissues.



furthermore, the gene ontology  enrichment analysis of this gene subset identified  <dig>  genes with annotated go terms. they were significantly enriched for  <dig> go terms over three main functional categories at p <  <dig> , biological processes  , molecular function   and cellular components  . the highly enriched go terms  found in each main functional category is shown in figure  <dig>  for instance, embryo sac development , megagametogenesis , gametophyte development , developmental process , tetrapyrrole binding , heme binding , iron ion binding , endomembrane system , cell part  and cell  were the main functional sub-groups that showed highest significance. to determine the biological pathways that are functionally more active, the specifically transcribed gene subset  found in somatic embryos was further analysed through the skypainter tool . this showed over-representation of  <dig> main biological pathways .figure  <dig> more highly enriched go terms found within the gene subset that showed a somatic embryo specific expression pattern. go:0009553: embryo sac development; go:0009561:megagametogenesis; go:0048229: gametophyte development; go:0032502: developmental process; go:0007275: multicellular organismal development; go:0048856: anatomical structure development; go:0032501: multicellular organismal process; go:0010224: response to uv-b; go:0008152: metabolic process; go:0006511: ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process; go:0043632: modification-dependent macromolecule catabolic process; go:0019941: modification-dependent protein catabolic process; go:0051603: proteolysis involved in cellular protein catabolic process; go:0048316: seed development; go:0044257: cellular protein catabolic process; go:0046906: tetrapyrrole binding; go:0020037: heme binding; go:0005506: iron ion binding; go:0019992: diacylglycerol binding; go:0043169: cation binding; go:0043167: ion binding; go:0008289: lipid binding; go:0046872: metal ion binding; go:0046914: transition metal ion binding; go:0030528: transcription regulator activity; go:0004842: ubiquitin-protein ligase activity; go:0019787: small conjugating protein ligase activity; go:0003700: transcription factor activity; go:0016881: acid-amino acid ligase activity; go:0012505: endomembrane system; go:0044464: cell part; go:0005623: cell.

in general, as compared to previous plant embryogenesis related studies, our study report abundant transcript information for downstream analysis. for example, an expression analysis based on microarray technique has demonstrated expression of at least  <dig>  genes across the three embryonic stages, globular, heart and torpedo in arabidopsis  <cit> . a similar expression analysis has shown expression of  <dig>  different transcripts in at least one of the stages or sub-regions of arabidopsis developing seeds  <cit> . therefore, the arabidopsis somatic embryo transcriptome information given here may serve as a valuable resource for future studies.

gene expression patterns across the three distinct in vitro embryo developmental time-points
to provide an overview of potential gene expression patterns that may exist during in vitro embryogenesis, transcript levels of  <dig>  annotated genes were compared between different embryo developmental time-points. of these,  <dig>  genes were co-expressed in all three developmental time-points;  <dig> were co-expressed between se_5d and se_10d;  <dig> were co-expressed between se_10d and se_15d;  <dig> were co-expressed between se_5d and se_15d. in addition,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes were preferentially expressed in se_5d, se_10d and se_15d, respectively. although a considerable fraction of co-expressed genes was identified between time-points, the most of the genes showed noticeable variations in transcript levels. thus, to determine differentially expressed genes , transcript levels  of genes were compared between the time-points. a total of  <dig>  degs were found between  <dig> and  <dig> d after in vitro culture with  <dig> up-regulated ] ≥  <dig> ) and  <dig> down-regulated  genes. it was found that  <dig>  tf encoding genes are differentially expressed between these two time-points and the majority were from tf families such as myb , bhlh  and mads  . additionally, several embryogenesis related genes such as late embryogenesis abundant  genes , nitrate transport  <dig>  , agamous-like  <dig> , maternal effect embryo arrest  <dig> , maternal effect embryo arrest  <dig> , ats3-like gene , embryo sac development arrest  <dig> , ats <dig>  and embryo sac development arrest  <dig>  were also detected among the degs.table  <dig>

a similar differential gene expression analysis between  <dig> and  <dig> d after in vitro cultures identified a total of  <dig>  up regulated genes and  <dig> down regulated genes. this comprised  <dig>  tf genes; the majority were members of tf families such as myb or myb related , mads-box  and ap2/erebp  . furthermore, lea genes such as at1g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at1g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at3g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at1g <dig> and at1g <dig> as well as several other embryogenesis related genes i.e. embryo sac development  <dig>  seed gene  <dig> , agl <dig>  responsive to abscisic acid  <dig>  were also differentially expressed between se_10d and se_15d.

visualization of functional networks generated based on enriched go terms related to bp for the identified degs between different somatic embryo developmental time-points exhibited the complexity of responses between the time-points. for example, genes expressed at a noticeably higher level in embryogenic tissues after  <dig> d as compared  <dig> d were mainly enriched for functional networks related to hormone transport , carbohydrate mediated signalling pathways and cell wall organization and biogenesis . in contrast, more highly expressed genes found in embryogenic cultures after  <dig> d were mainly enriched for functional networks related to energy metabolism and regulation of various responses to stimuli. a similar analysis of genes up regulated between embryogenic tissues after  <dig> and  <dig> d showed over-representation of biological networks such as cellular hormone biosynthesis and metabolic process , regulation of secondary metabolic process and regulation of reproductive process.figure  <dig> illustration of functional networks based on enriched go terms for bp for more highly expressed genes detected in embryogenic tissues after  <dig> d of in vitro culture as compared to  <dig> d. networks were built using high stringency . only highly significant networks are presented here. the leading group term is based on the highest significance. each node represents an enriched go term whereas edges denote the functional relationship between the bp. functionally related nodes are presented in the same colour.



in summary, a total of  <dig>  degs were detected in the process of in vitro embryo development;  <dig>  genes between se_5d and se_10d;  <dig>  genes between se_10d and se_15d;  <dig>  genes between se_5d and se_15d. the remaining genes showed relatively stable expression during this process. in order to determine the potential gene expression patterns that may exist throughout the course of embryo development, the fpkm read counts of these degs were obtained for each embryo developmental time-point and transformed into a log  scale. of these,  <dig> genes were excluded from the downstream cluster analysis as they were not expressed/detected  in at least one of the tissue sampling time-points. the remaining  <dig>  genes were grouped into  <dig> user defined clusters based on their expression patterns. based on the  <dig> clusters generated from the software, at least eight distinct gene expression patterns were detected . in accordance with previous research on rice embryo development  <cit> , the majority of genes  fell into the continuously down regulated gene cluster . these genes were highly enriched for go terms related to carbohydrate, lipid and amino acid metabolic processes. in addition, we found that expression levels of  <dig> genes gradually increase with embryo maturation . this gene subset was mainly enriched for stress responsive genes.figure  <dig> potential gene expression patterns during se. the x-axis represents somatic embryo developmental time-points,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d after in vitro culture.



the eight different expression patterns identified here were further analyzed to examine whether any of these clusters are enriched for a particular tf family. it was found that at least  <dig> tf genes covering ≈  <dig> different tf families are differentially expressed during se. figure 7a shows the distribution of tf related genes among the clusters. with the exception of clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  almost all the clusters consisted of approximately 6-7% of tf related genes. a relatively higher percentage of tf related genes was detected in cluster  <dig> and  <dig>  which was about 11% and 9%, respectively. moreover, among the differentially expressed tfs detected, the majority belong to the tf families such as bhlh , myb , ap2/erebp , mads-box , wrky  and homeobox domain proteins . the distribution of highly occurring tf families within each cluster is highlighted in figure 7b. the distribution percentage of each tf family was calculated in relation to each tf family size given in the arabidopsis gene regulatory information server . most of the genes related to ap2/epebp, homeobox, mads-box and bhlh families were found in clusters  <dig> and  <dig> where the gene expression was relatively high at the early and late stages, respectively.figure  <dig> distribution of tfs across the eight gene clusters. , percentage of tfs in each gene cluster; , distribution of tf family members across the clusters.



analysis of the remaining  <dig> genes that showed zero fpkm in at least one of the three embryo developmental time-points mainly fell into three groups: differential gene expression only between se_5d and se_ <dig> ; differential gene expression only between se_10d and se_15d ; differential gene expression between se_5d and se_15d . in summary, a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were manually grouped into each cluster. it was found that genes related to anatomical structure development processes and catalytic activity were mainly enriched within the cluster a genes whereas genes related to peptide biosynthetic processes and nucleic acid binding were predominately enriched within cluster b. the genes fell into cluster c were largely enriched for stress responses. additionally, these gene clusters were further analysed to examine whether any of these clusters are enriched for a particular family of tfs. although several genes related to mads-box, wrky, myb-related and homeobox was found within the clusters, none of the clusters showed enrichment for a particular type of tf family. this may be due to the presence of limited number of member genes within each cluster.

genes identified as being more highly expressed in embryogenic tissues than in leaf tissues
although, a considerable fraction of co-expressed genes was detected between somatic embryos and wt leaf tissues, the majority of those genes showed a greater variation in transcript levels. therefore, to identify more highly expressed genes in somatic embryos, transcriptomes of in vitro embryos and wt_l were compared and genes with log <dig> ratios ≥  <dig>  were considered as more highly expressed genes in embryos. based on this criterion, a total of  <dig>  highly expressed genes were identified in somatic embryos; including  <dig>  protein coding genes and  <dig> tes. of these,  <dig>  genes were identified with annotated go terms, enriching for  <dig> functional groups at p <  <dig> . go terms such as cellular process , structural constituent of ribosome  and organelle  were the dominant functional groups of bp, mf and cc, respectively. further analysis of this gene subset to detect over-represented biological pathways identified  <dig> pathways with a greater significance . for instance, genes involved in biological pathways such as cell cycle, dna replication, endoreplication and alternative cell cycles, cell cycle checkpoints, pyrimidine metabolism and hormone biosynthesis were relatively highly expressed in somatic embryos than in wt_l.table  <dig>

the gene expression resources deposited in public repositories such as atgenexpress , genevestigator  and arrayexpress  are useful to investigate expression patterns of gene/gene families in variety of context i.e. expression across different tissue types, under diverse environmental conditions. we used genevestigator expression datasets  to further validate the expression patterns of a subset of those genes expressed more highly in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues by rna-seq. the resulting heat map for the embryogenic and leaf tissues revealed that the majority of genes selected are transcribed at a higher level in embryonic samples than in leaf tissues .

additionally, to identify the genes that encode for essential and non-redundant function, the subset of genes that were expressed at a higher level in somatic embryos were probed with the embryo defective mutant gene list reported in the seedgenes database . this database provides information on  <dig> essential genes and  <dig> mutants. it was evident that  <dig>  of those genes are expressed at a higher level in our somatic embryogenic samples than in leaf samples . these genes represent approximately 2% of the more highly expressed gene list detected in somatic embryos. gene expression patterns based on microarray data  also confirmed that the majority of these genes were expressed in reproductive tissues rather than in vegetative tissues . on the other hand, our study detected  <dig>  genes that were expressed at a higher level in leaf tissues . analysis of this gene subset identified  <dig> genes were present in the list of  <dig> embryo defective genes in the seedgenes database. further investigation of transcript levels using genevestigator clearly showed that these  <dig> genes are expressed at a considerably higher level in leaf tissues than in embryogenic tissues .

establishment of in vitro embryogenic cultures requires activation of several specific gene subsets. of these, genes that regulate the cell cycle and dna replication play a key role in controlling active cell proliferation. in this study, comparative expression profile analysis of  <dig> core cell cycle genes  <cit>  in somatic embryos and wt_l revealed that at least  <dig> genes are transcriptionally more active during se with log <dig>  ≥  <dig>  . of these, five cyclin dependent kinases  , seven type-a cyclins , nine type-b cyclins  and four cyclin-d  were identified. additionally, several cdk-like  genes  and gene members of the e2f tfs that function in cyclin d/retinoblastoma/e2f pathway i.e. e2fa, e2fc and e2l <dig> also showed noticeable accumulation of transcripts in embryogenic tissues than in wt leaf tissues. several studies have reported involvement of key regulators of cell cycle during embryogenesis. for instance, expression analysis of a cdk in coconut se has shown a gradual decrease in expression of cncdka during the course of somatic embryo development  <cit> . moreover, over-expression of arabidopsis cdka; <dig> caused developmental defects in embryos and lead to embryo lethality when it is knocked out  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that cell cycle genes may closely interact with hormone and other developmental signalling pathways to regulate in vitro embryogenesis  <cit> . however, additional research is needed to support this conclusion. therefore, the expression patterns presented here may be useful to inform future research to investigate the molecular function of these genes during se.figure  <dig> transcript levels of core cell cycle related genes in embryogenic and leaf tissues. se_5d, se_10d and se_15d are to represent embryogenic samples collected after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of in vitro culture, respectively. wt_l: wt leaf tissues. ash coloured cells denote zero fpkm values . the degs detected between somatic embryo and leaf tissues are denoted by asterisks.



dna replication plays a central role in the life cycle of plants. mutations in key genes involved in this process have caused several embryo defective phenotypes in arabidopsis. for instance, mutations in the catalytic subunit of the dna polymerase epsilon complex have shown developmental defects during embryogenesis  <cit> . therefore, to identify transcriptionally more active dna replication related genes in embryogenic tissues, transcript levels of  <dig> genes related to dna replication machinery  <cit>  were filtered from embryonic and leaf transcriptomes, and compared. it was found that among these genes,  <dig> are transcriptionally more active in somatic embryos with log <dig>  ≥  <dig>  ;  <dig> of these genes were successfully mapped to the dna replication pathway provided by the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  . this is in accordance with the finding of masuda et al.  <cit> , who reported higher expression of arabidopsis pre-replication complex components  in reproductive tissues than in vegetative tissues. further analysis of transcript levels for  <dig> genes related to dna double strand break  repair mechanism identified  <dig> significantly expressed genes in somatic embryos  . this included several well-studied dsb repair genes such as gamma response  <dig> , ras associated with diabetes  <dig> , breast cancer susceptiblity  <dig> , meiotic recombination  <dig>  and ku <dig>  these finding collectively suggest the importance to dna replication and repair mechanism during se which involves active cell proliferation.figure  <dig> transcriptionally more active genes that were mapped to the kegg dna replication machinery pathway. the genes that were more highly expressed in somatic embryos are highlighted in red boxes.



several tf encoding genes  were also differentially expressed between two tissue types examined here. of these,  <dig> genes were expressed more highly  in all three somatic embryo samples than in leaf tissues. these genes belong to more than  <dig> different tf families including c2h <dig> , ap2-erebp , bhlh , myb , homeobox , wrky , bzip  and mads-box . several of these tf encoding genes that are important in se are listed in table  <dig>  the majority of stress responsive genes that are involved in ethylene responses have been classified in the tf family, ap2-erebp. in our study we noted that at least  <dig> genes related to the ap2-erebp family are more highly expressed in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues. among those genes, both ethylene responsive tfs, rap <dig>   and rap <dig>  l  were detected at a noticeably higher level in somatic embryos . these two specific tfs play an important role during stress signalling  <cit> . additionally, several genes encoding for cytokinin response factors  were also transcriptionally more active in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues i.e. crf <dig>  crf <dig>  crf <dig>  cfr <dig>  cfr <dig>  crf <dig> and crf <dig>  these ap2-domain containing tfs, together with type-b arabidopsis response regulators, are involved in regulation of embryo, cotyledon and leaf development  <cit> . significant expression of rap <dig> , rap <dig>  l and four crfs  in embryogenic cultures has been reported in a qrt-pcr expression analysis of tfs  <cit> .table  <dig>

studies so far have discovered several marker genes that regulate somatic-to-embryogenic cell fate in plants  <cit> . in order to further validate the expression levels of some of these genes, the transcript levels of  <dig> well-studied marker genes were filtered from our transcriptome data. as expected none of the marker genes selected is expressed at a high level in leaf tissues . it was evident that fusca  <dig> , aba insensitive  <dig> , somatic embryogenesis receptor kinase  <dig> , ats <dig> and the lea genes i.e. ecp <dig> and ecp <dig> are expressed at a higher level during early se, with a gradual reduction during subsequent embryo maturation. additionally, leafy cotyledon  <dig> , wuschel related homeobox  <dig>  and agamous-like  <dig>  genes also showed accumulation of more transcripts in early stages as compared to se_15d; however, the transcripts levels remained relatively stable during  <dig> and  <dig> d after in vitro embryogenesis. considerable expression of leafy cotyledon  <dig> , baby boom  and wuschel  genes was noted in embryos after  <dig> d of in vitro culture. interestingly, the two embryo specific genes, ats <dig> and ats <dig>  <cit>  showed a similar pattern of transcript accumulation during in vitro embryogenesis where the expression was markedly high in embryos after  <dig> d of in vitro culture and then reduced as they develop. in addition, transcripts of both genes were noticeably more abundant in somatic embryos than in wt leaf tissues. although it has been hypothesized that both of these embryo specific genes may function in maintaining subcellular embryogenic structures and establishing storage material within the cell  <cit> , experimental validation has not yet been reported. based on our transcript information, it is more likely that both ats <dig> and ats <dig> genes may have a regulatory role during early se.figure  <dig> transcript abundance for  <dig> somatic embryo marker genes in embryogenic and leaf tissues. se_5d, se_10d and se_15d are to represent embryogenic samples collected after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of in vitro culture, respectively. wt_l: wt leaf tissues. actin  <dig>  was used as the reference gene.



expression patterns of genes related to epigenetic modifications
se is a highly dynamic developmental process that involves active dedifferentiation of somatic cells, followed by the induction and maturation of embryos. the process of induction of in vitro embryos is mainly regulated by plant growth regulators and stress responses. apart from that, these factors may contribute to induce epigenetic modifications during se. therefore, to gain insight into the expression patterns of genes that regulate these epigenetic signatures, transcript levels of genes related to dna methylation/demethylation and histone acetylation/deacetylation were studied in-depth. this would provide clues about the level of methylation during in vitro embryogenesis.

cytosine dna methylation is one of the well-studied epigenetic modifications in higher plants and is involved in regulation of gene expression and silencing of tes  <cit> . in addition, it controls various processes such as embryogenesis and genomic imprinting  <cit> . this process involves incorporation of a methyl group to the 5′ position of the cytosine base by a group of enzymes called dna methyltransferases. although there was no considerable variation in transcript levels of genes related to dna methylation/demethylation during se, a marked difference was noticed for these genes between somatic embryo and wt_l transcriptomes . both methyltransferase  <dig>  and chromomethylase  <dig>  genes that play a key role in maintaining cytosine dna methylation during arabidopsis embryogenesis  <cit>  were transcriptionally more active in embryogenic tissues . in addition, domains rearranged methyltransferase  <dig> , the main de novo methyltransferase found in arabidopsis  <cit>  also showed accumulation of more transcripts in somatic embryos. the single gene mutants of met <dig>  in arabidopsis display developmental defects in zes i.e. abnormal cell divisions during early embryogenesis and delayed development as compared to wt embryos  <cit> . in addition, the reduced expression levels observed for genes that specify cell fate during early embryogenesis , wox <dig> and yoda ) in met1- <dig> mutants highlights the importance of dna methylation in maintaining cell identify during early embryogenesis  <cit> . likewise, the double mutants of met <dig> and cmt <dig> genes have reduced seed viability. although further evidence is required, it is believed that dna methylation may be directly or indirectly involved in the regulation of polar auxin transport during early embryogenesis  <cit> . thus, it is possible that the increased expression levels observed for most of the genes related to cytosine dna methylation in somatic embryos may link to hormone and developmental signalling pathways that take place during in vitro embryogenesis.figure  <dig> transcript levels of genes related dna methylation/demethylation in embryogenic and leaf tissues. se_5d, se_10d and se_15d are to represent embryogenic samples collected after  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> d of in vitro culture, respectively. wt_l: wt leaf tissues. ash coloured cells denote zero fpkm values . the degs detected between somatic embryo and leaf tissues are denoted by asterisks.



similar to dna methylation related genes, the histone methylation related gene, krytonite  also showed higher expression in somatic embryos . this histone methyltransferase, kyp functions together with cmt <dig> to induce and maintain chg trinucleotide methylation in tes  <cit> . increased accumulation of both cmt <dig> and kyp transcripts in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues  suggests activation of cmt <dig> – kyp mediated cytosine methylation during se to inactivate mobile transposons.

furthermore, the proteins that bind to methylated cytosine also play a key crucial role in maintaining epigenetic status. of these, three variant in methylation  proteins have been identified as predominant regulators that maintain global cg dinucleotide methylation patterns and gene silencing in arabidopsis  <cit> . expression analysis of vim encoding genes through rt-pcr reports higher transcript levels for vim <dig> and vim <dig> in arabidopsis inflorescences than in leaves. moreover, a relatively similar level of gene expression has been detected in both inflorescences and leaves for vim <dig>  however, we found that all three vim encoding genes are expressed at a considerably higher level in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues . of these, vim <dig> showed the highest transcript abundance in embryogenic tissues; this suggests vims may play a role in maintaining methylation patterns during embryogenesis in vitro.

in addition to dna methylation, dna demethylation is also equally important in regulation of gene expression patterns during developmental processes. in arabidopsis, three genes related to the dme family , demeter-like  <dig>  and demeter-like  <dig> ) and a homolog of dme known as repressor of silencing  <dig> , that contain a dna glycosylase domain, are involved in dna demethylation  <cit> . it was evident that with the exception of dml <dig>  other genes related to dna demethylation were expressed at a relatively similar level in somatic embryos and wt leaf tissues. however, dml <dig> that catalyses active removal of 5-methylcytosine showed considerably lower expression in somatic embryos as compared to wt_l with an average log <dig> ratio of − <dig>  it is reported that although dml <dig> is expressed in siliques and leaves, it is not expressed in mature seeds. in addition, the mrna stability of dml <dig> may depend on the plant tissue type  <cit> . thus, based on our expression data, it can be assumed that dml <dig> transcripts are more stable in leaves as compared to embryos.

histone acetylation/deacetylation is another important post translational histone modification that regulates gene expression patterns during plant development as well as in response to various environmental conditions  <cit> . in general, hyperacetylation activates transcription and mediated by a group of enzymes known as histone acetyltransferases . the present study found that with the exception of the cbp family member hac <dig>  other hats are expressed stably during se. the hac <dig> gene was expressed at a considerably higher level in later stages  as compared to se_5d. in addition, the differential gene expression analysis of hats between embryogenic and leaf tissues showed noticeable accumulation of hac <dig> transcript in somatic embryos than in wt_l. however, to date no histone acetylation activity has been reported for this gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . in animals, cbp family proteins are considered as active transcriptional co-activators that regulate processes such as cell cycle and cell differentiation. moreover, cbp family members have been identified as essential regulators of mouse embryogenesis and pattern formation  <cit> . therefore, detection of increased expression of hac <dig> gene in somatic embryos suggests that it is likely to function during se, which also involves active cell divisions. in addition to hac <dig>  two genes from the gnat family, hag <dig> and hag <dig> also showed accumulation of more transcripts in somatic embryos than in leaf tissues with an average log <dig>  of  <dig> . however, the majority of plant hats have been identified by sequence characterization to other eukaryotes; thus, the functional characterization of the majority of these genes remains largely unknown. some of the functionally characterized hats include hag <dig>  haf <dig>  hac <dig>  hac <dig> and hac <dig>  <cit> . for instance, a study on plant hac <dig> has shown its function in reproductive and vegetative development in arabidopsis  <cit> ; t-dna mutants of hac <dig> have shown reduced fertility with shorter siliques as compared to wt plants and late flowering phenotypes  <cit> . therefore, it is possible that hag <dig>  hag <dig> and hac <dig> may also have a function in embryogenesis.

on the other hand, histone deacetylation/hypoacetylation may lead to a transcriptional repression. this process is catalysed by histone deacetylases   <cit> . expression profile analysis of  <dig> hdacs comprising  <dig> from the rpd <dig> family, four from the plant specific hd-tuins family and two from the sirtuin hdac family showed that with the exception of hda <dig>  all the hdacs are expressed throughout the se in a relatively stable manner. transcripts for the hda <dig> gene were only detected in se_10d. interestingly, it was noted that all four hd-tuins family members expressed at a relatively similar level in somatic embryos and shared a similar expression pattern during in vitro embryo development. a similar pattern of gene expression has been observed for hd-tuins family members in somatic embryos and seed derived embryos through in situ hybridization, indicating a functional redundancy of those genes in plant development  <cit> . additionally, these genes were transcriptionally more active in embryogenic tissues than in leaf tissues. similarly, zhou et al.  <cit>  report accumulation of hdt <dig>  hdt <dig> and hdt <dig> transcripts in somatic embryos derived from transgenic arabidopsis lines that over express bbm gene. however, it was not clear, whether the accumulation of hd-tuins type genes is due to formation of somatic embryos or over-expression of bbm in transgenic lines that exhibit a higher frequency of induced embryos  <cit> . the expression information in the present study provides strong support for the suggestion that hd-tuins family hdacs are important in arabidopsis se and are more likely to regulate histone modifications in target genes to maintain a high methylation status during se. however, additional information is needed to determine whether the increased transcript levels observed for hd-tuins in somatic embryos has a link to hormone or developmental signalling pathways that take place during embryogenesis.

in general, detection of increased transcript levels for key genes involved in dna methylation and histone deacetylation provides an indirect indication of increased epigenetic modifications during in vitro embryogenesis. however, it is not clear whether the expression changes we observed are due to in vitro conditions  or increased epigenetic signatures. therefore, it would be valuable to conduct a global analysis of the epigenome architecture of somatic embryos in order to understand the expression patterns of diverse embryogenesis related genes.

in silico expression analysis to identify genes more likely to be involved in se
identification of genes more likely to be involved in somatic embryo development would help in the discovery of novel molecular markers for future embryogenesis studies. as a preliminary study, to obtain an estimate of the overlap between genes expressed in somatic embryos and actively dividing callus,  <dig> genes were randomly selected from our list of genes that showed a higher level of expression in somatic embryos than in non-dividing leaf tissues ). it was considered likely that the majority of genes highly expressed in somatic embryos could also be expressed at a higher level in actively dividing cells, for example in callus. in order to address this possibility a comparison of expression data from somatic embryos, callus and leaf was conducted. this concluded that approximately 5% of genes are expressed at a higher level in somatic embryos than in actively dividing callus or non-dividing leaf tissues  ; experiment id: at-00508), callus ; experiment id: at-00265) and leaf tissues ; experiment id: at-00265). these data were filtered for the randomly selected gene list ).

in summary, comparison of microarray gene expression data for somatic embryos  and callus  tissues identified a minimum set of  <dig> genes that are more highly expressed in somatic embryos than in actively dividing callus cells. furthermore, subsequent hierarchical clustering of expression data for these  <dig> genes in samples: somatic embryos , callus , leaf  and torpedo stage zygotic embryos ; experiment id: at-00629) exhibited a distinct cluster with  <dig> genes  having a comparatively higher level of expression in somatic embryos than in torpedo stage zygotic embryos . furthermore, expression analysis of these genes in other anatomical parts using the genevestigator tool showed the majority of these genes have a distinct pattern of expression in somatic embryos as compared to other anatomical parts compared . therefore, these genes could be considered as potential candidate genes for future in vitro embryogenesis related studies.figure  <dig> hierarchical clustering  for a list of  <dig> genes expressed at a higher level in somatic embryos  than in callus , torpedo stage zygotic embryos  or leaf tissues .  hierarchical clustering of  <dig> genes;  expansion of the clade that showed a higher level of expression in somatic embryos than in callus, torpedo stage embryos or leaf tissues. green, purple, blue and orange lines represent expression data for torpedo stage zygotic embryos, leaf tissues, callus and somatic embryos, respectively. the genevestigator hierarchical clustering tool was used to construct the clustering tree.



interestingly, this subset of  <dig> genes included several genes responsible for oxidative stress such as at1g <dig>  at2g <dig>  at5g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at5g44380; genes responsible for salt stress, at4g <dig> and at4g27400; genes encoding for lea proteins, at3g <dig>  at4g <dig>  at5g <dig> and at5g60530; genes involved in auxin biosynthesis, at4g <dig> and at5g <dig>  moreover, further analysis of these genes revealed the four genes encoding for lea proteins are positively co-expressed  with both the auxin biosynthesis genes, at4g <dig> and at5g <dig> . although these genes were expressed at a higher level in somatic embryos than in other tissues, further studies are recommended to speculate whether these genes are differentially expressed during se or in response to exogenously supplied auxin,  <dig>  4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study provides a high resolution transcriptome dataset for arabidopsis se. a comparative analysis of expression profiles between different somatic embryo developmental time-points as well as between embryogenic and leaf tissues provided subsets of degs. functional characterization of those gene subsets based on significantly enriched go terms and over-represented biological pathways is presented here. however, further functional characterization and validation of these genes at a molecular level is recommended. interestingly, the comparison of somatic embryo and leaf tissue derived transcriptomes revealed distinct expression profiles for the majority of genes involved in cell cycle, dna replication and repair mechanism, dna cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation. the latter results suggest a particular role for epigenetic regulation in the se process, and may provide useful leads in the design of systems for the improved induction of embryonic cells from somatic tissue. interestingly, in silico expression analysis of genes using publicly available microarray expression data identified a subset of  <dig> genes that are more likely to be involved in se, and could be considered as potential candidate genes for future embryogenesis studies in vitro. in conclusion, the transcriptomic data generated in the present study for arabidopsis somatic embryos provides insights into future functional studies and into the development of gene regulatory networks for model species, as a means of understanding the molecular mechanisms that control se.
