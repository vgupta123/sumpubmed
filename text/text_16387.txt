BACKGROUND
physarum polycephalum, commonly known as "slime mold", belongs to the mycetozoan group of amoebozoa. physarum follows a complex life cycle with haploid and diploid cell types, formed in temporal order as triggered by environmental stimuli  <cit> . the plasmodium is a multinucleate single cell whose nuclei display natural synchrony with respect to cell cycle and differentiation status. during several days of starvation, a plasmodium grown to macroscopic size becomes competent to sporulate. sporulation can then be triggered experimentally by exposing a competent plasmodium to a pulse of blue or far-red light, or to heat shock. as plasmodial nuclei are synchronous, and because the timing of the differentiation program in individual plasmodia can be reproduced experimentally, the stage-specific gene expression program that leads to sporulation can be analyzed at high resolution  <cit> . recent large scale cdna surveys  <cit>  provide a basis for studying the phenomenon at the transcriptomic level.

in order to identify the differentially expressed genes associated with the commitment to sporulation, we characterized and compared two cdna libraries prepared from competent and light-induced plasmodia using massive parallel sequencing technology  <cit> . we employed this method because it does not rely on reference transcripts for quantitation, previous cloning steps are not required, it does not have an upper limit for quantitation, and it is a relatively unbiased approach  <cit> . from the comparison of annotations and transcript quantitations, we found that most differentially expressed genes encode proteins associated to a network of actin-binding proteins. components of this putative interaction network are associated to development, dna repair, cell division, calcium release, cell death, and maintenance of cell integrity.

RESULTS
sequencing and profiling of cdnas expressed in competent and light-induced plasmodia
separate cdna libraries were constructed from polya+ rna isolated from two sources:  competent plasmodia; and  sporulation- induced plasmodia . the cdnas libraries were then analyzed using massive parallel sequencing  <cit> . transcripts were annotated at every bioinformatic level, and the annotation data was used to infer hypothetical interaction networks from differentially regulated genes. the whole approach is summarized in the .

from the pyrosequencing, we obtained a total output of  <dig>  mb from two runs, corresponding to the starved  and light-induced  plasmodia libraries. considering that physarum possess a  <dig> mb genome, and assuming that 10% is encoding genes, we estimate a  <dig> Ã— coverage of protein coding sequences. the assembled sequencing output consisted of  <dig>  sequences, and large cdnas from this assembly  were then joined to a previously available sequence dataset  <cit> , to form a comprehensive set of representative transcripts. this analysis produced  <dig>  sequences,  <dig>  of these containing transcript abundance data:  <dig>  reads from competent and  <dig>  reads from light-induced plasmodia, respectively . we used this abundance data  as a measure of expression, which we defined as "hit counts". the remaining contigs without hit counts consisted of previously sequenced clones from a normalized cdna library prepared from competent plasmodia  <cit> , indicating that the normalization produced a broader coverage of transcripts. from  <dig>  cdna contigs detected in the competent plasmodia library , over  <dig>  were represented with at least five hits . conversely,  <dig>  transcripts  were found with  <dig> or less sequence hits in both samples. for statistical reasons, no statement on the differential expression from this fraction could be made. between contigs with lowest hit counts,  <dig>  cdna species were represented by just one hit , and  <dig>  from light-induced sample .

we compared the transcript hit counts between different libraries as a measure of differential gene expression. as most contig species were represented by low hit counts, we normalized the number of hits. to this end, we first obtained the relative frequency , and later we calculated the relative frequencies for each contig in the two cdna samples compared to each other. given that each est belongs to a single gene, the significance of its differential expression depends only on the number of hits, respect to the total number of hits on each library  <cit> . following these assumptions, we found  <dig>  cdnas that displayed significant differential expression . all contig species, regardless of whether differentially expressed or not were submitted to the sequence read archive subset of genbank  <cit>  .

the newly assembled contigs were compared against sequence databases using blastx  <cit> . this analysis revealed that  <dig>  sequences have significant similarity  to existing sequences in swissprot  <cit> ,  <dig>  to the protozoa subset from refseq  <cit> , and  <dig>  to proteins of the related model organism dictyostelium discoideum . from the  <dig>  sequences with hit counts data, orthologs were identified for  <dig>  transcripts .

later, in order to identify differentially regulated genes, we clustered the contig species into expression groups according to their relative frequencies in both conditions. as a result, we found contigs encoding orthologs related to cell division  and protein synthesis and degradation  with higher relative frequencies in the competent plasmodial library. similarly, we found orthologs related to the cytoskeleton  and cell differentiation genes  with greater relative frequencies in the light- induction library .

gene ontology annotation of the transcriptome
the gene ontology  project  <cit>  is an annotation framework that provides a standardized vocabulary that is used to assign function to uncharacterized sequences, based on three main categories: biological processes , molecular functions  and cellular components . we employed blast2go  <cit> , a tool that associates go terms to sequences based in several annotation evidences, to classify gene function in our dataset. using the blastx hits , together with go terms previously extracted from interpro domain searches  <cit> , we inferred  <dig>  go annotations for  <dig>   cdnas, with  <dig>  annotations belonging to  <dig>  sequences with hit counts data. transcripts were associated to biological processes , molecular functions , and cellular components . as many as  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   sequences were annotated with a combination of mf and bp terms, mf and cc, and bp and cc terms respectively, and  <dig>  cdnas were annotated with mf, bp and cc terms altogether. later, in order to analyze the differences between the two condition groups with respect to the go annotations, we carried out fisher exact tests using the gossip module  <cit>  from blast2go. we found that the 'cell development' , 'cell death'  and 'death'  go terms were overrepresented in cdnas with higher relative frequencies in light-induced plasmodia , as compared to competent plasmodia .

pathway classification of transcripts
functional annotation can also be classified using the pathway-based definition of ortholog genes from the kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> . in order to categorize the transcripts in kegg pathways, we employed the kaas server  <cit> , a tool that uses similarity information to assign a sequence to a kegg ortholog  identifier, with default parameters for ests. we mapped  <dig>   transcripts to  <dig> reference metabolic pathways,  <dig>  including hit counts data, from which  <dig> correspond to cdnas with higher relative frequencies in the library prepared from competent plasmodia, and  <dig> cdnas in the library prepared from light-induced plasmodia respectively. in addition,  <dig> sequences in total were assigned to the kegg brite hierarchies. transcripts associated to the nucleotide metabolism  and citrate cycle  had the highest representation for the reference metabolic pathways, and the wnt, tgf-beta and jak- stat signaling pathways were also depicted for the whole dataset . in the whole dataset we identified  <dig> cdnas with potential roles in cell differentiation, with molecular entities associated to kinases  and gtp binding  having the highest representation in the brite hierarchies. in addition, we mapped  <dig>  total enzyme commission  numbers  with  <dig> unique enzyme names in  <dig> transcripts, using the ec-module of blast2go  <cit> . later, in order to assess the global metabolic changes that occur after light induction, transcripts with ko identifiers were mapped using the kegg atlas tool  <cit> . for transcripts with higher relative frequencies in the competent plasmodia library, we mapped enzymes for the lipid biosynthesis  and oxidative phosphorylation  pathways. conversely, we identified enzymes for the n-glycan biosynthesis , urea cycle  and fatty acid metabolism  pathways in transcripts with higher relative frequencies in the light-induced plasmodial library . in the end, we obtained  <dig>  contigs annotated for go terms, kegg orthologs, and interpro hits together . a summary of sequencing annotations and statistics is listed on the table  <dig> 

a contigs with relative frequencies higher in the competent plasmodial library , are classified as downregulated. relative frequencies correspond to the number of hits per transcript divided by the total number of hits for each condition, competent  and light-induced  plasmodial libraries. b upregulated transcripts: those with relative frequencies higher in the light-induced plasmodial library 

inference of interaction networks
in order to identify the functional relationships between the annotated cdnas, we searched for known interactions in the literature. first, we used the cdnas that were previously clustered according to their relative frequencies , and included additional proteins whose interactions have been observed in the literature for physarum. using the "guilt by association" heuristic to link coexpressed transcripts into functional groups  <cit> , we inferred an interaction network between those transcripts. this network is primarily based on actin-binding activities .

later, to identify genes with similar regulation, we listed those transcripts with highest rates of relative frequencies, counted in both cdna libraries . as most of these highly differentially regulated transcripts did not show any sequence similarity to previously annotated genes, we clustered the subset of cdnas with similarity to annotated genes according to two parameters:  their rate of relative frequencies; and  their statistical significance of differential expression  <cit> . in this way we listed those  <dig> transcripts with annotations that were most up- or most downregulated in light-induced plasmodia, based on the statistical significance of their differential expression . despite the apparent diversity in biochemical functions, we searched for known interactions between these two groups of transcripts.

transcripts with unambiguous annotations, significant differential expression , and that possess the highest levels of downregulation , are listed. blast2go  <cit>  automatic annotations were used, and manual corrections of annotations were included in some cases.

a list of transcripts with unambiguous annotations, significant differential expression  with the highest levels of upregulation , is shown. annotations, swissprot accessions, hit counts, and probability values follow the same convention as in table  <dig> 

from annotations of the top up- and down-regulated transcripts , and including the transcripts from the above mentioned analysis , we extended the initial putative network using cytoprophet  <cit> . this cytoscape  <cit>  plugin predicts networks based on information from interaction databases, associated to swissprot matches of newly annotated genes  <cit> . accordingly, we found that most of these genes encoded proteins predicted to interact in a network of actin-binding proteins . these genes encoding proteins orthologs of which are associated to cell division , dna repair , signal transduction , and calcium-binding  are downregulated in light-induced plasmodia . in turn, a different group of developmentally regulated genes is preferentially expressed after photoinduction, including genes the products of which are involved in signaling , protein processing , cell integrity , calcium-binding , and developmentally regulated actin-binding, such as the elongation factor 1Î± , spire, and actophorin .

discussion
the development of plasmodia competent for sporulation includes growth arrest, condensation of cellular constituents, and mitosis  <cit> . sporulation of competent plasmodia can be triggered by a light pulse. some proteins associated with the light-induced pathways that lead to sporulation have been described  <cit> , suggesting that several signaling mechanisms are involved, but there are no studies that describe changes at the level of the whole transcriptome. in the present study we identified the most up- and downregulated transcripts, which are associated to a network of putative interactions . the network is hypothetical as interactions used for inference are based on data obtained from different organisms. for the sake of simplicity, the discussion will be focused on genes with predicted significant interactions .

a network of actin-binding proteins is associated to changes during light-induced sporulation in physarum
the actin cytoskeleton of physarum is essential for locomotion, division, and other biological processes  <cit> . assembly and disassembly of actin filaments is controlled by a group of actin-binding proteins, whose activities in turn are regulated by specific signaling pathways. physarum cell types differ in actin organization but express the same actin genes, suggesting that changes in actin-binding proteins are responsible for the differences in actin organization  <cit> . physarum possesses several classes of actin- binding proteins, and most of these proteins display cell type-specific patterns of expression, but their precise roles are not known  <cit> . nevertheless, expression changes in genes coding for actin-binding proteins correlate with modifications in cell organization and behavior  <cit> . in the present study, we found that some actin-binding genes were linked specifically to stages before and after photoinduction in the starved physarum plasmodium.

specifically, we identified protist orthologs for actin-binding proteins, including dictyostelium coaa  and abp- <dig> , and actobindin from acanthamoeba, which binds actin monomers   <cit> . coactosin a interferes with the capping of f-actin filaments  <cit> , and is differentially expressed after metal exposure in worms  <cit> . abp- <dig> organizes filamentous actin into networks of fibers, and dictyostelium cells lacking abp- <dig> have a severe phototaxis defect at the multicellular slug stage  <cit> . in addition, we noticed that transcripts coding for physarum plasmodia-specific actin-binding proteins, such as profilin p   <cit>  and fragmin p   <cit> , are downregulated after photoinduction . frgp enables actin phosphorylation by the actin-fragmin kinase , and binds phosphorylated actin  <cit> . therefore it is possible that during sporulation these proteins are involved in the reorganization of the subcellular compartments via interactions with the actin cytoskeleton.

transcripts linked to cell division and dna repair are downregulated in the light-induced plasmodium
after several days of starvation, cell processes must be limited in order to save energy. coordination of several biological processes is then required, and thus regulation of these phenomena needs a pleiotropic transducer like the camp, which targets several signaling pathways, including those that limit cell proliferation  <cit> . cell differentiation pathways regulated by camp levels have been described in dictyostelium, a closely related protist  <cit> . for physarum, we found that mei <dig>  a transcript controlled via camp levels, is downregulated in the light-induced plasmodium . mei <dig> is an rna-binding protein that encodes a camp-regulated positive regulator of meiosis in the yeast s.pombe  <cit> . this gene product is functionally related to the actin cytoskeleton via the camp-dependent protein kinase a   <cit> . other transcripts downregulated in light-induced plasmodia associated to cell division and dna repair comprised fen <dig>  cdc <dig> and pum <dig>  first, the flap endonuclease  <dig>  appears in several processes linked to the maintenance of the genome integrity, such as the uv-induced dna repair  <cit> , as well as in dna replication and dna recombination  <cit> . second, the yeast cell division control protein  <dig> , constitutes the catalytic subunit of the spg1p gtpase-activating protein, that is involved in the signal transduction controlling septum formation. cdc <dig> is involved in cytokinesis  <cit>  and is essential for proliferation, as spores lacking a functional cdc <dig> gene complete mitosis without undergoing cell cleavage  <cit> . finally, pum <dig>  encodes a rna-binding protein associated to the control of meiosis during development  <cit> . consequently, starvation seems to be the signal that regulates cell division while protecting the cells from oxidative stress, through camp-regulated pathways .

other downregulated transcripts in the light-induced plasmodium comprised orthologs of transducers, such as fbl <dig>  a leucine-repeat protein linked to phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitination  <cit> , parp <dig>  an oryza poly adp-ribose polymerase, a phospholipase d from phytophtora , and the arabidopsis phosphatase 2c . in plants, g-proteins are involved in phospholipase d activation, and this also seems to be the case for phytophtora  <cit> ; on the other hand, pp2c operates in several signaling pathways that regulate stem cell differentiation  <cit> . it is then reasonable to consider that the differential expression of these transducers is also associated with the control of signaling mechanisms for differentiation, but more profound studies are needed to establish precise causal relationships.

calcium- binding proteins exhibit diverse regulation patterns in the light-induced plasmodium
transcripts identified as calcium-binding proteins displayed different patterns of expression regulation. these were either down-  or upregulated  after light induction. lav1- <dig> is a plasmodium-specific rna of unknown function that encodes a protein containing an ef-hand type domain whose calcium-binding activity has been observed in vitro in physarum  <cit> . lav1- <dig> seems to act as a sensor of cell damage, releasing ca2+ that leads to the activation of a plasmodium-specific transglutaminase, which separates damaged areas of a plasmodium  <cit> . other transcripts encoding orthologs of calcium-binding proteins, such as kcnip <dig> and gad, were also downregulated in the photoinduced plasmodium and have not been previously described for in physarum. kcnip <dig> encodes a potassium channel-interacting protein that probably modulates channels density in a ca2+- dependent manner. in turn, the activation of glutamate decarboxylase  by calcium-bound calmodulin  is required for normal growth in plants  <cit> . previous studies have shown that the intracellular increase of calcium levels is correlated with increased concentrations of camp and with sporulation and differentiation in both physarum and dictyostelium  <cit> . moreover, actin filament crosslinking is affected by changes in intracellular calcium levels, which ultimately influences the cell contractility  <cit> . therefore it seems possible that these calcium-binding proteins coordinate the ca2+ release as a means to influence the cell contractility through the interaction with the actin cytoskeleton .

furthermore, the upregulated subset of calcium-binding proteins included mlr <dig>  which inhibits cytokinesis in yeasts; trychohyalin , which is involved in its own calcium-dependent processing during differentiation; and the dictyostelium pat <dig> atpase. pat <dig> is localized in the membrane of contractile vacuoles, and is a component of a calcium sequestration and excretion pathway, which functions to help maintain homeostasis, especially under conditions of ca2+ stress  <cit> . thus these are candidates to control the intracellular calcium levels after light induction of starved plasmodia.

actin-binding proteins associated to development are overexpressed in the light-induced plasmodium
after photoinduction, a group of actin-binding proteins is upregulated including the elongation factor 1Î± , spire, and actophorin . spire is a drosophila gene involved in development through actin assembly. this gene is also widely distributed across the metazoan genomes. spire mammalian isoforms are map kinase substrates, and data suggest that spire evolved as an alternative independent mechanism of actin polymerization, necessary for cell polarization in multicellular organisms  <cit> . actophorin, in turn, binds actin monomers and separates actin filaments in a dose-dependent manner. phosphorylation of actophorin blocks actin binding  <cit> . in turn, ef1a, aside from its role in the protein synthesis, has a separate conserved actin-binding activity in eukaryota, initially observed in dictyostelium  <cit> , where it is predominantly found in actin-bound form  <cit> . ef1a regulates the stoichiometry of cytoskeletal components, and the conservation of the ef1a-actin interaction across eukaryotes suggests its importance for cytoskeletal maintenance  <cit> . overexpression of ef1a in yeast results in effects on cell growth, and influences the actin distribution, morphology and budding in a dosage-dependent manner, although this increase of ef1a has no effect over the protein synthesis  <cit> . in addition, changes in cytoskeletal redistribution of ef1a seem to be linked to the differentiation status, where the association between ef1a and microtubules gradually increases in differentiating cultures  <cit> . furthermore, ef1a stimulates actin remodeling and induces the formation of filopodia  <cit> , and possibly connects these processes with signaling pathways  <cit> .

we noticed that two coexpressed transcripts  are related to ef1a. first, cysteine proteinases are believed to participate in protein cleavage during the differentiation of dictyostelium as a response to starvation  <cit> , and these peptidases were copurified with ef1a in yeasts  <cit> . cuda, on the other hand, is associated to the transition from slug migration to culmination in dictyostelium. cuda expression levels depend on local camp concentration  <cit> . recent evidences show that cuda contains a novel dna-binding site that is distantly related to the metazoan stat domains, which participate in the regulation of developmentally controlled genes  <cit> , and whose orthologs coexpress with ef1a  <cit> . yamada et al.  <cit>  also proved a relationship between dictyostelium cuda and a cdna from physarum, which corresponds to the contig reported here as a cuda ortholog. for these reasons, ef1a could work as a link between regulation of the protein synthesis, cytoskeletal maintenance, and signal transduction in slime molds .

other developmentally regulated transcripts associated to the actin cytoskeleton included the cell wall integrity and stress response component , which is a yeast membrane protein that acts as a sensor of cell wall damage  <cit> , and cdc <dig>  a constituent of the nuclear pore complex that is also involved in the maintenance of cell morphology . wsc <dig> is essential to keep the cell integrity, behaving like a stress-specific signal transducer that is involved in the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton in response to osmotic shock  <cit> . wsc <dig> is involved in the depolarization of the actin cytoskeleton  <cit> , and, like cdc <dig> , is entailed in cytokinesis  <cit> .

gtp signaling genes involved in different processes are upregulated in the light-induced plasmodium
orthologs of certain genes highly upregulated in light-induced plasmodia are involved in signal transduction. these include transcripts linked to the gtp signaling , kinases  and phosphatases . the serine/threonine-kinase paka is a regulator of the myosin component of the cytoskeleton, required for cytokinesis and the regulation of the cytoskeleton during chemotaxis in dictyostelium  <cit> . in turn, the yeast dosage-dependent cell cycle regulator  <dig> , is a phosphatase whose increased dosage alters cell cycle progression, while its loss delays the progression in the g <dig> phase  <cit> . in addition, upregulated gtp signaling transducers included a putative gtpase- activating protein from arabidopsis ; a chlamydomonas gtp-binding protein ; and rgs <dig>  which acts as a negative regulator of g-protein signaling, a function that is evolutionarily conserved in yeast, c. elegans and mammals. increased rgs <dig> expression is primarily mediated by the camp/pka pathway  <cit> , therefore it is possible that rgs <dig> is carrying out similar tasks in slime molds, where it could work in coordination with the other transducers, as hypothesized in figure  <dig> 

transcripts annotated for cell death are overrepresented in the light-induced plasmodium
comparison of go terms between up- and downregulated groups showed that transcripts annotated for 'cell development' , 'cell death'  and 'death'  were overrepresented in the upregulated group . however, all these ontologies belong to the same hierarchy, meaning that 'cell death' can be the product of either development or organismal death, and hence 'cell death' is the only difference between both expression groups. one of these cdnas annotated for 'cell death' is sequestosome  <dig>  which is also included on the list of upregulated transcripts . sequestosome  <dig>  also known as p <dig>  is a multifunctional protein that targets polyubiquitinated proteins to degradation by proteasomes and autophagy  <cit> . p <dig> knockouts significantly increased cell death  <cit> , and this is probably linked to the interaction with atypical protein kinase c isoforms that are involved in pathways that control differentiation and apoptosis  <cit> . therefore it is likely that this gene product regulates cell death pathways linked to the commitment for sporulation.

furthermore, other highly upregulated genes are also functionally linked to the protein turnover. these include the fkbp <dig> rotamase, which accelerates the folding of proteins during synthesis; the psma <dig> proteasome subunit, which together with the other subunits, suffer changes during the meiotic cell cycle  <cit> ; and the endosome-lysosome vesicle traffic-related rr <dig>  <cit> . it is likely then that these gene products, together with sequestosome  <dig>  are linked to the control of differentiation through post-transcriptional regulation.

CONCLUSIONS
the gain of sporulation-competence of physarum plasmodia involves growth arrest, condensation of constituents, and mitosis and is a prerequisite before sporulation can be induced by light  <cit> . physarum gene expression has been shown to be cell type-specific, but existing studies have been focused only on individual genes  <cit> . previously, we reported a library of  <dig>  sequences obtained from plasmodia competent for the induction of sporulation  <cit> . in the present study we used the massive parallel sequencing technology at the level of the whole transcriptome  <cit>  in order to identify global changes in expression that occur during light-induced sporulation of physarum. we integrated the differentially expressed cdnas into networks using interaction information from orthologs and the literature. we found that after light induction of a plasmodium the expression of transcripts linked to cell division and dna repair is downregulated. in contrast, light-induction stimulated the expression of genes associated with protein turnover , genes related to cell cycle progression, and genes involved in the maintenance of cell integrity and cytokinesis. these latter gene products might protect the cell against osmotic shock. additionally, different groups of calcium-binding proteins are either down- or upregulated after light exposure. these gene products are candidates to control the intracellular calcium levels during sporulation. we postulate that these changes are associated with a network of actin-binding proteins , the components of which are differentially regulated upon plasmodial photoinduction. it seems that these gene products accomplish different tasks in each stage: the reorganization of the subcellular compartments in order to inhibit migration during starvation on one hand, and cell polarization and cytoskeletal redistribution after photoinduction mediated by a group of actin-binding proteins on the other. we expect that the precise representation of the proposed interaction networks may become available as gene knockout experiments, proteomic data, and comparative interactomics are integrated in future studies of this organism.
