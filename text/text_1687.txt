BACKGROUND
neuregulins are a family of ligands that signal through the four erbb receptor tyrosine kinases to activate pathways. this network mediates a wide range of processes that have relevance to both developmental processes and cancer, including cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation, migration and death  <cit> . our previous studies suggested that nrg <dig> signaling acts to promote the initiation of mammary placode development  <cit> . the cognate receptor for nrg <dig>  erbb <dig>  is required for terminal differentiation of the mammary gland and lactation fails in its absence  <cit> . impaired mammary epithelial proliferation and lobuloalveolar defects are also observed in nrg1α-null mice  <cit> . analysis of amphiregulin-null mice demonstrated the requirement of amphiregulin for ductal outgrowth at puberty  <cit> . studies of compound null mutations for genes for the egf-related ligands  demonstrated failed lactation due to abnormal alveolar development and differentiation, whereas no lactation defect is apparent when these genes are singly mutated  <cit> . studies of mammary tissue from erbb <dig> and erbb2-null mouse models have shown that these genes have important roles in mammary ductal outgrowth/morphogenesis  <cit> . mouse models which overexpress the ligand, nrg <dig>  or the erbb <dig> receptor  display severe hyperplastic epidermal and/or mammary phenotypes depending on the cell type specificity of promoter used to drive transgene expression  <cit> . these mouse models have provided a useful framework for understanding how this ligand/receptor network acts to promote differentiation, outgrowth, and carcinogenesis of epithelial tissues.

egf and egf-like ligands that signal through egfr were initially discovered and named due to their profound effects on epidermal development  <cit> . egf increases epidermal thickness and cellularity and stimulates proliferation of epidermal keratinocytes  <cit> . mice with targeted disruptions of egfr/erbb <dig> are usually embryonically lethal but this is strain-dependent, so it is possible to analyze hypomorphs, and viable strains display epithelial hypoplasia  <cit> . mice harbouring the waved- <dig> allele of egfr develop abnormal hair that appears wavy and also display a mild lactation defect  <cit> . other egf-like ligands expressed by keratinocytes include amphiregulin  <cit> , betacellulin  <cit> , heparin-binding egf-like growth factor  <cit> , and tgfα  <cit> . using wound healing models, nrg1/heregulin  has been implicated in epithelial migration and differentiation  <cit> . the nrg <dig> isoforms, hrgα and hrgβ, elicit different effects in cultured keratinocytes  <cit> ; hrgα acts as a potent motility factor whereas hrgβ has no effect on migration in wound healing assays  <cit> . in contrast, in normal melanocytes, hrgβ significantly enhances cell migration, but not proliferation, while hrgα has no effect on migration or cell growth of normal melanocytes  <cit> . despite the profound biological effects that egf-like ligands elicit, their modes of action are not yet fully understood, particularly with respect to their ability to regulate cell fate and lineage commitment.

mammary placodes are thought to arise as a result of local cell migration  <cit>  and early stages are characterized by epithelial stratification  <cit> . our previous studies indicated that nrg <dig> promotes the differentiation of squamous epithelia into mammary epithelia  <cit> . in the mouse embryo, nrg <dig> appears to regulate epithelial stratification or local epithelial aggregations at the sites that mammary placodes will form. mice harbouring the ska mutation, a hypomorphic allele of nrg <dig>  often fail to form placode three; this can be restored after culture with recombinant nrg3-egf. placode morphogenesis is governed by molecules that alter cell adhesion dynamics and, in some cases, proliferation of pluripotent epithelial cells  <cit> . in the mammary gland, as with the development of all epidermal appendages, undifferentiated stem cells are committed to specific lineages and a population of cells with a high capacity for proliferation is delimited, which subsequently differentiates  <cit> . the role of nrg <dig> signaling in the determination of epidermal stem cell fate remains largely uncharacterized. therefore, we developed a mouse model to examine the outcome of ectopic expression of nrg <dig> in the basal layer of the developing epithelia under the control of the keratin <dig>  promoter. this promoter results in expression beyond the normal spatial and temporal domains of nrg <dig> expression into the stem cell compartment. expression of nrg <dig> in the basal layer of the epidermis resulted in alterations in a variety of epidermal organs including the skin, hair follicles, sebaceous glands, external genitalia and mammary glands. analysis of epithelial differentiation and progenitor markers suggests that differentiation of progenitor cell populations is profoundly altered by nrg <dig> expression.

RESULTS
nrg <dig> is expressed in the developing epidermis and hair follicles
we have shown previously, using both in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, that nrg <dig> is expressed in the developing embryonic mouse epidermis from e12-e <dig>  <cit> . nrg <dig> is also expressed in developing hair follicles at e <dig>  . to investigate nrg <dig> expression in postnatal skin, we used immunohistochemistry on both frozen and fixed mouse epidermis . we found that nrg <dig> is expressed in the granular and cornified layers and in very few cells of the basal layer of the postnatal interfollicular epidermis, and at low to moderate levels in the hair follicles along the outer root sheath including the bulge and along the inner root sheath .

ectopic expression of nrg <dig> in the epidermis causes epidermal defects and early lethality
to extend the temporal and spatial range of nrg <dig> expression in the epidermis, and determine whether nrg <dig> can modulate the development of epidermis and its appendages, we generated transgenic mice expressing full-length nrg <dig> from the human k <dig> promoter . the k <dig> promoter is expressed in the periderm starting at e <dig>  and, once stratified, in the basal layer  of mouse epidermis and the outer root sheath of the hair follicles  <cit> . founder mice were produced by pronuclear injection of the linearized transgene into fertilized eggs . levels of transgene expression in the epidermis of mice were determined by immunohistochemistry or by in situ hybridization . six male k14-nrg <dig> transgenic founders exhibited a similar thickened, wrinkled, hairless phenotype that encompassed the entire skin of the animal . of these, four died a few days after birth or were unwell and were culled. however, two male founders expressing lower transgene levels were viable and exhibited hyperplastic epithelial phenotypes but did not display other epidermal appendage phenotypes, or the phenotypes were less severe. furthermore, two male founder mice that were mosaic for transgene levels expressed variable levels of transgene expression and were also viable.

histopathology of k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin
histological examination of seven independent k14-nrg <dig> transgenic founders revealed that the skin shared several unusual features. the epidermis displayed expanded suprabasal, granular and cornified layers when compared to non-transgenic littermates . nucleated cells were present throughout the epidermis, even in the later differentiated compartments, except for the cornified layers, which were anucleate. an increase in the cellular density of the dermis was also observed. a large infiltration of fibroblasts was apparent and the fat layer appeared much thinner in the transgenic skin. hair follicles were hyperplastic and mis-orientated within the dermis and sebaceous glands were mis-positioned and hyperplastic. all components of the hair follicle are present and differentiation proceeds normally but is disrupted at a very late stage so that the hair fiber either fails to form or when a fiber does form it does not penetrate through the thickened epithelium. however, mice derived from one lower expressing k14-nrg <dig> transgenic line did form some sparse wavy hair but only one hair type  was present compared to the four hair types normally found in non-transgenic littermates .

using an antibody to the egf domain of nrg <dig>  we detected nrg <dig> expression in the basal, suprabasal, and granular layers of the epithelium and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles in the transgenic founder lines . cytoplasmic and membrane staining is observed suggesting that both membrane-spanning and secreted forms of nrg <dig> are produced in the transgenic k14-nrg <dig> mice, as expected from the isoform of nrg <dig> present in the k14-nrg <dig> construct. non-transgenic littermates express nrg <dig> in a few basal and in the granular and cornified layers and low to moderate levels throughout the hair follicles .

altered erbb receptor activation is observed in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin
erbb <dig>  erbb <dig>  and erbb <dig> expression has been reported in both human and mouse skin  <cit> . erbb <dig> expression has not been reported in postnatal mouse epidermis although expression has been observed in both embryonic and adult human skin  <cit> . erbb <dig> is expressed in the epithelia of the developing mammary placode from the time it is morphologically distinct  <cit> . we examined expression of the four erbb receptors in both transgenic and non-transgenic postnatal skin. erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> are expressed in the basal epithelia and differentiating epidermal layers and in the outer root sheath of the hair follicles of both non-transgenic and transgenic skin . erbb <dig> is expressed in the basal, suprabasal layers and at higher levels in the granular epithelial layers and in the outer root sheath of the hair follicles of both transgenic and non-transgenic skin . in non-transgenic mouse epidermis, we detect only very low levels of erbb <dig> in the interfollicular epidermis and we observed low levels of expression in the hair follicles . however, in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin, we observed significantly increased levels of erbb <dig> in the epidermis  , which suggest that nrg <dig> expression in the basal epithelia might induce an autocrine signaling loop.

we explored the signaling events that mediate the nrg <dig> response in the epidermis. erbb <dig> is slightly more activated in the transgenic epidermis when compared to the non-transgenic epidermis . both erbb <dig> and erbb <dig> activation levels are similar in the transgenic and non-transgenic epidermis . ectopic nrg <dig> promotes a slight increase in the levels of erbb <dig> and a moderate increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of erbb <dig> in the transgenic epidermis . the possible active signaling complexes in the transgenic epidermis are therefore erbb1: <dig>  erbb1: <dig>  erbb1: <dig>  erbb2: <dig>  erbb2: <dig>  erbb4: <dig> since erbb <dig> requires a neuregulin binding receptor to signal and erbb <dig> homodimers are inactive.

signaling through the erbb <dig> receptor is complicated as four major variants of the receptor exist  <cit> . alternative splice variants of erbb <dig> are produced at two distinct sites resulting in four possible isoforms of the receptor. jm-a and jm-b variants encode variable extracellular juxtamembrane isoforms that can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteases   or are resistant to such cleavage   <cit> . two cytoplasmic variants also exist which contain  or lack  an exon corresponding to sixteen amino acids that encodes a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  docking site  <cit> . we examined the expression of erbb <dig> isoforms in the epidermis of three independent k14-nrg <dig> transgenic lines and compared them to the epidermis from non-transgenic siblings. cyt- <dig> and cyt- <dig> isoforms were expressed at similar levels in both the transgenic and non-transgenic epidermis . we found that unusual erbb <dig> jm isoform profiles exist in the transgenic epidermis that are distinct from those expressed in non-transgenic epidermis. similar levels of the jm-a and jm-b isoforms are expressed in non-transgenic epidermis. we observed deviations such that either jm-a or jm-b isoforms were preferentially expressed in the transgenic lines . these results suggest that misexpressing nrg <dig> in the epidermis alters the ratios of erbb <dig> jm splice isoform gene expression.

the jm-a domain of erbb <dig> encodes a cleavable receptor which can transmit signals to the cytoplasm and nucleus  <cit> . binding of nrg <dig> to the erbb <dig> jm-a ectodomain isoform results in the cleavage and shedding of the  <dig> kd ectodomain. this is mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha converting enzyme and results in the production of an  <dig> kd intracellular membrane-bound domain  <cit> . this domain can then be cleaved by gamma-secretase to release an  <dig> kd intracellular domain  <cit> . immunoprecipitate analysis of erbb <dig> receptor signaling detected no activated  <dig> kd isoform in the epidermis from transgenic or non-transgenic littermates . therefore, activated erbb <dig> exists predominantly in the  <dig> kd membrane-bound isoform in the epidermis of both transgenic and non-transgenic littermates .

k14-nrg <dig> transgenic mice exhibit other epithelial appendage phenotypes
we observed fewer k14-nrg <dig> transgenic females than predicted and the overall efficiency of transgenesis was low , suggesting that ectopic expression of nrg <dig> in the epidermis during embryogenesis may be partially lethal, particularly in females. four female transgenic founders with obvious skin phenotypes were obtained. of these, two were found dead shortly after birth. histological analysis showed a skin phenotype similar to that observed in the other male transgenic founders . the other two female founders both displayed a hairless, wrinkled, thickened, pale skin similar to that observed in the male founders except this was present on approximately half of the body of the mouse, consistent with integration of the transgene at the two-cell stage .

at p <dig>  these two female founders were scored for the number and placement of nipples on the ventral surface. in both females, in addition to the  <dig> pairs in the normal location , there were multiple ectopic nipples both along the "mammary line" and also in adjacent locations . results from breeding from these females were consistent with chimerism. the one transgenic male pup produced in the first litter displayed the same hairless, wrinkled, thickened, pale skin phenotype  shared by the other transgenic founder males and died at p <dig>  the female founder mice were culled to collect tissue samples for analysis and verify that mammary tissue  was associated with the ectopic nipples . ectopic nipples observed on transgenic mice are usually smaller than the endogenous nipples which are very large when compared to non-transgenic nipples  but varied considerably in size and are sometimes as large as the endogenous transgenic nipples . both endogenous and ectopic nipples express keratin2e, a nipple marker for mouse nipple epidermis  <cit>  .

both male and female mice exhibited enlarged external genitalia when compared to non-transgenic littermates . despite the increased size of the external genitalia, most mice were fertile and could breed. most transgenic founders displayed very sparse and wispy whiskers and one line eventually grew sparse and wavy hair . clusters of hair follicles were observed in some skin sections, which is indicative of abnormal patterning events . one transgenic founder line exhibited premature tooth eruption  but normal tooth number and cusp patterning were observed in these and other transgenic founder lines .

hyperproliferative marker profile but a normal terminal differentiation profile observed in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic interfollicular epidermis
the status of epidermal differentiation was assessed using immunohistochemistry of paraffin sections. although the epidermis is thicker in k14-nrg <dig> skin compared to non-transgenic littermates, markers of terminal epidermal differentiation were present. the distribution of filaggrin, a terminal differentiation marker, is maintained in the granular and cornified layers . similarly involucrin, another terminal differentiation marker is also expressed in the granular and cornified layers . the distribution of k <dig> and k <dig>  markers for committed early differentiating cells, are unaltered and remain in the suprabasal layer . neoplastic skin lesions generally display reduced k <dig> expression so the transgenic epidermis does not appear to be neoplastic. k <dig> and k <dig> were used as markers for the basal proliferating keratinocytes and showed markedly altered expression. both were expressed at high levels throughout the basal and suprabasal layers of k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin . another basal keratin, k <dig> is normally restricted to basal keratinocytes as observed in non-transgenic littermates  and marks undifferentiated cells with low turnover  <cit> . k <dig> expression is reduced in the basal interfollicular epidermis in k14-nrg <dig> basal epidermis . k <dig> expression is retained in the outer root sheath where it marks the bulge region of the hair follicle in both normal and mutant epidermis   <cit> . k <dig> expression is not compatible with keratinocyte activation and is frequently downregulated in hyperproliferative conditions  <cit> . the large expansion of suprabasal and granular layers observed in transgenic skin is also a feature of hyperproliferating conditions. ectopic expression of nrg <dig> in the basal layer deregulates the expression pattern of keratin markers, k <dig>  k <dig>  and k <dig> to one associated with hyperproliferation conditions. the terminal differentiation program of keratinocytes in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin is essentially normal and characterized by excessive production of terminally differentiated cells.

nrg <dig> signaling stimulates epidermal proliferation
the increased thickness of the epidermis suggested that nrg <dig> stimulates proliferation. ki <dig> was used as a proliferation marker for cells . in contrast to normal skin , the k14-nrg <dig> basal cells are nearly all ki67+ and many suprabasal cells are ki67+ . in one k14-nrg <dig> transgenic line, approximately 43% of the interfollicular epithelial cells are ki67+ compared to 26% observed in non-transgenic littermates in postnatal day  <dig> skin . normally, a restricted number of basal cells express cyclind <dig>  . however, cyclind <dig> expression is observed in the basal, suprabasal, and granular cell layers of k14-nrg <dig> epidermis . therefore, constitutive expression of nrg <dig> increases the number of cycling cells in the epidermis, including the basal layer.

sustained nrg <dig> signaling stimulates sebocyte differentiation
to examine the differentiation of sebaceous glands, we stained transgenic and non-transgenic skin with oil red o, which marks lipid- containing cells, including sebocytes. in normal skin, sebaceous glands were associated with the upper part of each hair follicle . in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin, the number and size of sebocytes was greatly increased . this is especially dramatic in skin samples collected from older mice, where essentially all of the abnormal hair follicles are filled with sebocytes and only few structures resembling hair follicles remain . this suggests that nrg <dig> signaling stimulates sebocyte differentiation. several studies have shown that c-myc activation stimulates sebocyte differentiation  <cit> , and therefore we examined c-myc expression. we found that k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin exhibited increased c-myc expression through most of the basal layer when compared to non-transgenic littermates . western blot analysis confirmed an increase in the levels of c-myc in k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin compared to non-transgenic littermates 

sustained nrg <dig> signaling perturbs basement membrane organization
the extracellular matrix receptor, β1-integrin, is preferentially expressed in many epidermal stem cells and thought to be required to maintain the stem cell compartment. β1-integrin exhibits reduced staining in k14-nrg <dig> epidermis when compared to non-transgenic littermates . the hemidesmosomal component, α6-integrin  <cit> , also displayed reduced staining in k14-nrg <dig> epidermis when compared to non-transgenic littermates . strong adhesion of the basal cells to the underlying basal lamina is provided by the hemidesmosomes. the aberrant staining of cell adhesion markers, α6-integrin and β1-integrin, suggest that partial dissolution of underlying basement membrane has occurred. tenascin-c, an adhesion-modulating extracellular matrix glycoprotein, is expressed along the basement membrane in the vicinity of hair follicles in normal epidermis . there is significant upregulation of tenascin-c within the basement membrane of k14-nrg <dig> skin .

nrg <dig> activity regulates the fate of epidermal progenitor cells
p <dig> is normally expressed in most basal epidermal cells and some suprabasal cells and is thought to act to maintain the proliferative potential of stem cells and to mediate epidermal differentiation  <cit> . p <dig> is expressed in cells with high proliferative potential and is absent in cells undergoing terminal differentiation. we observed expanded expression of p <dig> which was detected in up to four suprabasal cell layers in k14-nrg <dig> epidermis. . a similar distribution of ki67+ and p63+ cells was observed in the suprabasal layers . by definition, stem cells rarely cycle and the transit-amplifying cells are actively cycling  <cit> . this suggests that an increased number of quiescent stem cells are recruited into cell cycle and enter into the transit-amplifying compartment in k14-nrg <dig> epidermis. transit-amplifying cells divide several times to produce differentiated cells, which leads to terminal differentiation along various lineages. these results suggest that nrg <dig> can influence epidermal stem cell fate decisions and, when ectopically expressed in the basal epidermis, nrg <dig> promotes the differentiation of stem cells into epidermal and sebaceous lineages and not along the hair lineage.

discussion
we have shown that sustained expression of nrg <dig> in the basal epidermis alters the development of epidermal organs including the skin, hair, and mammary glands . modulation of nrg <dig> signaling affects the number of mammary glands by promoting initiation. we have not observed the induction of other ectopic organs in the k14-nrg <dig> founders aside from mammary glands. however, ectopic nrg <dig> did increase the size and alter the shape of most epithelial appendages, which is suggestive of morphogenetic changes. failure of proper hair differentiation occurred and, in the few cases where hair fibers formed and emerged, only one hair type, zigzag, developed . our observation of clusters of hair follicles suggests that in some regions, normal patterning is perturbed . in skin from older transgenic mice, the entire hair follicle structure is filled with sebocytes suggesting alterations in cell fate decisions have occurred .

k14-nrg <dig> transgenic mice form extra nipples associated with mammary ducts . the extra mammary glands develop along and close to the mammary line. although k <dig> is expressed in the epidermis from e <dig> , it is not upregulated until e <dig>  when strong k <dig> expression is observed in the basal layer of the epidermis, in the outer root sheath and in the bulge cells  <cit> . k <dig> upregulation therefore occurs after the mammary placodes have already formed. our k14-nrg <dig> transgenics were low copy number integrants and expressed low-levels of the transgene and it is possible that higher levels of expression might elicit other phenotypic effects if it were not lethal. our previous studies demonstrated both epidermal stratification  and placode formation adjacent to sites of ectopically delivered recombinant nrg3-egf domain in mouse embryo explant cultures  <cit> . the results reported here suggest that, at least in some cases, these ectopic placodes have the ability to complete the entire mammary morphogenetic program.

all four erbb receptors are expressed in the developing mouse epidermis providing a wide range of signaling possibilities as well as compensatory mechanisms . depending on the ligand and the availability of dimerization partners these receptors will then transmit quantitatively or qualitatively different signals in different cell types  <cit> . no significant elevations in egfr, erbb <dig>  or erbb <dig> were observed as assessed by immunohistochemistry and western blot . phosphotyrosine levels were used to assess the activation status of each receptor . erbb <dig> appeared to have slightly increased phosphotyrosine content in the transgenic epidermis. erbb <dig>  and erbb <dig> were active at similar levels in both the transgenic and non-transgenic epidermis. erbb <dig> is not normally expressed at significant levels in the postnatal interfollicular epidermis but is expressed throughout the k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin . we observed increased levels of erbb <dig> and tyrosine phosphorylation of erbb <dig> in the transgenic epidermis when compared to non-transgenic littermates. this is consistent with previous reports that erbb <dig> homodimers are the major receptor for nrg <dig>  <cit> . it is likely that cellular mechanisms exist to prevent autocrine signaling of nrg3-erbb <dig>  which can be overcome in the k14-nrg <dig> transgenic model. our findings suggest that increased erbb <dig> signaling in the k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin underlies the striking epidermal phenotypes observed in this transgenic model.

erbb <dig> is the preferred heterodimerization partner for all of the erbb receptors  <cit> , so it is likely that nrg <dig> elicits its effects through both erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers and erbb4-erbb <dig> homodimers . normal mammary ductal outgrowth occurs, but lactation fails in mammary glands from both heart-rescued erbb4-null mice  and from mice in which erbb <dig> has been conditionally deleted from the mammary gland  <cit> . lobular-alveolar units from mice lacking erbb <dig> in the mammary gland do not express markers of terminal differentiation and exhibit deficient proliferation of the mammary epithelium during pregnancy and at partuition. erbb <dig> signaling appears to be required for secretory maturation of the alveoli since milk genes are expressed albeit at reduced levels  <cit> . mammary glands from heart-rescued erbb2-null mice display mammary ductal outgrowth defects  <cit> . nrg <dig> signaling through erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers is required to elicit stat <dig> activation and neither erbb <dig> nor erbb <dig> homodimers alone can activate stat <dig> in vitro  <cit> . these results suggest that signaling through erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers is likely to be required to achieve terminal differentiation of the mammary gland, but not for ductal outgrowth. nrg1-null, erbb2-null, and erbb4-null mice all display myocardial trabeculation defects which indicates that nrg <dig> signaling through erbb2- erbb <dig> heterodimers is necessary for heart development  <cit> . distinct neural defects including mis-innervation of the hindbrain are found in erbb4-null mice and not in erbb2-null mice, which suggests that this signaling occurs without utilizing erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers  <cit> . erbb <dig> signaling regulates many other developmental pathways including the migration and differentiation of neuroblasts in the rostral-nasal stream, inhibiting cortical astrogenesis, hypothalamus-mediated reproductive development and function, and blastocyst implantation  <cit> . signaling through erbb <dig> is generally associated with cellular differentiation, particularly in the mammary gland  <cit> . erbb <dig> signaling is likely to be far more complex since active membrane-bound, nuclear and cytosolic forms of erbb <dig> exist and have been associated with other cellular processes, including apoptosis and transcriptional repression  <cit> . erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers have higher affinity than erbb <dig> homodimers  <cit> . signaling through erbb heterodimers is thought to result in more potent mitogenic response than signalling through erbb homodimers  <cit> . erbb <dig> can bind to more phosphotyrosine binding proteins, and signaling through erbb2-erbb <dig> heterodimers is generally thought to result in more diverse and distinct outputs than signaling through erbb <dig> homodimers  <cit> .

we observed unusual erbb <dig> jm variant profiles in the transgenic epidermis that are distinct from those observed in non-transgenic littermates. two recent studies have shown that both the cyt- <dig> isoform and jm-a isoform are overexpressed in the dorsolateral frontal cortex of schizophrenic patients and suggest that dysregulated splice variant expression of erbb <dig> may underlie the genetic association of erbb <dig> with schizophrenia  <cit> . the four different isoforms of erbb <dig> have different signaling capabilities and may mediate distinct biological functions  <cit> . the contribution of dysregulation of splice-variant specific expression of erbb <dig> in the k14-nrg <dig> transgenic skin to the phenotype we observe remains to be elucidated.

the postnatal k14-nrg <dig> hyperplastic epidermal phenotypes are likely to result from induction of signaling pathways that are not normally continuously activated. since both c-myc and cyclind <dig> are downstream target genes of β-catenin/lef  <cit>  and the wnt pathway has well-established roles in both epithelial proliferation  <cit> , cell fate  <cit> , and stem cell maintenance  <cit> , we examined wnt/β-catenin expression in the k14-nrg <dig> epidermis. however, we did not detect nuclear β-catenin, altered membranous β-catenin or e-cadherin stain or changes in lef <dig> expression in the transgenic epidermis .

k14-nrg <dig> epidermis displays features indicative of perturbed basement membrane organization, including reductions in α6-integrin and β1-integrin expression levels . α6-integrin and β1-integrin are cell surface molecules that mediate cell attachment and keratinocyte migration. both are highly expressed in stem cells and likely to have roles in stem cell maintenance  <cit> . both human and mouse epidermal stem cells are more adhesive to the extracellular matrix than their daughter cells  <cit> . reduced β1-integrin levels in human keratinocytes stimulates exit from the stem cell compartment  <cit> . β1-integrin is required for basement membrane remodelling and for downgrowth of hair follicles  <cit> . transgenic expression of nrg <dig> within the basal epidermis also induces tenascin-c, an adhesion-modulating extracellular matrix glycoprotein, which is often found at the sites of epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development and tissue remodeling   <cit> . these results suggest that nrg <dig> signaling elicits adhesive and extracellular matrix changes that are likely to have significant consequences on progenitor cell behaviour and morphogenetic events.

a number of studies have demonstrated that transgenic expression of c-myc in the basal cells of the epidermis promotes the differentiation of epidermal stem cells into sebaceous glands. this is a strikingly similar phenotype to our observations in the k14-nrg <dig> postnatal epidermis  <cit> . consistent with this similarity, c-myc expression is increased in the basal layer of k14-nrg <dig> skin  and changes in k14-nrg <dig> epidermis such as hyperproliferation and increase in cell size  are consistent with the increased basal expression of c-myc  <cit> . the extension of expression of p <dig> into a large number of suprabasal cells in k14-nrg <dig> skin  suggests that nrg <dig> might cause epidermal cells to exit the stem cell compartment and stimulate the proliferation of transit-amplifying cells, as is also observed in k14-c-myc transgenic skin  <cit> . also consistent with c-myc activation is the decreased α6-integrin and β1-integrin expression observed throughout most of the basal epidermis  <cit> . c-myc-induced repression of adhesion is thought to stimulate epidermal stem cell differentiation  <cit> . our data implies that nrg <dig> can alter the proliferation status of basal epidermal cells, most likely, through the induction of c-myc. however, there are important distinctions between the k14-nrg <dig> and k14-c-myc models. k14-c-myc mice do form hair which is gradually lost and other epithelial appendage phenotypes have not been reported  <cit> .

these results confirm our previous studies that nrg <dig> signaling can regulate epithelial cell fate during mammary gland morphogenesis and suggest nrg <dig> can also regulate other pluripotent cell populations in the epidermis. of particular interest is the ability of nrg <dig> to decrease α6-integrin and β1-integrin expression, as this could be the mechanism by which nrg <dig> normally elicits epithelial stratification and mammary differentiation at unique sites along the body axes during early mammary morphogenesis. alterations in basement membrane components are known to have profound effects on progenitor populations perhaps by disrupting the stem cell niche  <cit> . the niche is also significantly altered in transgenic mmtv-c-myc mammary epithelia, which show similar changes in stem cell retention and transit-amplifying cell fate decisions as observed in the k14-c-myc epidermis  <cit> . conditional deletion of c-myc in the epidermis leads to precocious differentiation and loss of the basal progenitor cells through insufficient expansion  <cit> . interestingly, another regulator of erbb signaling, lrig, an egfr antagonist, acts to maintain stem cell quiescence in part by negatively regulating the c-myc promoter  <cit> . conditional deletion of rac <dig>  a negative regulator of c-myc leads to rapid depletion of the stem cell compartment and highlights their critical roles in stem cell regulation  <cit> .

we propose that when nrg <dig> is ectopically expressed in to the postnatal period, as in the k14-nrg <dig> model, the transit-amplifying cells may differentiate to form the interfollicular epidermis and sebaceous lineages by effectively the same means as proposed by arnold and watt  <cit>  and frye et al.  <cit>  for the role of c-myc in the epidermis. in this model, sustained c-myc activation promotes sebaceous formation at the expense of the hair lineage; sustained nrg <dig> expression appears to elicit the same effect. c-myc expressing human keratinocytes exhibit decreased cell motility  <cit>  which could explain the failure of the hair lineage differentiation in both the k14-c-myc and k14-nrg <dig> models. keratinocytes must migrate out from the bulge down to receive the hair inductive signal from the dermal papilla  <cit> . it appears that the sebaceous lineage is conferred on keratinocytes that fail to migrate to the dermal papilla and remain in the bulge.

the exact mechanism by which mammalian epithelia stratifies is not known but p <dig> is central to this process as stratification fails in its absence  <cit> . recently p <dig> has been implicated as a key regulator of cellular adhesion and survival of basal cells in the mammary gland and other stratified epithelia  <cit> . two models have been proposed  for how the stratification of epithelia is elicited. to what degree these contribute to epithelial morphogenesis remains to be ascertained. the onset of stratification during embryogenesis is thought to be elicited by asymmetric cell division  <cit> . mammary placodes are thought to arise as a result of local cell migration  <cit>  but, initial stages are characterized by stratification  <cit> , which is thought to be elicited by basal cell proliferation.

changes in the adhesive properties of epithelial cells have been described as a general phenomena during the very early stages of bud formation of other organs including the hair follicle, submandibular gland, and mammary gland  <cit> . both desmosomal and hemidesmosomal expression profiles are downregulated during early mammary bud formation and thought to mediate differences in cell adhesive properties within the forming bud which are subsequently restored during later stages of mammary gland formation  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that epithelial cells that form the hair follicle respond to the inductive signals from the dermal mesenchyme by changing their cell adhesion properties and that this mediates early morphogenesis  <cit> . whether similar changes in adhesive processes are relevant to the very early stages of mammary development  remain to be determined. the expression of nrg <dig> in the dermal mesenchyme at the sites where mammary placodes will form prior to their morphological appearance and the ability of nrg <dig> to elicit placode formation in explanted embryo cultures would suggest nrg <dig> could mediate changes in the adhesive components of the epithelium that lead to formation of the mammary placode.

CONCLUSIONS
nrg <dig> is a key regulator of mammary fate. ectopic expression of nrg <dig> induces the formation of supernumerary mammary glands, the expression of c-myc, and promotes sebaceous gland fate rather than along the hair follicle lineage. deregulated nrg <dig> expression in stem cells reduces the expression of α6-integrin and β1-integrin, both of which are essential for stem cell maintenance and keratinocyte migration. nrg <dig> may have roles in promoting mammary lineage commitment and regulation of stem cell maintenance via c-myc. further studies of nrg <dig> are warranted to discern how mammary epithelial stratification is elicited, particularly with regard to how it coordinates interactions with other signaling pathways and to what degree basal epithelial proliferation contributes to this process.
