BACKGROUND
the evolution of the age schedule of reproduction is of central concern to life-history theory. organisms may be categorized according to their reproductive schedules: semelparous organisms  have a single, “big-bang” fatal reproductive episode, whereas iteroparous organisms  are capable of multiple reproductive episodes per lifetime  <cit> . cole  <cit>  presented a formal comparison of the fitness consequences of semelparity and iteroparity. he famously identified the persistence of iteroparity as a paradox: why is it so common, given that:  survival from one reproductive episode to the next is costly; and  to be fitness-equivalent to an iteroparous strategy, a semelparous strategy need only produce one additional offspring ? this problem was first resolved by pointing out that low juvenile establishment or survival lent the iteroparous strategy a fitness advantage  <cit> . this model, which focused on age-specific mortality, has since been refined  <cit> , but remains a general framework to explain the evolution of semelparity and iteroparity as discrete strategies.

as has been noted by others  <cit> , defining semelparity as instantaneous and fatal reproduction is ambiguous. it is unclear whether “fatal” precludes prolonged senescence, and whether “instantaneous” reproduction precludes production of more than a single offspring. unless only a single offspring is produced, total reproductive effort is by necessity packaged in multiple offspring that are rarely produced simultaneously. many examples of within-individual variation in the timing of semelparous reproduction in nature have been recognized. although some semelparous species reproduce relatively rapidly, especially long-lived semelparous plants  <cit> , others are reproductively active for an extended period of time  <cit> . for example, semelparous species such as capelin and crab spiders are capable of facultative iteroparity  <cit>  and many cephalopods, although considered semelparous, exhibit lengthy postreproductive senescence, with some capable of a second bout of reproduction  <cit> . although each of these life histories is semelparous in the sense that there is normally a terminal reproductive episode, they do not reproduce in a “single, massive, fatal reproductive episode”  <cit> , but distribute their total reproductive effort in multiple offspring over time.

attempts to model the fitness effects of reproductive strategies have often compared intrinsic rates of increase of annuals and perennials, where annuals are considered to be semelparous and perennials to be iteroparous. however, many semelparous organisms, such as bamboo, cicadas, yucca spp., are not annual  <cit> . multivoltine insects lay more than one brood per year, and their classification as semelparous or iteroparous may depend on the time scale of reference  <cit> . in seasonal climates, the digitizing effect of the cost of adult survival through an especially harsh event  results not only in dramatic integer changes in voltinism  <cit>  but also in annual and perennial life histories and the illusion of a strict dichotomy between semelparity and iteroparity. thus, categorization of life histories into semelparous and iteroparous is useful, but does not fully reflect an underlying biological reality.

we ask whether prolonged reproduction in species considered to be semelparous, although within a short lifespan, may be treated as iteroparous strategic packaging of reproductive effort in multiple bouts throughout life. together with evidence that semelparity is evolutionarily labile, with closely related species exhibiting both semelparous and iteroparous life histories  <cit> , it seems reasonable to consider parity as a continuum of intermediate strategies between endpoints of pure semelparity  and pure iteroparity, a large number of small clutches, produced in discrete reproductive bouts. following this logic, prolonged semelparity refers to a strategy where reproduction is expressed over a longer period of time than under pure semelparity.

although numerous examples of prolonged semelparity exist, no study has attempted to address the life-history question of whether this phenomenon is indicative of phenotypic continuity between semelparity and iteroparity  <cit> . two alternative explanations for prolonged semelparity exist: it may be a single reproductive episode that simply cannot be expressed instantaneously, in which case there would be no reason to consider the phenomenon to be iteroparity. in contrast, we hypothesize that prolonged semelparity is iteroparity on a short time scale, in which case reproductive allocation within a lifetime will vary depending on expected adult survival. differences in parity among semelparous species may exist, but it is not obvious how the continuum hypothesis could be tested in a species comparison. however, within a species, variation in reproduction along the semelparity-iteroparity continuum  may be expressed as phenotypic plasticity, i.e. the capacity for one genotype to express multiple environment-dependent phenotypes  <cit> . if a species’ reproductive allocation pattern is phenotypically plastic, manipulating season length cues should change the instantaneousness of the reproductive episode. this hypothesis has not yet been explicitly tested in either plants or animals, but anecdotal evidence in animals exists. for example, age at first reproduction influenced the amount of reproductive effort invested in offspring production and defense in sockeye salmon, oncorhynchus nerka <cit> . previous work has modeled the optimal timing of initiation of the single, irreversible transition to reproduction in annual plants  <cit> . however, because reproduction in these organisms is treated as a single event, no study has addressed the question of how reproductive effort is expressed or packaged following the initiation of reproduction.

in this study, we test the parity continuum hypothesis by manipulating effective season length—and thus, expected reproductive lifespan—available to replicated genetic lineages of the monocarpic plant lobelia inflata. this species provides an appropriate model for five main reasons:  it is classically semelparous;  reproductive effort is realized over a extended period of time during its single growing season in nature;  it is obligately autogamous, and therefore genotypically-invariant lineages are readily obtained; 4) total reproductive effort can be directly assessed because reproduction is exclusively by seed, and both male and female fitness contributions are obtained in one plant; and  l. inflata has a simple acropetal flowering pattern, where fruits form sequentially along inflorescences, making it possible to track the packaging of reproductive effort.

manipulation of effective season length was accomplished by inducing bolting in groups of experimental plants at different times  during the growing season. progressively later bolting over the period june through september results in diminishing time available for reproduction before the onset of frosts in mid-october. if the semelparity-iteroparity continuum hypothesis is correct, late bolting should elicit a progressively more semelparous reproductive strategy; that is, late-bolting plants should exhibit a reproductive episode that trades off other aspects of reproductive success for relatively prompt and simultaneous reproduction. specifically, we predict that, for l. inflata, more extreme semelparity in response to late bolting will be expressed as short time to first flowering and small size at first flowering, more synchronous flowering , and the production of smaller and/or fewer seeds. in contrast, if prolonged semelparity is the expression of a single strategy , late bolting will result either in no change or decelerating reproduction as a direct  plastic response to declining resources and deteriorating conditions toward the end of the growing season.

RESULTS
over the course of this experiment,  <dig>  plants from  <dig> genotypic lineages were tracked . these plants represent only those that germinated on time, rooted successfully, initiated bolting during the five-day window for each bolting group, and reproduced undisturbed  until the onset of senescence.

likelihood ratio tests showed that a glmm explained significantly more variation in the response for three traits , whereas a glmm and glm explained similar proportions of the total variation in the response variable for the other four traits . using these models, we found significant differences among bolting months for all seven reproductive traits included in this manipulation experiment . in general, early-bolting plants reproduced more slowly and produced fewer, larger seeds than late-bolting plants.

discussion
reproduction in l. inflata showed significant phenotypic plasticity of key reproductive traits diagnostic of semelparity in response to time constraints imposed by the manipulation of bolting date. variation in the expression of the degree of semelparity was consistent with the continuum hypothesis and inconsistent with the single strategy hypothesis: in lab and field environments alike, reproductive traits varied continuously as plants bolted later on in the season. june-bolting plants expressed prolonged semelparity , while september-bolting plants expressed a more instantaneous or extreme semelparity . although there was substantial variation among individual plants that bolted at different times throughout the season, there were no consistent differences among the  <dig> genetic lineages.

our results support the continuum hypothesis for each of our main predictions with respect to flowering traits. perhaps most importantly, late-bolters initiated reproduction sooner after bolting and at a smaller size than did early-bolters. flowering soon after bolting and flowering at a small size allows a plant to reproduce sooner, but may cause plants to forego fitness gains associated with production of a larger stalk, which can hold more fruit and disperses seeds farther  <cit> . that late-bolting plants would trade off such gains for the ability to initiate reproduction sooner and at a smaller size is consistent with the general prediction of the continuum hypothesis that late-bolting plants respond to a constrained reproductive season by adopting a more extreme semelparous reproductive strategy. late-bolters also flowered more synchronously, by fruiting in parallel more frequently and producing many more fruit than early bolters. although producing many flowers simultaneously may increase maximum fecundity, competition for resources between them may eventually lead to diminishing fitness gains for additional flowers  <cit> .

branching and fruiting patterns were phenotypically plastic across bolting groups. late-bolting plants produced significantly more fruit and more branches than early-bolting plants. this pattern was not necessarily predicted by the continuum hypothesis, but it makes sense in view of the morphology of our study species: producing fruit on multiple branches allowed late-bolting plants to overcome constraints on fruit production related to the growth of the meristem; late-bolters were able to produce flowering in parallel rather than serially along the main stalk. greater numbers of fruit also helped late-bolters produce a greater number of seeds–although early-bolters produced larger seeds, the total fecundity of late-bolters was significantly higher than that of early-bolters. presumably, there is a context-dependent fitness cost associated with branching in l. inflata; otherwise, early-bolting individuals should also express branching architecture. we speculate that advantages of main stem dominance in early bolters may include better dispersal in taller plants, and higher diversification in timing of seed production, and thus in timing of germination  <cit> . for time-constrained plants late in the season, however, branching provides an outlet for reproductive potential that would otherwise be wasted.

early-bolters produced fewer, larger seeds than late-bolters, a pattern that is consistent with the prediction that late-bolters would express “pure” semelparity, while early-bolters might express a more iteroparous-like semelparity  <cit> . larger seeds show reduced dormancy  <cit> , and are more likely than smaller seeds to germinate and establish rosettes within the same season. in contrast, late-bolters produced seeds in many fruits simultaneously, realizing higher fecundity at smaller seed size, although small seeds produced late in the season will be required to overwinter before forming rosettes  <cit> . in l. inflata, differences in offspring traits among fruits produced at different times suggest that a transition from a high-quality to high fecundity strategy occurs as the prospect of offspring establishment diminishes through the season   <cit> ; in our study, plants bolting at different times exhibit a similar pattern. this is likely due to the fact that seeds produced early in life are more likely to survive to reach reproductive maturity  <cit> .

bolting month was consistently the best predictor of reproductive traits. this signifies that reproductive allocation is phenotypically plastic with respect to time, and that environmental factors related to bolting month  act as cues to trigger different allocation strategies. the consistency between lab bolting month groups which, although sharing the same photoperiod schedule, were sheltered from various stressors  experienced by their field counterparts, suggests that day length is a potent environmental cue governing allocation strategy. because all bolting month groups were composed of the same  <dig> genotypic lineages, and genotype was included as an effect in our mixed model design, genotypic differences were excluded as an explanation for differences among bolting groups. rosette size was included as an effect in our model, but did not consistently predict phenotypic differences between bolting groups, as we would have expected if plant size, or direct effects associated with plant size, largely determined reproductive allocation patterns.

other fixed effects included in our model , as well as interaction effects  were significant predictors of for one or more reproductive traits, although the effect sizes  were typically small . differences between plant growth environments showed a consistent pattern: relative to lab-grown plants, field-grown plants generally initiated flowering at a larger size, and produced more branches and seeds, but also showed greater variability in reproductive characters. year was not a significant predictor of most of our reproductive traits, but where it was, this was presumably due to maternal effects related to seed age , or, in the case of significant year*bolting month interaction effects, maternal effects that affected bolting date-specific reaction norms . easier to interpret were year*environment interaction effects, which predicted a significant amount of the variation in reproductive traits, mostly because differences in seasonal weather among years affected field plants and not lab plants. for instance, in  <dig> eastern canada experienced a warm, abnormally rainy summer, resulting in all field plants flowering at a smaller size, and producing more branches, fruit and seed. significant bolting month*environment interaction effects showed that fluctuating weather affected plant growth at some bolting months more than others; for instance, in  <dig>  the pattern of increased branching became more pronounced in later bolting months, with field plants bolting in september  <dig> showing the greatest number of branches produced by any block in the study. despite the importance of these additional effects, bolting month was the only effect that significantly predicted all reproductive traits in our study.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our data demonstrate that a classically semelparous plant exhibits variation in parity expression that is consistent with adaptive phenotypic plasticity. other studies  <cit>  have shown intriguing evidence of plasticity in reproductive life histories, and here we explicitly test whether plasticity in reproductive behaviour can be explained as plasticity in the expression of parity along a continuum. that reproductive traits vary predictably with bolting date implies that, in l. inflata, degree of parity responds in a plastic manner to environmental cues and its expression is continuous. this substantiates the notion that there is a meaningful continuum of reproductive traits from a pure semelparous strategy to a prolonged semelparous strategy of iteroparous-like reproductive packaging over a substantial proportion of its lifespan.

conceptual and mathematical models identify the conditions under which annual semelparity has a selective advantage over perennial iteroparity, where semelparous and iteroparous life histories are discrete alternatives. our data suggest that these models, because they implicitly consider invariant extreme semelparity and iteroparity, describe the special cases of endpoints of a continuum. our results suggest that parity may be treated as phenotypically plastic and continuous over shorter time scales, as variation in key reproductive traits yields a life history that falls between the absolute extremes of pure iteroparity and semelparity. inferences about the generality of these conclusions will require study of reproductive allocation in other classically semelparous organisms, or in iteroparous organisms in which reliable cues for residual reproductive value may be perceived by individuals.
