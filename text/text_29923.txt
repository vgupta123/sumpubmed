BACKGROUND
excess light energy will result in the accumulation of reducing equivalents in the form of nadph generated by photochemical reactions. the accumulation of the reducing equivalents in the chloroplasts causes the over-reduction of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and accelerates the generation of reactive oxygen species , leading to the disruption of the photosynthetic apparatus   <cit> . however, because most plants cannot escape from exposure to excess light, they have evolved various defence mechanisms to dissipate excess light energy, such as non-photochemical quenching   <cit> , cyclic electron flow around psi/ii   <cit>  and the water-water cycle   <cit> . though such intra-chloroplastic defence systems have been studied extensively, little is known about the extra-chloroplastic defence systems  <cit> .

it has been shown that excess reducing equivalents in the form of nadph generated by photosynthesis can be transported to the cytosol, peroxisomes and mitochondria via shuttle machineries, such as the malate-oxaloacetate  shuttle  <cit> , where they are oxidised in metabolic pathways under photoinhibitory conditions. in the mitochondria, the excess reducing equivalents can be oxidised by the respiratory electron transport chain. the respiratory electron transport in the mitochondria of higher plants uses two different pathways, the cyanide-sensitive cytochrome oxidase  pathway and the cyanide-resistant alternative oxidase  pathway  <cit> . the cox pathway accomplishes most of the atp production in the plant mitochondria, whereas proton translocation and atp synthesis are uncoupled in the aox pathway  <cit> . therefore, the aox pathway is a non-phosphorylating pathway and can efficiently oxidise the reducing equivalents generated in the chloroplasts without being restricted by the proton gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane or the cellular atp/adp ratio. in fact, several studies have demonstrated that the aox pathway functions as a sink for the excess reducing equivalents generated by photosynthesis   <cit> . therefore, it has been speculated that the aox pathway may play a particular role in protecting plants from photoinhibition  <cit> ; however, the exact mechanism by which the mitochondrial aox pathway alleviates photoinhibition remains to be elucidated.

as described above, npq acts as a mechanism to protect plants from the damage caused by excess light energy, which has been studied for many years  <cit> . however, most of the studies on npq have focused on the regulations and molecular mechanisms, emphasising the pivotal roles of the trans-thylakoid membrane proton gradient  and the xanthophyll cycle  <cit> . less attention has been paid to the question of the type of electron flow that is responsible for the formation of the thylakoid Δph, which drives the conversion of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin via the intermediate antheraxanthin  <cit> .

the induction of npq requires a thylakoid Δph generated by photosynthetic electron transport to activate the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin  <cit> . however, under intense light conditions, the photosynthetic electron transport system becomes filled up with electrons due to the accumulation of excess reducing equivalents and the insufficient regeneration of both nadp+ and adp  <cit> . under such conditions, alternative electron sinks play important roles in the maintenance of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, resulting in a buildup of the thylakoid Δph.

in previous studies, two alternative electron sinks are proposed for the induction of npq through the formation of the thylakoid Δph . the first such sink is the cyclic electron flow around psi   <cit> . miyake et al.  <cit>  have already reported that cef-psi activity is required as an alternative electron flow to produce the thylakoid Δph and synthesise more atp for co <dig> assimilation. meanwhile, these researchers demonstrate that cef-psi always has a higher activity than that required for co <dig> assimilation, especially when the plants are under high light intensity and at a low concentration of co <dig>  they prove that cef-psi contributes to the formation of the thylakoid Δph, driving the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin and leading to the strong induction of npq. the second alternative electron pathway is the water-water cycle   <cit> . when the electron flux in psii exceeds the total electron flux required for co <dig> assimilation and photorespiration, reducing equivalents are rapidly generated by the photochemical reaction in the form of nadph. molecular oxygen may then substitute as an electron acceptor in the wwc to allow the linear electron flow to continue, forming a Δph across the thylakoid membranes to drive the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin. therefore, the wwc plays a central role in the induction of npq.

the cef-psi and the wwc are two major alternative electron flows to generate the thylakoid Δph and lead to the induction of npq in the chloroplasts. as described above, it has also been suggested that the mitochondrial aox pathway functions as an alternative sink for the excess electrons generated by photosynthesis , similarly to the cef-psi and the wwc . it remains unclear whether the mitochondrial aox pathway also contributes to the thylakoid Δph to induce the induction of npq as an extra-chloroplastic sink for the electrons. in the present work, we examined the effects of the inhibition of the aox pathway by various concentrations of sham on the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient, the photosynthetic fluorescence parameters, the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle  and the induction of npq in rumex k- <dig> leaves. the physiological function of the aox pathway in the induction of npq during the steady state and the induction phase of photosynthesis was confirmed, and the photoprotection mechanisms of the aox pathway are discussed. the rumex k- <dig> used in this study, a hybrid of rumex patientia × r. tianschaious, is a salt-tolerant fodder crop with a high content of leaf protein that is used in northwestern china for the reclamation of saline soil.

RESULTS
the effects of sham treatments on Φpsii, qp and npq in the isolated intact rumex k- <dig> chloroplasts
salicylhydroxamic acid  has been widely used to inhibit the aox pathway  <cit> . given that several components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in the chloroplasts are similar to those in the respiratory chain of the mitochondria, we examined whether the concentrations of sham used in this study had direct effects on the photosynthetic electron transport chain. the results demonstrated that the treatments with  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  or  <dig> mm sham had no direct effects on the actual psii photochemical efficiencies , the photochemical quenching coefficients  or the non-photochemical quenching  in intact chloroplasts isolated from rumex k- <dig> leaves , suggesting that the concentrations of sham used in this study had no direct effects on photosynthetic behaviours.

the effects of sham treatments on the aox pathway capacities and the nadp-malate dehydrogenase  initial activities in rumex k- <dig> leaves
to determine a working concentration of the inhibitor for this study, we examined the effects of the inhibitor on the capacities of the aox pathways in rumex k- <dig> leaves in the dark or in intense light. figure  <dig> a shows that the aox pathway capacity increased significantly after intense light treatment of the control leaves. treatments with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm sham inhibited approximately 34%, 57%, and 71% and 38%, 56%, 68% of the aox pathway capacities in the dark and in the intense light, respectively. the initial activity of nadp-malate dehydrogenase  increased by approximately 265% after intense light treatment of the control leaves. the sham treatments did not alter the initial activities of nadp-mdh in the dark. however, under intense light, the initial activities of nadp-mdh decreased by approximately 19%, 29% and 38% in rumex k- <dig> leaves treated with  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm sham, respectively .

the effects of sham treatments on the chlorophyll a fluorescence transients and the p <dig> redox state in rumex k- <dig> leaves
the chlorophyll a transient has become one of the most popular tools in photosynthetic research  <cit> . the shape of the ojip transient is very sensitive to environmental stresses. strasser and strasser  <cit>  developed a procedure to quantify the ojip transient, known as the jip-test. with this test, it is possible to calculate several phenomenological and biophysical expressions of the photosynthetic electron transport chain  <cit> . the jip-test is thus a powerful tool for the in vivo investigation of photosynthetic behaviours, including the energy fluxes of absorption, trapping and electron transport  <cit> . in the present study, we used the chlorophyll a fluorescence transient  to detect changes in photosynthetic behaviours when the aox pathway was inhibited.

before intense light treatment, both the control and the sham-treated leaves showed a typical ojip transient in the presence of both  <dig> mm  and  <dig> mm  nahco <dig>  however, the intense light-treatment markedly lowered the fluorescence intensity and altered the shapes of the ojip transients in both the control and the sham-treated leaves in the presence of  <dig> mm nahco <dig> . when the transients were presented in the form of Δvt  according to the jip-test, it was observed that the relative variable fluorescence at the j-step  became distinct in the sham-treated leaves compared with the control leaves under intense light. additionally, the j-step increased significantly with the increase in the sham concentration . however, the changes in the ojip transients under intense light due to the inhibition of the aox pathway were decreased in the presence of  <dig> mm nahco <dig> , which suggests that the high concentration of nahco <dig> markedly lowered the susceptibility of rumex k- <dig> leaves to sham treatments.

furthermore, the extent of the reduction of p700+ was more pronounced in the sham-treated leaves than in the control leaves, and the reduction extent of p700+ increased with the increase in the sham concentration .

the effects of sham treatments on the etr, qp and photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate in rumex k- <dig> leaves
changes in the psii electron transport rate , the qp and the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate in rumex k- <dig> leaves treated with various concentrations of sham are depicted in figure  <dig>  this figure shows that the etr , the qp  and the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate  decreased significantly with the increase in the sham concentration.

the effects of sham treatments on the ms-delayed light emission , the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle  and npq in rumex k- <dig> leaves
the ms-delayed light emission  of chlorophyll fluorescence has been used to monitor the thylakoid Δph  <cit> . the ms-dle from the sham-treated leaf discs was lower than that from the control leaves after intense light treatment , suggesting that the inhibition of the aox pathway restricted the formation of thylakoid Δph.

the actual de-epoxidation status of the xanthophyll cycle pigment pool /) was positively correlated with the Δpri ; therefore, the Δpri was used to estimate the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle in the experiment. figure  <dig> b shows that the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle  decreased significantly with the increase in the sham concentration in rumex k- <dig> leaves. the Δpri in the leaves treated with  <dig> mm sham was approximately 69% of that in the control leaves.

furthermore, with the increase in the sham concentration, npq and qe  decreased, whereas qi  increased in rumex k- <dig> leaves in the presence of  <dig> mm and  <dig> mm nahco <dig> . compared with the control leaves, npq and qe decreased by approximately 17% and 35%, respectively, and qi increased by approximately 99% in  <dig> mm sham-treated leaves in the presence of  <dig> mm nahco <dig> . this result showed that the contribution of qe to npq was more significant than that of qi. the changes in npq, qe and qi were less in the presence of  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  the npq decreased by approximately 9%, the qe decreased by approximately 18%, and the qi increased by 54% in  <dig> mm sham-treated leaves compared with those in the control leaves in the presence of  <dig> mm nahco <dig> .

the effects of sham treatments on the etr, qp and npq during the induction phase of photosynthesis in rumex k- <dig> leaves
the effects of sham treatments on fv/fm in rumex k- <dig> leaves
to examine the effect of the inhibition of the aox pathway on the photoinhibition of psii, we measured the maximal quantum yield of psii  in rumex k- <dig> leaves after the leaves were transferred to intense light from darkness . the fv/fm in the control and the sham-treated leaves decreased after exposure to intense light, and the inhibition of the aox pathway accelerated the decrease in fv/fm after  <dig> minutes of illumination.

the effects of sham treatments on the hydrogen peroxide  contents in rumex k- <dig> leaves
to visualise h2o <dig> accumulation, we stained the leaves with  <dig>  3-diaminobenzidine . the inhibition of the aox pathway by sham significantly enhanced the generation of h2o <dig> under intense light, and the accumulation of h2o <dig> increased significantly with the increase in the sham concentration , which indicates that the sham-treated rumex k- <dig> leaves suffered more from photo-oxidative stress compared with control leaves under intense light.

discussion
the excess reducing equivalents generated in the chloroplasts under intense light can be transported to other organelles via the malate-oaa shuttle and oxidised in metabolic pathways  <cit> . nadp-mdh is a key enzyme in the malate-oaa shuttle  <cit> . it is noteworthy that the initial activity of nadp-mdh noticeably increased in rumex k- <dig> leaves under intense light , indicating that the malate-oaa shuttle was activated to transport the excess reducing equivalents generated in the chloroplasts to other organelles. these equivalents transported from chloroplasts can be oxidised by the respiratory electron transport chain  <cit> . it is suggested that in this situation, the aox pathway, which is a non-phosphorylating electron transport pathway, plays a role in the dissipation of the chloroplast-derived reducing equivalents  <cit> . the fact that the aox capacity is significantly increased  under intense light supports this suggestion.

sham, a well-known inhibitor of the mitochondrial aox pathway, has been widely used to address the interaction between the chloroplasts and the mitochondria in either mesophyll protoplasts or intact tissues  <cit> . the  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> mm sham not affecting Φpsii, qp and npq in the isolated intact chloroplasts in the leaves of rumex k- <dig> , together with the sham treatments not altering the ojip transients  in the dark, demonstrates that the concentrations of sham used in this study had no direct effects on photosynthetic behaviours, which was also previously documented by padmasree and raghavendra  <cit> , bartoli et al.  <cit>  and yoshida et al.  <cit>  in their studies with other plant materials. therefore, all of the effects caused by the sham treatments in the study actually resulted from the inhibition of the mitochondrial aox pathway. furthermore, the sham treatments did not change the initial activity of nadp-mdh in the dark , which indicates that the concentration of sham had no direct effect on the initial activity of nadp-mdh.

it has been reported that, when reducing equivalents accumulate in the mitochondria, the activity of the malate-oaa shuttle will be reduced by a feedback mechanism  <cit> . therefore, it is reasonable to consider that, under intense light, the significant decrease in the initial activity of nadp-mdh by the inhibition of the aox pathway  was due to the accumulation of reducing equivalents in the mitochondria because the consumption of reducing equivalents via the aox pathway was inhibited. the significant decrease in the initial activity of nadp-mdh would inevitably limit the exportation of reducing equivalents from the chloroplasts to the mitochondria, resulting in the accumulation of reducing equivalents in the chloroplast stroma. the sham treatments pronouncedly altered the ojip transients under intense light , suggesting that the inhibition of the aox pathway significantly influenced the performance of the photosynthetic machinery. the fact that p <dig> was more reduced in the sham-treated leaves under intense light compared with control leaves  indicates that the inhibition of the aox pathway caused an over-reduction of the psi acceptor side under intense light due to the accumulation of excess reducing equivalents in the chloroplasts. additionally, according to the jip-test, the relative variable fluorescence at the j-step increased significantly with the increase in the sham concentration , indicating that the acceptor side of psii was more reduced  <cit>  under intense light. as a consequence, the photochemical quenching coefficient  decreased, and the photosynthetic linear electron transport flow was restricted, the latter of which was indicated by the significant decreases in the etr and the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate .

it should be emphasised that the electron fluxes between the photosynthetic etr  and the mitochondrial aox pathway  are noticeably different. the generation of reducing equivalents by photosynthesis is over  <dig> times higher than the consumption by the aox pathway. therefore it is difficult to understand how such a low electron flux via the aox pathway can become a significant sink for photosynthetic electrons. in this experiment, the photosynthetic etr was determined in the leaf discs exposed to air, but the respiratory rate was determined in the leaf discs submerged in solution. thus, the significant difference between the photosynthetic electron transport flow and the mitochondrial aox pathway electron flux could be partially due to the different determination conditions. the results of the experiment determining the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate  further support the above suggestion. therefore, the electron flux of the aox pathway may be underestimated in the experimental conditions. in addition, dinakar et al.  <cit>  suggested that the restriction of electron transport through the mitochondrial aox pathway in the cellular environment is simultaneously coordinated with a decline in photosynthesis by the production of biochemical signals, even though the flux of the aox pathway is very low. therefore, the inhibition of the aox pathway down-regulated the photosynthetic electron flow not only by the loss of the sink of excess reducing equivalents but also by the production of certain biochemical signals.

the induction of qe  requires a thylakoid Δph generated by the photosynthetic linear or/and cyclic electron transport to activate the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin  <cit> . in the present work, the observation that ms-dle and Δpri decreased gradually with the increase in the sham concentration under intense light  suggests that the restriction of the photosynthetic linear electron flow due to the inhibition of the aox pathway limited the generation of the thylakoid Δph and the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to zeaxanthin. therefore, the induction of the major and fast component of npq, qe, was suppressed in the sham-treated leaves  because of the restriction of the de-epoxidation of the xanthophyll cycle. in this instance, the slow component of npq, qi, was induced to dissipate excess light energy under intense light . the restriction in npq induction due to the inhibition of the aox pathway  was mainly attributable to the suppression of qe. the restriction in npq induction under intense light was also observed by zhang et al.  <cit>  in arabidopsis aox1a mutant, which further supports the above observation. in this way, a close link between the induction of npq and the aox pathway is established.

however, the detailed mechanisms of how the aox pathway generates an additional Δph under excess light are still unclear, as under excessive light, the Δph across the thylakoid membrane is not only because of an accumulation of reduced nadph but also because of the limiting concentrations of adp. further studies are needed to address this question.

to further confirm the role of the aox pathway, we examined the effects of the inhibition of the aox pathway on npq induction at a higher nahco <dig> concentration . the fact that the effects of the sham treatments on the shape of the chlorophyll a fluorescence transients  were less pronounced at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> than at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> indicates that higher concentration of nahco <dig> might maintain the photosynthetic electron transport chain in a more oxidised state to allow the photosynthetic linear electron flow to move faster because a higher concentration of the intercellular co <dig> acted as an efficient electron acceptor. this idea was also demonstrated by padmasree and raghavendra  <cit>  and by our pre-experiment work showing that the photosynthetic o <dig> evolution rate in rumex k- <dig> leaf discs was significantly higher at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> than at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> . hence, the effect of the inhibition of the aox pathway on the photosynthetic behaviours at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> was smaller than that at  <dig> mm nahco <dig>  the observation that the effects of the sham treatments on the induction of npq , qe  and qi  at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> were less than the effects at  <dig> mm nahco <dig> under intense light further supports the viewpoint that the aox pathway plays an important role in the induction of npq. all of these results suggest that the aox pathway can decrease the extent of the reduction of the psi acceptor side and the extent of the excitation of the psii reaction centres through the dissipation of excess reducing equivalents in chloroplasts and the induction of npq.

furthermore, during the induction phase of photosynthesis, the increases in the etr  and qp  were restricted by various concentrations of sham after two minutes of illumination, which suggests that the aox pathway is also essential for the maintenance of the photosynthetic linear electron transport flow during the induction phase of photosynthesis. consequently, the inhibition of the aox pathway suppressed the development of npq after two minutes of illumination . meanwhile, after the leaves were transferred from intense light to darkness, the differences in the level of npq among the leaves treated with various concentrations of sham were abolished within one minute . because qe, but not qi is quickly quenched after the leaves are transferred to darkness  <cit> , the restriction in npq development due to the inhibition of the aox pathway is attributable to the suppression of qe formation. therefore, during the induction phase of photosynthesis, the aox pathway should also be required to produce a thylakoid Δph and drive the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin to induce npq. this possibility is supported by the report that nadp-mdh, the key enzyme of the malate-oaa shuttle, is almost fully activated within two minutes of illumination in dark-adapted mesophyll protoplasts of pea  <cit> .

a substantial accumulation of h2o <dig> was observed in the sham-treated leaves under intense light , which suggests that the aox pathway may function as an antioxidant mechanism to suppress the generation of ros. it has been known that when psi is over-reduced, more ros will be produced at the acceptor side of psi. based on the above results, we assume that the aox pathway suppresses the generation of ros maybe by alleviating the over-reduction of the psi acceptor side and accelerating the induction of npq.

it has been suggested that ros can induce the inactivation of the repair of the photodamaged psii by suppressing the de novo synthesis of the d <dig> protein  <cit> , which therefore limits the photosynthetic etr. additionally, our recent study  <cit>  showed that the aox pathway protects plants against photoinhibition by alleviating the inhibition of the repair of the photodamaged psii through preventing the formation of ros in rumex k- <dig> leaves. therefore, the enhancement of photoinhibition by the sham treatment is most likely partially caused by the inhibition of the repair of the photoinhibited psii by h2o <dig>  it could be argued that the suppression of the npq induction is due to the production of ros. compared with the control leaves, the development of npq was suppressed after two minutes of illumination . however, the extent of the photoinhibition was accelerated after  <dig> minutes of illumination  in the sham-treated leaves, suggesting that the suppression of the npq induction is at least partially due to the inhibition of the aox pathway by sham under photoinhibition conditions. dinakar et al.  <cit>  indicated that any perturbation in the capacities of the aox or cox pathway of mitochondrial oxidative electron transport in light leads to disturbances in the maintenance of photosynthesis through modulations of ros, antioxidant enzymes and antioxidant molecules. these authors suggested that ros and antioxidant metabolites could act as biochemical signals during the beneficial interactions of the mitochondrial metabolism with photosynthesis. therefore, we do not disregard the side effects of ros production on photosynthetic electron transport and on the induction of npq after the occurrence of serious photoinhibition. however, further investigation is required to clarify how the restriction in electron transport through the aox pathway or the cox pathway of mitochondria in the cellular environment is simultaneously coordinated with the decline in photosynthesis through changes in ros and different components of the antioxidant system.

CONCLUSIONS
the inhibition of the aox pathway resulted in the rapid accumulation of nadph in the chloroplasts, leading to the over-reduction of the psi acceptor side. furthermore, the restriction of the photosynthetic linear electron flow due to the inhibition of the aox pathway inevitably limited the generation of the thylakoid Δph, which thus limited the de-epoxidation of violaxanthin and further suppressed the induction of npq . therefore, the mitochondrial aox pathway protects the photosynthetic apparatus against photodamage by alleviating the over-reduction of the psi acceptor side and accelerating the induction of npq.
