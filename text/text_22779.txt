BACKGROUND
micrornas  are short non-coding rna molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally
 <cit> . mirnas are transcribed by rna polymerase ii. primary transcripts of mirnas are cleaved in the nucleus by the nuclease drosha to generate precursor mirnas  with a characteristic hairpin-like secondary structure
 <cit> . the pre-mirnas are then exported to the cytoplasm and further cleaved by the rnase iii enzyme dicer to release a 21– <dig> nt small rna duplex from the stem region of the hairpins
 <cit> . in most cases, only one strand of the small rna duplex is retained as mature mirna, and the other strand, termed mirna star , is degraded
 <cit> . in some cases, however, both strands from the same hairpin are retained as functional mirnas, which are annotated as mirna-5p and mirna-3p, respectively, depending on which arm of the hairpin they are derived
 <cit> . sequence variations, such as nucleotide deletion, insertion, untemplated terminal extension, and editing, have been observed for some mirnas
 <cit> . the majority of animal mirnas function by binding to the 3′-untranslated regions  of target mrnas via sequence complementarity to induce mrna degradation or repress protein translation
 <cit> . mirnas have been found in most eukaryotes and many of them are conserved through evolution. the recent application of deep sequencing technology has also revealed an increasing number of species-specific mirnas
 <cit> . it is estimated that over 60% of human protein-coding genes might be regulated by mirnas
 <cit> . by fine-tuning gene expression, mirnas regulate many biological processes ranging from cell proliferation, cell fate specification, cell differentiation, apoptosis, animal development, metabolism, to various disease conditions
 <cit> .

the zebra finch , an oscine songbird, provides a unique animal model for neurobiological research with its characteristic learned vocal behavior
 <cit> . zebra finches use a discrete set of interconnected brain nuclei and pathways, commonly referred to as the song system, to control song behavior
 <cit> . song behavior in zebra finches is sexually dimorphic: only male birds sing, and the song system is highly developed in males
 <cit> . for decades, zebra finches have been widely used to study vocal learning, neuronal replacement, and sexually dimorphic development of male and female brains
 <cit> . in recent years, large efforts have been devoted to developing genomic resources and extending research in zebra finches to molecular and genomics levels
 <cit> . as part of this effort, we have systematically characterized mirna expression in various tissues of adult female and male zebra finches using the illumina high throughput sequencing platform. taking advantage of the large sequence dataset now available, we analyzed features of these mirnas, including mirna sequence conservation through evolution, mirna clusters, tissue-enriched expression, and sequence variations. previously, using the  <dig> sequencing platform, we detected a z chromosome encoded mirna, mir- <dig>  in the male zebra finch brain
 <cit> . this mirna has recently been shown to be expressed in the auditory forebrain of zebra finches, and its expression is regulated by song exposure
 <cit> . we have further explored the expression of mir- <dig> and other z chromosome encoded mirnas in male and female tissues and have found that mir- <dig> is predominantly expressed in all male tissues examined. our target prediction analysis revealed that mir- <dig>  but not other z chromosome encoded mirnas, preferentially targets z chromosome encoded genes.

RESULTS
general features of zebra finch mirnas
we prepared eight small rna libraries from four tissues – brain, heart, liver, and muscle – of adult female and male zebra finches. these libraries were sequenced using the illumina genome analyzer ii high throughput sequencing platform. we obtained a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw sequence reads from all libraries combined. after adaptor trimming and removal of low quality reads and orphan sequences ,  <dig> , <dig> high quality sequence reads were retained for subsequent analysis . of these reads, 60% mapped perfectly to the zebra finch genome assembly . we extracted flanking sequences around mapped reads and used mfold
 <cit>  to search for hairpin-like secondary structures. a total of  <dig> mature mirnas were identified, which exhibited good hairpin-like precursor structures and matched known mirnas recorded in mirbase  with high sequence homology . considering that the current zebra finch genome assembly is relatively new and may contain gaps
 <cit> , we compared the unmapped sequence reads to known mirna sequences in mirbase, and identified  <dig> additional mirnas with high sequence homology  to known mirnas in other species. following the general criteria for mirna annotation
 <cit> , we identified three novel zebra finch specific mirna candidates, which are supported by good hairpin-like precursor structures, presence of corresponding star sequences, and relatively high expression . taken together, we identified  <dig> distinct zebra finch mirnas. the sequences, genomic locations, and relative expression levels of these mirnas are summarized in additional file
 <dig> 

mirnas and their variants accounted for ~64% of all high quality reads. the remaining sequence reads were classified as rrna/trna fragments, repeat-associated small rnas, degradation products of mrnas, and undefined small rnas . the expression levels of individual mirnas spanned a wide range, from a few copies to thousands of copies . for example, tgu-mir- <dig>  which was highly expressed in both heart and muscle, was represented by  <dig> , <dig> reads, accounting for 25% of the total mirna reads , whereas the three novel zebra finch mirnas were expressed at relatively low levels, represented by  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> reads respectively . . all of the top  <dig> most abundantly expressed mirnas were conserved in vertebrates, and they comprised 76% of the total mirna sequence reads .

potential avian specific mirnas
by comparing to mature mirna sequences in mirbase,  <dig> of the  <dig> zebra finch mirnas did not have homologs  outside of avian species. to investigate whether these  <dig> mirnas had unidentified homologs in other genomes, we searched for homologous sequences in the genomes of  <dig> animal species including c. elegans, drosophila , zebrafish , x. tropicalis , lizard , platypus , chicken , mouse , and human . sequence homologs of  <dig> mirnas  were found in at least one non-avian vertebrate, and these were subsequently excluded from the list of avian-specific mirnas. thus,  <dig> mirnas were classified as avian-specific mirnas, of which  <dig> were zebra finch specific . by extending this analysis to all the  <dig> zebra finch mirnas, we found that  <dig> mirnas were conserved from c. elegans through humans,  <dig> were conserved in vertebrates, and  <dig> were only conserved between avian and mammals .
 <cit> , and they are already in mirbase, so they were not considered to be novel mirnas.

mirna clusters
using a distance of  <dig> kb between any two mirna genes as a cutoff,  <dig> mirna genes were grouped into  <dig> genomic clusters. we named these mirna gene clusters according to the name of the first member of each cluster followed by the number of mirna genes within the cluster in parenthesis, e.g., cluster tgu-mir- <dig> contains tgu-mir- <dig>  tgu-mir-27b, and tgu-mir-23b . among these clusters,  <dig> appeared to be formed by tandem duplications of a single mirna gene, e.g., the tgu-mir- <dig> cluster on chromosome  <dig> contains  <dig> copies of the tgu-mir- <dig> gene . a majority of clusters were conserved in vertebrates ; one cluster ) was also conserved in d. melanogaster, but none was conserved in c. elegans. one cluster ) appeared to be zebra finch specific.

mirna*
we found  <dig> mirna* sequences for  <dig> mature mirnas . for mirnas encoded by multiple genomic loci, a single mature sequence can have more than one star sequence, presumably originating from different precursors. for example, three different star sequences were detected for tgu-mir- <dig>  which has three genomic loci. these three tgu-mir-7* sequences had different read counts, indicating that the three tgu-mir- <dig> genes were transcribed with different promoter activities and/or different efficacies of precursor processing . most of the star sequences were detected at considerably lower levels compared to their respective dominant strands. yet, for  <dig> mirnas, both strands were detected at comparable levels , suggesting that both strands may function as mature mirnas. the relative read counts for the two strands of these mirnas were similar across the four tissues examined , indicating that the mechanisms retaining both strands were tissue independent. interestingly, for several mirnas , both strands have been detected at similar levels in mice and chickens as well
 <cit> , suggesting a functional conservation of these star sequences in vertebrates.

mirnas generated by atypical biogenesis pathways
mirtrons are a special group of mirnas that are derived from short intronic sequences by splicing machinery rather than by drosha cleavage
 <cit> . recently, glazov and colleagues reported the identification of  <dig> mirtrons in chickens
 <cit> . we did not, however, find sequence homologs of any of the chicken mirtrons in our mirna set, nor did we find any mirnas mapping to either boundaries of a short intron. this discrepancy might be partly explained by the fact that the chicken mirtrons were detected in embryos and exhibited low copy numbers
 <cit> , whereas our mirnas were from adult tissues. alternatively, it may simply be a consequence of the incomplete annotation of intronic regions in the zebra finch genome.

mir- <dig> is a vertebrate mirna whose maturation depends on ago <dig> cleavage rather than the common dicer pathway
 <cit> . we found that tgu-mir- <dig> was located on chromosome  <dig>  about  <dig> nt downstream from mir- <dig>  and the mature and precursor sequences of tgu-mir- <dig> were highly conserved with those in chickens, mice, and humans. similar to its mammalian counterparts, the 5′-end of tgu-mir- <dig> was well defined, whereas its 3′-end was highly variable, extending into the loop region of the hairpin structure, presumably reflecting imprecise cleavage by ago <dig> .

mirna expression patterns in tissues
we next examined the expression patterns of zebra finch mirnas in brain, heart, liver, and muscle. overall, the brain displayed the most diverse mirna expression and had the largest number of tissue-enriched mirnas . about 17% of all mirnas  showed enriched expression in a single tissue, and two thirds of them  were highly enriched in brain based on combined read counts from males and females . however, the two most abundantly expressed mirnas  showed little or no expression in brain. since the sequences of many mirnas are conserved through evolution, we asked whether the tissue-enriched mirna expression patterns were also conserved. to this end, we analyzed previously published data from human, mouse, and sea slug  <cit> . seven mirnas  showed brain-enriched expression in both humans and zebra finches, and mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-34b have also been detected in the aplysia nervous system . we validated the conservation of tissue expression patterns of five mirnas in human, mouse, and zebra finch by northern blot analysis .

* √ indicates brain-enriched expression in the examined species.

mirnas within a genomic cluster tend to exhibit parallel relative expression patterns across tissues, probably reflecting their shared promoter and tissue specific cistronic transcriptional control. however, the expression abundance of different members of a cluster in a given tissue can be drastically different. for example, mir-133a and mir- <dig> of the 133a cluster were both expressed in heart and muscle, but the expression of mir- <dig> was about  <dig> times higher than that of mir-133a in each of these tissues. this difference in expression levels between members was characteristic of many genomic clusters , suggesting that a precursor specific event during the mirna maturation process might regulate the expression levels of individual mirnas in a genomic cluster.

sequence variations
taking advantage of the large sequence dataset, we analyzed mirna sequence variations. we classified mirna isoforms into three major groups: length variations, untemplated terminal nucleotide additions, and internal substitutions . the length variants accounted for 25% of the total mirna reads, a majority of which  were 3' variants . this is in good agreement with observations in other species, further supporting the notion that precision at cleavage events at the 5'-termini is necessary to protect the seed sequence at positions 2– <dig> of the mature mirna
 <cit> . nonetheless, the read numbers of 5' offset isoforms of several mirnas were relatively high. for example, mir- <dig>  a brain enriched mirna, had several 5' offset isoforms, with the combined reads accounting for 15% of all reads . another prominent example was mir-133a, which had two main 5'-isoforms, mir-133a <dig> and mir-133a <dig>  of which the 5' terminus of mir-133a <dig> was shifted  <dig> nucleotide in the 3' direction. these two isoforms were each represented by  <dig>  and  <dig>  reads, accounting for 32% and 41% of the total reads. interestingly, similar patterns of 5' heterogeneity are also observed in mouse mir- <dig> and mir-133a
 <cit> , indicating that the alternative processing mechanisms giving raise to these isoforms might be evolutionarily conserved.

untemplated nucleotide additions to mirna 3' ends are observed for many mirnas in worms, flies, and mammals
 <cit> . similar to those observed in other species, nucleotides most frequently added to zebra finch mirnas were u and a, with the u additions occurring more frequently than the a additions . for some mirnas, the extended isoforms outnumbered the canonical forms. for example, mir- <dig> had  <dig> fold more extended reads than non-extended reads, and mir- <dig> had  <dig>  extended reads compared to  <dig>  non-extended reads . we also observed that a addition had a greater tendency to occur on 5p arms, occurring  <dig> times on 5p arms compared to  <dig> on 3p arms, while u addition occurred slightly more often on 3p arms, occurring  <dig> times on 3p arms compared to  <dig> on 5p arms. compared with previously published data, it appeared that patterns of untemplated extension of some mirnas were conserved among multiple vertebrate species. for example, the a extensions of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> and the u extensions of mir-15a, mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  mir- <dig>  and mir-425-5p were observed in zebra finch, human, and mouse
 <cit> .

in mammals, mirna editing events in which adenosine is converted to inosine by adenosine deaminases  are observed for several mirnas; the resultant inosine is detected in sequencing as an a-to-g conversion
 <cit> . among our data, however, the a-to-g change was found in just ~ <dig> % of total mirna reads in the brain library and in all  <dig> libraries combined. this frequency does not differ significantly from the sequencing error rate observed among our synthetic internal control sequences spiked into library preparations . we also searched for a-to-i editing events at specific sites in individual mirnas. using a criterion of >5% mismatch frequency, only tgu-mir- <dig> exhibited significant a-to-g change at the 15th position of the mature sequence. this change occurred in all tissues, but had the highest frequency in brain . we next examined all mirnas that had any internal nucleotide change. thirty-two mirnas displayed internal nucleotide changes with a frequency >5%. nucleotide changes at the u position within a ggu motif were the most frequent substitution , and it appeared that substitution with any of the other three nucleotides was permissible . for several mirnas in this group, the ggu motifs occurred within the seed sequence ; thus, substitution of the u nucleotide could potentially alter mirna targeting specificity .

*the seed regions  are underlined. the ggu motifs are marked in boldface.

male-biased expression and targeting of mir-2954
mir- <dig> is a recently identified avian mirna, which has a single genomic locus on the zebra finch z chromosome
 <cit> . we did not detect it in the chicken genome assembly  or in the genomes of other animal species . however, we found the mature mir- <dig> sequence among chicken ests, and its expression in chicken embryo is detected by northern blot analysis
 <cit> . tgu-mir- <dig> was expressed in a sex-biased manner in all four examined tissues; and its expression was significantly higher in male tissues than in female tissues . we validated this expression pattern by northern blot analysis and quantitative real-time pcr  . our original sequencing samples did not include ovary and testis; however, using qrt-pcr, we found that the expression of mir- <dig> was 3-fold higher in testis than in ovary . in addition to mir- <dig>  six other mirnas  were encoded solely by the z chromosome, and most of them showed slightly higher expression in male tissues than in female tissues . the one exception was mir- <dig>  which was expressed at a higher level in heart in females than in males. several mirnas  that are encoded by both the z and the a chromosomes did not exhibit consistent sex-biased expression .

we next performed target prediction analysis using the targetscan software package
 <cit> . target analysis predicted approximately  <dig> putative tgu-mir- <dig> target genes, with a strong bias towards z chromosome-encoded genes  . a similar pattern was also observed for chicken mir- <dig>  for which  <dig> of the  <dig> putative targets were z chromosome encoded  , suggesting that the functional preference of mir- <dig> for z-linked genes is conserved among avians. a significantly larger number of mir- <dig> target genes were predicted in chickens  than in zebra finches, probably reflecting the incomplete annotation of the 3'-utr sequences in the current zebra finch genome assembly . in contrast, no enrichment of z chromosome-encoded target genes was found for other zebra finch z chromosome-encoded mirnas such as mir-27b and mir- <dig> . among the putative tgu-mir- <dig> targets were several z-linked genes encoding proteins with particular functions in the nervous system, including ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase iv , scamp <dig>  and smarca <dig>  genes encoding proteins in the guanine nucleotide exchange signaling pathways  were prominently represented as well. in addition, many putative mir- <dig> targets were key regulators of transcription, including tle <dig>  gpbp <dig>  psip <dig>  smarca <dig>  hmgb <dig>  tnip <dig>  zcchc <dig>  eapp, rqcd <dig>  mlf <dig>  stat <dig>  atf <dig>  ezh <dig>  and dedd .

discussion
here we report a comprehensive annotation and analysis of  <dig> zebra finch mirnas expressed in four different tissues of both sexes. while the majority of the  <dig> identified mirnas are evolutionarily conserved, relatively large fractions of them are zebra finch-specific  or avian-specific . the list of zebra finch specific mirnas may be even longer, as approximately 40% of the total sequence reads obtained from our small rna libraries failed to map to the genome, probably due to gaps in the current genome assembly. conversely, genomes of other species that we searched may have gaps as well, thus we cannot rule out the possibility that some avian and/or zebra finch specific mirnas described here may have undiscovered homologs in other species. several zebra finch specific mirnas showed tissue specific expression. for example, mir- <dig> was detected in the brain, mir- <dig> in liver, and the novel mirna  <dig> in heart . however, most of the zebra finch specific mirnas were expressed at low levels, indicating that their expression is restricted to specific cell types or that they have not yet been widely incorporated into gene regulation networks. further investigation will be needed to determine if these avian or zebra finch specific mirnas play roles in zebra finch specific features.

recently, gunaratne et al. reported the annotation of  <dig> mirnas expressed in the auditory forebrain region of zebra finches
 <cit> . among these mirnas,  <dig> are present in our set of mirnas. our dataset contains an additional  <dig> mirnas, many of which show tissue specific expression in heart, liver, and muscle . this is not unexpected as we sequenced four tissues, whereas only auditory forebrain was sequenced by gunaratne et al. although the source materials used in the two studies were different and the criteria for mirna annotation were slightly different, the large overlap between the two datasets provides additional confidence with respect to the identification of these mirnas. combining the two sets of data brings the total number of zebra finch mirnas to  <dig>  many of these mirnas show enriched expression in the brain, including several  that are regulated in the auditory forebrain by song exposure
 <cit> , indicating that mirnas may play important roles in song behavior and neural plasticity.

mirna sequence heterogeneity
we did not observe significant a-to-i editing in mature zebra finch mirnas except for mir- <dig>  notably, several mammalian mirnas with well-characterized a-to-i editing sites  do not appear to have homologs in zebra finches, hinting that a-to-i editing might be more restricted to mammals. instead, we observed internal nucleotide changes at the uridine of a ggu motif occurring at a relative high frequency. our average base call sequencing error rate was < <dig> % , comparable to sequencing error rates observed by others
 <cit> . the rate of observed nucleotide changes at the ggu motif was as high as 14% . thus it is unlikely that these changes were due to sequencing errors. we also examined each genomic locus for mirnas known to have multiple genomic loci, and ruled out the possibility that they were due to genetic variations. we cannot rule out the possibility that these changes were due to single nucleotide polymorphisms , as we currently know very little about snps in zebra finches. however, we would expect that the rate of nucleotide changes generated by snps would be much higher than we observed. to our knowledge, internal nucleotide changes at the uridine of a ggu motif has not been reported previously. some of the ggu motifs are within seed sequences of mature mirnas . nucleotide changes at these sites can change mirna binding specificity, and subsequently, impact gene expression and related cellular processes. further analysis will bring better understandings of biosynthesis mechanisms and potential biological functions of this type of internal nucleotide change.

other types of sequence heterogeneity including untemplated 3' terminal extensions and length variations are far more prevalent than internal nucleotide changes. mirna isoforms with 3' untemplated extensions account for ~15% of all mirna reads. mirna 3' untemplated a or u extensions have been widely reported by others in multiple animal species
 <cit> . these events seem to be mirna specific, as some mirnas are more frequently extended than others. interestingly, many of the zebra finch mirnas showing high frequencies of 3' untemplated extensions are also frequently extended in other species , hinting that mechanisms governing the extension events and their potential functions are likely to be conserved. although investigation of 3' untemplated extension is still at an early stage, 3' extension appears to be biologically regulated
 <cit>  and to affect biological function. emerging evidence suggests that 3' untemplated extensions provide a post-transcriptional mechanism to regulate mirna stability and efficiency of target repression
 <cit> .

mir- <dig> as a sex specific gene regulator in avian species
despite extensive searching, we did not find sequence homologs of mir- <dig> outside of the avian taxon. an extensive search among transcripts of crocodile and  <dig> bird species conducted by gunaratne et al. found mir- <dig> in several bird species but not in crocodile
 <cit> . given that the genomes and transcriptomes searched in these studies are not complete, we cannot rule out the possibility that mir- <dig> has as yet unidentified homologs in other species. however, its expression in chickens and zebra finches is now supported by three independent studies including ours
 <cit> . the male-biased expression of mir- <dig> in chicken embryos
 <cit>  and in various zebra finch tissues suggests that it plays a role in sexually dimorphic animal development and function in avian species.

animals adapt different dosage compensation mechanisms to balance the expression of sex chromosome genes between the two sexes and to balance the expression between sex chromosomal genes and autosomal genes
 <cit> . in avian species, females are heterogametic with one z and one w chromosome, and males are homogametic with two z chromosomes. both the chicken and zebra finch lack a chromosome-wide dosage compensation mechanism, and many z chromosome genes exhibit higher expression in males than in females
 <cit> . while the male to female  expression ratios of most z-linked mirnas are close to  <dig>  reflecting the copy number relationship, mir- <dig> exhibits m:f expression ratios ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  or  <dig> to  <dig>  in various tissues, which cannot be explained by the 2: <dig> difference in gene copy numbers. clearly, additional male-biased factors contribute to the regulation of mir- <dig> expression in various tissues.

in both chickens and zebra finches, dosage compensation can occur locally in a gene-specific manner
 <cit> . in chickens, this is exemplified by dosage compensation mediated by the mhm  locus on nearby genes on the z chromosome
 <cit> . however, the zebra finch genome does not appear to contain the mhm locus
 <cit> , suggesting the existence of other sex specific dosage compensation mechanisms. the male-biased expression of mir- <dig> and its preferential targeting of z-chromosome genes may provide a novel dosage compensation mechanism at the post-transcriptional level. a mirna-mediated gene-specific mechanism for sex chromosome gene regulation would offer flexibility in response to specific developmental and functional needs.

both song behavior and the underlying neural circuit are highly sexually dimorphic in zebra finches. the song system nuclei hvc
 <cit>  and the robust nucleus of the arcopallium , which control motor patterns of song, are considerably larger in males than in females, and area-x, a forebrain nucleus required for song learning, is a large nucleus in adult males but is almost invisible in adult females
 <cit> . the gene regulation network underlying this structural and functional sexual dimorphism is not clear. among the putative targets of mir- <dig>  scamp <dig>  a z chromosome encoded synaptic vesicle associated protein gene, is known to be expressed at higher levels in hvc and ra in male zebra finches than in females
 <cit> . recently, gunaratne et al. reported that mir- <dig> is regulated by hearing songs in the auditory forebrain of zebra finches
 <cit> , suggesting that in the context of song behavior this mirna plays important roles in relaying physiological changes to changes in gene expression. further analysis of mir- <dig> expression in the song control circuits, and validation of its target genes will provide a better understanding of its roles in the sexually dimorphic structural and functional development of the zebra finch brain.

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide a comprehensive mirna expression atlas of brain, heart, liver, and muscle tissues of both male and female zebra finches. these data significantly enlarge the zebra finch mirna repertoire, and will serve as a valuable resource for comparative and functional studies for the scientific community. in addition, we report a ggu motif as a potential site for mirna internal substitution. we also describe male-biased expression of tgu-mir- <dig>  as well as its z chromosome biased target relationship, which may point to a novel avian specific dosage compensation mechanism.
