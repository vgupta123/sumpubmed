BACKGROUND
analyzing how mammalian genomes are organized and how chromosomal rearrangements are involved in speciation and macroevolution are fundamental to understanding the dynamics of mammalian chromosomal evolution. phylogenetic analysis of both nuclear and mitochondrial dna  <cit> , among others, as well as the insertion sites of multiple long interspersed elements  and long terminal repeats , all support the division of extant placental mammals into four major clades. these are laurasiatheria and supraprimates that together form boreoeutheria , and xenarthra and afrotheria which have a gondwanan  genesis, although this biogeographic hypothesis is not without detractors  <cit> . although afrotheria is usually depicted as basal in sequence based phylogenies, the first divergence in the placental tree has been a matter of concern for some time. for example, some argue  <cit>  for a basal xenarthra  on insertion sites of retroposed elements , while data from  <dig> genes encompassing  <dig> kb of sequence resulted in a highly supported phylogeny that places the root between afrotheria and other placentalia  <cit> , consistent with the basal afrotheria or exafroplacentalia hypothesis  <cit> . most recently, however, xenarthra and afrotheria have been placed on a common basal branch , to the exclusion of boreoeutheria  <cit> .

afrotheria, the focus of our study, includes six mammalian orders all with an afro-arabian origin that exhibit extreme morphogical diversity and niche preference thought to result from the long period of isolation when africa was an island continent 105- <dig> mya  <cit> . the six orders are proboscidea , sirenia , hyracoidea , tubulidentata , macroscelidea  and afrosoricida . in cases where the analysis of primary sequences generates ambiguous phylogenetic results, "rare genomic changes"  such as indels, lines, sines and chromosomal rearrangements have been widely viewed as markers that could, given their low levels of homoplasy, provide additional resolution to seemingly intractable phylogenetic problems . so far, afrotherian monophyly is supported by a suite of sequence-based characters that include a  <dig> bp deletion in exon  <dig> of the brca <dig> gene  <cit> , 5' and 3' deletions in exon  <dig> of apolipoprotein b  <cit> , the presence of a unique family of sines , long interspersed elements  and long terminal repeat  elements  <cit> . consistent with the view that chromosomal rearrangements are similarly rarely homoplasious, and therefore robust indicators of evolutionary change , it comes as no surprise that in addition to providing evidence in support of the uniqueness of afrotheria, chromosomal syntenies have also proved useful for clarifying the phylogenetic relationships within the group  <cit> .

one of the most important features of mammalian chromosomal evolution is the suggestion of a non-random distribution of regions implicated in evolutionary chromosomal reorganization, the so-called "fragile-breakage" hypothesis  <cit> . related to this, recent experimental data have demonstrated a correlation between the location of fragile sites and evolutionary breakpoints  <cit>  suggesting that these unstable regions could be one of many factors implicated in the evolutionary process. at the cytogenetic level, fragile sites are expressed as non-stained gaps and breaks when cells are cultured under specific conditions  <cit> . in general, fragile sites can be expressed by agents such as aphidicolin, brdu and 5-azacytidine among others, which delay or inhibit dna replication or repair  <cit> . according to their frequency in the human population, as well as their mechanisms of expression, fragile sites have been conventionally classified into two groups: common and rare  <cit> . common fragile sites in particular have been studied in different mammalian species confirming the initial hypothesis that they are structural characteristics of mammalian chromosomes  <cit> . common fragile sites have been expressed in rodents  <cit> , pig and cow  <cit> , horse  <cit> , cat  <cit> , dog  <cit>  and different primate species  <cit> . however, in all instances the species studied group within laurasiatheria and supraprimates, the most distant relatives of xenarthra and afrotheria that are thought to have diverged ~ <dig> mya  <cit> . there is, at this point, no comparable data for the deeper divergences such as the afrotheria whose separation from boreoeutheria and xenarthra is estimated at ~ <dig> mya  <cit> .

in an attempt to test if there are loci with a high tendency to break and reorganize in the afrotheria, and whether these are coincidental with evolutionary breakpoints, we have analyzed the expression of aphidicolin-induced common fragile sites in fibroblast cultures from different specimens of three afrotherian species. these are the aardvark , golden mole  and elephant-shrew . given the position of afrotheria near the root of placentalia , the analysis of chromosomal instability in these species provides a unique opportunity to further our understanding of the mechanisms underpinning mammalian chromosomal evolution.

for each data set, the fsm program used in our analysis of fragile sites provides a critical value  that indicates the minimum number of breaks needed for a chromosomal band to be considered fragile. this value was ≥ <dig> for aardvark cultures treated with  <dig>  μm aphidicolin. the number of fragile sites detected ranged from  <dig> in oaf specimen  <dig> to  <dig> in oaf specimen  <dig>  given the intraspecific variability of fragile site expression in mammalian species, we combined all expressed sites into a single species-specific analysis . on this basis, a total of  <dig> sites were considered fragile in the aardvark  showing that there are regions in this species' genome that are prone to breakage under specific culture conditions; of these, six were expressed in both aardvark specimens .

 chrysochloris asiatica
a total of  <dig> metaphase spreads were analysed from the three specimens included in our investigation:  <dig> cells from cultures treated with  <dig>  μm apc, and  <dig> from control cultures . cells treated with aphidicolin presented the highest number of chromosomal aberrations  reflecting a 10-fold increase with respect to the control cultures. a total of  <dig> chromosomal abnormalities were detected of which chromatid breaks were the most frequent class of aberration encountered in this species .

analysis of the aphidicolin induced aberrations using the fsm program indicate that chromosomal bands characterised by ≥ <dig> or ≥ <dig> abnormalities per band  could be considered fragile. using these values, a total of  <dig> fragile sites were detected in the golden mole genome , with the number of fragile sites ranging from  <dig> in cas specimen  <dig>  to  <dig> in cas specimen  <dig> . eight of the fragile sites  were found to be expressed in all three specimens examined .

 elephantulus edwardii
a total of  <dig> metaphase spreads were analysed in the four specimens of this species of which  <dig> were from cultures treated with  <dig>  μm apc, and  <dig> from control cultures . we detected  <dig> chromosomal abnormalities of which chromatid breaks were the most frequent class of aberration scored .

mirroring the results in the golden mole, the critical value generated by the fsm program for the elephant shrew was ≥ <dig> or, depending on the specimen studied, ≥ <dig> chromosomal abnormalities per band. the number of fragile sites detected ranged from  <dig> in eed specimen  <dig> to  <dig> in eed specimen  <dig> ; in total  <dig> sites were considered fragile in the elephant-shrew genome . only three of these  are expressed in all four specimens studied .

distribution of evolutionary breakpoints and conservation of fragile sites
we plotted all human chromosomal homologies previously described in  <cit>  and  <cit>  onto the ideogram of each of the afrotherian species studied so as to identify bands that delimit human syntenic blocks. using this approach we identified a set of evolutionary chromosomal bands that correspond to junctions defining human chromosomal syntenies in the three afrotherian species studied herein. these are:  aardvark – 1p <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  3q <dig>  4q <dig>  4q <dig>  5q <dig>  6q <dig> and 6q <dig>   golden mole – 1q <dig>  1q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  3q <dig>  4p <dig>  4q <dig>  4q <dig>  6q <dig>  9q <dig>  11p <dig> and 11p <dig> and  cape rock elephant shrew – 1p <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  4q <dig>  4q <dig>  5q <dig>  5q <dig>  7q <dig>  10q <dig>  11p <dig> and 11q <dig> . additionally, we were able to plot the african elephant/aardvark chromosomal syntenies described in  <cit>  that are based on reciprocal painting of these two species thereby providing insights into the association between evolutionary breakpoints and fragile sites among these two species compared to the older, phylogenetically more distant human/afrotheria evolutionary comparison. nineteen evolutionary chromosomal bands were detected when comparing the aardvark and african elephant genomes: 1p <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  1q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  2q <dig>  3q <dig>  3q <dig>  4p <dig>  5q <dig> and 6q <dig> . on combining these data   <dig> distinct evolutionary breakpoints could be defined in the aardvark; of these, six are common to both data sets .

given these findings, we proceeded to determine if there is a correlation between the position of evolutionary breakpoints and the location of fragile sites in each of the afrotherian species studied using contingency analysis. of the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints identified in the aardvark by reciprocal painting with human painting probes  <cit> , seven are coincidental with regions of fragility as defined by fragile site location  . of the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints identified in the aardvark by reciprocal painting with the african elephant painting probes  <cit> , eight are coincidental with regions of fragility  . it is noteworthy that of the six bands  that delimit human and elephant chromosomal syntenic blocks in the aardvark genome , all but one  express fragile sites. additionally,  <dig> fragile sites were expressed in the golden mole of which four  show correspondence with the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints detected by chromosome painting . of the  <dig> aphidicolin induced fragile sites in the elephant shrew, six   were coincidental with the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints previously identified in this species using human chromosome painting probes  <cit> .

we conducted a more refined analysis of the afrotherian fragile sites by comparing those that are  expressed in a single species , and  those fragile sites conserved between two or more species . as above, we assessed each category of fragile site for correspondence with evolutionary breakpoints. our aim was to test if conserved fragile sites, which are more likely to be ancient fragile sites, might show an enrichment of evolutionary breakpoints. this was borne out by the data which show that of the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints identified in the aardvark by reciprocal painting with human painting probes  <cit> , three are coincidental with aardvark-specific fragile sites  and four are coincidental with conserved fragile sites . similarly, a significant association was found in the elephant shrew . however, in the case of the golden mole, the tendency was not significant. these data suggest, therefore, that evolutionary breakpoints tend to concentrate more frequently in conserved fragile sites than in those that are species-specific, although only significantly so in two of the three species analysed. finally, three conserved fragile sites were shared between all three afrotherian species . one of these  was coincidental with the site of an evolutionary breakpoint in all three species – that corresponding to hsa 2/ <dig>  the only chromosomal synteny which strongly supports the afroinsectiphillia  to the exclusion of the elephant  <cit> ).

discussion
fragile sites and chromosomal evolution
this investigation confirms and extends earlier observations that fragile sites form part of the chromosomal structure in mammals, and that the characteristics underlying their susceptibility to breakage have been conserved during evolution  <cit> . using data from fragile site expression, g-banding analysis, and cross-species chromosome painting, we have identified fragile sites in aardvark, golden mole and elephant-shrew  that are located in homologous chromosomal positions in these species. we detected  <dig> conserved fragile sites in aardvark genome, eight in golden mole, and  <dig> fragile sites in the elephant-shrew . fragile sites detected in more than one species were regarded as "conserved fragile sites" in order to distinguish them from those that were species-specific.

although fragile sites have been considered "hot spots" for evolutionary reorganization in a variety of mammalian species , the data are limited to a single clade, boreoeutheria  <cit> . this begs the question whether this fragility is a more general phenomenon in mammals, and whether the evolutionary breakpoints that characterise human syntenies detected in the basal afrotheria similarly correspond at the chromosomal band level with fragile sites detected in other species when using a chemical challenge. twenty nine fragile sites were detected in aardvark,  <dig> in golden mole and  <dig> in the elephant-shrew . a contingency analysis shows that there is a significant association for bands that contain evolutionary breakpoints to accumulate fragile sites in the aardvark , as well as in the cape rock elephant shrew  genomes. the association was not statistically significant in the golden mole, but there is, nonetheless, a tendency for bands that contain evolutionary breakpoints to accumulate fragile sites in this species .

the inclusion of the elephant/aardvark chromosome painting data into the analysis offered an opportunity to compare old  and phylogenetically younger evolutionary breakpoints  and their correlation with chromosomal fragility. we reasoned that younger breakpoints may show a greater correlation with afrotherian fragile sites than their more ancient counterparts identified in the human vs. afrotherian comparisons. the analysis, however, did not reveal marked differences between the two types of evolutionary breakpoints. when the human chromosomal homologies are plotted against the aardvark genome, seven of the  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints co-localize with fragile sites . plotting the elephant chromosomal homologies to the aardvark genome revealed that eight of  <dig> evolutionary breakpoints co-localize with fragile sites  indicating that the mechanism causing the fragility is conserved. given these findings, we then proceeded to determine whether the data inform previous conclusions on chromosomal syntenies thought to underpin the recognition of afrotheria as one of the four major supraordinal clades of placental mammals .

chromosomal signatures in afrotheria
the recognition of a monophyletic afrotherian clade was initially based on dna sequence comparisons  <cit>  and subsequently supported by the analysis of large concatenations of nuclear and mitochondrial genes  <cit> , unique insertion and deletion events   <cit> , comparative cytogenetic studies  <cit> , morphology  <cit> , placentation  <cit>  and, most recently, by whole genome assemblies  <cit> . given that afrotheria is thought to be near the root of the eutherian tree, the organization of their genomes could provide unique insights into the dynamics of mammalian chromosomal evolution.

two human syntenies have been proposed by chromosome painting studies to link afrotherians to the exclusion of other placental mammals . in terms of the former, it is noteworthy that hsa 1/ <dig> has been reported in a xenarthran species , the insectivore shrew-hedgehog , the pig  <cit> , as well as in the prosimians galago moholi, otolemur crassicaudatus and nycticebus coucang  <cit> , the new world monkeys saimiri sciureus  <cit>  and callicebus lugens  <cit> , and the old world monkeys presbytis cristata  <cit> , pygathrix nemaeus  <cit> , nasalis larvatus  <cit> , trachypithecus francoisi  <cit>  and t. phayrei  <cit> . however, only three of these studies relied on reciprocal chromosomal painting  <cit>  with a fourth  <cit>  based on unidirectional painting, but complemented by comparative gene mapping . these data are a prerequisite for allowing unequivocal identification of the chromosomal arms  involved in the 1/ <dig> syntenies. of these, g. moholi and n. coucang  <cit>  show an hsa 1q/19q association and the pig hsa 1p/19q  <cit> . in contrast, the african elephant and the aardvark share hsa 1/19p  <cit>  begging more detailed analysis of whether 1/19p is truly an afrotherian specific chromosomal signature .

by computationally scanning the genomic assemblies of human and opossum  we sought to validate the hsa 1/19p synteny as a lineage specific, rare genomic change underpinning the monophyly of afrotheria. in attempting to address this it is important to point out that the defining character in a conserved segmental association is the presence of the breakpoint  since, as has been noted elsewhere  <cit> , the size of segments may be altered by subsequent translocations to other regions in the genome, and fish provides no insight to gene order within the syntenic block which may be altered by intrachromosomal rearrangement. furthermore, in deciding the most parsimonious pathway to derive a specific chromosomal rearrangement we follow  <cit>  in viewing the independent disruption of a syntenic group to be more likely than the same adjacent synteny being independently reassembled in different lineages. while the opossum genome shows a hsa 1p/19q/1p/19q/1p/19q/1p association on its chromosome  <dig> , this adjacent synteny is different to the hsa 1q/19q found in the prosimian species g. moholi and n. coucang  further reinforcing the finding that hsa  <dig>  reportedly the largest physical unit in the eutherian ancestral genome, has suffered multiple independent fissions  <cit> .

importantly, however, and of substantial phylogenetic significance, the human chromosomal segment involved in the hsa 1/19p afrotherian synteny is currently ambiguous since the painting data do not allow inference on whether the junction is between hsa 1q or hsa 1p in those species for which there are reciprocal painting data . g-banding homology on the other hand favours hsa 1p/19p . if correct, this association would support the monophyly of afrotheria  <cit>  on current information. however, should further analysis reveal its presence in xenarthra, this would give credence to the recognition of atlantogenata  <cit> , a clade containing afrotheria and xenarthra to the exclusion of boreoeutheria  <cit> . both outcomes underscore the importance of resolving this critical chromosomal synteny for clarifying deep divergences in the eutherian tree although recent strong support for a sister group relationship for afrotheria and xenarthra , clearly tips the odds in favour of hsa 1/19p being a shared synteny for atlantogenata  <cit> .

moreover, it is of interest that the human syntenies hsa  <dig>  hsa 16q/19q and hsa 19p have all previously been proposed for the boreoeutherian ancestor  <cit>  which, if present in the eutherian ancestor, would require a fusion  to derive the hsa 1/19p synteny that possibly unites afrotheria to the exclusion of other placentalia . if the same syntenies were present at the therian root all that would be required is a breakpoint in hsa19q with a fusion to hsa <dig> to give the opossum hsa 1p/19q and hsa <dig> 6q/19q combinations .

using a similar approach we examined the second synteny thought to underpin afrotheria monophyly, hsa 3/21/ <dig>  it was previously argued  <cit>  that the ancestral association hsa 3/ <dig>  <cit>  should be expanded to include segments homologous to human chromosome  <dig> forming an hsa 3/21/ <dig> segmental combination defining afrotheria. the authors posit that the most parsimonious explanation for the observed patterns is that hsa  <dig> appears to have fissioned within paenungulata; in this regard it is noteworthy that 2q <dig> is expressed as a fragile site in aardvark , perhaps indicating an ancestral locus. their reasoning was that the hsa 3/21/ <dig> configuration is present in aardvark, golden mole and elephant-shrew with all three chromosomes retained as intact, conserved entities in the two former species. in the case of the elephant, the fissioning of hsa  <dig> gave rise to hsa 5/ <dig>  and hsa 1/3/21/ <dig> on laf  <dig> . this rearrangement  was recently confirmed  <cit>  in manatee and elephant  by reciprocal painting with paenungulate species-specific painting probes, and through inferences made from human and aardvark  <cit> . new information on the florida manatee  resulting from unidirectional painting experiments with human probes similarly show hsa 5/ <dig> on tma  <dig>  and hsa 2/3/ <dig> on tma  <dig> 

the widely accepted boreutherian ancestral syntenies  are all in the opossum genome suggesting their presence in a therian ancestor, and retention for > <dig> mya . one further ancestral synteny  deserves special comment, especially with respect to its importance for afrotheria. froenicke  <cit>  provided evidence that neighbouring segments homologous to hsa  <dig> and hsa  <dig> have been found in all eutherian orders for which there is information, and that the combined analysis of reciprocal chromosome painting data in conjunction with draft genome sequence information for mouse and human showed that the breakpoint is located in hsa 3p, the region closest to the centromere of this chromosome. while there is no evidence of this synteny in opossum, electronic screening of the chicken genome assembly indicates its retention in this species . opossum has a 21/xp/3q/xp/3q synteny in chromosome  <dig> and, importantly, 3p/3q/xp in chromosome  <dig> indicating different breakpoints in marsupialia . in summary therefore, it would seem that hsa 3p/ <dig> was present in the common ancestor of amniota  supporting its identification as an ancestral synteny that was present > <dig> mya  <cit> , but which was disrupted in the lineage leading to the marsupials. the expansion to include hsa  <dig> in the afrotherian ancestor is unique  <cit>  and defines the monophyly of this ancient african clade of mammals.

CONCLUSIONS
using data from fragile site expression, g-banding analysis, and cross-species chromosome painting, we have described a suite of afrotherian common fragile sites that are correlated with evolutionary breakpoints when compared to the human genome. by computationally scanning the newly released opossum and chicken genomes as outgroups to placentalia, we have shown that the primitive hsa 3p/ <dig> synteny was present in the amniote ancestor, and its expansion to include hsa  <dig> validates the hsa 3/21/ <dig> synteny as a robust cytogenetic signature that defines the monophyly of afrotheria. its fission into two segments  is probably shared by all paenungulata and may have been facilitated by an ancient fragile site that is still expressed in aardvark. further, if the human syntenies hsa  <dig>  hsa 16q/19q and hsa 19p  were present at the eutherian root, a single fusion  would be required to derive the hsa 1/19p synteny that may, with further refined analysis, be found to unite afrotheria to the exclusion of other placentalia.
