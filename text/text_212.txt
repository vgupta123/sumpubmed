BACKGROUND
recent developments in genome-wide data collection have enabled researchers to construct world-wide patterns of ancestry and admixture in domesticated cattle  <cit> . whilst these studies provide an exceptional overview of diversity patterns, smaller sub-populations that are just on the verge of becoming a distinct new breed were not included. genetic differentiation usually takes places when individuals of a population get separated and diverge from each other driven by natural selection, founder effects, genetic drift and the lack of intermixture between the populations. a classic example is darwin’s finches with many different  species inhabiting the multitude of islands in the galapagos, each adapted to the specific environmental conditions of their island  <cit> . a similar scenario can be found in korea, where a large cattle population exists on the mainland , kept for beef production purposes  and therefore undergoing artificial selection pressure  <cit> , and two other cattle populations  inhabiting small areas on the mainland as well as two islands off the coast line. on the mainland, the brown hanwoo dominate mainly due to their incorporation into the national breeding program since the 1970s. on jeju island in the south, black hanwoo  survived, whilst some small populations of brindle or tiger-striped hanwoo  can be found on the mainland and on ulleung island in the east. up until now, these breeds have been treated as independent breeds, mainly due to their different coat colours .

cattle bones found on jeju island were most closely related to jeju black suggesting that the progenitors of these cattle inhabited the island already 1100–2000 years ago  <cit> . this time span coincides with migration routes from north china to japan via the korean peninsula  <cit> . jeju black were used as presents to the king and selected for their black coat colour during the joseon dynasty . in  <dig>  the population was on the brink of extinction and had been reduced to about only  <dig> animals. as a result of conservation efforts, the population of jeju black has increased, though current figures for population size vary widely. most jeju black cattle are kept in two preservation centres on jeju island. in  <dig> the population was designated a natural monument of korea with the hope of drawing attention to the need of improving the lineage and disease control measures, as well as raising awareness about the historical significance of the breed .

first records of chikso cattle can be dated back to a picture on an ancient tomb mural from ad  <dig> . the chikso cattle nowadays comprise about  <dig> animals of which  <dig> exist on the mainland and another  <dig> animals on ulleung island.

both jeju black and chikso were classified as endangered by the national report on the state of animal genetic resources of the republic of korea . however, exact numbers of total or effective population sizes are not recorded and studies on the genetic divergence of the breeds as well as their genetic variability and inbreeding are sparse . maintaining genetic diversity, especially in small populations, is of high importance to prevent a decline in health and fertility and to preserve the ability of a population to respond to environmental changes in the future  <cit> . preservation of jeju black and chikso cattle is of cultural value because of their ancient origins and strong links to the history of korea.

besides the varieties of hanwoo within korea, chinese yanbian cattle have been shown to be genetically highly similar to hanwoo  <cit>  but have maintained a higher level of genetic diversity possibly due to the lack of artificial selection within an organized breeding program. the yanbian region in china has a strong korean influence  <cit>  and the yanbian cattle were probably fully connected to the brown hanwoo until the split between north and south korea in  <dig>  therefore, the yanbian can be seen to some extend as a proxy for the original hanwoo population prior to the implementation of the national breeding scheme.

here, we provide important information  about the state of the jeju black and chikso populations in regards to their genetic variability, state of inbreeding, as well as level of differentiation from the mainland hanwoo population. results of this work should be of value for practical decision making on how to best conserve these populations.

RESULTS
variability and isolation
a breeding program for korean cattle was established as early as the 1930s. in the late 70s selection was intensified and the current breeding objectives were adopted. however, this program only included the mainland brown hanwoo cattle populations. the jeju black and chikso cattle populations were not part of the breeding program and as a result their population sizes decreased. the actual population sizes are unknown and reports differ widely between  <dig> animals to  <dig> animals for the jeju black , jeju special self-governing province community,  <cit> ), and around a total of  <dig> animals for the chikso. despite our sampling of the chikso from the mainland, we will refer to the jeju black and chikso populations from now on as island populations, due to their selective differences and isolation from the brown hanwoo. the mainland brown hanwoo population in comparison comprised  <dig> , <dig> individuals in  <dig> ) and has been on the rise with reported 3 m individuals  <cit> . population size, and more specifically the effective population size , are strongly associated with the genetic variability and the ability of a population to react to environmental changes. to get a better understanding of the size and structure of the korean cattle populations we estimated ne based on the linkage disequilibrium  between the genome-wide markers. the effective population sizes for jeju black and chikso were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, whilst it was  <dig> for the mainland hanwoo . the effective population size for hanwoo is in concordance with previous estimates from lee et al.  <cit> .table  <dig> population metrics of  <dig> cattle breeds including effective population sizes , genetic variance, allelic richness, and inbreeding measures

further, we estimated the effective population size for five european taurine breeds as well as a brahman population which were much lower than previously reported  <cit> . nevertheless, in comparative terms, the two island populations had the smallest effective population size within our study.

the relationship between population size and genetic variability has been extensively studied and with a reduction in population size it would be expected that the genetic variability also decreases and inbreeding increases, which is visible as a loss of heterozygosity  <cit> . a first simplistic measure is to look at the number of markers that are fixed in a population, i.e. show no variability. over all breeds in this study,  <dig>  markers were fixed in at least one population. within the korean cattle breeds, the island populations had  <dig>  to  <dig>  times as many loci fixed compared to the hanwoo, confirming a potential reduction in genetic variability between the korean island and mainland populations . allelic richness  estimates also confirmed a reduction in genetic variability for the two island populations , which were only undercut by the brown swiss and brahman populations of this study. however, observed heterozygosities were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for jeju black and chikso, respectively, and  <dig>  for mainland hanwoo, which were significantly higher than estimated expected heterozygosity levels for these breeds . edea et al.  <cit>  reported a  <dig>  higher expected heterozygosity for hanwoo cattle which might be a result of differing quality control filtering criteria or the use of a lower density genotyping platform, resulting in different estimates of heterozygosity. suh et al.  <cit>  found higher expected heterozygosity levels for brown hanwoo and chikso, however, their study was based on  <dig> microsatellite markers which present a different data basis.

similarly to our observed increased heterozygosity levels compared to expected frequencies, estimated inbreeding coefficients indicated an excess of heterozygous genotypes for the two island populations . variation in inbreeding was similar between chromosomes and showed only stronger deviations from  <dig> for the brown swiss population which is most likely due to the small sample size . even though the indication for an excess in heterozygous loci is marginal, it might point towards an advantage and selection for over-dominant gene expressions  <cit> . selection under environmental pressure can be observed in declining populations because survival or fecundity of heterozygous individuals is increased  <cit> . it was shown that jeju black are more resistant to theileria infections  <cit>  - a piroplasms parasite which causes anorexia, fever, anaemia and icterus -, and hanwoo cattle showed a higher resistance to the bovine papillomavirus compared to holstein cattle  <cit> . nevertheless, reports on different adaption due to environmental pressure within the hanwoo varieties are sparse and do not allow for an in depth interpretation. further, this interpretation warrants some caution as there is a possibility of gene flow between these populations which could also have led to the increased heterozygosity observed. records for chikso and jeju black are very sparse and in an attempt to preserve these populations, there may have been some undocumented crossing with brown hanwoo at some point in time.

to get an indication about whether environmental selection pressure resulted in a higher variability for loci close to genes related to health and fertility traits, we performed a gene enrichment analysis in an area of one mb in either direction of segregating markers that were unique for each korean breed . in total,  <dig> protein coding genes were found in chikso,  <dig> genes in jeju black, and  <dig>  genes in hanwoo cattle.

as expected from the larger number of genes for the hanwoo breed, more gene sets were identified as significantly enriched and mostly just reflect the unbalance in the number of genes in the various processes. thus, most genes were unsurprisingly involved in general processes such as regulation of transcription, proteolysis or cell adhesion . nevertheless, one gene set with  <dig> genes was associated to response to viruses and unique for hanwoo cattle. another gene set consisting of  <dig> genes was associated with defence response to bacteria and unique to jeju black cattle . further, small gene sets unique to jeju black and chikso are involved in immune functions such as beta defensins  <cit> . this provides some evidence that environmental selection pressure may have been exerted on these populations, and thus, possibly led to a higher heterozygosity. further,  <dig> genes unique to the mainland hanwoo were involved in glycerophospholipid metabolism  and  <dig> genes in fat digestion and absorption . these two pathways may be involved in intramuscular fat accumulation which is one of the main breeding goals for brown hanwoo cattle. follow-up studies would be required to verify these suggested genes for their involvement in breed differentiation.table  <dig> biological process of significantly enriched gene sets in the three korean cattle breeds

locus differentiation based on fst values did not yield any significant differences between hanwoo and chikso, or jeju black and chikso which confirms the closeness of these populations. one region on chromosome  <dig> , however, showed a signature of selection between hanwoo and jeju black cattle which included uniquely segregating markers of the hanwoo. this region has not been reported in other studies on selection signatures in hanwoo cattle which might be due to the lower number of markers of this study compared to porto-neto et al.  <cit>  or the novel intra-breed comparison of hanwoo and jeju black. the identified region harbours  <dig> protein coding genes , none of which can be immediately linked to the selection goals or environmental pressures of brown hanwoo cattle.fig.  <dig> marker-wise f

even though the genetic variability of the two island populations is higher than expected and comparable to other cattle populations, a collapse of the island populations in the future could happen due to their small effective population sizes. predicting the development of heterozygosity over the next  <dig> generations, without intervention through conservation programs, showed that the heterozygosity will drop drastically in the future and will halve in  <dig> to  <dig> generations .fig.  <dig> estimated decay of heterozygosity in  <dig> cattle breeds over the next  <dig> generations. solid lines: korean cattle; dashed lines: other breeds



counterintuitively given the population sizes, inbreeding cannot currently be observed in the island populations. however, an excess of heterozygous loci possibly due to environmental selection pressure together with the small effective population sizes warrant close monitoring of the populations to prevent inbreeding depression in the future.

differentiation between populations
the divergence between yanbian and hanwoo is very low and not significant  despite the large geographic area and distance that these cattle inhabit. from a korean production perspective yanbian is of interest because it is an ideal population to provide insights into the effects of the breeding program on the genetic architecture of the hanwoo . yanbian show higher levels of genetic diversity than hanwoo which could be due to the intensive selection on the latter but this is potentially confounded with unaccounted crossing of yanbian with other european breeds – yanbian had lowest fst values with european breeds compared to the other korean breeds .table  <dig> pairwise estimates of f

the level of divergence between the two island populations was higher  compared to the divergence to the mainland hanwoo population at fst  <dig>  and fst  <dig>  , fitting into a classical island model where the two island populations originated from the same mainland population and diverged in different directions over time. the admixture analysis confirmed the separation of the populations showing only spurious influences of indicine in all analysed taurine breeds . the best number of ancestral populations was eight , showing the smallest cross-validation standard error . at eight assumed ancestral populations, five groups were represented by the european taurine and the indicine outgroups . the mainland hanwoo and the chinese yanbian formed one group. matching fst, the jeju black is the first to split from the brown hanwoo to create a partial identity, whilst the chikso is closely linked to hanwoo with almost no jeju black signal . at k =  <dig>  chikso allelic frequencies are separable and there is hardly any overlap between the two island populations; but they both connect back to the mainland hanwoo. this split confirms that the isolation of the island populations forced different trajectories of genetic change. note that the chikso population split into two subgroups; as previously described, the chikso were sampled from two different provinces of south korea and the two subgroups mirror this geographic separation. the brindle coloured population is probably quite heterogeneous between localities with restricted gene flow. conservation measures should take into account that there are pockets of genetic diversity and improve the links between populations to contain further erosion of diversity due to drift or inbreeding.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of  <dig> cattle breeds based on allele frequencies of autosomes with  <dig>  bootstrap replicas



the fst values within the korean cattle populations ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  which is lower than the differences between well characterized european beef  or dairy breeds . the molecular variance explained only  <dig>  % of the variation between the korean populations, whilst among european breeds, ~ <dig>  % of the variation was explained . the divergence between the two island populations is close to the differences between closely related european breeds  but the differentiation from the mainland hanwoo  is not as advanced as between cattle populations that have been classified as different breeds. even though jeju black and chikso are traditionally considered separate breeds from hanwoo, the genetic evidence suggests that breed formation is still in process. whether jeju black and chikso will evolve to become fully distinct breeds or whether they will remain in sisyphean evolution  <cit>  will largely depend on future management decisions.table  <dig> analysis of molecular variance in korean, and european dairy and beef cattle populations

both chikso and particularly the jeju black have a long association with the history of korea – they serve as a living link to the past and to the cultural traditions of the country; hence, there is strong interest in preserving these populations for the future. the effective population sizes are small and whilst heterozygosity and inbreeding are currently not a major concern, forward projections of heterozygosity decay are quite troubling. conservation efforts should focus on monitoring and maximizing diversity as well as tracking the overall robustness of the populations across time. there is a possibility that the chikso is fragmented into isolates; a priority should be to improve gene flow between the subpopulations. a challenging question that will need to be addressed in the near future is whether to fully close these populations and work with the available diversity or introduce new variation from mainland hanwoo. the relatively low differentiation at this point suggests that some level of introgression with hanwoo and careful phenotypic selection for the population’s distinguishing traits would not compromise the integrity of the breeds but it may be politically infeasible to implement.

CONCLUSIONS
the brown hanwoo cattle have been subjected to artificial selection within a national breeding program aimed at meat quality for several decades. two other varieties, the jeju black and the chikso cattle, were excluded from the national breeding program and remained insulated from recent artificial selection advancements. this led to a decline in population sizes due to a lack of commercial interest in the breeds. even though effective population sizes are small, there is currently little evidence of loss of genetic diversity or inbreeding. nevertheless, forward estimates of heterozygosity project a rapid loss of diversity which justifies measures aimed at preserving the jeju black and chikso population due to their historical and cultural relevance to korea. the jeju black and chikso varieties show some level of breed divergence from the mainland hanwoo cattle, though distinctly less than between other well characterized cattle breeds. from a purely genetic perspective there is limited value in managing these populations independently; but given their high social value for korea, a separate breeding program aimed at maximizing diversity and improving fitness is warranted.
