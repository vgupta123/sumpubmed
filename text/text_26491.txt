BACKGROUND
sugarcane  is of tremendous economic importance not just for the sugar industry but also for its impact on sustainable energy production. the ratoon sugarcane is the regenerated crop plant from the germinating bud of the stubble from the previous crop  <cit> . ratooning practice saves cost on preparatory tillage and planting material and benefits from the residual manure and moisture. in addition, the ratoon sugarcane matures earlier than the newly planted sugarcane . however, there is a decline in the yield of ratoon sugarcane in the successive years under normal conditions  <cit> . this has become one of the major problems in the high-yielding cultivation of sugarcane.

the expansion of crop monoculture has led to the simplification of the agroecosystem, and the loss and fragmentation of habitat  <cit> . large-scale monocultures result in a decline in the biological diversity, destroy the capability of self-adjustment of the ecosystem, and cause diseases, which further increases the production cost and pollute the environment because more pesticides and better fertilizers are required  <cit> . the yield decline has been defined as the loss of productive capacity of sugarcane soils under long-term monocultures  <cit> . gascho et al.  <cit>  found that productivity of the ratoon sugarcane was  <dig> percent less than the plant sugarcane due to increased mortality of stalks, reduction in soil nutrition status and abundance of pests and diseases in the soil. current evidences suggests that several factors  are responsible for the degradation of physical, chemical and microbial properties of sugarcane growing soils  <cit> . recent studies have revealed that crop rotation breaks and organic amendments greatly influence the structure and microbial populations of the sugarcane rhizospheric soil  <cit> . our previous study showed that ratooning cane, intercropped with legumes, enhanced the functional diversity of rhizospheric microbial community and increased cane yield . plant-soil organism interactions, especially plant-microbial interactions play crucial roles in soil quality, and crop health and yield  <cit> . there has been an increasing interest in the biological properties of rhizosphere in situ <cit> . however, there is no report hitherto focusing on the relationship among the soil ecosystem, soil organism community and sugarcane ratooning practice from a proteomic perspective.

various dna-dependent strategies, such as terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism  <cit> , denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis  <cit>  and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction  <cit>  have been used to elucidate the biological information from microbial communities in the soil ecosystem. however, since the mrna expression and protein expression do not always correlate directly, the function of microbial diversity still remains unknown  <cit> . moreover, the biological processes in rhizosphere soil are not only driven by the microbes but also by the plants and the fauna in the ecosystem  <cit> . extended soil protein identification is essential for understanding the soil ecological processes and the environmental factors that affect the functioning of the rhizospheric soil ecosystem  <cit> . two community-based measurements, community level physiological profiles  and soil metaproteomics were used in this work. the assessment of microbial functional diversity by using biolog sole carbon  substrate utilization tests is a rapid, sensitive approach to detect modifications in diversity due to soil management, disturbance, stress or succession  <cit> . soil rhizospheric metaproteomics is a powerful scientific tool to account for functional gene expression in microbial ecosystems and can uncover the interactions between plants and soil microorganisms  <cit> .

it was speculated that the yield decline in ratoon sugarcane is closely related to the dynamics and genetic diversity of the community members . therefore, in this study, we aimed to:  determine differences between the soil protein abundance in plant sugarcane and ratoon sugarcane rhizospheric soils, and  analyze interactions between the root system and the rhizospheric soil organisms based on our data from soil enzyme assays, clpp analysis, and a limited number of identified soil proteins.

RESULTS
sucrose content and theoretical production
the available stalk number per hectare, stalk diameter, single stalk weight and theoretical production of plant cane were found to be significantly  higher than those of ratoon cane. however, there were no significant differences in the sucrose content and stalk height of the  <dig> types of cane .

soil enzyme activity
except for polyphenol oxidase, the other enzymes, i.e. invertase, urease, phosphomonoesterase and peroxidase activities were found to be significantly higher in plant cane soil, than in ratoon cane soil or control soil. there were no significant differences in invertase and peroxidase activities between the control and ratoon cane soils. however, the control soil had significantly lower urease and phosphomonoesterase activities than ratoon cane soil .

microbial community dynamics assessed by biolog analysis
the average well-color development  of the carbon substrates for all soil samples using the biolog eco microplates indicated that the change in awcd increased with an increase in incubation time during the  <dig> h incubation period . the awcd followed the sequence, plant cane  > ratoon cane  > control , at almost every time point monitored. plant cane soil showed the largest rates of substrate utilization while ratoon cane soil displayed significantly lower rates. furthermore, clpp diversity and evenness, evaluated with the data from  <dig> h incubation, were found to be significantly lower in ratoon cane soil than in plant cane soil. both, shannon’s diversity and evenness indices were found to be the lowest in the control soil . the consumption of carbohydrates, amines, amino acids and phenolic compounds was significantly reduced in ratoon cane soil compared to that in plant cane soil . we found that phenolic compounds were mainly expended in control soil; carbohydrates and amines in plant cane soil; while carboxylic acids and amino acids were expended in ratoon cane soil.

note: data are means ± sd. different letters in rows show significant differences determined by tucky’s test .

principal component analysis  indicated that  <dig> h awcd data successfully distinguished the response of the  <dig> soil communities to the carbon substrates . the first principal component  accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation in the eco microplate data, while pc <dig> accounted for  <dig> % of the total variation in the eco microplate data. the eight carbon substrates with the most positive and most negative scores  on pc <dig> and pc <dig> are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  α-ketobutyric acid and d-glucosaminic acid were discriminated most positively by pc <dig> scores, while l-asparagine and d-galacturonic acid were discriminated most positively by pc <dig> scores. however, i-erythritol and glucose-1-phosphate were discriminated most negatively by pc <dig> scores, while d-galactonic acid γ-lactone and 4-hydroxy benzoic acid were discriminated most negatively by pc <dig> scores.

profile analysis of metaproteome in rhizospheric soils
approximately  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> protein spots were detected on silver-stained gel of proteins extracted from the control soil, plant cane soil, and ratoon cane soil respectively . highly reproducible 2-de maps were obtained from the three different soil samples with significant correlations among scatter plots. the correlation index between the control soils and the newly planted sugarcane soils was found to be  <dig> , and the correlation index between the control soils and the one year ratoon sugarcane soils were was  <dig> .

to obtain a metaproteomic profile for the sugarcane rhizospheric soil,  <dig> protein spots with high resolution and repeatability, including all  <dig> differentially expressed proteins and  <dig> constitutively expressed proteins, were selected for identification and  <dig> protein spots were successfully analyzed by maldi tof-tof ms .

according to gene ontology  annotations, the identified proteins were classified into  <dig> cellular component ,  <dig> molecular function  and  <dig> biological process  categories, as shown in figure  <dig>  highly represented categories were associated with ‘cell part’  and ‘organelle’  in cc, ‘catalytic activity’  and ‘binding’  in mf, ‘metabolic process’ , ‘cellular process’  and ‘response to stimulus’  in bp.

according to the putative physiological functions assigned using the kegg database, these soil proteins were categorized into  <dig> groups as shown in figure  <dig>  among these,  <dig> % were derived from plants,  <dig> % from bacteria,  <dig> % from fungi and  <dig> % from fauna . most of these identified proteins were associated with the carbohydrate/energy metabolism , amino acid metabolism  and protein metabolism . besides, ten proteins  were found to be involved in stress defense and eleven proteins  relating to the signal transduction were detected . based on the metaproteomic data, a tentative metabolic model for the rhizospheric soil proteins was proposed as shown in additional file 5: figure s <dig>  these soil proteins function in carbohydrate/energy, nucleotide, amino acid, protein, auxin metabolism and secondary metabolism, membrane transport, signal transduction and resistance, etc.. most of the plant proteins identified, were thought to participate in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, which might provide the necessary energy and precursor materials for the organic acid efflux and rhizodeposition process, defense responses and secondary metabolism under biotic and abiotic stresses. however, some microbial proteins related to the membrane transport  and signal transduction  were also identified in the rhizospheric soil, which might play an important role in the root colonization of microbes. these soil proteins probably influence the rhizodeposition process and mediate the interactions between the plants and the soil organisms.

differentially expressed proteins and their roles in rhizospheric soils
as shown in table  <dig>  the quantitative analysis revealed that a total of  <dig> protein spots  with high repeatability displayed differential expression by more than  <dig> -fold at least on one gel in comparison to the control  <cit> . these differentially expressed proteins originated from plants , bacteria , fungi  and fauna  .

note: protein spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  25- <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> shared equal searching by ms/ms and ms. protein spots  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> matched at least two ms/ms peptides. the remainders matched at least three pmfs. a) the numbering corresponds to the 2-de gel in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  b) gi number in ncbi. c) mascot score of pmf. d) the number of peptides identified by ms/sequence percentage coverage. e) theoretical molecular weight and pi. f) mascot score of ms/ms. g) number of peptides identified by ms/ms. h) functional classification using kegg database. i) the ratio of ratoon cane soil  to control soil . j) the ratio of ratoon cane soil  to plant cane soil .

among the plant-originating differentially expressed proteins, the largest functional group found was of the proteins involved in carbohydrate and energy metabolism , followed by those associated with stress/defense response  . furthermore, most of plant proteins related to carbohydrate/energy metabolism  and amino acid metabolism  were found up-regulated in the ratoon cane soil, compared to the plant cane and control soils . these up-regulated plant proteins involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism probably provide the energy necessary and precursor materials for plant root secretion and rhizodeposition process, which serve as a nutrient source for root-associated microbes. several proteins  related to plant stress defense were up-regulated in the ratoon cane soil .

among the microbe-originating differentially expressed proteins, most of them were associated with the carbohydrate/energy metabolism  and signal transduction  . several microbial proteins were found related to the root-colonizing ability of microorganisms  and the utilization of root exudates  were up-regulated in the ratoon cane soil, as compared to the plant cane and control soil , which might be a response of microbes to the rhizodeposition of ratoon cane. furthermore, most of proteins originated from fungi  were up-regulated in the ratoon cane soil . besides, one cytoskeleton protein  originated from the fauna was identified as well. therefore, sugarcane ratooning induced the alteration of the expression of soil proteins from the plants, microbes and fauna.

discussion
the consecutive monocultures for many medicinal plants and crop plants, such as rehmannia glutinosa <cit>  and soybea  <cit> , etc., result in a significant reduction in the yield and quality of the harvest. this phenomenon is known as soil sickness   <cit>  or consecutive monoculture problems  <cit> . in the present study, the available stalk number per hectare, stalk diameter, single stalk weight) and theoretical production of ratoon cane were found to be significantly  lower than those of plant cane . hunsigi  <cit>  indicated that ratooning practice decreased soil fertility under consecutive sugarcane cropping. several researchers developed a ‘farming systems’ approach to address the problem of sugarcane cultivation with a major focus on the introduction of rotation breaks and organic amendments and found that these practices induced remarkable changes in the commnunity composition and structure of the soil biota   <cit> . enzyme activity in soil is a measure of the soil microbial activity and plays an important role in nutrient cycles and transformations. therefore, it is used as an indicator of changes into determine changes in quality and productivity of soil  <cit> . in the present study, five soil enzymes activities involved in nutrition cycling and stress response were assayed. our data showed that the activities of soil enzymes such as invertase, urease, phosphomonoesterase and peroxidase were significantly lower  in ratoon cane soil than in plant cane soil .

the assessment of microbial functional diversity by carbon substrate utilization patterns has been reported to be a sensitive approach to detect variability in metabolic potential due to soil management  <cit> . in the current work, the biolog results showed that ratooning practice led to significant decreases  in awcd, shannon’s diversity, and evenness indices in soil as compared to the plant cane soil . particularly, there were significantly lower levels  of carboxyhydrates, amines and amino acids used in ratoon cane soil than in plant cane soil . principal component analysis allowed the differentiation of ratoon cane soil from the control and the plant cane soil. however, the use of biolog eco microplates to analyze the metabolic diversity of the microbial community represents only the in situ phenomena where only the fast growing microbes are involved, and ignores the catabolic profiles of functionally inactive microorganisms  <cit> . preston-mafham et al.  <cit>  claimed that biolog measurements should be applied in community comparisons rather than in community characterization. the trophic structure and the relationship between its components in soil are still poorly understood as the soil food web and biochemical processes are extraordinarily complex. comparative metaproteomics was used to study the differences in functional gene expression that are mediated by sugarcane ratooning practice in the rhizosphere ecosystem. these differentially expressed proteins were related to various metabolic pathways such as carbohydrate/energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism, signal transduction, membrane transport, and stress/defense response etc.. these results might help to unravel the intricate interactions among plant root systems, root exudates, and rhizospheric microflora.

differentially expressed plant proteins under ratooning practice
our metaproteomic analysis showed that the  <dig> proteins  linked to the glycolysis  / tricarboxylic acid  cycle and one protein  involved in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism were highly expressed in the ratoon cane soil, as compared to the plant cane and control soils . these proteins are probably associated with the release of root exudates from plants. many root exudates  are mostly the intermediates of the tca cycle or amino acid metabolism. singh and mukerji  <cit>  suggested that these root exudates were the determinants of rhizospheric microbial biodiversity. root exudates act as chemo-attractants that function to attract bacteria towards roots  <cit> . the qualitative and quantitative composition of root exudates is affected by various environmental factors  and the presence of microorganisms. the up-regulation of these proteins involved in the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism might be explained by a change in the composition of root exudates possibly resulting from soil disturbances which might be caused by ratooning.

in this study, three proteins linked to plant stress/defense response  showed higher expression levels in the ratoon cane soil than in the plant cane and control soils . catalase and heat shock protein  <dig>  have been proven to be critical for various abiotic and biotic stress responses  <cit> . the above mentioned proteins are rapidly up-regulated in pathogen infection and play a central role in defense against pathogens  <cit> . prmc <dig> is a member of a family of proteins that all contain a ser-hydrolase motif  and is similar to the tobacco protein hsr203j  <cit> . hsr203j is rapidly and specifically expressed in the hypersensitive response to various pathogens in tobacco  <cit> . furthermore, zhou et al.  <cit>  found that the gene expression of prmc <dig> was up-regulated in the plant leaves infected by the bacterial pathogen xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicola. therefore, the up-regulation of catalase, prmc <dig> and hsp <dig> might imply that ratoon cane was confronted with environmental stress in the soil, which possibly results from the presence of certain pathogens   <cit>  or other abiotic stresses in the ratooning system.

differentially expressed microbial proteins under ratooning practice
the results from our experiments showed that the two proteins  linked to the membrane transport and one protein  related to signal transduction had higher expression levels in the ratoon cane soil, as compared to the plant cane and control soils . abc transporters are multicomponent systems, which include one or two integral membrane proteins that constitute the channel across the membrane, an atp-binding protein that hydrolyzes atp and drives the transport, and in most cases, an extracellular solute-binding protein  <cit> . abc transport systems play an important role in many different aspects of bacterial physiology, facilitating the import of nutrients, and in the extrusion of toxins and antimicrobial agents  <cit> . sugar abc transporters facilitate the transport of a variety of sugars. some microorganisms utilize highly efficient sugar abc transporters to survive when substrate concentrations are extremely low  <cit> . the two-component system sensor kinase  was also found to be up-regulated in our study. the two-component system is one of the signal transduction systems in microorganisms that consists of a sensor histidine kinase  and a response regulator . this system responds to a large number of environmental signals  <cit>  and is postulated to play an important role in root colonization  <cit> . the up-regulation of the proteins involved in membrane transport and signal transduction might be related to the utilization of rhizodeposition by root-associated bacteria. this probably facilitates root colonization by these bacteria. besides, most of proteins originated from fungi  showed higher expression levels in ratoon cane soil than in the plant cane and control soils . the functional gene expression differences in soil microbial communities are probably mediated by a change in the amount and composition of root exudates  <cit> .

despite the limited number of soil proteins identified, our metaproteomic analysis results, combined with soil enzyme assays and clpp analysis, provide a solid foundation to understand the interactions between the soil organisms and plants in the soil ecosystem. environmental metaproteomics has been demonstrated to be a useful tool for structural and functional characterization of microbial communities in their natural habitat  <cit> , with an increasing improvement in ms performance  <cit>  and soil protein extraction  <cit> . metaproteomics is most powerful when combined with metagenomics or when using unmatched metagenomic datasets  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
our experiments revealed that ratooning practice significantly decreased the activity of soil enzymes, catabolic activity, and shannon’s diversity and evenness indices. the comparative soil metaproteomics revealed that sugarcane ratooning induced changes in the expression levels of soil proteins originated from the plants, microbes and fauna. a majority of up-regulated plant proteins were found to be related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism and stress response, while most of up-regulated microbial proteins were involved in membrane transport and signal transduction. in conclusion, sugarcane ratooning practice induced great changes in the soil enzyme activities, the catabolic diversity of microbial community and the expression level of soil proteins. these changes were found to influence the biochemical processes in the rhizosphere ecosystem and mediated the interactions between plants and soil microbes. the soil proteins identified in our study are almost certainly a small part of the diversity of proteins that were expressed by the plants and soil microbial communities. yet, environmental metaproteomics is a powerful tool to study plant-microbe interactions in soil.
