BACKGROUND
proteins seldom perform their biological function independently. rather, they collaborate with other biological molecules such as nucleic acids and proteins to accomplish complex biological processes. protein-protein interactions play fundamental roles in almost all biological processes such as signal transduction, internal equilibrium maintenance and organs formation  <cit> . consequently, mapping genome-wide protein-protein interactions has been one of the key tasks of systems biology to understand cellular processes  <cit> .

high-throughput experiments, like yeast two-hybrid system , ap-ms method and bimolecular fluorescence complementation   <cit> , have been employed widely at genome-scale to construct protein-protein interaction networks of model organisms such as saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens and escherichia coli k <dig>  <cit> . but large scale experiments are far from widespread use due to huge financial costs and time consuming experiments. computational approaches provide a rapid and convenient scan for a preliminary sight before the commencement of comprehensive observations of experimental proteins interaction. they also provide reasonable complements to existing experimental protein interaction networks. with in-depth study of experimental protein interactions, especially the increase of model organisms' protein interaction data generated by large-scale and high-throughput experiments, computational approaches to predict protein-protein interactions in a particular species have been increasingly efficient and effective. combined with literature extraction of existing protein interactions  <cit> , genomic information, protein structure and annotation information, bioinformatics play an important role in method study of protein-protein interaction prediction, high-quality protein-protein interaction databases establishment, software and webserver development for visualizing protein-protein interaction networks and genome-scale analysis of protein interaction networks  <cit> .

although protein-protein interactions confirmed in the lab are in a low coverage of the whole proteome, including those of model organisms such as human and fruit fly  <cit> , these findings can offer useful biological information for the prediction of novel protein-protein interactions in a particular species of interest. machine learning methods like naïve bayes  <cit>  and svm  <cit>  have been used to extract biological information from golden-standard protein interaction data to model classifiers for prediction. such computational methods depend highly on the reliability of golden-standard data; hence show limitations in organisms that have little existing experimental data for training.

genome information is another important source for protein-protein interaction prediction. these types of method usually use genome information  to obtain functional dependence between protein pairs  <cit> . gene neighbourhood hypothesizes that if proteins in different genomes are corresponding to adjacent genes, these proteins are considered to be functionally related and therefore are more likely to interact with each other  <cit> . gene fusion means that if two functionally related proteins in a genome possess homologous similarities, and they can be fused into a compound protein, these two proteins are likely to interact with each other  <cit> . phylogenetic profile describes the presence of homologous proteins in a series of species. by clustering phylogenetic profiles, proteins with similar or identical phylogenetic profile patterns are considered to be functionally linked, and they are more likely to interact with each other as well  <cit> . early methods usually considered genomic information independently , but more and more prediction methods combine several or all genome information together to improve the precision of prediction .

methods based on evolutionary information such as correlated mutation, interologs  <cit> , correlated evolutionary rate have achieved dramatic improvements in cross-species protein-protein interaction prediction. evolutionarily conserved protein-protein interaction is based on the theory of evolutionary conservation of protein, which is known as ortholog. the interolog method is mainly dependent on protein ortholog algorithms such as inparanoid  <cit> . orthologous proteins are used to locate conserved protein-protein interactions among species. it has been proved that many pathways such as gtpase signaling transduction significantly show their evolutionary conservation in different species, especially the pathway motif , appears in many different pathways  <cit> . over the years these prediction methods of protein interactions have been successfully applied in human, yeast, fruit fly and other model species, achieving appreciated results  <cit> . the online predicted human interaction database  extracts the evolutionarily conserved orthologous protein-protein interactions from saccharomyces cerevisiae and drosophila melanogaster with the interolog method, which is then combined with literature mining data to construct the human protein interaction network. the most important trend of interolog methods is taking both the orthologous information and genomic information into consideration to obtain high quality protein-protein interaction networks, such as the approaches applied in mpid  <cit>  and athppi  <cit> .

the complexity of plant materials presents a big obstacle to find analytical protein-protein interactions in plant proteomics research  <cit> . the genome-scale experimental approach-based plant interactome has not been constructed, only a few protein-protein interaction networks are constructed to address several particular biological questions. arabidopsis thaliana is the only plant species in which a global-goal applicable interactome was computationally constructed  <cit> . there are several arabidopsis thaliana protein-protein interaction databases with different approaches: atpin  <cit>  and atpid  <cit>  with integration approach, athppi  <cit>  and predicted arabidopsis interactome  <cit>  with interolog approach, and pair  <cit>  with machine learning approach. however, publicly available computational protein-protein interaction resource for the model monocotyledon oryza sativa is still lacking.

rare experimental protein interaction data and low level of genomic annotation information are the two main barriers for computational methods to be widely used for oryza sativa. machine learning methods such as svm and naïve bayes network require both high quality golden-standard experimental data and huge genomic annotations. as a result, interolog method combined with limited rice genome information appears to be a realizable way to construct an unprecedented rice protein interaction network. in this study, we attempt to computationally depict a panorama of rice interactome with interolog method, where genome information such as go annotations, subcellular localization information and gene expression data are utilised to validate the predicted protein interaction network and at the same time, to extract significant biological network properties.

RESULTS
network construction
our network construction is divided into two main parts:  integration of six reference model organism interactomes and  interologs between rice and the reference organisms, as shown in figure  <dig> 

experimental protein-protein interaction data of model organisms is constantly increasing at a high rate. in order to obtain high coverage and accuracy of our predicted protein-protein interactions, we started with the re-integration of public protein interaction databases and species-specific protein interaction databases. six model organisms are selected as the reference species for our prediction: arabidopsis thaliana, saccharomyces cerevisiae, caenorhabditis elegans, drosophila melanogaster, homo sapiens and escherichia coli k <dig>  whose experimental interactomes are the most complete and reliable. among these  <dig> model organisms, arabidopsis thaliana, a plant species, logically shares the highest evolutionary conservation with rice, while  saccharomyces cerevisiae has the best coverage of its genome. we derived their protein interaction data from public non-species-specific protein-protein interaction databases: biogrid  <cit> , intact  <cit> , mint  <cit>  and dip  <cit> , and additional data is from species-specific databases: mips  <cit>  for yeast, hprd  <cit>  for human and tair  <cit>  for arabidopsis thaliana. as high-throughput experiments are well-known for their high rate of false positives, there are many noisy records with redundancy and inaccuracy in public protein interaction databases. we either corrected or discarded these errors during the integration process. with their relatively less redundancy and inaccuracy, species-specific databases offer important supplementary data to our integration. we finally integrated  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of the  <dig> model organisms, which significantly exceeds previous orthologous data used in interolog predictions. as shown in figure  <dig>  we integrated  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of arabidopsis thaliana,  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of saccharomyces cerevisiae,  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>   <dig> proteins of homo sapiens,  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of drosophila melanogaster,  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of caenorhabditis elegans and finally,  <dig>  interactions with  <dig>  proteins of escherichia coli k <dig> . inparanoid, as mentioned in background, calculates the ortholog among proteins based on its own algorithm, using the best blast score. we picked inparanoid as the ortholog algorithm because its reliability and availability have been proven among many other interolog methods. inparanoid clusters ortholog pairs with "bootstrap confidence values" and "inparalog scores". "inparalog scores" reflect the conserved evolutionary distance between an ortholog pair. in order to restrict the sensitivity and definition of our prediction, only ortholog pairs with top "inparalog"  were selected in our interolog method. the distribution of orthologs from  <dig> model organisms is shown in figure  <dig>  by mapping the latest version inparanoid <dig>  <cit>  orthologous to our integrated protein interaction database, we identified  <dig>  predicted interactions with  <dig>  rice proteins. among these interactions,  <dig>  interactions are found in more than one model organism.

datasets based on inparanoid <dig> ortholog pairs without score cut-off were also generated in our study,  <dig> , <dig> protein interactions with  <dig>  rice proteins were predicted totally , which showed high redundancy and low sensitivity based on our examination. as reported by huang et al.  <cit> , true positive rate of prediction is significantly reduced with the reduction of the inparanoid score cut off, we omitted all this huge amounts of data from reliable rice protein interactions, and score cut off with  <dig>  was taken as an internal quality control.

go annotations of predicted interactome
gene ontology  is an important bioinformatics tool for genome-scale protein function annotation. go tries to explain the roles of genes or proteins in eukaryotic cellular process through the establishment of a controlled vocabulary. go consists of three separate ontologies: cellular component , molecular function  and biological process . go uses directed acyclic graph to connect each ontology and renders tree hierarchical relationships between these ontologies. two proteins involved in the same biological processes have higher possibility to interact than two proteins that are not. moreover, the more specific a biological process the two proteins are involved in, the likelihood of interaction is higher. similarly, a more detailed go annotation will provide a higher chance of interaction. go mapping can provide an effective measure of the possibility of predicted protein interactions that occur naturally. we mapped the go annotations derived from gene ontology database  <cit>  and gramene  <cit>  to the predicted rice interactome, finally obtaining  <dig>  proteins in our network that were highly annotated, with over 84% coverage. we used the well-known go slim classification system to measure the distribution of go terms in our networks. we chose the standard uniprotkb-goa go slim to construct catalogs for go terms, and go slim viewer provided by agbase  <cit>  were taken to calculate the distribution of go terms in our networks. as shown in figure 3a, proteins with molecular function go annotated "binding" , with biological process go annotated "metabolic process" , and with cellular component go annotated "intracellular"  and appear most frequently in our network. three separate go term distribution of the proteins in predicted interaction network were compared with that of the whole rice genome. as shown in figure 3b, the distribution of proteins with cellular component terms vested in "cellular component", "intracellular" and "cell" is particularly similar to rice genome . this high specific similarity also appears in biological process terms vested in "metabolic process" and "cell differentiation"; molecular function terms vested in "protein binding" and "hydrolase activity". all these terms display the highest distribution in our network. the pearson correlation coefficient scores for go term distribution between our network and rice genome were calculated: score for cellular component terms was  <dig> , sore for biological process terms was  <dig>  and score for molecular function terms was  <dig> . these extremely high person correlation coefficient scores show that tthe proteins in our predicted network exhibit equal distribution against the whole rice genome, rather than restricted to only several certain biological aspects.

we lead relative specificity similarity  scores  <cit>  into prin to evaluate the go correlation coefficient between two interaction proteins. relative specificity similarity scores are mainly based on go term similarity and go depth . three independent rssgo scores were calculated separately, rsscc scores for go cell component terms, rssbp scores for go biological process terms and rssmf scores for go molecular function terms. as the rssgo distribution shown in figure 3c, rsscc scores of our network mainly fall within  <dig> ~1; rssbp scores mainly fall within  <dig> ~ <dig> ; rssmf scores mainly fall within  <dig> ~ <dig> . the high proportion of rssmf score 0~ <dig>  is mainly due to the imperfection of rice go molecular function terms. all the proportions of score  <dig>  in three kinds rssgo scores are very high:  <dig> % for rsscc scores,  <dig> % for rssbp scores and  <dig> % for rssmf scores. this shows that two proteins in prin share stronger correlation in go annotation, indicating a higher possibility to interact with each other.

subcellular localization of predicted interactome
subcellular localization is the specific location a protein or gene product exists in where the cell, such as nuclear, cytoplasm or cell membrane. it plays an important role in understanding cellular organs function and compartmentalization characteristics. proteins have to fulfill the conditions for space identity during interactions; hence interacting proteins tend to possess the same subcellular localization, known as co-localization. currently there is no specific subcellular localization database for rice. the rare and scattered rice subcellular localization information presents a difficult task for figures collection. to tackle this, we opted for a computational subcellular localization identifier rslpred  <cit> , which is signally better than another identifier plant-ploc  <cit>  because of its rice species-specific characteristic. with the integration of ebi and tigr rice protein subcellular localization as predicted by rslpred, we finally obtained  <dig>  interactions with subcellular localization information in our predicted interactome, in which  <dig> % is co-localized. four kinds of protein subcellular localizations were catalogued: chloroplast, cytoplasm, mitochondria and nucleus. nucleus-nucleus co-localization was responsible for the largest share  among all the protein interactions with subcellular localization information; this may not be surprising because  <dig> % of proteins having subcellular localization annotations were predicted to nucleus localized by rslpred.

co-expression of predicted interactome
if proteins exhibit interaction, there are some quantitative requirements which are closely related to gene expression profile. using microarray based expression data to predict protein-protein interactions has become a trend in computational systems biology. in protein-protein interaction prediction by gene expression, the most common method is the calculation of the pearson correlation coefficient between two sets of gene expression data. many predicted protein interactions based on gene expression profile fall into indirect interactions, also known as function related chains, resulting in high level of false positives in the prediction data. nevertheless, gene co-expression levels still contain important reference value to protein interactions predicted by interologs. this implies that, no gene expression correlation does not entirely mean that the two proteins do not interact, however, if two proteins gene expression correlate, it will greatly increase the possibility of interaction. especially, if a protein has a significant inhibition or synergistic effect with another protein as shown by gene expression profile, these two proteins should be strongly considered to interact. in our study, rice co-expression data from rice array database  <cit>  was used to map to our predicted interactome, which is derived from  <dig> rice affymetrix microarray data . the pearson correlation coefficient score  was calculated to measure the correlation of two genes expression. total of  <dig>  of our predicted interactions successfully obtained their pcc score, with a certain pearson correlation coefficient score cut off  <dig> ; eventually we acquired  <dig>  interologs with co-expression relationship. the contribution of pcc score in prin is shown in figure  <dig>  we discovered  <dig> % protein pairs with significant inhibition against each other . however synergy  is much more prevail than inhibition  in prin. protein pairs in our network mainly fall within  <dig> ~ <dig>  section, which shows a significant co-relationship in their gene expression levels.

web interface
the web interface of prin was developed with java  and was hosted on an apache web server. the project used mysql  <dig>  as its database management system and cytoscape web  <cit>  to visualize the protein-protein interaction network. we provide two ways to access our database:  a protein can be queried by its symbol name, loc number, or uniprot accession in the protein search page, then our server will return all the proteins which are predicted to interact with the submission.  if users have a list of proteins and want to know whether they interact between each other, just paste this list of proteins into the submit box of interaction search page, then our server will return all the interactions involving these proteins. prin provide both graphical results and table results  for users to get proteins and interactions information. more detail information can be seen through clicking protein id and interaction id in the result table.

discussion
network validation
a small data set of experiments determined rice protein-protein interaction including  <dig> proteins and  <dig> interactions is integrated from bind  <cit>  , intact  <cit>  and plapid  <cit> . although this experimental interactome is too small a coverage on the rice whole interactome,  <dig> proteins are also found in our network, which constitute  <dig> interactions in our network and  <dig> interactions in the integrated experimental network. among these  <dig> interactions,  <dig> have been determined by experiments, revealing a reasonable sensitive considering the rare and low coverage experimental data.

rssgo score has been used as a reliable data training method in earlier protein interaction prediction studies  <cit> . in our study, rssgo score was taken as an inspection method towards our predicted data. we calculated the rssgo score of protein pairs in our network, both of rsscc score, rssbp score and rssmf score above  <dig>  is counted. it was found that  <dig> % of them are in a high co-annotated level as rssgo score cut off  <dig> . this indicates that protein pairs in prin more likely to participate in the same bioprocess, exhibits similar molecular function and constitute to the same cellular structure, which all leads to a high possibility of protein interaction.

we mapped the gene expression data to the  <dig> experimental interactions, and successfully found  <dig> of them with pcc scores, in which  <dig> pairs having co-expression. although statistical meaning is obviously lacking due to the limitation of rare experimental data, it significantly indicates that interaction proteins have a tendency to co-express. protein pairs in our network show an obviously high co-expression rate , compared to random pairs derived from global rice genome. we calculated co-expression rate of all gene pairs appeared in the microarray, and only  <dig> % of them display co-expression pattern with pearson correlation coefficient score cut off  <dig> . therefore, the co-expression quality of our predicted network is highly notable.

network visualization and topology
by loading the predicted rice protein-protein interaction data to cytoscape  <cit> , we obtained visualization of the whole network. we used cytoscape plug-in networkanalyzer  <cit>  to get topological properties of our network . an inner-interactome of prin is partially shown in figure 5a. this type of inner-interactome, also found in arabidopsis thaliana and yeast, implies that little proteins interact individually in the interactome  <cit> . an insightful view of this core interactome is presented in figure 5b with nodes degree information, subcellular localization and co-expression level.

we made a comparison of network topology properties between the rice interactome and other six species . a connected component value of  <dig> suggests that oryza sativa has similar interactome connectivity with caenorhabditis elegans, stronger interactome connectivity than arabidopsis thaliana and homo sapiens, and weaker than saccharomyces cerevisiae, drosophila melanogaster, escherichia coli k <dig>  proteins in our predicted interactome possess an average of  <dig> neighbours, which is closed to homo sapiens, less than saccharomyces cerevisiae, more than arabidopsis thaliana, drosophila melanogaster, caenorhabditis elegans and escherichia coli k <dig>  this finding may not be surprising since yeast and human are the major interologs source to our data. it has been shown in yeast and human that the average number of neighbours will increase with upgrading of interactome coverage, which indirectly implies a relatively good coverage on our predicted interactome.

the node degree of an interactome shows the number of edges a protein is linked to, where self-interaction is also counted. the node degree distribution of our network shows the scale-free network topologies of rice protein-protein interaction network. apart from self-interacted proteins, proteins in prin mainly fall within 2- <dig> degree hubs, as shown in figure 5c. we constructed hub catalog by partly reference to jane's studies  <cit> . as shown in figure 5d, the node degree distribution of our network shows the scale-free network topological property. most proteins in scale-free networks have low interactions, and a few proteins have high network connection degrees, which are called distribution node proteins. scale-free protein interaction network is subject to distribution node proteins, and it has high tolerance to sudden environment pressure.

the shortest path length distribution, as presented in figure 5e, demonstrates the significant small world property of our predicted rice interactome. the small world properties imply a strong fault-tolerance to our network, as well as to real protein-protein interaction networks  <cit> . the small world property shows good fault tolerance and stability of our network. when expressions of a few proteins are suppressed under environment pressure, biological pathways will not be ended but can be completed by other alternative proteins. in such small world networks, information transmission speed is very fast, corresponding with rapid changes of environment pressure. the stress centrality counts how many times a protein being passed through by a shortest path. if a protein is passed by a high amount of shortest paths, it experiences higher stress, suggesting that it has more important biological function  <cit> . the stress centrality distribution is shown in figure 5f.

the clustering coefficient is a ratio n/m, where n is given as the number of edges between the neighbours of a protein, and m is given as the maximum number of edges that could possibly exist between the neighbours of a protein. it is calculated as cn = 2en/), where kn is the number of neighbours of n and en is the number of connected pairs between all neighbours of protein n  <cit> . the average of the clustering coefficients of proteins in different degree is shown in figure 5g. the high clustering coefficient value suggests that protein-protein interaction in rice is highly modular, and cellular function in real ppi network is likely to be implemented in a highly modular approach. research in metabolic networks using the average clustering coefficient distribution has shown the modular tendency in metabolic networks  <cit> . therefore, clustering coefficient is a very useful methodology to identify functional modular in rice protein-protein interaction network.

the neighbourhood connectivity of a protein, defined by networkanalyzer, is the average interaction numbers of all neighbours of this protein. as shown in figure 5h, the neighbourhood connectivity of prin first increased followed by decreased. this indicates that proteins in low degrees  tend to interact with those of proteins in low degrees, but in high degrees field , it is more prevail that proteins in high degrees interact with those of low degree proteins in prin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
prin is based on a sophisticated computational method known as interologs, combined with the genomic features of rice. there are certain inner quality controls in our network construction: the huge amount of integrated model organisms' protein-protein interactions, manual proofreading mismatch ids in database integration, restricted orthologous data with top inparanoid score and manual verification of the resulting network. genomic feature of rice, such as go annotations, subcellular location and gene expression data, is mapped to prin in order to validate our network and obtain biologically significant results as well. finally we acquired  <dig>  desirable interactions among  <dig>  proteins . according to the comparisons with small experiment interactome and random interactome, prin shows satisfactory tendency in co-go annotation, co-localization and co-expression, making it reliable for perspective studies in rice functional biology and systems biology. a well-organized web interface has been developed for network visualization and database search, which will be updated weekly for new interologs detection. it is publicly available at http://bis.zju.edu.cn/prin/. we have found many conserved basic metabolic pathways among species through the interolog process and most excitingly new protein complexes join known pathways. pathways expansion, metabolic module detection, and protein complex functional annotation based on prin will be the most important features for our further comprehensive genomic functional determination in prin.
