BACKGROUND
the pc- <dig> cell line has been used extensively as a model of neuronal differentiation, as the cells halt proliferation, have outgrowth of neurites and acquire properties of sympathetic neurons after exposure to nerve growth factor   <cit> . the differentiation response starts with the stimulation of receptor tyrosine kinase  which activates the intracellular signal transduction cascades, including those mediated by raf-mapk kinase-erk and other pathways regulated by rho family of small gtpases  <cit> . during the last few years, there have also been reports of negative regulators of neuronal differentiation in pc- <dig> cells, such as sprouty  family of proteins and idh3α  <cit> .

diva/bclb is a member of the bcl- <dig> family of proteins. a human ortholog has also been identified, and designated as bclb or bcl2l <dig>  it is also known as boo . diva/bclb contains bh <dig>  bh <dig>  bh <dig>  and bh <dig> regions and a carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic domain. it is distributed in the brain, liver, and heart of e <dig> embryonic mice. interestingly, in adult mice the expression of diva/bclb decreases dramatically and becomes restricted to the granulosa cells of the ovary and the seminiferous tubules of the testis  <cit> . diva/bclb labeling in seminiferous tubules is consistent with a stage-specific expression during spermatogenesis. thus far, most reports on diva/bclb have reported on its effect on apoptosis. diva/bclb has been reported to form a ternary complex with apoptosis-activating factor- <dig>  and caspase- <dig>  to induce bh- <dig> independent cell death  <cit> . however, boo was reported to inhibit apoptosis through homodimerization or heterodimerization with some pro-apoptotic  and anti-apoptotic  bcl- <dig> family members  <cit> . more recently, diva/bclb was shown to mediate cell death through interaction with a nucleoside diphosphate kinase  isoform, nm23-h2/ndpk b  <cit> .

nm23/ndpk are house keeping enzymes needed for transfer of the terminal phosphate of a nucleoside triphosphate to a nucleoside diphosphate. out of the ten known human nm <dig> family genes, ndpka/nm23h <dig> and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> are the most abundant and ubiquitous isoforms, and are located both in the nuclei and cytoplasm  <cit> . apart from its kinase activity, nm23/ndpk has been suggested to be involved in a variety of cellular functions including differentiation, proliferation, gene regulation and apoptosis  <cit> . overexpression of nm23-m <dig> protein induced neurite outgrowth and increased the expression of neurofilament and microtubule proteins, whereas downregulation of nm23/ndpk enhanced cell proliferation and inhibited neuronal differentiation  <cit> .

thus far, the physiological role of diva/bclb has remained elusive due to a paucity of information. even its function in apoptosis is highly controversial with many opposing reports. recently, there has been evidence of diva/bclb having a direct role in development. knockdown of the zebrafish ortholog  resulted in disorganized somites, increased levels of snail- <dig>  and disorganisation of the microtubule network and f-actin depolymerisation in the yolk sac  <cit> . diva/bclb has a decreased expression pattern during development, and is known to interact with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> which is involved in cellular differentiation. these findings prompted us to investigate if diva/bclb also has a role in cellular differentiation. using overexpression studies, we demonstrated that diva/bclb negatively regulates pc- <dig> neuronal differentiation, by affecting neurite outgrowth and cell proliferation. furthermore, we report that diva/bclb mediates these processes through its interaction and regulation of subcellular localization of ndpk b/nm23h <dig> 

RESULTS
up-regulation of ndpkb and down-regulation of diva during neuronal differentiation
to address whether ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and diva/bclb may play physiological roles in neuronal differentiation, we examined the expression of these proteins during pc- <dig> neuronal differentiation. pc- <dig> cells showed a steady and significant increase in ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin mrna levels, with a concurrent decrease in diva/bclb mrna levels during the course of ngf-induced differentiation . detection of protein expressions using immunocytochemistry also showed the up-regulation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and down-regulation of diva/bclb .

in the cells not treated with ngf, the distribution of diva/bclb was detected to be in the cytoplasm, and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> was mostly in the cytoplasm with some cells staining positive for the nucleus as well. by  <dig> days after ngf-induced differentiation, the cells expressed a lesser amount of diva/bclb and this low expression was maintained at  <dig> days after differentiation. in contrast, differentiated cells stained more intensely for ndpkb/nm23h <dig> after  <dig> days of differentiation and remain elevated even at  <dig> days, and a greater percentage of cells showed staining for the nucleus as compared to the control . statistical analysis showed the percentage of cells with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> b in the nucleus was significantly elevated after the cells differentiate .

ndpkb/nm23h <dig> protein promotes outgrowth of neurites
in order to investigate if the increased expression ndpkb/nm23h <dig> were directly involved in the process of differentiation, we overexpressed ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the pc- <dig> cell line. for this purpose, pc- <dig> cells were transfected with 2μg of control and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> plasmids. quantification of protein levels  showed that overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> resulted in a significant increase in ndpkb/nm23h <dig> levels, upregulation in β-tubulin levels, and downregulation in diva/bclb expression. this is similar to the expression profile of these proteins during ngf-induced differentiation.

the ectopic ndpkb/nm23h <dig> protein was expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm of the transfected cells . even without ngf treatment, the ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpressing cells also had little branches appearing, suggesting that ndpkb/nm23h <dig> might help to initiate neuronal differentiation. when exposed to ngf, the cells overexpressing ndpkb/nm23h <dig> also had a more branched morphology, with greater outgrowth of neurites . ectopic ndpkb/nm23h <dig> was expressed in both nucleus and cytoplasm of the transfected cells, therefore leading to significant increases in the percentages of undifferentiated and differentiated cells with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in their nucleus . cells that overexpressed ndpkb/nm23h <dig> had  <dig> ± <dig> % differentiated cells, which was significantly more than the  <dig> ± <dig> % in the control . they also had longer neurites, measuring  <dig> . <dig> ±  <dig>  μm as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in control cells . therefore, this shows that upregulation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> during differentiation facilitates neurite outgrowth.

diva/bclb inhibits neurite outgrowth and prevents the translocation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> into the nucleus during differentiation
since ngf-induced differentiation of pc- <dig> cells as well as ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpression resulted in downregulation of diva/bclb expression, we next investigated if diva/bclb might be a negative regulator of neuronal differentiation. for this purpose, pc- <dig> cells were transfected with control or diva/bclb plasmid. overexpression of diva did not affect the protein expression level of β-tubulin and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> . in the undifferentiated cells, overexpression of diva/bclb resulted in a slight but non-significant increase in percentage of cells with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the nucleus, so the majority of the protein was still expressed in the cytoplasm . however, in the differentiated cells, ectopic expression of diva/bclb affected ndpkb/nm23h <dig> localization and cellular morphology. cells with strong expression of diva/bclb had shorter neurites with strong co-localization of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> at the neurite terminal , whereas cells with downregulated diva/bclb expression had long neurites. diva/bclb overexpressing cells had  <dig> ± <dig> % differentiated cells, which was significantly lesser than the  <dig> ± <dig> % in the control  . diva/bclb overexpressing cells also had shorter neurites, measuring  <dig>  ±  <dig> μm as compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm in control cells  .

while the control cells that were differentiated had translocation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> to the nucleus, cells that were overexpressing diva/bclb had most of their nucleus unstained with the ndpkb/nm23h <dig> antibody despite differentiation . analysis showed that the percentage of differentiated cells with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in their nucleus was lesser in diva-overexpressing cells , indicating that diva might be sequestering ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the cytoplasm.

diva/bclb inhibits neurite outgrowth by preventing the association of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin
as it is known that β-tubulin is a component of microtubules, and that neuritogenesis requires changes to the cytoskeletal network, we studied the interactions of diva/bclb, ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin to further understand the mechanism through which diva/bclb inhibited neurite outgrowth. using duolink kit, which is a proximity ligation assay kit, we examined the subcellular locations and amounts of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin as well as diva/bclb and β-tubulin complexes.

overexpression of diva/bclb led to increased amounts of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  as well as diva/bclb and β-tubulin complexes in undifferentiated cells. this was maintained at a relatively high number even after differentiation . in contrast, overexpression of diva/bclb resulted in fewer ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes in both undifferentiated and differentiated cells . hence, the interaction between diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> would retain ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the cytosol and prevent interaction of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin, which then results in decreased neurite outgrowth.

diva/bclb increases and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> decreases cell proliferation
next, we examined the effects of diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> on cell proliferation as cell cycle exit is one of the hallmarks of neuronal differentiation. to this end, we compared the proliferation rates of the undifferentiated and differentiated transfected cells, by staining them with brd-u antibodies  <dig> hours after differentiation . ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpressing cells in the control group had a significantly lesser number of cells that were in s phase . in fact, the number of dividing cells in the undifferentiated ndpkb/nm23h <dig> was similar to the differentiated control group, suggesting that increased ndpkb/nm23h <dig> expression is responsible for the decreased proliferation during differentiation in normal cells. overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> was also able to further decrease the number of cycling cells in the differentiated group . in contrast, diva/bclb overexpressing cells had a higher percentage of cells nuclei with brdu staining . hence, ectopic diva/bclb expression results in an elevated proliferation rate.

using mts assay, growth curves for control, diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> were plotted over a  <dig> day period . for the undifferentiated cells, ndpkb/nm23h <dig> cells had significantly fewer cells as compared to control, whereas diva/bclb cells had a peak in cell numbers at  <dig> days after plating. however, by  <dig> days all the transfected cells had similar cell numbers, plausibly due to space constraints in the well. the growth curves for all the differentiated transfected cells were attenuated, indicating a slower proliferation rate as compared to the undifferentiated cells. there was a significant increase in cell number of diva/bclb cells as compared to control cells only  <dig> days after induction of differentiation. the growth curve for ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpressing cells was slightly slower than the control cells when under differentiating conditions, but statistical analysis showed no significant difference.

in order to study the effects of both proteins on serum-induced cell cycle re-entry, the transfected cells were serum starved for  <dig> hours to arrest and synchronize them, before serum was added again to allow cell cycle re-entry. at stipulated time points after re-addition of serum, the cells were stained with propidium iodide and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. both diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpressing cells had significantly lower percentages of apoptotic cells . there was a delay in progression from g <dig> to s-phase for the ndpkb/nm23h <dig> cells  and there was a significant s-phase population only at 24hrs . the g2/m population for ndpkb/nm23h <dig> cells was consistently smaller than the control cells . in contrast, the diva/bclb cells had a considerably larger s-phase population than the control at  <dig> and  <dig> hrs . interestingly, at  <dig> hours, there was a greater proportion of diva-overexpressing cells at s-phase, and a lower percentage in the g2/m phase, as compared to the control cells . hence, it might signify that diva has a role in s-phase.

discussion
thus far, reports on diva/bclb have only covered its role in apoptosis and oocyte maturation  <cit> . the results in this study propose a novel function for diva/bclb, by demonstrating that the protein is involved in the negative regulation of neuronal differentiation, and that it achieves this by inhibiting ndpkb/nm23h <dig> function.

in this study, we showed that with ngf-induced differentiation, diva/bclb expression decreases and ndpkb expression increases. the regulation of these  <dig> proteins is likely through the sustained erk signalling by ngf, which results in phosphorylation as well as binding of creb and ap- <dig> family members so as to facilitate gene transcription  <cit> .

overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> encouraged pc <dig> neuronal differentiation by promoting neurite outgrowth and retarding cell proliferation. interestingly, there was diva/bclb downregulation in the ndpkb/nm23h <dig> overexpressing cells, which is a salient point since decreased expression of diva/bclb was also observed during ngf-induced differentiation. thus, this supported that diva/bclb was a negative modulator of neuronal differentiation that had to be downregulated and suggested that the induced downregulation of diva/bclb by ndpkb/nm23h <dig> could be a positive feedback mechanism for ngf-induced neuronal differentiation.

overexpression of diva suppressed ndpkb/nm23h <dig> function by retaining ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the cytoplasm, and attenuated the number of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes. in turn, there was an increase in s-phase cells and shorter neurites were observed after ngf-induced neuronal differentiation.

the regulatory molecules that control the rate of neurite growth and the signals that determine when and where the axons and dendrites have to grow are still largely unknown. overexpression of negative regulators of neuronal differentiation have been shown to block neurite outgrowth and branching by inhibiting the erk/mapk and rac <dig> but not akt signaling pathway in response to ngf  <cit> . in our study, diva/bclb inhibited neurite outgrowth as more diva/bclb and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> as well as diva/bclb and β-tubulin complexes were formed and the amount of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes decreased significantly. previous reports have reported the co-immunoprecipitation of ndpk/nm <dig> with β-tubulin, and the number of complexes increases during the cellular differentiation process  <cit> . tubulin phosphorylation by ndpkb/nm23h <dig> would allow the microtubules to attach more efficiently to the maps and increase microtubule stability, thereby facilitating neurite outgrowth  <cit> . therefore, this study suggests that the physiological role of diva/bclb in undifferentiated cells might be to inhibit the association between ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin. expression of diva/bclb is downregulated during differentiation to allow more ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes to form, thereby encouraging neurite outgrowth. this is interesting since diva/bclb has been shown to interact with hungtington-interacting protein 1-related  protein and microtubule binding protein, translationally controlled tumor-associated protein  and thereby postulated to regulate the cytoskeleton  <cit> . our study has plugged the gap to show regulation of the cytoskeleton by diva/bclb and its consequential effect on neurite outgrowth.

in differentiated cells, the overexpression of diva/bclb in pc- <dig> cells resulted in intense immunostaining in the cytoplasm, indicating the colocalisation of the  <dig> proteins, and significantly decreased the number of cells with ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in their nucleus. this suggests that overexpression of diva/bclb was able to sequester ndpkb/nm23h <dig> in the cytoplasm and prevent its translocation into the cytoplasm after receiving the signal for differentiation. this is interesting because overexpression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> results in nuclear expression and decreased cellular proliferation. in contrast, the effect of overexpressing diva/bclb is a higher proliferation rate and decreased nuclear expression of ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  hence, this suggests that diva/bclb is able to regulate proliferation by controlling the nuclear translocation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig>  ndpks have been reported to translocate to the nucleus, although there is controversy whether ndpka/nm23h <dig> and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> visit the nucleus together or separately  <cit> . also, reasons for ndpkb/nm23h <dig> movement into the nucleus are also unclear, though the translocation has been observed to occur at certain cell phase cycles, thereby suggesting ndpk/nm <dig> are required in the nucleus for gene regulation or to supply dntps for replication  <cit> . ndpkb/nm23h <dig> has been identified as human transcription factor puf, a sequence-specific dna-binding protein with affinity for a nuclease-hypersensitive element  of the c-myc gene promoter  <cit> . ndpkb/nm23h <dig> has also been demonstrated to be capable of dna binding, dna cleavage, as well as transcriptional activity that is independent of phosphoryl transfer and ndpk activity  <cit> . thus, we report a novel observation of the translocation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> into the nucleus after differentiation, which causes inhibition of proliferation and retarded cell cycle progression, although the exact mechanisms are yet to be further elucidated.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results present a model in which downregulation of diva/bclb during differentiation is necessary to allow increased formation of ndpkb/nm23h <dig> and β-tubulin complexes for neurite outgrowth, and for ndpkb/nm23h <dig> to enter the nucleus to inhibit proliferation. hence this clarifies the developmental observation for the increased ndpkb/nm23h <dig> expression seen during the onset of organogenesis in the brain  <cit> , as well as explains the attenuated diva/bclb expression in the adult brain  <cit> . development of the nervous system is a complex process, and the correct expression of diva and ndpkb/nm23h <dig> proteins are important in ensuring regulation of diverse cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation and synaptogenesis.
