BACKGROUND
the family fagaceae includes more than  <dig> species in nine genera  <cit>  found in temperate, subtropical, and tropical regions of the world  <cit> . in the western hemisphere, the fagaceae range from southern canada to colombia  <cit>  where they grow as tall trees or, occasionally, as shrubs. the fagaceae include major species such as chestnuts, oaks, and beeches  <cit> . the fagaceae have significant ecological and economic value. they are predominant species of most hardwood forests in the northern hemisphere. nuts of fagus , castanea , quercus  and most castanopsis species are important sources of food for forest animals and produce a high quality extractable oil  <cit> . the fagaceae are important as a timber resource for construction, telephone poles, floors, furniture, cabinets, and other applications. american chestnut played an especially important economic and ecological role by providing food to various insects, birds, and mammals, and food, fiber, and wood for rural communities, prior to the introduction of the chestnut blight disease  early in the 20th century  <cit> .

fossil dating reveals that species of the order fagales existed  <dig> million years ago   <cit> . the time of divergence of the families of the fagales has been estimated to be as early as  <dig> mya  <cit> . fagaceae species hold a key position in the phylogeny of angiosperms ; they cluster closely to cucurbitales in the eurosid i group, which includes several model plant species, such as medicago truncatula, glycine max, populus trichocarpa, and eucalyptus grandis for which complete or nearly complete whole-genome sequences exist. the close phylogenetic relationships of several model plants should make members of the fagaceae good models for comparative genomics between woody and herbaceous species.

this paper reports on further analysis of the transcriptome of chestnut and the identification of candidate genes involved in the defense against cbd. the coverage of the transcriptome was analyzed for number of genes identified, sequence length, gene family size, and similarity to the transcriptome of other woody and herbaceous species. the transcript contigs include full length coding sequences from american and chinese chestnut respectively which represents a valuable resource for genomic studies in the fagaceae. the analysis of the differential transcript abundance  of chestnut genes using degseq  <cit>  allowed the identification of hundreds of defense related candidate genes with dta in canker versus healthy stem tissues. a small set of candidate genes for resistance to cbd were verified for their dta using real time quantitative rt-pcr.

RESULTS
sequencing summary
more than  <dig>  million  reads were generated corresponding to  <dig> million nucleotides of cdna sequences from the two studied species. transcript contigs were assembled from the pyrosequencing reads using newbler software  and designated version  <dig> on the fagaceae website  <cit> . a second assembly, performed on sequences generated from both pyrosequencing and capillary sequencing reads using seqman™ ngen™ v <dig>  software , was designated version  <dig>  the version  <dig> contig set included longer contigs and more sequences were integrated into the contigs when compared to the original  <dig> newbler assemblies. the combination of sanger sequences and  <dig> sequences also resulted in slightly fewer but longer contigs. general information about the sequences and contigs identified from each species are summarized .

analysis of the american and chinese chestnut transcriptomes
for the two fagaceae species in this study, over one and half million sequencing reads were generated and yielded a total of  <dig>  contigs in total for the separate assemblies of the cdna libraries for the  <dig> tissues sampled. a small fraction of contigs matched mitochondrial  and chloroplast  genes. similarly, ~ <dig> % of american and chinese chestnut sequences obtained from canker tissues had best blastx alignments to the cryphonectria parasitica proteome. transcriptome assembly, version  <dig> , led to the identification of  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs from american and chinese chestnut respectively, from pyrosequencing alone, and  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, with the addition of the sanger sequences for american chestnut and chinese chestnut, respectively . go annotation using the arabidopsis thaliana proteome as reference showed that the transcriptome of these species covers a wide range of biological processes  suggesting that the cdna libraries were unbiased and well-suited for studies of development and physiology. the distribution of biological processes of the identified contigs from american and chinese chestnut  did not show any statistically significant differences   <cit> . blastx alignments to model system proteomes showed that ~ 60% of the transcript contig sequences from the chestnut species studied have strong similarity to predicted proteins in arabidopsis thaliana or populus trichocarpa. of the contig sequences that did not have any significant matches to arabidopsis thaliana genes,  <dig> to 6% had a match to populus trichocarpa genes. the remaining contigs  did not match any sequence in either the arabidopsis thaliana or populus trichocarpa proteomes. we observed a bias toward longer sequences in the contigs with blastx alignments to the model proteomes. the distribution of contig length showed that ~85% of sequences without blastx alignments to the proteomes of the two model species were short . in contrast, only about 50% of contigs with good blastx hits on the model species proteomes were shorter than  <dig> nt.

blastx searches were then conducted against the proteomes of all of the plant species for which the whole genome sequence were available at the time of this study, including vitis vinifera, carica papaya, medicago truncatula, oryza sativa, populus trichocarpa, physcomitrella patens, and selaginella moellendorffii. a large fraction of chestnut contigs had better blast alignment scores to woody species than to the herbaceous species . for instance, over 35% of contigs from american and chinese chestnut had best alignments to vitis vinifera and populus trichocarpa. only ~5% of the contigs had best alignments to arabidopsis thaliana. this bias cannot be attributed to a gc content difference between contigs from woody versus herbaceous species as their gc content have similar distributions .

coverage of the transcriptomes
from the  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, a total of  <dig>  and  <dig>  large transcript contigs  were identified from american chestnut and chinese chestnut, respectively. the size of the transcript contigs assembled including large ones ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig> bp with approx. 4-12% of the american and chinese chestnut contigs covering at least 70% of the length of the coding sequences relative to the respective genes in arabidopsis thaliana. analyses of the length of contigs showed that  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs were full length in american chestnut and chinese chestnut, respectively. analysis of gene family size, both in american and chinese chestnut as well as in populus trichocarpa, arabidopsis thaliana, and oryza sativa, showed that the numbers of genes per family identified in chestnuts is similar to their counterpart in the model plant species suggesting a good coverage of the transcriptome in these two fagaceae species . for instance, the number of members per gene family correlates well between american chestnut, chinese chestnut, and the other model plant species , with correlations coefficients of r =  <dig>  for chinese chestnut versus arabidopsis and r =  <dig>  for chinese chestnut versus populus.

defense related genes in american and chinese chestnut
in silico analysis of transcript abundance using the degseq approach  <cit>  identified  <dig> gdta in canker tissues versus healthy stems in american chestnut and  <dig> g dta in chinese chestnut . the number of reads per transcript contig ranged between  <dig> and  <dig> in canker and between  <dig> and  <dig> in healthy stem tissues. go annotation distribution  showed that  <dig> and  <dig> of the identified genes from american and chinese chestnut, respectively, were involved in response to abiotic or biotic stimuli. twenty two percent and twenty three percent of american chestnut and chinese chestnut genes from this functional category were involved in defense against biotic stresses. most of the gene transcripts were highly abundant in canker tissues of both species  and thus represent good candidates for defense against the cbd fungus. go annotation distribution  showed that the most frequent molecular functions of the identified defense-related genes were hydrolases, protein binding, transferases, and transporters. several annotation categories including "secondary metabolic process", "oxidoreductase", "cellulose and pectin-containing cell wall", "hydrolases", and "lyases activity" were significantly over-represented in chinese than american chestnut. a statistical analysis using the gostat program  <cit>  confirmed the enrichment of chinese chestnut transcritpome in these functional categories . on the opposite, several functional categories including mainly house-keeping genes such "structural constituent of the ribosome", "translation", "ribosome biogenesis and assembly", and "protein metabolic process" were over-represented in american chestnut than chinese chestnut . the over-representation of house-keeping gdtas in american chestnut could be associated with the increase in protein synthesis at the infection site for defense against the pathogen.

the list of the identified defense-related genes showing dta involves several related pathways . the first category includes genes involved in the biosynthesis of lignin and other cell wall components such as 4-coumarate:coa ligase , cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase , cinnamoyl coa reductase , peroxidase, myb transcription factor, and udp-glucose:thiohydroximate s-glucosyltransferase. genes involved in programmed cell death and hypersensitivity such as myo-inositol-1-phosphate, atpase transporter, voltage-dependent anion channel, 2-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate, and cysteine proteinase precursor-like protein were also identified in canker tissues. however, one of the highly represented categories was phytohormone signaling including ethylene, jasmonic acid , salicyc acid , and abscisic acid  . for example, transcripts of  <dig> genes involved in ja response were differentially abundant in chinese chestnut. these include allene oxide cyclase, jaz <dig>  lipoxygenase, 12-oxophytodienoate reductase, 3-ketoacyl-coa thiolase, chitinase, plastidic fatty acid desaturase, and others. lipooxygenase, chitinase, and acc oxidase are among genes with the most dta in canker versus healthy stem . genes involved in the response to sa include alpha-dioxygenase, mitochondrial chaperonin hsp, senescence-associated gene, and others. genes related to the aba response include aba 8'-hydroxylase, 26s proteasome regulatory subunit, protein phosphatase  <dig> c, hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-diphosphate  synthase and others. several other genes involved were identified such as myb transcription factors, proteases, and kinases. comparison of gdtas from american and chinese chestnut showed that similar set of genes were induced in american and chinese chestnut . few genes were induced in american versus chinese and vice versa . analyses of a small set of these candidate genes using quantitative rt-pcr in healthy stem tissue versus cryphonectria parasitica inoculated stem tissues from american and chinese chestnut confirmed the differential expression of several of these candidates .

discussion
in this study, over  <dig>  million sequencing reads from various tissues were generated and assembled into  <dig>  and  <dig>  contigs, for american and chinese chestnut respectively. the low level of contamination with organelle dna, the fraction of complete or nearly complete full length cdna sequences, and the depth coverage of genes involved in various biological processes indicate that pyrosequencing is an excellent tool for gene discovery, est sequencing, and transcriptome analysis in non-model tree species. combining  <dig> and sanger sequences can improve contig construction as the assembly using both data sets resulted in more reads being integrated into contigs than by assembly of pyrosequences alone, resulting in slightly fewer but longer contig sequences. using a tool developed recently  <cit> , that estimates the amount of sequencing needed to cover the transcriptome of a given species, that takes into consideration the sequencing platform and the number of contigs generated from each species, we determined that as few as two or three additional plates of  <dig> sequence from different developmental stages and physiological conditions should allow for 100% coverage of the transcriptomes of chinese and american chestnut.

the sequencing effort of the gtdf increased the number of fagaceae cdnas available in genbank from a few sequences to hundreds of thousands of sequences for each of the species studied. the cdna sequences and contig sequences, which are publicly accessible at the website  <cit>  hosted at clemson university, provides tools for fagaceae species-specific blast searches. the cdna sequences have been used to select molecular markers such as simple sequence repeats , and single nucleotide polymorphisms  for genetic mapping in chinese and american chestnut , for ordering the physical map of chinese chestnut , and for characterizing micrornas . the sequences were also used to identify candidate genes involved in resistance to cbd  <cit> , some of which are being functionally characterized . the genes with dta were also being examined for colocalization with qtls for resistance to cbd.

blastx alignments to the proteomes of two model systems  showed that ~ 60% of the transcript contig sequences from the fagaceae species studied have strong similarity to predicted proteins. the remaining contigs did not match any sequence in the arabidopsis or populus proteomes. a large fraction of these are short sequences that may originate from 3' or 5' untranslated regions, which tend to be highly divergent between species . part of these sequences may also correspond to non-coding rnas, or potential chestnut-specific genes. blast searches against the proteomes of eight plant species with complete genome sequences  showed that a large fraction of the fagaceae contigs have better alignments with genes in woody species such as vitis vinifera, populus trichocarpa, and carica papaya versus the non-woody species angiosperm species. similar results have been reported for other tree species such as liriodendron tulipifera and carica papaya  <cit> . many long-lived woody plants, including fagaceae species, exhibit extended phases of juvenile development before they reach flowering age, whereas most herbaceous plants reach flowering age in a single growing season. thus, these observations could be associated with a slower evolutionary rate of genes in woody species versus herbaceous species.

in silico analysis of gene expression identified over two fold gdtas in american than chinese chestnut. however, most of the difference between the two dgta sets lies in the number of induced housekeeping genes associated with the increase in resource utilization for plant defense at the infection site. the difference in the number of house-keeping genes induced in american and chinese is maybe due to the amplitude of response of the two species to c. parasitica infection. the number of genes belonging to the category "response to biotic and abiotic stimuli" in american and chinese chestnut from this is over  <dig> and  <dig> times higher than the ones reported previously using a partial dataset  <cit> . also, several genes identified previously were not confirmed in this analysis. however, many new genes with dta were identified in this study. the discrepancy between these results is linked to the larger dataset, which includes both  <dig> and capillary sequences, the better contig assembly, and the use of a more powerful tool for dta analysis.

genes with dta identified in this study belong to well known plant pathways such as phenylpropanoid metabolism, phytohormone  signaling, cell wall biosynthesis, proteolysis, and others. these genes and pathways function at different times in the plant response to pathogens. the category of genes involved in phenylpropanoid metabolism act early in plant defense, serving to inhibit or to block the penetration and the progression of the plant pathogen. this category includes genes for biosynthesis of monolignol and other phenolic compounds. previous studies  <cit>  showed that lignin biosynthesis is crucial for cell wall apposition, one of the first lines of plant defense against invading fungi. besides lignin, the biosynthesis of other polymers such as callose seems to follow infection as suggested by the increased transcript abundance of udp-glucose:thiohydroximate s-glucosyltransferase  <cit> . other phenolic products that are involved in plant defense against pest and pathogens seem to be produced as well, as deduced by the presence of transcripts encoding genes such as flavanone 3-hydroxylase and flavonol 7-o-glucosyltransferase known to regulate flavonoid biosynthesis  <cit> .

the second most important category of genes detected in response to the blight infection includes genes from phytohormone signaling pathways including ja, sa, and ethylene. these hormones trigger the activation of induced systemic resistance and systemic acquired resistance  to nectrotrophic pathogens  <cit> . the sar is an effective defense mechanism against a broad range of pathogens and insects. several genes from the ja response pathway such as methyl jasmonate esterase , acyl-coa oxidase, a phyb pathway, and atpase transporter were identified  <cit> . genes involved in sa response such as hydroxy-2-methyl-2--butenyl 4-diphosphate, hopw1-1-interacting protein  <dig>  were identified  <cit> . the sa pathway, which is considered one of the major pathways involved in defense against nectrotrophic pathogens, regulates the expression of defense effector genes and systemic acquired resistance through the repression of the auxin signaling pathway  <cit> . another hormone that seems to play a role in the resistance of chestnut to cbd is abscissic acid . while aba was described as a susceptibility factor, other studies  <cit>  showed that it activates plant defense by priming for callose deposition or by restricting the progression of the fungus cochliobolus miyabeanus in the mesophyll of rice  <cit> . other signaling genes involved in sar that induce numerous defense genes include apoplastic lipid transfer protein, and basic chitinase, etc  <cit> .

the third category of genes with dta in canker tissues includes genes involved in early response as part of the hr. among these are transcripts encoding proteins such as atpase transporter, kinases, carbonic anhydrase, ammecr <dig>  mips <dig>  voltage-dependent anion channel, 2-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate  synthase, and glutathione peroxidase that were reported previously to be involved in the hypersensitivity resistance  and cell death in plants under pathogenic attack  <cit> . reactive oxygen species  seem to be induced following c. parasitica infection as several genes involved in oxidative stress , cytosolic ascorbate peroxidase apx1) had more abundant transcripts. furthermore, several pathogenesis related  genes such as elicitor-activated gene 3- <dig> , aromatic alcohol:nadp + oxidoreductase, thaumatin, pathogenesis-related, and antifungal chitin-binding protein had differentially abundant transcripts in canker versus healthy stem tissues. pr proteins, of which some have antimicrobial functions  <cit> , are mainly induced in localized pathogen attack around hr lesions. it is unknown what roles the hr and cell death play for chestnut defense against a necrotrophic pathogen such as c. parasitica. alternatively, some of the genes involved in the hr may activate a systemic response of the plant or the pathogen may trigger hr to facilitate its colonization of the plant as reported for other pathogens  <cit> . several other genes involved in defense such as eif4e  <cit>  were also implicated.

the candidate genes identified in this study represent a valuable resource for studying the genetic basis underlying resistance to cbd and the isolation of the fungal pathogen resistance genes. comparative mapping of the blight resistance quantitative trait loci  of chestnut with peach disease resistance qtl is revealing that the genes for several of the differentially abundant chestnut transcripts in canker versus healthy stem tissues map to disease resistance qtl regions in both species . this suggests that some of the genes identified in this study may play a major role in plant defense against the cbd. because most of the defense genes and gene networks were induced in both american and chinese chestnut canker tissues, the question that remains is what then accounts for one of these species being susceptible and the other resistant to cbd. the timing of the response to the pathogen infection, and the amplitude of the response, could result in chinese chestnut resistance to the blight. more information from transcript profiling during the time course of infection in these two species is required to address this question.

CONCLUSIONS
this project has generated over  <dig>  transcript contigs from american and chinese chestnuts and identified hundreds of genes and regulation pathways which may be involved in chestnut resistance to the pathogen c. parasitica. these resources have also been used for snp and ssr marker development, genetic mapping, physical mapping, and genome organization comparison among chestnut species and between chestnut and other closely related species. several of the candidate genes identified in this study are in the process of being analyzed for their function using transformation in planta. the cdna database generated in this project is also being used to map expressed genes and to annotate the proteome in the chinese chestnut genome that is being assembled during submission of this report .
