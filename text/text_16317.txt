BACKGROUND
somatic cells protect themselves from damage during cellular stress inducing so called heat shock response, which results in heat shock proteins  synthesis. there are many different hsps classified to families based on molecular weight and sequence homology. in mammalian cells there are five major classes of hsp families, namely the hsph , hspc , hspa , dnaj  and hspb , and two chaperonin families: hspd/e  and cct   <cit> . generally, hsps prevent inappropriate protein aggregation and mediate transport of immature proteins to the target organelles for final packaging, degradation or repair. although some members of hsps are expressed constitutively in the absence of stress or during gametogenesis and embryogenesis  <cit> , many of them accumulate to a high level in cells subjected to different types of stress stimuli and remain elevated for a prolonged period  <cit> . heat shock factor  <dig>  is the primary transcription factor responsible for the activation of hsp genes following stress. in physiological conditions hsf <dig> exists as an inactive monomer. activation of hsf <dig> in response to cellular stress is connected with its trimerization, phosphorylation and binding to dna in the promoter regions containing the heat shock elements , which are present mainly in heat shock genes  <cit> . in addition to the regulation of hsp genes, hsf <dig> is involved in the transcription of numerous other genes, both in the absence or presence of heat shock. in saccharomyces or drosophila the direct transcriptional targets of hsf represent nearly 3% of genes  <cit> . these genes encode for proteins involved in diverse cellular processes such as rna splicing, apoptosis, ubiquitinylation and protein degradation, detoxification, energy generation, carbohydrate metabolism, small molecule transport, cell signaling and maintenance of cell integrity  <cit> .

despite the high degree of conservation of the heat shock response, different cells vary in their ability to induce hsps synthesis and consequently in sensitivity to damaging agents. hsps overexpression in various human cancers diminishes the success of anti-cancer treatment by increasing the resistance of cancer cells to therapy  <cit> . on the other hand, some neurons, pre-ovulatory oocytes, spermatocytes and some stages of embryonic development  <cit> , as well as certain tumor cell lines , are hypersensitive to elevated temperatures. it has been shown, at least for spermatocytes, that inducible hsp <dig> expression is blocked in such cells  <cit> . opposite to most somatic cells, in which hsf <dig> is a part of the cytoprotective system, in spermatocytes it acts as a pro-apoptotic factor  <cit> . moreover, the testis-specific variant of hsp <dig> is depleted in cells undergoing hsf1-induced apoptosis  <cit> . activation of hsf <dig> in male germ cells induces massive degeneration of a seminiferous epithelium, which leads to male infertility  <cit> . in fact, primary spermatocytes are germ cells the most sensitive to heat stress  <cit> . spermatocytes are very unique cells. they originate from spermatogonia and divide by meiosis giving haploid spermatids   <cit> . during the whole process of spermatogenesis dramatic changes in patterns of gene expression and chromatin structure are observed. in particular, the first meiotic division  involves many cell-specific gene products. they are needed for correct processing of chromosome condensation, pairing of homologous chromosomes, formation of the synaptonemal complexes, and genetic recombination. these unique processes should be highly orchestrated and any disturbances at that stage of spermatogenesis could lead to fertility problems  <cit> .

in the majority of mammals, the male gonads are located outside the main body cavity to provide the lower testicular temperature required for correct spermatogenesis and fertility. increasing of the testis temperature up to the body temperature  leads to the activation of hsf <dig>  <cit> . active hsf <dig> acts as a cell-survival factor only in pre-meiotic germ cells, but not in meiotic and post-meiotic ones  <cit> . both mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-dependent pathways appear to be involved in the hsf1-induced apoptosis of spermatogenic cells: the levels of bcl- <dig> family proteins is increased, p <dig> protein accumulates and expression levels of caspase- <dig> and death-receptor-interacting proteins  are elevated  <cit> . the apoptosis of spermatocytes induced by hsf <dig> can be an important mechanism involved in the removal of aberrant germ cells. this can prevent maturation of damaged male germ cells and transmission of incorrect genetic information to the next generation.

transcriptional activity of hsf <dig> is apparently indispensable in its pro-apoptotic functions within spermatocytes. however, details of molecular mechanisms involved in activation of hsf1-triggered apoptosis of male germ cells are not known at present. we performed studies that aimed to disclose the initiating events leading to apoptosis of male germ cells after temperature elevation. for this purpose, the genome-wide transcriptional analysis was performed both in control and heat-shocked cells, either isolated mouse spermatocytes or hepatocytes representing somatic cells, using the affymetrix genechip system. genes that are differently expressed after hyperthermia in both types of cells have been identified. to find out genes directly regulated by hsf <dig>  the chromatin immunoprecipitation assay combined with dna microarray  was performed. this approach enabled the identification of genes targeted by this transcription factor, in either somatic or male germ cells.

RESULTS
differences in transcriptional response to hyperthermia between somatic and spermatogenic cells
the physiological temperature for mouse testes  is approximately 32-33°c. increasing the testicular temperature up to 37°c and above does not induce cytoprotective mechanisms, as it is observed in somatic cells during hyperthermia, but leads to the degeneration of seminiferous epithelium  <cit> . aiming to decipher the differences in molecular mechanisms induced by heat shock in mouse somatic and spermatogenic cells we applied the strategy which is schematically illustrated in figure  <dig>  in the first step, we performed the global gene expression profiling using affymetrix microarrays in control and heat shocked cells. as model somatic cells we used hepatocytes that respond to hyperthermia in a classical way by induction of heat shock genes transcription . as spermatogenic cells we used a fraction of cells enriched with spermatocytes , which are the most sensitive to damage at elevated temperatures  <cit> . using isolated spermatocytes we avoided the influence of the somatic testicular component in the final results. we took advantage of hsp genes as reference genes to monitor response to heat shock, and observed strong induction of hspa <dig>  hspa <dig> and hsph <dig> genes transcription two to six hours after hyperthermia in the liver and in whole testes, but not in the fraction of isolated spermatocytes . this result is consistent with previous findings that mrnas of major heat shock genes are hardly induced in vivo in response to heat shock in male germ cells  <cit> . on affymetrix gene chip arrays we analyzed rna isolated from untreated  hepatocytes and after  <dig> h of recovery at the physiological temperature from heat shock performed at 43°c. in the case of spermatocytes, rna was isolated from untreated cells and after  <dig> h of recovery at the physiological temperature from heat shock performed at 38°c or 43°c.

to exclude from analyses genes with very low levels of expression thresholds of signals  were calculated . expression levels of  <dig>  <dig> genes with signals above the noise threshold level registered in at least one experimental point are presented in additional file  <dig> <cit> . changes in the level of genes expression in heat-shocked  samples versus control, untreated , are presented as a signal log ratio . for each experimental group significant slr was calculated, and genes affected by hyperthermia in spermatocytes and hepatocytes were found . the analysis revealed that global changes in the levels of expression in spermatocytes were smaller  than in hepatocytes . however, in spermatocytes subjected to hyperthermia at 38°c many more genes were affected than in hepatocytes . importantly, while in hepatocytes the number of up- and down-regulated genes was comparable, in spermatocytes significantly more genes were inhibited than up-regulated.

changes of expression are shown as slrs. “total” includes all genes with signal above noise at least in one experimental point .

the ten top genes with the highest induction of the transcription after hyperthermia are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig>  <cit> . approximately 30% of genes activated in spermatocytes subjected to heat shock at 38°c  were expressed in hepatocytes at a very low level . in turn, almost 40% encode for proteins with an unknown function. cluster analysis and the gene to go bp  test showed that, among activated genes, those involved in negative regulation of different biological processes are over-represented . importantly, activation of gene expression was rather marginal in spermatocytes subjected to heat shock at 43°c . genes that were induced in hepatocytes following hyperthermia  were usually not up-regulated in spermatocytes, and for 20% of them the level of expression in spermatocytes was below the noise threshold. the noted exception was activation of hspa <dig> gene in both hepatocytes and spermatocytes , which suggests that the isolated fraction of spermatogenic cells might be slightly contaminated by somatic cells. as expected, the gene to go bp test for over-representation revealed that genes grouped in clusters with the highest degree of induction in hepatocytes are involved mainly in processes corresponding to the stress response and protein folding. strongly activated genes are also associated with inflammatory response, cytokine production and t cell activation .

the ten top genes with the highest inhibition of the transcription following hyperthermia are shown in additional file 7: table s <dig>  <cit> . among genes down-regulated in spermatocytes following heat shock at 38°c  a large portion  was not expressed in hepatocytes, and uncharacterized genes represented about 10%. cluster analysis and the gene to go bp test showed that among genes down-regulated in spermatocytes at 38°c strongly over-represented are those involved in rna metabolism, cellular process involved in reproduction, regulation of gene expression and signal transduction . in spermatocytes subjected to hyperthermia at 43°c inhibition of the transcription was more prominent than activation, although it was weaker than in cells treated at 38°c. down regulation of genes involved in response to heat and response to oxidative stress was the most characteristic . genes down-regulated in heat shocked hepatocytes  are involved in lipid, steroid and isoprenoid metabolism, catabolic processes and oxidation-reduction processes ; 30% of such genes showed very low level of expression in spermatocytes . it should be also noted that for genes with the highest repression following the hyperthermia of hepatocytes the big differences in the level of expression between samples were observed , which makes this group less conclusive.

our expression data indicated that responses of spermatocytes to hyperthermia at 38°c and at 43°c were quantitatively and qualitatively different. it was previously suggested that heat shock at 43°c resulted rather in rapid changes of the protein localization than their levels . hence, comparison of changes induced in hepatocytes treated at 43°c with changes induced in spermatocytes treated at 38°c appeared more relevant .

both hepatocytes and spermatocytes showed significant differences in the transcriptional response to stress, and only a few genes responded similarly . the majority of genes affected by hyperthermia were differentially regulated in hepatocytes and spermatocytes. as expected, hsp genes and some other genes coding for proteins that enable recovery from stress were strongly induced in hepatocytes, but not in spermatocytes. furthermore, some hsp genes were strongly down-regulated in spermatocytes, although there were also examples of chaperones’ expression activation .

the level of expression in spermatocytes  and in hepatocytes  is given in arbitrary units in logarithmic scale . changes in gene expression following heat shock  are shown as slrs.

expression of several genes encoding proteins involved  in cell death was differentially regulated in both types of cells . genes coding for proteins with proved anti-apoptotic properties  were strongly activated only in hepatocytes. in spermatocytes some genes involved in regulation of apoptosis were repressed . it is noteworthy that expression of pyhin <dig>  which possibly promote ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of mdm <dig> leading to tp <dig> stabilization  <cit> , was observed only in spermatocytes. this is consistent with the observation that p <dig> was accumulated in the testes of transgenic mice expressing active hsf <dig>  <cit> .

during the heat shock response expression of genes coding for some transcriptional regulators involved in the growth, proliferation and differentiation was strongly activated in hepatocytes, but not in spermatocytes . in spermatocytes, a different set of transcriptional regulators was activated . in spermatocytes numerous transcriptional regulators were repressed, e.g. some components of general transcription factors machinery . some of the transcription factors, whose mrnas were elevated in hepatocytes during the heat shock response, play a role in the inflammatory responses . consistently, some other genes involved in the inflammatory and immune responses were significantly up-regulated in hepatocytes .

data obtained from microarrays analyses were further verified and visualized by semi-quantitative rt-pcr on independent material. expression of selected genes was analyzed in isolated spermatocytes, and in whole testes and liver, after  <dig> h,  <dig> h,  <dig> h and  <dig> h of recovery from heat shock. these analyses revealed that the level of transcripts strongly elevated after hyperthermia at 43°c in somatic cells  returned to the steady-state level  <dig> h after treatment . analyses confirmed also a lack of activation of hsp genes  in isolated spermatocytes up to  <dig> h after treatment. rt-pcr analyses generally confirmed data obtained from microarrays studies.

differences in hsf <dig> binding to dna between somatic and spermatogenic cells
hsf <dig> is activated at elevated temperatures very rapidly, and the strongest hsf <dig> binding to dna was observed after 2– <dig> minutes of heat shock treatment, depending on experimental model  <cit> . to find out the optimal conditions of hsf <dig> binding in our experimental system we first analyzed by chip-pcr the ability of hsf <dig> to bind to promoters of hsph <dig>  hspa <dig>  dnaja <dig> and phlda <dig> . binding of hsf <dig> was analyzed after  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes of incubation of cells at elevated temperatures. isolated hepatocytes were incubated at 43°c. isolated spermatocytes were incubated at 38°c or 43°c. observed hsf <dig> binding varied depending on the gene and conditions of heat shock . in spermatocytes during heat shock at 38°c the hsf <dig> binding was generally much weaker than at 43°c , and a prolonged period of hyperthermia  did not straighten hsf <dig> binding. interestingly, in the case of hspa <dig> genes, the most activated genes during heat shock in somatic cells, we observed only moderate hsf <dig> binding to the promoters in hepatocytes . in further in-depth chip on chip studies our goal was not study of the kinetics of hsf <dig> binding but finding the broadest spectrum of its targets. thus chromatin immunoprecipitation was done on cells heat shocked for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> minutes, than combined in one sample. chip on chip analyses were performed on affymetrix mouse promoter tiling arrays to find out the molecular targets of hsf <dig> in all promoter regions. untreated cells  and cells subjected to hyperthermia  were analyzed, and the mean signals  for each probeset on the array have been calculated in samples with antibody  and in samples without antibody . binding of hsf <dig> was assessed as ab1-ab <dig> value. an example of analysis showing the graphical representation of ab1-ab <dig> signals from each probeset distributed on promoters is shown in figure  <dig>  finally, numerical value estimating hsf <dig> binding was calculated in arbitrary units for each promoter . results of such analyzes obtained for each promoter are presented in additional file  <dig> <cit>  .

searching for hsf <dig> binding at the normal physiological temperature in spermatocytes we found only a few genes with statistically significant signals , while in hepatocytes there was no such genes . chip on chip analyzes revealed that following hyperthermia promoters of several hsp genes and some other genes already known to be regulated by hsf <dig>  <cit> , interact with hsf <dig> in both hepatocytes and spermatocytes . in this group of genes, binding of hsf <dig> at the physiological temperature was detected only to the hsph <dig> and hsp90ab <dig> promoters, although the significance of the signal was only marginal . in general, heat shock strongly induced hsf <dig> binding . interestingly, hsf <dig> interacted with more genes in spermatocytes than in hepatocytes, although in hepatocytes the binding was stronger . more than 50% of genes interacting with hsf <dig> in hepatocytes, were bound by hsf <dig> also in spermatocytes . interestingly, in hepatocytes  the uppermost hsf <dig> binding following heat shock was observed for sequences located on the chromosome y . genes showing the uppermost hsf <dig> binding in spermatocytes also showed strong binding in hepatocytes . the gene to go bp test showed that genes bound by hsf <dig> in both hepatocytes and spermatocytes have the strongest representation in following classes: rna processing and transport, dna replication, repair, recombination and chromatin modification, protein folding, translation and ubiquitination, golgi organization, zinc ion transport and microtubule cytoskeleton. as could be expected, hsf1-bound genes involved in spermatogenesis, meiosis and mitosis  have much higher representation in spermatocytes than in hepatocytes .

correlation between hsf <dig> binding and modulation of gene expression during heat shock
in the next step of analysis, we selected genes that both were bound by hsf <dig> and whose expression was changed in cells subjected to hyperthermia. we found significant changes of expression only in a fraction of genes that interacted with hsf <dig> . in general, the binding of hsf <dig> was correlated with an activation of the transcription in hepatocytes and with a repression in spermatocytes . top hsf1-bound genes induced or repressed in spermatocytes and hepatocytes following heat shock are shown in table  <dig> . in the selected genes hsf <dig> binding was usually observed both in hepatocytes and in spermatocytes. nevertheless, similar hsf <dig> binding did not result in similar changes in expression when both types of cells were compared. even in spermatocytes subjected to hyperthermia at 38°c and 43°c, hsf1-bound genes were differentially regulated after heat shock. this finding suggests that factors responsible for hsf <dig> activation are not only cell-type specific, but also dependent on the temperature. we also searched for a general statistical correlation between hyperthermia-induced changes in gene expression and hsf <dig> binding. all genes where in case of expression slr ≠  <dig> and in case of hsf <dig> binding ab1 > ab <dig> were included into analysis; results are presented in additional file 14: table s <dig>  <cit> . the correlation was found between expression and actual hsf <dig> binding at elevated temperatures but not at physiological temperature. it is noteworthy that a negative statistical correlation was observed for both up- and down-regulated genes in spermatocytes, i.e. enhanced hsf <dig> binding was associated with a decreased expression. in contrast, a positive statistical correlation was observed for up-regulated genes in hepatocytes, i.e. enhanced hsf <dig> binding was associated with an increased expression.

for hsf <dig> binding values ab1-ab0 ≥  <dig> and fdr <  <dig>  were taken into consideration; in case of changes in expression level – range of slrs presented in table  <dig>

finally, we searched for hsf1-regulated genes putatively involved in cell type- specific response to stress conditions. among genes that bind hsf <dig> and are activated in spermatocytes treated at 38°c but not in heat shocked hepatocytes the most interesting seems to be spen ), which is a transcriptional repressor. among genes that bind hsf <dig> and are negatively regulated in spermatocytes the biggest group are those involved in dna replication and cell division, regulation of transcription and rna processing, protein folding and degradation, and intracellular transport . interestingly, several genes that are bound by hsf <dig> and are negatively regulated in spermatocytes treated with hyperthermia at 38°c are essential for spermatogenesis . it has been shown that their knock-out leads to defects in spermatogenesis. the most interesting in this group are genes involved in the repression of transposable elements: tdrd <dig>  piwil <dig> and mov10l <dig>  we verified expression of some of these genes using quantitative rt-pcr analysis on independent material and confirmed significant down-regulation of tdrd <dig> and mov10l <dig> .

discussion
the changes in the global gene expression profiles following heat shock were already studied in different organisms , and in different types of cells or tissues  <cit> , even in mouse liver  <cit>  and testes  <cit> . although some differences in heat shock response between somatic cells exist, in all of them pro-survival signaling pathways are activated. their activation was also observed in mouse testes when changes in whole tissue were analyzed  <cit> . the strategy used in the present study allowed us to find differences in the heat shock response between somatic and spermatogenic germ cells. by isolating the spermatogenic cells we avoided the overlapping of signals from different types of cells. we found that genes selected by li et al.  <cit>  as activated in whole testes during heat shock at 43°c  are not induced in spermatogenic cells, although they are strongly induced in hepatocytes. in fact, the lack of strong activation of hsp genes in isolated spermatogenic cells documented in the present study is consistent with some previous findings  <cit> . hence, our data confirms basic differences between spermatogenic cells and somatic cells  in the transcriptional response to stress.

spermatogenic cells do not activate “universal” pro-survival pathways in response to stress. however, because a large fraction of genes affected in spermatocytes during hyperthermia remains uncharacterized, identification of the signaling pathways involved in stress response is difficult. additionally, considerably more genes are repressed than activated, and primarily pathways connected with rna processing are strongly repressed under stress conditions. posttranscriptional regulation is of critical importance during mammalian spermatogenesis. the testis has the greatest enrichment of tissue-specific splicing  <cit> . also alternative promoters and polya sites, antisense transcripts, necessity of the mrna storage for a longer time before translation, and a different class of regulatory rnas contribute to transcriptome diversification in testis  <cit> . thus, deregulated rna processing during heat shock could result in serious disturbances of spermatogenesis.

hsf <dig> binding to dna was studied on a genome-wide scale in saccharomyces and drosophila cells or embryos  <cit> , as well as in mammalian cells  <cit> , including mouse testis at a physiological temperature  <cit> . all these studies suggest that hsf <dig> may regulate diverse cellular processes that extend far beyond protein folding, the general role of hsps that are the major targets of this factor. here we found that several genes involved in processes other than protein folding  were bound by hsf <dig>  and that many genes were similarly bound by hsf <dig> in both hepatocytes and spermatocytes despite a completely different nature in the resulting transcriptional response. recently, it has also been noted that hsf <dig> has important cell-specific functions at a normal physiological temperature. it regulates cancer-specific genes that support oncogenic processes in highly tumorigenic cells, in which it is more active than in less malignant cells  <cit> . in testis under physiologically normal conditions, hsf <dig> is required for transcriptional regulation of sex chromosomal multicopy genes  <cit> . here we have observed that only a few genes were strongly bound by hsf <dig> in purified spermatocytes not subjected to hyperthermia.

although hsf <dig> binding in hepatocytes and spermatocytes shows a relatively similar pattern, transcription of hsf1-bound genes is regulated in an apparently different way in these cells. additionally, in spermatocytes heat shocked at 38°c and 43°c the changes in transcription are markedly different despite a rather similar pattern of hsf <dig> binding. even though hsf <dig> binds more effectively to dna in cells treated at 43°c, changes in the transcription level of hsf1-bound genes are much stronger in spermatocytes treated at 38°c. we have concluded that regulation of transcription by hsf <dig> binding is not only a cell type-specific mechanism, but it is also affected by temperature. hsf <dig> binding to the dna in most cases does not correlate with significant changes in gene expression . it is not surprising because the dna-binding ability and the transactivation competence of hsf <dig> are regulated independently. hsf <dig> activity is modulated not only by interactions with chaperones but also by numerous posttranslational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation, and sumoylation  <cit> . additionally, independently of its transactivating activities, hsf <dig> can control the chromatin organization in response to heat shock  <cit> . hsf <dig> mediates a genome-wide and massive histone deacetylation interacting with hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  moreover, the transcriptional response to stress may be regulated by micrornas. recently, wilmink et al.  <cit>  identified a group of mirnas  differentially expressed following hyperthermia in dermal fibroblasts. one should not exclude the cell-type specificity of mirna-related mechanisms in the regulation of heat shock response, which introduces an additional level of complexity in its regulation. in line with this possibility, expression of an extra class of small rnas molecules involved in gene silencing, so called pirna, is expressed specifically in spermatogenic cells  <cit> .

the most unexpected finding of our study is that binding of hsf <dig> could result in inhibition of the transcription on a wide scale. hsf <dig> is well known as a transcriptional activator, and only a few reports have shown that hsf <dig> can act as a transcriptional repressor of specific genes involved in the acute phase response and inflammation  and blocks the activation of the genes mentioned above, after stimulation . recently, it was suggested that hsf <dig> can inhibit transcription on a wider scale by interactions with alu elements containing hsf binding sites  <cit> . such sequences are frequently present in the corresponding genomic regions of the down-regulated transcripts in antisense orientation. therefore, the antisense-mediated mechanism of inhibition of the transcription following heat shock was proposed. this study additionally implies that the direction of regulation  is influenced by the location of the hsf1-binding site, what was also suggested by mendillo et al.  <cit> . they stated that genes positively regulated by hsf <dig> were more likely bound at the promoter, whereas negatively regulated were more frequently bound in distal regions. promoter tiling microarrays used in our study limited analyzes to promoter regions. hence, it cannot be excluded that analyzing hsf <dig> binding by chip-seq could enable the identification of even more genes repressed following hsf <dig> binding. furthermore, other transcription factors  could interfere with changes in gene expression following hyperthermia, in either hsf1-dependent or independent mechanisms.

among hsf1-bound genes negatively regulated in spermatocytes in response to hyperthermia, the biggest group is involved in dna replication and cell division. they encode for proteins required for centrosome duplication, meiotic recombination and spindle organization, among others. thus, disturbances of their expression can directly influence the progression of meiosis. other hsf1-bound genes specifically down-regulated in spermatocytes are involved in rna processing  and transcriptional regulation, which also may have a huge impact on spermatogenesis. hsf1-dependent pathways of protein folding and degradation were also differentially expressed in spermatocytes and hepatocytes. the greatest difference was noted in the case of dnaja <dig> expression. dnaja <dig> is generally a widely expressed co-chaperone that together with multiple hsp <dig> proteins takes part in protein folding  <cit> . in dnaja <dig> null mice, defects in fertility were observed. however, the defects resulted from a lack of dnaja <dig> in sertoli cells rather than in spermatogenic cells. although a lack of dnaja <dig> in sertoli cells leads to aberrant androgen signaling, disruption of sertoli–germ cell contact and severe defects in spermiogenesis  <cit> , it is not known what is a consequence of its lack in spermatogenic cells.

functionally essential for spermatogenesis and male fertility are some other hsf1-bound genes negatively regulated in spermatocytes following heat shock . arrest of spermiogenesis and increased apoptosis was observed in testes from celf <dig> knock-out males  <cit> . celf <dig> regulates the alternative splicing, which is of a greater importance to spermatogenic cells than to other cells. however it is broadly expressed and belongs to a bigger family of rna binding proteins, that could possibly perform overlapping functions. thus, is seems that heat shock-induced down-regulation of celf <dig>  could be important, but not critical for induction of apoptosis in spermatocytes.

disruption of spermatogenesis before the end of meiotic division was observed in spo <dig>  piwil <dig>  tdrd <dig> and mov10l <dig> knockout mice. all these genes, which we report to be repressed in hsf1-dependent manner, are expressed at a high level and almost exclusively in testes . spo <dig> is a type ii like topoisomerase that generates double-strand breaks during meiosis. consequently, mouse null spo <dig> spermatocytes fail to synapse chromosomes and progress beyond the zygotene stage of meiosis  <cit> . piwil <dig>  tdrd <dig> and mov10l <dig> are all involved in mobile elements silencing, which is carried out in the primordial mouse testis. lack of these proteins results in de-repression of retrotransposons   <cit> . piwil <dig>  belongs to the piwi  proteins family which also contains piwil <dig>  and piwil <dig> . following heat shock in spermatocytes we observed down regulation of piwil <dig> and piwil <dig>  while piwil <dig> expression was absent . although mutations for any of the three murine piwi proteins confer male-specific sterility  <cit> , the exact function of piwil <dig> and piwil <dig> proteins in adult testis is not known. they are a subset of the argonaute proteins and associate specifically with small rnas called piwi-interacting rnas   <cit> . in the absence of piwil <dig> and piwil <dig> proteins, spermatocytes and spermatids are devoid of all pirnas and spermatogenesis is terminally arrested during prophase i of meiosis  <cit> .

piwi proteins and pirnas are enriched in the male germ-cell specific structures: the dense  body and the chromatoid body. the dense body is associated with synapsis and the formation of the xy body during meiosis, however both processes are not affected in the absence of piwi proteins  <cit> . the x and y chromosomes in the dense body are transcriptionally silenced during meiosis at the pachytene stage  <cit> , yet the sex chromosomal multicopy genes can escape the postmeiotic repression  <cit> . because piwil <dig> probably participates in chromatin relaxation during dna repair  <cit> , one could speculate that it might also relax chromatin in sex chromosomes to enable transcription of such genes. it has been shown that expression of multicopy genes located in the dense body is regulated by hsf <dig> and hsf <dig>  <cit> . because either activation of hsf <dig> or simultaneous lack of both hsf <dig> and hsf <dig> are connected with the diminished fertility of males  <cit> , one could speculate that disturbances in the transcription of the sex chromosomal multicopy genes could be at least one reason for hsf1-related fertility problems in males. the chromatoid body contains abundant rna binding proteins and has been implicated in the storage, metabolism, and cytoplasm-to-nuclear transport of mrna, small rna, and related proteins  <cit> . multiple members of the tudor domain containing proteins are also components of the chromatoid body and can associate with piwi proteins. tdrd <dig> specifically interacts with piwil <dig>  <cit> . in addition, piwil <dig> positively regulates tdrd <dig> expression at the mrna level  <cit> . it has been proposed that tdrd <dig> can act as a scaffold protein for complex assembly in the pirna pathway  <cit> . mov10l <dig>  also associates with the piwil2-pirna complex in adult testis  <cit> . genetic disruption of the mov10l <dig> rna helicase domain in mice is connected with a lack of pirnas and male sterility. thus, down-regulation of piwil <dig>  tdrd <dig> and mov10l <dig> following heat shock is apparently connected with deregulated pirna biogenesis.

our study revealed that transcription of many genes important for spermatogenesis is negatively regulated following hyperthermia independently of hsf <dig> binding. it has been shown that lack of cdk <dig>  <cit> , mlh <dig>  <cit> , sycp <dig>  <cit> , mybl <dig>  <cit> , gja <dig>  <cit> , cldn <dig>  <cit> , bsg  <cit> , pou5f <dig>  <cit> , nras  <cit> , ctsl  <cit> , and possibly many others is connected with male sterility. we propose that repression of these genes  in cells subjected to hyperthermia results from activity of spen, which is specifically induced in heat shocked spermatocytes. spen is a large multidomain protein with ability to bind to dna and rna, and is a putative general transcriptional repressor . importantly, spen can interact directly with smrt  and members of the nurd  complex including hdac <dig> and hdac <dig>  mta <dig>  mbd <dig> and rbap <dig>  <cit> . it was suggested that spen serves as a nuclear matrix platform that organizes and integrates transcriptional responses: recruits proteins involved in histone deacetylation, or acts by sequestration of transcriptional activators. here we show that heat shock-induced up-regulation of spen expression correlates with hsf <dig> binding to its promoter, which indicates its direct hsf <dig> dependence.

CONCLUSIONS
although in somatic and spermatogenic cells after activation hsf <dig> binds to many promoters in a similar way, its impact on genes’ expression is completely different. this results in a completely different heat shock response in these two types of cells. in hepatocytes, which are able to survive following heat shock, hsf <dig> activation is connected rather with up-regulated gene expression, whereas in spermatogenic cells, which induce apoptosis, hsf <dig> activation is connected with repression of the transcription. hsf1-dependent induction of apoptosis in spermatocytes seems to be caused by the simultaneous repression of many genes essential for spermatogenesis. some of these genes could be down-regulated due to direct hsf <dig> binding, while repression of other genes is putatively an indirect effect of hsf <dig>  executed by transcription repressors regulated by this factor. hence, a broad range of other transcription factors, some of them induced by hsf <dig>  could also contribute to cell-type specific mechanisms regulating transcriptional response to hyperthermia. the obtained results suggest that deregulated rna  metabolism could be the most important factor triggering spermatogenic cell death following heat shock.
