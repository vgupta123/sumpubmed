BACKGROUND
geobacter spp. are common members of anoxic freshwater sediment and subsurface microbial communities, where they are involved in the reduction of oxidized metal species and the turnover of organic matter  <cit> . members of this genus show promise for bioremediation of anoxic subsurface environments contaminated with toxic radionuclides  <cit> . while dissimilatory metal reduction is a hallmark feature of geobacter, the ability to use chlorinated organic compounds as electron acceptors has only recently been discovered in this genus, and appears to be restricted to a single geobacter clade  with only a few cultured representatives  <cit> . organohalide respiration has been described for geobacter thiogenes strain k and geobacter lovleyi strain sz, which dechlorinate trichloroacetate to dichloroacetate and tetrachloroethene  to cis- <dig> -dichloroethene , respectively  <cit> . in addition, another pce-to-cis-dce-dechlorinating g. lovleyi strain, designated strain kb- <dig>  was identified in the pce-to-ethene-dechlorinating consortium kb- <dig>  <cit> . g. lovleyi 16s rrna gene sequences have been detected at the contaminated oak ridge ifrc site  <cit>  and in trichloroethene -contaminated sediments from ft. lewis, wa  <cit> . a recent continuous flow column study using the pce-to-ethene-dechlorinating bioaugmentation consortium bio-dechlor inoculum  containing g. lovleyi strain sz indicated that pce-dechlorinating geobacter strains enhance dissolution of free phase pce  <cit> . further, g. lovleyi strain sz uses graphite electrodes as a direct electron donor for reductive dechlorination , possibly enabling innovative bioremediation approaches  <cit> . the organohalide-respiring geobacter strains share 16s rrna gene sequences with 98–100% identity to each other but only 93% identity with g. sulfurreducens strain pca, the type strain for the geobacter genus. among the δ-proteobacteriadesulfuromonas michiganensis is the only other pce-to-cis-dce-respiring species but genome information is not available  <cit> . the genus anaeromyxobacter  comprises isolates with sequenced genomes, which are capable of using chlorinated phenols as respiratory electron acceptors, but pce dechlorination has not been reported  <cit> .

due to its implications for bioremediation of sites contaminated with both chlorinated ethenes and radionuclides  <cit> , and the paucity of genome information of pce-respiring δ-proteobacteriag. lovleyi strain sz is a promising reference strain for understanding the physiological and evolutionary responses of microbes to anthropogenic changes in the environment. here we present the g. lovleyi strain sz genome sequence, including the discovery of a unique  <dig> kbp plasmid . the plasmid is notable, as it contains laterally acquired genes and some that encode functions important to geobacter metabolism such as cobalamin biosynthesis. comparative analyses of the strain sz genome revealed significant functional divergence from previously sequenced geobacter spp. and mobile elements sharing genomic features of pelobacter, a distinct genus of the δ-proteobacteria.

methods
cultures and growth conditions
g. lovleyi strain sz  <cit> , g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig>   <cit> , g. thiogenes <cit> , and four g. lovleyi isolates geo <dig> , geo <dig> , geo <dig> , and geo <dig>  obtained from pce-to-cis-dce-dechlorinating microcosms established with fort lewis, wa, soil  <cit>  were utilized in this study. g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig> was isolated from consortium kb- <dig>  following a series of eight 1: <dig> vol/vol dilution transfers to defined mineral medium supplemented with 90 mg l− <dig> pce and 10 mm acetate, the final dilution culture was used to inoculate a set of serial dilution agarose shake tubes amended with 10 mm fumarate and 10 mm acetate  <cit> . transfer of a colony from a 10− <dig> dilution tube to liquid culture yielded a pure culture of g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig>  in addition, the pce-to-ethene-dechlorinating consortia bdi and kb- <dig>  <cit>  were grown and maintained with  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> pce as electron acceptor. pure and mixed cultures were grown in 60 ml serum bottles containing 40 ml reduced, defined mineral salts medium with 5 mm acetate serving as both carbon source and electron donor with an n2-co <dig>  headspace  <cit> . lactate  substituted for acetate to grow g. thiogenes and consortium bdi. the kb- <dig> consortium was maintained with methanol as an electron donor, amended to  <dig> times the electron equivalents required for complete dechlorination. to test the effects of cyanocobalamin  on pce dechlorination, cultures of strain sz were amended with  <dig>  mg ml− <dig> pce as the sole electron acceptor and  <dig>   <dig>  and 750 μg cn-cbl l− <dig>  chlorinated ethenes were quantified by gas chromatography as described  <cit> .

plasmid stability
to explore if plasmid psz <dig> was stably maintained , strain sz cultures were grown at 35°c with 20 mm sodium fumarate as the electron acceptor in medium with  <dig>  μg l− <dig> and without cn-cbl. when visible turbidity was apparent after  <dig> to  <dig> hours, the cultures were consecutively transferred  for at least  <dig> times to fresh medium. plasmid curing was also attempted by amending liquid cultures with  <dig> – <dig> % sds   <cit>  or  <dig>  m l-ascorbic acid  <cit> .

genomic dna extraction and pcr
pcr primers were designed using primer <dig> software  based on the predicted open reading frame  encoding the homolog to the replication initiation protein repa identified on psz <dig>  the primers repa_136f , and repa_700r  were used to amplify a 565 bp fragment of the psz <dig> repa gene. to test for the presence of repa in other cultures, biomass was collected from 2 ml aliquots of pure and mixed cultures by centrifugation at  <dig>  rpm for 20 min at room temperature . the pellet was added to a bead tube and the dna extracted according to the protocol for the powersoil dna isolation kit  provided by the manufacturer. pcr reactions were prepared in a volume of  <dig> μl containing 1x pcr buffer,  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  200 μm dntps,  <dig> nm of each forward and reverse primers,  <dig>  u of gotaq dna polymerase and  <dig> μl of dna template. the pcr thermocycler program for the repa-targeted primers was 94°c for 2 min, followed by  <dig> cycles of denaturation at 94°c for 30 s, annealing at 56°c for 30s, extension at 72°c for 30s, and a final extension at 72°c for 6 min. pcr was also carried out using the primer pair geo564f/840r  <cit>  that targets the 16s rrna gene of all geobacteraceae. pcr conditions and the amplification profile used for the geo564f/840r set were as described for the repa primer set.

plasmid isolation
for large plasmid isolation using a modified protocol based on the kieser method  <cit> ,  <dig> to 200 ml of fumarate-grown sz culture and 100 ml each of fumarate-grown g. thiogenes and the four fort lewis geobacter isolates were collected by centrifugation . the dna was isolated as previously described except that the plasmid dna was precipitated by standard methods  <cit>  and suspended in a final volume of 50–100 μl te buffer . plasmid dna extracts were separated by electrophoresis through a  <dig> %  agarose tris-acetate gel run in 1x tris-acetate edta  buffer  <cit> . dna was visualized by staining in  <dig>  μg ethidium bromide per ml tae buffer solution. isolate g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig> was grown with 10 mm acetate and 90 mg l− <dig> pce, and plasmid dna was extracted from biomass obtained from 1 l of culture suspension using the qiagen plasmid midi kit and the modified protocol for large inserts .

sequencing
genomic dna of g. lovleyi strain sz was extracted from cells grown with acetate and fumarate following established protocols . sequencing was performed by the department of energy’s joint genome institute  using a combination of  <dig> and sanger reads with average lengths of  <dig> and 949 bp, respectively. the total  <dig>  reads provided an average 25-fold coverage for the chromosome and 40-fold coverage for the plasmid. the g. lovleyi strain sz genome sequences have been assigned genbank accession numbers cp <dig> and cp <dig> for the chromosome and psz <dig>  respectively. dna was extracted from consortium kb- <dig> following an established protocol  <cit> , and clone libraries were generated by the jgi using in-house protocols  and sequenced by the sanger approach. the strain kb- <dig> plasmid dna was incorporated into a bar-coded  <dig> gs flx titanium sequencing run at the center for applied genomics at the university of toronto. the  <dig> reads, along with the consortium kb- <dig> metagenome contigs identified as geobacter plasmid sequences, were aligned against psz <dig> using the geneious assembly tool . metagenome reads with disagreements with the psz <dig> sequence were verified and removed if necessary. read depth was at least 3-fold for most of the assembly with a maximum of 12-fold coverage, but as low as single coverage in two regions of less than 136 bp. amplicons of the 16s rrna genes of the ft. lewis g. lovleyi strains geo <dig> , geo <dig> , geo <dig> , and geo <dig>  were sequenced twice each by the sanger approach and assigned the genbank accession numbers jn <dig> through jn <dig> 

computational analyses
customized perl scripts were used to determine gc percentage of all predicted protein-coding genes on the strain sz chromosome and psz <dig> with standard deviations from genomic averages computed in r . cogs assignments were determined from the ncbi .ptt files for the geobacteraceae and related non-geobacteraceae chromosomes  and plasmids  using customized perl scripts. candidate c-type cytochromes were determined by searching all strain sz amino acid sequences for the cxxch motif using a customized perl script, and then further screened for homology to c-type cytochromes in the refseq database using psi-blast   <cit>  and the prosite profile for c-type cytochromes . cxxch-containing sequences lacking over 50% of psi-blast matches annotated as c-type cytochromes or lacking recognizable c-type cytochrome prosite profiles  were eliminated from further analysis. trans-membrane regions of predicted outer membrane receptor proteins were determined using pred-tmbb  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of psz <dig> and the chromosomal genomic islands on the sz chromosome were analyzed for repeats using reputer  <cit> . codon adaptation indices  for strain sz orfs encoded on the plasmid and chromosomal genomic islands were computed against a codon usage table based upon all strain sz chromosomal orfs using the e-cai server  <cit> . computed cai were normalized to the expected cai based upon a 5% level of significance for the bootstrapped set of all orfs on the sz chromosome, such that putative foreign genes  would score <  <dig>   <cit> . the origin of replication of psz <dig> was identified using ori-finder  <cit> , which searches for dnaa-binding sites at regions of gc-skew reversals. the amino acid sequences of replication initiation genes  were used to infer plasmid phylogeny and 16s rrna genes dna sequences were used to infer genome phylogeny. all alignments were performed in muscle  <cit>  and used to build trees in phylip with topology inferred by bootstrapped neighbor-joining and branch lengths computed by maximum likelihood  <cit> . 16s rrna gene sequences were also used to confirm family and genus affiliation using the ribosomal database project  <cit> . trees were visualized and formatted using the interactive tree of life tool  <cit> .

translations of all predicted genbank orfs on psz <dig> were run through blastp  <cit>  against the nr database with blosum <dig> and an e-value cutoff of  <dig> . to determine psz <dig> genes and chromosomal genomic islands acquired from bacteria outside of the geobacteraceae, all translated orfs on psz <dig> and the sz chromosome were queried using blastp against the genomes of geobacter sulfurreducens strain pca , geobacter metallireducens strain gs- <dig> , geobacter uraniireducens strain rf <dig> , geobacter sp. strain frc- <dig> , geobacter bemidjiensis strain bem , geobacter sp. strain m <dig> , geobacter sp. strain m <dig> , pelobacter propionicus dsm  <dig> , and p. carbinolicus dsm  <dig> . pairwise average amino acid identities between predicted proteomes were mined from blastp output using custom perl scripts and genome affiliations of top blastp matches were checked against img statistics for g. lovleyi strain sz . sequence similarities to orthologs for psz <dig> cobalamin biosynthesis genes, psz <dig> repa, the chromosomal pce-genes, and chromosomal conjugative pilus tra-genes were determined using psi-blast  <cit> . further functional inference of amino acid sequences from plasmid-or genomic-island-encoded genes were performed by parsing for conserved domains in pfam  and conserved motifs in prosite . a physical map of psz <dig> was plotted using cgview  <cit> .

RESULTS
the geobacter lovleyi strain sz genome
sequencing of the g. lovleyi strain sz genome revealed both typical geobacteraceae characteristics  and elements not previously found among members of the geobacter genus, including genes encoding putative reductive dehalogenases  and a 77-kbp plasmid designated psz <dig>  the  <dig> % gc content,  <dig>  predicted open reading frames , and  <dig>  mb size of the strain sz chromosome  are comparable to other sequenced genomes of members of the geobacter genus, g. sulfurreducens pca  <cit> , g. metallireducens gs- <dig>  <cit> , g. bemidjiensis bem  <cit> , g. uraniireducens rf <dig>  <cit> , and geobacter spp. strains frc- <dig>  <cit> , m <dig>  and m <dig>  all ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb in size. the strain sz chromosome has  <dig> chromosomal genes assigned to the energy production clusters of orthologous groups  , a somewhat lower count compared to total cogs class c genes on the seven other sequenced geobacter genomes , indicating a shift in the strain sz respiration-related gene repertoire. by comparison, the  <dig> strain sz genes functionally classified in the signal transduction cogs  lies within the range for geobacter spp. . sz chromosomal genes have 40% of their top blastp matches in the genomes of other geobacter spp. , where average blastp identities between the strain sz and each geobacter proteome range from  <dig> to 56%. by comparison, psz <dig> has  <dig> % gc content and only eight  of its  <dig> total predicted orfs with top blastp matches  among geobacter spp. .

organohalide respiration
a defining feature distinguishing the g. lovleyi strain sz chromosome from other geobacter genomes is the presence of a gene cluster related to organohalide respiration. the ability of g. lovleyi strains to respire pce resides on a chromosomal genomic island  containing two putative pcea rdases. the pce-genes predicted to play a role in pce respiration, pcet-pcec-pcea1-pceb1-pcea2-pceb <dig>   comprise a region with a gc content of 37%, as much as  <dig>  standard deviations below the chromosomal average of  <dig> %. the codon adaptation index , a comparative measure of codon usage, for the six pce-genes cluster fall below the average for sz chromosomal orfs  indicating recent acquisition by the sz genome. the ‘pce’ chromosomal region, in which the pce-genes reside, exhibits an apparent reversal in gc-skew . finally, the six pce-genes have no homologs in any other geobacter or related pelobacter genomes. together, these features indicate that the sz chromosomal pce region encoding the pce-genes in an atypical region acquired by lateral gene transfer.

the six pce-genes of the g. lovleyi genome are homologous to genes in functionally characterized pce respiration gene clusters. functions for three of the four components of the pce-gene cluster, pcea-pceb-pcec-pcet, from the firmicutes  is supported by experimental evidence in desulfitobacterium hafniense strains tce <dig>  <cit>  and y <dig>  <cit>  and dehalobacter restrictus strain per-k <dig>  <cit> . pcea encodes the catalytic pcea rdase subunit, whose activity towards organohalides is dependent upon a bound cobalamin cofactor  <cit> . pceb is inferred to encode a membrane-bound subunit to pcea, but direct experimental evidence for this function is lacking. pcec is co-transcribed with pcea-pceb in d. hafniense y <dig> and the pcec protein is believed to function in regulating pcea gene expression and electron transfer to the pcea protein  <cit> . pcet encodes a protein shown to function as a chaperone to the pcea preprotein  <cit> . the order of the predicted g. lovleyi pce-genes, pcet-pcec-pcea1-pceb1-pcea2-pceb <dig>  differs from that of the functionally-characterized pce-gene clusters . the g. lovleyi pcea-pceb orfs, encoding the predicted pce rdase catalytic subunit and the membrane anchor subunit, respectively, are duplicated on tandem  <dig>  bp long blocks sharing  <dig> % nucleotide identity . despite apparent differences in organization, the amino acid sequences encoded by all six g. lovleyi pce-genes have their most similar homologs among the functionally characterized pce-gene clusters from desulfitobacterium hafniense strain y <dig> , d. hafninese strain tce <dig> , and d. restrictus . both sets of strain sz’s putative pcea and pceb proteins share 33–36% amino acid  identity with pcea  and pceb  from d. hafniense y <dig>  <cit> . the g. lovleyi pceas share only distant similarity with the genomic-island-encoded vcra rdase of dehalococcoides sp. strain vs   <cit> . glov_ <dig>  shares a fmn-binding domain , a polyferredoxin  domain, and 33% aa identity with the d. hafniense y <dig> pcec regulatory protein . glov_ <dig>  is annotated as 'peptidylprolyl isomerase' and shares 19% aa identity with pcet from d. hafniense . despite their apparent shared conserved functions, the low sequence similarities and lack of synteny between strain sz and the desulfitobacterium spp. pce-gene clusters suggests the gene clusters have diverged from their shared ancestral gene cluster over time.

an is21-like integrase gene cluster and a transposase gene flank the strain sz pce-genes upstream and downstream, respectively, but neither exhibits the compositional features suggestive of recent lateral gene transfer, with gc content, codon biases, and gc-skew consistent with the g. lovleyi genome. transposase-associated repeats were found to mediate circularization, and presumably excision, of the d. hafniense strain tce <dig> pcea-encoding transposon  <cit> . in contrast, no repeats flanking the sz pcea genomic island could be detected, and the isl3-superfamily transposase  downstream of the sz pce-genes lacks detectable similarity with the mutator family transposases  found on the d. hafniense strain tce <dig> transposable element. furthermore, the rve family integrase  and is21-type atpase/integrase cluster upstream of the sz pce-genes, along with adjacent non-coding dna , do not share homology with the dsib integrase in the vcra genomic islands of dehalococcoides <cit>  nor any other mobilization-related genomic elements  associated with rdase genes  <cit> . the integrase and the atpase instead appear to originate from within the geobacter genus, sharing 62% and 80% aa identity, respectively, with their homologs in g. uraniireducens. the sz pce genomic island integrase and transposase lack homology with known rdase-associated mobile elements, while the gc content of the pce-genes suggests much of this element was acquired by strain sz relatively recently. the apparent divergence of the strain sz pce-genes from their closest known orthologs in desulfitobacterium spp. suggests the sz genes are not a recent lateral transfer from the desulfitobacterium/dehalobacter group but from another, yet unidentified donor.

f-factor conjugation
a second predicted chromosomal genomic island harbors a predicted f-factor conjugative pilus tra-gene cluster , trae-l-e-k-b-v-c-n-n-w, trau-trbc, traf, trag, , which lacks homologs in any sequenced geobacter genome. the cluster of tra-genes form part of a region  spanning  <dig> orfs, flanked by a transposase  and a resolvase  gene. aside from the  <dig> tra-genes,  <dig> of the tr region genes are assigned to cogs class l or class v, which include endo/exoribonucleases and helicases, while another  <dig> genes have hypothetical or unknown functions. a total of  <dig> genes in the tr region, including a majority of the tra-genes, share > 75% aa identity with orthologs on the chromosome of pelobacter propionicus dsm  <dig>  given that the average sz chromosome-encoded protein shares 57% identity with blastp matches in p. propionicus, the tr region composition suggests lateral acquisition of this region, possibly from a pelobacteraceae-like donor. the region is designated as a genomic island based on its similarity to a non-geobacteraceae genome and the predominance of hypothetical genes and dna-manipulating genes  <cit> . an alternate hypothesis for the origin of the tr region is a shared ancestry within the order desulfuromonadales, which includes the pelobacteraceae and the geobacteraceae, with subsequent loss of this element in the geobacter. with only seven sequenced geobacter genomes available, vertical inheritance cannot be ruled out; however, the high similarity to homologs in pelobacter does suggest that the tra-gene cluster is part of a genomic island.

the tra-gene cluster, glov_ <dig> to glov_ <dig>  encodes proteins homologous to known plasmid-encoded dna-transfer f-type conjugative pili  <cit> . out of the  <dig> proteins encoded on the tra-gene cluster, five have psi-blast matches to genes unique to f-type conjugative pili , while seven have psi-blast matches to conserved f-type and p-type conjugative pilus “core” genes: traetraltraktrabtravtrac, and trag <cit>  . all but one of the proteins on the strain sz putative f-type pilus cluster share synteny and high similarity with genes on the chromosome of p. propionicus  and the  <dig> kbp plasmid ppro <dig> of p. propionicus  . nearly half of the  <dig> genes in the strain sz conjugative pilus cluster have gc contents near the strain sz genomic average and normalized cai >  <dig>  , suggesting a sufficient residence time on the sz genome to ameliorate to sz chromosomal codon usage  <cit> . four additional genomic islands on the sz chromosome are predicted based on low %gc, disruption of gc-skew, and/or the lack of homologs in a majority of other geobacter spp. genomes. these additional inferred genomic islands, hyp <dig>  hyp <dig>  and hyp <dig> encode hypothetical proteins and proteins assigned to cogs class l or class v, while genomic island m contains five genes predicted to function in capsule polysaccharide biosynthesis .

electron transfer and oxidoreductases
additional features distinguishing the g. lovleyi strain sz genome from other geobacteraceae include the reduced number of genes encoding c-type cytochromes and the lack of several key genes related to oxygen tolerance and reactive oxygen species  detoxification. the g. lovleyi strain sz genome encodes  <dig> orfs encoding c-type cytochromes , of which only six are predicted multi-heme cytochromes with  <dig> or more cxxch heme-binding motifs, and none have more than  <dig> cxxch motifs . in contrast, described geobacter genomes encode 76– <dig> c-type cytochromes, of which 17– <dig> have  <dig> or more cxxch motifs, with a maximum of  <dig> heme-binding motifs  <cit> . p. propionicus has  <dig> orfs predicted to encode c-type cytochromes, with only one having more than  <dig> heme-binding motifs .

* according to butler et al.  <cit> .

for each genome, number of c-type cytochromes with more than  <dig> predicted heme-binding sites is positively correlated with total predicted c-type cytochromes .

the reduced set of multi-heme c-type cytochromes in strain sz  appears adequate in mediating respiration with u, mn, and fe oxides  <cit>  and electrode surfaces  <cit> . specific functions have only been determined for cytochromes with  <dig> or fewer hemes  <cit> . decaheme c-type cytochromes have been confirmed to mediate respiration on electrodes in shewanella <cit>  and an 8-heme outer-membrane cytochrome has been shown to be involved in electron transfer to solid state electrodes in geobacter sulfurreducens <cit> . smaller outer membrane c-type cytochromes with 4– <dig> hemes are essential for geobacter respiration with insoluble fe and mn oxides  <cit> . pila-type pilins may play an essential role in metal reduction  <cit> , particularly in radionuclide reduction  <cit> . strain sz encodes a putative pila  sharing 81% aa identity with the conductive pilus protein  of g. sulfurreducens   <cit> . p. propionicus also encodes a putative pila , which shares 80% identity with the g. sulfurreducens pila. yet, p. propionicus has a reduced repertoire of c-type cytochromes, and is completely lacking decaheme c-type cytochromes . accordingly, p. propionicus lacks the ability to respire on electrodes or radionuclides  <cit> . by contrast, the strain sz genome carries the predicted minimal set of genes to allow utilization of a comparable range of electron acceptors as other geobacter spp.  <cit> .

additional genes that are key to geobacter electron transfer are present as multiple paralogs on the strain sz genome. the strain sz genome encodes  <dig> molybdopterin oxidoreductase domain proteins , a larger number compared to other geobacter genomes. the strain sz molybdopterin oxidoreductase-type proteins, for which function can be inferred, include three nitrate reductases and two formate dehydrogenases . one of the nitrate reductase proteins is a periplasmic-type, sharing 43% aa identity  with the respiratory nitrate reductase  from desulfovibrio desulfuricans <cit> . the role of the two predicted formate dehydrogenases is unclear, as strain sz does not utilize formate as an electron source or carbon source under pce- or fe-reducing conditions  <cit> . the sz chromosome encodes seven fumarate reductase/succinate dehydrogenase-type flavoproteins , while no other geobacter genome encodes more than three. strain sz uses fumarate as an electron acceptor and has the full set of genes encoding tca cycle enzymes, but it is not clear which of these fumarate reductases play a role in these pathways. strain sz has five gene clusters  encoding pyruvate ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductase  complexes  of the type inferred to mediate incorporation of acetate into the tca cycle in g. sulfurreducens <cit> . strain sz lacks any homologs to subunit a of the pyruvate dehydrogenase e <dig> complex, making it unclear how the organism is able to use pyruvate as an electron donor  <cit> .

with regard to ros and oxygen detoxification, strain sz lacks homologs to the heme-copper  cytochrome c oxidases involved in the utilization of oxygen in g. sulfurreducens <cit> . accordingly, strain sz does not respire oxygen  <cit>  and responds negatively to in situ oxygen exposure  <cit> . strain sz possesses a complete gene cluster encoding homologs to the cytochrome bd ubiquinol oxidase complex shown to mediate oxygen tolerance in anaerobes   <cit> , but lacks any homolog to the diheme cytochrome c peroxidase  or superoxide dismutase  shown to be strongly expressed in the presence of oxygen in g. uraniireducens <cit> . p. propionicus similarly lacks heme-copper  cytochrome c oxidase, maug, and soda. the absence of multi-heme c-type cytochromes with more than  <dig> hemes in strain sz may reflect differences in habitat and metabolic strategy as compared to other geobacter spp. the high-molecular weight c-type cytochromes with  <dig> or more hemes in g. sulfurreducens were suggested to function as biological capacitors  <cit> , providing storage for reducing equivalents while the energy-stressed geobacter cell is seeking new sources of terminal electron acceptors. although this is an intriguing hypothesis, the synthesis of such high molecular weight c-type cytochromes under nutrient limitations burdens the cell’s energy budget, and the true benefit for survival has yet to be demonstrated. the poor oxygen tolerance exhibited by strain sz, confining it to persistently anoxic habitats, may be associated with the reduced count of high molecular weight, multi-heme c-type cytochromes prevalent in aerotolerant geobacter. strain sz may utilize a strategy for temporary electron storage that is not dependent on c-type cytochromes or is able to employ cytochromes with fewer hemes to the same effect seen in aerotolerant geobacter.

consistent with all other geobacteraceae genomes, strain sz possesses the full set of genes for the de novo biosynthesis of both heme and cobalamin . yet, unlike any other geobacter spp. or pelobacter spp. genome, a majority of cobalamin biosynthesis genes in the sz genome are localized to a plasmid.

plasmid psz77
the g. lovleyi genome sequence revealed the presence of a  <dig>  bp circular plasmid, designated psz <dig>  out of the  <dig> total predicted plasmid-encoded orfs,  <dig> were inferred to be involved in plasmid maintenance and stability along with cobalamin biosynthesis, membrane transport, or other functions likely to play critical roles to strain sz’s metabolism . to date, g. metallireducens gs- <dig> and p. propionicus are the only closely related genomes to g. lovleyi that contain plasmids. the strain gs- <dig> plasmid is  <dig> kbp, and encodes genes predicted to be involved strictly in plasmid maintenance  <cit> . p. propionicus has a multipart genome comprised of a  <dig>  mbp chromosome and two plasmids. the larger  <dig> kbp plasmid ppro <dig> has cogs class functions related to energy production, and encodes the two cytochrome c ammonia-forming nitrite reductases, nrfa and nrfh, and a c-type cytochrome of unspecified function. the smaller  <dig> kbp plasmid ppro <dig> encodes two additional c-type cytochromes . no c-type cytochromes are encoded on psz <dig>  but 18% of the psz <dig> genes have predicted cogs class functions in coenzyme metabolism, mostly cobalamin biosynthesis .

plasmid maintenance
several psz <dig> protein-coding genes have putative function in plasmid replication or segregational stability and are associated with a predicted origin of replication, orir . glov_ <dig> encodes a protein with the replication initiation protein  domain . psz <dig> repa may function in a complex with the sz-chromosome-encoded dnaa protein to initiate plasmid replication  <cit>  at predicted dnaa-binding sites  <cit>  within the predicted orir downstream of repa on psz <dig> . the psz <dig> repa appears to share phylogenetic affiliation with the repa of various plasmids from β- or γ-proteobacteria , including an incq-like mobilizable plasmid  <cit>  and an incp-1-like environmental plasmid  <cit> . yet, psz <dig> repa does not share more than 39% aa identity  with the repa encoded by either of these two characterized plasmids nor any other homologs in the public databases, including its two homologs from the plasmids of δ-proteobacteria . upstream of psz <dig> repa, glov_ <dig> encodes a para-type plasmid partitioning atpase  and may provide a mechanism for distribution of psz <dig> copies to daughter cells after division  <cit> . glov_3687-glov_ <dig> encode proteins homologous to hipb and hipa , a putative toxin-antidote system , which may further contribute to psz <dig> stability  <cit> . together, these observations suggest that the psz <dig> replicon belongs to a new plasmid incompatibility group with inferred mechanisms for both active partitioning and post-segregational stability.

plasmid gene clusters associated with cobalamin metabolism
the strain sz chromosome contains several genes encoding cobalamin-dependent enzymes including ribonucleotide reductase, methionine synthase, and methylmalonyl-coa mutase; genes that are found in all other geobacter genomes . in addition, the strain sz chromosome encodes two pce rdases that presumably require a cobalamin co-factor  <cit> . accordingly, strain sz has genes encoding all inferred functions necessary for de novo cobalamin biosynthesis plus a predicted outer membrane transport system, which may play a role in uptake of extracellular corrinoids. unlike other geobacter genomes, the majority of strain sz cobalamin biosynthesis genes are encoded on the plasmid rather than the chromosome, localized in two gene clusters and a single gene locus . the first cobalamin biosynthesis gene cluster comprises  <dig> consecutive or overlapping genes  together encoding enzymes mediating the first  <dig> steps of de novo cobalamin biosynthesis and a cobalt abc transporter. genes  <dig> through  <dig> in the first cluster, cbij-h-g-f-d-l-k-c-a-cysg, along with one of the cobalt transport genes, cbin, lack isofunctional homologs on the sz chromosome suggesting the plasmid is essential when extracellular sources of cobalamin are lacking. the second cobalamin biosynthesis gene cluster comprises cobt  on the reverse strand and cobd/cbip  on the leading strand, both showing evidence of duplication with genes on the sz chromosome. cobt shares 78% aa identity with a chromosome-encoded cobt homolog. similarly, the cobd/cbip fusion shares 77% identity with a homologous fusion protein encoded on the sz chromosome. the third locus is comprised of a single gene, coba , possibly involved in the adenosylation step of cobalamin biosynthesis. the psz <dig> coba shares 36% aa identity with coba encoded on the sz chromosomal coba locus. genes encoding four of the final five steps of cobalamin biosynthesis, cbib, and cobucobs, and cobc, are found exclusively on the sz chromosome .

nine genes highly similar to chromosomal orthologs are inferred in outer membrane transport and are situated between both cobalamin biosynthesis gene clusters on psz <dig> . proteins encoded by genes at the 5’ and 3’ ends of this cluster, glov_ <dig> and glov_ <dig>  were inferred by pred-tmbb  <cit>  to have up to  <dig> trans-membrane ß-strands characteristic of the tonb-dependent outer membrane receptors  <cit> . proteins encoded by glov_ <dig>  glov_ <dig>  and glov_ <dig> have sequence characteristics matching the exbb, exbd, and tonb proteins involved in outer membrane transport of iron siderophores or vitamin b <dig> <cit> . glov_ <dig> encodes a protein annotated as a cobalt chelatase   of the type involved in late cobalt insertion  cobalamin biosynthesis  <cit> . the confirmed cobn cobalt chelatase of pseudomonas denitrificans is associated with pcobs and pcobt subunits  <cit> . no genes predicted to encode homologs to these pcobs and pcobt accessory proteins were identified on the plasmid or chromosome of strain sz, suggesting the psz <dig> cobn has a distinct function from its homolog in p. denitrificans. the psz <dig> putative cobn shared high aa similarity  with a protein encoded by gura_ <dig> on the g. uraniireducens chromosome, which is flanked by tonb receptor-related genes. these observations, coupled with its proximity to cobalamin biosynthesis clusters, suggest that the psz77-encoded cobn is associated with cobalamin metabolism in strain sz, though its exact biochemical role is unknown. the cobn-exbbexbdtonb gene cluster matches chromosomal homologs in only two related genomes, g. uraniireducens and p. propionicus, and is predicted to function in the transport of iron siderophores, vitamin b <dig>  or corrinoid precursors  <cit> .

psz <dig> genes encoding cobalamin biosynthesis and cobalamin transport functions suggest that the plasmid might be essential for strain sz growth. to examine the propensity for psz <dig> loss from g. lovleyi strain sz, a series of protocols developed for curing non-essential plasmids from host organisms were assayed  <cit> . sds at concentrations above  <dig> % inhibited growth of strain sz, but growth was stable over  <dig> consecutive transfers with ≤ <dig> % sds. l-ascorbate at concentrations of up to 10 mm did not affect growth over at least nine consecutive transfers. strain sz grew with pce or fumarate as electron acceptor over at least  <dig> consecutive transfers in cyanocobalamin-free and cyanocobalamin-amended medium. in samples from all treatments that allowed growth, pcr with the repa-targeted primer pair yielded amplicons of the expected size suggesting that the plasmid carrying the repa dna fragment was maintained under the growth conditions tested. the observation that strain sz grew in medium with or without cyanocobalamin amendment indicated that the cobalamin biosynthesis genes on psz <dig> are functional and that psz <dig> is maintained under growth conditions that do not require cobalamin biosynthesis. our efforts to cure strain sz of psz <dig> were unsuccessful due either to psz <dig> genes being essential to sz metabolism or due to the effectiveness of plasmid maintenance/stability-related genes. for example, the psz <dig> cobn-associated tonb-type outer-membrane transport genes, which match chromosomal orthologs in g. uraniireducens and p. propionicus, may have been critical to strain sz metabolism in the vitamin b12-amended cultures. the psz <dig> tonbexbbexbd genes associated with cobn do not correspond to a complete cluster on the sz chromosome, suggesting that transport of cobalamin and/or other organometallic complexes made the plasmid essential under the cultivation conditions used. with these apparently essential functions, psz <dig> shares one of the defining traits of the significantly larger secondary replicons observed in α- and β-proteobacteria termed “chromids”  <cit> . alternatively, the psz <dig> genes predicted to contribute to plasmid stability, such as the partitioning atpase  or the toxin-antitoxin cluster  may be effective at maintaining the plasmid.

origins of psz <dig> genes and horizontal gene transfer
sequence analyses of psz <dig> genes involved in plasmid maintenance or recombination, cobalamin biosynthesis, and amino acid biosynthesis suggested that a significant portion of the plasmid originated from outside the geobacteraceae. the protein encoded by the putative hipa  shares 75% aa identity with a homolog encoded on the large plasmid  of p. propionicus. the psz <dig> replication protein, repa, shows only distant phylogenetic relatedness with its geobacter and pelobacter homologs  and the repa locus has an atypical codon usage  for both the sz chromosome and plasmid. the psz <dig> repa protein is most similar to homologs of γ-proteobacteria , such as the repa encoded on plasmid pbi <dig>  from stentrophomonas maltophilia. the predicted plasmid-partitioning gene, para, lacks geobacteraceae or pelobacteraceae homologs altogether . additionally, glov_ <dig>  encoding a predicted vitamin b12-independent methionine synthase , lacks homologs in the geobacteraceae and is functionally redundant to the meth locus on the sz chromosome .

the psz <dig> cobalamin biosynthesis genes correspond to isofunctional homologs on the chromosomes of all geobacter spp., but gene fusions and gene order within the cobalamin biosynthesis clusters on psz <dig> are uncharacteristic of cobalamin biosynthesis gene clusters in any other geobacter genome. for instance, the gene fusions sira/cysg in the first cobalamin biosynthesis cluster and cobd/cbip in the second cluster fully align with their orthologs on the pelobacter carbinolicus chromosome, but share similarity with unfused genes encoded at distinct orfs in other geobacter genomes. the proteins encoded by genes of the first psz <dig> cobalamin biosynthesis cluster share an average of 56% aa sequence identity with their orthologs on the p. carbinolicus chromosome, higher than the average pairwise identity  between the proteomes of strain sz and p. carbinolicus. however, most of the genes in the first and second cobalamin biosynthesis clusters have normalized cais >  <dig>   suggesting the portion of psz <dig> encoding the cobalamin biosynthesis genes have resided in the sz genome for sufficient time to ameliorate to its average codon usage  <cit> .

distribution of sz-like plasmids among dechlorinating geobacter strains
a g. lovleyi strain sharing 99% 16s rrna gene identity with strain sz was isolated from the pce-to-ethene-dechlorinating consortium kb- <dig> in order to examine its plasmid complement. this geobacter isolate was found to be capable of dechlorinating pce to cis-dce, and was designated g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig>  metagenome sequencing of the kb- <dig> consortium and plasmid isolation and sequencing from the geobacter strain kb- <dig> isolate revealed that strain kb- <dig> carries a  <dig>  bp plasmid sharing high similarity with psz <dig> . although they were originally isolated from different locations and habitats , the pce-to-cis-dce dechlorinating g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig> and strain sz share highly similar plasmids. the sequence differences between psz <dig> and the kb- <dig> assembly were comprised mainly of short insertions and deletions. an intact orf encoding a recombinase on the kb- <dig> plasmid assembly corresponds to a pseudogene  with a 119 bp deletion on psz <dig>  a 136 bp insertion occurs on psz <dig> of strain sz in an intergenic region upstream of glov_ <dig> encoding a transposase. there are six apparent deletions in the kb- <dig> assembly relative to the psz <dig> dna sequence, ranging in length from 1 bp to 136 bp , but the majority of these deletions occur in positions in the assembly with two-fold sequence coverage or less, and so cannot be considered reliable. out of the  <dig> intact orfs shared between psz <dig> and the kb- <dig> assembly, only two single nucleotide polymorphisms could be found. apparently, the psz <dig> and the kb- <dig> plasmid assemblies exhibit few sequence differences and little difference in gene repertoire. likewise, the strain sz genome shares ~99% identity with metagenome contigs obtained from consortium kb- <dig>  based on the geographically- and ecologically-disparate habitats of strain sz and strain kb- <dig>  the strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming species g. lovleyi appears to be cosmopolitan.

the identification of the plasmid from strain kb- <dig> suggested that the  <dig> kbp plasmid is a shared feature of members of the organohalide-respiring geobacter clade. to test this hypothesis, primers targeting the repa plasmid maintenance gene were used to amplify the psz <dig> repa gene from members of the organohalide-respiring geobacter clade. included in the analysis were four additional g. lovleyi isolates obtained from the chlorinated ethene-contaminated site, fort lewis, whose 16s rrna gene sequences suggest a close phylogenetic relationship  with strain sz . amplicons from the repa-targeted primers of the expected size and sequence were obtained with template dna from strain sz , strain kb- <dig> , and the bdi and kb- <dig> consortia . no amplicons were obtained from any of the other organohalide-respiring geobacter isolates, suggesting that the fort lewis soil g. lovleyi isolates geo <dig> , geo <dig> , geo  <dig> , and geo <dig>  do not contain a psz77-like plasmid. the primer set geo564f/840r  <cit>  was successfully used to amplify geobacteraceae 16s rrna genes from all samples. to further verify that the fort lewis geobacter isolates lack plasmids, plasmid extractions were performed with biomass from the fort lewis g. lovleyi isolates, g. thiogenes, and g. lovleyi strain sz. only strain sz dna yielded the characteristic  <dig> kbp plasmid, and no bands indicative of a plasmid were observed in the other samples . the lack of physical dna in plasmid dna extractions from g. thiogenes and the fort lewis g. lovleyi strains were consistent with the repa-targeted pcr results, suggesting neither g. thiogenes nor the fort lewis strains contain a similar plasmid. the lack of evidence for psz77-like plasmids in several pce-respiring geobacter suggested that psz <dig> does not play a direct or obligate role in organohalide respiration. mechanisms for cobalamin biosynthesis or transport of corrinoids are essential for respiration with pce and other chlorinated ethenes  <cit> . this implies that the geobacter strains without a plasmid likely either have chromosome-encoded cobalamin biosynthesis genes or an efficient mechanism for uptake of extracellular corrinoids. while not indispensable to reductive dehalogenation across all g. lovleyi strains, psz <dig> may play an indirect adaptive role in pce respiration in strains sz and kb- <dig>  for instance, psz <dig> may be important to strains sz and kb- <dig> by allowing increased gene copy numbers or differential regulation of gene functions relevant for organohalide respiration  <cit> . the two cobalamin biosynthesis clusters on psz <dig> situated on either side of the tonb-encoding transport cluster  may thus provide strains sz and kb- <dig> with a mechanism for simultaneous regulation of both cobalamin biosynthesis and scavenging for extracellular corrinoids.

CONCLUSIONS
phylogenetic analysis and sequence features related to respiratory metabolism support the affiliation of strain sz within the geobacter genus. compared to other geobacter genomes, strain sz carries an unusually large quantity of laterally acquired dna including the genomic island with duplicated pceab gene clusters enabling strain sz to respire pce and tce. the origin of the pce-genes is unclear given that they share low similarities with their top blastp matches in desulfitobacterium spp. the frequency and mechanism of transfer of the pce genomic island are not yet understood, and as such the consequences of potential lateral transfer to non-dechlorinating geobacter spp. are unclear; however, such events are obviously relevant for bioremediation. up to 69% of strain sz genes shared their top blastp matches with other geobacter spp. or pelobacter spp. genomes . at the same time, 9% of strain sz genes did not have homologs in the sequenced representatives of the δ-proteobacteria phylum. notably, the sz conjugative pilus tra-gene cluster comprises a portion of the largest chromosomal genomic island yet described in a geobacter genome. the tra-genes may provide strain sz with a mechanism for enhanced uptake of foreign dna. compared to other geobacter genomes, strain sz possesses fewer c-type cytochrome genes with no more than  <dig> heme binding motifs, which does not appear to limit the organism’s ability to respire oxidized metal species.

a distinguishing feature of the g. lovleyi genome is psz <dig>  an extrachromosomal element carrying genes that are typically located on the chromosome in other geobacteraceae. the phylogenetic origins of the psz <dig> repa and para genes are unclear and may have been laterally acquired separately from the psz <dig> genes with chromosomal orthologs. most notable among its genes with predominantly chromosomal homologs, psz <dig> encodes  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes required for de novo cobalamin biosynthesis. although a nearly identical plasmid occurs in g. lovleyi strain kb- <dig>  not all organohalide-respiring geobacterlovleyi strains carry a non-chromosomal element, indicating that psz <dig> is not a marker for pce reductive dechlorination within this species. on the other hand, unique genes and gene clusters, particularly the pce-genes, may provide discriminative detection of pce-respiring geobacter strains.
