BACKGROUND
our understanding of the role of complement in human disease is the result of numerous studies in recent years focused on complement's mechanism of action. this has resulted in achieving important information on the role of complement as a major mediator and effector mechanism in diseases of immune and non-immune pathogenesis. complement is not only important for protection against microorganisms, but also contributes to the pathophysiology of a number of autoimmune diseases.

progress regarding the biological role of complement has been made by studying disease associations in patients with inherited complement protein deficiencies  <cit> . genetic deficiencies of complement components are a common denominator of immune and infectious diseases. deficiencies of complement components of the classical activation pathway, c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig>  all lead to increased susceptibility to bacterial infections  <cit>  and increased risk of developing autoimmune disease, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus   <cit> . the complement system consists of more than  <dig> soluble and membrane proteins and constitutes an important mediator of host defense against foreign pathogens. complement component c <dig> functions as a key regulator in the early activation phase of the classical pathway and participates in the formation of the classical pathway c <dig> convertase c4b2a  <cit> . c <dig> is also a critical component of the lectin pathway. specifically, when mannose-binding lectin  or ficolins in complex with mbl-associated serine protease  molecules bind to relevant carbohydrate molecules, this leads to activation of masp- <dig> which then may cleave both c <dig> and c <dig> thereby forming the same c <dig> convertase as in classical pathway activation  <cit> . thus, c <dig> is an important component of both the classical and the lectin pathways of complement activation and is involved in first line defense against microbial infection that is essential for detection and clearance of the invading pathogens  <cit> .

complement c <dig> deficiency is the most common genetically determined complete complement deficiency with a prevalence estimated to be approximately 1: <dig>  in individuals of caucasian ancestry  <cit> , making it a clinically important immune deficiency  <cit> . the deficiency is, in the majority of cases, caused by homozygosity for c <dig> genes having deletions in exon  <dig>  resulting in complete absence of c <dig>  or in some cases caused by other c <dig> gene mutations  <cit> 

the alternative activation pathway, which is c <dig> dependent, is generally intact in c <dig> deficiency and can trigger formation of the membrane attack complex  independently of c <dig>  <cit> . however, in the absence of c <dig>  c <dig> is, in many situations, not efficiently cleaved resulting in a limited deposition of c <dig> fragments on immune complexes and on the surface of apoptotic cells. circulating apoptotic cells become a source of self antigen for auto-antibodies that participate in the formation of immune complexes. the immune complexes are deposited throughout the body, potentially causing localized inflammatory reactions in joints and kidneys, and ultimately leading to renal disease from chronic activation of the complement system  <cit> .

in this study, we considered c <dig> replacement as a therapeutic target to explore the feasibility of restoring the complement pathway in cases of c <dig> deficiency. it has been previously proposed that purified human c <dig> could restore classical and lectin complement pathways and hemolytic activity ex-vivo in serum collected from c2-deficient patients  <cit> . two case histories have been described where regular infusions of fresh frozen plasma were beneficial in patients with c2-deficiency and sle; this benefit was ascribed to the c <dig> contained in the fresh frozen plasma  <cit> . therefore, we hypothesized that recombinant human complement component c <dig>  could restore complement activity in serum from c2-deficient patients. to test this hypothesis we have expressed and purified rhc <dig> and assessed complement activation in vitro. to our knowledge this is the first report of proof of concept for treating c <dig> deficiency with recombinant human c <dig> 

RESULTS
protein cloning and expression
the rhc <dig> was highly expressed in human cells and shown to be purified very efficiently by a 2-step column chromatography process  based on a modification and improvement of a procedure previously described  <cit>  . after purification, a major band, representing rhc <dig>  is visible by coomassie staining as well as a smaller band, c2b, the inactive part of the cleaved c <dig>  which co-purifies with the full length protein and constitutes a minor impurity. c2a is completely removed during the purification process. an early report on c <dig> analysis indicates that the mature protein has eight glycosylation sites  <cit> . to determine post-translational modification of rhc <dig> we performed a glycodigestion with peptide n-glycosidase and show that rhc <dig> is glycosylated when produced in human cells . neuramidase digestion of the protein also demonstrated the presence of sialic acid on rhc <dig> , which may result in greater stability of the protein in serum  <cit> . by multi angle static light scattering  the weight average molar mass  of the full length rhc <dig> including glycosylation was determined to be  <dig>  g/mol . the number average molar mass  can also be determined by sec-mals, with the ratio mw/mn providing a measure of polydispersity. the polydispersity index of rhc <dig> is  <dig> , indicating narrow mass distribution. the line in figure  <dig> represents the differential refractive index  versus elution time, indicating the elution of rhc <dig>  the data points in figure  <dig> are the molar mass determined from the light scattering intensity using the concentration measured by dri for the glycoprotein complex, and the absorbance at  <dig> nm for the protein component. the molar mass of the protein component was  <dig>  g/mol and the difference in the two masses was the weight of the modifiers  which was  <dig>  g/mol. the  <dig>  g/mol mass of the protein without any modifiers was consistent with the expected molecular weight calculated from the protein sequence of ~  <dig> kda. the purity of rhc <dig> determined by size exclusion chromatography  was greater than 95%  with minor impurities consisting mainly of c2b, characterized also by maldi-tof analysis .

differential scanning calorimetry  showed a single temperature induced unfolding transition with a temperature midpoint  of  <dig> °c . the ratio of the calorimetric enthalpy  to the van't hoff enthalpy  was  <dig> , consistent with the three structural domains of rhc <dig> unfolding in a single transition. surveys comparing tm and Δh at various ph values and salt concentrations indicate that rhc <dig> is most stable at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> mm nacl .

rhc <dig> is cleaved by c1s and is active in c <dig> depleted serum
as a first step in the activation of the classical complement pathway, complement protein c1q binds to antibodies and triggers the activation of c1r and c1s. activated complement factor c1s cleaves c <dig> and c <dig> so they can form the c <dig> convertase thereby triggering the terminal portion of the complement cascade  <cit> . therefore, in order for c <dig> to be fully functional, it must first be cleaved by c1s. cleavage of c <dig> results in release of c2a  which in association with c4b serves as the c <dig> convertase. a smaller protein, c2b , is also released following cleavage by c1s. to determine that rhc <dig> exhibited the correct functional conformation, purified protein was incubated with purified c1s and the resultant proteins visualized by sds-page and coomassie staining . results from these studies show that rhc <dig> is cleaved by c1s, releasing c2a and c2b proteins of the correct molecular weight. c <dig> purified from human plasma was included as a positive control. these data suggest that rhc <dig> forms the correct functional conformation to activate the classical complement pathway.

to determine whether rhc <dig> was able to restore complement activation through the classical pathway, purified recombinant protein was diluted in affinity depleted c2-deficient serum  and tested using the total complement  elisa. the 3-pathway elisa measures the ability of complement proteins in a given serum sample to activate the classical, lectin or alternative pathway based on specific antigens used to trigger each pathway of the cascade. results show the specific reconstitution of the classical and lectin complement pathways when rhc <dig> was added to the c2-depleted serum but these pathways were not activated in the absence of rhc <dig> . an rhc <dig> concentration of  <dig> μg/ml restored > 50% classical pathway activity, with 100% activation at  <dig> μg/ml. as expected, the alternative pathway, which is independent of c <dig>  was activated by c2-depleted serum. an irrelevant protein  with similar mw was used as negative control and did not activate the complement pathway.

c <dig> deposition on bacterial pathogen streptococcus pneumoniae
susceptibility to encapsulated bacterial pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis and haemophilus influenzae is a hallmark of c <dig> deficiency, particularly in young children  . the classical complement pathway plays a key role in the clearance of these pathogens through antibody and non-antibody-mediated mechanisms. complement activation by antibodies to encapsulated bacterial pathogens results in the deposition of c3b on the surface of the bacterium in association with c <dig> cleavage by the c4b2a complex. in the absence of c <dig>  only c4b is bound to the bacterial cells as a result of the classical pathway activation initiated by the specific antibodies. the addition of  <dig> μg/ml rhc <dig> or c <dig> purified from plasma to c2-deficient serum increased the c3d deposition on streptococcus pneumoniae to levels similar to those using a pool of normal serum . thus, we could demonstrate that addition of c <dig> to c2-deficient serum highly increased the c <dig> fragment deposition on the bacteria. figure 5b shows flow cytometry plot of c <dig> fragment deposition using a serum sample from a c2-deficient patient serum before and after restitution with rhc2

reconstitution of classical pathway activity in serum from c2-deficient patients
considering rhc <dig> as a therapeutic alternative for c <dig> deficiency-associated diseases, it was important to test the concept in serum collected from human patients homozygous for c <dig> deficiency. we have used the 3-pathway elisa that measures complement cascade activation as well as a hemolytic assay that measures classical pathway activity by determining the ability of serum complement proteins to bind to antibody-coated sheep red blood cells. successful activation of the classical pathway results in formation of the mac and red blood cell lysis. serum from six different c2-deficient patients was reconstituted with rhc <dig> and tested in the 3-pathway elisa according to the manufacturer's instructions and three c2-deficient sera were also analyzed by the hemolytic assay  <cit> . in addition, rhc <dig> was titrated and tested in c2-deficient serum from patients in the 3-pathway elisa to investigate the minimum amount of protein needed to restore classical pathway activity to levels similar to those in pooled normal human serum.

results from the 3-pathway elisa and hemolytic assay show that rhc <dig> restores the capacity of c2-deficient patient serum for classical pathway activation enabling the formation of the mac . titration of rhc <dig> revealed that a concentration of  <dig>  -  <dig>  μg/ml was sufficient to activate the classical complement pathway to ≥70% activity of normal human serum in different c2-deficient patient sera . as a reference, normal human serum from healthy individuals contains  <dig> -  <dig> μg/ml of circulating c <dig>  no activation of the lectin pathway was observed in most of these patient sera due to low serum levels of mbl .

discussion
in this study we provide proof of concept that rhc <dig> produced in human cells could be considered as an alternative treatment for c2-deficient diseases. this concept was originally formulated by ruddy et al  <cit> , where in an ex-vivo experiment they reconstituted hemolytic activity of c2-deficient serum collected from a patient by adding c <dig> purified from normal human serum. we have expanded this concept further and have demonstrated that rhc <dig> can be expressed in high quantities from human cells. we have prepared highly purified rhc <dig>  shown that it undergoes post-translational modification and that it is very stable. rhc <dig> is cleaved in-vitro by c1s protease generating the active subunit of c <dig>  necessary to form the c <dig> convertase c4b2a and more importantly, it restores the classical and lectin pathways in c2-depleted and c2-deficient serum at different concentrations. the fact that we were able to show normalization of complement activation at concentrations of rhc <dig>  that are lower than those typically observed in normal human serum  is in accordance with the reports that the heterozygous c2-deficiency state is not a risk factor for disease  <cit> , and confirms that the rhc <dig> is fully functional.

to our knowledge this is the first report to date describing the production, purification and functional activity of rhc <dig> produced in human cells. in previous reports c <dig> was either from plasma of human or animal origin or from mouse l-cells or monkey cos cells  <cit> . the advantage of expressing c <dig> in human cells is that it may result in a more naturally glycosylated protein; most likely very similar or identical to the human c <dig> secreted in normal individuals, which is, in our opinion, an important consideration for the development of a therapeutic protein. we have also shown that rhc <dig> restores the classical pathway activation in-vitro in c2-deficient serum obtained from six different patients. the use of c2-deficient human serum represents the proof of concept for therapeutic use of rhc <dig> as an alternative therapy for c <dig> deficiency-associated diseases. restoration of the classical pathway in human c2-deficient serum with rhc <dig> could be an important step, for instance, in treating c2-deficient sle patients refractory to current therapies. interestingly, it has been previously reported in two patients that infusion of normal fresh frozen plasma as a source of complement c <dig> provided therapeutic benefit  <cit> . immunological studies performed in one of these patients revealed that these infusions led to increased serum c <dig> levels, increased hemolytic activity, decreased immune precipitation and decreased circulating immune complexes  <cit> . although it has been argued that the observed clinical effects of fresh frozen plasma were a result of multiple components in the plasma  other than c <dig>  it has been demonstrated that treatment with igg only in the amount corresponding to one course of plasma infusion  <cit>  did not have any beneficial effect, suggesting that the key player in promoting complement activity through the classical pathway, was c <dig> alone. in addition, infusion of rhc <dig> may decrease the risk of developing adverse reactions compared to plasma infusion as plasma contains many proteins that may trigger different reactions in patients.

the therapeutic use of rhc <dig> could also be considered in the case of c2-deficient individuals with recurrent or invasive bacterial infections. it has been shown that c <dig> deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to recurrent infections by encapsulated bacterial pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> . complement activation resulting in opsonization of the bacteria with c <dig> fragments is an important defense mechanism which is impaired in c <dig> deficiency  <cit> . therefore, we could envision rhc <dig> as an adjunct therapy to antibiotics, with the rhc <dig> facilitating phagocyte-mediated clearance of the pathogen by enabling full complement cascade activation.

blood protein replacement therapy is well established in some clinical situations, for example, intravenous immunoglobulin in patients with antibody deficiencies or coagulation factors in the hemophilias and specific lysosomal hydrolases in lysosomal storage diseases  <cit> . drotrecogin alpha, a recombinant form of activated protein c, is approved for use in sepsis and diffuse intravascular coagulation. the only complement replacement therapy already established is in hereditary angioedema caused by c1-inhibitor deficiency. plasma-derived c1-inhibitor is shown to be an efficient treatment  <cit>  and recombinant c1-inhibitor is under clinical evaluation  <cit> . another complement protein that has been tried as replacement therapy is mbl in patients with mbl deficiency and clinical disease, related to the deficiency. plasma-derived mbl has been used  <cit>  and recently recombinant mbl was shown to successfully restore the mbl activation pathway in vivo  <cit> . thus, all together these examples suggest that c <dig> replacement therapy could be considered for further evaluation of possible therapeutic use in humans. recombinant human proteins offer many benefits over purified products from pooled human plasma, such as a lower risk of transmission of infectious diseases and higher batch-to-batch consistency  <cit> . therefore, it was important to show that rhc <dig> can substitute for endogenously produced c <dig> in its immune and anti-infective effects. the present report shows that rhc <dig> is fully functional in vitro and can be considered for protein replacement therapy in c <dig> deficiency-associated diseases.

CONCLUSIONS
we have demonstrated that a biochemically well characterized recombinant human complement component c <dig> produced in a human cell line restores classical complement pathway activation in vitro, in serum from c2-deficient patients. establishing efficacy in specific animal models for sle and infectious diseases will further validate this concept; although the present study provides the first evidence for protein replacement therapy as a treatment of diseases related to c <dig> deficiency.
