BACKGROUND
previous studies reported different species and species distribution patterns in different coastal and open ocean environments, climates, distances from seashores, and sea depths  <cit> . dinsdale and colleagues  <cit>  described different prokaryotic and viral communities across  <dig> coral atolls of the northern line islands, influenced by oceanographic conditions and human activities associated with land-use and fishing. human activities are considered a major factor driving microbial structure changes  <cit> . somboonna et al.  <cit>  reported that two opposite coastal niches of the non-vast sichang island with different degrees of manmade pollutions contained diverse microbial structures. furthermore, seasonal variation affects the microbial diversity. studies described the repeatable seasonal dynamic of the microbial structures in temperate coastal water of n <dig>  w <dig>  with peak biodiversity in the winter season  <cit> . yet, the seasonal dynamic of the microbial structure of the tropical coral reef remains unrevealed.

coral reefs of tropical waters between 30°n and 30°s are generally around shallow depth. this shallow-water reef zone, known as reef surface, is affected by the surge of water tides that further enhances the biodiversity. although coral reefs cover less than 1% of the earth’s surface, they are home to approximately 25% of marine fish species  <cit> . corals, coral animals and microbiota have intricate relationship. for instances, coral animals and microbiota could protect the corals from water temperature rise, pollution, and also from specific pathogens by filling entry niches and/or producing antibiotics  <cit> . changing of microbial associates could help the coral animals adapt to altering coral niches  <cit> . in contrast, coral bleaching causes change to the microbial community balance  <cit> . thus, it is of importance to understand these dramatically fruitful marine microbial communities.

currently, culture-independent method has been in widespread use to obtain microbial databases for marine and other various environmental resources  <cit> . this derived the global ocean sampling exploration  project that was launched in  <dig> by jc venter to gain understanding of microbial diversity for entire marine environments, including coastal water, open ocean, seafloor and seawater at different depths  <cit> . while no study for culture-independent microbial diversity of any coral reef environment in thai maritime has been established, this study represents the first to use 16s and 18s rrna pyrosequencing with metagenomic dna to identify the summer and winter microbial structures and their metabolic potentials representing thailand’s tropical reef surface of kra island, helping to understand our global marine biodiversity.

being situated just above the equator makes thailand a tropical climate with great biodiversity of microbes and organisms. kra island, or ko kra, is located in the gulf of thailand at n <dig>  e <dig> , about  <dig> miles  south of bangkok and  <dig> miles  east of nakhon si thammarat province of thailand . the coral reefs around kra island are still in well-preserved condition due to the minimal anthropogenic impact, meanwhile the world’s coral reefs have been dramatically degraded in the past few decades  <cit> . kra island is uninhabited as it has a small size of less than  <dig>  square miles and is remote from the mainland.

RESULTS
general characteristics of kra reef surface
three independent water samples representing kra island reef surface were collected at n <dig>  e <dig> , n <dig>  e <dig>  and n <dig>  e <dig> , during midday in summer  and winter  seasons of thailand. all collected water samples were clean and had no abnormal smell. on-site physical and chemical property measurements of the collected water samples expressed similar ph, salinity and temperature between the two seasons, while dissolved oxygen was higher and suspension solids were fewer in the winter .

following a two-step water filtration system to capture marine microbes or particles of  <dig> - <dig> microns in diameters  <cit>  and total nucleic acids extraction, the average metagenomic dna retrieved for the summer and the winter samples were  <dig>  and  <dig>  nanogram per millilitre of seawater, respectively.

species compositions at domain and taxon levels
libraries of summer and winter 16s and 18s rrna genes sequences were successfully constructed and sequenced:  <dig>  total reads were classified into  <dig>  reads for summer 16s rrnas,  <dig>  for winter 16s rrnas,  <dig>  for summer 18s rrnas, and  <dig>  for winter 18s rrnas. the average number of reliable reads  was  <dig> % and the average read length was  <dig> nucleotides.  <dig> % of the reliable reads could be identified by blastn against ncbi  <cit> , rdp  <cit>  and greengenes  <cit>  for 16s rrna genes; and ncbi  <cit> , embl  <cit>  and silva  <cit>  for 18s rrna genes. similarly, analysis by mg-rast   <cit>  revealed high numbers of reliable reads:  <dig> % for summer and  <dig> % for winter.comparing between bacteria and eukarya domains using mg-rast, bacteria domain was more present than eukarya in both seasons, although the great proportion of eukaryota was found in the winter . different taxonomic compositions between the seasons were demonstrated: summer mainly comprised taxons proteobacteria, unclassified , actinobacteria, firmicutes, mullusca, cyanobacteria, arthopoda, nematoda, brachiopoda, and annelida, in orderly. the winter mainly comprised of taxons proteobacteria, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, unclassified , arthropoda, unclassified , chordata, firmicutes, and apicomplexa .

it is important to note that the varied pyrosequencing depths between summer and winter 16s and 18s rrna datasets were normalized by random selection of equal number of reads from both summer and winter seasons for comparative analysis of microbial communities.  <dig>  random reads of each 16s and  <dig>  reads of each 18s rrna datasets were examined for distributions by taxons  and phyla . these distribution patterns were similar to those computed using the entire datasets . the normalization analyses were independently performed twice, and the results remained the same. additionally, rarefaction cures of the number of phyla on the y-axis against the number of random reads on the x-axis were constructed for 16s and 18s rrna datasets, and the plateau curves showing relatively no new phyla at these sequencing depths were observed for the 16s and 18s rrna data.

each identified read was classified in its corresponding phylum. the proportional percentage of each phylum was calculated by dividing the number of the identified reads in a phylum with the total number of the identified reads.

prokaryotic diversity of summer and winter kra reef surface
as an additional analysis to the mg-rast analysis for domain and taxon compositions, the 16s rrna sequence profiles of summer and winter kra prokaryotes were species annotated by blastn  <cit>  with e-value threshold ≤10− <dig> against ncbi non-redundant  <cit> , rdp  <cit>  and greengenes  <cit>  databases. with added databases, most unclassified  by mg-rast analysis became annotated. the summer profile demonstrated an overwhelming proportion of proteobacteria , whereas the winter profile constituted the higher phyla diversity: proteobacteria , bacteroidetes , and the greater proportion of actinobacteria  and firmicutes  than those in the summer . prokaryotic phyla, including cyanobacteria, sar <dig>  planctomycetes and sbr <dig>  were only detected in the winter . sar <dig>  represents uncultured bacteria that were previously discovered in atlantic and pacific oceans. its full-length 16s rrna phylogeny was not clustered with any bacterial phyla except was a distant relative to genera fibrobacter  and chlorobium   <cit> . sbr <dig>  represents uncultured bacteria which previous research found in wastewater treatment plants with biological nutrient removal  <cit> .

within the same phyla, the summer and winter kra reef surface prokaryotic communities showed further characteristic species compositions as determined by low community structure relatedness lennon  and yue & clayton  theta similarity indices. species predominated in the summer were uncultured proteobacteria sp., erwinia sp., nautella italica, vibrio sp. and vibrio splendidus; meanwhile species predominated in the winter were pectobacterium carotovorum, pseudoalteromonas sp., marine bacterium, sulfitobacter sp., croceibacter atlanticus and flavobacteria bacterium . marine bacterium represents one taxon name in greengenes database, including isolates vs05_ <dig> , b <dig>  and ks-9-10- <dig> , for instances.

eukaryotic diversity of summer and winter kra reef surface
as an additional analysis to the mg-rast, the 18s rrna sequence profiles of summer and winter kra prokaryotes were also species annotated by blastn  <cit>  with e-value ≤10− <dig> against ncbi non-redundant  <cit> , embl  <cit>  and silva  <cit>  databases and many additional unclassified  by mg-rast were defined. table 2b demonstrated the fewer eukaryotic phyla diversity in the summer than in the winter.

while fungal phyla were not abundant and thus did not demonstrate much difference, the compositional structures of the protist, plant and animal phyla were greatly different between the seasons . overall, animals brachiopoda, mollusca and annelida, and protists dinophyta, constituted  <dig> % of the total phyla compositions in the summer. on the other hand, plants bacillariophyta and stramenopiles constituted  <dig> % of all phyla in the winter. indeed, several plant phyla were missing in the summer .

within the same phyla, the summer and winter kra reef surface eukaryotic communities showed further characteristic species compositions as determined by low lennon  and yue & clayton  theta similarity indices. these similarity indices were even lower than those belonged the 16s rrna profiles. species predominated in the summer were dinophysis acuminata , myrina sp. , glycymeris pedunculata , lingula anatina , ctenodrilidae sp.  and hyotissa numisma . species predominated in the winter were nanofrustulum shiloi , climacosphenia moniligera , corethron criophilum , corethron hystrix , pirsonia diadema , and trichoplax sp. , for examples .

metabolic subsystem analysis of bacterial communities in summer and winter kra reef surface
a total of  <dig> metabolic subsystems were found in summer and winter bacterial communities of kra reef surface. figure 6a demonstrated quite similarities in the distribution of these  <dig> subsystems between seasons, except in the subsystem of dormancy and sporulation that were more preponderated in the winter season. overall, the main bacterial metabolic subsystems entailed carbohydrates, clustering-based subsystems, and amino acids and derivatives, respectively. analysis of the distributions of functional groups within each subsystem showed that summer contained higher functional groups in: aromatic amino acids and derivatives ; polysaccharides ; catabolism of an unknown compound, probably organic hydroperoxide resistance related hypothetical protein, probably ybbk-related hypothetical membrane proteins, proteosome related, shiga toxin cluster ; coenzyme m ; anaerobic degradation of aromatic compounds ; desiccation stress ; invasion and intracellular resistance, toxins and superantigens . for the winter the higher functional groups were: gram-positive cell wall components ; dna metabolism, nucleotidyl-phosphate metabolic cluster, recombination related cluster, recx and regulatory cluster, related to menaquinon-cytochrome c reductase, two related proteases ; dna uptake, competence ; spore dna protection ; protein translocation across cytoplasmic membrane ; light-harvesting complexes ; bacteriocins, ribosomally synthesized antibacterial peptides  .

global comparative analyses of prokaryotic profiles representing summer and winter kra reef surface against coastal tha wang and tham phang of sichang island,  <dig> gos sites, and  <dig> northern line islands sites
similarity between pairs of prokaryotic community structures were determined by theta similarity coefficients yue & clayton  and smith , using mothur  <cit> . these similarity coefficients were used for principle coordinate analysis  and un-weighted pair group method with arithmetic mean clustering . results indicated the prokaryotic communities between the summer and winter kra reef surface were most closely related, followed by coastal tha wang and tham phang of sichang island, gs <dig> , gs <dig> , gs <dig> , respectively . specifically, the similarity coefficients revealed that the winter prokaryotic community of the kra reef surface was more closely related to those of tha wang  and tham phang  than the summer. in contrast, the summer rather than the winter kra reef surface prokaryotic community was more closely related to those of gs <dig> , gs <dig>  and gs <dig> .figure  <dig> compared the prokaryotic phyla distributions among kra reef surface, sichang island coast and the three related gos communities. the relatedness between the winter kra and the coastal sichang prokaryotic communities was associated by the great presentation of proteobacteria and bacteroidetes, and the shared presence of cyanobacteria, planctomycetes, sar <dig> and sbr <dig>  the relatedness between the summer kra and gs <dig>  gs <dig> and gs <dig> prokaryotic communities involved the rather restraint phyla distribution of simply proteobacteria and bacteroidetes . figure  <dig> also revealed the more diversified prokaryotic phyla in thai marine habitats: tha wang followed by tham phang, winter kra reef surface, summer kra reef surface, gs <dig>  gs <dig> and gs <dig>  respectively.

discussion
to unravel the microbial biodiversity in the tropical reef surface of kra island, a home of fruitful corals, and surrounding animals and plants, this present study was conducted to obtain the prokaryotic and eukaryotic databases for the summer and winter seasons of this coral reef surface. free-living microorganisms and particles of approximately  <dig> -30 μm in diameter were captured, their metagenomes were extracted, and high number of reliable reads  and respectable read length  were retrieved.

total 16s and 18s rrna gene analyses showed that bacteria the major domain of lives in this marine habitat , supporting the fact that bacteria are ubiquitous on almost every environment  <cit> . meanwhile, archaea was not found in this marine habitat, consistent with current gos analysis and previous literatures that reported  <dig> to < <dig> % archaea in typical marine microbial community  <cit> . current gos reported 0% archaea in estuary marine,  <dig> % open-ocean, and  <dig> % coastal water   <cit> . wegley et al.  <cit>  reported <1% archaea in coral fragments. as archaea should be more present in contaminated and polluted water environments  <cit> , the absence of archaea might in part highlight the cleanliness and non-polluted kra coral reef water, allowing bacteria to be overpopulated.

as previous studies found that not only local environmental factors like sunlight, sea depth and substrate inclination but also seasons could exert a strong influence on the structural and functional biodiversity of coral benthic communities  <cit> , our data demonstrated season could impact different microbial population structures and functions. the differences appeared since the domain and taxon distribution patterns . the greater bacterial proportion in the summer  was perhaps associated with its less abundant eukaryotes. the less animal disturbance due to time of dormancy and sporulation in the winter might support the growth of photosynthetic lives, and thus the biodiversity of eukaryotes in the winter.

for bacteria, the study found proteobacteria to be predominant in the summer, while not only proteobacteria but also bacteroidetes were prevalent in the winter . changing pattern of bacterial phyla composition was consistent with recent findings by gilbert and colleagues  <cit> , stating microbial communities did change over time, between seasons, and between day and night. in addition, the greater bacterial diversity in the winter  was consistent with these 6-year analyses of the bacterial structures, representing the coastal western english channel  <cit>  and the coastal plymouth in uk  <cit> , that proved the bacterial diversity was highest in winter and at night, and showed season as one important factor for microbial diversity. note these studies used the same experimental methods as ours. furthermore, most bacterial phyla detected in the winter kra reef surface were also found on the coral fragments from bocas del toro, panama    <cit> . note this study was, again, conducted using the same method as ours, and the different bacterial compositions between this and ours could be attributed to different marine geography and sampling time.

the prevalence of bacteriodetes  in the winter kra reef surface was not uncommon, as this phyla was also found in various marine environments  <cit> . species in this phyla could serve marine lives pathogens and opportunistic human pathogens, for examples, croceibacter atlanticus, flavobacterium sp. and psychroserpens sp. . c. atlanticus in a family flavobacteriaceae was isolated from bermuda atlantic ocean  <cit> . this species and other flavobacterium sp. could cause fish diseases and are opportunistic pathogens for humans due to, for instance, their chorismate biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . psychroserpens sp. is also in a family flavobacteriaceae, and was found strictly associated with some fish diseases, such as amoebic gill disease  <cit> . yet, bacterial pathogens were also noticed in the summer. vibrio sp.  and pectobacterium carotovorum  could cause diseases in marine animals and plants, respectively   <cit> . vibrio sp. in undercooked seafood serves as a frequent cause of foodborne diseases in humans  <cit> . hence, summer and winter kra reef surface contained species that might be pathogenic to marine lives and humans.

additionally, the findings of sar <dig> and sbr <dig>  which are relatives of green sulfur bacteria chlorobium, in the winter , though supported the diversity peak in the winter, might pose a threat. the reason was because chlorobium could live in harsh-living conditions and could out-compete the growth of other photosynthetic microbes in restricted nutrient condition. chlorobium is a photolithotrophic oxidizer of sulfur, and could also produce huge quantities of methane and hydrogen sulfide, causing global warming and acid rain  <cit> . in thailand, chlorobium was previously reported in a human-polluted tha wang coast of sichang island  <cit> . overall, the low lennon and yue & clayton theta similarity indices represented the dynamic of bacterial compositions between summer and winter seasons.

in support of the aforementioned results and previous reports  <cit> , the greatly diversified eukaryotic phyla and species, except for fungi, were found in the winter . fungi were presented in a minor portion in both seasons, although their function could involve nutrient recycling like bacteria yet some could serve pathogens to the marine lives in the food webs  <cit> . because several fungal species are not independent-living, the 2-step filtration method that selected for ~ <dig> -30 μm microorganisms or particles  did not target these living-dependent fungi. however, the filtration method is widely practiced among metagenomic scientists  <cit> , serving as an appropriate method for collection of microbial-size organisms and particles in the seawater.

plant species, mainly climacosphenia moniligera from phylum bacillariophyta , were abundant in the winter. these unicellular diatoms were found commonly along the corals, and could function as producer to this food chain  <cit> . thus, the abundant plant species might infer the more productive coral ecosystem during the winter. on the other hand, the larger proportion of animal species in the summer  could likely be extracellular dna, as many detected animals were of larger size than 30 μm. a significant proportion of brachiopods lingula anatina in the summer  was questionable; perhaps marine animal activities were so high in the summer that their extracellular dnas from larvae or any dead debris were detected  <cit> . the explicit differences in the 18s rrna gene profiles between these seasons resulted in the very low lennon and yue & clayton theta similarity indices.

as coral microorganisms could help the coral animals to adjust to altering niches  <cit> , the metabolic potentials for the summer and winter kra reef surface bacterial communities were revealed to better understand this coral reef surface biodiversity pattern and its species-species interactions.  <dig> metabolic subsystems were discovered. subsystems of carbohydrates, clustering-based subsystems, and amino acids and derivatives, were highly presented in both seasons, as these subsystems were important for any ecosystem. finding of the greater dormancy and sporulation rate in the winter  supported the general knowledge of this season for animal dormancy and sporulation. functional groups of membrane transport and photosynthesis that were higher in the winter  suggested the enriched food chain, supporting the diversity peak. these changes in key subsystems  among seasons were consistent with previous studies by gilbert et al.  <cit>  and our water property measurements showing the greater percent dissolved oxygen and lower suspension solids in the winter . further, algae could stimulate bacterial respiration, and were found greater in the winter  <cit> . consequently, changes in bacterial patterns between seasons have intricate relationships with other marine lives, and affect the metabolic potentials of the ecosystems potentially in a way characteristic to individual seasons.

finally, the prokaryotic profiles representing kra reef surface were compared to our thai marine datasets, coastal tha wang and tham phang of sichang island,  <dig> gos and  <dig> northern line islands datasets. the closer prokaryotic community structures between the kra reef surface and the sichang island  highlighted community relatedness due to oceanographic position . the next close community structures gs <dig>  gs <dig> and gs <dig> were also probable, since these three sites represent open ocean tropical south pacific at coordinates s <dig>  w <dig>  , s <dig>  w <dig>  , and s <dig>  w <dig>  , respectively   <cit> . these oceanographies shared relatively warm temperature of above 25°c. the great prokaryotic diversity of sichang islands, and also the kra reef surface although with the less degree , highlighted the rich microbial biodiversity in the thai maritime zone.

the present study provided complete independent-living prokaryotic and eukaryotic profiles of  <dig> -30 μm of summer and winter kra reef surface. still, time series and rainy season analyses could be performed next to understand the seasonal pattern of the kra reef surface community. also, microbial communities of the corals and the coral sediments should be determined to gain complete understanding of the coral reef ecosystem at the kra island.

CONCLUSIONS
summer and winter showed differences in species richness and evenness in kra reef surface prokaryotic and small eukaryotic populations. the 16s and 18s rrna gene databases serve as the baseline for future studies of coral reef microbes in thai maritime, helping to elucidate association of microbes in differing oceanography and human impacts. additionally, the data helped understand how kra reef surface microbial community and metabolic potentials are associated with seasons and those of the other marine ecosystems worldwide.
