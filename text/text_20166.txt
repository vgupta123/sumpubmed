BACKGROUND
dna helicases are essential for genome stability. they have critical roles in dna replication, repair and recombination. multiple human hereditary disorders are linked to mutations in helicase genes. for example, mutations in three of the five human recq helicases are associated with increased cancer risk and/or premature aging  <cit> . a point mutation in the human pif <dig>  dna helicase  is present in certain families with increased risk of breast cancer and not detected in unaffected controls  <cit> . this mutation changes a conserved residue within the 21-amino acid pif <dig> signature motif that characterizes this family of dna helicases  <cit> .

pif <dig> family helicases are found in the genomes of organisms from all three kingdoms  <cit> . most eukaryotes, including schizosaccharomyces pombe and humans, encode a single pif <dig> family helicase, while saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes two, scpif <dig> and scrrm <dig>  pfh <dig>  the s. pombe pif <dig> helicase, is essential for maintenance of both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes  <cit> . in nuclear dna, it facilitates replication fork progression through many sites that impede fork progression, such as highly transcribed rna polymerase ii and iii genes, replication fork barriers within both the ribosomal dna  and the mating-type locus, and converged replication forks  <cit> . at the mating type locus and rdna, pfh <dig> helps forks move past stable protein complexes. in the absence of pfh <dig>  double strand breaks  occur specifically at these natural fork impediments  <cit> .

pfh1’s role at a different class of hard to replicate sites, stable non-canonical dna secondary structures such as the g-quadruplex , has not been systematically explored. g <dig> structures are stable dna secondary structures held together by multiple stacked guanine quartets  <cit> . g <dig> structures can form within a single dna molecule  or between different dna molecules . in virtually all genomes examined so far, dna sequences that are capable of forming intra-strand g <dig> structures in vitro  are observed. g <dig> motifs are highly enriched in g-rich telomeric dna, where they affect telomerase action and end protection  <cit> . in addition to telomeres, there are more than  <dig>  sites in the human genome with the potential to form g <dig> dna  <cit> , and g <dig> structures can be detected in human cultured cells with g <dig> specific antibodies  <cit> . moreover, g <dig> structures were more frequent in fancj helicase-deficient human cultured cells  <cit> . in bacteria, budding yeast, and humans, g <dig> motifs are common in rdna and promoter regions  <cit> .

although g <dig> motifs are not frequent sites of dna damage in wild type  s. cerevisiae, in pif <dig> mutant cells, replication forks slow and often break at these sites  <cit> . in wt cells, scpif <dig> binds a subset of g <dig> motifs, and this subset is more likely to be associated with fork slowing and dna breakage in its absence. moreover, in cells lacking scpif <dig>  g <dig> motifs induce gross-chromosomal rearrangements   <cit> . although g <dig> motifs do not induce genome instability in rrm <dig> cells, g4-induced gcr events are particularly elevated in pif <dig> rrm <dig> cells, suggesting that scrrm <dig> acts as a backup for scpif <dig> in suppressing g4-induced dna damage. consistent with a role for scpif <dig> at g <dig> motifs in vivo, scpif <dig> and four of four tested bacterial pif <dig> helicases are particularly robust unwinders of g <dig> structures, even under single-cycle conditions  <cit> . in human cells, some of the binding sites of the g <dig> stabilizing agent pyridostatin, co-localize with the binding of hpif <dig>  suggesting a role of hpif <dig> in resolving g <dig> dna  <cit> .

here, we investigated the relationship between g <dig> motifs and the s. pombe pfh <dig> helicase. compared to s. cerevisiae, s. pombe has a chromosome structure more similar to that of higher eukaryotes and, like human cells, encodes a single pif <dig> family helicase. thus, it is a good model for understanding the functions of hpif <dig>  we used computational methods to map intra-strand g <dig> motifs within the genome of s. pombe and three other sequenced schizosaccaromyces yeasts to determine their association with genomic features. g <dig> motifs were significantly enriched in rdna, telomeres, meiotic dsb hot spots, gene promoters, nucleosome-depleted regions , untranslated regions , and dubious open reading frames , but depleted in orfs. using chromatin immunoprecipitation in combination with deep sequencing , we found that pfh <dig> was bound near approximately 20% of the g <dig> motifs in the assembled s. pombe nuclear genome and that fork slowing and dna damage, as indicated by association with cdc <dig>  the leading strand dna polymerase, and phosphorylated h2a , respectively, were associated with g <dig> motifs in pfh1-depleted cells. together, our data suggest that pfh <dig> is needed to unwind g <dig> structures; when this unwinding does not occur, forks slow and often break. this increased genome instability in pfh1-depleted cells could explain the association of hpif <dig> mutations with cancer.

RESULTS
identifying g <dig> motifs in fission yeasts
we performed a genome-wide search for dna sequences with the potential to form g <dig> structures on the genomes of the four available schizosaccaromyces species  <cit> . we identified all sequences that contain four runs of three or more guanine base pairs , ‘g-islands’, separated by ‘loop’ regions of no more than 25 bp 3 g≥ <dig>  <cit> . hereafter, sequences matching this pattern are called ‘g <dig> motifs’. regions with more than four g-islands separated by ≤25 bp were counted as a single g <dig> motif. excluding repetitive dna , the s. pombe genome contained 446 g <dig> motifs that match this query pattern with a density of  <dig>  g <dig> motifs/kilobase  . the density of g <dig> motifs was similar across all three s. pombe chromosomes . the s. octosporus and s. cryophilus genomes contained a similar number and density of g <dig> motifs as s. pombe . the more distantly related s. japonicus had roughly four times the number  and density  of g <dig> motifs as the other fission yeast species, most likely due to the higher gc content of its genome .figure  <dig>

the above estimates for the number of g <dig> motifs do not include g <dig> motifs within repetitive telomeric dna and most of the rdna. telomeric dna was not included in this analysis because it is not in the s. pombe genome assembly. however, analysis of s. pombe telomeric dna in a library containing 18 kb of sequenced telomeric dna  revealed that it had two orders of magnitude more g <dig> motifs per kb  than bulk nuclear dna . the presence of g <dig> motifs in telomeric dna is not surprising as the s. pombe telomeric sequence, g2-8ttac, is gc-rich  <cit> . however, the density is nearly three times higher than expected in random sequences of the same gc content . assuming 300 bps of telomeric dna at each of the six chromosome ends, we estimate  <dig> to 2 g <dig> motifs per telomere or approximately  <dig> telomeric g <dig> motifs per haploid genome.

the s. pombe genome assembly contains only three full rdna repeats, a small fraction of the estimated approximately  <dig> rdna repeats in nuclear dna  <cit> . each of the three copies of the  <dig>  kb rdna repeat had five g <dig> motifs . assuming that these g <dig> motifs are present in all of the rdna repeats, there are approximately  <dig>  g <dig> motifs in s. pombe rdna, accounting for almost 80% of the g <dig> motifs in nuclear dna. the density of g <dig> motifs in the rdna  was significantly greater than expected from random sequences of the same gc content  and more than ten times higher in rdna than the average in the nuclear genome , even though the gc content of the two is similar . each of the five rdna g <dig> motifs was on the non-transcribed strand : three were in transcribed regions, two in the 28s and one near the start of the 18s rrna. of the three g <dig> motifs in transcribed regions, the one in 18s and one of the two in 28s were conserved in sequence and position between s. pombe and s. japonicus  <cit>  . the high density of g <dig> motifs is also true for s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and human rdna  <cit> . in both s. pombe and s. cerevisiae, g <dig> motifs are found only on the non-transcribed strand  <cit> , suggesting a potential role for g <dig> structures in the rrna. however, the most highly conserved g <dig> motif, which is in the 18s rrna, does not form a g <dig> structure in an existing crystal structure of the s. cerevisiae ribosome  <cit> .

we also determined the g <dig> motif content of the mitochondrial  dna of the four fission yeast species, which range in size from  <dig>  kb in s. pombe to  <dig>  kb in s. japonicus . no g <dig> motifs were present in s. pombe or s. octosporus mtdna, while s. cryophilus and s. japonicus contained one and five motifs, respectively. these results are in sharp contrast to the very high density of g <dig> motifs in the at-rich s. cerevisiae mtdna compared to its nuclear genome   <cit> . hereafter, we will address the events that occur in the 446 g <dig> motifs found in the published s. pombe genome assembly.

evolutionary conservation of g <dig> motifs across fission yeasts
there was little evolutionary conservation of g <dig> motif locations among the four fission yeast species. in each pairwise combination, only a small number of s. pombe g <dig> motifs  overlapped a g <dig> motif in the aligned homologous location in another species . moreover, different motifs were maintained between different pairs of species. excluding the rdna repeats, only five motifs were conserved between s. pombe, s. octosporus and s. cryophilius, and only one location, the promoter of cdc13+, had a g <dig> motif in all four species.

this low level of evolutionary conservation is not surprising due to the evolutionary divergence of the available fission yeast genomes. s. octosporus, s. cryophilus and s. pombe diverged from their last common ancestor more than  <dig> million years ago , while s. japonicus diverged more than  <dig> mya  <cit> . studies of the evolutionary turnover of g <dig> motifs  <cit>  and other regulatory elements  <cit>  in yeasts find that most regulatory elements are not conserved over these timescales.

the genomic distribution of g <dig> motifs
to investigate potential functions for s. pombe g <dig> motifs, we analyzed the distribution of the g <dig> motifs with respect to multiple genomic features, such as highly expressed genes, ndrs, meiotic dsb hotspots and so on. . for these analyses, we first computed the number of overlaps between the g <dig> motifs and a given feature of interest. then, to evaluate if the observed association was more or less than expected by chance, we created  <dig>  sets of ‘control’ regions. each of these  <dig>  control sets contained  <dig> random genomic regions—one for each of the actual g <dig> motifs. each of the  <dig> regions in a single control set matched the chromosome, length and gc content of a different observed g <dig> motif, so the average region length and gc content for each of the  <dig>  sets matched that of the actual g <dig> motifs. then, for each of these  <dig>  sets of control regions, we computed the number of overlaps with the feature of interest. by comparing the number of observed g <dig> motif overlaps to the  <dig>  overlap counts from the control sets, we obtained an empirical estimate of the likelihood of the observed association by chance . to account for the testing of multiple hypotheses, for each enrichment test, we report q-values, which are the false discovery rate  analogue of p-values and correspond to the fdr if a particular test is called significant  <cit> . see methods for more information.

using this approach, we found that g <dig> motifs were significantly associated with several genomic features . g <dig> motifs were more likely to occur in the promoters of rna polymerase ii-transcribed genes , ndrs , meiotic dsb hot spots , 3′ and 5′ utrs , and within dubious genes  than expected by chance. in contrast, g <dig> motifs were significantly depleted from orfs of protein-coding genes , including essential and highly transcribed genes. however, when g <dig> motifs were found within orfs, they were significantly more likely to occur on the transcribed strand than expected by chance . in these cases, the g <dig> motif would not be present in the mrna. thus, any function of these g <dig> motifs would likely be carried out in dna. g <dig> motifs were not significantly associated with long terminal repeats , trna genes, 5s rrna genes, origins of replication or centromeres . similar association patterns were found when decreasing the loop length from 25 bp to 12 bp .table  <dig>

g <dig> motifs are enriched in promoters of pol ii transcribed orfs, ndrs, dubious orfs, utr and meiotic dsb hot spots. g <dig> motifs are depleted from orfs overall, as well as essential and highly transcribed genes. g <dig> motifs are also enriched in cdc <dig> occupied sites in pfh1-depleted cells , γh2a sites , telomeric repeats and rdna repeats .



many g <dig> motifs are pfh <dig> associated
pfh <dig> is a replisome component that moves with the leading strand polymerase ɛ . thus, we anticipated that if some  g <dig> motifs slow dna replication, even in wild type cells, they would have higher binding by both pfh <dig> and cdc <dig>  the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase ɛ. if pfh <dig> promotes replication fork progression past g <dig> motifs, the cdc <dig> association at these sites should be even higher in pfh1-depleted cells. to test these hypotheses, we used a s. pombe strain expressing epitope-tagged pfh <dig>  isolated pfh1-associated dna by immunoprecipitation , and then sequenced the associated dna . the input dna for the chip was sequenced as a control. sites with significant pfh <dig> occupancy were identified with the model-based analysis of chip-seq peak calling software , using a stringent cutoff for both chip and input dna . the same strategy was used in all of the chip-seq analyses in this paper . with these methods, we identified  <dig> high confidence pfh1-associated sites in dna from asynchronously growing cells. two of these peaks mapped to the rdna, although not to the g <dig> motifs in the rdna . the assembled s. pombe genome lacks telomeric dna, so this analysis did not assess pfh <dig> association with telomeres. however, chip-qpcr shows that telomeres were also pfh <dig> associated  <cit> .

of the  <dig> pfh <dig> peaks,  <dig>  were ≤300 bp, the shearing size of the chip dna, from a g <dig> motif. several pfh <dig> peaks were associated with more than one g <dig> motif, so in total,  <dig>  of the 446 g <dig> motifs in the assembled nuclear genome were pfh <dig> associated . the observed association between pfh <dig> and g <dig> motifs was significantly greater than expected by chance . however, it was significantly lower than expected when taking the gc-content of the g <dig> motifs into account using our control region sets . we also validated the chip-seq peaks by quantitative pcr . we compared the association of pfh1-13myc or an untagged otherwise isogenic control strain to a trna gene , a previously known pfh1-binding site  <cit> , three gc-rich sites and three g <dig> motifs . pfh <dig> was significantly associated with all these sites compared to the control strain . together, these results suggest that pfh <dig> is present not only at many g <dig> motifs but also at many other sites, especially at other gc-rich sequences, consistent with its being a multi-functional dna helicase  <cit> . this finding is also consistent with the behavior of scpif <dig>  which binds preferentially to g-rich regions, even those unable to form g <dig> structures, in vivo and in vitro  <cit> .

replication forks pause near g <dig> motifs in pfh1-depleted cells
to monitor fork progression at g <dig> motifs in the presence and absence of pfh <dig>  we epitope tagged cdc <dig> and performed chip-seq in wt and pfh1-depleted cells. although all sites in the genome are cdc20-associated at their time of replication, sites where replication forks move slowly are expected to have elevated cdc <dig> binding, as seen with dna pol <dig>  the catalytic subunit of dna polymerase ε in s. cerevisiae  <cit> . to deplete cells of pfh <dig>  an essential protein, we used the thiamine repressible nmt <dig> promoter  <cit> . growth of nmt-pfh1-gfp cells in thiamine for 12 hours reduces pfh <dig> expression, so that pfh <dig> is no longer detected by western blot analysis  <cit> . hereafter, cells treated in this way are referred to as ‘pfh1-depleted cells’ and untreated cells as ‘wt’/pfh1-expressing’ cells.

using these methods, we identified  <dig> sites of high cdc <dig> binding in wt cells, including 50 g <dig> motifs . this number of g <dig> motifs was not significantly different from the expected association based on the  <dig>  control sets . thus, in wt cells, g <dig> motifs were not enriched among sites of replication fork pausing compared to other gc-rich regions.figure  <dig> 
a subset of g <dig> motifs have high cdc <dig> binding indicative of replication fork pausing in pfh1-depleted cells.  the venn diagram gives the overlaps between g <dig> motifs associated with high pfh <dig> , high cdc <dig> in wt cells  and high cdc <dig> in pfh1-depleted cells . for the most part, g <dig> motifs with high cdc <dig> in wt are a subset of those with high cdc <dig> in pfh1-depleted cells.  to compare the overall cdc <dig> occupancy at g <dig> motifs in pfh1-expressing  and pfh1-depleted cells , we estimated the expected distribution of high cdc <dig> sites for  <dig>  control region sets matched to the observed g <dig> motifs . because the coverage of the genome by cdc <dig> is higher in pfh1-depleted cells, the expected g <dig> motif association is somewhat higher for pfh1-depleted cells  than pfh1-expressing cells . in pfh1-expressing cells the 50 g <dig> motifs with high cdc <dig> occupancy  was not different from the expected number . in pfh1-depleted cells, significantly more g <dig> motifs were associated with high cdc <dig> regions than expected .  cdc20-3ha peaks were validated in wt and pfh1-depleted cells by chip-qpcr using an anti-ha antibody as described for figure 1c. in pfh1-depleted cells, all g <dig> motifs and the trna gene had a significant increase of cdc <dig> levels compared to wt cells . chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation; g <dig>  g-quadruplex; qpcr, quantitative pcr; wt, wild type.



there were  <dig> high confidence cdc <dig> peaks in pfh1-depleted cells, modestly more than the number in wt cells. however, in contrast to wt cells, g <dig> motifs were highly enriched among the high cdc <dig> binding sites in pfh1-depleted cells . moreover, g <dig> motifs associated with pfh <dig> in wt cells were much more likely to show high cdc <dig> association in pfh1-depleted cells compared to g <dig> motifs not associated with pfh <dig> . for example, 43% of the pfh1-associated g <dig> motifs were also high cdc <dig> binding sites in pfh1-depleted cells. in contrast, only 11% of the g <dig> motifs not associated with pfh <dig> had high cdc <dig> binding in pfh1-depleted cells. this pattern was also true for g <dig> motifs and cdc <dig> peaks from pfh1-expressing cells . thus, while g <dig> motifs as a group were not significantly associated with high cdc <dig> in wt cells, those g <dig> motifs that had high pfh <dig> binding were also significantly associated with high cdc <dig> binding.table  <dig>

to validate the high cdc20-binding sites, we performed chip-qpcr in wt and pfh1-depleted cells with the same primer pairs used to confirm pfh <dig> association . at the trna gene, and all three g <dig> motifs, we found significantly higher cdc <dig> occupancy in pfh1-depleted cells compared to wt cells . cdc <dig> occupancy in wt cells and pfh1-depleted cells did not increase at the three gc-rich regions .

dna damage occurs near g <dig> motifs
phosphorylation of histone h2a is one of the earliest responses to a dsb. in s. pombe, h2a phosphorylation occurs in an area of approximately 25 kb on either side of a dsb, with the highest peaks around 5 kb from the break site  <cit> . to determine if fork pausing near g <dig> motifs resulted in dna damage, we performed chip-seq using antibodies that recognize phosphorylated h2a   <cit> . as in the cdc <dig> experiments, nmt-pfh1-gfp cells were grown with or without thiamine for 12 hours and then processed for chip-seq and chip-qpcr.

we identified  <dig> γ-h2a peaks in pfh1-expressing cells and  <dig> γ-h2a peaks in pfh1-depleted cells. these peaks were associated with  <dig> and 177 g <dig> motifs, respectively . even in the presence of pfh <dig>  g <dig> motifs were significantly enriched within 5 kb of γ-h2a peaks . this association was even stronger in pfh1-depleted cells, with 177 g <dig> motifs with high γ-h2a levels . thus, g <dig> motifs were near sites of dna damage in both pfh1-expressing and pfh1-depleted cells, but the number of damage-associated g <dig> motifs was much higher in the absence of pfh <dig> figure  <dig> 
g <dig> motifs are significantly associated with dna damage.  the venn diagram shows the overlaps between g <dig> motifs that were associated with high pfh <dig> , high γ-h2a in wt cells , and high γ-h2a in pfh1-depleted cells . nearly all g <dig> motifs with high γ-h2a in wt also had high γ-h2a in pfh1-depleted cells.  g <dig> motifs were significantly associated with high γ-h2a in both pfh1-expressing  and pfh1-depleted  cells. the significance of these associations was determined by comparison to the number of overlaps in  <dig>  random control sets in both pfh1-expressing  and pfh1-depleted cells . when pfh <dig> was depleted, there was a dramatic increase in the amount of dna damage at g <dig> motifs, as inferred from γ-h2a associations for pfh1-depleted  versus pfh1-expressing  cells. in both contexts, the association of g <dig> motifs with high γ-h2a was significant .  γ-h2a associated peaks were validated in wt and pfh1-depleted cells by chip-qpcr using an anti- γ-h2a antibody as described in figure 1c except that the primer pairs were located further from each test site  to detect regions with the highest γ-h2a content. by two-tailed student t-test, all g <dig> motifs and the trna gene had significantly increased γ-h2a in pfh1-depleted cells compared to wt cells . chip, chromatin immunoprecipitation; g <dig>  g-quadruplex; qpcr, quantitative pcr; wt, wild type.



as for cdc <dig> occupancy, we validated the γ-h2a peaks with chip-qpcr using anti-γ-h2a antibodies in wt and pfh1-depleted cells . both the trna gene and the three g <dig> motifs had significantly increased γ-h2a levels in pfh1-depleted cells compared to wt cells . we did not detect a significant increase for the three investigated gc-rich regions .

to determine if dna damage was more likely to occur at individual g <dig> sites in pfh1-depleted versus wt cells, we compared the p-values for the γ-h2a peaks at a given g <dig> motif in pfh1-expressing and pfh1-depleted cells. we used the same number of chip-seq reads from both contexts so that p-values from the two conditions could be compared. g <dig> motifs without an overlapping peak in a given context were assigned a p-value of  <dig>  the mean p-value decreased from  <dig>  in pfh1-expressing cells to 1e- <dig> in pfh1-depleted cells, and the peak p-values in pfh1-depleted cells were consistently more significant . these findings suggest that the probability of dna damage at a given g <dig> motif is higher in pfh1-depleted versus pfh1-expressing cells.

in the absence of pfh <dig>  g <dig> motifs associated with replication fork stalling are more likely to result in double strand breaks
to combine the observations on g <dig> motifs, pfh <dig> presence, replication fork slowing and dna damage in pfh1-depleted cells, we analyzed the association between high cdc <dig> occupancy and γ-h2a levels at g <dig> motifs in pfh1-expressing and pfh1-depleted cells. when pfh <dig> was expressed, g <dig> motifs with high cdc <dig> occupancy were no more or less likely to be near a site of dna damage, as marked by γ-h2a, than g <dig> motifs without cdc <dig> . however, when the same test was performed on data from pfh1-depleted cells, there was a highly significant association between high cdc <dig> occupancy at g <dig> motifs and nearby damage . these data suggest that in wt cells pfh <dig> prevents breakage of forks that pause at g <dig> sites.table  <dig>

features of g <dig> motifs that are pfh1- and dna damage-associated
in total,  <dig> of the 446 g <dig> motifs in the s. pombe genome were associated with pfh <dig>  fork pausing  and/or dna damage . based on their relationship with pfh <dig>  we defined three classes of g <dig> motifs. the first class contained 90 g <dig> motifs that were pfh <dig> associated in wt cells . the second class consisted of  <dig> pfh1-sensitive g <dig> motifs; that is, these motifs were sites of fork slowing and/or dna breakage only in pfh1-depleted cells . the third class consisted of 106 g <dig> motifs that were sites of fork slowing and/or dna damage in both wt and pfh1-depleted cells . by definition, there was no overlap between class ii and class iii, but class i motifs could also be in either class ii or iii.

nearly 40% of class i motifs were not sites of genome instability in either wt or pfh1-depleted cells. this finding suggests that these g <dig> motifs do not form g <dig> structures, at least during s phase, or that these motifs are resolved by a different helicase in pfh1-depleted cells. only eight  of the pfh1-sensitive  motifs were pfh1-associated  in wt cells, a surprising finding . in contrast, pfh <dig> was detected at 40% of class iii sites, but this binding was not sufficient to prevent damage in wt cells. however, pausing, as monitored by levels of cdc <dig> occupancy, was higher at 70% of these sites in pfh1-depleted cells compared to wt cells ; that is, the presence of pfh <dig> did facilitate replication at many class iii sites.

we explored genomic features associated with the three categories of g <dig> motifs to see if any attributes distinguished them from each other and those seen when all g <dig> motifs were considered together. the  <dig> class i g <dig> motifs lacked the associations seen when considering g <dig> motifs overall, except for being enriched at meiotic dsb hotspots. the only other significant association for this class was overrepresentation within the  <dig> most highly transcribed rna polymerase ii genes . remarkably, in almost all  of these cases, the g <dig> motif was on the transcribed strand of the highly transcribed gene. this strand bias was significantly stronger than the bias observed for g <dig> motifs overall . this enrichment was particularly striking given the significant depletion of g <dig> motifs in orfs when all g <dig> motifs were considered . genomic attributes for class ii and iii g <dig> motifs were similar to the patterns observed for g <dig> motifs overall .

discussion
although pif <dig> family helicases are found in almost all eukaryotes, virtually all in vivo evidence for their role at g <dig> motifs comes from budding yeast. to determine if the deleterious impact of unresolved g <dig> structures and the positive role of pif <dig> family helicases at these structures holds true in other organisms, we used an integrated computational and experimental approach in s. pombe, an organism that diverged from s. cerevisiae more than a billion years ago. these studies are particularly important because budding yeast is unusual in encoding two pif <dig> helicases, scpif <dig> and scrrm <dig>  while most eukaryotes encode only one . the two s. cerevisiae helicases, scpif <dig> and scrrm <dig>  have multiple, often conflicting, roles in genome integrity, so it is not clear how findings on scpif <dig> and scrrm <dig> translate to organisms with a single pif <dig> helicase. in addition, by multiple criteria, s. pombe chromosomes are more similar to mammalian chromosomes than s. cerevisiae chromosomes  <cit> . thus, the sole s. pombe pif <dig> family helicase, pfh <dig>  is a more apt model for the mammalian enzyme.

consistent patterns in the genomic distribution of g <dig> motifs across three diverse species
the genomic features associated with g <dig> motifs in s. pombe were strikingly similar to those seen in the s. cerevisiae and human nuclear genomes  <cit> , supporting the conservation of g <dig> motif biology across more than one billion years of evolution. in particular, three functional regions are g4-rich and a fourth is g4-poor in the three organisms. first, promoters of rna polymerase ii transcribed genes in s. pombe contained more g <dig> motifs than expected . likewise in budding yeast and humans, g <dig> motifs are enriched within 850 bp and 1 kb, respectively, of the transcriptional start site, suggesting a common regulatory function for g <dig> motifs  <cit> . this correlation also agrees with our finding that s. pombe g <dig> motifs were enriched in ndrs, regions that are found in the majority of promoters  <cit> . second, as in budding yeast and humans, the s. pombe rdna was enriched with g <dig> motifs  <cit> . in s. pombe and s. cerevisiae, they were only present on the non-transcribed strand  <cit> . the fact that the g <dig> motifs are over-represented in rdna in evolutionarily diverse organisms argues that this arrangement has functional importance. for example, formation of g <dig> structures in the non-transcribed strand could facilitate high transcription rates by sequestering the transcribed template to prevent re-annealing to the g4-rich complementary strand. third, telomeres in yeast, human and many other species contain g <dig> motifs. s. pombe telomeres are no exception; they have the highest density of g <dig> motifs of any region in the s. pombe genome:  <dig>  g <dig> motifs per kb, which is even higher than expected from the high gc content of telomeric dna. g <dig> structures form in vivo in a cell cycle dependent manner in ciliate and human telomeric dna  <cit> , and their presence is proposed to protect ends from nuclease degradation, and/or affect telomerase recruitment  <cit> . the fact that telomeres bear constitutive single-stranded g-tails makes them strong candidates for g <dig> formation, unless proteins or other structures  prevent their formation. the fourth conserved association of g <dig> motifs in all three organisms is their depletion from orfs   <cit> .

taken together, these common patterns in the genomic distribution of g <dig> motifs add to the increasing evidence that g <dig> structures have regulatory functions that are maintained by selection and that likely counterbalance their negative effects on genome stability  <cit> . however, in certain contexts, such as orfs, the price of their negative effects may be too steep, leading to selection against g <dig> motifs in these regions.

pfh <dig> suppresses g4-induced genomic instability in s. pombe
we provide multiple lines of evidence that support the importance of pfh <dig> in suppressing g4-induced genomic instability in s. pombe. first, 20% of g <dig> motifs had high pfh <dig> occupancy, consistent with the possibility that pfh <dig> acts at a subset of g <dig> motifs in vivo. this number is likely an underestimate. for example, only 9% of the class ii pfh1-sensitive sites had significant pfh <dig> binding; yet their dependence on pfh <dig> argues that all of these sites may bind pfh <dig>  we attribute the lack of detectable binding at most class ii sites to the speed with which pif <dig> family helicases unwind g <dig> structures  <cit> , the stringent criteria used to identify binding sites, and technical difficulties detecting dna helicases by chip  <cit> . in contrast to class ii sites, pfh <dig> was detected at 40% of class iii sites. this finding suggests that g <dig> structures persist longer at class iii than at class ii sites. for example, at class iii g <dig> motifs, g <dig> structures may reform after pfh <dig> action, leading to repeated cycles of pfh <dig> binding and unwinding at the site. this hypothesis could also explain why class iii g <dig> motifs were sites of replication fork slowing and/or dna damage even in wt cells. our data also likely underestimate the fraction of g <dig> motifs that form g <dig> structures: other helicases might act at other g <dig> motifs, while some g <dig> structures may form only outside of s phase or only in specific growth conditions. of course, some g <dig> motifs may rarely or never form g <dig> structures.

the second result supporting a role for pfh <dig> at g <dig> motifs is that replication pausing at g <dig> motifs, as monitored by high cdc <dig> occupancy, was much higher in pfh1-depleted than in wt cells . moreover, g <dig> motifs that were associated with pfh <dig> in wt cells were much more likely to be associated with replication fork pausing than those that were not bound by pfh <dig> . third, g <dig> motifs were significantly associated with dna damage, as indicated by the presence of γ-h2a. some g <dig> motifs were sites of damage even in the presence of pfh <dig>  but this association and γ-h2a levels were considerably stronger in its absence . moreover, when pfh <dig> was depleted, g <dig> motifs with replication fork pausing  were much more likely to result in dna damage than g <dig> motifs without pausing .

as in budding yeast and humans, g <dig> motifs in s. pombe were underrepresented within orfs . however, when s. pombe g <dig> motifs did occur in orfs, they were enriched on the transcribed strand . this enrichment was particularly marked for the pfh1-associated g <dig> motifs . furthermore, this enrichment was especially high among the top  <dig> most highly transcribed rna polymerase ii genes . although a recent report demonstrated that highly expressed genes may be biased for high chip-seq signals  <cit> , fork slowing in highly expressed s. pombe genes and its increase in pfh1-depleted cells, are detected by two-dimensional gels as well as by chip  <cit> . the g <dig> motifs in orfs tended to fall within the first half of the orf , but g <dig> motifs were observed near the ends of genes as well . a similar strand bias was seen when only considering g <dig> motifs that overlapped 5′ and 3′ utrs,  <dig> %  and 77% , respectively, were found on the transcribed strand. a g <dig> motif on the transcribed strand is expected to inhibit rna polymerase progression. one possibility is that this class of g <dig> motifs regulates transcription elongation: transcription could start but then pause at the g <dig> motif until the regulated recruitment of pfh <dig> allows g <dig> unwinding and resumption of transcription. this type of regulation is particularly appealing in multi-cellular organisms where developmentally regulated genes are often controlled by activation of a paused rna polymerase  <cit> . alternatively, pfh <dig> bound to g <dig> motifs within highly transcribed genes might facilitate rna removal and inhibit r-loop formation. this speculation is based on the unusual property of budding yeast pif <dig>  which has higher unwinding activity on rna/dna compared to dna/dna hybrids  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the evolutionary conservation of g <dig> motif enrichment in promoters, rdna and telomeres in two distantly related yeasts and humans argues that they have functions in each of these regions. their depletion from the protein-coding orfs in the three organisms, as well as their association with fork stalling and dna breakage in the two yeasts, demonstrates that their positive roles come with a negative impact on genome integrity. these negative effects are mitigated in both s. cerevisiae and s. pombe by the action of pif <dig> family helicases. we propose that processing of g <dig> structures by pif <dig> family helicases is a common and evolutionarily conserved mechanism.
