BACKGROUND
ischemic heart disease  is a major cause of death all over the world. reduction in the blood flow to myocardium leads to ihd and its restitution , spontaneously or by drug / surgery, is essential for tissue/organ survival. however, reperfusion itself exacerbates myocardial injury, commonly known as myocardial ischemic-reperfusion injury   <cit> . therefore, iri is considered as a common sequel of ihd. oxidative stress has been largely implicated in the etiopathogenesis of iri. oxidative stress occurs due to increased production of reactive oxygen species  like, superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical at the time of reperfusion, which overwhelms the endogenous antioxidant defense  <cit> . interaction of ros with cell membrane and various other cellular components have deleterious effects on cellular functions and viability. oxidative stress is evidenced by increased cellular accumulation of lipid peroxides and depletion of endogenous antioxidants  <cit> .

living organisms have developed antioxidant defense mechanisms against damage due to oxidative stress. these mechanisms in the heart have been extensively studied and the most active endogenous antioxidants involved in this process are superoxide dismutase , catalase , and glutathione peroxidase   <cit> . in addition to this, alpha-tocopherols or vit e, vitamin c and beta-carotene constitute important exogenous antioxidants present in diet  <cit> .

the physiological actions of diet continue to be the focus of interest because of its major role in ischemic heart disease. dietary antioxidants e.g., vitamin e, beta-carotene, vitamin c have beneficial effects in oxidative stress associated with various cardiovascular diseases, including ischemic heart disease  <cit> . therefore, dietary antioxidants have potential therapeutic role in the prevention and treatment of ischemic heart disease.

palm oil, obtained from the fruit of the tropical plant elaeis guineensis, is the second major edible oil used worldwide  <cit> . palm olein oil , a liquid fraction obtained from the refining of palm oil, is rich in oleic acid , beta-carotene and vitamin e . po is used as dietary oil in many parts of the world including india. in some previous studies, palm oil has been reported to have antioxidant effects in hypertension  <cit>  and arterial thrombosis  <cit>  in rats. in addition to this, palm oil has been shown to increase prostacyclin  and reduce thromboxane a <dig>  levels in tissues  <cit> . however scientific studies on antioxidant effects of palm olein oil on ischemic heart disease and ischemic-reperfusion injury are still lacking.

therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the effects of dietary palm olein oil on myocardial endogenous antioxidants and on oxidative stress associated with ischemic-reperfusion injury in isolated rat heart model.

discussion
in the present study, a significant increase in myocardial sod, catalase and gpx activity was observed in the lower dose of palm olein oil fed rats. however, their further augmentation was not observed in the higher dose, i.e., a dose dependent effect was not observed. the finding correlates with the previous studies in which an increase in response was not observed with the increase in the dose of supplemented vitamin e  <cit> . the possible reasons behind the lack of dose response relationship may be a decrease in intestinal absorption as a result of increase in dose  <cit>  and newly absorbed vitamin e in part replacing the alpha-tocopherol in circulating lipoproteins  <cit> .

augmentation of endogenous antioxidants  has been recognized as an important pharmacological property, present in natural as well as many synthetic compounds  <cit> . this constitutes a major mechanism of protection against oxidative stress, offered by them  <cit> . the most abundant reactive oxygen species generated in living system is superoxide radical which is acted upon by sod to produce hydrogen peroxide which in turn is inactivated by catalase and / or gpx into water and oxygen. thus an increase in both sod and catalase along with gpx activity is considered to be more beneficial in the event of oxidative stress  <cit> .

increase in myocardial tbars and depletion of myocardial endogenous antioxidants support the occurrence of oxidative stress in the control hearts following ischemia-reperfusion in the present study. it was also accompanied by tissue injury with marked edema and focal loss of myocardial fibres. similar changes have been reported earlier to occur following brief period of ischemia followed by reperfusion in rat heart  <cit> . hearts from palm olein oil fed rats in both doses were protected against oxidative stress, as evidenced by inhibition of increase in tbars, depletion of catalase, gpx and tissue injury following ischemia-reperfusion. in a previous study, palm oil has been reported to prevent oxidative stress induced hypertension in rats  <cit> . the mechanism of such protection can be attributed to the augmented endogenous antioxidant reserve of heart in the lower dose. however, the higher dose, which did not cause any significant augmentation of endogenous antioxidants, also inhibited depletion of antioxidants, rise in tbars and tissue injury. it is possible that direct antioxidant effects of palm olein oil may be attributable to the presence of alpha tocopherols and tocotrienols, which are known to protect against oxidative stress.

experimental as well as clinical studies with exogenous antioxidants supplementation have been shown to have protective effect in ischemic heart disease  <cit> . in this regard, the most commonly used exogenous antioxidants are vitamin e , beta-carotene and vitamin c. palm oil is also beneficial in conditions like hypertension  <cit> , arterial thrombosis  <cit>  and causes increase in pgi <dig> /txa <dig> ratio  <cit> . palm oil derived vitamin e rich in tocotrienols has shown beneficial effects against hypercholesterolemia  <cit>  and is considered to be more potent than tocopherols  <cit> .

the observations made in the present study have important nutritional significance for palm olein oil in relation to ischemic heart disease. however, further studies are required to establish the mechanism, underlying the augmentation of tissue antioxidants.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study, for the first time, demonstrated that long term oral supplementation of palm olein oil caused augmentation of endogenous antioxidants of heart, which were subsequently protected from developing oxidative stress following ischemia-reperfusion.
