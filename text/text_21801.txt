BACKGROUND
staphylococcal enterotoxins  are extracellular proteins, produced mainly by staphylococcus aureus, causing food intoxication when ingested. staphylococcal food poisoning  was the fourth most common causative agent in food-borne illness within the eu in  <dig>  <cit> . it is associated with food, generally rich in protein, which requires extensive manual handling, often in combination with inadequate heating and/or inappropriate storage of the food  <cit> . to date,  <dig> staphylococcal enterotoxins or enterotoxin-like proteins , excluding variants, have been identified. these se genes are widely disseminated by several mobile genetic elements leading to variations in the se expression behavior among enterotoxigenic staphylococci  <cit> . the expression of a number of the enterotoxins including seb, sec, and sed is to some extent known to involve regulatory systems such as the accessory gene regulator , the staphylococcal accessory regulator  and the repressor of toxin   <cit> . however, we still have limited information about sea, the toxin considered to be mainly responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks  <cit> . the sea gene is carried in the bacterial genome by a polymorphic family of temperate bacteriophages  <cit> . recent studies of s. aureus strain mssa <dig> have shown that mitomycin c  induction of Φsa3ms, resulted in increased transcription of enterotoxins sea, seg, and sek and the fibrinolytic enzyme staphylokinase  carried by the prophage  <cit> . although, it is still unclear if the increased transcription of these virulence determinants lead to increased amounts of se proteins. furthermore, identification of the environmental parameters that control the expression of sea in food, and the mechanism by which these signals are transduced to bring about changes in gene expression, are very limited. this knowledge is crucial for understanding the potential of s. aureus to cause food poisoning.

acetic acid is a weak organic acid often used in the food industry as a preservative due to its antagonistic effect on bacterial pathogens  <cit> . weak acids have the ability to pass through the cell membrane in the undissociated form. once inside the cell, the acid dissociates in the more alkaline interior, lowering the intracellular ph of the cell. a decrease in intracellular ph can lead to the damage of macromolecules  and the cell membrane, and have a negative effect on cell maintenance  <cit> . also, the anion of the acid is accumulated intracellularly, increasing turgor pressure  <cit> . acetic acid has been found to be more inhibitory to the growth of s. aureus than lactic acid, citric acid, phosphoric acid and hydrochloric acid, respectively  <cit> . also, acetic acid has been found to almost completely inhibit sea formation in brain heart infusion  broth when added gradually over time  <cit> .

in the present study, the effects of acetic acid on s. aureus growth, sea expression and sea production were investigated in four growth phases. furthermore, the relationship between sea production and the lifecycle of the phage carrying the toxin gene was determined. finally, genomic analysis of s. aureus strains carrying sea was performed to map differences within the gene and in the temperate phage carrying sea.

RESULTS
effects of acetic acid on sea expression and sea production in s. aureus mu50
batch cultures of s. aureus mu <dig>  harboring the sea-containing Φ42-like prophage Φmu50a  <cit> , were carried out at controlled ph levels of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  . acetic acid was used to set the ph to investigate the effects of acetic acid on growth, relative sea expression and extracellular sea levels during all stages of growth. the maximal growth rate of s. aureus mu <dig> was highest at ph  <dig>  and decreased with decreasing ph . batch cultivations performed at lower ph values showed that ph  <dig>  was highly growth-inhibitory, with only a modest increase in optical density, od, and viable cells in the late stationary growth phase, and that ph  <dig>  was too toxic; < 1% of the starting inoculum was viable after  <dig> h. the relative sea expression pattern was similar at all tested ph levels that allowed expression analysis ; the highest relative levels of sea mrna were found in the transitional phase and fell during the stationary growth phase. small increases in sea expression were found in the transitional phase at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . however, relative sea expression in the transitional phase at ph  <dig>   and  <dig>   were high, nine and four times higher, respectively, than in the exponential growth phase. at ph  <dig> , extended sea mrna expression was observed with the peak associated with the transitional phase. however, sea mrna was not possible to detect at ph  <dig>  or  <dig> .

extracellular sea was detected in all cultivations of s. aureus mu <dig> and the levels increased over time at tested ph levels allowing growth . the sea levels increased from ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  and decreased significantly at lower ph levels, i.e. ph  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . the specific extracellular sea concentrations  correlating the sea production to growth, showed the same trend. the specific sea concentrations were  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ng per ml and od unit for ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively. the specific sea concentration at ph  <dig>  is misleading since the culture was not growing.

phage-associated sea expression
samples of bacterial cells and culture supernatants from s. aureus mu <dig> were collected to determine the trends of the relative sea gene copy number  and relative phage copy number in the four growth phases at different ph values . the relative sea gene copy number was low throughout the cultivations at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> . the sea gene copy number peaked at ph  <dig> , being twelve times higher than at ph  <dig>  in the mid-exponential growth phase, and a trend of the sea gene copy number decreasing over time was observed at this ph. the sea gene copy number increased over time at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , showing markedly higher levels at the last sampling point. the phage copy number increased over time at all ph levels, with a peak at ph  <dig> . in the late stationary growth phase, the phage copy number was  <dig> times higher at ph  <dig>  than at ph  <dig> .

to investigate if the extracellular sea levels were affected by prophage induction,  <dig>  μg/ml or  <dig>  μg/ml mc was added to exponentially growing s. aureus strains mu <dig>  sa <dig>  and sa <dig> . the number of viable cells of strain mu <dig> after three hours of growth following mc addition was reduced by two log units in cultures containing  <dig>  μg/ml mc and five log units in cultures containing  <dig>  μg/ml mc, compared with control cultures containing no mc. for both strains sa <dig> and sa <dig> the viable cell counts were reduced by one and four log units in cultures containing  <dig>  μg/ml and  <dig>  μg/ml mc, respectively . the specific extracellular sea levels, i.e. the extracellular sea concentration per colony-forming unit, cfu, of s. aureus strains mu <dig>  sa <dig>  and sa <dig>  increased with mc concentration compared to the control cultures, being ten,  <dig>  and  <dig> times higher at  <dig>  μg/ml mc, and  <dig>   <dig>  <dig>  and  <dig> times higher at  <dig>  μg/ml mc for mu <dig>  sa <dig>  and sa <dig>  respectively. viable phage particles, defined as plaque forming units, were observed for strains sa <dig> and sa <dig> after mc treatment but not for mu <dig> using s. aureus rn <dig> as recipient strain  .

effects of acetic acid on sea expression and sea production in s. aureus sa45
to determine if the response to acetic acid was specific to strain mu <dig> or a more general s. aureus response, a strain isolated from ham involved in a food poisoning outbreak, s. aureus sa <dig>  was used to replicate the batch cultivations at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  . s. aureus sa <dig> had higher maximal growth rate than s. aureus mu <dig>  but the cultures never reached the same maximum od as mu <dig>  the relative sea expression pattern of s. aureus sa <dig> was the same as for s. aureus mu <dig>  with the highest relative sea levels found in the transitional phase. the sea mrna levels and extracellular sea amounts were very similar for both strains at ph  <dig> . however, at ph  <dig>  the relative sea expression in the transitional phase was 38% higher in s. aureus mu <dig> compared to in s. aureus sa <dig> and the final extracellular sea concentration in the s. aureus mu <dig> cultures was 61% higher than in s. aureus sa <dig> cultures on average.

genetic diversity of sea
nucleotide sequence analysis of sea and prophage regions immediately upstream and downstream of the gene was performed on the whole-genome sequenced s. aureus strains mrsa <dig>  <cit> , mssa <dig>  <cit> , mu <dig>  mu <dig>  <cit> , mw <dig>  <cit> , and newman  <cit>  to determine genetic differences that may explain the different sea expression and sea production profiles observed at ph  <dig>  with s. aureus mu <dig> and sa <dig>  sequence alignment of the coding region of sea revealed two main groups of sea-carrying phages. within a group the sea sequences showed 100% sequence similarity and between the two groups the sequence similarity was 98%. prophages Φmu <dig>  Φmu50a, Φsa3ms, and Φsa3mw clustered together in a sea-group designated sea <dig>  while Φ252b and Φnm <dig> formed a sea group, designated sea <dig> 

all six phages shared a homologous region of  <dig>  kb downstream of the sea gene containing the sak gene. thereafter, the nucleotide sequences diverged, forming three subgroups of sea phages. the same grouping of phages was observed immediately upstream of the translational start site of sea . an analogous phage grouping was recently reported when comparing the integrase  nucleotide sequences of these bacteriophages  <cit> . to improve the resolution of phylogenetic analysis of these bacteriophages based on int genes, we repeated the int gene grouping . the Φmu3a/Φmu50a branch was found to be closer to the Φ252b/Φnm <dig> branch than to the Φsa3ms/Φsa3mw branch. this is in direct contrast to what was found for the sea gene.

in order to identify the phage- and sea-group of sa <dig>  eight different regions were targeted by pcr . this analysis showed that sa <dig> carries the sea1-version of the sea gene and belongs to the same subgroup as Φsa3mw.

 amplification occurred in pcr using the primer pair and genomic dna from the s. aureus strain listed.  no pcr amplification was observed.

discussion
the genetic diversity analysis of the prophage region encoding sea showed two main groups of genes, sea <dig> and sea <dig>  to our knowledge this has not been observed before. furthermore, figure  <dig> shows that the sea <dig> and sea <dig> genes are associated with specific bacteriophages which could be further grouped based on sequence similarities within regions upstream and downstream of the sea gene. borst and betley divided enterotoxin-a-producing s. aureus into high-sea producing and low-sea producing strains  <cit> . the variation in sea production was associated with differences in the prophage region immediately upstream of sea. the six strains analyzed here could be divided in three groups based on sequence differences in the sea-virulence region. however, a different grouping than for the sea gene was observed upon comparing the int gene of these phages. the int gene, being part of the core genome, is essential for the phage's lifecycle unlike the sea gene, and is therefore reflecting the evolutionary relationship among these phages. nucleotide sequence analysis of s. aureus mu <dig> and sa <dig> showed that they belong to different groups based on variations in the nucleotide sequences within the sea-virulence region. this division may explain the differences observed between the two strains regarding sea expression and sea levels at ph  <dig> .

the sea expression was highest in the transition from the exponential to the stationary growth phase in both s. aureus mu <dig> and sa <dig> at all ph levels that allowed expression analysis, as established previously  <cit> . a boost in sea expression was observed in the transitional phase in s. aureus mu <dig> at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , which was also found in strain sa <dig>  the same expression pattern has been found for the prophage-encoded panton-valentine leukocidin  of s. aureus  <cit> . maximal expression of luk-pv in the late exponential growth phase was followed by a rapid decline post-exponentially. our observation could partially be explained by the induction of the prophage carrying the toxin gene. the sea-phage copy numbers of s. aureus mu <dig> at ph  <dig>  remained constant during the first part of cultivation. in the late stationary growth phase, however, the number had increased four times  compared to levels in early stationary growth phase. the phage copy numbers might have increased further if growth was allowed to continue. an acetic-acid induced intracellular drop in ph, leading to oxidative stress  <cit>  would activate the sos response system inducing the prophage  <cit> . sumby and waldor showed that upon prophage induction in s. aureus, the phage dna was replicated, resulting in an increase in sea gene copy number, and that a second prophage-regulated sea promoter was also activated, resulting in increased sea expression  <cit> . similar enhanced transcription of phage-encoded virulence genes upon prophage induction has also been observed for pvl in s. aureus and the shiga toxins in e. coli  <cit> .

mitomycin c, a well-known prophage inducer, was used in this study. the more mc added, the more sea was produced per cfu for all three strains tested, supporting the association between prophage induction and sea production. however, the expected boost in extracellular sea levels accompanying the increased sea mrna levels and sea gene copy levels observed at ph  <dig>  was not found. this could be because of the pronounced phage production at ph  <dig>  seen as a rapid increase in extracellular sea-phage copy number . the window for phage-encoded sea-biosynthesis prior to phage-release could be too narrow in the bacteria at this ph level. the relative phage copy number generally increased over time at all ph levels investigated. at ph  <dig> , the relative phage copy number was increasing dramatically over time, suggesting that substantial prophage induction had occurred. the sea gene copy number, however, was decreasing over time at ph  <dig> . this could be due to cell lysis occurring upon prophage induction at this ph. at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , a big increase in relative sea gene copy number was observed between the two last sampling points. this suggests that the prophage has been induced and the replicative form of the phage dna is produced. however, at these low ph values, no great increase in sea or phage copies were observed, suggesting protein synthesis was impaired.

in addition, the reason why the sea expression of s. aureus mu <dig> at ph  <dig>  was not as high as at ph  <dig> , despite the fact that an even higher level of acetic acid was added, could also be because the acetic acid concentration here was on the limit of that tolerated by the organism. the growth rate of the culture at ph  <dig>  was almost half of that at ph  <dig> . the expression pattern at ph  <dig>  was different from the patterns at the higher ph levels studied, in that it lacked the sharp expression peak in the transitional phase. at ph levels below  <dig> , low amounts of sea were produced. this supports the theory that ph  <dig>  is close to the limiting ph of the bacterium. the sea levels remained constant at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  during the cultivation of mu <dig>  with a final sea concentration of  <dig> ng/ml for both ph levels, indicating that no sea production occured ≤ ph  <dig> . this observation is supported by barber and deibel  <cit> . using hydrochloric acid, they found that the lowest ph values that supported sea biosynthesis in buffered bhi medium incubated aerobically was  <dig> . sfp can be caused by as little as 20- <dig> ng of enterotoxin  <cit> . levels higher than  <dig> ng/ml were detected at ph levels  <dig> - <dig>  in the mid-exponential growth phase.

CONCLUSIONS
this study has shown that the food preservative acetic acid increases sea gene expression in s. aureus. at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , maximal sea expression was observed. at ph  <dig>  there was a marked shift in growth rate and phage production peaked at ph  <dig> . these findings suggest prophage induction. at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , the sea gene copy numbers increased dramatically during late stages of cultivation, but sea levels and phage copy numbers were low indicating that protein synthesis was affected. it is our hypothesis that the acetic acid lowers the intracellular ph of s. aureus, activating the temperate phage and, as a consequence, boosts the sea expression. our results support the theory proposed by other research groups that prophages not only facilitate the dissemination of virulence genes, but also take part in the regulation of the expression of the genes.
