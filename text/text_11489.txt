BACKGROUND
the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae includes a cluster of closely related ruminant viruses with bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  as prototype  <cit> . bohv- <dig>  a major cattle pathogen, is typically responsible of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis  causing severe economic losses in livestock  <cit> . since its isolation, several conventional vaccines have been developed. these vaccines usually prevented clinical signs and reduced the amount of excreted viruses. however, there was still a need for improvements in order to use them in control and/or eradication programmes  <cit> . therefore, bohv- <dig> marker vaccines comprising attenuated or killed mutants with a deletion in one of the non-essential genes  were developed and eradication campaigns were initiated in many european countries. they have proven their safety and efficacy in the target bovine species since they are efficacious at reducing disease severity, virus shedding, and circulation in a population  <cit> .

caprine herpesvirus  <dig>  is associated with two different syndromes in goats, a lethal systemic disease in kids  <cit>  and a genital disease leading to balanoposthitis  <cit> , vulvovaginitis  <cit>  and abortion  <cit>  in adults. these clinical signs and the virus presence in nasal, ocular, rectal and vaginal samples suggest both the venereal transmission as the principal virus entry route and infection persistence within herds  <cit> . the genital tropism of cphv- <dig> was confirmed by the detection of viral dna in sacral ganglia of latently infected goats  <cit> . according to serological investigations, the infection occurs worldwide with highest prevalences observed in mediterranean countries  <cit> . however, the economical losses due to cphv- <dig> infection are probably underestimated. to date, a classical inactivated vaccine has been developed  <cit> , however, it can not be licensed since the market of veterinary medicinal products for minor species, like goats, is not economically profitable. consequently, the control of this infection still relies on hygienic prophylactic measures  <cit> .

bohv- <dig> and cphv- <dig> are antigenically and genetically closely related  <cit> . this relationship was originally demonstrated by serological assays  <cit>  and lately by phylogenetic analysis  <cit> . these viruses are able to some extent to cross the species barrier and establish infection in heterologous animal species  <cit> . experimental reactivation of latent infection of bohv- <dig> in goats was successfully performed  <cit> . moreover, a recent experiment showed that intranasal administration of a live attenuated ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine in goats reduced the peak viral titre after a nasal cphv- <dig> challenge and therefore afforded a partial cross-protection  <cit> .

in the following study, it is hypothesised that an intranasal administration  could afford a protection against the clinical genital infection. indeed, for many years, the upper respiratory mucosa has been proven to be suitable for vaccine delivery. the recent advances in the study of the mucosal immune system strengthen this mode of administration as being a very effective route for vaccination for both peripheral and mucosal immunity  <cit> . in human, nasal mucosa can serve as an efficient site for the induction of specific iga and igg responses in vaginal secretions  <cit> . the goat genital tract might employ similar homing mechanisms as those of the upper respiratory tract and therefore could receive primed immune cells from the nasopharynx-associated lymphoid tissue   <cit> . therefore, it was decided to investigate ge-negative bohv- <dig> intranasal route of vaccination in goats with the aim to protect this species against cphv- <dig> genital infection.

RESULTS
clinical and viral responses after intranasal immunisation
goats immunised by intranasal inoculation with virulent cphv- <dig> or ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine remained in good general state of health. no signs of severe disease as anorexia, depression, oedema or lesions were observed. the ge-negative bohv- <dig> immunisation did not induce any undesirable local or systemic reaction and goats did not show any clinical sign of disease. on the opposite, goats inoculated with cphv- <dig> expressed mild clinical signs as hyperemia and nasal discharge. based on the mean rectal temperature, the statistical analysis revealed significant differences between groups . from day  <dig> after immunisation, the mean temperatures of cphv- <dig> inoculated goats were higher than the temperature of ge-negative bohv- <dig> immunised goats  .

following the first immunisation , only cphv- <dig> was excreted by goats . cphv- <dig> was isolated in cell culture and was detected by pcr in nasal swabs but was not recovered from vaginal swabs and buffy coats. the peak viral titre was  <dig>  tcid <dig> per  <dig> μl of nasal secretions. after the second immunisation , both samples from ge-negative bohv- <dig> and from cphv- <dig> infected goats were consistently negative by isolation in cell culture and detection by pcr.

viral excretion after cphv- <dig> intravaginal challenge
three weeks after the second immunisation, control and immunised goats were intravaginally challenged with the virulent cphv- <dig> ba- <dig> strain . the mean cphv- <dig> titres in vaginal swabs were significantly different  between groups immunised with either ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine or virulent cphv- <dig> and the non-immunised group. the lowest excretion titres were obtained in the cphv- <dig> immunised group compared to ge-negative bohv- <dig> immunised or non-immunised groups . the immunisation with ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine decreased the mean challenge virus excretion titres:  <dig>  log on day  <dig>   <dig>  log on day  <dig>   <dig>  log on day  <dig>   <dig>  log on day  <dig>   <dig>  on day  <dig>  except on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> after challenge where the mean excretion titres, although not significantly different, were lower than the mean excretion titres obtained on the same day in non-immunised goats. furthermore, the ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine shortened the challenge strain shedding. while no viral shedding was detected on day  <dig> in non-immunised group, goats from the ge-negative bohv- <dig> immunised group excreted the challenge cphv- <dig> during a significantly shorter time period. the shortest virus shedding, up to day  <dig> after challenge, was detected in the cphv- <dig> immunised group .

on days  <dig> and  <dig> after challenge, viruses from one goat in each group were further propagated individually and characterised using restriction enzyme analysis. the bsteii profiles confirmed that viruses excreted after challenge by goats immunised with ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine were cphv- <dig> challenge ba- <dig> strain .

clinical protection against cphv- <dig> intravaginal challenge
groups intranasally immunised with either virulent cphv- <dig> or ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccines were protected against the clinical form of the genital cphv- <dig> infection . consequently, the clinical score of each group was significantly lower  than in the non-immunised group. the statistical analysis revealed no significant difference between the ge-negative bohv- <dig> immunised and the cphv- <dig> immunised groups  except at days  <dig> and  <dig> after challenge. at these days, goats immunised with ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine showed mild oedema or vulva hyperemia.

the mean rectal temperature of immunised groups was significantly lower  than those of the non-immunised group except at the challenge peak . additionally, the group immunised by inoculation with virulent cphv- <dig> exhibited a significant lower temperature  than the ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine immunised group. overall, goats did not show any sign of hyperthermia .

immune responses after immunisation and challenge
in goats immunised with either virulent cphv- <dig> or ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine, cphv- <dig> neutralising antibodies were observed from day  <dig> after the first immunisation . no significant difference between groups was noticed. after the second immunisation, a sharp increase in cphv- <dig> neutralising antibody titres was observed in the cphv- <dig> immunised group. in contrast, goats immunised with ge-negative bohv- <dig> did not show any boost of the primary immune response . following the cphv- <dig> intravaginal challenge, the mean cphv- <dig> neutralising antibody titres were significantly different  between groups immunised with ge-negative bohv- <dig> or cphv- <dig> and the non-immunised group. interestingly, goats immunised with ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine showed an increase in cphv- <dig> neutralising antibodies, but their neutralising titres were much lower than that of cphv- <dig> immunised goats . neutralising antibody titres were lower against bohv- <dig> than cphv- <dig> in all groups . moreover, all animals remained negative with the bohv- <dig> ge blocking elisa.

discussion
taking advantage of the susceptibility of goats to bohv- <dig>  <cit> , the efficacy of a live attenuated ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine was assessed in goats after two intranasal administrations followed by a subsequent cphv- <dig> intravaginal challenge. the intranasal use of a ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine enabled a cross-protection against cphv- <dig> genital infection which is the natural route of infection in goats. as observed in human, nasal mucosa can serve as an efficient site for the induction of a specific protective response in the genital tract. it could be a consequence of the induction of specific iga and igg responses in vaginal secretions. the presence of specific antibody secreting cells  in the genital tract have been demonstrated after nasal vaccination in mice  <cit> . in another study, it has been shown that t lymphocyte homing to the genital mucosa requires the interaction of integrins αlβ <dig> and α4β <dig> with endothelial intercellular adhesion molecule- <dig> and vascular cell adhesion molecule- <dig> , respectively  <cit> . since both nasal and genital mucosa express vcam- <dig>  this adressin could be involved in the homing of specific ascs to the genital tract. moreover, chemokine like cc chemokine ligand  <dig>  which is expressed in both tissues, could interact with the chemokine receptor  <dig> expressed on nasal ascs and be involved too in the homing of specific ascs to the genital area  <cit> . although the underlying mechanism was not investigated in this study, it can be speculated that such pathways could be involved in the current protection.

following the first immunisation, the safety of the ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine in goats was evidenced by the absence of side effects and local or systemic reactions. interestingly, goats did not excrete ge-negative bohv- <dig> although a low level of bohv- <dig> excretion was observed previously  <cit> . a weaker replication of ge-negative bohv- <dig> could account for this result. nevertheless, the presence of neutralising antibodies against bohv- <dig> after the first and second immunisations suggests the replication of ge-negative bohv- <dig> in goats. it can be hypothesised that the first immunisation induced a strong mucosal immunity leading to the neutralisation of newly replicated viruses after the second immunisation. the absence of detection of anti-ge antibodies in bohv- <dig> ge blocking elisa is consistent with the deletion of the gene encoding ge in the bohv- <dig> vaccine. moreover, such negative results in goats inoculated with cphv- <dig> suggest a difference in the antigenicity of ge between bohv- <dig> and cphv- <dig> 

another issue to consider is the possible establishment of ge-negative bohv- <dig> in a latent state in vaccinated goats. indeed, bohv- <dig> is able to establish latency in goats but with a poor reactivation success rate  <cit> . however, ge-negative bohv- <dig> is less effective in reactivation and reexcretion than wild type viruses in calves  <cit> . therefore, the risk of reactivation and reexcretion of a ge-negative bohv- <dig> in goats is low. on the other hand, the vaccination could also lead to the emergence of new recombinant viruses. indeed, despite the fact that in the subfamily alphaherpesvirinae, viruses of different species show very few sequence similarities to allow homologous recombination, several interspecific recombinants were isolated in vitro  <cit> . natural recombinants between equid herpesviruses  <dig> and  <dig> were, for example, recently identified  <cit> . therefore, the question of recombinants rising from cross-infection of cphv- <dig> infected goats with bohv- <dig> needs to be considered. among the cluster of ruminant alphaherpesviruses related to bohv- <dig>  only two recombinant viruses between bohv- <dig> and bohv- <dig> were isolated, and no recombinant between bohv- <dig> and less closely related cphv- <dig> and cvhv- <dig> was detected in vitro  <cit> . consequently, in regards of these data and especially the low level of excretion, the vaccination described here is likely to be completely safe.

the reduction of the clinical score was considered as the most relevant parameter showing the efficacy of nasal immunisation against cphv- <dig>  goats immunised intranasally with ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine were clinically protected. moreover, the difference between goats immunised with either ge-negative bohv- <dig> or cphv- <dig> was not statistically significant. the ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine was not only effective in preventing development of genital disease upon challenge, but also in significantly reducing the magnitude and the duration of challenge cphv- <dig> excretion. a high protection against clinical signs was also observed after immunisation by intranasal infection with cphv- <dig>  however, in natural conditions, the same kind of protection is not likely to be reached because the main route of transmission is venereal instead of respiratory  <cit> . the current cphv- <dig> vaginal challenge used in this assay was even more severe than in previous experiments  <cit>  and this result brings a reliable validation of the current study. the significant differences observed between immunised and non-immunised groups have been obtained with a relatively low number of animals, therefore despite a lower power of the statistical test. these data allowed the identification of a significant effect of vaccination with the live attenuated ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine  <cit> . moreover, nasal vaccination is an interesting alternative for inducing specific antibody responses in female genital tract, both for convenience and because the outcome of vaginal vaccination might be dependent on the time point in the oestral cycle for vaccine administration  <cit> .

concerning infection control, such vaccination could bring several advantages. indeed, the existence of antigenic cross-reactions between ruminant alphaherpesviruses related to bohv- <dig> and their ability to cross the species barrier raise theoretical problems for the differential diagnosis and the detection of any other virus reservoir, both in regions and countries where bohv- <dig> infection has been eradicated and in those where the control of ibr is currently or will be undertaken  <cit> . the use of such vaccination could reduce the circulation of cphv- <dig> in goats which would be therefore less involved in bohv- <dig> misdiagnosis due to infection with a closely related alphaherpesvirus. moreover, the development of new vaccines in order to protect minor species against infection causing economical and management problems meets a poor interest from the pharmaceutical industry. in this context, a classical inactivated vaccine inducing a good protection against cphv- <dig> infection in goats was developed but was not licensed  <cit> . consequently, it was required to investigate the capacity of an already licensed bovine vaccine to induce a cross-protection against a related virus infection in goats according to the principle of the cascade. the european union has recently pointed out the requirements of medicinal veterinary products for minor uses and minor species, as goats for example  <cit> . the results obtained in this study clearly show that a bovine vaccine can be safely and efficiently used in goats.

CONCLUSIONS
regarding the issue of ruminant alphaherpesvirus diagnosis, the economical constraints of the veterinary pharmaceutical industry and the well-being of animals, this study brings an expected tool for the cphv- <dig> induced disease prevention. indeed, the intranasal administration of a live attenuated ge-negative bohv- <dig> vaccine protects goats clinically and virologically against cphv- <dig> genital infection which is the natural route of infection in goats. in addition, the current study emphasises the interest of studying intranasal vaccination approaches against genitally transmitted infections through the mucosal immune system.
