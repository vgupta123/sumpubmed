BACKGROUND
genome-wide association studies  have proved powerful in unravelling the genetic component of several common diseases and complex traits, although increasing evidences  <cit>  suggest that rare variants, which are typically not analysed in gwass, also contribute a considerable proportion of disease risk. through gwass and meta-analyses, a large number of single nucleotide polymorphisms  have been associated with distinct autoimmune conditions including crohn's disease , ulcerative colitis , multiple sclerosis , type  <dig> diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , autoimmune thyroid disease , and ankylosing spondylitis . a general concept emerging from these studies is that a portion of susceptibility alleles is shared among two or more diseases, suggesting that common molecular mechanisms and pathways are involved. this may come as no surprise given the observation whereby clustering of distinct autoimmune diseases occurs within families . however, recent evidences have also indicated that a subset of alleles displays an opposite risk profile in different autoimmune conditions with one allele predisposing to one disease while being protective for another  <cit> . the first described example concerns a nonsynonymous variant  in ptpn <dig> : the 602w allele protects from cd but predisposes to ra, sle , t1d , and vitiligo  <cit> . similar observations have recently been extended to several snps  <cit> , mostly located within the extended major histocompatibility complex  region .

besides opening interesting questions as to how immune balances are maintained and modulated, these data stimulate speculations on the evolutionary forces and selective pressures shaping the frequency of these alleles in human populations.

in general, variants associated with complex traits contribute little to the overall disease risk and are therefore thought to be subjected to mild purifying selection  <cit> . yet, a portion of risk alleles may be regarded as deleterious, albeit mildly, from a medical standpoint but evolutionary neutral or even beneficial. evolutionary studies of the mhc region have mainly focused on hla class i and ii genes, that are known to be characterized by extreme polymorphism levels maintained by natural selection . conversely, the evolutionary history of non-hla genes has rarely been investigated.

here we aimed at testing the hypothesis  <cit>  whereby alleles with opposite risk profiles for autoimmune diseases have been maintained by balancing selection, possibly due to antagonistic pleiotropy, and to describe the evolutionary pattern of several non-hla genes located in the human xmhc. our data indicate that long-standing balancing selection has characterized the evolutionary history of non-hla genes located in the xmhc but only a minority of alleles with opposite risk profile can be regarded as targets of natural selection in human populations.

RESULTS
identification of alleles with opposite risk profile and selection of candidate genomic regions
two recent studies  <cit>  have identified several alleles with opposite risk profiles for autoimmune diseases . in order to search for additional instances, we analysed published gwas http://www.genome.gov/ <dig> and, in addition to the aforementioned variant in ptpn <dig>  we identified rs <dig> in stat <dig> and rs <dig> in il23r . the aim of our study is analysing the selective processes acting on variants with an opposite effect on two or more diseases and testing the hypothesis whereby balancing selection has shaped the frequency of a portion of these alleles. balancing selection is a process that maintains genetic variability in human populations and its signatures, due to recombination and mutation, are expected to extend over relatively short genomic regions . since variants identified in association studies often represent genetic markers rather than causal polymorphisms, we analysed the snps reported in table  <dig> and their surrounding genomic regions for the presence of putative functional polymorphisms that may represent the causal variant and, possibly, the selection target. details on functional annotation are reported in table  <dig> as well as in figure  <dig> . variants located in intergenic or relatively large intronic regions were not analysed due to the difficult inference of functional significance. also, the polymorphism located in mica was excluded as nucleotide diversity at this locus has been extensively investigated, although a clear picture of the selective or non-selective forces responsible for the presence of multiple alleles is still missing  <cit> . in the case of tap <dig>  the analysed region was extended so as to include a region that undergoes haplotype-specific alternative splicing  <cit> . snps located in close physical proximity were analysed as a single region: this was the case for rs <dig> and rs <dig> , rs <dig> and rs <dig> , and rs <dig> and rs <dig> .

c diseases are shown in order depending on the predisposing/protective effect of the minor allele.

as for rs <dig>  located downstream il18rap, the snp was not considered as the gene has previously been shown to be subjected to balancing selection  <cit> . finally, rs <dig>  lies in a region resequenced by the seattlesnps program and data were therefore retrieved from their website. a signature of balancing selection at the promoter region of il <dig> had previously been described  <cit> . resequencing data for stat <dig> are also publicly available  but the opposite-risk snp was not analysed as it is located within a resequencing gap in the long intron  <dig> 

nucleotide diversity and neutrality tests
as reported in table  <dig>  at least  <dig> kb encompassing each selected snp  were resequenced in  <dig> hapmap subjects with european ancestry , as most gwass for autoimmune diseases have been performed in european cohorts. the number of segregating sites identified in each region is reported in table  <dig>

b sampled population ;

c number of segregating sites;

d watterson's theta estimation per site ;

e nucleotide diversity per site ;

f percentile rank relative to a distribution of  <dig> 5kb segments from niehs genes;

g p value applying demographic coalescent simulations.

common population genetic tests based on the site frequency spectrum  include tajima's d   <cit>  and fu and li's d* and f*  <cit> . dt tests the departure from neutrality by comparing two nucleotide diversity indexes: θw  <cit> , an estimate of the expected per site heterozigosity, and π  <cit> , the average number of pairwise sequence nucleotide differences. positive values of dt indicate an excess of intermediate frequency variants and are a signature of balancing selection. fu and li's f* and d* are also based on snp frequency spectra and differ from dt in that they also take into account whether mutations occur in external or internal branches of a genealogy  <cit> . as an empirical comparison, θw, π, as well as dt, f* and d* were calculated for  <dig> kb windows  deriving from  <dig> genes resequenced by the niehs program in ceu. additionally, the statistical significance of neutrality tests was evaluated by performing coalescent simulations with a population genetic model that incorporates demographic scenarios  <cit> .

as shown in table  <dig>  no exceptional nucleotide diversity was observed for zscan <dig>  hla-dmb, vars <dig>  ptpn <dig>  bat <dig>  c6orf <dig>  and il <dig>  in line with this observation, summary statistics were consistent with evolutionary neutrality for these gene regions . conversely, the regions we analysed in cdsn/psors1c <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  btnl <dig> and tap <dig> showed extremely high nucleotide diversity, with both θw and π ranking above the 95th percentile in the distribution of 5kb reference windows.

for tap <dig>  cdsn/psors1c <dig>  and trim10/trim <dig> all tests rejected the null hypothesis of selective neutrality in ceu and ranks of dt, f* and d* were higher than the 95th percentile. in the case of btnl <dig>  d*, but not dt and f*, was close to statistical significance in the empirical comparison and rejected neutrality when coalescent simulations were performed.

tap <dig> and btnl <dig> are located within the classical class ii mhc sub-region  and flank a class ii hla gene cluster containing highly polymorphic genes subjected to balancing selection in humans and other primates  <cit> . we therefore wished to verify whether the selection signatures we identified at both genes might be secondary to linkage disequilibrium with hla class ii genes. thus, intergenic regions flanking the class ii hla gene cluster were also resequenced: as shown in figure  <dig>  the tap2-ctr region is telomeric to tap <dig>  while btnl2-ctr is centromeric to btnl <dig>  these two control regions have very similar divergence to the tap <dig> and btnl <dig> regions we analysed . as reported in table  <dig>  the tap2-ctr region displayed no exceptional variability and all statistics were consistent with selective neutrality. as for btnl2-ctr, a high nucleotide diversity was observed but both θw and π were about half the value observed at the btnl <dig> genic region; only f* displayed a significantly high value. therefore, high nucleotide diversity at the tap <dig> locus is not secondary to ld with hla class ii genes. in the case of btnl <dig>  the lower diversity observed at the control compared to the genic region also suggest that the gene is an independent target of balancing selection .

in order to obtain a more comprehensive description of nucleotide diversity, the four regions covering cdsn/psors1c <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  btnl <dig>  and tap <dig> were resequenced in two additional hapmap populations, namely yoruba  and east asians . for all regions, nucleotide diversity resulted extremely high in yri and eas, as well . neutrality tests and empirical comparison with resequenced regions rejected neutrality for these populations at the cdsn/psors1c <dig> and tap <dig> regions. similar results were obtained for trim10/trim <dig> in yri but not in eas. this latter finding is due to the presence of several singletons that affect sfs-based tests in this population . as for btnl <dig>  the values of sfs-based statistics were not exceptionally high in yri and eas.

a hallmark of balancing selection is an excess of polymorphism compared to neutral expectations. indeed, our data  indicate that nucleotide diversity indexes are extremely high for cdsn/psors1c <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  btnl <dig> and tap <dig>  yet, polymorphism levels also depend on local mutation rates, and under neutral evolution the amount of within- and between-species diversity is expected to be similar at all loci in the genome  <cit> . the multi-locus hka test was developed to verify this expectation  <cit> . we applied a multi-locus mlhka  test by comparing polymorphisms and divergence levels at the cdsn/psors1c <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  btnl <dig> and tap <dig> genomic regions with  <dig> niehs genes resequenced in yri, ceu and eas. the results are shown in table  <dig> and indicate that a significant excess of nucleotide diversity versus divergence is detectable in all populations for all loci. for tap <dig> and trim10/trim <dig> the chimpanzee was used for inter-species divergence. yet, divergence with chimpanzee is unusually low  for the cdsn/psors1c <dig> region and the reference sequence for orangutan is not available; as for macaque, divergence for cdsn/psors1c <dig>  is also lower than genome average but not markedly so. therefore, for cdsn/psors1c <dig> the mlhka test was performed using macaque divergence data. finally, in the case of btnl <dig>  no reference sequence for chimpanzee is available for the gene region we analysed. since a partial sequence is available for orangutan, we sequenced the genomic dna of one pongo pygmaeus  and used the sequence we obtained for calculation of divergence; therefore the mlhka test for btnl <dig> was performed with human/orangutan divergence data.

we next took advantage of the availability of data from the  <dig> genomes pilot project  <cit>  to validate our results in a larger poulation sample. the low-coverage  <dig> genomes approach, which generated whole genome sequencing data of  <dig> individuals with different ancestry , is estimated to have relatively low power to detect singleton snps or rare variants  <cit> . thus, an empirical comaprison is needed to evaluate whether selected gene regions display diversity indexes or sfs-based staistics that are exceptionally high . to this aim we randomly selected  <dig>  human genes and, from each of them, one  <dig> kb window was extracted. we next calculated diversity indexes and sfs-based statistics, as in table  <dig>  all results were confirmed using this approach . finally, we used the  <dig> genomes data to perform a sliding-window analysis of an extended genomic regions covering btnl <dig>  the mhc class ii gene cluster, and tap <dig> plus flanking regions. as shown in figure  <dig>  two peaks of diversity were observed at the btnl <dig> and tap <dig> regions we resequenced. these are separated from the mhc class ii region  by segments showing lower values of both θw and π, suggesting that they represent independent selection targets.

haplotype analysis and tmrca estimates
further insight into the evolutionary history of a gene region can be gained by inferring haplotype genealogies. this has both a descriptive purpose  and can be used to test for selection. in particular, balancing selection is expected to result in two or more major haplotype clades with a deep coalescence time . in fact, while neutrally evolving autosomal loci have tmrcas ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million years   <cit> , gene regions under balancing selection may show coalescence times dating back more than  <dig> my  <cit> . here we constructed haplotype genealogies using two approaches: a neighbour-joining network and a maximum-likelihood coalescent method implemented in genetree. this latter assumes an infinite-site model without recombination, requiring the removal of variants and haplotypes that violate these assumptions. in order to obtain more reliable trees, we selected sub-regions based on ld for those genomic regions showing high recombination rates. thus, for tap <dig> we used data from a  <dig>  kb region with relatively high ld . this region does not encompass the opposite risk snp but includes a set of markers  previously known to identify the two haplotypes that generate alternatively spliced isoforms  <cit> . as it is evident from both the network and genetree analysis , the tap <dig> genealogy is split into two major haplotype clades with an estimated time to the most recent common ancestor  of ~ <dig>  my. the two clades differ at several variants including those affecting tap <dig> splicing.

similarly, due to extensive recombination, a sub-region with stronger ld  was analysed in the case of trim10/trim <dig>  the rs <dig> variant  lies outside this region, whereas the second variant with an opposite risk profile  is located on the major branch leading to clade b . as evident in both the network and genetree analyses a single, highly divergent haplotype is observed in eas ; although several positions along the branch are recurrent and possibly originate from recombination between the two major clades or gene conversion,  <dig> snps are specific to this haplotype and represent singletons in eas, therefore affecting sfs-based statistics .

in the case of cdsn/psors1c <dig>  again we selected a  <dig> kb region of relative ld  which includes one of the two variants with opposite risk-profile . the two major clades of the genealogy have a tmrca of  <dig>  my and clade b is split into two main haplogroups that coalesce at  <dig>  my , possibly suggesting a multiallelic balancing selection regime. it is worth noting that, for the same reasons reported above, the coalescence time was calibrated on the basis of a mutation rate calculated from human/macaque divergence. the opposite-risk snp defines a subset of haplotypes in clade b .

finally, in the case of btnl <dig>  the gene portion we analysed is in relative tight ld and the network and genetree analyses were performed over the entire region. three major haplotype clades are evident with the most distantly related haplotype cluster being present in eas only .

conversely, chromosomes from all populations contribute to the two remaining clades, although with extremely different frequency. the tmrca for the whole genealogy amounts to ~  <dig> my, while the two more closely related clades coalesce at ~  <dig>  my . the branches leading to the two lower-frequency clades share some variants and their relatively close physical proximity suggests that these apparent homoplasies are due to a recombination or gene conversion event. the two variants with opposite effect are not located on the major branches of the genealogy but define haplotye subsets within the major clade .

this haplotype genealogy explains the results we obtained for sfs-based statistics in this region; the presence of two  or three  deeply separated haplotype clades introduces a high number of polymorphic sites . yet, clade  <dig> haplotypes are present at low frequency in all populations and the same applies to clade  <dig> in eas. therefore, the frequency spectrum is not markedly skewed towards intermediate frequency alleles and, consequently, most sfs-based statistics fail to reject the null hypothesis of neutrality.

nonetheless, the haplotype genealogy and tmrcas we obtained are not consistent with neutral evolution in an unstructured population but rather suggest the action of balancing selection and/or a possible contribution of archaic population structure in asia. an alternative possibility is that, as discussed below, this pattern is due to ld with hla class ii genes.

discussion
autoimmune diseases are common in industrialized societies, collectively reaching a prevalence of 5% in populations with european ancestry  <cit> . epidemiological studies have indicated that the incidence of these disorders has been steadily increasing during the last decades in the industrialized world. therefore, much scientific debate has addressed the role of human evolutionary history and adaptation in shaping the genetic predisposition to the development of autoimmunity  <cit> . for any single autoimmune condition, more than 50% of the disease risk is heritable  <cit>  and gwass have unveiled the role of several common risk variants, possibly reflecting an allelic architecture for autoimmune disease that matches a "common variant/common disease" model more closely than observed for other traits  <cit> . from the evolutionary perspective, this raises interesting questions on the forces responsible for the maintenance of disease alleles in populations . since the evolutionary history of autoimmune-related alleles is only beginning to be investigated, our knowledge is still relatively limited in this field. specifically, a subset of risk alleles for cd and uc has previously been shown to have evolved in response to pathogen-driven selective pressures, the underlying scenario for some of them being balancing selection  <cit> . more recently, several disease alleles for autoimmune conditions were reported to display signatures of directional selection in favour of the risk alleles  <cit> . finally, two common variants for t1d, an early-onset, potentially lethal disease, have been described as neutrally evolving  <cit> . albeit limited to a small number of variants, these data do not support the notion whereby autoimmune phenomena have acted as a selective pressure strong enough to affect the frequency distribution of risk alleles, although some authors have speculated that balancing selection at innate immunity genes might stem from a tuning of response to pathogens and to self  <cit> . the identification of a set of variants with an opposite risk profile for different autoimmune conditions prompted the speculation that these variants might be targets of balancing selection possibly deriving from antagonistic pleiotropy. therefore the question is: if neither allele can be considered medically favourable, are they both evolutionary beneficial under specific circumstances? our data indicate that  <dig> out of ten gene regions we analysed have been subjected to balancing selection. additionally, il18rap has previously been indicated as a possible selection target  <cit> . similarly, a signature of balancing selection has previously been described at the promoter region of il <dig>  <cit> , suggesting that the selected variant might be different from the opposite risk allele which is located downstream the transcription end site. the evidences we report herein for the tap <dig>  trim10/trim <dig>  and cdsn/psors1c <dig> gene regions are all consistent with the hypothesis whereby genetic variability is maintained at these loci by long-standing balancing selection. in the case of btnl <dig> and tap <dig>  we addressed the possibility that ld with hla class ii genes influences the results we obtained, as genetic hitch-hiking can potentially affect neutral diversity over long genomic regions. yet, the sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity across the region encompassing these two genes and hla class ii loci indicated that peaks at btnl <dig> and tap <dig> are flanked by regions with lower diversity, suggesting that these two genes represent independent  selection targets.

conversely, we identified no selection signature for the remaining  <dig> genes, namely zscan <dig>  ptpn <dig>  hla-dmb, vars <dig>  c6orf <dig>  and bat <dig>  in all these cases nucleotide diversity was within average values and no test significantly deviated from the null hypothesis of neutral evolution. one possibility is that opposite risk snps in these regions do not represent causal variants but genetic markers and, therefore, that natural selection might be acting in a region different from the one we resequenced. yet, this is unlikely to be the case for ptpn <dig>  as the opposite risk variant has been shown to be functional. the derived 602w allele, which segregates at low frequency in caucasian populations and is extremely rare outside europe, confers to the phosphatase a stronger ability to inhibit the t cell receptor signalling pathway  <cit> ; this allele has been associated with t1d, ra and other autoimmune manifestations  <cit> . conversely, the ancestral allele has been associated with a higher risk of developing cd. our analysis of the region carrying the r602w variant did not unveil any molecular signature of natural selection, as all tests were consistent with neutrality. nonetheless, the power of most tests is strongly influenced by the timing and strength of the selective pressure; it has been suggested that the 602w allele has risen in frequency in some european populations as a result of natural selection, as its frequency seems to increase with latitude  <cit> . an extremely recent selective event in these populations would not be detected using our approach.

the four targets of balancing selection we identified in this study are all located within the xmhc and have different molecular functions. tap <dig> is a central component of the antigen processing pathway; the protein products of tap <dig> and tap <dig> interact to form a transporter complex  that translocates antigenic peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum  where loading onto mhc class i molecules occurs. therefore, inhibition of tap has been exploited by different viruses as an immune evasion strategy . specifically, proteins encoded by herpesviruses , human cytomegalovirus  and epstein-barr virus can block tap function, limit the supply of peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum and therefore inhibit mhc class i maturation. interestingly, the ability of hsv- and hcmv-encoded proteins to block tap function is species-specific, suggesting that viral products have co-evolved with the tap molecules of their host species. this observation also suggests that tap <dig> and tap <dig> may be subjected to a selective pressure exerted by viruses to avoid binding of inhibitory proteins. the tap <dig> gene portion we analysed herein is subjected to a haplotype-specific alternative splicing event that results in two molecular forms differing at the c-terminus; our data show that the two haplotypes associated with alternative splicing are maintained by balancing selection. whether the two protein products are differentially sensitive to viral inhibitors is presently unknown, but a previous report has indicated that they display marked differences in the translocation efficiency of specific peptides. this difference may have an effect on the susceptibility to specific viral infections and the ala665thr variant , which is associated with alternative splicing, and located on the major branch leading to clade b  has been associated to altered susceptibility to hiv- <dig> infection  <cit> .

two genes encoding er aminopeptidases that trim peptides translocated by tap have recently been shown to be subjected to long-standing balancing selection with polymorphic variants conferring resistance against hiv- <dig>  <cit> . it is therefore tempting to speculate that maintenance of genetic diversity at genes in the antigen processing pathway derives from the differential activity of diverse alleles for specific peptides, eventually leading to distinctive repertoires of antigens presented to cd8+ t cells and, possibly, altered susceptibility to specific infections. nonetheless, it is worth noting that the allele with opposite risk profile  has a low maf  in all populations and our data suggest that it is not  the balancing selection target.

trim <dig> and trim <dig> code for two members of a large family of tripartite motif-containing  proteins. while several trim proteins have been shown to act as antiviral factors, the role of trim <dig> and trim <dig> is virtually unknown, although trim <dig> may have a role in erythropoiesis  <cit> . a recent gwas for host genetic factors involved in hiv control identified a snp  located in 3'utr of trim <dig>  within the region we analysed. our resequencing data indicate that this snp is triallelic with t/g alleles segregating in ceu and yri, and a/g in eas. this is clearly shown in the network analysis: variant  <dig> defines two different haplotype clusters one containing african and european chromosomes and the other asian haplotypes only. the variant involves a cpg dinucleotide suggesting that the triallelic status is determined by a two-hit mutation process on different haplotypic backgrounds and involving deamination of 5-methyl cytosine in the case of the a/g alleles. while the description of a triallelic variant might have a relevance for future association studies in populations with different ancestry, its location in the network suggests that the site is neutrally evolving. conversely, the thr183met variant  with opposite risk profile  is in strong ld with another nonsynonymous variant  and both snps separate the two major haplotype clades, suggesting that they may represent the selection target. the limited knowledge on the biological function of trim <dig> and trim <dig> does not allow extensive speculation on the selective pressure responsible for maintaining nucleotide diversity at these genes and further functional studies will be required to determine whether it is virus-driven or not.

the third gene region which we found to be subjected to balancing selection covers part of cdsn and psors1c <dig>  a previous work using a different dataset has also suggested that cdsn might be a balancing selection target  <cit> . cdsn and psors1c <dig> the two genes are transcribed in the opposite direction and the whole coding region of corneodesmosin  is comprised within the first intron of psors1c <dig> . both transcripts are widely expressed http://biogps.gnf.org and have been associated with psoriasis in several studies. specifically, cdsn is up-regulated in psoriatic lesisons  <cit>  and one psoriasis-associated allele  affects the binding of an unknown cellular factor, resulting in increased transcript stability  <cit> . this snp is located on the network branch separating the two major haplotype clades, suggesting that it may represent the selected variant. similarly, one of the two snps  with an opposite effect on autoimmune diseases defines a major haplotype group within clade b, indicating that it may represent  a selection target .

the role of the protein product of psors1c <dig> is presently unknown, although one snp in psors1c <dig> immediately downstream the region we analysed has been associated through gwas with white blood cell counts  <cit>  and a second downstream variant with delayed aids progression  <cit> . conversely the role of cdsn is well studied as the gene encodes corneodesmosin, an adhesive protein which participates in the stabilization of corneodesmosomes in the skin and other cornified squamous epithelia. loss of coreneodesmosin in humans results in generalised peeling skin disease, a condition characterized by skin barrier defects, pruritus and atopy, with patients also showing staphylococcus aureus superinfections  <cit> . mice lacking cdsn display a severe phenotype and the skin barrier defect is accompanied by a 10-fold increase in transepithelial water loss. these observations highlight the central role played by the epidermal barrier in protection from infections and in water homeostasis, two processes that are though to have been targeted by natural selection during human evolutionary history. therefore, snps in cdsn may have been maintained by balancing selection due to their modulation of the skin barrier properties. still, the observation that humans with genetic defects in cdsn also display food allergies  <cit>  suggests that the protein may play a role in processes unrelated to skin function.

finally, btnl <dig> encodes a butrophilin-like, widely expressed protein with still poorly understood function. experiments in mice have suggested that btnl <dig> might function as a negative co-stimulatory molecule with inhibitory activity on t cell activation  <cit> . in particular, a possible modulatory role for the protein in intestine inflammation has been proposed in this animal model, in line with the observation that a snp  in the region we analysed has also been associated with uc  <cit> .

the haplotype genealogy of the btnl <dig> region we resequenced is peculiar with one deeply separated clade limited to eas subjects. previous studies have suggested that such tree topologies might originate from admixture of anatomically modern humans with archaic hominin populations  rather than by a selective force; yet, a tmrca >  <dig> my may be unlikely even under ancient admixture scenarios  <cit> . therefore, we suggest that the distantly related clade is maintained by a selective process acting on btnl <dig> or on the nearby class ii mhc loci. as reported above, the coalescence time of the two more closely related clades is also deep and several nonsynonymous variants are located on the major branches . specifically, 3d modelling of btnl <dig>  <cit>  indicated that the pro285leu, met286ile and pro299gln variants are all located in close physical proximity within the igc domain and adjacent to cystein residues involved in disulfide bonding. these variants are postulated to be functional  <cit>  and can be regarded as potential selection targets. conversely both the opposite risk alleles and the uc susceptibility variant identify haplotype subsets within the major clade .

therefore, even in those regions where we did identify balancing selection signatures, the opposite risk alleles do not always represent  the selected variants. rather, our data suggest that, with the exclusion of rs <dig> and rs <dig> in trim <dig> and cdsn, opposite risk snps are likely to have accumulated as neutral variants, possibly maintained through hitch-hiking with the balanced polymorphisms. an alternative possibility is that, as in the case of the gene regions that we described as neutrally evolving, weaker and more recent selective events have been maintaining the opposite risk alleles. in this respect it is worth noting that the haplotype structure of the gene regions we analysed is often complex, raising the possibility that the opposite risk profile identified for some of these snps is secondary to association with another causal variant which is not analysed in the association study. in the case of btnl <dig>  for example, we were able to include two opposite risk alleles in the network analysis; based on the risk profiles of variants  <dig> and  <dig>  we were able to identify a set of haplotypes that should confer increased risk for atd  and a group of haplotypes that predispose to ms  . this means that rs <dig> and rs <dig> may simply define haplotype subsets that carry causal variants for ms and atd but when these variants are not typed in the association study, the haplotype structure is such that the derived allele of at position  <dig> will be under-represented among ms patients for example, resulting in an apparent protective effect. a similar situation might apply to cdsn, as well .

CONCLUSIONS
data herein indicate that balancing selection is common within the xmhc region and involves several non-hla loci. yet, the evolutionary history of most snps with an opposite effect for autoimmune diseases is consistent with evolutionary neutrality. we suggest that variants with an opposite effect on autoimmune diseases should not be considered a distinct class of disease alleles from the evolutionary perspective. moreover, in a few cases, the opposite effect on distinct diseases may derive from complex haplotype structures in regions where genetic diversity is high and typing in association studies only captures limited information.
