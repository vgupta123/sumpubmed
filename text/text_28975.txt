BACKGROUND
calcium signal transduction through calcium channels is a fundamental mechanism used by plants to sense and respond to endogenous and environmental stimuli  <cit> , including hormone responses  <cit> , plant–pathogen interaction  <cit> , development  <cit> , symbiosis  <cit> , salt stress  <cit> , light signaling  <cit> , and circadian rhythm  <cit> . one of the potential pathways for the uptake of ca2+ ions in signal transduction is via cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels   <cit> . cngcs, functionally defined as ligand-gated protein channels, are nonselective cation channels, gated by the direct binding of cyclic nucleotides, and are present in both animals and plants system . in animals, their biological roles and regulation have been well studied, however, plant cngcs have only been investigated much more recently, and corresponding regulatory mechanisms are just starting to be discovered  <cit> . studies have revealed that cngcs may function as a pathway for ca2+ conduction into the cytosol as an early event during pathogen defense signaling cascades  <cit> , and plant response to other biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> .

plant cngc ion channels were first identified in a screen for calmodulin  binding partners in barley  <cit> . a large family of cngcs composed of  <dig> members have been identified in arabidopsis genome  <cit>  which are classified into four groups  and two sub-groups “iv-a and iv-b”  <cit> . these cngcs are characterized by general structural resemblance to animal cngcs  <cit> , having a predicted structure of six transmembrane domains  with a pore domain  between s <dig> and s <dig>  c-terminal cyclic nucleotide-binding domain  and cam-binding domains   <cit> . in the presence of ca2+, cam binds to the cngc at the αc helix of the cnbd and thus blocks channel gating by cnmps  <cit> . cnbd being most conserved region of the cngc with a phosphate binding cassette  and a “hinge” region . where, the pbc binds to the sugar and phosphate moieties of the cyclic nucleotide  ligand  <cit> , and the hinge region contributes to ligand binding efficacy and selectivity  <cit> . in arabidopsis, cngc genes are differentially expressed in all tissues and their functions critically depend on the presence of camp and/or cgmp that function as signaling molecules . physiological processes in which these signaling molecules are believed to be involved include various developmental processes, photo-morphogenesis and tolerance to salt stress  <cit> , gibberellic acid-induced signaling in barley  <cit>  and phytochrome signaling  <cit> .

approximately 5% of the oryza sativa genome appears to encode membrane transport proteins. many of these proteins are classified and several hundred putative transporters have not yet been assigned to families, including the cngc gene family  <cit> . the early investigations on rice genome, revealed a clue about the existence of putative cngc fragments, as suggested by bridges et al.  <cit>  and ramanjaneyulu et al.  <cit> . however, no comprehensive study has yet been undertaken, which can lead to the proper identification, characterization and functional verification of the cngc family in rice.

taking privilege from the accessibility of recent release of entire genome sequences of rice and information available from a. thaliana, we performed a genome-wide identification of cngc family in rice in the present study. we found that the rice genome contains  <dig> cngc full length genes which are classified into four major classes and two sub-groups as in arabidopsis. evolutionary history reconstruction via comparison with cngcs from other plant species was accomplished. furthermore, comprehensive analyses were performed to characterize these genes and protein sequence features e.g., domain, motif, phylogenetic relationships, gene structure, multiple alignment, cis-acting regulatory elements etc. to verify their functions, we analyzed the expression pattern of rice cngc genes by quantitative pcr  in response to various hormonal, biotic and abiotic stresses. the present work represents the first comprehensive study of cngc genes in rice and offers a solid base for further functional investigation of this important gene family in rice.

RESULTS
identification of cngc genes in rice genome
to obtain a complete overview of cngc gene family in rice, we conducted a genome-wide analysis by using various bioinformatics resources. considering the fact that the arabidopsis cngc gene family is fully characterized, we used the amino acid  sequences of  <dig> arabidopsis cngc genes as the queries in blast searches and the keyword ‘cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel’ in the putative function search tool of rice database . seventeen non-redundant putative gene sequences were retrieved in rice with five genes  having potential alternative splice forms.

since plant cngcs, are characterized by the presence of cnbd, specifically phosphate binding cassettes and hinge region  <cit> , thus their presence in a protein sequence is a validation criteria for these genes. the sequence searches of databases based on annotation are not completely accurate and could potentially miss some bonafide cngc sequences or inaccurately assign certain sequences as cngcs  <cit> . therefore, the deduced protein sequences of all the  <dig> putative genes were further analyzed to confirm the presence of cnbd/cyclic nucleotide-monophosphate binding domain , cap family effector domain , rmlc-like jelly roll fold , and ion transport domains. we found that loc_os06g <dig>  previously designated as “genomic cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channel 1”, was identified as “cyclic nucleotide-gated channel c ”, and was eradicated from analysis due to lack of above cited domains. however, a  <dig> aa short fragment, loc_os06g <dig>  contained the cngc characteristic cnbd domain, with phosphate binding cassettes and hinge region as suggested by zelman et al.  <cit> , was recognized as bonafide cngc. these identifications were purely based on the presence of primary cnbd domain, and the validation of the consensus motif derived by zelman et al.  <cit> . we noticed that blast search of arabidopsis cngc also resulted into gene from potassium akt /kat channels  as homologs of cngcs, due to the presence of transmembrane region, cnbd and ion transport domains and additional ankyrin repeats  <cit> . such unrelated genes were rejected from analysis. finally,  <dig> full length cngc genes were confirmed to contain the specific domains in their proteins sequences, and hence were identified as cngc genes in rice .table  <dig>

oscngcs chromosomal localization and diversification
chromosome localization analysis demonstrated that the oscngcs are located on eight rice chromosomes  . to better reflect the orthologous relationship between the rice and arabidopsis cngc genes, the nomenclature of respective rice cngc genes was annotated according to their order in phylogenies, with os abbreviating o. sativa .figure  <dig> 
genomic localization and duplication of cngc genes in rice chromosomes. chromosome numbers are indicated at the top of each chromosome. genes are marked in abbreviations i.e. c stands for cngc; those present on duplicated segments of genome are connected by red lines and tandem duplicated genes are marked in blue.



arabidopsis has been reported to have  <dig> cngc genes   <cit> . conversely, in rice that has a genome size nearly three times as that of arabidopsis   <cit> , the number of cngc genes was found to be only  <dig>  the reason for this could be the variable status of whole genome duplications in arabidopsis and rice   <cit> . in this study, both segmental and tandem duplication events were investigated for elucidating the potential mechanism of evolution of oscngc gene family in rice. analysis of pgdd revealed that three genes pairs, oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig>  oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig>  as well as oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> located on different chromosomes regions, might have been induced by segmental duplication, and could be assigned to rgap segmental duplication blocks . in addition, one gene pair, oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> were located at the adjacent positions on chromosome  <dig> and separated by  <dig> genes only. hence suggested, that these two genes were generated from tandem duplication event . these results indicate that gene duplication not only expanded the number of genes in the rice cngc family but also increased its functional diversity .

gene structure and features of oscngc proteins
comparisons between genomic dna sequences with corresponding cdna sequences showed that coding sequences of oscngc genes are interrupted by introns. introns may interrupt the reading frame of a gene between two consecutive codons , between the first and second nucleotide of a codon , or between the second and the third nucleotide   <cit> . gene structural analysis showed that the rice cngcs had different gene structures as compared to arabidopsis cngcs, with a variable number of introns and lengths. the numbers of introns in arabidopsis cngcs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> introns, while rice cngc ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> introns. unlike the arabidopsis cngcs, introns of all oscngcs belong to phase  <dig> and  <dig> , while, arabidopsis cngc <dig> contained, four phase  <dig> introns. this suggests that all cngcs with introns did not ascend from a retrotransposition event, and the different numbers may be caused by the insertion and loss of introns during their evolution  <cit> .

the  <dig> oscngc proteins range in length from  <dig>  to  <dig>  amino acids , with an average of  <dig> aa. expasy analysis showed that oscngc proteins vary greatly in isoelectric point  values  and molecular weights . according to their instability index values, only  <dig>  of  <dig> oscngc proteins can be considered as stable with an instability index of < =  <dig>   <cit> .table  <dig>

the subcellular localization of each oscngc was predicted by psort analysis. our results evidenced that thirteen oscngcs  are predicted to be localized in plasma membrane, while the others i.e., oscngc <dig>  oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> to be in cytoplasm, chloroplast thylakoid membrane and mitochondrial inner membrane, respectively . all relevant experiments in the past have indicated that plant cngc proteins are specifically localized to the plasma membrane  <cit> . the presence of oscngc <dig> in cytoplasm is not clear, which needs further experimental elucidation. arabidopsis cngc proteins, when analyzed revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> cngc proteins were localized in plasma membrane, while the other  <dig> in chloroplast thylakoid membrane .

translated proteins are often subjected to post–translational modifications  to become functionally active. ptms are the chemical modification of a protein after its translation, and have wide effects on broadening its range of functionality  <cit> . cngc channels can be controlled by variations in the phosphorylation state catalyzed by ser/thr kinases  <cit>  and phosphatases  <cit> . when analyzed in scanprosite, multiple putative phosphorylation sites were revealed in oscngc protein sequences, which may act as substrates for several kinases in the form of casein kinase ii, protein kinase c, tyrosine kinase and camp/cgmp kinases  <cit> . francis and corbin  <cit>  demonstrated that camp/cgmp-dependent protein kinases are major intracellular receptors for these nucleotides , and the actions of these enzymes account for much of the cellular responses to increased levels of camp or cgmp.

as a special class of ptms, several proteins including cngcs could be covalently altered by a range of lipids, such as myristate and palmitate, a phenomenon known as lipidation  <cit> . protein n-myristoylation can alter the lipophilicity of the target protein and facilitate its interaction with membranes thereby affecting its subcellular localization . our bioinformatics analysis revealed that all oscngc proteins bear potential n-myristoylation/ n-glycosylation motif sites. the maximum number of n-myristoylation sites is present in oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> , while oscngc <dig> contain highest number  of n-glycosylation sites. in mammals, n-myristoylated proteins include protein kinases, phosphatases, guanine nucleotide-binding proteins , and ca2+-binding proteins, many of which participate in signal transduction pathways  <cit> . similarly, n-glycosylation, post-translational modification that occur in many eukaryotic proteins exposed to the extracellular medium , is reported to play various roles, including facilitating the folding, trafficking and function of the protein as well as protecting it from an extracellular medium, which, in plants, is acidic and rich in proteases  <cit> . in a recent study, meighan et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that extracellular ca2+ and zn2+-dependent proteases  increase the ligand sensitivity of rod and cone cng channels, and prolonged exposure of cng channels to mmp even caused the channels to become nonconductive due to mmp-dependent proteolysis. they have further indicated that presence of glycosylation sites may defend cng channels from mmp-dependent proteolysis, and prevent the cngc channels to become nonconductive  <cit> . therefore the ptms and other sequence-specific features such as n-myristoylation and n-glycosylation in rice cngcs are likely to be necessary for their proper functioning, localization and regulation .

motif composition analysis
a functional motif-based recognition of cngc proteins can contribute to understanding the evolutionary history of this gene family including possible role of genome and gene duplication events  <cit> . motif search by the meme/mast identified  <dig> conserved motifs in rice cngc proteins . among these, five motifs  were identified in rice, and found to be associated with functionally defined domains . all the oscngc proteins share a conserved binding domain for cyclic nucleotides  in the central region, referred to as motif  <dig>  plant cngcs are believed to be activated by direct and reversible binding of nucleotides cgmp and camp to the cnbd, which allosterically causes the channel to open  <cit> . in the presence of calcium, cam binds to the cambd and prevents the binding of cyclic nucleotides to the cnbd, and thereby stops the activation of cngcs by cyclic nucleotides  <cit> . this competitive regulation by cyclic nucleotides and cams was predicted  <cit>  and experimentally verified for atcngc <dig>  <cit> . the cam-binding site was recently mapped to an isoleucine glutamine  motif by fischer et al.  <cit> . our results also identified iq as a functional motif  within cambd, downstream of the cnbd . iq motifs have been investigated in detail in animal proteins, which often bind cam in a ca2+-dependent manner, while ca2+ induces the displacement of the cam ligand  <cit> . fischer et al.  <cit>  showed that iq motif is conserved among plant cngcs, this motif enhances the variability of ca2+-dependent channel control mechanisms featuring the functional diversity within this multigene family. however, in rice, iq motifs were present in less than 50% of the members of oscngc family, mainly in the members of group  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  , suggesting that other regulators may alter the channel opening and for gating control of plant cngcs which lack these motifs  <cit> . other functional motifs denoted as motif  <dig>  and  <dig>  associated with prenyltransferase and squalene oxidase repeat, and ion transport, respectively, was found to be conserved in all oscngc proteins except oscngc <dig>  the functions of other motifs identified in oscngc proteins  <dig>  5– <dig>  9– <dig>  and  <dig> have not been reported in any plant or animal so far. moreover, the sequence logo of three potential motifs, cnbd, iq and ion transport one can determine not only the consensus sequence but also the relative frequency of bases and the information content  at every position in a site or sequence. the logo displays both significant residues and subtle sequence patterns .figure  <dig>

we also performed meme analysis on  <dig> arabidopsis cngc proteins for comparison. the diagram of atcngc motifs, their details and the sequence logo of functional motifs is given in additional files  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  the numbers of motifs are designated similarly in both rice and arabidopsis cngc proteins, each corresponding to the position/location of the respective motif. in arabidopsis, only three motifs  were identified representing the cnbd domain, and iq motif, where cnbd domain was represented by two motifs  interrupted by  <dig> non-functional motifs. interestingly, motifs associated with ion transport, zinc finger, prenyltransferase and squalene oxidase repeat were absent in arabidopsis . though, individual scan of atcngc proteins revealed the presence of ion transport domain in some members .

as mentioned earlier, an essential structural feature of plant cngcs is their cnbd, a direct binding site for camp/cgmp to modify the channel opening  <cit> . the most conserved feature of cnbd domain is the pbc that makes direct contact with camp  <cit> , and the hinge region, essential for the capping of camp by the c-helix of the cnbd  <cit> . no plant cngc-specific motifs had been reported until zelman et al.  <cit>  aligned the pbc and hinge regions for  <dig> atcngc proteins, from which the following consensus motif was derived: --x--x-g-x--ll-x- <cit> -x--e-x-f- <cit> ). similarly we aligned the cnbd region of rice cngcs  and identified a putative pbc and a hinge . we identified a conserved  glycine , acidic residue glutamate  followed by two aliphatic leucines  and aromatic tryptophan  inside the pbcs . we also detected that the putative hinge also comprises a conserved  aromatic phenylalanine , aliphatic alanine  and leucines  . a neutral residue, threonine  was also found to be conserved  near the hinge region. we successively built a stringent motif: --x--x-g--ell-x-w-x-sa-x-t-x--af-x-l) that recognizes the  <dig> rice cngcs specifically. the rice pbc and hinge regions differed from the conserved residues of arabidopsis. for example, residues e, w and t within pbcs, and residues a and l in hinges were found be conserved at 100% in rice cngcs only. the diversity of motif patterns between the rice and arabidopsis indicate the functional divergence across the species and individual groups.figure  <dig> 
the rice cngc-specific motif spans the putative pbc and the hinge within the cnbd of the  <dig> oscngcs. the diagram at the top represents three regions of plant cngcs: the six transmembrane domains , a cnbd containing a pbc and the hinge, and cambd. the rice cngc-specific amino acid motif is shown below the cartoon. in the square brackets “” are the amino acids allowed in this position of the motif, “x” represents any amino acid and the round brackets “()” indicate the number of amino acids. below is the alignment of cnbd domains of  <dig> rice cngcs. residues in white highlighted in blue indicate 100% identity among the  <dig> rice cngcs.



phylogenetic analysis
phylogenetic relationship between rice and arabidopsiscngc family genes
to determine the phylogenic relationship of cngc family between rice and arabidopsis, a maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree was constructed using full-length amino acid sequences. four groups, as described by mäser et al.  <cit>  were identified containing representative gene of both rice and arabidopsis. all the arabidopsis cngc proteins were found to lie in groups similar to those identified previously  <cit> . of the four groups, three groups  are monophyletic, while one group  is sub-divided into two distinct clades, named group iv-a and iv-b . group i comprises three members from rice cngcs  and six from arabidopsis . similarly, group ii contains three rice cngcs  and five atcngcs . however, group iii embraces five in rice  and five in arabidopsis , thus form the largest group, with  <dig> members. two cngcs from each rice  and arabidopsis  were assigned to group iv-a, while, three rice cngcs  and two arabidopsis cngcs  segregated into group iv-b . a separate phylogenetic tree was also generated from conserved cnbd domains sequences of all the cngc proteins in rice and arabidopsis, which resulted into similar clustering pattern.figure  <dig> 
phylogenetic tree of oscngc and atcngc proteins. the multiple alignment was performed by clustalx program. mega  <dig>  was used to create the maximum likelihood  under the jones-taylor-thornton  model. the bootstrap values from  <dig> resampling are given at each node. the rice cngc genes identified in this study are shown in red circles and arabidopsis cngcs are shown in blue squares. rice cngc genes were designated according to their order in phylogeny.



during the evolution of a gene family, gene duplication plays important roles in generating new members and creating novel gene functions, hence increasing numbers and diversifying functions of genes within a gene family  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis between rice and arabidopsis following previously described model  <cit>  demonstrates the evolutionary trend of gene duplication in both taxa.

phylogenetic data provide a framework for making more appropriate intergenomic comparisons, by determining whether chromosomal duplications within taxa pre-date or post-date divergence among taxa  <cit> . the current analysis shows that divergence of two taxa may have pre-dated the gene duplication events among them resulting in gene expansion within individual group  <cit>  . this is further strengthened by our detailed phylogenetic analysis among all plant lineages given ahead. the detailed phylogeny also points towards the duplication of cngc genes occurring after speciation and after divergence of angiosperms into mono and dicots. interestingly atcngc <dig> and oscngc14; atcngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> are not in congruence with the pattern of other sister groups. the existing anomaly between these taxa could not be reasoned out.

phylogenetic analysis of the cngcgenes in all plant lineages
for a better understanding of the evolutionary history of the cngc gene family, we comprehensively analyzed the phylogeny and evolution of the cngc gene family in all plant lineages. we used the amino acid sequences of rice and arabidopsis cngcs to query the orthologdb, gramene, tair, congenie, ncbi, phytozome and rgap databases of plant species . in order to obtain only specific cngc sequences, we removed the hits with exact duplicates , annotated fragments, as well as any unrelated gene like akt or kat family channels from subsequent analyses . we identified  <dig> cngc-like sequences from  <dig> different species including green algae , bryophytes , lycophytes , gymnosperms , monocots  and dicots   <cit> , whose protein sequences harbored typical domains and motifs of cngc proteins, i.e. cnbd , ion transport  and iq . the copy number of cngc gene family ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> amongst the species, where, glycine max had the largest cngc gene family containing  <dig> genes . however, it should be indicated that the single cngc in wild banana  may not reflect the true number of cngc genes in this species; rather it is due to the limited availability of its genomic information.

a maximum likelihood tree was generated using amino acid sequences of the deduced full-length peptides with jtt  model. we used syg <dig> from saccharomyces cerevisiae as out-group  <cit> . according to the tree’s topology, cngc gene family of all plant lineages clustered into four distinct groups  with significant bootstrap values . group ii and group iv are subdivided into ii-a/ii-b and iv-a/iv-b. all the cngcs from algae formed the basal lineage and clustered into same group , whereas those from the land plants grouped into several other groups , showing that the cngc family originated earlier than the separation of green algae and the ancestor of land plants. among these four groups, only group ii was conserved in all land plants, showing that all cngc genes from land plants shared a mutual ancestor after the divergence from aquatic plants. group ii-b was solely present in lower land plants including mosses  and lycophytes. similarly, cngcs from group i expanded in both mono- and dicotyledonous angiosperms, while group ii-a and iii was prevalent in all embryophytes  . group iv-a contain cngcs from vascular plants i.e., embryophytes and lyophytes. these analyses revealed that all cngc genes from land plants originated from a common ancestor, earlier than the split between lower and higher land plants  <cit> , while the lineage specific expansion and divergence happened in higher land plants, particularly in dicots, after diversification from lower land plants, which lead to generation of group ii-b in basal land plant and group i-iv in higher land plants. moreover, cngc genes from similar lineage, such as mosses, lycophytes, gymnosperms and angiosperms, inclined to be clustered together. our interpretations are corroborated by the findings of previous studies  <cit> .figure  <dig>

family genes in  <dig> representative plant species. the rooted maximum-likelihood  phylogenetic tree was inferred from the amino acid sequences alignment of full length proteins using mega  <dig> , under the jones-taylor-thornton  model. the bootstrap values from  <dig> resampling, and cut-off values >70% are given at each node. the node color specifies group i.e. pink = i, light green = ii-a, aqua = ii-b, red = iii, blue = iv-a, and black = iv-b. rice cngc genes are shown in blue color. plant lineages are shown by shapes with different colors, i.e. green circle = dicots, maroon diamond = monocots, green diamond = gymnosperms, aqua blue square = lycophytes, pink square = moss, and black triangles = green algae.



in silicoprediction of potential cis-acting regulatory elements
the cis-acting regulatory elements are important molecular switches involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes during biotic and abiotic stress responses, and may be induced through independent signal transduction pathways  <cit> . the 5′ upstream noncoding sequences are not well conserved among the oscngc genes , signifying that these genes may be differentially expressed in response to various stimuli, even if they encode identical proteins  <cit> . to obtain a preliminary clue about the regulatory function and the molecular mechanism of oscngc genes in transcriptional regulation, potential cis-acting regulatory elements in upstream  sequences of the cngc genes were analyzed. results exhibited that oscngc gene promoter sequences contain numerous cis-acting regulatory elements regulatory sites for hormones, different biotic and abiotic factors . twenty different cis-acting regulatory elements are regulated by aba; among them, myb recognition site  related to the drought- and aba-induced gene expression  <cit> , is conserved among  <dig> oscngc genes. moreover, only  <dig> elements  are regulated by ethylene, two elements  are regulated by cytokinin . the patterns of cis-acting regulatory elements differed significantly among the oscngc genes. for example, the promoter of nine oscngcs  contain elements that may respond to all these hormones, biotic and abiotic stress, while others lack the elements responsive to ethylene and cytokinin . comparatively, only three elements were found to be conserved and consistently present in the upstream region of all  <dig> oscngcs, i.e. two abiotic stress signaling related elements, consensus gt- <dig> binding site  and myc recognition site , and wrky transcription factor . the wrky transcription factor  is reported as binding site of rice wrky <dig>  a transcriptional repressor of the gibberellin signaling pathway  <cit> , and a core of tgac-containing w-box in wrky <dig>  which plays an important role in the regulation of early defense-response genes in rice. the presence of most these cis-acting regulatory elements in oscngc gene promoters depicts their importance in regulation of this gene family .table  <dig>

expression analysis of oscngcs
plant cngc genes have been implicated in diverse aspects of plant growth and development, including responses to hormonal, abiotic and biotic stress  <cit> . in past, many plant mutants of cngcs, and transgenic plants expressing full-length or mutant cngcs, were characterized to explore their role in plants  <cit> . these researches mainly focused on arabidopsis cngcs and found that cngc mutants exhibit various phenotypes and multi-functional behaviors. briefly, atcngc <dig> are probably involved in ca2+ uptake into plants  <cit> , atcngc <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in plant defense and disease resistance pathway  <cit> , atcngc <dig> in homeostasis  <cit> , and atcngc <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in plant development . to obtain information about potential differential gene functions in rice, we employed bioinformatics and experimental approaches to assess the role of oscngcs in plant development, and expression patterns in response to various stress.

expression of oscngcsin development
the expression profile of rice leaves obtained from public database ricexpro exhibited that most of oscngc genes showed their maximum expression in late vegetative and early reproductive stage  during life cycle of rice in field conditions, while, oscngc <dig> had its highest expression level at early vegetative stage. overall, highest expression was observed for oscngc <dig> at 118th day during late reproductive stage, while lowest expression was noted for oscngc <dig> at 20th day of rice growth in field conditions .

expression of oscngcs in rice seedlings
by using quantitative real-time pcr  analysis, the expression level of oscngc genes was investigated in leaves of the rice cultivar nipponbare . the results indicated there were tremendous variations among the oscngc genes . oscngc <dig> and  <dig> were highly expressed and had transcripts abundances of  <dig> and  <dig> times that of oscngc <dig>  while oscngc <dig> had the lowest transcripts abundances .figure  <dig>

the expression of several cngc genes in rice is regulated by plant hormones. in general, more genes were up-regulated by aba  and iaa  as compared to kn  and eth . in sharp contrast, twelve and  <dig> genes were significantly down-regulated by kn and eth, respectively, while none and  <dig> genes were down-regulated by aba and iaa, respectively . the cngc genes belonging to different phylogenetic groups showed different expression levels from each other, depending on the treatment type, while the genes in the same group showed a similar expression pattern. for example, the expression of oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig>  was simultaneously up-regulated by all but eth treatments . it has been proposed that the proteins classified in the same classes may have similar functions  <cit> . similar conclusion has been drawn by ma et al.  <cit> , while studying the expression of the c3hc4-type ring finger gene family in rice.

response to biotic and abiotic stress
to determine oscngcs role in disease resistance, we quantified gene expression levels in 4 weeks old rice seedlings, inoculated with two phytopathogens, xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae  and pseudomonas fuscovaginae, that cause a serious blight and bacterial sheath brown rot of rice, respectively. the expression of the oscngc family genes at  <dig> hpi  are shown in figure  <dig>  the data depicted that large number of oscngc genes were significantly up-regulated after infection with each pathogen within 4 h. fourteen oscngcs were significantly up-regulated by p. fuscovaginae inoculation with oscngc <dig> being at the highest relative level of expression. the expression of oscngc <dig> and  <dig> were not affected . similarly  <dig> oscngcs were up-regulated by xoo, where the expression of oscngc <dig> and  <dig> increased by  <dig>  and  <dig> -folds respectively. previous genetic approaches have identified three cngcs in arabidopsis  exhibited alterations in defense responses and reported to be involved in plant immunity  <cit> . these two mutants are reported to have successfully managed the lower growth rates of p. syringae, accomplished by sustaining high levels of salicylic acid, leading to constitutive expression of pathogenesis-related  genes, and other defense responses  <cit> . it is noteworthy to mention that atcngc <dig> &  <dig> are the closest homologue of the members of rice cngcs from group iv, which showed highest expression levels in response to p. fuscovaginae, suggesting that these oscngc genes are early responsive and sensitive to biotic stress, and their regulation plays an important role in plant defense.

similarly, the expression levels of the oscngc family genes under cold stress condition were also investigated. the results indicated that  <dig> oscngcs were up-regulated under cold stress. it was noted that the expression of oscngcs belonging to phylogenetic group i, ii and iii were significantly induced by cold stress, with fold range of 5– <dig> for group i , 3– <dig> for group ii , and 4– <dig> folds for group iii , respectively . on other hand, oscngcs from group iv  showed relatively lower expression under cold stress. overall, oscngc <dig> gene showed the highest expression level  in response to cold stress, while oscngc <dig> showed the lowest level expression  .

interestingly, six of  <dig> gene pairs located on duplicated chromosomal segments showed differential expression patterns, suggesting that most duplicated gene pairs were under the diverse transcriptional controls. for example, oscngc <dig> and oscngc <dig> localized on duplicated segments exhibit similar expression patterns in response to both pathogenic and abiotic stresses , indicating their overlapping functions. this finding was similar to previous results showing that the expression of duplicated genes frequently diverges compared to that of their ancestors, suggesting that duplication was a major reason for the enrichment of the functions of this family during the long course of evolution  <cit> . it is proposed that a change in a duplicated locus of two genes might not exhibit the same morphological and/or physiological phenotypes. however, when gene duplication occurs, some genes may retain their original functions and expression patterns  <cit> . no close correlation was observed between cis-acting regulatory elements in upstream sequences of rice cngc genes and their qpcr expression levels. it is probable that the differential response of genes to different stimuli is due to different upstream sequences and introns. these results suggest that many of the oscngc genes play discrete roles in development, response to stress and plant defense related functions in rice. however, further studies based on gene knockout techniques are required to properly identify and explore their functions.

CONCLUSIONS
there are  <dig> cngc genes in rice, which are classified into  <dig> groups  and two sub-groups ; this gene family appears to have expanded through both chromosomal segmentation and tandem duplications. the cngcs from all plant lineages are also clustered into four groups, with group ii being conserved in all land plants. all the oscngc protein sequences contain a cngc specific domain cnbd that comprises a pbc and a “hinge” region, featured by a stringent motif: --x--x-g--ell-x-w-x-sa-x-t-x--af-x-l). various cis-acting regulatory elements were identified in the upstream sequences present on both positive and negative strands. in addition, the genes transcripts significantly respond to multiple stimuli, as demonstrated by their expression patterns to exogenous hormonal , biotic  and abiotic  stresses.
