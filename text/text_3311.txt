BACKGROUND
cattle are still playing a major role in africa for food supply, to generate income and draught power or for ceremonial purposes. archaeological, historical and anthropological evidence combined with recent genetic data  <cit>  have provided insights into the complex origins of present day west-african cattle diversity. indeed, although their wild ancestor bos primigenius was not native to sub-saharan africa, west african cattle populations are representative of both shorthorn  and longhorn  humpless taurines, humped zebus  and zebu/taurine hybrid cattle. this early suggested that west african cattle has originated from several successive and recent colonization events  <cit> . briefly, shorthorn taurines were introduced from the middle-east and possibly north africa around  <dig>  years bp  <cit>  while longhorn taurine probably arrived at an earlier period  following different migration routes  <cit> . although, zebu cattle first penetrated through the horn of africa in the late 2nd millennium bc, the major wave of indicine introgression really started with the arab settlements along the east coast of africa from the end of the 7th century ad. zebu cattle spread even more recently over west africa with movements of pastoralist people such as the fulani  <cit> .

as a consequence of their remote origin, west african cattle populations have been subjected in recent times to new environmental pressures imposing strong adaptive constraints  <cit> . indeed, tropical climate conditions might have affected several traits such as reproduction, grazing behavior, feed/water intake and utilization, milk production and growth. for instance, some west african shorthorn cattle which are exposed to very harsh conditions have been subjected to a marked reduction in size  <cit> . in addition, cattle were exposed to new pathogens in particular parasites. a well described example of newly acquired adaptation to parasitic disease is the ability, known as trypanotolerance, of taurine cattle to survive, reproduce and remain productive within the tsetse infested sub-tropical zone characterized by a high prevalence of trypanosomiasis   <cit> . this might have in turn limited the introgression in these areas of zebus which are trypanosusceptible .

west african cattle populations thus represent an appealing model to unravel the genome response to adaptation to tropical conditions. the purpose of this study was to perform a whole genome scan for footprints of adaptive selection based on a newly collected genotyping data set containing  <dig>  snps genotyped on  <dig> west african cattle populations from different bovine sub-species and agro-ecological areas . in particular, we sampled populations on both side of the tsetse infested zone. based on this large data set, we first carried out a detailed analysis of the genetic structure of these populations. we next performed a scan for differentiation among snps under a full bayesian framework  <cit>  for which we proposed additional extensions to improve the detection of loci under selection. we then annotated regions containing snps subjected to selection, adopting a systems biology approach to highlight the main underlying physiological functions.

RESULTS
snp polymorphism
in total,  <dig> individuals belonging to  <dig> different cattle populations, nine of which originating from west africa , were genotyped for the bovinesnp <dig> chip assay containing  <dig>  snps mainly derived from sequences available in european cattle breeds  <cit> . among the autosomal snps that passed quality control analyses , we retained the  <dig>  snps polymorphic  in at least one west-african taurine and one west african zebu populations. as expected and shown in figure s1a , this snp selection procedure, leading mainly to the elimination of snps from european origin, resulted in a relative increase in calculated heterozygosity for all but outgroup taurine populations . in addition, as revealed by the distribution of the maf for the different populations , the remaining differences in heterozygosity among populations were mainly explained by the proportion of snps with rare variants . in particular, marker polymorphism remained clearly lower in west african taurine populations , the proportion of snps with a maf <  <dig>  being the highest  in lag which also displayed the lowest average heterozygosity . these observations are in agreement with previous studies based on microsatellite markers on the same populations  <cit>  and might essentially be explained by the recent demographic history of west african taurine cattle characterized by a marked isolation associated with a strong effective population size decrease . although west african zebus  and hybrids  displayed more genetic diversity than west african taurines in our study , zfu, zch and zma levels of polymorphism were clearly lower than, and bor and kur ones similar to the taurine outgroup  ones . nevertheless, studies based on microsatellite data  revealed that heterozygosities of zch, zfu, bor and kur were higher than european breeds' ones  which were themselves similar to zma. the lack of zebu specific sequences in the snp discovery process might explain these apparent discrepancies.

analysis of population structure
the neighbor-joining tree based on allele sharing distances   <cit>  allowed us to unambiguously separate individuals according to their population of origin . west african individuals branched in their expected intermediary position relatively to the taurine  and zebu  outgroups. moreover, west african zebus  were closer to zma while west african taurines  were closer to oul and aub. kur and bor individuals branched between west african taurines and zebus. to go further in the characterization of the population relationships we carried out a principal component analysis   <cit>  based on all available snp information  <cit> . as shown in figure 2a and in agreement with previous published studies  <cit> , the first component which accounted for  <dig> % of variation separated west african populations according to a zebu/taurine gradient while the second  could be associated to an africa/europe gradient, the north african oul being closer to the european aub. a similar pca performed after removing the three outgroup populations  allowed to distinguish west african populations according to the same zebu/taurine gradient on the first axis . the second and third components  separated respectively lag and nd <dig> from the other west african taurines  . the position of nd <dig> along the third axis suggested a certain level of admixture with shorthorn populations, most probably of bao origin, according to their sampling area , although pairwise fst divergence was smaller when compared to som . finally, the fourth component  separated both west-african hybrids  and zebus  . overall, these results demonstrated a clear partition of the west african populations considered. fst between pairs of populations  were all found significantly non null  and ranged between  <dig>   and  <dig>  .

as reported in table s <dig> , within population fis were almost null  for zfu and bor or very close to zero  for nd <dig>  bao, kur and zch. the slightly positive fis  observed in som might result from the sampling area being apart the border between togo and benin. the positive fis  of similar magnitude observed in lag might rather originate from a higher level of inbreeding as suggested by the extent of linkage disequilibrium  within this population . conversely, for nd <dig>  the negative fis  might be explained by recent outcrossing events. indeed nd <dig> individuals derived from founders recently collected in different and distant ivorian villages . this hypothesis is also in agreement with their higher dispersion compared to other west african taurines in the pca  and a higher level of overall extent of ld . nevertheless, the global fis coefficient remained close to zero  while the global fst and fit were respectively equal to  <dig>  and  <dig> . such a level of differentiation among the west african populations was in agreement with the one computed based on microsatellite markers  <cit>  suggesting a low impact of the snp ascertainment procedure on these estimates.

bayesian scan for differentiation among snps
we further studied the differentiation among snps and populations based on a bayesian hierarchical model derived from  <cit>  and presented in more details in the methods section. among the factors influencing population differences in allele counts , the model aims at distinguishing locus-specific from population-specific factors, such as migration or drift  <cit> . because most snps originated prior to breed differentiation, the effect of different mutation rates across loci might be negligible and the snp-specific effect in the model is mainly related to selection. notice that the model assumed the fis to be null within each population which appeared sound given the characteristics of our data . we also ignored ascertainment biases originating both from the snp discovery process and our selection of snps "informative" in west african populations. these two different sources are expected to favour polymorphic snps of ancient origin  and thus modifies to some extent the distribution of allele frequencies in the gene pool   <cit> . recently, efficient algorithms were proposed to account for ascertainment biases  <cit> , providing it can be modelled . nevertheless, for the purpose of this study we were mainly concerned with possible biases introduced in the locus-specific effect estimation which might not be of importance  <cit> . at least for our second source of ascertainment bias, simulated data allowed to confirm this statement  since estimation of x was found robust to departure from the prior distribution assumed. similarly, although more variable, locus-specific effect estimates were highly correlated with their corresponding simulated values .

to identify loci subjected to selection we thus focused on the posterior estimates of the snp effect and evaluated the significance of its departure to the null value . in figure  <dig>  we plotted the posterior snp specific fst estimate against its bayes factor  expressed in deciban units . bf compare models with and without the locus effect in terms of posterior to prior odds ratios, thus providing a basis for a decision rule to identify snps under selection . the mean  of the posterior distribution for the proportion p of snps under selection  was equal to  <dig>  . analyses of four simulated data sets  revealed that such estimates were extremely robust to the prior distribution of p . the high proportion of snps under selection confirmed that selection had a non negligible role in the differentiation of these populations.

to provide insights into the decision rule criterion  to declare snps as subjected to selection, we subsequently investigated the power and the robustness of the model using simulated data . for each of the four previously mentioned simulated data sets, we estimated false discovery rates  and false negative rate  . application of the jeffreys' rule  proved efficient since the fdr, although slightly increasing with the simulated p, was always less than  <dig> % when considering a threshold of  <dig> on bf . however, for such stringent a threshold, the fnr was very high across the four simulated data sets , a detailed inspection  showing that most non discovered snps were those with the smallest simulated effects . more precisely, for snps under positive selection, the fnr was less than 30%  when αi > <dig>  while above 98% when αi < <dig>  in addition, as expected from previous studies  <cit>  and from our overall relatively low level of differentiation, the model was less powerful to detect snps under balancing selection. the observed fnr remained high even for very large  αi . decreasing the threshold to a less stringent value such as  <dig>  reduced substantially the fnr  and increased only slightly the fdr. to illustrate how these values of αi can be related to a coefficient of selection s we finally performed simulations under a wright-fisher island model with selection for various s and types of selection  <cit> . for snps under positive selection, αi > <dig> was achieved for loci with s > <dig>   while for snps under balancing selection αi remained low even for large s  . this confirmed that given our overall level of differentiation, the approach is expected to be powerful for positively selected snps with moderate to high effect but might lack some power even for those under high balancing selection.

results are presented for four simulated data sets with a varying proportion p of loci under selection.

a genome map of regions under adaptive differentiation
whole genome maps of adaptively differentiated loci in west african populations are given in figure  <dig> for four different thresholds on bf value. in total,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  of the  <dig>  snps displayed a bf above  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . as expected  most of the snps displaying high evidence of selection were highly differentiated suggesting they were subjected to positive selection . more precisely, among the snps with a bf value above  <dig>   <dig> were under balancing selection with a fst <  <dig>  while  <dig> were clearly under positive selection with a fst >  <dig> . at a more stringent threshold on bf of  <dig>   <dig> snps remained under balancing selection  and  <dig> under positive selection . interestingly, the whole genome distribution of snps declared under selection appeared less uniform as the threshold on bf increased . this might be explained by the effect of selection which tends to increase ld between markers  <cit> . yet, we did not include in the model any spatial structure, which may take into account the ld among snps, as recently proposed ().(). <cit> . within the different west african populations and at the distance of  <dig> kb corresponding to our average marker spacing , r <dig> was close to the asymptotic value   which is related to the current effective population size  <cit> . as a result, the level of association between most snp pairs was expected to be of similar magnitude to the one between unlinked markers as illustrated by the correlations of the estimated fst and bf between pairs of snps which quickly dropped towards  <dig> as they were more distantly related .

as an attempt to identify those genomic regions with unexpectedly high proportions of selected snps, we smoothed individual snp bf values over each chromosome . this empirical, non parametric approach can efficiently combine information from several neighboring snps and allows the identification of significantly differentiated regions. this strategy might provide in turn a first empirical attempt to correct for false positives as expected when a hierarchical structure exists among populations under study i.e. when some populations share a recent ancestry or there are barriers to gene flow between some of them  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>   <dig> significant regions were identified at the 5% local fdr  threshold. in agreement with strong hitchhiking effects, these regions together contained  <dig> % of the snps with a bf larger than  <dig> and  <dig> % of the snps with a bf larger than  <dig>  in addition, most of these snps were subjected to positive selection  although a notable exception is represented by the region on the middle of bta <dig> which was exclusively composed of snps under balancing selection. interestingly, this region contains bola, the bovine major histocompatibility complex  for which balancing selection has already been extensively reported in other species  <cit>  and also in other cattle populations  <cit> . to a lesser extent, a few other regions, such as the ones localized on the centromeric part of bta <dig>  the telomeric part of bta <dig> and the middle of bta <dig>  contained a high proportion of snps under balancing selection. this might be related to the maintenance of several haplotypes containing variants under positive selection within different populations. alternatively, the fixation of the same variant in some populations could also lead to such a trend because of the low level of ld across populations  <cit> .

functional annotation of regions under selection
the  <dig>  snps were representative of about  <dig>  different genes corresponding to approximately one third of the total number expected in the genome. for each of these, table s <dig>  summarizes the number of snps they contained and results from the differentiation analysis. individual snp information made it nevertheless difficult to propose a list of genes subjected to selection and this strategy might be more sensitive to possible false positives introduced by hierarchical structure among the populations under study  <cit> . alternatively, a great proportion of such genes could include snps appearing as significantly differentiated as a result of hitchhiking with a favourable variant located nearby . hence, among the  <dig>  genes containing or close to at least one snp with a bf >  <dig> ,  <dig>  mapped within one of the  <dig> regions identified above. for functional and network analyses, we thus decided to mainly concentrate on the  <dig> genes which were located for  <dig> of them , under the peak of each region, or for the remaining  <dig> less than  <dig> kb from the peak of each region  . these  <dig> genes were viewed as the strongest candidates underlying the observed footprints of selection. among these,  <dig> genes were eligible for network analysis,  <dig> being also eligible for functional analysis. the five remaining ones  were not eligible for any network or functional analyses.

four significant networks namely n <dig>  n <dig>  n <dig> and n <dig>  were identified. three of them  were interconnected and further merged into a single network . networks n and n <dig> are represented in figure  <dig> and their functional annotations detailed in table s <dig> . the main hubs of n corresponded to genes encoding cytokines  and protein kinases . network n contained  <dig> of our candidate genes , some of them being involved in innate and adaptive immune response . network n <dig> contained molecules mainly involved in cancer, cellular function and maintenance, and neurological disease, and among them nine candidate genes . six other candidate genes  were eligible for network analysis but were included neither in n nor n <dig>  overall, the functional annotation suggested that the three main physiological functions targeted by selection in the breeds we studied were related to i) immune response, ii) nervous system and iii) skin and hair development which we discuss in the following.

immune response genes under selection
several candidate genes  belonging to n directly participate in antigen recognition, a key process underlying the development of immune response. for instance, trim <dig>  a newly identified type of igg fc receptors  <cit>  participates to both the host anti-viral response through the modulation of irf <dig> functions  <cit>  and mediation of autoimmune diseases. footprints of selection were recently reported in primates within another member of the same tripartite motif  family of proteins which has antiretroviral properties  <cit> . ticam <dig> is a toll like receptor  adapter and thus plays a role in innate immunity. it possesses, in particular, a high ifn type i inducing activity during viral infection  <cit> . dlk <dig>  a member of the epidermal growth factor-like gene family, has been shown in mouse to be involved in b lymphocytes differentiation and function  <cit> . more specifically, other genes  are related to antigen presentation to t cells in the context of mhc. although no mhc genes were present in the list analyzed, the corresponding region  and a snp  within the bovine hla-dmb ortholog  were found under strong balancing selection. among the molecules participating to antigen presentation, the chemokine receptor cxcr <dig> is co-recruited with ccr <dig> in the immunological synapse, and it participates to modulation of t cells response  <cit> . these two molecules were shown to act as co-receptors for hiv entry in human cells  <cit> . a strong signature of balancing selection was reported in the 5' cis-regulatory region of ccr <dig> in human  <cit> , this region displaying as well a selective sweep in chimpanzee  <cit> . we also recently observed a significant signal of selection on a microsatellite located less than  <dig> mb from cxcr <dig> in west african taurine  <cit>  and defining the boundary of a qtl underlying the trypanotolerance trait in cattle  <cit> . similarly, rfx <dig>  is located within another qtl identified in this latter study  <cit> . this member of the regulatory factor x  gene family participates with ciita in the regulation of mhc genes  <cit> . cd79a via cd79α-cd79β heterodimer located on the surface of b cells is required for antigen presentation through mhc class ii  <cit> . sema4a a semaphorin expressed on dendritic cells and b cells is involved in t cell priming and th <dig> differentiation through its interaction with tim <dig> expressed on t cells  <cit> .

although heat stress response may have imposed immunological parameter modifications  <cit> , infectious and parasitical diseases are likely to have represented selective pressures acting on genes involved in such functions  <cit> . as previously mentioned, trypanosomiasis represents one of the well known examples of such selective pressure. nevertheless, the importance of other diseases such as tick-borne diseases  or anthrax should not be overlooked. for instance, anthrax is hyperendemic  or endemic in west africa http://www.vetmed.lsu.edu/whocc/mp_world.htm. notice that the antrxr <dig>  a receptor of the anthrax toxin was among our candidate genes .

neural genes under selection
in addition to the exposure to new pathogens, the recent settlement of cattle to sub saharan africa might have imposed a dramatic change in their environmental conditions  <cit> . hence, cattle  were exposed to warmer temperature, to a thermal amplitude decrease, to a day length change, to differences in solar radiation and also to new feeding conditions. as a result, adaptations needed modifications in global appearance , in body temperature regulation, in circadian clock and also in reproductive behaviour and abilities. such selective pressures might partly explain the physiological functions related to nervous system . alternatively, neurotropism of several parasites such as trypanosoma have been demonstrated at least in human. some of the candidate genes related to nervous system development and function belonged to n <dig>  or n . neurod <dig> is a member of the neurogenic differentiation transcription factor family  <cit>  while olfm <dig> is a secreted glycoprotein belonging to the noelins family which modulate the timing of neuronal differentiation during development  <cit> . interestingly, magi <dig> is a scaffolding protein present in tight junction of epithelial cells  <cit> , some transcripts of the corresponding gene being only expressed in brain. moreover it is located within a qtl underlying the trypanotolerance trait  <cit> . besides their role in immune response , semaphorins represented by sema4a were initially characterized for their role in the guidance of axonal migration during neuronal development. mutations in the conserved semaphorin domain of sema4a are associated with two retinal degenerative diseases, retinis pigmentosa and cone-rod dystrophy  <cit> . of more particular interest is htr <dig> which is a serotonin receptor participating to the serotonergic system. recently, a mutation within htr2a, a receptor of the same family was reported associated with the chronic fatigue syndrome corresponding to a dysregulation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal  axis and serotonergic system  <cit> . a reduced responsiveness of the hpa axis after corticotropin-releasing hormone  challenge was observed in boran cattle infected with trypanosoma congolense  <cit> . taken together, a possible involvement of htr <dig> in trypanotolerance/susceptibility in cattle might be hypothesized though we cannot exclude an implication of this serotonin receptor in more general aspects of circadian rythmicity  <cit> .

genes under selection involved in skin and hair properties
although ednrb plays an essential role in the development of enteric neurons, it is also involved in the development of epidermal melanocytes, both cell lineages being derived from the neural crest  <cit> . as an illustration, several ednrb mutations are associated with an auditory pigmentary syndrome caused by the absence of melanocytes  <cit> . however, given the variety of cattle populations surveyed , the footprint of selection observed in the ednrb region is more likely related to differences in coat color and more particularly to the spotting pattern  or the white color . indeed, ednrb is also referred to as piebald or s locus in mouse  <cit>  and a null mutation induce a white coat color in rat  <cit> . in the hereford cattle breed, although not yet fully characterized, locus s seems responsible for white spotting pattern  <cit> . in addition to ednrb involved in skin and hair pigmentation, other genes such as trsp <dig> which belonged to n and krtap8- <dig> which was not eligible for network analysis play a role in hair development in human and mouse. indeed, trps <dig> is a zinc finger transcription factor implicated in growth and trichosis, some of its variants being associated with trichorhinophalangeal syndromes  <cit> . it is down-regulated in patients affected by hypertrichosis and in a mouse model of hypertrichosis  <cit> . krtap8- <dig>  a keratin associated protein, plays a role in the formation of hair shafts  <cit> .

the skin color and thickness, the hair size and sleekness and the number of sweat glands directly influence thermo-resistance of cattle living in the tropics  <cit> . compared to european taurine breeds, zebus which have a higher density of sweat glands and a smoother and shinier hair coat were reported to better regulate body temperature and more efficiently maintain cellular function during heat stress  <cit> . similarly, slick-haired holstein cattle are more able to regulate their body temperature than wild-type  <cit> . some skin and hair properties might also confer higher resistance to tick infestation  <cit> . interestingly, some genes involved in hair development also participate in cornification. hence the observed footprint of selection within the cluster of keratin associated proteins  might thus also be related to horn morphology differences  <cit> . a striking example is the floating horns of kur which could represent original adaptation facilitating swimming in their swamp living area  <cit> . note that the identified region is also localized less than  <dig> mb from the bovine polled locus  <cit> 

CONCLUSIONS
west african cattle provide a valuable resource to better understand the genomic response to selective pressure arising in tropical conditions. this large-scale whole genome bayesian scan for adaptive differentiation in populations representative of the current breed diversity allowed us to identify candidate genes involved in several key physiological functions. these results might open the way towards the identification of variants underlying these footprints of selection, in particular those involved in the resistance to tropical infectious diseases in cattle but also in other mammals such as human populations subjected to similar pressures.
