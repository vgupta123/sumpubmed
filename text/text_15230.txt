BACKGROUND
small-cell lung cancer  represent up to  <dig> % of lung cancers and pose a major challenge as we are unable to diagnose it early, its most aggressive clinical behavior and the lack of lasting benefit from therapy. patients presenting with this neuroendocrine tumor of the lung have a dismal 5% 5-year survival rate. although sclc is highly sensitive to chemotherapy and radiation, it invariably recurs with fatal widespread metastasis  <cit> . in contrast to non-small cell lung cancer , to date no specific genetic biomarkers or molecular subtypes have been identified in sclc  <cit> . gene expression profiling has had limited success in sclc stratification for the purpose of personalized treatment. although recent advances in genomic analysis of sclc have identified potential driver mutations in sclc  <cit> , there remains an unmet need for approaches that can stratify sclc patients and/or uncover viable molecular targets in sclc.

to meet this challenge, we turned to weighted gene co-expression gene network analysis , a recently introduced bioinformatics method that captures complex relationships between genes and phenotypes. the distinct advantage over other methods, such as differential gene expression, is that wgcna transforms gene expression data into functional modules of co-expressed genes without any prior assumptions about genes/phenotypes, providing insights into signaling networks that may be responsible for phenotypic traits of interest  <cit> . in lung cancer, its potential remains unexplored.

our wgcna analysis of a public lung tumor dataset  <cit>  revealed a module of co-expressed genes specific to sclc. after filtering, the sclc-specific module was reduced to a sclc-specific hub network  signature that classified sclc from other lung cancer types in several public and in-house tumor datasets , and in lung cancer cell lines. sshn was enriched for hubs in signaling networks known to be associated with sclc pathogenesis, including cell cycle, oxidative stress response and dna damage response. as a proof of concept, we chose to validate oncogenic kinase hubs  within sshn, as they provide special translational relevance as potential candidates for targeted therapy and also play key roles in various hallmarks of cancer. among the twenty, spleen tyrosine kinase , a previously undescribed target in sclc, exhibited one of the highest overall statistical associations with the sclc phenotype, based on wgcna gene significance  and overexpression in shotgun proteomics, and was therefore selected for further validation as a target.

syk has been previously investigated most extensively in the context of lymphocyte development and as a therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies. syk activation leads to several downstream events that promote cell survival, including activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  and akt, and the phosphorylation of multiple signaling proteins  <cit> . in b-cells, it transduces tonic signaling by physical interaction with the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif  of the b-cell antigen receptor  complex  <cit> , positively regulating survival and proliferation during development and immune response. syk is also associated with the fc receptor in b-cells, which instead has opposite effects to the bcr  <cit> . the balance of regulation on survival and proliferation downstream of syk is influenced by redox signaling: nadph oxidase, in close proximity to bcr, can produce peroxide that inhibits phosphatase action on bcr-activated syk, reinforcing tonic signaling  <cit> . another important function of syk is response to oxidative stress where syk gets activated and promotes pro-survival pathways  <cit> . b-cells die in response to syk knock-down and fail to develop in syk-deficient mice  <cit> . together, these observations have formed a rationale for syk-targeted therapy in hematological malignancies with small molecule kinase inhibitors  <cit> . syk has not been studied in the context of lung neuroendocrine  cells, the sclc cells of origin, whose oxygen sensing functions, in analogy with bcr, rely on redox signaling  <cit> .

to our knowledge, syk has not been proposed before as an oncogenic driver or candidate target in sclc. based on our wgcna results, we investigated this possibility. we determined that  <dig> out of  <dig> sclcs were syk-positive by immunostaining in patient tissue microarrays . moreover, syk knock-down reduced proliferation and survival in syk-positive sclc lines. we propose that syk is an oncogenic driver in sclc and that syk expression may be developed as a companion biomarker for syk targeted therapy.

RESULTS
identification of a sclc-specific co-expression module
to identify a hierarchical network view of co-expressed genes across lung cancer subtypes, we applied wgcna to a public dataset  comprised of  <dig> normal,  <dig> adenocarcinoma ,  <dig> squamous cell carcinoma  and  <dig> sclc lung cancer tissue specimens  <cit> . an unsupervised correlation similarity matrix was built based on pairwise correlations between genes. unsupervised average linkage hierarchical clustering of all genes in this dataset resulted into  <dig> modules  labeled by color and each comprised of mutually exclusive co-expressed genes. genes with no distinct module assignment are grouped in a grey module by wgcna. none of these modules were identified using any pre-assigned phenotype or gene bias. to ensure that modules were not being detected by chance, we simulated a random dataset containing same number of samples and genes as our test dataset. only two modules were generated from the random dataset, turquoise and grey , indicating that wgcna module identification in our test dataset is in fact driven by meaningful gene co-expression patterns .

following the unsupervised module generation, individual gene correlations to a specific phenotype  were quantified by gene significance . the average gs of all genes within each module is summarized in figure 1b. this analysis unveiled positive or negative correlation of certain modules with specific lung cancer subtypes, or normal lung. the brown and purple modules appeared to be adc specific, and included previously identified adc markers cytochrome b <dig>  or surfactant protein b, c and d , respectively <cit> . yellow, pink, orange and light cyan modules were scc specific and included involvulin , cytokeratin  <dig> , and galectin- <dig>   <cit>  . the green module contained genes positively correlated to the normal lung phenotype and negatively correlated with all tumor subtypes , making it a "normal lung module" .

the blue module was specific to sclc . accordingly, it contained genes that have already been associated with sclc progression such as achaete-scute complex homolog  <dig> , neural cell adhesion molecule  <dig> , thyroid transcription factor- <dig>  and insulinoma associated- <dig>   <cit>  .

identification and validation of a sclc-specific hub network  of co-expressed genes across genomic and proteomic platforms
to identify and validate a network of co-expressed genes that is specific to sclc, we focused on the blue module. the sclc-specific blue module  is comprised of co-expressed up-regulated genes across sclc tumors. each module is arranged in the form of a hierarchical network . therefore, each module consists of a few highly connected "hubs"  as well as many genes with fewer connections. the rationale behind building hub-based networks is to narrow down the list of relevant candidates, based on the assumption that highly connected hubs are more vulnerable targets to alter network performance. this assumption has been successful in several examples from biological networks in yeast  <cit>  and mammalian cells, including cancer  <cit> .

each module can be further filtered to identify the top hubs relative to desired criteria using measures such as intramodular connectivity  and gene significance   <cit> . we filtered the blue module genes to obtain hubs that ranked high in each of the following criteria: a) high positive correlation with sclc phenotype given by gene significance ; b) high intramodular connectivity ; and c) high t-test statistic  and a p-value less than  <dig> . this filtering approach produced  <dig> hub genes, which are not only overexpressed in sclc, but also highly connected within sclc. we refer to this network of  <dig> hubs as sclc-specific hub network  .

to validate the robustness of sshn as a sclc-specific classifier, it was first applied by unsupervised hierarchical clustering bootstrap analysis to patient samples in a test public dataset  from which the blue module was derived. the sshn classified sclc away from every other lung tumor subtype  and normal lung, the area under roc curve  was  <dig>  with 95% confidence interval  of  . the performance of the sshn classifier was reproducible in both an independent validation patient dataset of  <dig> tumors   <cit>  generated in a different array platform   , as well as in our own microarray dataset containing  <dig> scc and  <dig> sclc samples . in the gse <dig> dataset, the sshn also proved to be an excellent classifier for distinguishing sclc from large cell carcinoma  subtype . interestingly, large cell neuroendocrine carcinomas , another high-grade neuroendocrine tumor  of the lung, co-clustered with sclc, confirming similarities between the  <dig> tumor types as reported previously  <cit> . on all the three patient datasets, the sshn genes are highly predictive of sclc against other tissue types with statistically significant p-values less than  <dig> .

to further validate the sshn as a classifier, we used next-generation sequencing to produce genome-wide rna-seq data on an independent set of tissues including  <dig> sclcs,  <dig> sccs, and  <dig> normal lung tissue specimens. we detected overexpression of  <dig> genes out of  <dig> sshn genes that differentiate sclc  from normal lung alone  while  <dig> genes out of  <dig> sshn genes differentiate sclc  from normal lung and sqcc  , indicating that sshn is a robust classifier in another data type .

finally, the sshn gene expression classifier was further validated at the protein level in yet another in-house, independent set of formalin fixed paraffin embedded patient tissue samples analyzed by shotgun proteomics and comprised of  <dig> samples each of sclc, scc, adc and age- and smoking history-matched normal lung tissues specimens, pooled by histologic type. out of  <dig> sshn genes,  <dig> gene products were detected at the proteomic level and also classified the sclcs apart from the other tissues . to our knowledge, this is a first report of an entire sclc genomic signature validated at the proteomic level.

in each of the  <dig> datasets, there were 1- <dig> specimens that did not segregate with the sshn-defined sclc cluster, but were clinically diagnosed as sclc . this could be due to mis-diagnosis as is fairly common in sclc due to mixed sclc-nsclc histology  <cit> , or possibly a small subset of patients whose tumors have different biology. overall, we conclude that the sshn is a robust molecular classifier to distinguish sclc from other lung tumor types and normal lung across multiple gene and protein expression platforms.

biological insights from the sshn: network enrichment analysis and target identification
to gain biological insights in sclc biology, the sshn component genes were further categorized into functional pathways based on the assumption that they are co-upregulated because of shared cellular functions. analysis of sshn by webgestalt  <cit>  revealed that sshn is enriched for functional pathways summarized in additional files  <dig> and  <dig> and figure s <dig> in additional file  <dig>  and include cell cycle and checkpoint response , cellular stress response , and dna damage response and repair pathways. all p-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons in webgestalt and therefore effectively rank the significance of these functional pathways in sclc phenotype.

as a proof-of-concept that connected hubs identified by wgcna are of biological relevance, we further refined the pathway analysis by focusing on kinases, since these tend to be of the greatest translational value. there were  <dig> kinases contained in the sshn , all worth investigating in the context of sclc. however, shotgun proteomics data  indicated that syk is strongly overexpressed within the sclc phenotype compared to normal tissue . syk is an oncogenic non-receptor tyrosine kinase involved in hematologic malignancies  <cit> . another oncogene, the src-family kinase fyn, was also part of this sshn kinase set. syk is an intracellular signal transducer downstream of growth factor/t-cell/b-cell receptors well known to work in concert with src-family kinases  <cit> . specific overexpression of syk and fyn in sclc, compared to other lung tumor types, has not been previously reported, to the best of our knowledge . together, these clues prompted us to select syk and fyn for further investigation in the context of sclc tumors.

to verify co-expression at the protein level, we immunostained for syk and fyn in a panel of sclcs assembled in tissue microarrays . all specimens were tested in duplicate, and the expression of syk and fyn consistently co-varied , with a correlation of  <dig>  across sclc specimens. clustering analysis of the staining scores of syk/fyn expression separated the tma specimens into  <dig> groups, syk/fyn-positive and -negative tumors .

preservation of sshn and differential syk/fyn expression in sclc cell lines
syk and fyn are attractive candidates for targeted therapy  <cit> . to test their functional relevance in sclc, we turned to sclc cultured cell lines. the sshn classifier was conserved in a large panel of lung cell lines  <cit> . as indicated by clustering analysis ,  <dig> out of  <dig> sclc cell lines separated nicely from the other  <dig> lung cancer cell lines tested . note that  <dig> sclc cell lines did not follow this pattern, an observation mirrored in tumor specimens  that warrants further studies.

we investigated co-expression of syk and fyn in sclc cell lines by western blotting of whole-cell lysates with appropriate antibodies . similar to our protein expression shown by immunostaining of our tmas, syk and fyn exhibited a trend to co-vary in sclc cell lines , opening an avenue to biochemical analyses of the functional value of this differential expression. note that syk has two splice-variant isoforms - long  and short  that lacks  <dig> amino acids  <cit> . the syk positive cell lines overexpress syk  form while other cell lines express low or no syk  .

inhibiting sclc cell line viability by syk knock-down
to assess the validity of syk and/or fyn as targets in sclc, we down-regulated the expression of these proteins using sirna in the h <dig> and h <dig> cell lines . sirna induced 80- <dig> percent reduction in total protein expression for each of these molecules in both h <dig> and h <dig> . we assessed viability with automated microscopy, imaging-based methods . syk knock-down caused a significant decrease in proliferation rates compared to scrambled control in both h <dig> and h <dig> , while fyn knock-down showed little effect . the decrease in proliferation was in part due to a loss of cell viability, as indicated by increased cell death by day  <dig> in syk knock-down cells assessed by ethidium homodimer positivity . together, these data suggest that syk is a candidate therapeutic in syk/fyn-expressing sclcs.

discussion
we report several findings of immediate translational value for sclc: 1) derivation of an sclc-specific hub network  that classifies sclc from other lung cancers, including the closely related neuroendocrine tumors; 2) validation of the sshn classifier across many data types, including expression microarrays from multiple platforms, rnaseq and shotgun proteomics; 3) co-varied expression of  <dig> oncogenes, syk and fyn, in a subset of sclc tumors and cell lines; and 4) identification of syk as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for sclc.

the increasing availability of large gene expression cancer datasets presents unprecedented opportunities for translational advances. challenges in data analytics, however, must be met. for instance, the predominant metric of differential gene expression is silent on disease relevance of identified gene products, since it provides no measure of their functional relatedness  <cit> , and its resulting signatures do not replicate well across datasets  <cit> . the number of potential therapeutic targets  is large and expanding, but target prioritization is hampered by lack of functional insight. in contrast, analyses based on gene co-expression algorithms perform well across data types  <cit>  and inspire working hypotheses since their results resemble hierarchical signaling networks. accordingly, the sclc-specific co-expressed gene classifier network sshn we report here is robust across datasets encompassing different types of lung cancer . in particular, despite being derived from gene expression microarray data, the sshn performed well on proteomic lung cancer specimens. note that each of the datasets tested were obtained from independent sclc patient cohorts. to our knowledge, this is the first report of signature preservation on a shotgun proteomic sclc dataset. other co-expression based approaches have also been successfully applied in other cancers such as breast cancer  <cit> .

neuroendocrine lung tumors, to which sclc belong, are sometimes difficult to sort out based solely on the current world health organization  criteria of morphology and mitotic rate, warranting searches for additional biomarkers  <cit> . the sshn signature begins to address this need, e.g., distinguishing sclc that stain negative for neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin a   <cit>  from nsclc, and mixed sclc-nsclc from nsclc. however, because of the very small number of lcnec samples studied by gene expression analysis, we cannot exclude the possibility that other lcnec tumors would co-cluster with sclc. in addition, due to the lack of larger sclc datasets and the limited clinical information on the available sclc datasets, careful validation of our results, including outcome associations, is definitely warranted.

while sshn as a whole is an effective sclc classifier, its individual component genes  may or may not be expressed in a particular tumor. this is not at all surprising, due to the expected inter-tumor heterogeneity within a particular histological type  <cit> . our data suggest that within the sclc cluster defined by sshn, a further subdivision between syk/fyn-positive and -negative may be informative. a few specimens classified as sclc by pathological and clinical criteria, did not cluster with sshn-defined sclc . whether these are misdiagnosed or represent disease heterogeneity or different stage of tumor progression remains to be tested.

receptor and non-receptor tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases are effective actionable targets in cancer. sshn contains twenty kinases and growth factor receptors, including ttk, tlk <dig>  nek <dig>  cdk <dig>  fyn, plcg <dig>  syk . none of these were previously reported in sclc; thus, prioritization strategies are called for. the kinases syk and fyn stand out as potential sclc targets for several reasons. besides being tightly associated with the sclc phenotype, they are already proven as candidate targets in other cancers, such as cml  <cit> , aml  <cit> , retinoblastoma  <cit> , glioblastoma  <cit>  and prostate cancer  <cit> . they also activate focal adhesion kinase   <cit> , previously shown by our group to be amplified, overexpressed and constitutively activated in sclc  <cit> . they play key roles in anchorage independence, survival and oxidative stress response by activating multiple downstream pathways including akt and erk kinases  <cit> .

we found that syk knock-down significantly decreased viability and growth rates in syk/fyn-positive sclc via increased cell death , suggesting that syk plays an oncogenic driver role and that inhibitors could potentially be used in syk-positive sclc, alone or in combination with chemotherapy. increased cell death was also observed in aml via knock-down of syk  <cit> . further studies are needed to discriminate between overexpression versus activation of syk in sclc.

our findings unveil an unsuspected link between sclc and the biology of b-cell leukemias/lymphomas that is worth exploring. the role of syk in b-cell receptor  initiated tonic signaling both in normal b-cells and lymphomas is well established  <cit> . tonic signaling promotes proliferation and survival of b-cells. mice lacking syk exhibit profound b-cell development deficits, and die embryonically from severe hemorrhages, also pointing to indispensable syk signaling in cell types other than b-cells  <cit> . targeted syk therapy has been advocated in various types of b-cell lymphomas, and specific inhibitors for its kinase activity are already approved such as r <dig>  fostamatinib  <cit> , opening avenues for testing targeted treatment in sclc. syk signaling in ne  may be associated with oxygen sensing  <cit> , but syk-associated receptor in ne or sclc cells remain to be defined.

there are several reports of tumor suppressor functions for syk in several solid tumor types, including breast cancer  <cit> , gastric cancer, and melanoma  <cit> . additional data are needed to reconcile these seemingly conflicting roles of syk as oncogene or tumor suppressor. in this regard, it is worth noting that in b-cells effects of syk on survival and proliferation are modulated by associated src-family kinase members  <cit> . differential interactions of syk with such kinases in a tumor-specific manner are a possible explanation for the dual role of syk as a tumor suppressor in some cancers  <cit> , and an oncogene in hematologic malignancies  <cit>  and sclc. therefore, an immediate priority is to determine the type of receptor syk is associated with in sclc, and its possible regulation by src-family kinases such as fyn .

in agreement with our results, in the cancer cell line encyclopedia  <cit> ,  <dig> out of  <dig> sclc cell lines tested overexpress syk . in another recent large dataset  <dig> of  <dig> sclc cell lines overexpress syk  <cit> . we confined our experimentation to sclc cultured cell lines and knock-down of syk expression. while our data are encouraging, future studies should address applicability to spontaneous  <cit>  or human xenotransplant mouse models of sclc  <cit> . furthermore, it remains to be seen whether inhibition of syk-kinase activity, in addition to expression, elicits a death response in sclc.

it is worth noting that to date no syk mutations have been reported in any tumor type. syk gene fusions or translocations have been reported in hematologic malignancies, in which a driver function for overexpressed syk has also been postulated  <cit> . on the other hand, syk negative tumors have hypermethylation and loss of function of the syk gene  <cit> . thus, the biology of syk-positive sclc tumors may be potentially distinct from syk-negative sclc tumors, with differences due to stages of progression, or divergence of transforming mechanisms.

syk signaling functions are mediated in concert with src-family kinases  <cit> . this subject is not fully understood and, in particular it is not clear to what extent various src-family kinases are interchangeable in this role within a given cell type. it is perhaps not coincidental that a src-family kinase, fyn, was identified in the blue module by wgcna and that a strong co-expression correlation was found in sclc tmas and cell lines . byers.et.al also reported activation of src-family kinases in sclc assessed via reverse phase protein arrays   <cit> . on the other hand, fyn kinase inhibition had no effect on sclc cell line survival . clarifying the syk-fyn signaling connection in sclc, and the possible redundancy of src-family kinases may open avenues to productively deploy inhibitory combination of syk and fyn targeted therapy.

in the tma patient dataset, we detected  <dig> groups of sclc based on syk/fyn expression alone . admittedly, this dataset is too small to reach conclusions, highlighting the need for larger patient populations. nonetheless, our observations raise the possibility of distinct treatment strategies in syk-positive sclc tumors, by analogy to lung tumors overexpressing egfr, or her2+ breast cancers, whose response to targeted therapy dramatically improves the outcome  <cit> .

here we have implemented an alternative strategy to large scale sequencing, based on a systems view of signaling networks provided by gene co-expression analysis. we respectfully submit that this approach can provide useful translational insights in the biology of specific cancer types.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a robust co-expression network based signature  for sclc tumors on three independent platforms . this signature was also conserved in sclc cell lines. within this sshn network, we found twenty targetable kinases that were overexpressed in most, if not all of these platforms. two tyrosine kinases syk and fyn were overexpressed significantly in sclc patients and cell lines by several independent bioinformatics and experimental methods, and distinguished between two potential groups of patients - syk/fyn positive and negative. the syk/fyn positive sclc cell lines exhibited significant loss of viability and increased cell death in response to syk sirna, providing evidence for syk as a novel oncogenic driver for sclc. all sclc patients get treated with combination chemotherapy  without distinction. our work suggests that stratifying patients with respect to syk/fyn expression may open avenues to personalized medicine in sclc, given that syk small-molecule inhibitors are already in clinical trials for other disease conditions. future work will have to determine whether in fact syk may represent a potential actionable target in sclc, by itself or in combination with chemo or radiation therapy.
