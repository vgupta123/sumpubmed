BACKGROUND
cancer cells must acquire survival advantages including growth signaling autonomy, apoptosis resistance, sustaining of angiogenesis under stress conditions such as nutrient and oxygen deprivation to successfully survive in tumor microenvironment  <cit> . although these complicated processes involves regulation of survival related gene expression both at the transcription and translational level, recent evidence suggest that translation initiation is a primary check point that regulates cancer related mrnas  <cit> . one of the major mechanisms that cancer cells maintain higher efficiency of translation initiation involves stimulation of translation initiation factor, eif4e  <cit> .

eif4e is the rate limiting factor responsible for delivering cellular mrnas to eif4f complex  through interaction with the 5’-terminal  cap structure of mrnas  <cit> . most of the cancer related mrnas have the highly complex and lengthy 5’ untranslated region, which leads to the low translation initiation efficiency  <cit> . therefore, either level or activity of eif4e needs to be up regulated to maintain active translation of these weak mrnas. one way to enhance eif4e activity is through pi3-k/akt dependent signaling cascade that activates mtor kinase  <cit> . activated mtor phosphorylates and inactivates eif4e-binding protein 4e-bp  <cit> . upon phosphorylation of 4e-bp, eif4e is released from 4e-bp and bind to eif4g to form eif4f complex which mediates translation initiation  <cit> . aggressive cancer cells often take advantage of mitogenic signaling pathways to activate mtor and free up eif4e to maintain their survival and growth  <cit> .

our previous studies demonstrated that α6β <dig> integrin stimulates eif4e activity to promote translation of survival factor, vegf via akt/mtor pathway in breast carcinoma cells under serum deprivation condition  <cit> . while α6β4-dependent translation control via atk/mtor pathway has been established, the early signaling event to link between α6β <dig> and mtor is not well characterized. one of the prime candidates that mediate α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation is src as it is a key immediate early downstream effector of α6β <dig> and its activity is required for α6β <dig> signaling competency  <cit> . src is an intracellular non-receptor tyrosine kinase which has been implicated in proliferation, metastasis and invasion of various human cancers  <cit> . for example, oestrogen induced c-src activation leads to 4e-bp phoshorylation through pi3k/mtor pathway and consequently promotes translation of hif- <dig> α in breast cancer cells  <cit> . another study showed that active c-src up-regulates translation of β-catenin by activation of eif4e via ras/erk pathway and the phosphorylation of 4e-bp via the pi3k/mtor pathways  <cit>  based on these evidences that c-src stimulate translational initiation via mtor signaling, we hypothesized that c-src mediates α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation and subsequent assembly of eif4e machinery to enhance cap-dependent translation of weak mrnas.

in this study, we assessed the role of c-src in α6β <dig> dependent translational control. pharmacologic inhibition of c-src as well as knockdown of its expression by shrna showed that c-src plays an essential role in mediating α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation in mda-mb-435/β <dig> and mda-mb- <dig> cancer cells. src is also required to form eif4f complex and enhance cap-dependent translation of vegf mrna. these results suggest that c-src is an important immediate early signaling molecule to connect α6β <dig> signaling to mtor, which eventually contribute to translation of survival factors such as vegf.

RESULTS
src activity is required for α6β <dig> dependent mtor phosphorylation
α6β <dig> plays a pivotal role in controlling translation through mtor signaling  <cit> , but the immediate early signaling events that link α6β <dig> to mtor activation remains to be defined. based on recent reports that c-src is involved in translation initiation through akt/mtor signaling in human cancer cells  <cit> , we hypothesized that c-src is a major mediator for α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation. to test this hypothesis, we first assessed the relationship between α6β <dig> expression and src activity. we stably knocked down β <dig> integrin expression in mda-mb- <dig> using lentivirus shrna. mda-mb- <dig> cells, which endogenously lack β <dig> expression, were stably transfected with either β <dig> integrin or mock vector . as reported previously by our studies and others  <cit> , the reduction of β <dig> integrin expression by β <dig> shrna in mda-mb- <dig> cells effectively blocked src phosphorylation at y <dig>  and β <dig> phosphorylation at y <dig>  . the exogenous β <dig> integrin expression in mda-mb- <dig> cells  significantly increased the src phosphorylation at y <dig> . we then tested the role of src in α6β <dig> dependent mtor phosphorylation. pharmacologic inhibition of src activity by pp <dig> effectively decreased phosphorylation level of mtor at ser <dig>  in mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435/β <dig> cells . to further confirm the role of src in α6β <dig> dependent mtor phosphorylation, we knocked down expression of c-src using shrna in mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435/β <dig> cells. knockdown of c-src expression significantly reduces the level of phosphorylated mtor at s <dig> too . we were not able to detect a significant change of the total protein level of mtor by inhibition of src by pp <dig> or shrna. these data suggest that α6β <dig> dependent c-src activation leads to the phosphorylation of mtor.

c-src contributes to α6β <dig> dependent torc <dig> and torc <dig> activation
mammalian target of rapamycin  exists in two functionally and structurally distinct complexes, torc <dig> and torc <dig>  <cit> . the primary function of torc <dig> is to regulate translation initiation through the phosphorylation of s6k and 4ebp <dig>  whereas the primary function of torc <dig> is to regulate survival and proliferation by activation of the kinases such as akt and sgk  <cit> . to assess relative contribution of c-src in torc <dig> vs. torc <dig> activation, we tested the effects of c-src inhibition on α6β <dig> dependent akt phosphorylation at ser  <dig>  and phosphosrylation of s <dig> ribosomal protein at ser235/ <dig> and 4e-bp <dig> at ser <dig>  in mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435/β <dig> cells. inhibition of c-src activity by pp <dig>  as well as c-src expression by shrna  effectively reduced the level of phosphorylated akt , s <dig> ribosomal protein  and 4e-bp <dig> . these results suggest that c-src mediates α6β <dig> dependent torc <dig> and torc <dig> activation.

inhibition of c-src blocks α6β <dig> dependent translation of vegf mrna
we then assessed the effects of c-src inhibition on the efficiency of overall translation initiation in mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435/β <dig> cells by performing polysome analysis . the mrna was isolated from these cells in the presence of either dmso or pp <dig>  and then fractionated on a sucrose gradient. as shown in figure  <dig>  the polysome analysis separates untranslated complex , light polysomes  and heave polysomes . our previous studies demonstrated that expression of β <dig> integrin increases the pool of heavy polysomes in these cells  <cit> . the inhibition of src activity by pp <dig> dramatically reduced the amount of heavy polysomes , suggesting that src is required for α6β <dig> dependent translation initiation. next, we tested the role of src in α6β <dig> dependent vegf translation. the relative amount of vegf mrna in each polysomal fraction was analyzed by qrt-pcr. in the mda-mb- <dig> and mda-mb-435/β <dig> , vegf mrna is distributed mostly in the polysomal region . both pp <dig> inhibition of src activity  and c-src knockdown by shrna  effectively shifted the distribution of vegf mrna to untranslated complexes . this result indicates that c-src inhibition affects cap dependent translation initiation of weak mrnas such as vegf.

inhibition of src prevents assembly of eif4f complexes
since cap-dependent translational efficiency of weak mrnas such as vegf is determined by activity of eif4e and the eif4f complexes, we examined the role of c-src in eif4e-binding to eif4f components such as eif4e and eif4g. we performed m7gtp-sepharose pull down assay in mda-mb-435/β <dig> cells to test whether src inhibition modulates the interaction of eif4e with eif4g  or 4e-bp <dig> . the inhibition of src by pp <dig>  and c-src knockdown by shrna  effectively decreased the levels of eif4g binding to m7gtp, whereas the binding level of 4e-bp <dig> to eif4e is increased. these data suggests that the inhibition of src disrupts the assembly of eif4f complex by inducing the binding of 4e-bp <dig> to eif4e, and by disassociating eif4g from eif4e.

discussion
a number of studies demonstrated the role of integrins in translation of survival and growth factors through enhancing eif4e function  <cit> , but the exact mechanism by which integrins control translation initiation of cancer related mrnas remains to be determined. in the previous study, we showed that α6β <dig> integrin promotes the translation of vegf mrna through the akt/mtor/eif4e signaling axis  <cit> . in the current studies, we investigated the role of c-src as an immediate early signaling effector that mediates α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation. we provided evidence that c-src inhibition by pp <dig> or shrna blocks mtor pathway and the subsequent assembly of eif4f complexes. this is first report to define the early signaling event that link between α6β <dig> and mtor pathway.

our studies indicated that c-src is one of early α6β <dig> signaling effectors that mediate mtor activation. as c-src represents one isoform of src family kinases , it is possible that other isoform of sfks could play a role in α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation. this is more likely due to the previous report that fyn becomes activated to mediate α6β <dig> dependent pro-invasive migration of breast carcinoma cells  <cit> . α6β <dig> dependent fyn activation requires the recruitment of shp <dig> to the phosphorylated cytoplasmic domain of integrin β <dig>  <cit> . it remains to be seen whether α6β <dig> dependent c-src activation also requires the involvement of shp <dig>  another possibility is the involvement of focal adhesion kinase  in c-src activation. fak was shown to be activated by α6β <dig>  <cit>  and fak mediates src activation in integrin signaling such as α5β <dig> or α4β <dig>  <cit> . if we establish the mechanism by which a6b <dig> activates multiple isoforms of sfks including fyn and c-src, we may need to perform sequential knockdown of each sfk isoform expression by shrnas to test the role of other sfks in mtor activation. the assays will test whether multiple sfk isoform synergistically contribute to α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation, or the loss of one sfk isoform could simply be compensated by others.

while our current studies mostly focused on translation initiation aspects of mtor signaling , torc <dig> pathway is likely activated by α6β4/c-src signaling axis . enhancement of eif-4e function by α6β <dig> is known to be mediated by torc <dig> pathway as we previously showed that torc <dig> specific inhibitor, rapamycin blocked α6β <dig> dependent eif-4e activation  <cit> . it remains to be determined how torc <dig> signaling pathway contributes to α6β <dig> dependent phenotypes of breast carcinoma cells such proliferation, survival, cell motility and invasion. knockdown of torc <dig> specific components such as rictor or sin <dig>  <cit>  will address this issue.

it is currently unknown how activated c-src by α6β <dig> mediates downstream signaling events leading to mtor activation. both akt and mapk seem to be prime candidates in mediating c-src dependent mtor activation as both involves 4e-bp <dig> phosphorylation, which is a key event for mtor activation  <cit> . activated src was shown to mediate both akt  <cit>  and mapk  <cit> . alternatively, c-src could enhance the functional crosstalk between α6β <dig> and growth factor receptors such as egfr and c-met  <cit>  and this interaction was shown to enhance both akt  <cit>  and mapk signaling  <cit> . all these evidences suggest that c-src could be an important therapeutic target that could affect growth factor receptor signaling as well as downstream events such as mtor signaling. considering that the role of α6β <dig> in breast carcinoma progression is well established, but no therapeutic agent against α6β <dig> is available yet, targeting src activity will merit consideration against tumors that express high levels of α6β <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we defined that c-src is an immediate early signaling molecule that connects α6β <dig> to mtor signaling axis. c-src mediates α6β <dig> dependent mtor activation and subsequent enhancement of cap-dependent translation of weak mrnas such as vegf. our finding suggests that c-src could be an important target of therapy for tumors that express high levels of α6β <dig>
