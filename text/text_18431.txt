BACKGROUND
trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide in which the two glucose units are linked in α-α- <dig>  1-glycosidic linkage. it is widely distributed in nature and mainly isolated from bacteria, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and plants  <cit> . in living cells trehalose acts as a carbon source  <cit> , a signal molecule  <cit> , an essential component of cell wall  <cit> . it also protects the membranes under stress conditions  <cit> .

in the present work, zunongwangia sp., a marine bacterium, which survives under high hydrostatic pressure and a low temperatures environment was explored for trehalase production  <cit> . in zunongwangia sp. trehalose is not only a source of energy but also associated with high salt-tolerance and cold adaptation  <cit> . α, α-trehalases  are the enzymes that specifically hydrolyze trehalose to glucose.

based on the amino acid sequence of known and hypothetical proteins, α, α-trehalases are classified into three glycoside hydrolase  families  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . these families belong to the clan gh-l or gh-g, but share the same classic  <dig> barrel fold, and an inverted reaction mechanism  <cit> . a previous study showed that over-expression of plant trehalase in arabidopsis decreased the trehalose levels to recover from drought stress  <cit> . in another study, trehalose accumulation was reported to have toxic effect in cuscuta reflexa  <cit> , suggesting that the transfer of trehalase gene into plants will contribute to protect the plants under such conditions. trehalase deficiency is a metabolic disorder in which human body is not able to convert trehalose into glucose  <cit> . individuals suffering from this deficiency experience vomit, abdominal discomfort and diarrhea after consumption of trehalose rich food  <cit> . these reports indicated that trehalase is both a therapeutic enzyme and potential food additive.

in  <dig>  the three-dimensional structure of periplasmic trehalase  from e. coli was explored  <cit> . silva et al. first provided the evidence  that trehalase from spodoptera frugiperda, a member of gh family  <dig>  has an aspartate residue  and a glutamate residue  as the general acid and base catalysts, respectively  <cit> . error-prone-pcr and site-directed mutagenesis are commonly used to generate a large mutant library with modified sequences and to examine the role of specific residues in enzyme activity  <cit> .

to date, to the best of our knowledge, only silva et al.  <cit>  have reported the mutants of trehalase from spodoptera frugiperda and determined the active site. the objectives of present study were to characterize a novel trehalase  from zunongwangia sp. and to improve its activity by directed evolution.

RESULTS
characteristics of trez gene, trez and mutants
a novel gene trez  was successfully cloned from zunongwangia sp. the open reading frame encoded a protein  with a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and an isoelectric point  of  <dig> . the sequence alignment indicated that trez showed high homology to trez from gh <dig> family and shared 62 % identity with a trez from gillisia sp. jm <dig> , 44 % identity with tre <dig> from e. coli  and 31 % identity with sftre <dig> from spodoptera frugiperda .fig.  <dig> amino acid sequence alignment of trez with other characterized trehalases. trez, trez investigated in this study; tre <dig>  trehalase from e.coli ; sftre <dig>  trehalase from spodoptera frugiperda . the two red rectangular boxes signature  <dig> and signature  <dig> represent two highly conserved sequence segments which belonging to gh <dig> family. asterisks indicate the catalytic sites of asp <dig> and glu494




the screening of mutant library was performed by a high-throughput screening. a mutant c <dig>  exhibiting higher catalytic efficiency than the wild type, was selected from  <dig> clones. sequence analysis revealed that c <dig> was mutated at two sites . to explore the effect of the single site on the catalytic activity of variant c <dig>  two single site mutants y227h and r442g were constructed and analyzed separately. the results showed that the purified proteins of trez and mutants had an identical molecular weight of ~ <dig>  kda . the optimal temperature for trez and mutants was 50 °c . trez, c <dig>  y227h and r442g retained more than 50 % of their original activities in the temperature range of  <dig> to 60 °c. moreover, trez was stable after 1 h incubation below 40 °c, but it lost 90 % of its original activity at  <dig> and 50 °c. the mutant c <dig>  y227h, and r442g also showed a similar trend in thermo-stability . trez, c <dig>  y227h, and r442g showed the optimal activity at ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . trez and mutants retained more than 60 % of the original activity in a ph range of  <dig> – <dig> .fig.  <dig> effects of ph and temperature on enzyme activity and stability. a effect of temperature on the activity of trez and mutants. the maximal activity was taken as 100 %. b effect of temperature on the stability of trez and mutants. the enzyme activity without pre-treatment was taken as 100 %. c effect of ph on the activity of trez and mutants. the maximal activity was taken as 100 %. black line represents wt , red line represents c <dig>  green line represents y227h and grey line represents r442g

the activity of trez increased significantly to 136 % at 1 m nacl, and more than 100 % of its original activity was retained at  <dig> – <dig>  m nacl, and 55 % of its original activity was maintained at 5 m nacl . furthermore, trez was very stable under high salt conditions, and showed no considerable loss in activity even after 24 h incubation in  <dig> –4 m nacl.fig.  <dig> effects of nacl on enzyme activity  and stability . enzyme activity was measured in 50 mm tris–hcl buffer  containing different concentrations of nacl  at 50 °c, with reaction mixture containing no nacl as 100 %. the stability assay was conducted after 24 h incubation of enzyme in 0–4 m nacl. the activity without incubation was taken as control



substrate docking analysis of trez and mutants
the models of trez and mutant enzymes were constructed based on the structure of trehalase from e. coli  with a  <dig>  % sequence identity  <cit> . as expected, the structure of the wild-type enzyme with a classical   <dig> barrel fold and two catalytic residues  were located in the inner surfaces of the central cavity . to identify the possible molecular basis for the enhancement of catalytic efficiency, we constructed a docking model of the y227h and r442g-trehalose complex based on the homology model . the substrate docking analysis indicated that the residue  <dig> was located in α helix domain belonging to an   <dig> barrel, and another residue  <dig> was located on the loop between two β-sheets. in the substitution y227h, the replacement of tyrosine by histidine obviously enlarged the shape of the binding pocket . interestingly, when glycine was replaced by arginine at site 442g, the nearest distance between residue  <dig> and residue  <dig>  increased from  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å.fig.  <dig>

discussion
in the present study, trez from zunongwangia sp. was isolated and expressed in e. coli bl <dig> . the optimum temperature for trez is 50 °c, which is higher than that of many previously reported trehalases, such as those in apis mellifera l 7 °c  <cit> , rhodotorula rubra 30 °c  <cit> , saccharomyces cerevisiae 40 °c  <cit> , and rhizopus microsporus var. rhizopodiformis 45 °c  <cit> . however, a trehalase from a thermophilic bacterium rhodothermus marinus has a higher optimal temperature of 88 °c than trez  <cit> .

another remarkable characteristic of trez is its extreme salt-tolerance . the enzyme was found to be active over a wide nacl concentration range  and retaining more than 100 % of its original activity at  <dig> – <dig>  m nacl. this behavior is similar to that of a xylanase and two amylases from zunongwangia sp., which showed the optimum activity at  <dig>   <dig>  and 2 m nacl, respectively . trez retains activity with or without nacl and thus differs from other halophilic enzymes which require salt to remain active and stable, indicating that trez is a salt-tolerant enzyme. to date, several reports have been published about the trehalases, whose activity was enhanced by na+  <cit> . furthermore, trez is relatively stable after 24 h incubation in high salinity conditions . a similar salt tolerance behavior was also observed in xylanase and amylases from zunongwangia sp. . additionally, trez activity was also enhanced by k+, ni+, mg2+, ca2+, and ba2+ and strongly inhibited by fe3+, cu2+, zn2+ and adp .

in this study, we improved the catalytic efficiency of trez  by directed evolution. when ompared to previously reported trehalases in terms of the catalytic efficiency of mutant c <dig> is higher than the trehalases  from metarhizium strains  <cit>  and tre <dig>  from e.coli  <cit> , but lower than the trehalase  from apis mellifera l  <cit>  and trehalase  from spodoptera frugiperda  <cit> .

despite many studies trehalases, only a few further engineered trehalases have been reported. silva et al. reported that three arg residues  are essential for trehalase activity from spodoptera frugiperda  <cit> . in this study, a mutant c <dig>  dramatically improved catalytic activity by directed evolution. to understand the relationship between single mutant site and catalytic efficiency, the single site mutants were constructed separately, respectively. the results showed that y227h and r442g played an important role on the catalytic efficiency of trehalase.

the structure modeling analysis and substrate docking  of y227h revealed a subtle modification of the shape of the binding pocket. according to morley et al.  <cit> , the replacement like y227h far away from the active site may remodel the site arrangement and lead to fine alterations in the protein backbone and side chain, which altered the secondary structure of protein, and also produced a subtle change in the shape of the binding pocket, finally leading to dramatic changes in the catalytic activity of enzyme. the modeled trez and mutant structures  and the docking analysis of the substrate  showed that the residue  <dig> is in the vicinity of the entrance to the active site. in r442g, the replacement of arginine by glycine reduced the size of the side chain of residue  <dig>  due to the reduction of the side-chain functional groups, the nearest distance between residue  <dig> and residue  <dig> become longer, which decreased the steric hindrance, contributed to channel the substrate into the central binding pocket easier and promoted the release of product, finally leading to the improvement of the catalytic efficiency of trehalase.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a novel salt-tolerant trehalase from zunongwangia sp. was cloned, purified, characterized, and engineered. moreover, we found that the mutation sites y227h and r442g make synergic contributions to the catalytic activity of mutant c <dig> and explored that the single mutant site affects the catalytic activity. these results provided useful some insight into the relationship between structure and function of the trehalase.
