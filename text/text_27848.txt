BACKGROUND
in recent years, the damage caused by bacterial pathogens to major crops has been increasing worldwide. pseudomonas syringae  <cit>  is a widespread bacterial species that infects plants and causes many different diseases: leaf and fruit spots, cankers, blights, etc. p. syringae is a gram-negative gamma-proteobacterium that can be isolated from more than  <dig> host plant species of different taxonomic groups, including nearly all major agricultural crops  <cit> . besides being a phytopathogen, this bacterium also occurs as an epiphyte on healthy plants or as a symbiont in phytophagous insects  <cit> . it is also present in all phases of the natural water cycle: in clouds, rain water, snow, antarctic ice, and-in association with algae-in streams and rivers. p. syringae is one of the most important objects for studying the molecular mechanisms of pathogenesis and plant response to infection  <cit> .

the p. syringae species is divided into more than  <dig> pathovars indistinguishable by their physiological  characteristics but infecting specific host plants or causing specific symptoms of a disease. although p. syringae can infect a broad spectrum of plants, its individual strains are only virulent on a limited number of plant species; in the other plants, however, they either induce an immune response or cannot cause a disease at all  <cit> . based on the results of dna–dna hybridization, gardan et. al. divided the p. syringae species into nine genotypes   <cit> . taxonomic studies performed by multilocus sequence typing  revealed that the p. syringae species can be classified into  <dig> to  <dig> phylogenetic groups; some authors merge the p. cichorii and p. viridiflava with the p. syringae species . the phylogenetic groups generally correspond to the genomospecies previously determined by dna–dna hybridization; this classification is confirmed by the genome-wide analysis of representatives of the species  <cit> .

different p. syringae strains use a wide range of biochemical mechanisms that determine their virulence to specific plants. these mechanisms include phytotoxins, ice-nucleation proteins  <cit> , and effectors of the type iii and type iv secretion systems, which determine the specific nature of the pathogen virulence  <cit> . bacteria of different p. syringae pathovars produce four main phytotoxins: coronatine, phaseolotoxin, syringomycin, and tabtoxin  <cit> . though these toxins are potentially important for the bacterial virulence, none of them is sufficient to cause a disease  <cit> .

to date, the genetic diversity of the p. syringae population in the russian federation remains poorly studied. there are several studies devoted to the comparative evaluation of 16s-23s rrna intergenic spacer regions in p. syringae и p. fluorescens and to the rep-pcr analysis of a limited number of pseudomonas strains isolated from cereal crops  <cit> . using mlst, ignatov et. al.  studied a collection of the p. syringae strains isolated from different crops and demonstrated that the strains of phylogroup  <dig> are predominant in russia .

phylogroup  <dig> of p. syringae comprises the majority of the strains isolated from the most different habitats. it comprises the pathovars p. s. pv aceris, p. s. pv aptata, p. s. pv atrofaciens, p. s. pv. avellanae, p. s. pv. coryli, p. s. pv dysoxyli, p. s. pv japonica, p. s. pv lapsa, p. s. pv papulans, p. s. pv pisi, p. s. pv solidagae, and p. s. syringae; it also comprises three previously described genetic subgroups  2a, 2b, and 2c  <cit> . subgroup 2b includes typical strains of such widespread phytopathogens as p. syringae pv. syringae, p. s. pv. aptata, and p. s. pv. atrofaciens, whereas nonpathogenic p. syringae strains, which are phenotypically similar to p. viridiflava, belong to subgroup 2c. in general, the strains of phylogroup  <dig> are characterized by the highest frequency of hypersensitivity reactions  in tobacco plants, diseases in sprouts of wheat and sunflower, and the synthesis of syringotoxin  <cit> .

to assess genetic features of the russian p. syringae strains, we sequenced two p. syringae strains,  <dig> и  <dig>  that infect dicots and monocots, respectively. using phylogenetic analysis, we demonstrated that these strains are related and that they belong to phylogroup  <dig>  clade 2b  together with strains sm and b <dig>  which infect wheat. our aim was to compare the virulence factors in these and other available genomes of phylogroup  <dig> to identify genes responsible for the specialization of bacteria.

methods
strains and pathogenicity tests
strains  <dig> and  <dig> were isolated in the laboratory of plant bacterial diseases at the russian research institute for phytopathology . the strains were stored at –80 °c in king’s b liquid medium  <cit>  with 15% glycerol. before use, a culture was replated on king’s b agar medium.

strain  <dig> was obtained from diseased leaves of a sunflower  collected in the republic of north ossetia-alania in  <dig>  the strain was highly virulent to different dicots and inhibited the germination of their seeds. strain  <dig> was isolated from a winter wheat plant  with symptoms of leaf blight collected in krasnodar krai in  <dig>  the strain was highly aggressive to monocots.

the pathogenicity and virulence of bacteria were assessed by the ability of the bacteria to induce the hypersensitivity reaction within 12 h after infiltrating leaves of tobacco  and pelargonium  with bacterial suspension. the virulence of bacteria was assessed using a number of dicot and monocot species . three methods of plants inoculation were used:  excised cotyledon assay-cotyledons were cut off using a scalpel dipped in a suspension of two pathogen concentrations 108 cfu/ml and 106 cfu/ml;  bacterial suspension  was atomized into a true leaf of a plant; and  a hundred of seeds were soaked in a bacterial suspension  for 1 h before their germination on filter paper. in all the inoculation methods, we used bacterial suspensions obtained from 48-h bacterial cultures on king’s b agar medium and diluted with potassium phosphate buffer ph  <dig> , 10 mm to the desirable concentrations.

phenotypic and biochemical analysis
morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics of bacterial cultures were determined by the methods for the phenotypic differentiation of the pseudomonas genus: lopat ; gatta tests , and the analysis for the ice nucleation activity performed as described in  <cit> .

dna extraction and genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation
bacteria were cultured on king’s b agar medium  <cit> . total dna preparations were isolated from fresh cultures after 2– <dig> days of growth using the method of the dna adsorption on magnetic particles  according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

we sequenced 4–5 μg dna of strains  <dig> and  <dig> on a  <dig> gs-flx titanium platform. the obtained readings were assembled into contigs using the gs de novo assembler software developed by roche . the sequence was annotated using the rast server  <cit> .

selection of strains for the joint analysis; phylogenetic analysis and calculation of the average nucleotide identity  values
to determine the p. syringae phylogroup membership, we used the phylogeny by the citrate synthase  gene. it has previously been shown that the sequence of this gene is sufficiently informative to classify p. syringae strains by clades and phylogroups  <cit> . for the analysis, we selected  <dig> p. syringae strains  covering all the phylogroups  <cit> . the tree was constructed by the maximum likelihood method using the raxml package  <cit> . pseudomonas rhizosphaerae 6b <dig> was used as an outgroup.

to infer phylogenetic relationships between the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  we selected  <dig> p. syringae strains with fully sequenced genomes, including  <dig> and  <dig> . we then used multilocus sequence typing  to construct a phylogenetic tree based on the data on  <dig> household genes   <cit> . strain dc <dig> was used as an outgroup  <cit> . as it has previously been shown, this method provides a sufficiently accurate reconstruction of the phylogenetic relationships in the pseudomonas species  <cit> .

for  <dig> strains of phylogroup  <dig>  including  <dig> and  <dig> , we also calculated the average nucleotide identity  between the genomes using the jspecies package  <cit> .

identification of the pan- and core genomes and unique genes; cog-analysis
the entire pan- and core genomes were identified by ortholog search using the blastp software  <cit> . genes were considered orthologous if the e-value was less than 1 × 10− <dig>  the length of the aligned region was more than 60% of the entire gene length, and the identity of the aligned regions was more than 60%. to identify the entire pan- and core genomes, we selected  <dig> p. syringae strains with fully sequenced genomes, including  <dig> and  <dig> . among the selected strains,  <dig> strains infect monocots  and  <dig> strains infect dicots . strain  <dig> was used to identify pan- and core genomes but was not included into the group d because this strain, as we show in this study, has relatively recently changed the class of its host and may introduce errors into the study.

to construct the pan genome of the strains infecting monocots , the genes found in the group m strains were selected from the entire pan-genome. to construct the pan-genome of the strains infecting dicots, the genes found in the group d strains were selected from the entire pan-genome . core genomes were obtained from the respective pan-genomes.

clusters of orthologous groups  analysis was conducted using the webmga service  <cit> . cog class enrichment was calculated using fisher’s exact test with the fdr correction for multiple testing . the search for associations between the cog groups and the host plant class was performed using fisher’s exact test with the fdr correction for multiple testing.

finding the effectors of the type iii secretion system ; t3ss, t4ss, and t6ss gene clusters; phytotoxin genes; quorum sensing genes; and mobile and crispr elements
we used the database on the effectors of the type iii secretion system in p. syringae available on the site http://www.pseudomonas-syringae.org/. its current version  contains  <dig> unique effectors. the search for effectors was performed by the tblastn algorithm  <cit>  with the e-value threshold of 1 × 10− <dig>  if the alignment was incomplete, we used baltrus’s algorithm: we searched for stop codons that are the nearest from the 5′ and 3′ termini of the aligned region. if a start codon is located between the 5′ stop codon and the start of the alignment and if this start codon belongs to the same reading frame as the aligned region and the 3′ stop codon, it is an active effector. otherwise, the effector is truncated  <cit> . the search for the clusters of the type iii, iv, and vi secretion systems was conducted using the t346hunter server  <cit> .

to find the genes responsible for the phytotoxin synthesis, we used the blastn algorithm  <cit>  with the e-value cutoff of 1 × 10− <dig> and the identity of 80%. to find the genes responsible for the quorum sensing, we used the blastn algorithm with the e-value threshold of 1 × 10− <dig> and the identity of 80%. mobile elements were identified by the is finder service  <cit>  with the e-value threshold of 1 × 10− <dig>  associations were found using fisher’s test with the fdr correction for multiple testing . crispr  elements were identified using the crispr-finder server  <cit> .

RESULTS
characteristics of the strains
main morphological, cultural, and biochemical properties of strains  <dig> and  <dig> of the p. syringae species are given in additional file  <dig>  both strains belong to the lopat 1a group  <cit>  and demonstrate a positive reaction for levan production ; negative reaction for oxidase production ; negative test result for pectinolytic activity on potato ; negative reaction for arginine dihydrolase production ; and negative reactions in the tobacco hypersensitivity test  on nicotiana tabacum plants, ‘samsung’ cultivar, and in the hypersensitivity test on pelargonium × hortorum .

within 12 h after the infiltration, strains  <dig> and  <dig> applied in the concentrations of 108 cfu/ml and 106 cfu/ml induced the hypersensitivity reaction in plants.

moreover, they tested positive for gelatin liquefaction  and aesculin hydrolysis  and tested negative for tyrosinase activity  and tartrate utilization .

the results of the artificial inoculation of plants with pseudomonas syringae strains  <dig> and  <dig> are given in additional file  <dig> 

strains  <dig> used in the concentrations of 108 cfu/ml and 106 cfu/ml induced water-soaked lesions within 48 h after inoculating the leaves of dicots by atomizer. the leaves of monocots did not show such symptoms.

when used in the concentration of 106 cfu/ml, strain  <dig> did not induce severe disease symptoms in dicots but did affect monocots. at the concentration of 108 cfu/ml, the symptoms of strain  <dig> infection manifested in dicots faster than in monocots and resembled the hypersensitivity reaction.

the inoculation of germinating dicots with strain  <dig> used in the concentrations of 108 cfu/ml and 106 cfu/ml decreased the number of germinated seeds and inhibited the growth of seminal roots. no such symptoms were observed when inoculating the seeds of monocots. the inoculation of the plant seeds with strain  <dig> slowed down the germination of monocots but did not affect the growth and development of dicots when the concentrations of 108 cfu/ml or 106 cfu/ml were used.

sequencing, de novo assembly, and annotation of strains  <dig> and 2507
sequencing produced 145  <dig> and 135  <dig> single-end readings with an average length of  <dig> and  <dig> for strains  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. de novo assembly generated draft genomes of strains  <dig> and  <dig>  the length of these genomes was  <dig>  and  <dig>  mb; they consisted of  <dig> and  <dig> contigs, the lengths of which were more than 500 bp and the n <dig> of which were  <dig> and  <dig> kb, respectively . when annotating, we identified  <dig> and  <dig> genes for strain  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, and  <dig> and  <dig> of these genes were protein-coding .table  <dig> key parameters of the assembly and annotation of the genomes of p. syringae strains  <dig> и 2507




phylogenetic analysis
according to the study performed by berge et. al. on  <dig> strains, the p. syringae species divides into  <dig> clades distributed by  <dig> phylogroups, each of which is characterized by its own level of pathogenicity and cold resistance and by the contents of t3se and mobile elements  <cit> . to assign the russian strains to a certain phylogroup, we conducted the phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> p. syringae strains based on the partial cts gene sequence using a strain of the p. rhizosphae species as an outgroup . as it has previously been shown, the tree constructed on the basis of the cts gene adequately reflects the distribution of the strains by clades and phylogroups  <cit> . based on the resulting tree, we can conclude that the russian strains belong to phylogroup  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenetic analysis of strains  <dig> and  <dig>  russian strains are shown in red. letters m or d indicate if a strain infects monocots or dicots, respectively. a phylogenetic tree based on the cts gene of p. syringae  <dig> strains rooted on p. rhizophaerae strain 6b <dig>  the phylogenetic tree is constructed by the maximum likelihood method using the raxml package  <cit> . clade 2b is shown in blue. b. phylogenetic tree for  <dig> strains of phylogroup  <dig> rooted on strain dc <dig>  the phylogenetic tree is based on seven genes  with strong bootstrap support. clade 2b is shown in blue. c clusterization of the strains of phylogroup  <dig> based on the ani values




to clarify the relationship between the strains, out of the total of  <dig> strains, we selected  <dig> strains satisfying the following conditions: all selected strains belong to phylogroup  <dig>  their genomes are fully sequenced, and the classes of their host plants are known . the p. syringae pv. tomato strain dc <dig> was used as an outgroup  <cit> . a phylogenetic tree  was constructed for these strains based on the mlsa of seven household genes . the russian strains,  <dig> and  <dig>  belong to the same clade, namely clade 2b, as the strains b <dig> and sm isolated from wheat.

to confirm the correct clustering of the strains, we calculated pairwise ani values between the genomes and performed the clustering based on these values . this clustering confirmed that the russian strains belong to clade 2b. moreover, it showed that strains  <dig>   <dig>  sm, and b <dig> cluster together.

since strains  <dig>   <dig>  and sm belong to the same clade , we additionally compared their genomes. the contigs of genomes  <dig> and  <dig> were ordered according to the genome of strain sm and aligned by this genome using the progressive mauve software  <cit> . additional file  <dig> shows that the genomes of the russian strains are highly collinear with the sm genome. long insertions and deletions in the alignment generally correspond to the regions of contig breaks. in strain sm, the chromosome region between psssm_ <dig> and psssm_ <dig>  is a prophage cluster. in strain  <dig>  the respective region changed its location and orientation . strain  <dig> lacks this cluster altogether.

another key indicator of the relationship between strains is the conservation of the hrp-cluster structure. we aligned the hrp clusters of  <dig> and  <dig> by strain sm   <cit> . the figure shows that the structure of the cluster is conserved between the studied strains.

analysis of the pan- and core genomes of phylogroup 2
to analyze the pan- and core genomes of phylogroup  <dig>  we selected  <dig> strains with fully sequenced genomes, including two russian strains . these  <dig> selected strains were further divided into groups: the group m comprised  <dig> strains infecting monocots and the group d comprised  <dig> strains infecting dicots. we did not include strain  <dig> into the group d because this strain has relatively recently changed the class of its host and, therefore, may contain both the genes inherent to monocot-infecting strains and the genes inherent to dicot-infecting strains.

the pan-genome of  <dig> strains comprises  <dig> unique genes, whereas their core genome comprises  <dig> unique genes .table  <dig> number of genes in the core and pan-genomes of p. syringae phylogroup  <dig>  groups m  and d 




we annotated the pan-genome of all the  <dig> strains by cog-classes:  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> proteins in the pan genome were annotated. the cog-class enrichment was analyzed for the pan- and core genomes of groups m and d using the fisher’s exact test with the correction for multiple testing. we found no significant differences between the pan- and core genomes of groups m and d . we compared the cog-class enrichment for unique genes of the pan-and core genomes of groups m and d . for the unique genes of the pan-genomes, there is a significant difference in the enrichment of three classes . for the unique genes of the core genomes, there is a significant difference in the enrichment of seven classes  .

for each cog-group, we checked for the random distribution between the strains of groups m and d . as the result, we found seven cog-groups associated with the host plant class but none of these groups passed the threshold after the fdr correction for multiple testing. all seven groups are present in most of the group d strains , and three of the seven groups are present in strain  <dig> .table  <dig> cog-groups associated with the ability to infect dicots




secretory systems of strains sm,  <dig>  and  <dig> and toxins of the strains of p. syringae phylogroup 2
we analyzed the presence of the genes of three secretory systems participating in pathogenesis  in strains sm,  <dig>  and  <dig> .table  <dig> number of genes of the main secretory systems in p. syringae strains  <dig>   <dig> and sm. field notation: total number of the system genes in the strain/number of the system core genes in the strain/total number of the core genes in the system




t6ss was initially described in the vibro cholera bacterium  <cit> . this system was later found in almost a quarter of the species of gram-negative bacteria, mostly in known pathogens. this system is responsible for the transport of the effector proteins participating in the establishment of parasitic or symbiotic relationships between prokaryotes and eukaryotes and for the competition between prokaryotes  <cit> . t6ss is generally represented by two gene clusters: t6ss- <dig> and t6ss- <dig>  these two clusters were found in the russian strains, but the core genes of these clusters are only partially present, which makes the full functioning of t6ss improbable .

t4ss is involved in transporting proteins and dna; particularly, it enables horizontal gene transfer between bacteria or between bacteria and plants  <cit> . the genes of this system were found in all the three strains. sm strain comprises only  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> core components of the system. the russian strains lost almost all t4ss. apparently, t4ss is inessential for the virulence of these strains.

the main function of t3ss is the delivery of effector proteins into the cell body of a host . in all the studied strains, there is a fully functional cluster t3ss- <dig> comprised of  <dig> genes and all of the  <dig> key genes are present. in the russian strains, the cluster t3ss- <dig> only comprises  <dig> genes, but strain  <dig> also lacks one of the  <dig> key genes of t3ss, whereas all of its components are present in strain  <dig>  the missing gene is flip , one of the nine mandatory membrane components  <cit> . in strain sm, the cluster consists of  <dig> genes but it also lacks  <dig> of the  <dig> key genes of t3ss .

all genomes of the phylogroup  <dig> strains were studied to establish the presence of the gene clusters responsible for the synthesis of six phytotoxins of pseudomonads: mangotoxin, syringolin, syringopeptin, syringomycin, tabtoxin, and coronatine . it has previously been shown that tabtoxin and coronatine are not typical of the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  <cit> . syringomycin and syringopeptin are cyclic lipopeptide toxins synthesized by the classic nrps-mechanism  <cit> . both of these toxins are present in strains  <dig>   <dig>  and sm. mangotoxin is an inhibitor of ornithine n-acetyltransferase; it is widespread among the p. syringae strains and the apparatus for its synthesis consists of six proteins combined in the mbo-operon  <cit> . this operon is present in both russian strains and in strain sm. syringolin is absent in strains  <dig> and sm; it is present, however, in strain  <dig> fig.  <dig> distribution of the gene clusters responsible for the phytotoxin synthesis among the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  dark blue indicates the presence of a cluster, blue indicates the absence of some genes in the cluster, and white indicates the absence of cluster. russian strains are shown in red. letters m or d indicate if a strain infects monocots or dicots, respectively




t3ss effector repertoire of phylogroup  <dig> and the russian strains
using the database on the t3ss effectors in p. syringae , we obtained the repertoire of t3ss effectors for each of the studied strains. fig. 3a shows the distribution of the effectors of the type iii secretory system  among the strains of phylogroup  <dig> . the total number of  <dig> effectors were found in the strains of phylogroup  <dig> :  <dig> effectors were found in the group m;  <dig> effectors, in the group d. all the strains have four common effectors: hopah <dig>  hopaa <dig>  hopi <dig>  and hopaa1- <dig>  we checked for the random distribution between groups m and d for each effector using the fisher’s exact test. among all of the studied effectors, only hopba <dig> notably distinguishes groups m and d . however, it does not pass the correction for multiple testing. strains  <dig> and  <dig> have  <dig> and  <dig> effectors , respectively. five of them are common in these strains: four effectors are common in the entire clade, and the remaining one present in both strains is hopba <dig> fig.  <dig> distribution of genes of effectors of the type iii transport system, and mobile elements among the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  russian strains are shown in red. letters m or d indicate if a strain infects monocots or dicots, respectively. a distribution of the genes of effectors of the type iii transport system among the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  dark blue indicates the presence of a gene, blue indicates partial presence of a gene, and white indicates the absence of a gene. b distribution of mobile elements among the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  dark blue indicates the presence of a mobile element and white indicates its absence




mobile elements, quorum sensing, and crispr/cas-system
the genomes of the second phylogroup were analyzed for the presence of mobile elements . the results are shown in fig. 3b. the total of  <dig> elements were found :  <dig> of them were common,  <dig> elements were unique to the group m, and  <dig> elements were unique to the group d. moreover, according to fisher’s exact test,  <dig> of these  <dig> elements are significantly more common in the group d, namely ispsy <dig>  ispsy <dig>  ispsy <dig>  and ispsy <dig>  the presence of isps <dig> significantly determines the group m . when correcting for the multiple testing using the fdr method, none of these mobile elements passes by the criterion of significance . we found ten is in strain  <dig> and four is in strain  <dig>  isps <dig> is present in both groups but none of the strains contain any of the four is characteristic of the group d strains.

all genomes of the second clade were analyzed for the presence of genes responsible for the quorum sensing system. in gram-negative bacteria of the pseudomonas family, this system is represented either by luxi-luxr-genes  <cit>  or by ahlr-ahli-locus  <cit> . none of the luxi system genes were found in the strains of phylogroup  <dig>  the ahlr-ahli system was found only in several of the d group strains  that constitute one clade . these systems were not found in the russian strains.

using the crispr-finder service  <cit> , we found that several regions in the russian strains were identified as the spacer regions of the crispr/cas system. however, the detailed analysis of these regions showed that these are parts of the ice nucleation protein; they also contain repetitions, which the system could mistake for a spacer region. the cas- <dig> protein also wasn’t found in strains  <dig> and  <dig>  apparently, the absence of the crispr/cas system is the feature of p. syringae strains  <cit> .

discussion
comparative genomics is often used to find the genes responsible for the virulence and specificity of phytopathogenic bacteria  <cit> . we compared two previously sequenced groups of phylogroup  <dig> , infecting monocots and dicots, with two genetically similar p. syringae strains of phylogroup 2b; these two strains isolated in russia in 2000s differ by their specialization against monocots and dicots.

comparison of the russian p. syringae strains
the expansion of crop infection areas and an increase in the harmfulness of p. syringae has been reported in russia since 2004– <dig>  <cit> . the previous epiphytotics of basal bacteriosis and leaf spots in crops  in russia was described in the early 1970s  <cit> , which is a bit later than the epiphytotics of similar diseases in 1967– <dig> in usa and canada , and seminal infection played the major role in the spread of pathogens  <cit> . taking into account the earlier emergence of strains sm  and b <dig> , which are the most similar to strains  <dig> and  <dig>  it is possible that the russian strains have common ancestors with strains b <dig> and sm. we can assume that the emergence of strains  <dig> and  <dig> in the russian federation is associated with the import of grain from canada and the united states that took place from the beginning of the 1960s until the 1990s.

to the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to provide data on sequenced p. syringae strains isolated on the territory of the russian federation.

the strains isolated in the russian federation possess the canonical type iii secretion system and a very small set of t3ss effectors. moreover, the strains contain no functional secretion systems of type iv and vi. we also found no genes of the quorum sensing system, which are crucial to inactivate bactericidal substances synthesized by the host plant. the strains contain a limited number of mobile elements  and have no genes of the crisprs system to protect them from bacteriophages and foreign plasmids.

comparative phylogenetic analysis
the phylogenetic analysis of strains  <dig> and  <dig> conducted using the sequence of the cts gene fragment  <cit>  and the total of seven household genes  showed that russian strains  <dig> and  <dig> belong to clade 2b of phylogroup  <dig> of the p. syringae species. moreover, both strains are in the same clade with strains b <dig> and sm, which also infect monocots  <cit> . the relationship of these four strains is confirmed by the conservative structure of the hrp cluster, similar ani values, and high homology of the genomes of strains sm, b <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> 

based on the structure of the phylogenetic tree, we can conclude that strain  <dig> isolated from a dicotyledonous crop is evolutionarily the youngest and that the change of its host class has occurred recently. we conducted a comparative analysis of strains infecting monocots  and dicots  to identify the changes on the genomic level that could lead to the change of the specialization in strain  <dig> 

search for the features of the m and d groups of strains
as expected, the pan- and core genomes of the strain groups m and d  do not differ at the level of cog-classes . the difference is only observed in unique genes of the genomes of these groups . we also tried to identify associations between the host class and the cog-groups. we identified seven cog-groups  associated with the strains that infect dicots .

three unique genes  belong to the lysr group of regulatory proteins. it has previously been shown that the genes of the lysr group play the regulatory role in the expression of the rova gene, which is responsible for the virulence of yersinia pseudotuberculosis enterobacteria  <cit> . the lysr group genes, rovm, are homologous to the virulence regulators pect/hexa of the erwinia phytopathogens, which is another enterobacterial genus. unique proteins of the pseudomonas of this group are most similar to the lysr proteins of gram-positive bacteria spirosoma linguale and proteobacteria burkholderia ubonensis and brevundimonas diminuta.

the unique gene yp_ <dig>  of the lysin exporter group lyse/ygga also participates in transporting other proteins of bacterial metabolism  <cit> . regulatory protein yp_ <dig>  of the asc/lrp group  is one of the essential bacterial transcription regulators, which determine the metabolism intensity  <cit> . interestingly, the groups yp_ <dig>  and yp_ <dig>  are present in strain  <dig>  in all strains of the group d, and only in one strain of the group m, namely strain sm, which is the closest to strain  <dig> on the phylogenetic tree.

the unique gene yp_ <dig>  encodes membrane proteins of the deda group that participate in the protection of the bacterial membrane in the human and animal pathogens salmonella enterica and neisseria meningitides from cationic cytolytic peptides. these proteins are also necessary for the functioning of the type iii secretory system  <cit> . the unique gene yp_ <dig>  encodes the protein of the arac family of transcription regulators, which control the expression of virulence genes in pathogenic bacteria  <cit> . the correct functioning of the genes of the third transport system is achieved by the interaction of several regulatory systems affecting the central gene expression regulator of the arac family  <cit> . it should be noted that most of the unique genes have the closest homologues outside the pseudomonas genus, in the genomes of pathogenic enterobacteria.

when studying the repertoire of the t3ss effectors, we showed that only  <dig> out of the total of  <dig> identified effectors are unique for the group m, whereas the group d contains  <dig> unique effectors . however, the average number of the effectors does not differ significantly in the strains of groups m and d . this fact indicates greater individual variety of the effectors in the strains of the group d, which might partially be explained by the host range. while for the group m hosts came from the same plant family , the range of host organisms of the group d consists of several families.

the analysis of statistical significance of the representation of mobile elements in the strains of groups m and d showed that the mobile element isps <dig> is inherent in the group m, whereas four elements  are inherent in the group d. paper  <cit>  describes isps <dig> as an element unique to the strains that infect monocots  <cit> . interestingly, strain  <dig> contains isps <dig> but does not contain the four mobile elements characteristic of the group d.

CONCLUSIONS
the genomes of pseudomonas syringae strains  <dig>  and  <dig>  isolated on the territory of the russian federation were determined by pyrosequencing and compared with previously published genome sequences of  <dig> genomes of the strains belonging to the same phylogroup and affecting dicots and monocots. we analyzed seven informative genes used in mlst genotyping of p. syringae, calculated the average nucleotide identity , studied the synteny of the hrp-gene clusters, and examined the compositions of the type iii secretion system  effectors and of the elements of insertion sequences . based on the obtained data, we found that strains  <dig> and  <dig> and strains sm and b <dig>  form a subgroup that is stable among the other strains of phylogroup 2b. within this subgroup, the strains  <dig> and  <dig> demonstrated the greatest similarity in the number of common unique genes. moreover, the analysis of the genome of strain  <dig> indicated the recent loss of several genetic elements  that are present in strains  <dig>  b <dig>  and sm. we found three genes , the acquisition of which by strain  <dig> could lead to the change in its host class. the obtained results make it possible to perform a detailed study on the role of the identified genes in the specialization of p. syringae.
