BACKGROUND
virulence of a bacterial pathogen is its relative ability to cause a disease usually described in terms of number of infecting bacteria, the route of its entry into the host body and intrinsic bacterial virulence factors. the bacterial virulence factors are commonly virulent proteins, carbohydrates and other molecules synthesized by bacterial enzymes. the intrinsic virulence factors are under selective pressure which is needed for the bacteria to survive and proliferate in the host cells despite the high mutation rate in bacterial species. the clinical manifestation of a disease depends on the interaction of virulent factors with the host cells and immune system. the most important virulent factors – the virulent proteins are coded in the genes present in the chromosomal dna or mobile genetic elements like bacteriophages or plasmids  <cit> . virulent proteins have been further classified on the basis of mechanisms of virulence. adhesins belong to an important class of bacterial proteins, which play an important role in the process of adherence of bacteria to the host cells. this class of proteins includes fimbria and pili found in escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and neisseria species. adhesins are important vaccine candidates as these bacterial proteins are surface exposed. colonization factors are a class of proteins, which enables certain bacteria to colonize within the host cells, for example helicobacter pylori survives in the acidic milieu of the human stomach by producing urease enzyme, which catalyzes the formation of carbon dioxide and ammonia that can neutralize the acidic ph. the virulence of different strains of helicobacter pylori correlates with the level of production of urease. certain bacteria produce a class of proteins called invasion factors, which disrupt the host cell membranes and stimulates endocytosis, facilitating the entry of bacteria into the host body across protective epithelial tissue layers. similarly, few bacteria are known to produce proteins that bind to the host antibodies. the most commonly known virulence factors are the bacterial toxins that poison the host cells and cause tissue damage. in addition, other elements such as cell surface carbohydrates and proteins that protect pathogens from host defense mechanisms are included in the class of defensive virulence factors which includes capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides and outer membrane proteins. apart from these, there are other virulence traits which are indirectly involved in virulence, such as secretory machineries, siderophores, catalases and regulators; which are equally essential for pathogens to manifest infection  <cit> .

microbial pathogens are responsible for the most devastating diseases and widespread epidemics. however, with the advancements in medical research and availability of effective antimicrobial regimens, the disease burden has reduced remarkably. however, the threat due to certain pathogens is rising due to drug resistant strains and emergence/reemergence of infectious agents, which poses a cause for alarm  <cit> . the microbial genome sequencing projects have given more insight into microbial pathogenesis and drug resistance, opening new avenues for microbial research. with the completion of first pathogen genome sequencing  in  <dig>  <cit> , the number of accomplished sequencing projects has been increasing exponentially. according to a recent report, more than  <dig> microbial genomes have been sequenced, and many more genomes are expected to be sequenced in the next few years  <cit> . the complete sequences of pathogen genomes have provided wealth of information about the determinants of bacterial virulence, however due to diversity and complexity of virulence proteins, the computational tools for interpretation; identification and characterization of virulence-associated proteins are still limited. moreover, a large number of predicted proteins in the microbial genomes are yet to be assigned any function, it is beyond doubt that many of these are virulence associated proteins. hence, availability of prediction methods for virulent proteins will enhance knowledge about bacterial virulence, annotations of  virulent genes and development of novel antimicrobial targets. similarity search methods like blast  <cit>  are expected to distinguish between virulent and non-virulent proteins with reasonable accuracy. however, the choice of this method may not be reasonable in the cases where virulent proteins are evolutionarily distant and do not have significant sequence similarity to known virulent protein sequences. several computational strategies have been proposed to deal with the problems of finding sequences with remote similarity and homology. psi-blast is one such algorithm, which aids in identification of remotely similar proteins  <cit> . another reasonable method to overcome this limitation is the machine learning algorithms. recently, a publication by sachdeva et al.,  <cit> , details a neural network based prediction of virulence factors with a sensitivity of 89%; albeit specific only for adhesins. in this work we have developed a support vector machine  based method for prediction of virulent protein sequences. different svms classifiers were trained with sequence features of bacterial virulent proteins such as amino acid compositions , dipeptide , higher order dipeptide  composition, evolutionary information in the form of pssm profiles, based on psi-blast similarity search and combinations of the above mentioned features. finally, we developed a bilayer cascade svm in which the results from the first layer  were cascaded to train and generate the second layer final svm classifier. the bilayer cascade svm turned out to be the most efficient in differentiating virulent proteins from non virulent ones. a genera-wise breakup of virulent protein sequences used for svm training in the current study is given in the table  <dig> 

RESULTS
algorithm
composition based svm classifiers
firstly, we evaluated the svm classifiers trained and optimized with aac features – developed with linear, polynomial, sigmoid and radial basis function  kernels. each of the kernels was optimized for best performance by changing the kernel parameters . we have optimized the svm classifiers with respect to accuracy and kernel variables. the best c and gamma parameters correspond to maximum accuracy at which the sensitivity and specificity values are nearly equal. for both c and gamma parameters, we have searched a range of  <dig>  to  <dig> 

we found that the aac-svm classifier optimized with rbf kernel has the highest accuracy , better than that of svms optimized with sigmoid , linear  and polynomial  kernels. though, sigmoid, linear and polynomial kernel yielded  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % accuracies respectively, the area under roc plot  obtained with sigmoid kernel , linear kernel  and polynomial kernel  were lower as compared to that of rbf kernel  . table  <dig> also reveals that the sensitivity and mcc of the aac-svm optimized with rbf kernel is much higher as compare to those optimized with other kernels though specificity is marginally lower. hence, rbf kernel was found to be the most suitable kernel for all the svm classifiers-trained and tested in the present study. it has been shown that the prediction methods based on compositional features are more accurate than the homology-based searching for example the problems like prediction of functional roles of proteins, secondary structures and subcellular localization  <cit> . in this study too, the different composition-based svm modules were found to have higher accuracy than that of homology based predictions.

in order to extract the feature vectors for the terminal segments and central region amino acids, we generated an input vector of  <dig> dimensions, by calculating the amino acid composition of  <dig> residues each from the n terminal, c-terminal and the remaining central regions separately. this in turn gives an input vector of  <dig> dimensions –  <dig> from n-terminal,  <dig> from central region and  <dig> from c-terminal segment. the figure s <dig>  illustrates the division of sequence into three segments. the idea was based on the assumption that if virulence-determining amino acids are localized in either of the segments, then the chances of generation of a better trained and efficient svm increase. however, the accuracy of this svm classifier was not greater than  <dig> % for all the svms trained using aac of different lengths of the terminal segments. the performance details of the results obtained for aac-svms based on different lengths of n and c-terminal residues are summarized in the table s <dig> . hence we decided to develop svm classifiers based on features of full-length sequences only.

further, the aac analysis of virulent and non-virulent proteins revealed some interesting results. it was observed that for both virulent and non-virulent proteins the average aac of leucine, alanine, valine and serine was high, whereas those of methionine, histidine, tryptophan, and cysteine were amongst the lowest aacs. furthermore, it was found that residues that have contributed significantly to the development of a successful classification model for virulent and non-virulent proteins are asparagine, serine and alanine . in the case of dipeptide composition, the high average composition was observed for dipeptides such as ll, la, al, ls, sl, aa, vl, tl, sg, and lv for virulent proteins and for non virulent class the most frequently occurring pairs were – ll, la, al, aa, vl, va, lv, lg, gl, and ag . the accuracy of svm classifier based on dipeptide compositions was  <dig> % when trained with the rbf kernel , which is marginally lower than that of the aac based svm module. though dipeptide composition takes care of the information regarding amino acid composition as well as local order of amino acids, there was no improvement in accuracy over aac based predictions. it might be due to very low frequency of occurrence of all possible dipeptides in our present dataset. we also developed a svm modules based on higher order dipeptide compositions  to check if the accuracy can be improved further. we found that the higher order dipeptide  composition based svm classifier was indeed more accurate  than the svm classifier based on lower order dipeptide composition. the results obtained using traditional and higher order dipeptide composition based svm modules are summarized in the table s <dig> . in a nutshell, the composition based svm classifiers were able to achieve a maximum accuracy of  <dig> % .

similarity based classifier
the first step in predicting functions of unknown protein sequences is to carry out similarity-based search with the databases of annotated and characterized protein sequences. this approach is successful if a high scoring hit is returned upon database search . we carried out psi-blast search, using few of the training sequences as query and remaining training sequences as a blast database . a 5-fold cross-validation was performed such that each of the training sequence was used as a part of a query set as well as a training set sequence. psi-blast correctly predicted  <dig> % and  <dig> % of virulent and non-virulent proteins respectively, leading to an overall accuracy of  <dig> % . the detailed results obtained using different iteration values are shown in table s <dig> . this indicates that similarity-based search alone may not be the best strategy for prediction of different kinds of virulent proteins.

hybrid <dig> and hybrid <dig> svm classifiers
in our attempt to further enhance the prediction accuracy, we developed different hybrid classifiers trained with multiple features, for example: the hybrid <dig> classifier was trained with a vector of  <dig> dimensions using individual composition features:  <dig> for aac,  <dig> for dipeptide composition, and  <dig> for higher order dipeptide composition. this classifier was able to predict virulent proteins with an accuracy of  <dig> % , around 2% more than that of the svm classifiers based on aac and higher order dipeptide composition features.

hybrid <dig> svm classifier was trained with composition-based  and similarity-search based features. svm training with similarity-search based results, together with compositional features enhanced the accuracy from  <dig> % to 79% , approximately 5% improvement over that of the hybrid <dig> classifier . therefore, similarity-based search combined with composition-based features yielded higher accuracy.

pssm based svm classifier
the features based on multiple sequence alignments of protein sequences have been successfully applied to improve accuracy of prediction algorithms for secondary structure, solvent accessibility and subcellular localization  <cit> . the basis of the success of the alignment based methods lies in the fact that during protein evolution, the amino acid residues with similar physico-chemical properties tend to be conserved due to selective pressure. psi-blast pssm profiles as a svm training feature have been successfully applied for the prediction of solvent accessibility  <cit> . we found that use of  <dig> dimensional input vector of pssm matrix without normalization, failed to classify virulent and non-virulent proteins with significant accuracy. this may be due to presence of highly divergent scoring values in the generated matrices. hence, we scaled down each matrix element to the range between 0– <dig> by using a sigmoid function for the normalization of matrices. the highest accuracy of svms trained on normalized pssm profiles was  <dig> % , significantly better than any of the svm classifiers based on individual features, developed in the present study . significantly, the classifier was 4% more accurate than the hybrid <dig> classifier. moreover, the classifier performance is better as compared to the similarity based search  and at par with that of the hybrid <dig> classifier.

hybrid <dig> svm classifier
hybrid <dig> classifier was trained with hybrid <dig> features and features based on pssm profiles. the accuracy of optimized hybrid <dig> classifier was  <dig> % , i.e. around 1% improvement over that of the pssm based svm classifier  and comparable to that of the hybrid <dig> classifier. limitation in further improvement in accuracy may be attributable to noise produced by a relatively larger number of input features  and diverse nature of virulent proteins.

cascade svm classifier
evaluations of cascade classifiers based on different hybrid features revealed that the best classifier is the one trained with hybrid <dig> features. the accuracy of the optimized cascade svm classifier was  <dig> % , which is significantly higher than that of all the individual and hybrid svm classifiers developed in the study . the detailed results obtained using the cascade svm module at different threshold values is shown in table s <dig>  the classifier roc curve analysis revealed that the area under curve :  <dig>  for the classifier was greater than that of other non-cascade classifiers . additionally, we also compared the performances of cascade modules of all the hybrids with accuracy greater than  <dig>  , and found the performance of the cascade module of hybrid <dig> features to be the best. hence the cascade svm classifier was chosen for further validation with the independent datasets sequences and generating the virulentpred web server .

testing
prediction performance for independent datasets
an accuracy of  <dig> % was achieved on an independent dataset i using the cascade svm classifier  . virulentpred correctly predicted  <dig> virulent  and  <dig> non-virulent  proteins. independent dataset ii was used to check if virulentpred can be used to predict virulent proteins in the proteomes of organisms, the sequences of which were not used for svm training. out of  <dig> independent dataset ii protein sequences,  <dig> proteins were correctly predicted by virulentpred, leading to an overall accuracy of  <dig> %. further, the prediction accuracies for the bordetella, campylobacter, haemophilus, listeria and neisseria protein sequences were calculated to be  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> %, respectively. the prediction accuracies discussed above indicate that virulentpred may be used as a general virulent protein sequence prediction method.

values in parenthesis correspond to the number of true hits obtained.

prediction performance for eukaryotic proteins
finally, we also evaluated the performance of virulentpred for eukaryotic protein sequences. the eukaryotic virulent proteins were mainly neurotoxins and the test sequences  were randomly selected from the database used to develop ntxpred method  <cit> . since, the method was purely trained on prokaryotic protein sequences; a lower accuracy was expected for eukaryotic proteins. unexpectedly, the method was able to correctly predict  <dig> query virulent proteins as virulent, with a sensitivity of 96%. however, virulentpred was unable to predict non-virulent proteins. out of the  <dig> randomly selected non-virulent proteins from the ntxpred dataset, only  <dig> proteins  were correctly predicted, giving a high percent of false-positives. hence, an overall performance  of the classifier for the prediction of eukaryotic virulent protein sequences is very poor. the poor performance of virulentpred for eukaryotic sequences may be due to amino acid compositional differences with the virulent proteins of prokaryotic origin. as expected, we also observed differences in aacs of eukaryotic and prokaryotic virulent proteins. it was found that in the eukaryotic virulent proteins, most frequently occurring amino acids residues are cysteine, glycine, lysine, leucine, and serine, whereas lysine, alanine, and serine in bacterial virulent proteins. the dipeptides such as gy, yc, ck, sg, gk, kk, and kc were more abundant in eukaryotic virulent proteins, and that in the case of bacterial proteins – ll, la, al, ls, sl, aa, vl, and tl. the eukaryotic virulent and non virulent datasets may be downloaded from virulentpred web server site.

predictions for bacterial proteomes
we also tested virulentpred predictions on complete proteomes of several bacterial pathogens. to perform the tests, we decided to use a higher threshold  to minimize false positive hits, as these were blind tests, without any supportive evidence for the query proteins to be virulent- for example- to be surface bound, secreted or released. to arrive at a reasonable stricter threshold value, we distributed the independent datasets proteins  according to their svm scores into different ranges between - <dig>  to  <dig>  . the distribution shows that several non-virulent proteins  fall up to the range corresponding to the svm score of  <dig>  however, it may be seen that for a threshold of ≥ <dig> , most of the true positive hits are captured and the false positive predictions are minimum, hence we decided to use a threshold of ≥ <dig>  for whole genome predictions. a similar analysis for the training dataset  also yielded similar results, supporting the choice for a higher threshold , a summary of scores in different ranges for the independent dataset sequences and training dataset sequences is available in the table s <dig> .

using the higher threshold of svm score, we started our search with the protein sequences of the smallest forms of the monera kingdom-mycoplasma genetalium, a parasitic bacterium colonizing in genital and respiratory tracts of primates. mycoplasma genetalium is of special interest to the developmental biologists as it is the organism with the smallest genome, next only to that of viruses. out of  <dig> protein sequences of mycoplasma genetalium, virulentpred was able to classify  <dig> sequences,  as virulent on the basis of svm predicted scores at the threshold value of  <dig> . however, at a threshold ≥ <dig> ,  <dig> % of sequences were predicted as virulent. in addition, we also checked the performance of our method for proteomes of chlamydia trachomatis , rickettsia prowazekii , helicobacter pylori , and treponema pallidum . the prediction summary obtained for proteomes of the  <dig> pathogens are shown in figure  <dig>  besides, we also tested virulentpred method on the complete proteomes of two non-pathogenic bacteria such as mycobacterium smegmatis  and listeria innocua  to establish the reliability of virulentpred method. the outputs show that the chances of false prediction are very less for the prediction of virulent proteins at higher threshold, hence increasing the reliability.

several protein sequences were predicted to be virulent with high scores. high scoring proteins include a host of experimentally verified virulent proteins and hypothetical proteins in several bacterial proteomes. the examples of the latter include the following swiss-prot entries of rickettsia prowazekii proteins: y169_ricpr , y192_ricpr , y222_ricpr , y244_ricpr , y867_ricpr .

implementation
the svm classifiers developed in the study have been implemented as world wide web server – virulentpred using cgi/perl scripts . though the server provides options to select different classifiers and threshold values, a default prediction is performed with the bi-layer cascade svm classifier at a threshold value of  <dig> . the server accepts input protein sequences in fasta format.

comparison with other servers
to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of a computational method to classify protein sequences into virulent and non-virulent. however, recently two methods: spaan  <cit>  and vicmpred  <cit>  have been reported which predict specific virulent proteins. vicmpred classifies bacterial proteins into  <dig> different functional classes: virulence factors, information molecule, cellular process and metabolism molecule . however, the method is based on training with  <dig> gram-negative bacterial virulence protein sequences whereas virulentpred is trained with  <dig> diverse virulent protein sequences from different bacteria. hence, it is not justified to compare virulentpred with the vicmpred method. on the other hand, spaan is a neural network based method for prediction of adhesins only. however, we have run virulentpred on spaan dataset of  <dig> adhesins and  <dig> non-adhesins proteins. we found that out of  <dig> adhesins, virulentpred was able to predict  <dig> proteins as virulent . this may be due to the fact that virulentpred has been developed as a general virulent protein prediction method, where svms were trained with diverse features of different kinds of virulent proteins. as a result, there could be decay in the signals related to a particular class of virulent proteins. however, out of the  <dig> non-adhesin protein sequences, only  <dig> sequences were correctly predicted to be non-virulent. this was mainly due to the fact that the spaan training dataset includes several archaebacterial, viral and yeast non virulent proteins. however, virulentpred was developed only with bacterial sequences; hence the method was not very efficient in prediction of viral and eukaryotic protein sequences. intriguingly, out of  <dig> spaan non virulent protein sequences of bacterial and archaebacterial origin, virulentpred correctly predicted  <dig> protein sequences .

CONCLUSIONS
virulentpred classifies bacterial virulent sequences from non virulent proteins with an accuracy of  <dig> %. we have demonstrated that virulentpred efficiently classifies sequences not used in the training, including the ones from the organisms independent of the study. for the whole proteome runs, the virulentpred prediction efficiency is better when predictions are run with higher threshold. the virulentpred predicts virulent proteins irrespective of the subclass or specific molecular function hence the method may be used as general prediction method for virulent protein sequences from prokaryotic genomes.
