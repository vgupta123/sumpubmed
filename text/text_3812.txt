BACKGROUND
covalent histone modifications are key in chromatin regulatory mechanisms. one such histone modification, lysine methylation, can have both activating and repressive functions on transcriptional events. histone lysine methyltransferases  are transcriptional co-regulators that target specific lysines on histones h <dig> and h <dig>  and can transfer up to three methyl groups   <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms of histone mark recognition remain unclear  <cit> . epigenetic marks on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> have been reported to play primary roles in regulating the chromatin and contribute to the histone code that is still obscure  <cit> . h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> methylation are associated with a locally relaxed chromatin and transcriptionally active genes, whereas methylation of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> are repressors and hallmarks of condensed chromatin at silent loci. dysfunctions in the regulation of histone methylation are linked to an increasing number of pathological conditions.

the nuclear receptor-binding set domain  family, a part of the hmtase kmt <dig> family, is composed of three hmtases: nsd <dig>  nsd2/mmset/whsc <dig>  and nsd3/whsc1l <dig>   <cit> . the nsd proteins are oncogenes highly expressed in numerous pathological conditions and are considered attractive novel therapeutic targets in cancers  <cit> . the amplification of nsd <dig> has been reported in multiple myeloma, lung cancer, neuroblastoma and glioblastoma. the amplification of either nsd <dig> or nsd <dig> triggers cellular transformation  <cit> . nsd <dig> is associated with tumor aggressiveness or prognosis in most types of cancers, including prostate cancer and multiple myeloma and is overexpressed in at least  <dig> different cancers  <cit> . increased nsd <dig> activity is also reported during tumor proliferation in glioblastoma and myeloma  <cit> , resulting in aberrantly high global levels of h3k36me <dig>  <cit> . nsd <dig> is amplified in primary breast carcinoma, bladder cancer, lung cancer, and liver cancer  <cit> . abnormal fusion proteins containing nsd family members, including nsd1-nup <dig> and nsd3-nup <dig> fusions, increase h3k <dig> methylation, leading to acute myeloid leukemia  <cit> .

although nsd proteins are instrumental in the development of numerous cancers, their mechanisms of action in carcinogenesis are still unclear. in particular, the substrate specificity of the nsd members remains unsettled and conflicting data have been reported  <cit> . nsd <dig> has h3k36-specific mono- and di-methylation activities but methylation on h4k <dig> by nsd <dig> has also been reported  <cit> . nsd <dig> activity performs h3k36-specific mono- and di-methylation on chromatin, but di-methylation activity for h4k <dig> at dna double-strand breaks has also been reported  <cit> . a significant increase in h3k36me <dig> by nsd <dig> at promoter regions has also recently been demonstrated  <cit> , but potentially ruled-out in another study  <cit> . in addition, nsd <dig> has been shown to methylate h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig>  <cit> . discrepancies regarding nsd <dig> methylation activities on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig> have also been reported  <cit> . complicating the mechanisms further, both nsd <dig> and nsd <dig> have been shown to methylate nf-κb  <cit> . thus, no consensus on the substrate specificity of the nsd members has been established  <cit> . multiple factors may be responsible for these discrepancies, such as the cellular context, the nature of the substrate , the integrity of the enzymes , and the assays employed.

despite uncertainties regarding nsd substrates, it appears that increased levels of h3k <dig> methylation concomitant with decreased levels of h3k <dig> methylation by deregulated nsd members is a driving mechanism in chromatin regulation  <cit> . therefore, the inhibition of nsd members by small molecules represents a valuable therapeutic strategy in several human cancers where elevated levels of nsd members have been reported  <cit> .

the nsd family members are large multi-domain proteins with four zinc finger domains, two pwwp domains and a catalytic set domain   <cit> . the set domain is subdivided into pre-set, set, and post-set domains, all domains are required for catalytic function . the function of phd1- <dig> and pwwp1- <dig> domains of the three nsd members on chromatin remains elusive. however, a recent study demonstrated the role of the conserved phd <dig> domain in localizing nsd <dig> on histone h <dig>  <cit> . the phd <dig> domain of the nsds may function as a recognition module for histone-lysine marks, helping to position the catalytic set domain on its lysine substrate  <cit> . the phd <dig> domain is 36-residues downstream of the post-set subdomain. due to its immediate vicinity to the post-set subdomain, phd <dig> may be a structural component of the catalytic set domain. similarly, the pwwp <dig> domain is also conserved across nsd members and 72-residues upstream of the pre-set subdomain. the role of this pwwp <dig> domain remains unclear.figure  <dig>

previous studies have investigated either full-length nsd members or the catalytic set domain alone through various experimental approaches, resulting in discrepant conclusions. herein, we focus on understanding histones h <dig> and h <dig> recognition and methylation in vitro by the nsds. in this study, we investigate the function of the carboxyl terminal domain  of all three nsd members using a consistent experimental approach, in vitro. the nsds-ctd contains the pre-set, set, post-set, and phd <dig> domains within the catalytic core as well as a histone-recognition module. we quantified the pan-methylation properties of the ctd of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> in vitro. next, we used md simulations to elucidate the binding of the nsd catalytic set domain  on histone tails. taken together, this study provides insights relevant to the design of specific and selective nsd inhibitors.

methods
cloning
the carboxyl terminal domains  of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> genes were cloned as follows; nsd1-ctd , nsd2-ctd , and nsd3-ctd  were amplified by pcr using a human liver cdna library  as the template. the sets of forward and reverse primers used were 5′-gctgaggtcgaccatcctcgagctgttccttcc-3′ and 5′-cggtacgcggccgcgcacatactcacggatctcccc-3′ for nsd1-ctd, 5′- caggcgcatatgttcccgtacatggagggggac-3′ and 5′- cgcctgctcgagtttgccctctgtgactctccg-3′ for nsd2-ctd, and 5′- ctgaacgtcgacggccttaaacatgacttgggg-3′ and 5′- gacaccgcggccgcattcttttacttcttctccatg-3′ for nsd3-ctd. the pcr-amplified nsd1-ctd and nsd3-ctd fragments  and the nsd2-ctd fragment  were inserted into the corresponding restriction enzyme sites of the multi-cloning site of the protein expression intein-tagging vectors ptyb <dig> or ptyb <dig> . all sequences were verified by sequencing.

protein expression and purification
escherichia coli expression bl <dig>  strain was transformed with ptyb <dig> or ptyb <dig> plasmids harbouring nsd1-ctd, nsd2-ctd, and nsd3-ctd . the transformed strains were grown in lb medium containing  <dig> μg/ml ampicillin and the expression of recombinant nsd-ctds was induced with  <dig> μm isopropyl 1-thio-d-galactopyranoside  for  <dig> h at  <dig> °c. e. coli cells were harvested and lysed by a freeze-thaw method and incubated in buffer a  containing  <dig>  % triton x- <dig> and  <dig> mm phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride  and treated with  <dig> cycles of sonication on ice. the resulting cell extract containing nsd-ctd-intein-cbd  fusion proteins was loaded onto an affinity column of chitin beads and washed with  <dig> column volumes of buffer a with  <dig>  % triton x- <dig>  followed by  <dig> column volumes of buffer a without triton x- <dig>  to remove bacterial chaperones bound to the recombinant proteins, the recombinant nsd-ctd-bound chitin beads were washed with  <dig> bed volumes of buffer a containing  <dig> mm adenosine triphosphate  and  <dig>  mm mgcl <dig>  the affinity column was washed with  <dig> bed volumes of buffer a and nsd-ctd proteins were cleaved off from the chitin beads by incubation in buffer a with  <dig> mm 2-mercaptoethanol at  <dig> °c for  <dig> h. after elution in buffer a, samples were concentrated and 2-mercaptoethanol was washed off using amicon ultra centrifugal filters  and then used for methyltransferase assays. a small portion of purified nsd-ctds was resolved through sds-page and coomassie staining showed soluble and pure nsd-ctds at approximately the expected molecular weight of  <dig>  kda ,  <dig>  kda  and  <dig>  kda  . the resulting recombinant nsd-ctds proved stable and retained their catalytic properties for an extended period of time when stored at − <dig> °c.

histone methyltransferase assays
histone methyltransferase activities of nsd-ctds on h3k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  k <dig>  and h4k <dig> were measured using colorimetric quantification kits  following the manufacturer’s protocol. as for h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig>  the purified recombinant nsd-ctds  were incubated with a recombinant histone h <dig> or h <dig>  and a methyl group donor  in the strip wells coated with the specific antibodies for 60– <dig> min at room temperature. the specific antibodies attached to the bottom of the strip wells captured methylated substrates. as for h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig>  instead of the antibody-coated strip wells, biotinylated histone substrates were used and stably captured on the strip wells during the  <dig> min incubation at  <dig> °c. the captured biotinylated histone substrates were next incubated with a high-affinity antibody for  <dig> min at room temperature with shaking at  <dig> rpm. excess of purified nsd-ctds, histones, sam, and antibodies were thoroughly washed away and the strip wells attached with antibody-bound or biotinylated h3/h4me were incubated with the labeled detection antibodies for  <dig> min at  <dig> °c, swirling at  <dig> rpm in the dark. after thoroughly washing the wells, the methylation level was quantified through a hrp-conjugated secondary antibody-color development system with an elisa plate reader at  <dig> nm. the antibodies provided by epigentek are validated and showed no cross-reaction between the substrates. assays were performed in duplicate. the results were normalized against a control that did not contain any enzymes .figure  <dig>

molecular modeling, docking, and energy minimization
the crystal structure of the catalytic domain  of nsd <dig>  served as a template for building homology models of nsd2-cd  and nsd3-cd . multiple-sequence alignment was done with clustalw v <dig> . <dig> and  <dig> models were generated using modeler v <dig> . the best model, according to the intrinsic modeler function, was subjected to side-chains positioning using the scwrl <dig> program. stereochemistry was checked with procheck. the model was manually inspected with coot. the histone tail peptides were manually built in coot with the following residues: h3k <dig> , h3k <dig> , h3k <dig> , h3k <dig> , h3k <dig> , and h4k <dig> . a structural overlay between nsd1-cd  and the crystal structure of set <dig> bound to histone h <dig> peptide  was used to manually place and orientate the h3- or h4-peptide tails into the histone binding site of nsd1-cd, nsd2-cd, and nsd3-cd using the ssm algorithm in coot. prior to md calculations, all the raw modelled histone tail peptides exhibited a similar conformation. electrostatic charge calculations were performed using the pdb2pqr server  with default settings  regardless of the conformation of the peptide tail. we hypothesized the electrostatic charge calculations were not affected by the conformation of the peptide tail as all modelled short peptide tails have a highly similar initial conformation.

electrostatic calculations were performed with apbs v <dig> . <dig> and the molecular surfaces with the electrostatic properties were rendered with both vmd v <dig> . <dig> and pymol v <dig> .

energy minimizations and molecular dynamics simulations in a water box
the peptide-nsd-cd complexes were fully solvated in a water box  using vmd  <dig> . the molecular systems used for energy minimizations  and molecular dynamics  contained the following number of atoms: nsd1-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd1-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd1-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd1-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd1-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd1-cd-h4k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd2-cd-h4k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h3k <dig>   <dig>  atoms; nsd3-cd-h4k <dig>   <dig>  atoms. about  <dig> % of the atoms were from the water molecules. em and md were performed with namd v <dig>  using the charmm force field. a constant temperature was maintained using a langevin damping at  <dig> k, and the pressure was held constant at  <dig> atmosphere with a langevin piston. electrostatic forces were taken into account using the particle mesh ewald  method with a  <dig> Å cut-off distance. the solvated complexes, histone-peptide-nsd-cd, were first equilibrated with  <dig>  steps  of conjugate gradient em followed by  <dig> cycles of  <dig>  steps  of md and  <dig>  steps  of em. the last step was  <dig> ns of em. each solvated complex of histone-peptide-nsd-cd was subjected to a total of  <dig>  steps  of md and a total of  <dig>  steps  of em. em steps were long enough to reach a local minimum with Δε <  <dig> kj/mol. after the md simulations, the solvated complexes were manually checked for ideal stereochemistry with coot. the md trajectories were analyzed with vmd  <dig>  and the plots of the total energy versus timescale were plotted using gnuplot  <dig> .

binding energy determination
binding energy was calculated as follows: εbinding = εcomplex –  using the total energy calculations of namd  <cit> . models of the last md step were stripped from solvent molecules and used to calculate the binding energy of the complex. models of the binding complex, peptides, and nsd-cd apo were all subjected to the same em procedure prior to binding energy calculation. models were energy minimized with  <dig>  steps  of conjugate gradient em followed by  <dig>  steps  of md and  <dig>  steps  of em   <cit> . em steps were long enough to reach a local minimum with Δε <  <dig> kj/mol. a constant temperature was maintained by using langevin damping at  <dig> k and the pressure was held constant at  <dig> atmosphere with a langevin piston.

model analysis and validation
the details of the interactions between the nsd-cd and h3- or h4- peptides were analyzed with ligplot  <cit> . the confirmation of interaction maps was manually done through visual inspections of the models in coot  <cit> .

RESULTS
the ctd of nsd members can methylate multiple histone lysines in vitro
to examine whether the ctd of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> specifically recognizes and methylates multiple lysines of h <dig> and h <dig> in vitro, we quantified the pan-methylation of nsd1-ctd, nsd2-ctd, and nsd3-ctd on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> .

reinberg and colleagues reported that nsd2-set domain methylates h4k <dig> on octamers, which could be linked to histone deposition and/or to the response to dna damage  <cit> . although h4k <dig> methylation remains to be investigated, it was omitted in this study due to lack of a suitable and consistent assay.

overall, nsd1-ctd, nsd2-ctd, and nsd3-ctd exhibit similar substrate recognition and methylation properties, but reduced methylation activities were observed for nsd3-ctd . h3k4me <dig> and h3k27me <dig> species were preferably detected rather than –me <dig> and –me <dig> species for both nsd1-ctd and nsd2-ctd. in contrast, h3k9-me <dig> & -me <dig> and h3k79-me <dig> & -me <dig> species were favored against –me <dig> species.

unlike nsd1-ctd and nsd2-ctd, nsd3-ctd showed a lower, but significant, activity  and the methylation properties of nsd3-ctd on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h3k <dig> were almost identical to those of nsd1-ctd and nsd2-ctd. however, h4k <dig> methylation varied among all nsd-ctds. nonetheless, significant activity of nsd1-ctd on mono-/tri-methylation, nsd2-ctd on di-/tri-methylation, and nsd3-ctd on di-/tri-methylation of h4k <dig> were observed, indicating that h4k <dig> is an in vitro target for all nsd-ctds. importantly, h3k <dig> was methylated by all nsd-ctds and appears to be the preferable in vitro substrate for nsd1-ctd.

taken together, our data indicate that, in vitro, the ctd of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> is able to recognize and methylate h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> with significant differences in catalytic activities depending on the substrate. although some hmtases  do not retain significant methyltransferase activity in vitro  <cit> , this was not the case for nsd members, where significant enzymatic activities were measured .

molecular modelling and the open-and-closed conformation of the catalytic domain
our data showed that, in vitro, the ctd of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> has the ability to recognize and methylate several histone lysines . to gain further insight into histone lysine methylation by the nsd members, we investigated conformational modifications of the catalytic domain  to gain access to the lysine-binding pocket. the crystal structure of nsd1-cd  is devoid of substrate and the histone-lysine binding area is occluded by a regulatory loop at the interface of the set and post-set regions   <cit> . previously, we showed that molecular determinants of this regulatory loop extend over the histone-binding site, sterically preventing substrates from binding  <cit> . the h3k <dig> hmtase mll <dig> also has been described to have a flexible post-set responsible for the open-and-closed conformation of the lysine-substrate binding site  <cit> .figure  <dig>

the crystal structure of nsd1-cd  was used to build the corresponding cds of nsd <dig> and nsd <dig> by homology modelling. a pair-wise sequence alignment between the template and the target showed that the nsd2-cd  shares  <dig>  % identity and  <dig>  % similarity with the nsd1-cd , whereas the nsd3-cd  shares  <dig>  % identity and  <dig> % similarity with the nsd1-cd. protein sequences sharing at least  <dig> % identity are likely to share similar structures, thus all nsd1-cd, nsd2-cd, and nsd3-cd are likely to share a similar scaffold .

next, we used molecular dynamics  to investigate the docking of peptides containing histone lysine , nsd1-cd, nsd2-cd, and nsd3-cd. the initial models were based on the crystal structure of nsd1-cd solved in a closed apo-conformation. therefore, models of the apo cd of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> docked with peptides were deliberately brought into a sterically unstable conformation. energy minimizations and long md simulations performed in a water box centered on the protein relieved the steric clashes and forced the cds into an open conformation that accommodates substrates . long-range md simulations were applied to allow complexes to equilibrate into stable conformations with little rmsd oscillations observed for the post-set regions   <cit> . the resulting models may approximate the conformations of the opened cd potentially resulting from the binding of nucleosomal dna as an allosteric effector. following the md simulations, the structural modifications observed were on the cd of nsd <dig> and nsd <dig>  specifically on a loop at the interface between the set and post-set regions . this specific loop rotated ~40° and translated ~ <dig> Å at the tip, which is a significant displacement   <cit> . the rest of the backbone did not undergo significant structural modifications, with an overall cα-rmsd <  <dig>  Å.figure  <dig>

molecular binding details of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> peptides
the cds of the nsds are likely to share highly similar structural features . the histone tail-binding area only becomes accessible when the regulatory loop at the interface between the set and post-set regions is rotated and displaced, exposing a negatively-charged surface area suitable for the docking of the positively charged h <dig> and h <dig> peptide tails .

as a step forward towards understanding the molecular details of substrate recognition by nsd-cds, we used md simulations to examine the binding characteristics of h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> peptides. overall, our data indicate that all the histone h <dig> and h <dig> peptides tested  share similar steric hindrance and have similar positive charges related to their electric field and molecular surface. these properties imply favourable binding energies for the nsd-cds .table  <dig>

peptides are as follows: h3k <dig> ; h3k <dig> ; h3k <dig> ; h3k <dig> ; h3k <dig> ; h4k <dig> . the polye is a 6-mer poly-glutamic acid peptide used as a control experiment for the docking studies.



the total energy of the complexes after the md simulations was highly comparable between the tested substrates , indicating that all peptides tested similarly bind to the nsd members . in addition, the regulatory loop acts as a “seat belt” to anchor a single histone tail into the binding domain, which allows the lysine substrate to extend toward the cofactor-binding site for the catalytic reaction to occur . the peptide-binding area is large enough to accommodate a seven-amino acid peptide. interestingly, the seven-a.a. peptides  share highly similar steric and electrostatic properties . in addition, all the h <dig> and h <dig> histone peptides tested were also firmly stabilized into the histone-tail binding cleft of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds . this observation is consistent with the calculated binding energies, reflecting the proper steric and electrostatic compatibilities between histone peptides and the cds .

the binding of histone h <dig> and h <dig> peptides induces significant modifications to the histone-binding pocket. in addition to the movement of the regulatory loop seating on top of the histone tail, an induce-fit mechanism triggers changes locally in the backbone along with the rotation of the side chain of key amino acids creating an extensive network of hydrogen bonds anchoring the h <dig> and h <dig> peptides . specifically, h3k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with ala <dig>  asp <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  tyr <dig>  leu <dig> and asn <dig> in nsd <dig>  with tyr <dig>  ala <dig>  asn <dig>  his <dig>  met <dig>  ser <dig>  asn <dig>  tyr <dig> and asn <dig> in nsd <dig>  and with tyr <dig>  ala <dig>  val <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  ser <dig>  met <dig>  and his <dig> in nsd <dig>  h3k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with phe <dig>  thr <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  met <dig>  tyr <dig>  glu <dig>  cys <dig>  leu <dig> and asn <dig> in nsd <dig>  with asp <dig>  met <dig>  thr <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  leu <dig> and asn <dig> in nsd <dig>  and with met <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  h3k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with thr <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  cys <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  with tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  thr <dig>  phe <dig>  thr <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  leu <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  and, with thr <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asp <dig>  cys <dig>  leu <dig>  asn <dig>  arg <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  h3k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with asp <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  glu <dig> and asn <dig> in nsd <dig>  with thr <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  leu <dig>  cys <dig>  gly <dig>  asn <dig> and glu <dig> in nsd <dig>  and, with thr <dig>  thr <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asp <dig> and cys <dig> in nsd <dig>  h3k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with ile <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig>  cys <dig>  asn <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  with trp <dig>  ala <dig>  his <dig>  ile <dig>  thr <dig>  his <dig>  phe <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  leu <dig>  leu <dig>  asn <dig>  and arg <dig> in nsd <dig>  and with asn <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  thr <dig>  lys <dig>  tyr <dig>  cys <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  h4k <dig>  peptide is stabilized by hydrogen bonds with trp <dig>  ile <dig>  thr <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  tyr <dig>  leu <dig>  glu <dig>  cys <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  with ala <dig>  asn <dig>  ile <dig>  thr <dig>  phe <dig>  met <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  cys <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig>  and with val <dig>  thr <dig>  asn <dig>  phe <dig>  arg <dig>  met <dig>  asn <dig>  tyr <dig>  asp <dig>  asn <dig> and thr <dig> in nsd <dig> 

the docking of all histone peptides on the cd is associated with a significantly favorable docking energy, highlighting good substrate compatibilities. as a control experiment, we modelled the docking of a largely electronegative 7-mer poly-glutamic acid  peptide that induces significant steric hindrance in the peptide binding-pocket. the docking of the polye peptide is associated with highly unfavorable binding energies, highlighting its poor fit to any of the nsd-cds, as anticipated .

taken together, our data indicate that the histone-binding pocket of the nsd members is equally compatible with the histone peptides tested, offering steric and electrostatic matches for the stabilization of the h <dig> and/or h <dig> histone tail.

hmtases are essential in maintaining chromatin through modifications of histone tails. in this study, we examined the histone-lysine recognition and methylation properties of nsd1-ctd, nsd2-ctd, and nsd3-ctd in vitro to understand the extent of their catalytic properties and provide medicinal chemistry insights into the design of nsd inhibitors.

some hmtases, such as set <dig>  do not retain significant methyltransferase activity in vitro  <cit> , unlike ctds of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> . although significant differences in methyltransferase activities have been observed, it is unambiguous that the ctd can recognize and methylate various histone substrates in vitro . our data indicate that the ctds of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig> recognize and methylate h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig> and h4k <dig> in vitro . in addition, other work has shown h4k <dig> methylation by the nsd2-set domain on octamers  <cit> . this contrasts with in vivo results where the nsds are exclusive to one substrate h3k <dig> or h4k <dig> 

in vivo, nsd <dig> activity is specific to either h3k <dig> or h4k <dig> depending on the cellular context  <cit> . the level of hmtase activity also depends on the nature of the substrate . the nsd <dig> set domain alone can also methylate h3k <dig> in vitro, generating at least h3k36me <dig>  <cit> . h3k <dig> methylations have been predominantly reported for the nsd members and have significant roles in transcriptional activation, alternative splicing events, and dna repair  <cit> . methylations on h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  h3k <dig>  and h4k <dig> by nsd members have also been identified. nsd members might possibly have unique methylation capabilities that respond to a specific cellular context in vivo.

the methylation of non-histone protein targets has previously been shown for hmtases such as g9a targets, wiz, cdyl <dig>  and acinus  <cit> , and set7/ <dig> target, suv39h <dig>  <cit> . g9a is capable of automethylation on the non-enzymatic n-terminal part of the enzyme  <cit> . interestingly, nsd <dig> and nsd <dig> methylate both histone and non-histone substrates equally. nf-κb is activated through nsd1-mediated mono- and di-methylation on lysine  <dig>  <cit> . nsd <dig> directly interacts with nf-κb for the activation of target genes, including il- <dig>  il- <dig>  vegfa, cyclin d, bcl- <dig>  and survivin in castration-resistant prostate cancer cells   <cit> . nsd <dig> is recruited to the target gene promoters upon induction and mediates nf-κb activation-associated elevation of histone h3k36me <dig> and -me <dig> marks at promoters  <cit> . less is known about nsd <dig>  but non-histone methylation is potentially one of its biological functions as well.

in the absence of substrate, the histone-binding pocket of the nsd members is closed, similar to the h3k <dig> hmtase mll <dig>  <cit> . our data suggest that the binding of the histone-peptide itself is not entirely responsible for displacing the post-set regulatory loop in vivo. instead, the binding of histones or nucleosomal dna could be an allosteric effector that triggers the opening of the catalytic domain. nonetheless, our assays indicate that, in vitro, the binding of either h <dig> or h <dig> histone triggers the opening of nsd-cd. the binding cavity appears to equally accommodate the 7-mer histone peptides tested , likely due to all being electrostatically positively charged and presenting homologous steric hindrance. in the case of nsd <dig>  the binding of the h4k <dig> peptide is favorable and stabilized by an extensive network of hydrogen bonds. the binding of the h3k <dig> peptide is strongly anchored in the opened-set domain of nsd <dig> with ten hydrogen bonds  . however, a better catalytic efficiency in vitro is observed on h3k <dig> rather than h4k <dig>  which could perhaps be ascribed to a more favorable conformation of the lysine substrate . differences calculated in binding energies can be due to differential stabilization properties, which are not necessarily linked with catalytic efficiencies.

analysis of peptide-protein interactions reveals a conserved binding motif for all the nsd members composed of a quartet of phenylalanine, arginine, methionine and asparagine . the trio of conserved phenylalanine, arginine and methionine is located on the pre-set domain phe <dig> , phe <dig> , phe <dig> ; arg <dig> , arg <dig> , arg <dig> ; met <dig> , met <dig> , met <dig>  whereas the asparagine consensus asn <dig> , asn <dig>  and asn <dig>  sits at the interface of the set and post-set region, on the flexible regulatory loop we previously identified  <cit> . in addition, a specific conserved binding motif can be identified for only a pair of nsds: met <dig>  and met <dig> ; tyr <dig>  and tyr <dig> ; thr <dig>  and thr <dig> . moreover, peptide-protein interaction specific for each nsd completes the binding motif with cys <dig> , asn <dig> , asn <dig> & asp <dig> & thr <dig> . taken together, the differences observed within the binding motifs amongst the nsds offer possibilities of discrimination that may be exploited in a drug design strategy targeting the histone tail-binding site.

the post-set regulatory loop sits on top of the histone-peptide, stabilizing the complex and forcing the lysine substrate into the catalytic channel extending deep toward the co-factor-binding site. in all cases, the lysine substrate extends into the narrow channel connecting the co-factor-binding site in order to react and is anchored by two hydrogen bonds, except for nsd <dig> with h3k <dig> and h3k <dig> where the lysine substrate is bonded by a single hydrogen bond. this double-hydrogen bond is found in other lysine-hmtases and appears to be associated with catalytic efficiency. this observation is consistent with the peptide-bound structures of h3k9-hmtases  where the lys <dig> is stabilized by a pair of analogous hydrogen bonds  <cit> . a similar conserved double-hydrogen bond is observed in the structures of h4k20-setd <dig>  h3k4-setd <dig>  and h3k27-vset  <cit> . in nsd <dig>  the h3k <dig> lysine is anchored by two hydrogen bonds whereas the h4k <dig> lysine is strongly held in place by three hydrogen bonds. in addition, the h3k <dig> a.a. 32- <dig> peptide is stabilized by a network of ten hydrogen bonds compared to thirteen for the h4k <dig> a.a. 16- <dig> peptide . this observation is consistent with a more favorable binding energy of h4k <dig> a.a. 16- <dig> compared to the h3k <dig> a.a. 32- <dig> peptide . our data indicate that nsd3-ctd has comparably poor hmtase activities on h3k <dig> and h3k <dig>  which appear to be correlated with the lys <dig> and lys <dig> being anchored by only one hydrogen bond. overall, the stabilization of the lysine substrate is established by a pair of hydrogen bonds that tightly anchor the lysine substrate in the narrow catalytic channel, affecting catalytic efficiency .

CONCLUSIONS
our data suggest that the nsd members may not be exclusive to a single histone mark in vivo. we show that the ctds of nsd members can carry out pan-methylation of lysine substrates and generate k-me <dig>  k-me <dig>  and k-me <dig> species in vitro. however, in vivo cell-based assays have predominantly identified k-me <dig> or k-me <dig> species depending on the cellular context  <cit> . our molecular modelling data indicate that the binding-groove can equally accommodate k-me <dig> or k-me <dig> species. this is consistent with a regulatory mechanism distinct from the cd and carried out by the phd <dig> domain to control the localization and the degree of methylation by nsd members  <cit> . interestingly, the pwwp domain of the fission yeast set <dig> partner, pdp <dig>  controls set9-mediated h4k <dig> methylation and appears to directly interact with histones for set <dig> localization  <cit> . moreover, the sequence conservation is high between pdp1-pwwp and both pwwp domains of nsd <dig>  nsd <dig>  and nsd <dig>  <cit> . the hydrophobic residues in pdp1-pwwp responsible for the recognition of h4k <dig> marks are also conserved in the two nsd-pwwp domains  <cit> . like pdp <dig>  the nsd members may localize to chromatin through the assistance of pwwp domains. further analysis to elucidate the role of the pwwp domains in the nsd members will greatly improve our understanding of the regulation of histone-lysine methylations.
