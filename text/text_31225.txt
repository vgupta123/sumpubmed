BACKGROUND
transposable elements  represent a variable but often sizeable fraction of genomes  and critically shape their organization and function. most genomes studied to date contain te families that are currently active. for instance in humans, novel alu and line- <dig>  retrotransposon insertions can disrupt gene activity and cause genetic diseases  <cit> . in mice, iap retrotransposon insertions have been shown to account for over  <dig> % of spontaneous mutations  <cit> . this ongoing activity results in high levels of insertional polymorphism, even between individuals of the same population.

co-option of specific te functions by host genomes has led to several critical evolutionary innovations like adaptive immunity in vertebrates  <cit>  and placentation in mammals  <cit> . however, the general functional impact of novel te insertions remains unclear. for instance, views on novel retrotransposon insertions in humans range from considering them as essentially evolutionary neutral as long as they do not target exons  <cit>  to being important driving forces behind the evolution of new gene regulatory networks  <cit> . in support of the latter view, functional molecular studies have established that various active te families contain regulatory elements that affect transcription at neighboring genes or even beyond .

over the last decade, the availability of whole genome sequences and the development of next-generation sequencing methods have yielded large catalogs of specific te elements and have started to shed new light onto tes  <cit> . surveying te elements genome-wide and in larger populations is providing novel insights into their functional impact and evolutionary dynamics. for instance many tes show considerable stratification across populations  <cit>  and some have notable haplotypic structures compatible with recent, positive selection  <cit> . larger-scale te genotyping in more diverse population will provide a better understanding of their population genetics. large-scale te genotyping would also allow for association studies of te insertions with molecular  or organismal phenotypes which, in turn, would help us to understand their functional effects. the recent discovery of retrotransposition in human brain  <cit>  and tumors  <cit>  has also spawned numerous novel questions about retrotransposon biology beyond inherited germ line insertions. efficient genotyping methods will thus yield further insights into somatic retrotransposition. finally, from a more applied perspective, tes provide powerful genetic markers because of their abundance and dispersion across the whole genome. affordable and high throughput genotyping methods would be useful for the characterization of diversity in natural and selected populations as well as for marker-assisted selection in plant and animal breeding programs  <cit> .

historically, genotyping of a specific te has proceeded by site-specific pcr amplification across the insertion site or across the te-genome boundary . although it is cheap, this method is not convenient for high-throughput analysis when pcr products are resolved using gel electrophoresis. on the other end of the spectrum, genome resequencing can survey a large fraction of te insertions genome-wide  <cit> . it has proven to be useful for te discovery but, paradoxically, has comparatively poor genotyping accuracy  <cit> . it also remains expensive and therefore it is generally not applicable to the survey of many samples. building upon previous methods , several targeted sequencing methods have been developed over the last years . they have been instrumental in revealing the extent of te insertions and polymorphisms in humans  <cit> . these methods amplify te junctions by genome fragmentation, adapter ligation and pcr amplification, or by direct amplification using hemi-specific pcr. with regard to genotyping, they are more accurate than whole-genome sequencing  <cit> . however, owing to the nature of the enrichment scheme, they are restricted to the amplification of a specific te family. also, they might be blind to specific insertions with particular flanking sequence properties because they rely on specific sets of degenerate primers to amplify the te-genome junction  or use enzymatic digestion to create fragments containing te-genome junctions. moreover, targeted resequencing necessitates considerable sequencing depth in order to reliably detect the presence of a specific te insertion. finally, te genotyping could rely on snps around tes and presenting high linkage disequilibrium with the insertion allele so that they can be used as proxies to detect te insertions. based on this scheme, genotyping could be conducted in a high-throughput manner at very reasonable price because of the availability of snp array  technologies. focusing on l <dig> elements of the l1hs family in humans, we found that tagging snps likely exist for a majority of insertions  <cit> . however, we also observed that l1hs elements could not be systematically assayed by a standard snp array as it only comprised a minority of l1-tagging snps  <cit> . this is likely to be the case for other important te families as tes are usually masked during identification and selection of tagging snps.

here we demonstrate a highly accurate, automated and high-throughput te genotyping method and apply it to the genotyping of l <dig> and alu insertions in humans. it relies on high-throughput sequencing of multiplex, site-specific pcr amplification of tes of interest. sequencing reads obtained from pcr products are used to ensure product specificity and make reliable, read count-based, genotype calls. sequence information around the insertion site yields allelic information and can be used for haplotype analysis. the method is flexible, does not require lengthy optimization rounds and should be within reach of many laboratories owing to the growing availability and affordable costs of high-throughput sequencing. in principle, it can be used to genotype any structural variant that can be assayed by breakpoint pcr amplification  <cit> .

RESULTS
principles of read count-based genotyping
we describe the principle of the method as applied to the genotyping of te insertions . a set of te loci is assayed by multiplex pcr amplifications targeting the junctions between tes and their flanking genomic insertion sites. high multiplexing can be achieved by various  methods including the careful design of primers that allow for multiple pcr reactions in the same reagent volume and parallelization of pcr reactions using droplet or microfluidic technology. amplicon libraries are sequenced, and reads matching the targeted locations are counted: a high number of specific reads indicates that the corresponding pcr reaction amplified the targeted te junction and that the te was present whereas the absence of specific reads  indicates that the te was absent.fig.  <dig> principle of count-based genotyping of structural variation  and workflow of a genotyping experiment . a: genotyping of three polymorphic te insertion loci. gray and dotted boxes represent present and absent insertions, respectively. blue arrows represent pcr primers and orange lines depict sequencing reads



the workflow of a read count-based genotyping experiment  starts with the selection of loci of interest and the design of appropriate primers for each locus. several separate multiplex pcr libraries are then assembled so that primers used in the same reaction do not form strong dimers that would prevent homogenous amplification of the individual pcr reactions. here, we typically assembled libraries of  <dig> to  <dig> pcr reactions and used a commercial microfluidic chip to build up to  <dig> 10-plex to 50-plex libraries in parallel. the libraries obtained for each sample are then combined and subjected to a second round pcr that adds a barcode and the end adapter sequences required for high-throughput sequencing. sample-specific libraries are sequenced and demultiplexed. finally, the specific read count statistics are obtained by bioinformatics analysis and form the basis for making genotype calls.

automated allelic genotyping of l <dig> insertions
we first applied our method to the genotyping of l <dig> insertions. in order to distinguish individuals with homozygous insertion alleles  from heterozygous individuals, we adapted the standard scheme requiring two pcr reactions per insertion locus . we combined this binary presence/absence read-out scheme with our read count-based method to reliably and efficiently scale up the analysis over many sites and samples. the “e”  reaction uses site-specific primers in the flanks on each side of the insertion and the “g”  reaction uses an l1-specific primer at the 3’end of the element and the site-specific primer in the 3’ genomic flank of the insertion . on an electrophoresis gel, an allele that does not carry the l <dig> insertion yields a product for the e reaction and no product for the g reaction whereas an allele bearing the l <dig> insertion yields a product for the g reaction but generally no product for the e reaction because l <dig> insertions are long and prevent efficient amplification. together the two reactions can thus differentiate the three possible diallelic genotypes . the primers for the e and g reactions are tailed with universal sequences  to allow for the second round pcr that adds barcodes  and high-throughput sequencing adapters .fig.  <dig> primers and pcr reactions for allelic genotyping of an l <dig> element  and standard gel electrophoresis analysis of the e and g reaction products . a: the e reaction uses primers located in each of the l <dig> flanks and tests for the presence of an allele without the l <dig> insertion. the g reaction uses an l1-specific primer and the primer in the 3’ flank and tests for the presence of an allele bearing the l <dig> insertion. primers used in the first pcr  are tailed  so that the adapter  and index sequences can be added in a second round pcr . b: three possible diallelic genotypes based on the presence or absence of the e and g reaction products on an electrophoresis gel. black filled and empty boxes represent respectively, the presence and absence of a pcr product. the gray filled boxes  represent the  product from the e reaction that is generated in the presence of an allele bearing a short l <dig> insertion



we tested the method by genotyping  <dig> human-specific l <dig> insertions. we designed primer pairs flanking each targeted l <dig> insertion that we used in conjunction with a single l1-specific primer. the single l1-specific primer was identical across all l <dig> insertions since all targeted l <dig> insertions are of the same family  and have an identical 3’ end sequence. we then assembled  <dig> libraries  targeting  <dig> l <dig> insertions each  and assayed  <dig> samples in parallel using a fluidigm access array chip. we then used a second pcr to barcode the pooled products of the  <dig> libraries obtained for each sample  and sequenced the  <dig> samples in paired-end mode on a miseq illumina benchtop sequencer. read  <dig> proceeded from the primer in the 3’ l <dig> flank whereas read  <dig> proceeded from the primer in the 5’ flank  or the l1-specific primer . for each demultiplexed sample, we computationally sorted reads based on their locus of origin and reaction type  by matching the start of read  <dig> to each of the  <dig> 3’ flank primers and the start of read  <dig> to each of the  <dig> 5’ flank primers  or the l1-specific primer  . we then discarded reads that did not align to their targeted loci which allowed us to avoid counting reads that arose from unspecific amplification products.

note that l <dig> insertions are sometimes 5’ truncated and can be very short. in that case, the e reaction will yield a product despite the presence of the intervening insertion . when performing genotyping by gel electrophoresis, knowledge of the product size expected in the absence of the insertion is required to make a correct call and avoid misinterpreting the presence of a product as absence of the insertion. for read count-based genotyping, we introduced the following check: we identified reads spanning small insertions  by detecting l1-specific sequence in the sequencing reads arising from the e reaction and discarding them. l <dig> elements that required this additional check in order to be correctly genotyped typically were less than  <dig> bp long.

the specific read counts obtained for e reactions at each locus clearly clustered into two groups . the high and low read count clusters comprised, respectively, samples in which the targeted l <dig> insertion was absent on at least one allele , or present on both alleles . for most loci, the separation was more than  <dig> log <dig> units. g reactions also yielded well separated clusters . here, the high and low read count clusters comprised, respectively, samples in which the l1-bearing allele was present at least once  or was absent . the exact position of both clusters varied from locus to locus, owing to systematic differences in pcr amplification efficiency. we implemented a locus-specific, unsupervised clustering method to obtain automatic genotype calls .fig.  <dig> read counts, automatic genotype calls and validation results for the 60-loci libraries. a: specific read counts for e reactions for  <dig> samples at each of  <dig> l <dig> loci. blue and black circles represent, respectively, the present and absent calls made based on the clustering of read counts. crosses indicate genotypes with a quality score less than  <dig>  triangles  indicate genotypes that would be called “present”  because of high read count but that were called “absent” because the l <dig> sequence was detected in the reads . b: specific read counts obtained for e reactions for loci that passed quality control. green and red circles indicate, respectively, concordant and discordant calls for  <dig> loci that were validated individually using single-locus pcr reactions and gel electrophoresis. all calls were concordant. locus  <dig> was excluded from the analysis because the primers did not work. c: same as a but for the g libraries. d: same as b for  <dig> loci that passed quality control and that were individually validated. all calls were concordant



quality controls, validations and genotyping accuracy
we used the position and spread of the low and high read count clusters to automatically spot loci with potential genotyping problems . unusual cluster mean  signaled loci that did not amplify convincingly  or that failed clustering . we dropped  <dig> and  <dig> loci from the e and g libraries, respectively: for the e libraries,  <dig> loci showed poor clustering  and  <dig> locus had reads that did not map uniquely to the targeted site. for the g libraries,  <dig> loci showed poor clustering  and  <dig> loci had reads that did not map uniquely. one primer pair was found a posteriori not to work properly and was excluded from both libraries. in addition to characterizing each locus using statistical characteristics of the clusters, we also derived genotyping quality scores representing the confidence of each call given the observed read count and the underlying clusters . loci where many samples showed low quality scores overlapped with loci dropped based on poor cluster characteristics .fig.  <dig> read count cluster statistics and genotype quality scores for the 60-loci libraries. a: mean versus standard deviation of clusters obtained with the e libraries. black and blue circles indicate, respectively, low and high read count clusters. despite locus-to-locus variations, most clusters had similar means and standard deviations. we manually set thresholds  at  <dig>  and  <dig>  , which dropped out locus  <dig> , loci  <dig> and  <dig>  and locus  <dig> . b: same as a for the g libraries. we dropped locus  <dig>  and loci  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . c: histograms of genotype quality scores obtained for the e libraries. scores below  <dig>  are indicated as crosses in fig. 3a, c. d: same as c for the g libraries



we obtained allelic genotype calls for loci for which both the e and g reactions passed quality checks . we had previously performed individual pcr and gel electrophoresis for  <dig> of these loci  <cit> . we thus compared the read count-based genotypes obtained here with the genotypes calls obtained with the standard gel-based method: for the e libraries, all  <dig> tested genotype calls  were concordant . for the g libraries, all  <dig> tested genotype calls  were concordant .

further, we aimed to assess the accuracy of our read-count based genotyping method on an independent dataset and set out to genotype  <dig> additional l <dig> insertions across  <dig> samples .  <dig> and  <dig> loci passed quality control for the e and g libraries, respectively . to compare with the read count-based genotypes , we performed individual pcr reactions and gel electrophoresis analysis for all  <dig> loci . we found  <dig> genotyping errors across the e and g libraries. all but one were found at locus  <dig> . the four samples that were miscalled in the e reaction of locus  <dig> actually had a high read count but the corresponding tags did not perfectly align to the target location so that their specific read count was low. read tags are extracted from the beginning of reads and are used to ensure specificity of amplification products . upon realignment of the tags to the genome, we found that the problem was caused by a known 1-bp deletion variant  in these four samples specifically . allowing for slight misalignments of the tags to the target location hence resulted in a correct genotype call in this case. we also examined the error at locus  <dig>  and found that it was caused by an error in primer design. the 3’-flank primer overlapped a known snp which prevented the efficient amplification of the e reaction on the allele that did not carry the l <dig> insertion .

thus the concordance between read-count based genotypes and genotypes obtained from standard, individual pcrs was  <dig>  % for both the e and g libraries . these results demonstrate the very high accuracy of read count-based genotyping.

automated genotyping of alu insertions demonstrates assay scalability
we aimed to assess the flexibility and scalability of our method and set out to genotype another type of polymorphic transposable element. we focused on the currently active aluyb <dig> subfamily of alu elements. alu insertions play an important role in genome biology as they create genome diversity, influence gene expression and can generate disease-causing mutations  <cit> .

we asked if pcr reactions performed in the access array could sustain higher levels of pcr multiplexing. we designed primers and assembled them in 47- and 57-plex reactions, assaying a total of  <dig> alu insertion loci across  <dig> dna samples . despite higher multiplexing, sequencing libraries did not show unspecific products when analyzed by gel electrophoresis . upon sequencing, the vast majority of loci showed excellent separation between high and low read count clusters for both the e and g libraries , allowing us to make  <dig>  high quality genotype calls .

we compared our genotype calls with calls previously obtained by the  <dig> genome project   <cit> . focusing on high-quality calls from the 1000gp , we identified  <dig>  and  <dig>  discordant calls in the e and g libraries, respectively. upon individual pcr validation, we found that only  <dig> calls in the e library and  <dig> calls in the g library were actual genotyping errors in our experiment . this confirms the very high accuracy  of our genotyping method . finally, only  <dig> loci  and  <dig> loci  were eliminated upon quality check of the e and g libraries, respectively and the drop-out rate for combined  calls was  <dig> %. the reasons for dropping loci were either lower separation between read count clusters or read alignment to multiple locations in the genome. however, when compared to individual pcr validations, most of the eliminated loci showed error-free genotype calls , indicating that our criteria for quality assessment were quite strict and that the drop-out rate could be decreased further.

in conclusion, high accuracy levels and low drop-out rates were maintained at higher levels of pcr multiplexing. importantly, we designed primers automatically and assembled them in multiplex reactions without recursive optimization rounds, highlighting the efficiency of the method. as we used  <dig> out of  <dig> channels of the access array to build the  <dig> libraries , these results show that the method can scale up to over  <dig>  loci  across  <dig> samples on a single access array chip.

phasing and haplotype analysis of l <dig> insertions
in addition to accurate genotyping, many potentially powerful applications require the phase of variants to be known, i.e. to determine which of the two alleles at a heterozygous locus bears the variant, such as te insertion in the case of l <dig> and alu genotyping. this is critical for analyzing the haplotypic structure around structural variants. the sequence immediately flanking the 3’ end of the insertion that is captured by the pcr reactions and is contained in sequencing read  <dig> can be used to determine the phase of insertions. specifically, we looked for known snps in this sequence  and for each sample, we called heterozygous snps in the sequencing reads from the e and g reactions separately. we then compared these calls to the known snp alleles to identify the insertion-bearing allele.

the hapmap samples used in our experiments were included in the  <dig> genome project  and we set out to phase heterozygous samples in our validation  experiment with the snp data provided for these samples by the 1000gp. the length of the sequence between the end of the 3’ flank primer and the l <dig> 3’ end varied between  <dig> and  <dig> bp  across the  <dig> loci and contained from  <dig> to  <dig> snps  as identified and genotyped by the 1000gp project. mining the snp calls provided by the 1000gp, we found that one third  of all heterozygous l <dig> samples  had at least one heterozygous snp in the accessible l <dig> flanking sequence and could thus potentially be phased. upon snp calling in the e and g reactions separately, all of the heterozygous l <dig> samples with at least one heterozygous snps could be successfully phased: the snp alleles called in the e and g reactions always matched the two alleles called by the 1000gp. moreover, in the case of more than one heterozygous snp in the flanking sequence, each snp resulted in the same phase call, demonstrating the reliability of the procedure.

we used the phase information obtained here to analyze the haplotypic structure around a small set of l <dig> insertions. haplotypic structures can provide useful information on the evolutionary dynamics of genetic variants: we previously detected significant extended haplotype homozygosity  around particular l <dig> insertions, compatible with the signature left by recent and rapid positive selection events. to ensure a high genotyping accuracy, we had genotyped these l1s using individual, site-specific pcrs and gel electrophoresis analysis. because this standard genotyping approach cannot yield l <dig> phases, however, we had to restrict our analysis to homozygous samples only. here, we repeated the ehh analysis around  <dig> l <dig> insertions that we included in the 22-loci experiment and that had been previously analyzed. we used l <dig> genotypes and phase information obtained with our sequencing-based method, resulting in the additional inclusion of phased heterozygous samples in the analysis. we included the  <dig> samples assayed for the validation experiment and performed read count-based genotyping on  <dig> additional samples to obtain a cohort of  <dig> samples. for each locus, the phase information allowed us to include between  <dig> and  <dig> additional  samples in the analysis . out of the  <dig> l <dig> insertions assayed here,  <dig> were successfully genotyped and phased and two showed strong differences in ehh signals obtained for the alleles with  and without  l <dig> insertion, reflecting haplotypic differences on both alleles . they indeed correspond to  <dig> of the  <dig> l1s identified in our previous study  and that might have been under positive selection in recent human evolution.fig.  <dig> ehh analysis in the  <dig> kb regions around  <dig> selected l <dig> insertions  using the genotypes and phase information obtained from  <dig> ceu samples. p1_m_061510_1_ <dig>  and p1_mei_1280&p2_mei_ <dig>  show clear haplotype differences between the l1-bearing allele  and the allele without insertion . the remaining insertions  do not show clear haplotype differences between both alleles



discussion
we have presented a large-scale genotyping method for insertions and other types of genetic variants that can be assayed by pcr. the information yielded by standard electrophoresis analysis of pcr reactions is restricted to the presence and size of one  product. instead, we used high-throughput sequencing as a pcr read-out method. we showed that the sequence information and quantitative read counts obtained by sequencing allows for highly accurate, robust, flexible and large-scale genotyping as well as haplotype analysis. when compared to individual pcr reactions resolved on agarose gels, the concordance of the method as applied to l <dig> genotyping was above  <dig>  %. we showed that improved primer design can further increase concordance, in particular taking into account known snps when designing primer sequence. for comparison, we and others previously estimated that the accuracy of l <dig> genotyping based on whole-genome resequencing or targeted resequencing  was around  <dig> %  <cit> . notably, we have previously shown that this accuracy level can confound genetic analyses , highlighting the need for highly accurate genotyping methods.

l <dig> insertions are long  structural variants . alu insertions, on the other hand are short  elements that are often found in gene regions and sometimes nested in other repetitive elements. they thus represent a challenging and interesting test for our sequencing-based method. we profiled a set of alu insertions using 50-plex pcr reactions and showed that our method can scale up to over  <dig>  loci  without increasing drop-out rate or compromising genotyping accuracy. smaller indels  could be assayed with a single e library as both alleles  will amplify similarly and could thus be differentiated via detection of an actual insertion tag . importantly, all the primers in our libraries were designed and assembled in a single round, without iterative optimization.

the drop-out rate in read count-based genotyping varied between  <dig> %  and  <dig> % . a common reason for locus exclusion was excessive read count variability . this was caused by unreliable pcr reactions  or failed statistical clustering . the former can be addressed experimentally by redesigning primers or by regrouping primers into different libraries, since primer pairs usually  worked when used in single pcr reactions . improved approaches for predicting primer interactions will thus be helpful in routinely designing larger multiplex libraries. cases of failed statistical clustering can be addressed by refining the computational analysis method. indeed, we observed several loci with an inflated standard deviation caused by a small number of samples with an intermediate read count. improving the handling of such outliers using refined clustering methods could thus decrease dropout rate without compromising accuracy. finally, note that the dropout rate for standard genotyping by individual pcr reactions analyzed on gels was smaller compared to read count-based genotyping, yet it was significant: for the 22-loci experiment, for instance, we had to redesign primers for  <dig> loci, because they produced multiple products that did not allow for unambiguous genotyping by electrophoresis analysis . importantly, the original primers actually yielded genotypes with the specific read count-based method, highlighting the benefit of using sequence information for genotyping.

the costs of materials and reagents for read count-based genotyping are dominated by sequencing costs . the cost per genotype thus decreases with the number of loci and samples assayed. in contrast, the cost per genotype using standard genotyping on agarose gels is fixed and mostly determined by the costs of dna polymerase. based on the use of the access array for the preparation of 10-plex libraries, we considered the costs of experiments of various scales. whereas the cost per genotype was about  <dig> times higher for read count-based genotyping compared to standard genotyping in small scale experiments, it was more than twice cheaper when making full use of the chip . increasing the multiplexing of individual libraries  reduces costs proportionally and results in dramatic economies of scale . however, increasing multiplexing usually requires further optimization in library design. the automatic library preparation system  is the second cost-determining factor of read count-based genotyping and it might seem advantageous to replace it with manual preparation. the very small volumes of enzymatic reagents required in the access array , however, makes the manual solution cheaper for small scale experiments only . two factors were excluded from the analysis: primer synthesis costs will be higher for read count-based genotyping, because the required primers are longer and a second-round pcr with barcoding primers is necessary. second, we did not take into account labor costs. if labor costs were included, the much shorter handling time of automated library preparation compared to standard genotyping on gels could greatly shift the balance in favor of read count-based genotyping. in conclusion, read count-based genotyping can be cost- and time-effective for medium scale experiments already, i.e. targeting a few hundred loci across a few dozen of samples for instance.

finally, we summarize important practical considerations for library design, preparation and analysis:amplicon size is not fixed and can be adapted to the target application. in the 60-loci experiment, we used  <dig> bp amplicons but shorter amplicons can be used. the minimal length is determined by the length of the tag used to verify read specificity . in the 22-loci experiment, on the other hand, we used  <dig> bp amplicons to increase the number of sequenced snps and thus improve haplotyping.

it is critical, however, that amplicons in a particular multiplex library be homogeneous in size because we observed that the presence of shorter amplicons compromised the homogeneous amplification of libraries. we observed that this effect was much stronger than having primers with variable gc content . as a matter of fact, we allowed for a wide range of gc content  but strongly constrained amplicon size differences to a maximum of  <dig> bp .

the 2-round pcr scheme is used to add sample-specific barcodes and harness the huge throughput of a sequencing run. it also permits the use of shorter  primers because pcr  <dig> primers then do not have to contain sequencing adapters. this scheme also improves multiplexing, because the second pcr relies on a single pair of sequences , which was proposed to reduce amplification bias  <cit> .

we systematically varied the number of pcr cycles but concluded that fine-tuning is not critical. indeed, we observed that increasing the number of pcr  <dig> cycles increased read count variability , which confirmed the assumption underlying the tailed multiplex pcr method. however, we also observed that increasing the number of pcr  <dig> cycles increased read counts for absent amplicons , most probably by amplification of residual contamination. thus the respective number of cycles for the first and second pcr cannot be set arbitrarily and represents a trade-off between two different sources of read count variability.

independent, experimental validation of primer pairs was necessary for only  <dig> loci in the 22-loci libraries as they did not show any specific reads for any samples upon sequencing. this could have been due to the absence of the corresponding amplicon in all samples  or to the primers failing to prime the pcr reaction. to rule out the latter, we validated the primer pairs using additional dna samples and successfully amplified the target from at least one of them, confirming that the primer pair worked as expected . such independent primer validation, however, is mitigated as the number of samples grows larger since the probability of including at least one sample comprising the target  increases.



CONCLUSIONS
we present an efficient method to perform high-throughput genotyping of tes and other types of structural variants. we provide a detailed demonstration of how to design, build and analyze sequencing libraries that allow for large-scale genotyping studies. applying our method to the genotyping of l <dig> insertions in human samples, we show that it is as accurate as “gold standard” site-specific pcr assays. however, it remainscost-effective and it is cheaper than standard methods for medium and large scale experiments. however, it remainscost-effective and it is cheaper than standard methods for medium and large scale experiments. we demonstrate the flexibility of the method by genotyping a shorter te  and show that it can scale up without compromising genotyping accuracy or increasing the drop-out rate. as exemplified by our analysis of the haplotypic structure around l <dig> insertions, this novel method can benefit a wide range of applications including high-throughput, routine genotyping and functional studies of tes and structural variants.
