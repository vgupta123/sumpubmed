BACKGROUND
podophyllum hexandrum royle, commonly referred to as the himalayan/indian mayapple, is an endangered perennial herb belonging to the family berberidaceae, which is distributed on the lower slopes of the himalayas in scrub and forest, from afghanistan to central china
 <cit> . roots and rhizomes of p. hexandrum contain lignans, such as podophyllotoxin and other related aryltetralin lignans
 <cit> , which are present in podophyllum spp. but are not restricted to this genus. extracts of podophyllum spp. have been used by diverse cultures as antidotes against poisons and as cathartic, purgative, anthelmintic, vesicant and suicidal agents
 <cit> . a crude resin extract of podophyllum spp., podophyllin, was included in the us pharmacopoeia in  <dig>  and this resin has been prescribed to treat venereal warts. podophyllotoxin has been used as the starting compound for the production of the semi-synthetic drugs etoposide , teniposide  and etopophos, which are used to treat lung and testicular cancers
 <cit> , leukaemia and rheumatoid arthritis
 <cit> . a recent review
 <cit>  stated that species containing podophyllotoxin were traditionally used as folk-remedies in china, japan, india and the united states to treat several illnesses, including gout, tuberculosis, syphilis, warts and various tumors. the indian species, p. hexandrum, contains three times more podophyllotoxin than its american counterpart, p. peltatum, which contains other lignans, such as α- and β-peltatins
 <cit> . however, peltatins do not contribute to the anti-cancer properties of the plant
 <cit> .

to meet the commercial demand, podophyllotoxin has been extracted from the rhizomes of p. hexandrum and p. peltatum collected in the wild. the chemical synthesis of podophyllotoxin is possible, but not economically feasible
 <cit> . therefore, large quantities of rhizomes have been collected indiscriminately to meet the ever-increasing demands of modern medicine. severe habitat destruction and over-collection has created acute depletion in the population of this herb. together with a lack of organized cultivation, this has led to p. hexandrum being classified as a critically endangered species in the himalayan region
 <cit> .

in addition to this genus, other plants, including linum album, juniperus chinensis and callitris drummondii, have been investigated for the in vitro production of podophyllotoxin and its derivatives
 <cit> . however, the production of podophyllotoxin using cell cultures may not be sufficient for biotechnological production systems
 <cit> .

the complete sequences of dirigent protein oxidase , secoisolariciresinol dehydrogenase  and cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase  from p. hexandrum have been deposited in the national centre for biotechnology information . lignan biosynthesis involves mechanisms for enantioselective dimerization. dpo affects the selective coupling of the coniferyl alcohol radical to produce -pinoresinol
 <cit>  and pinoresinol reductase converts pinoresinol to secoisolariciresinol via lariciresinol
 <cit> . then, -secoisolariciresinol is converted to -matairesinol by sdg
 <cit> . matairesinol is a starting point for the biosynthesis of podophyllotoxin. one possible pathway is that matairesinol is converted to yatein and then to podophyllotoxin via deoxypodophyllotoxin
 <cit> . another direct pathway to podophyllotoxin from matairesinol via thujaplicatin has been proposed
 <cit> . although the podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway is reasonably well characterized and several cdnas have been reported, the transformation from matairesinol to podophyllotoxin involves hydroxylation, methylations and methylenedioxy bridge formation, and these late steps are yet to be characterized. a recent report revealed two cytochrome p <dig> enzymes in p. hexandrum and p. peltatum that are capable of converting -matairesinol into -pluviatolide by catalyzing the formation of a methylenedioxy bridge
 <cit> .

de novo transcriptome analysis of next-generation sequencing data is an appropriate technique for identifying unknown genes in non-model organisms
 <cit> . expressed sequence tag  sequencing, which excludes non-coding and repetitive dna components, is a cost-effective and frequently used strategy to analyze the transcriptome. here, we sequenced the transcriptome of p. hexandrum cell culture using the  <dig> gs-flx titanium technology, assembled the raw reads using three assemblers, and chose an assembler with the best performance. finally, functional annotation, fpkm value, domain analysis, transcription factors  and simple sequence repeat  identification, and mirna targeted transcript identification, were determined. domains from the identified transcripts that could represent downstream genes encoding enzymes that catalyze the late steps in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis were also identified. the data from this study will form the basis for future studies towards the isolation and characterization of the podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway genes from p. hexandrum.

RESULTS
 <dig> sequencing of the mayapple cell culture transcriptome
clonally amplified cdna library beads obtained from emulsion-based clonal amplification  reactions were subjected to two experimental runs on a pico titre plate  for sequencing using roche  <dig> gs flx pyrosequencing chemistry. a total of  <dig> , <dig> raw reads  were obtained, and the low quality reads, adapters and primer sequences were removed using prinseq
 <cit> . after quality filtration and adapter trimming of raw reads,  <dig> , <dig> high quality  reads with an average read length of 138 bp was obtained. the high quality reads were uniqued and mapped to rfam, non coding rna database. approximately, 50% filtered reads were obtained and used for further analysis.

p. hexandrum
comparison between default and optimized parameters of newbler
here we present a simple workflow for  <dig> sequencing, assembly, annotation and other analyses . newbler is frequently used in de novo pyrosequencing projects
 <cit> . the comparative denovo assembly was carried out using newbler with default and optimized parameters
 <cit> . the optimized parameter generated  <dig>  assembled sequences, comprising  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlets with an n <dig> of  <dig> and  <dig> for contigs and singlets respectively. newbler with optimized parameters gave the best results in terms of the numbers of assembled contigs and singlet, n <dig>  mean contig/singlets length and total bases of contigs /singlets  . additional file
 <dig>  shows the distribution of contig lengths generated by newbler using default and optimized parameters respectively. further analysis of the singlet generated by newbler default assembly were excluded because their mean length was below 200 bp.

functional annotation of assembled transcripts and determination of fpkm values
the annotation of transcripts was carried out using green plants of non-redundant  protein database at ncbi by blastx
 <cit> . blastx resulted in the annotation of  <dig>  contigs out of  <dig>  assembled contigs obtained using newbler default parameters  whereas  <dig>  transcripts from among  <dig>  contigs and  <dig>  singlet generated using newbler optimized parameters . using default parameters, transcripts showed significant similarity with p.trichocarpa followed by oryza sativa, ricinus communis and so forth,  while, using optimized parameters, significant similarity was achieved with m. truncatula, followed by glycine max, sorghum bicolor, p. trichocarpa and others . go assignments
 <cit>  were used to classify the functions of the predicted transcript contigs to determine the e-value distribution, sequence similarity distribution, evidence code distribution of sequences, evidence code distribution of blast hits, annotation score distribution, annotation distribution and go-level distribution of transcripts generated by default  and optimized newbler assembly . the go annotation of transcripts from newbler default and optimized assemblies are represented in additional file
 <dig> and additional file
 <dig> respectively. go-level sequence distribution for biological processes, molecular functions and cellular components of the transcript contigs and singlet generated by newbler default and optimized assembly are shown in figure 
 <dig> . digital expression profiling by fpkm of each transcript generated from newbler using default and optimized parameters assembly were also determined .

to identify the biological pathways that are active in p. hexandrum cell culture, we mapped the annotated sequences to the reference canonical pathways in kegg
 <cit> . among the annotated sequences generated by newbler using default and optimized parameters,  <dig> and  <dig> unique non-redundant sequences were involved in a particular kegg pathway of which  <dig> and  <dig> unique sequences could be assigned to secondary metabolism respectively .

protein domains encoded by the p. hexandrum transcriptome that may represent genes involved in podophyllotoxin biosynthesis
we were interested in probable podophyllotoxin pathway genes that could be identified from the transcriptome, therefore conserved domains database , pfam, and tigr databases were searched for domains encoding cads, monooxygenases, peroxidases , pinoresinol reductases, dpos, sdgs, and methyl transferases. our search identified transcripts coding for domains of cad, sdg, monooxygenase, pod, methyl transferase, nadb rossmann superfamily, flavin utilizing monooxygenases superfamily, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase methyltransferase  like superfamily, isoprene-c2-like reductase  like superfamily, cytochrome oxidase  superfamily and oxidoreductase q <dig>  superfamily . according to the hypothetical scheme of podophyllotoxin pathway
 <cit> , matairesinol is converted to podophyllotoxin by two consecutive methyl group additions forming a compound like yatein. we were also interested in finding methyl transferases that can transfer two methyl groups to the same substrate at the same time. a uroporphyrinogen iiic methyl transferase from p. hexandrum was identified in our previous studies, which is known to function in transferring two methyl groups from s-adenosyl-l-methionine  to its substrate
 <cit> . therefore, in addition to finding sam dependent methyl transferases, we also identified transcripts encoding uro-d cims domains.

combining kaas-kegg pathway analysis with domain searching for phenylpropanoid and probable downstream podophyllotoxin pathway genes
blastx analysis and kaas-kegg pathway mapping of transcripts from newbler default and optimized parameter identified cdnas encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase , hydroxyl cinnamoyl transferase , cinnamate-4-hydroxylase , 4-coumarate ligase , 4-coumarate coa ligase , cinnamoyl reductase , cad, sinapyl alcohol dehydrogenase , β-glucosidase  and pod as being involved in the phenylpropanoid pathway. podophyllotoxin pathway is hypothesized to start with cad converting coniferaldehyde to coniferyl alcohol, which then undergoes dirigent-mediated coupling to form pinoresinol. specific reductases, dehydrogenases and methyl transferases are then believed to convert pinoresinol to podophyllotoxin. we surveyed the cdd results for cdnas with domains that may represent genes of this pathway and identified transcripts containing phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase , sdgs, monooxygenases, sam dependent methyl transferases and uro-d cims-like domains. a scheme has been presented combining the blastx annotation, kaas-kegg mapping and domain search for phenylpropanoid pathway transcripts and transcripts with domains that may be part of podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway .

transcription factors related to secondary metabolism
controlled transcription of biosynthetic genes is an important mechanism for regulating secondary metabolite production in plant cells
 <cit> . certain tfs are known to be involved in the regulation of secondary metabolism, such as r2r3-myb, basic helix-loop-helix  proteins like crmyc <dig>  ap2/erf family proteins, wrky, nac, dof, bzip, hd-zip, and tfiiia zinc finger tfs. we identified  <dig> transcripts from newbler default assembly  and  <dig> transcripts from optimized parameter assembly  that may encode tfs . amongst them, notable transcripts were ap2-erebp, nac, bhlh, myb or myb related, bzip, mterf, wrky, c2c2-co-like and c2c2-dof. a number of plant myb tfs regulating the phenylpropanoid biosynthetic pathway, identified from many species, including arabidopsis, apple, grape, maize, petunia and snapdragon, most of which are r2r3-myb tfs
 <cit>  can be correlated with our study as  <dig> transcripts coding for myb or myb related tfs have been identified from the optimized newbler assembly. again, r2r3-myb transcription factor myb <dig> in a. thaliana has been shown to function as a flavonol specific activator of flavonoid biosynthesis
 <cit> . transcriptional regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis, a major branch of phenylpropanoid pathway, controlled by a set of r2r <dig> myb transcription factors, have been reported in several plants such as prunus persica, epimedium sagittatum as well
 <cit> . other than this tf,  <dig> transcripts coded for bhlh tfs have been identified here. the bhlh-domain of the maize r-gene is reported to participate in anthocyanin formation and serve as a link between flavonoid formation and histone modification
 <cit> . amongst the diverse functions, bhlh transcription factors also regulate the biosynthetic pathway of flavonoids, in several plant species
 <cit> .  <dig> dof family tf has been identified in our analyses. atdof <dig> is known to influence phenylpropanoid metabolism in an environmental and tissue-specific manner by positively regulating the production of hydroxycinnamic acids in the hypocotyl and flower buds, and negatively regulating flavonoid biosynthesis in pollen grains
 <cit> . together, tfs identified here and related to the phenylpropanoid pathway can be explored further in the regulation of podophyllotoxin biosynthesis.

in silico ssr marker identification
ssrs can be divided into genomic ssrs and est-ssrs. est-ssrs are more evolutionary conserved than noncoding sequences and therefore have a relatively high transferability
 <cit> . next-generation sequencing has identified est-ssrs in many plant species
 <cit> . however, there have been no reports of est-ssrs in p. hexandrum to date.

ssrs were identified with misa search tool , which is based on the criteria that a dinucleotide or a trinucleotide pattern should appear at least six times, and tetra, penta and hexa nucleotide patterns should appear five times each . ssr distribution and ssr mining of transcripts identified a total of  <dig>  ssrs from  <dig>  transcripts, with  <dig> transcripts containing more than one ssr. the most abundant repeat type was dinucleotides  and the dominant tandem repeat motifs were  <dig> and  <dig> representing  <dig> % and  <dig> % respectively.

transcriptome wide survey of mirna targets in p. hexandrum cell cultures
mirnas are known to regulate many developmental and effector genes at the posttranscriptional level
 <cit> . using oligonucleotide arrays, mirnas have been shown to be differentially expressed between tissues and during the maturation of the fruit in the grapevine
 <cit> . wong et al. <cit> , predicted three wood related genes, flavonol synthase-like, xyloglucan fucosyltransferase and glucan synthase-like genes to be the targets of mir <dig>  mir <dig> and mir <dig>  respectively, and suggested that these mirnas might be directly involved in regulation of the phenylpropanoid pathway and hemicellulose biosynthesis pathway. downregulation of flavonol synthase by mir <dig> would redirect the precursor 4-coumaroyl coa to lignin biosynthesis.

we identified precursor and mature mirnas in the p. hexandrum cell culture transcriptome, by searching the contigs and singlet in the public mirna database 
 <cit> . transcripts targeted by mirnas that are possibly related to phenylpropanoid and podophyllotoxin biosynthesis include cytochrome b <dig>  cytochrome p <dig> like, cell wall associated hydrolase, cell wall associated protein, laccase, and cytochrome f. deoxypodophyllotoxin 6-hydroxylase is a cytochrome p <dig> dependent monooxygenase, that catalyzes the introduction of a hydroxyl group in position  <dig> of deoxypodophyllotoxin
 <cit> . a cytochrome p <dig> protein is known to catalyze the biosynthesis of a lignan, - sesamin, by forming two methylenedioxy bridges
 <cit> . laccases have auxiliary roles in stereoselective coupling to 8-8′ linked lignans
 <cit> .

comparative qrt-pcr of selected phenylpropanoid pathway genes in cell culture, callus and rhizome and podophyllotoxin accumulation in p. hexandrum cell culture
podophyllotoxin content in p. hexandrum rhizome is known to vary from 4% to 10% in reference to age, altitude, net photosynthetic rate, stomatal conductance, carbon uptake and number of leaves
 <cit> . green calli were found to have 40–50 μg/g podophyllotoxin which were used to generate cell suspension culture. enhanced accumulation of podophyllotoxin was observed from 3 day old cell culture and increased up to 12 day  as noted by hplc analysis . however, no significantly increased accumulation was observed till 18 days. hence, we chose to compare relative gene expression profile of selected phenylpropanoid pathway transcripts amongst the calli, 12 day old cell culture, and the rhizome. transcripts of cad identified here, cad <dig>  cad <dig>  and cad <dig> share sequence similarity to arabidopsis cad <dig>  cad <dig>  and cad <dig> respectively as identified by blastx analysis. primers were designed from transcript contigs for qrt-pcr analysis . pal in 12 days cell culture shows  <dig>  fold upregulation with respect to the callus, while upregulation of pal expression levels in rhizome is insignificant . c4h is upregulated in the cell culture and the rhizome by  <dig> and  <dig>  folds respectively in comparison to that of callus. the high fpkm value of c4h in the 12 day cell culture samples may correlate with this observation . furthermore, upregulation of cad  <dig> , and  <dig> can be correlated as well with the fpkm value on the higher side.

CONCLUSIONS
this report comprises a large, assembled and functionally annotated high throughput genomic resource for p. hexandrum. our efforts to unravel the probable genes related to the podophyllotoxin biosynthetic pathway using the next-generation whole transcriptome sequencing of p. hexandrum identified almost all the known members of the phenylpropanoid pathway. the annotated transcripts represent a useful resource for subsequent isolation of podophyllotoxin pathway genes in p. hexandrum. in addition to pathway identification, the identification of est-ssrs as molecular markers will be useful for conservation of p. hexandrum, which is an endangered species.
