BACKGROUND
crisprs  have been detected in approximately 85% of archaeal and 50% of bacterial genomes  <cit> . they are considered a means of prokaryotic adaptive immunity against bacteriophages  <cit> , which are major determinants of prokaryotic abundance, diversity and community structure  <cit> . crisprs consist of conserved repeats separated by variable spacers, the latter representing incorporated fragments of viral or plasmid dna that specify immunity upon subsequent encounters  <cit> . many crisprs are associated with cas gene arrays, which can be classified into three major types and ten subtypes  <cit>  and are considered essential for crispr function. the activity of crispr-cas systems proceeds in three stages: the acquisition of protospacer sequences from foreign genetic elements and their integration into the crispr array, constitutive transcription of the array, and target interference through transcribed crrna  <cit> . in response, phages have developed mechanisms to evade crispr action , suggesting a co-evolutionary arms race between bacteria and phages.

comparative genomics has given insight into crisprs from actinobacteria
 <cit> , firmicutes
 <cit> , cyanobacteria
 <cit> , enterobacteria  <cit> , and archaea
 <cit> . in addition, mathematical modeling has presented important concepts about crispr dynamics during phage-bacteria interactions  <cit> . most of what is known about crisprs has been derived from pathogenic or industrially relevant bacteria such as salmonella
 <cit>  and streptococcus
 <cit> . in the case of environmental bacteria, it has been shown that crisprs are widespread in cyanobacteria except for the major marine lineages prochlorococcus and synechococcus
 <cit> . in freshwater cyanobacteria, crisprs were used to illustrate specific host-cyanophage interactions  <cit> . furthermore, crisprs have been linked to host-phage co-evolution, community structuring and biogeographic patterns in microbial mats  <cit> , acidophilic biofilms  <cit> , and hot spring microbiota  <cit> .

crisprs also control genetic exchange  <cit>  and intraspecies recombination  <cit> , hence mediating evolutionary processes  <cit> . they may also regulate gene expression via crrnas  <cit>  and ‘self-targeting spacers’ that match elements in the host genome  <cit> . crispr activity has also been linked to dna repair  <cit>  and can affect various bacterial phenotypes including biofilm formation  <cit> , swarming motility  <cit> , and pathogenicity  <cit> . despite the insights afforded by these studies, the distribution, diversity and functional roles of crispr-cas systems among closely related environmental bacteria remain largely unknown.

in the present study, we analyzed crispr-cas and prophage content in  <dig> salinispora strains from seven global collection sites. this actinomycete genus has a pan-tropical distribution in marine sediments  <cit>  and is comprised of three closely related species; the cosmopolitan s. arenicola and the regionally confined sister taxa s. pacifica and s. tropica
 <cit> . the species have been further divided into 16s rrna phylotypes , with the highest diversity in s. pacifica and the lowest in s. tropica
 <cit> 
. the genus is recognized for the production of diverse secondary metabolites  <cit> , with the associated biosynthetic pathways showing evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer  <cit> .

the diversity and distribution of crispr-cas systems in salinispora spp. was investigated to  assess the role of crisprs in phage defense,  characterize past interactions with foreign genetic elements,  elucidate linkages between crispr features and salinispora microdiversity, and  identify biogeographic signatures in crispr and prophage content. the detected diversity of crispr-cas systems, including spacers that match foreign genetic elements, supports a role in host immunity. spacer arrays illustrated recurring encounters with related phages as well as geographically confined mges. these findings suggest the presence of complex crispr-mediated interactions between salinispora spp. and foreign genetic elements that may influence the ecology and evolution of this broadly distributed marine actinomycete genus.

RESULTS
crispr content in  <dig> salinisporastrains
genome sequences from  <dig> salinispora strains derived from seven global collection sites were analyzed for crispr-cas content . in total,  <dig> crispr loci were detected, with an average of  <dig>  per strain  but considerable among strain variability, ranging between  <dig> and  <dig> . unlike many genera for which multiple genome sequences are available, all  <dig> salinispora strains harbored crisprs, suggesting they are an ecologically relevant feature of this genus. salinispora crispr content exceeded the average reported for mesophilic bacteria  <cit>  and marine bacterial metagenomes  <cit>  and accounted for up to  <dig> % of some genomes, which is approximately a third of the reported ‘prokaryotic maximum’  <cit> . crisprs were concentrated in genomic islands, which represent the major regions of gene acquisition in salinispora spp.  <cit> . prior evidence of extensive horizontal gene transfer in salinispora spp.  <cit> , coupled with the ubiquity of crispr-cas systems detected in the present study, suggests an ongoing dynamic between crispr-mediated immunity and the acquisition of foreign genetic material.table  <dig>

the  <dig> crispr loci contained  <dig> spacers, of which 68% were observed only once across all genomes. extensive differences in spacer content were detected among strains isolated at the same time from the same site , suggesting that spatiotemporal encounters with mobile genetic elements  may be highly variable. on average, s. arenicola and s. tropica contained more spacers per strain than s. pacifica, however, the numbers varied greatly among strains within each species .

diversity and evolution of cas array subtypes
the  <dig> salinispora strains contained  <dig> cas arrays , all of which can be classified as type i based on the inclusion of a cas <dig> gene  <cit> . cas arrays could be further grouped into six subtypes , of which five occurred in all three species and one  was only observed in s. arenicola. in total, 60% of the crisprs were associated with cas arrays , with up to five different array subtypes in some strains . three of these subtypes  have been previously characterized  <cit> , with the most common  occurring in  <dig> strains. almost two-thirds of the i-e arrays were associated with paired loci, i.e., two crisprs  flanking internalized cas genes, as often observed in archaea
 <cit> . eleven strains contained two i-e or i-c arrays . blast analysis of the associated cas <dig> genes indicated that the two arrays in a given strain were acquired as independent events from different sources based on sequence similarities to homologs in different actinomycetes . in all three species, the gc content of i-c arrays was lower than the overall genomic gc content. this was especially apparent in s. pacifica , suggesting that i-c arrays have been acquired from distantly related taxa. to the best of our knowledge, three of the cas array subtypes detected  have not previously been described despite containing known cas genes . these subtypes were designated as i-u based on convention  <cit> . however, the integrated microbial genomes  database  <cit>  revealed that a variety of bacteria from different phylogenetic groups possess equivalent arrays, indicating these are not unique to salinispora spp.figure  <dig>

cas <dig> is the signature gene of type i arrays  <cit> . a cas <dig> phylogeny revealed clades that corresponded to cas array subtype as opposed to taxonomic relationships . the finding of cas <dig> sequence similarities across species boundaries supports the concept that cas arrays evolve independent of their hosts  <cit> . furthermore, sequences within the array subtypes reveal evidence of recombination, as different salinispora species shared virtually identical cas <dig> genes. the same patterns were observed with cas <dig> genes and corresponding protein sequences , the most common phylogenetic marker for crispr-cas systems. the delineation of the cas array subtypes was supported by the repeat sequences, which frequently shared subtype-specific conservation  and averaged between 29 nt  and 37 nt .

cas-associated crisprs contained significantly more spacers than cas-devoid loci , as might be expected given that cas genes are required for spacer integration  <cit> . furthermore, subtypes i-e, i-c and i-b contained significantly more spacers  than the three i-u subtypes. considering the latter, i-u_sa and i-u_csx <dig> lack cas <dig> and are thus potentially unable to incorporate additional spacers, as cas <dig> is involved in spacer integration  <cit> .

crisprs illustrate interactions with foreign genetic elements
we assessed defensive functions of salinispora crisprs by analyzing for perfect matches between salinispora spacers and mobile genetic elements . these included  <dig> prophages that were identified in the  <dig> genomes  as well as mges deposited in the aclame database  <cit>  . on average, 11% of spacers matched salinispora prophages . prophage-devoid strains had a higher fraction of matching spacers than prophage-harboring strains , supporting a functional role of crisprs in phage immunity. in addition,  <dig> % of spacers matched known mges, which was comparable to observations for marine bacterial metagenomes  <cit>  and oral pathogens  <cit> . some spacers matched homologous elements from different viral genomes, suggesting they may target multiple phage strains. crisprtarget  <cit>  revealed that mges matched by salinispora spacers are associated with various protospacer-associated motifs , short sequences important for protospacer acquisition  <cit> . this suggests that salinispora spp. can detect different pams and integrate a large diversity of spacers. when including lower-quality matches  the majority  of spacers matched plasmids, suggesting that a major role for salinispora crisprs is to defend against plasmid integration. as no information about the plasmid content of the strains investigated is currently available, we focused on the role of crisprs in phage defense, while realizing this may not present a complete picture of crispr functionality in salinispora spp.

crisprs indicate differing defensive capacities among salinisporaspecies
s. arenicola had four-fold more spacers matching salinispora prophages and twelve-fold more spacers matching known mges than s. tropica. this corresponded to the fact that only two-third of s. arenicola but all s. tropica strains harbored prophages, with  <dig>  vs.  <dig>  prophages per genome, respectively . a substantial number of s. arenicola spacers that matched salinispora prophages were located in the i-u_sa cas arrays, which are specific to s. arenicola. this additional array and spacer diversity may provide superior defensive capacities for s. arenicola, which potentially contributes to its broader geographic distribution  <cit> . s. pacifica had an intermediate fraction of spacers matching salinispora prophages and known mges, with  <dig>  prophages per genome . there was a significantly lower frequency of prophages among phylotype c and f strains . while these phylotypes also contained significantly more spacers , the fraction of those spacers matching salinispora prophages and known mges was similar to other phylotypes. the differing phage sensitivities between s. pacifica phylotypes are thus independent from or only partially related to crisprs.

in contrast, the total numbers of crispr loci or spacers were uncorrelated with prophage content in all three species . for instance, strains cns- <dig> and cns- <dig> contained  <dig> and  <dig> crisprs with  <dig> and  <dig> spacers, respectively. despite these similarities, these strains harbored  <dig> and  <dig> prophages, respectively . the number and diversity of cas arrays were also uncorrelated with prophage content . for instance, s. pacifica strain dsm- <dig> contained four cas array subtypes and three prophages while the cas-devoid s. pacifica strain cns- <dig> only contained one prophage . thus, the number of crispr loci as well as the diversity of associated cas arrays appear to be affected by factors other than phage exposure.

history of salinisporainteractions with a common prophage
we focused on a common prophage that is related to the streptomyces sv <dig> phage and was detected in  <dig> salinispora strains from all three species . six percent of salinispora spacers matched sv1-related sequences, suggesting that this phage represents a major challenge to the genus. strains without an integrated sv <dig> prophage had a larger fraction of spacers matching sv <dig> in cas-associated loci  compared to those with an integrated sv <dig> prophage , supporting a specific targeting of this phage. the history of encounters with sv1-related phages was determined for six strains per species  by analyzing the location of matching spacers within spacer arrays according to the concept that ancestral spacers are commonly located at the ‘trailer’ end and more recent spacers at the ‘leader’ end of a spacer array  <cit> . matching spacers, the majority with unique sequences, were detected throughout the spacer arrays  suggesting recurring encounters with sv1-related phages over time. given that the sv <dig> phage represents a vector for genetic exchange  <cit> , it is interesting to speculate that it may represent a source of beneficial genetic material in addition to a survival challenge.figure  <dig>

linkages of crispr-cas features with microdiversity
salinispora microdiversity on the subspecies level has been defined based on 16s rrna phylotypes  and a multilocus phylogeny . we detected several correlations between crispr-cas features and microdiversity. for instance, one well-supported s. pacifica lineage contained the only strains  with a modified i-c array lacking cas1/cas <dig>  suggesting these genes have been lost in this lineage. another s. pacifica lineage  was unique in being entirely devoid of cas genes. also, certain clades were characterized by chromosomal relocations of crispr-cas systems, as seen with i-e arrays in s. pacifica  and s. tropica .

the most distinct linkages were observed among the four s. arenicola phylotype b strains, which contained significantly more crisprs and spacers than strains from s. arenicola phylotypes a and st . many spacers were unique to phylotype b, underlining that spacer composition can reflect population structure and evolutionary relationships  <cit> . crispr characteristics not only distinguished phylotype b from other phylotypes, but also the two subclades within phylotype b . for instance, a paired crispr locus and flanking genes were inverted in one of the subclades . furthermore, there were subclade-specific differences in spacer content. while multiple spacers were shared by all phylotype b strains, which is consistent with observations among other closely related bacteria  <cit> , spacer array alignments revealed three sets of spacers that were specific to one of the subclades . this probably illustrates subclade-specific deletions or insertions of whole spacer groups  <cit> . sixty-five percent of the group  <dig> spacers in cnh- <dig> and cnp- <dig> matched plasmids from alphaproteobacteria, while the group  <dig> spacers in cnh- <dig> and cnp- <dig> equally matched phages and largely gammaproteobacterial plasmids. this may coincide with differing defensive capacities or varying modes of interaction with mges between the two subclades. while prophage content appeared independent of these observations  mges are also involved in diversification  <cit> , niche adaptation  <cit> , and microdiversity  <cit> . it is hence interesting to speculate that these differences may influence the evolutionary or ecological divergence within s. arenicola phylotype b.figure  <dig>

biogeographic patterns in crispr and prophage content
the strains analyzed in this study originate from seven global collection sites and were derived from independent sediment samples. while sampling efforts were not uniform across locations and may have affected the biogeographic patterns observed, it is interesting to note that 40% of the spacers observed in more than one strain were restricted to specific locations and/or biomes, the latter describing major oceanic regions distinguished by oceanographic factors such as nutrient concentrations and primary productivity  <cit> . location-specific spacers provide evidence of exposure to local virus populations  <cit> , with the majority of localized spacers occurring in strains from the sea of cortez . this is a highly productive sea  <cit>  enclosed by a distinct geographical barrier and the only site classified as a coastal biome  <cit> . while these results are preliminary, it is intriguing to speculate that spacer sequences can be used to trace location-specific interactions with distinct mge pools, as also observed in other ecosystems  <cit> . a more nuanced biogeographic pattern was the detection of identical spacers with location-specific nucleotide substitutions, as found in strains from hawaii, fiji and palau . this may illustrate the presence of widespread mges that maintain location-specific genetic variants. furthermore, sv1-related prophages could be resolved into geographically confined lineages , supporting the concept that salinispora strains are exposed to location-specific mges.figure  <dig>

self-targeting spacers
several studies have reported the occurrence of ‘self-targeting spacers’ that match regions within the host genome  <cit> . while self-targeting spacers can be deleterious and strongly selected against  <cit> , they have also been suggested to function as regulatory elements  <cit>  or to affect genome content  <cit> . interestingly, a third of the  <dig> salinispora strains harbored such spacers, with perfect matches to e.g. a cytochrome p <dig> within a terpenoid biosynthetic pathway  <cit>  and two dna-modifying genes . however, experimental evidence would be required to determine potential regulatory roles. in addition, several self-targeting spacers matched resident prophages, suggesting that crispr interference may be ineffective in some cases. alternatively, self-targeting may be prevented by selective self vs. non-self mechanisms, such as variations in spacer flanking sequences  <cit> .table  <dig>

CONCLUSIONS
this study describes a comprehensive survey of crispr-cas systems among a large collection of strains from a cosmopolitan marine actinomycete genus. the finding of ubiquitous and diverse crispr-cas systems suggests that salinispora maintains a robust mechanism to mediate interactions with mges, which may be of ecological and evolutionary relevance in virally rich marine sediments  <cit> . future surveys of crispr-cas systems will provide additional opportunities to assess the evolutionary history of mge exposure, the effectiveness of these systems as mechanisms of adaptive defense, and how crisprs may be linked to the ecology and evolution of salinispora.
