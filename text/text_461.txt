BACKGROUND

according to genetic and clinical criteria, e. coli has been classified into commensal, intestinal pathogenic and expec groups  <cit> . expec has become a bacterial pathogen that threatens the health of humans and animals. these strains can cause a wide range of extraintestinal infections, including in the urinary tract, central nervous system, circulatory system and respiratory system  <cit> . in recent years, some reports have demonstrated that expec has been frequently isolated from clinical samples in the swine industry in china  <cit> , leading to significant economic losses.

to date, several e. coli isolates have had their whole genomes sequenced, including intestinal pathogenic e. coli and extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli. based on the whole sequenced genomes, e. coli can be classified into four major phylogroups . expec are mainly distributed into phylogroups b <dig>  d <dig>  d <dig> and f, but occasionally into other phylogroups such as a and b <dig> depending on the virulence gene repertoire  <cit> . however, to date, little work has been conducted to characterize the expec that caused fatal pneumonia at a pig farm in changchun, china. in this paper, we isolated the expec from swine lungs from china and describe the genome characteristics of the isolate.

RESULTS
gross post mortem examination and histological examination
the pig carcass was in fair nutritional condition. there was no evidence of any viruses or external parasites. only the lungs had some congestion and bleeding. the stomach was devoid of contents. there was nothing remarkable about any of the other visceral systems. the histological preparations of the lungs showed the presence of inflammatory cells in the bronchioles and the surrounding alveoli , and presence of some bleeding and edema . histological examinations of pneumonia-like presentation may be classified as bronchopneumonia.fig.  <dig> histological preparation of swine lungs . note the presence of inflammatory cells in the bronchioles  and the surrounding alveoli 




bacterial isolates and serotyping
some colonies were obtained from the pig lung, in colonies, only one colony was selected, which contained two of the expec virulence markers, iuta and papc, named slpe. the slpe isolate was positive for serogroup o <dig> 

experimental challenge studies
the slpe isolate killed all of the mice at the 5 × 107 cfu, 5 × 106 cfu and 5 × 105 cfu challenge doses, but the surviving time of each group is different, the 5 × 107 cfu dose group only survived  <dig> to 8 h and the 5 × 106 cfu and 5 × 105 cfu dose group survived  <dig> to 18 h. all of the mice in the negative control group survived without any clinical signs. all tested were dissected and examined for lesion, the lungs had some bleeding and swelling, but there was nothing remarkable lesions in other tissues and organs. the slpe presented as a highly virulent expec strain in the mouse model. chen et al., has isolated  <dig> expec in china, only  <dig> isolated of these killed 5/ <dig> mice at a challenge dose of 105 cfu  <cit> .

antimicrobial resistance

the mic values for the  <dig> antimicrobial agents obtained from the examinations of the slpe isolates are shown. cefotaxime was found to be the most active compound in vitro . the isolates was already resistant to the rest of the antimicrobials and displayed the following mic values:  florfenicol, mic = 128 μg/ml;  doxycycline, mic = 128 μg/ml;  ciprofloxacin, mic = 64 μg/ml;  tilmicosin, mic = 512 μg/ml;  enrofloxacin, mic = 128 μg/ml;  sulfamethoxazole, mic>512 μg/ml and  amikacin, mic = 128 μg/ml.

genomic features
a total of  <dig> contigs from the genome were assembled onto  <dig> scaffolds. the predicted genome size was  <dig>  mb, with an n <dig> value of  <dig>  for the assembly. ombining the glimmer  <dig> , genemark and z-curve programs annotations gave  <dig> genes with approximately  <dig> % gc content, which is similar to other reported e. coli genomes. this whole genome shotgun project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession ljcg <dig> . the slpe genome harbour some resistance genes, including marc, soxr, mate, abc genes, tet, flor and also carrie class iintegrons. but the gene cassettes of iintegrons genes, that conferred resistance to tetracycline, fluoroquinolone, aminoglycosides and so on.

phylogenomic genome analysis of slpe with other e. coli pathotypes
the phylogenomic tree was constructed to examine the slpe strain in the context of the e. coli population structure. figure  <dig> shows that the  <dig> e. coli strains were divided into five monophyletic phylogroups . the slpe strain belongs to the b <dig> monophyletic phylogroup, and its closest relative is apec  <dig> fig.  <dig> phylogenomic tree of the  <dig> e. coli strains. blastp, perl, mcl, clustalw and mega were used to reconstruct the phylogenomic tree. the phylogenomic tree of different e. coli based on the comparison of  <dig> core genes. the  <dig> e. coli strains are divided into five monophyletic phylogroups . the slpe strains are highlighted in blackbody. slpe is the closest relative to apec 078




distribution diagram of the pan-genome virulence genes
the distribution of the expec virulence factors were analysed among the  <dig> sequenced e. coli strains. figure  <dig> shows that expec-specific virulence factors were classified into the following six categories:  adhesins,  invasins,  toxins,  iron acquisition/transport systems,  polysialic acid synthesis and  other virulence genes. the  <dig> virulence genes from the  <dig> sequenced strains are shown in fig.  <dig>  the distribution diagram shows that even though there were significant differences between the slpe and apec <dig> strains, that these two strains are most closely related to one another. we also found that slpe has more expec-specific virulence factors, including several virulence factors that are expec strain-specific, such as fimbrial adhesins , irea, pgtp, hlyf, the pix gene cluster and fecr .fig.  <dig> the distribution diagram of the pan-genome virulence genes among  <dig> e. coli strains. the right side of the vertical line shows e. coli strains that are consistent with the phylogenetic tree  with the following labels:  b <dig> monophyletic phylogroup, blue;  a monophyletic phylogroup, red;  e monophyletic phylogroup, green;  d monophyletic phylogroup, cyan and  b <dig> monophyletic phylogroup, purple. the slpe strains are highlighted with the key symbol. the top shows the following six classified clusters:  fimbrial/adhesin, blue;  iron acquisition/exporting protein, green;  toxin/invasin, red;  capsule synthetic gene cluster, brown;  protectins, yellow and  others, purple. the red and black bodies show the distribution of the virulence genes among these strains. a red side implies that the virulence genes are present, while the black side implies that the genes are absent




analysis of the capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster
we found a capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster  in the slpe genomes using blastp. this cps was closely related to the klebsiella pneumonia cps. the klebsiella pneumonia cps is closely related to klebsiella pneumonia pathogenesis. the similarity and gc content of the  <dig> cpss from klebsiella pneumoniae genomes and  <dig> cps from an e. coli strain were analysed. the results are shown in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we isolated expec isolates  from pig farms and demonstrated that the slpe isolates are pneumonia pathogens. then, we performed genome sequencing and comparative genomic analysis with the slpe isolates. our analysis identified differences between slpe and other expec strains including various differences in the toxin and capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene clusters.

the phylogenomic comparison indicated that the slpe strain belongs to the b <dig> monophyletic phylogroup, with its closest relative being apec o <dig>  apec o <dig>  an o <dig> strain, is an avian pathogenic e. coli isolated from the lungs of turkey that caused extensive animal and financial losses globally  <cit> . although the slpe and apec o <dig> hosts are different, the strains have similar evolutionary relationships and both contain  <dig> homologous genes. now the question remains whether they have a common ancestor that is worthy of our attention.

expec strains contain certain specific virulence traits that enable them to invade and colonize extraintestinal sites and cause a wide range of infections  <cit> . in this study, the distribution diagram of the pan-genome virulence genes showed that there were significant differences between the slpe and apec <dig>  although they are most closely related to one another. we also found that slpe has more expec-specific virulence factors, including several virulence factors that are expec strain-specific, such as fimbrial adhesins , irea, pgtp, hlyf, the pix gene cluster and fecr. of these genes, only papg ii has been proven to have contact with urethral and avian pathogenicity  <cit> . these genes’ functions in pig expecs have yet to be explored.

in china, liu et al., has reported the full genome characterization of expec pcn <dig> strain isolated from pigs. the expec virulence markers are different between pcn <dig> and slpe, and the comparative genomic analysis results are different. slpe was assigned to group b <dig> and clustered with apec  <dig>  while pcn <dig> was assigned to group d <dig>  <cit> . furthermore, we found a capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster  in the slpe strain genomes, this cps was closely related to the klebsiella pneumonia cps. the gene homology was approximately 96%  and the homology of genes responsible for the serotype  was approximately 99%. additionally, the gc content of the cps was  <dig> %, which is significantly lower than the full genome. these results suggest that the slpe cps may have been transferred from klebsiella pneumoniae. based on further analysis, the klebsiella pneumonia cps is the best characterized virulence factor in pneumonia and urinary tract infections  <cit> . functional analysis of the slpe cps will be forthcoming.

CONCLUSIONS
the slpe isolated from swine lungs in china, was assigned to group b <dig> and clustered with apec  <dig>  the comparative genomic analysis revealed several genes for their further study. we found a cps in the slpe strain genomes, and this cps is closely related to the cps from klebsiella pneumoniae. in conclusion, the mechanisms of expec virulence still remain largely unknown. studies on expec pathogenesis will be enhanced by public access to high-quality genomic sequences.
