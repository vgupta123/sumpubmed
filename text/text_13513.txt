BACKGROUND
plzf is a widely studied gene due to its involvement in varied biological processes. it was originally discovered as being fused with the rara  gene in translocations underlying acute promyelocytic leukemias in humans  <cit> . the most prominent phenotypic features of plzf null mice are defects in patterning of limb and axial skeleton structures  <cit> . affected animals exhibit homeotic-like anterior-to-posterior transformations in the axial and appendicular skeleton, causing hindlimb abnormalities such as extra digits and conversion of the fibula to a tibia-like structure. the spontaneous mutation luxoid , later shown to be an allele of plzf, is characterized by similar, albeit semidominant, limb abnormalities and recessive skeletal defects  <cit> .

a critical function of plzf is in spermatogonial stem cell renewal. both the null and luxoid alleles cause progressive male infertility due to depletion of the spermatogonial stem cell pool with age  <cit> . in the absence of plzf, the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of spermatogonial stem cells is disrupted. plzf is present as nuclear foci in type a-single , a-paired , and a-aligned  spermatogonia, but not the more differentiated type b spermatogonia or in subsequent meiotic spermatocytes or postmeiotic spermatids  <cit> .

plzf contains nine krüppel-type sequence-specific zinc finger dna binding domains and a btb/poz protein-protein interaction domain in its n terminus. the latter allows btb domain-containing proteins to form homo- or hetero-dimers  <cit> . btb-containing proteins, including plzf, function as transcriptional repressors that affect gene expression via chromatin remodeling  <cit> . the repressive activity of the btb domain can be autonomous, or it can mediate interactions with co-repressors that in turn recruit histone deacetylases, resulting in epigenetic silencing  <cit> .

the skeletal patterning defects of plzf null mice  have been linked to failed transcriptional repression of the hoxd complex genes  <cit> . plzf was found to bind promoter regions in the abdb hoxd complex, directly interacting with polycomb proteins, and thereby recruiting histone deacetylases to silence gene expression  <cit> . the spermatogonial stem cell renewal defects in plzf mutants have been linked to failed transcriptional silencing of kit  <cit> . the kit receptor is present in differentiating spermatogonia in adult mice, and is required for the first wave of prepubertal spermatogonial expansion  <cit> . therefore, kit is a critical factor in spermatogonial differentiation, and the control of its expression affects the balance of stem cell maintenance. plzf directly binds the kit promoter, and plzf-deficient mice have elevated kit transcription  <cit> , presumably resulting in a tipping of the balance from stem cell maintenance towards differentiation, and thus eventual exhaustion of the spermatogonial stem cell pool.

here, we report a separation-of-function allele of plzf called seven toes , which was recovered in an enu mutagenesis screen  <cit> . this allele exhibits skeletal phenotypes similar, but not identical, to the luxoid and null plzf alleles. importantly, plzf7t lacks the germ cell depletion phenotypes of all previously reported plzf alleles. plzf7t has a missense mutation in the btb domain, which must disrupt a molecular activity involved in normal skeleton morphogenesis that is separate from that required for silencing of kit in spermatogonial regeneration.

RESULTS
generation and positional cloning of the seven toes  mutation
7t arose in an n-ethyl-n-nitrosourea  mutagenesis screen that employed a balancer chromosome to detect mutations on proximal mouse chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . affected animals exhibited recessive limb patterning defects  without other obvious abnormalities. f <dig> intercrosses indicated mendelian segregation of the limb phenotype. however, it was evident that 7t was unlinked to chromosome  <dig> 

to positionally clone 7t, an f <dig> mapping cross was conducted, resulting in its localization to a  <dig>  mb interval on chr  <dig> between d9mit <dig> and d9mit <dig> . according to the july  <dig> mouse genome assembly , the critical region contains  <dig> annotated refseq genes . the coding regions of  <dig> were pcr-amplified from genomic dna and/or cdna, and were scanned by dhplc to identify dna sequence alterations. a variation was detected in plzf, which consists of  <dig> exons spanning  <dig>  kb of genomic dna . plzf is annotated to produce a  <dig>  nt transcript encoding a  <dig> amino acid protein . as described earlier, mutations in plzf cause skeletal phenotypes similar to those of 7t . the amplimer of plzf that contained a dhplc variant was sequenced, revealing an a to g transition at nucleotide  <dig> of the plzf cdna . this is predicted to alter amino acid  <dig> from the polar and acidic amino acid glutamic acid, into the nonpolar neutral amino acid glycine . this amino acid resides in the conserved btb domain of plzf .

7t is allelic to plzflu
to determine if the glu44gly mutation in plzf is responsible for the 7t phenotype, we performed complementation tests with the plzflu  allele. in crosses of 7t/7t to lu/+ mice, a total of  <dig> pups were born, of which  <dig> displayed polydactyly of the hindlimb and anterior-posterior transformation in the axial skeletal ; dna sequencing revealed that all  <dig> were 7t/lu. the failure to complement demonstrates that 7t is an allele of plzf, which we will refer to as plzf7t . however, like 7t homozygotes, lu/7t males had testes of normal size, and there was no indication of substantial germ cell depletion in testis histology . therefore, 7t appears to be a separation-of-function mutation in which skeletal patterning is affected but not germ cell maintenance. we also noticed that the 7t allele rescued the growth retardation and pre-wean lethality of the lu/lu animals. a summary of the similarities and differences between 7t and other plzf alleles, incorporating data presented below, is presented in table  <dig>  notably, lu is semidominant in that heterozygotes exhibit skeletal defects unlike either 7t or the null allele  <cit> . it is possible that lu is more severe due to dominant negative effects of a truncated protein that it potentially encodes .

plzf7t causes skeletal abnormalities
mouse limbs contain three basic segments. proximal to distal, these are:  the stylopod ;  the zeugopod, containing two skeletal elements ; and  the autopod, comprised of the wrist/ankle and digits. plzf7t/7t mice exhibit defects in all three segments of the hindlimb , but not the forelimb. it was reported that 5% of plzf-/- mice had forelimb defects in addition to the hindlimb abnormalities  <cit> . the polydactyly phenotype in the autopod of 7t/7t  hindlimbs was 100% penetrant ; all  <dig> genotype-verified homozygotes had polydactyly, compared to 92% reported for null mutants  <cit> . however, other hindlimb structures were not as severely affected by the 7t allele compared to the knockout , including the metatarsals. in 20% of 7t/7t limbs, the talus  was transformed into a calcaneus . 20% of the hindpaws had webbing between digits i and ii , and we observed autopod metatarsal fusions in 13% of mice .

in the zeugopod region, the tibia and fibula failed to fuse in 47% of 7t/7t mice . additionally, 40% of fibulae were thickened and 40% of tibiae were transformed to fibulae . there was a shortening of zeugopod/absence of fibula in 33% of limbs, but no animals develop duplication or absence of the patella or meniscus .

all of the 7t/7t animals  had  <dig> thoracic vertebrae as in wild-type, , but 70% of plzf-/- mice were reported to have  <dig>  <cit> . the additional segment of plzf-/- vertebrae is associated with an extra pair of ribs that also attached to the sternum. unlike the wild type, 73% of 7t/7t mice had elongated 8th and 9th ribs that attached to the sternum . all plzf-/- mice had malformed xiphoid processes  compared to only 40% of the 7t/7t mice . unlike the nulls, none of the 7t homozygotes had a truncated and kinked tail. these results demonstrated that 7t causes a similar but milder axial phenotype than the reported knock-out allele, but the polydactyly phenotypes are essentially identical with higher penetrance. table  <dig> summarizes the skeletal phenotypes of null and 7t/7t mice.

7t/7t mice do not exhibit spermatogonial depletion
whereas lu/lu and plzf-/- males undergo male germ cell depletion and infertility due to defective spermatogonial stem cell renewal, 7t homozygotes were normally fertile. in matings to c3heb/fej  females, c3h semi-congenic males  sired an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  pups compared to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for c3h control males , indicating the 7t does not impact fertility negatively. notably, lu/lu males co-isogenic on c3h/he  were found to be infertile , thus making it unlikely that genetic background is responsible for the disparate lu and 7t fertility phenotypes.

lu/lu and plzf-/- adults have small testes and markedly decreased numbers of germ cells in seminiferous tubules. this sertoli cell only-like syndrome becomes more prominent with age as the stem cell pool declines  <cit> . 7t/7t males did not exhibit small testes at any age. nevertheless, we performed histological analysis of their testes to reveal potential germ cell depletion. there were no agametic tubules in young mice, unlike the null and luxoid alleles . only at older ages  did some mice exhibit sertoli cell only tubules  compared to <1% in wildtype . to quantify any possible minor effects on the germ cell pool, testis immunostaining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen , a marker of cells in early g <dig> and s phases of the cell cycle, was performed on 7t/7t mice at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> months, lu/lu mice at  <dig> months, and wild types at  <dig> months of age. twenty randomly selected tubules from each testis were counted for pcna+ cells. pcna+ cells remained present in most tubules of 7t/7t testes at  <dig> months  of age and older, with no evidence of quantitative decline . this contrasts with the lu/lu and null mutants, where over 50% of tubules were pcna-negative at  <dig> months of age   <cit> . the 7t allele also rescued the male germ cell depletion phenotype of lu, as lu/7t had normal testes . these data indicate that the 7t allele does not appreciably affect spermatogonial stem cell maintenance.

expression of plzf and predicted effect of the 7t mutation on plzf's btb domain
to assess the stability of plzf7t, western blot analysis of testis protein from various control and mutant genotypes was performed. a species of the predicted full-length size of plzf  was present in wt, 7t/7t, 7t/+ and 7t/lu but not lu/lu , which contains a nonsense mutation in codon  <dig> of the  <dig> amino acid protein  and thus should serve as negative control. these data indicate that the 7t mutation does not decrease, to any major qualitative degree, the level of plzf in mutant testes relative to various control genotypes . thus, we surmise that the amino acid change encoded by the 7t mutation alters plzf function.

alignment of mouse plzf amino acid sequence surrounding residue  <dig> indicated that this region is highly conserved amongst vertebrates including zebrafish  and chicken  . however, the particular mutated amino acid  is not absolutely conserved in the btb domains of all proteins of the btb-zf  family .

the btb domain structure of human plzf was determined at  <dig> a resolution, revealing a tightly intertwined dimer  <cit> . amino acid residue  <dig> is located in the 3rd β-sheet of the btb domain, in a charged pocket that facilitates dimerization  <cit> . it has been shown that mutations that cause misfolding of the btb domain result in failed dimerization and therefore nonfunctional protein products  <cit> . the proper charge alignment in the btb pocket is required for plzf transcriptional repression via histone deacetylase  recruitment  <cit> . therefore, the glu44gly mutation may alter both the conformation and the charge of the btb domain, thus affecting its function.

discussion
through a forward genetics approach, we isolated a new allele  of plzf. the 7t/7t mice displayed skeleton abnormalities similar to the null and nonsense  alleles, without the male germ cell depletion phenotype observed in the two previously reported alleles. a glu44gly mutation was found in the evolutionarily conserved btb domain, which mediates protein-protein interactions. the glu44gly may weaken, disrupt or change the conformation of interactions between plzf and itself or other btb/poz domain-containing proteins, thereby affecting the expression of genes involved in skeletal patterning. the expression of hoxd genes, hoxa <dig> and bone morphogenetic proteins  are misregulated in plzf-/- mice, however, expression of shh and fgf <dig> is not altered  <cit> . therefore, plzf is likely to mediate aspects of anterior-posterior pattering in both the axial and limb skeleton through the btb/poz domain.

the lack of a germ cell depletion phenotype indicates that 7t is a separation-of-function mutation that can provide insight into the functional domains of plzf. given existing information, there are two likely mechanistic explanations for why the mutation specifically affects skeletal patterning. one is that alteration of the btb domain abolishes co-repressor binding in cell types involved in skeletal development, but does not alter binding of co-repressor in germ cells required for silencing kit. a second possibility is that the btb domain is not required for plzf's role in repressing kit expression in spermatogonia. we hypothesize that since the zinc finger domains remain intact in the 7t allele, that sequence-specific binding of plzf7t to the kit promoter is unaffected by the btb domain disruption. interestingly, a human patient with skeletal defects and genital hypoplasia was identified as carrying a missense allele of plzf in trans to a deletion  <cit> . the nonconservative met617val alteration occurred in a zinc finger motif, causing functional disruption in reporter assays. these data suggest that the zn finger domains  are important for both skeletal and germ cell functions. this patient also had phenotypes that were not apparent or tested in any of the mouse plzf mutant models, including severe mental retardation, short stature, dystrophy, microcephaly, cranial dysmorphisms, and cryptorchidism. it is likely that many of these phenotypes are related to the deletion, rather than homozygous loss of plzf, since other patients with deletions in this region of 11q share the non-genital phenotypes  <cit> .

the 7t/7t mutation was induced on strain c57bl/6j  and backcrossed into c3h for five generations . in the earlier generations , the hindlimbs displayed more severe abnormalities  than in later generations . this may explain why the limb and axial skeleton phenotypes of 7t/7t mice were not as severe as in null mice . during the positional cloning process, plzf7t was outcrossed to several different inbred strains, including cast/ei. more than  <dig> f <dig> offspring from the cast/ei crosses were recovered, yielding the expected number of f <dig> homozygotes, but none of these displayed polydactyly. this presumably dominant modifier effect was not seen in similar crosses to strains balb/cj or dba/2j. a similar modifier effect was observed in twist mutants  <cit>  and strong's luxoid  <cit> . these observations open the door to the potential identification of modifiers that function in the same developmental pathway as plzf. homozygous 7t males were fertile on all strain backgrounds; thus the phenotype modifications appear limited to skeletal defects.

CONCLUSIONS
this work demonstrates the utility of forward genetic approaches for the dissection of functional domains within a protein, and the roles of those domains in various cell types and developmental processes. the 7t separation of function mutation will be informative for eventual mechanistic elucidation of how this protein acts in different milieus, namely, skeletal development and in the germ lineage.
