BACKGROUND
streptococcus parasanguinis is an early colonizer of human tooth surface  <cit>  and functions for the subsequent colonization of other oral bacteria. the accumulation of oral microorganisms on the tooth surfaces leads to the development of a structured microbial community known as dental plaque, one of the most common human biofilms  <cit> .

the adhesion of s. parasanguinis fw <dig> to an in vitro tooth model is mediated by its long, peritrichous fimbriae  <cit> . a fimbriae-associated adhesin, fap <dig>  is the major subunit of the long fimbriae  <cit> . fap <dig>  a serine-rich glycoprotein, is required for biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxylapatite . a fap <dig> genomic island has been identified in the s. parasanguinis fw <dig> genome. this island consists of seven genes, secy <dig>  gap <dig> to gap <dig>  seca <dig>  gtf <dig>  and gtf <dig> and has been shown to play an important role in fap <dig> glycosylation and biogenesis  <cit> . moreover, gene clusters similar to the fap <dig> locus have been identified in other gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, and streptococcus agalactiae  <cit> . the findings that the fap1-like loci are widespread among gram-positive bacteria suggest that there is a common mechanism in the biogenesis of serine-rich glycoproteins. therefore, the study of the fap <dig> locus will help us to understand the molecular mechanism underlying the biogenesis of fap1-like molecules.

in this study, we characterized a fap <dig> glycosylation-associated gene gap <dig> and identified three amino acid residues in gap <dig> that are essential for mature fap <dig> glycosylation and biogenesis. we also determined the effects of the gap <dig> mutagenesis on s. parasanguinis fimbriae formation and bacterial adhesion.

RESULTS
identification of a small conserved region that is required for gap <dig> function
gap <dig> and its homologues in gram-positive bacteria, asp <dig> of s. gordonii, sag <dig> and gbs <dig> of s. agalactiae, sp <dig> of s. pneumoniae and se <dig> of staphylococcus epidermidis, were identified from the corresponding genomes and aligned to determine the conserved regions ; a search of protein databases was carried out to predict functional significance  of the conserved sequences using online bioinformatics programs. a series of in-frame deletion mutants and site-directed mutants of gap <dig> were constructed to investigate if these conserved or putatively functional regions/residues were required for gap <dig> function and involved in fap <dig> biogenesis. one region contains the peptide sequence of pdlpil , which was also found in a signal receiver domain of a bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis regulator protein, gela, of sphingomonas elodea  <cit> ; another region has a peptide sequence of indeekknhivenr , which has a putative coiled-coil domain as predicated by an online program  <cit> . we hypothesized the two regions are functionally relevant to fap <dig> glycosylation. interestingly, deletion of the highly conserved region, Δ62– <dig>  inhibited the production of the  <dig> kda mature fap <dig> , whereas deletion of the predicted coiled-coil domain from amino acid residues  <dig> to  <dig> did not affect mature fap <dig> production , suggesting the amino acid residues from  <dig> to  <dig>  pdlpil were important for gap <dig> function in fap <dig> glycosylation.

identification of gap <dig> residues that affect mature fap <dig> production
to define the critical residues responsible for gap <dig> function, we used a site-directed mutagenesis scheme to change all amino acids in this 62pdlpil <dig> sequence. we also mutated some other conserved amino acids , the amino acid residues derived from three conserved regions, 33vnfynp <dig>   <dig> npqals <dig> and 51srtnyq <dig>  these conserved regions are also present in gene products that are relevant to protein glycosylation. 33vnfynp <dig> was found in beta-glucosidase bgic of thermomonospoa fusca ; 37npqlas <dig> was found in both glycogen phosphorylase of fusobacterium nucleatum  and cdp-diacylglycerol – glycerol-3-phosphate 3-phosphatidyl-transferase of synechocystis sp.; whereas 51srtnyq <dig> is observed in a glucan  <dig> -alpha-maltohexaosidase of exiguobacterium sibiricum . therefore, we generated the conserved residues directed mutants and determined the functional contribution of these conserved residues to gap <dig> activity and fap <dig> glycosylation. three fap <dig> specific mabs, including two glycan-specific antibodies f <dig> and d <dig> and one peptide-specific antibody e <dig>  <cit>  were used to examine the effect of the gap <dig> mutation on fap <dig> production. two forms of fap <dig> were identified, the mature  <dig> kda fap <dig>  recognized by all three mabs and a  <dig> kda fap <dig> recognized only by e <dig> and d <dig>  <cit> . the  <dig> kda fap <dig> precursor, found in some gap <dig> mutants, has been identified as a partially glycosylated form of fap <dig>  <cit> . most gap <dig> site-directed mutants, v33r, f35h, n37i, p38r, s42l, n54i, p62g and d63v retained the ability to produce the  <dig> kda mature fap <dig> , suggesting that these amino acids in gap <dig> are not involved in fap <dig> glycosylation. in contrast,  <dig> site-directed mutants in the pdlpil region, the l64r, p65r and l67t mutants failed to produce the  <dig> kda mature fap <dig>  instead they generated the  <dig> kda partially glycosylated fap <dig> precursor . since both leucine residues  <dig> and  <dig> are important for gap <dig> function, we also mutated an adjacent leucine residue l <dig>  the l75r mutant did not alter fap <dig> glycosylation , suggesting the importance of l <dig> and l <dig> residues is position-specific. another highly conserved residue near 62pdlpil <dig>  r <dig>  was also mutated with leucine and was proved to have no effect on fap <dig> glycosylation . interestingly, mutation of a less conserved residue, i66n, resulted in a production of both the  <dig> kda mature fap <dig> and the  <dig> kda partially glycosylated fap <dig> . to confirm the mutagenesis did not alter the gap <dig> stability and expression, the gap <dig> site-directed variants were tagged with gfp  and the expression of gap3-gfp variants was determined by western blot analysis . all the mutant variants were expressed at the same level, suggesting that the mutagenesis did not change the stability of gap <dig>  therefore we conclude that the three highly conserved amino acid residues are essential for gap <dig> function and have an obvious impact on glycosylation of fap <dig> 

cell surface expression of fap1
a bactelisa method was used to investigate fap <dig> expression on the cell surface. the wild type strain fw <dig> and the gap <dig> complemented strain vt <dig> reacted strongly with fap1-specific antibodies, mabs f <dig> and e <dig> . the gap <dig> i66n mutant reacted with both f <dig> and e <dig>  suggesting that i66n mutation did not significantly affect the cell surface expression of mature fap <dig>  the l64r, p65r and l67t mutants all had low levels of reactivity with mab e <dig> in comparison with the fap <dig> null mutant and the gap <dig> insertional mutant. these results suggested that only a minimal amount of partially glycosylated fap <dig> precursor was present on the cell surface of the three mutants.

the surface morphological changes of the gap <dig> mutants
transmission electron microscopy  was used to examine the effects of the site-directed mutagenesis of gap <dig> on fimbrial formation of s. parasanguinis. among the  <dig> site-directed mutants, three mutants l64r, p65r and l67t lost the long peritrichous fimbriae , which are characteristic of the wild type strain fw <dig>  <cit> , whereas the fourth mutant i66n retained its long fimbriae . these data demonstrated the partially glycosylated form of fap <dig> in these mutants could not be assembled into the long fimbriae.

the in vitro adhesion assay
fap <dig> is important for s. parasanguinis adhesion  <cit> . the above data showed that gap <dig> site-directed mutation affected fap <dig> glycosylation and biogenesis. an adhesion experiment was performed to determine if the partially glycosylated form of fap <dig> could still function in adhesion of the gap <dig> mutants . like fap <dig> and gap <dig> null mutants, the l64r, p65r and l67t mutants failed to adhere to sha, suggesting the partially glycosylated form was unable to function in bacterial adhesion. i66n had a modest reduction in bacterial adhesion, indicating the i <dig> mutation only had a minor effect on adhesion.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
fap <dig>  a  <dig> kda glycoprotein, is the major subunit of the long fimbriae of streptococcus parasanguinis  <cit> . a genomic island in the chromosome of s. parasanguinis fw <dig> is involved in fap <dig> biosynthesis. this genomic island contains a seven-gene cluster located immediately downstream of fap <dig>  this cluster includes secy <dig>  gap <dig>  gap <dig>  gap <dig> , seca <dig>  gtf <dig> and gtf <dig> that are differentially involved in fap <dig> glycosylation and secretion  <cit> . our previous studies showed that the gene product gap <dig> is involved in fap <dig> glycosylation  <cit> . in this study, we determined the critical amino acid residues that are important for its function. we first aligned gap <dig> and its homologues to find the conserved regions and then took bioinformatics approaches to further analyze functional domains. a conserved peptide sequence, 62pdlpil <dig> was found to be critical for gap <dig> function and fap <dig> glycosylation. this sequence domain was also found in a signal receiver domain of a bacterial polysaccharide biosynthesis regulator protein, gela, of sphingomonas elodea . this may explain why this region is important for fap <dig> glycosylation. interestingly, the other predicted important peptide sequence from residue  <dig> to  <dig> of gap <dig> is not required for fap <dig> glycosylation despite the fact it has a putative coiled-coil structure . therefore, we conclude the 62pdlpil <dig> sequence is critical for gap <dig> function.

site-directed mutagenesis was used to replace every amino acid in the sequence 62pdlpil <dig> by a disfavored amino acid  <cit>  to determine which amino acid in this region are important for fap <dig> glycosylation. l64r, p65r and l67t mutants failed to produce fully-glycosylated mature fap <dig>  indicating the amino acids l <dig>  p <dig> and l <dig> are critical for the complete glycosylation of fap <dig>  the replacement of the hydrophobic residues l <dig>  p <dig> and l <dig> by charged and hydrophilic residues  did not change overall gap <dig> structure as all these mutant variants expressed gap <dig> equally . these findings highlight the importance of three residues for gap <dig> function.

site-directed mutagenesis of  <dig> other conserved amino acids v <dig>  f <dig>  n <dig>  p <dig>  s <dig>  n <dig> and r <dig> did not alter fap <dig> glycosylation despite these amino acids  residing in putative conserved functional domains. mutagenesis of an adjacent leucine residue l <dig> did not change fap <dig> glycosylation either. these results support the notion that these three important residues identified in 62pdlpil <dig> region are site-specific in gap <dig> function.

the mechanism for how this region is involved in gap <dig> function currently is unknown. many hydrophobic residues are functionally important in the protein-protein interaction processes  <cit> . the pdlpil region has two proline and two leucine residues, both are hydrophobic amino acids and have been shown to play important roles in molecular- or substrate-recognition through hydrophobic interactions  <cit> . in this study, we replaced the conserved, hydrophobic amino acids with hydrophilic or charged, polar amino acids whose properties are totally different . the site-directed mutagenesis resulted in the attenuation of gap <dig> activity in fap <dig> complete glycosylation. interestingly, the mutagenesis of a less conserved amino acid, i <dig> in the same region, had only a minor effect on mature fap <dig> production, suggesting that i <dig> is less critical in gap <dig> function and may not be crucial in mediating protein-protein interactions that are important for gap <dig> mediated fap <dig> glycosylation.

fap <dig> is a structural subunit of bacterial long fimbriae and essential for fimbrial assembly and bacterial adhesion  <cit> . in this study, we demonstrated that the partially glycosylated fap <dig> precursor produced by the gap <dig> site-directed mutants, l64r, p65r and l67t could not be assembled into the long fimbriae, suggesting that glycosylation plays an important role in fap <dig> mediated fimbrial formation. all mutants that failed to produce mature fap <dig> could not adhere well to sha in vitro, further demonstrating the importance of mature fap <dig> in bacterial adhesion. interestingly the i66n mutant that produces both mature and premature fap <dig> still displays fimbriae on the cell surface and is able to adhere to sha, supporting the concept that mature fap <dig> is required for fimbrial biogenesis and bacterial adhesion. understanding the underlying mechanism will help to define fap <dig> biogenesis and fimbrial assembly pathways.

our finding of  <dig> critical residues in gap <dig> function does not preclude the possible roles of other amino acids that were not selected for this study. gap <dig> protein is predicted to be involved in a glycosylation-related complex with other gap proteins . our future investigations will be to determine if there are more active sites in gap <dig> associated with protein-protein interaction during fap <dig> biogenesis process.

in conclusion, we have identified that  <dig> highly conserved residues, l <dig>  p <dig> and l <dig> of gap <dig> that are critical for complete fap <dig> glycosylation, long fimbrial formation and bacterial adhesion. because the glycosylation-association protein is conserved in many other streptococci and staphylococci, and the three residues we identified are also highly conserved, this work may shed a light on further understanding the mechanism of biogenesis of fap1-like serine-rich glycoproteins.
