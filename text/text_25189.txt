BACKGROUND
the lipid second messenger, phosphatidic acid  is produced by phospholipase d  in a variety of intracellular signalling pathways, including cell adhesion and migration, vesicular trafficking and phagocytosis  <cit> . phosphatidic acid transduces the signal by altering the localisation and/or activity of its target proteins. a number of proteins are known to be regulated by ptdoh in this way, such as the cyclic amp phosphodiesterase pde4a <dig>  <cit> , raf- <dig> kinase  <cit> , sphingosine-1-kinase  <cit> , phospholipase c isoforms  <cit> , atypical protein kinase c isoforms  <cit> , and p47-phox  <cit> .

identification of ptdoh-target proteins is often achieved by dissection of the pathways involving pld, however, screening methods using a ptdoh-coated resin have indicated a number of interesting potential target proteins such as n-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor , coatomer and arf proteins  <cit> . phage display is a well-established method for identifying novel proteins capable of interactions with a range of ligands, including proteins  <cit> , lipids  <cit>  and carbohydrates  <cit> , so was used in the present study to identify potential ptdoh-target proteins. this highlighted a potential ptdoh-binding motif in the transmembrane solute transporter glut <dig> 

glut <dig> translocation in response to insulin involves a number of lipid signalling molecules, including ptdinsp <dig>  ptdinsp, and ptdinsp <dig>  these lipids play a major role in insulin signalling, as numerous studies have shown the pi3k inhibitor wortmannin to block insulin-stimulated increases in glut <dig> translocation and glucose uptake by over 90%  <cit> . the role of pld-generated ptdoh in stimulation of glucose uptake is gradually being accepted. some studies have demonstrated inhibition of glut <dig> translocation or glucose uptake with the inhibitor of pld signalling, primary butanol  <cit> , whereas another reported no such effect  <cit> . the work by millar et al used a lower concentration of butanol and higher concentration of insulin than the other studies, thus it is possible that the stimulus was too great for the lower level of inhibitor to show an effect. insulin appears capable of stimulating pld activity  <cit> , although the issue is complicated by the suggestion that the alcohol used to measure pld activity may inhibit the insulin receptor  <cit> . pld can be activated by arf family proteins  <cit>  and brefeldin a, which can inhibit the gtp loading of certain arf proteins, inhibits insulin stimulation of pld  <cit> . increasing cellular levels of pld protein by microinjection or viral transfection potentiates glut <dig> translocation in response to insulin  <cit> . decreasing pld <dig> levels with sirna reduces glut <dig> exposure at the cell surface by affecting fusion, but not translocation or docking of the glut4-containing vesicles. together these studies suggest an ill-defined role for pld in the fusion of glut4-containing vesicles at the plasma membrane.

the phage display technique used in this study identified a motif present in glut <dig>  but absent in other glut family members that are not thought to be regulated by pld. thus the potential ptdoh-binding motif was investigated for its involvement in insulin-stimulated glut <dig> translocation. we present here results showing that mutation of this motif impairs exposure of glut <dig> at the surface of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes, via an effect on fusion of glut4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane.

RESULTS
screening by phage display
potential phosphatidic acid -binding motifs were identified by phage display using a randomised 12-mer phage library. phage were panned over plastic and phosphatidylcholine-coated surfaces to remove non-specific hydrophobic surface-binding phage before incubation on the ptdoh-coated surface. phage bound to the ptdoh surface were eluted with glycerol-3-phosphate which resembles the ptdoh headgroup to increase specificity of selection. sequencing the resulting ptdoh-selected phage demonstrated a variety of 12-mer peptides consisting of predominantly hydrophobic and basic residues, in agreement with the characteristics of known ptdoh-binding sites such as raf- <dig> kinase and p47-phox. the peptides were used as blast queries searching specifically for short nearly exact matches; this analysis returned a number of potential ptdoh-binding proteins. notably, using the two resulting phage sequences flksqwldrmlg and llksqwldrmlg, the search identified the sequence sqwl-r – ml present in the solute transporter glut <dig>  a sequence conserved in human, rat, mouse, pig and bovine genes. this was chosen for further study as glut <dig> translocation in response to insulin is believed to involve phospholipase d  signalling. the putative ptdoh-binding motif, sqwl, is located in the first intracellular loop of glut <dig>  proximal to the third transmembrane helix and suitably placed to mediate interactions with a membrane lipid molecule. notably, the other members of this solute transporter family, which are not thought to be regulated by pld, do not contain this sqwl motif .

mutation of the sqwl motif permits translocation of glut4
to allow assessment of glut <dig> translocation, glut <dig> containing an ha-tag in the first exofacial loop was tagged with gfp at the c-terminus. this allows cell surface-exposed glut <dig> to be measured relative to the total level of exogenous protein expressed, by comparing the ratio of ha to gfp in non-permeabilised cells. figure 2a demonstrates that insulin stimulates the translocation of this double-tagged glut <dig> to the plasma membrane in transfected cells. 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes were also transfected with a dual-tagged glut <dig> in which the putative ptdoh-binding motif, sqwl, had been mutated to alanine residues; insulin was still able to stimulate translocation of this transporter, as assessed by confocal microscopy . similar data was obtained using transfected l <dig> myoblasts .

mutation of the sqwl motif reduces glut <dig> cell surface exposure in response to insulin
to quantify the degree of glut <dig> exposure at the cell surface, we used the ratio of cell surface-exposed ha epitope signal to whole cell gfp signal. this effectively normalises the level of ha signal to the level of exogenous protein expressed in the cell, and therefore allows comparison of one cell with another. quantification of the ha:gfp signal ratio from confocal microscope images of transfected adipocytes showed that wild type glut4ha-gfp demonstrated a five-fold increase in glut <dig> exposure at the cell surface in response to insulin. in contrast the mutated glut <dig> showed a decreased response to insulin, 20% ± 3%  lower than for the wild type protein .

these images were then subjected to a more detailed analysis, in which the ratio of ha:gfp within a region of interest corresponding exclusively to the plasma membrane was measured. this provides an indication of the efficiency by which glut <dig> that has translocated to the plasma membrane is inserted into the membrane leaflet , and effectively normalises the ha signal to the level of glut4ha-gfp that has translocated to the membrane region to allow comparison between different cells. analysis of the 4a mutant glut <dig> cells  showed that the mutation most likely affects fusion of glut4-containing vesicles at the cell surface, since the ratio of ha:gfp in the plasma membrane was lower than for the wild type protein . in contrast, the mutation had no significant effect on the insulin-stimulated translocation of glut <dig> to the plasma membrane region, as indicated by the ratio of plasma membrane gfp:whole cell gfp signal .

discussion
insulin-induced glucose uptake via increased translocation of glut <dig> is believed to require pld activity. evidence for the role of pld in insulin signalling has come from various methods, including treatment with the arf inhibitor brefeldin a  <cit> , microinjection or viral transfection of pld  <cit> , and pld sirna  <cit> . the sirna study indicated a role for pld specifically at the plasma membrane, regulating fusion of the glut4-containing vesicles at the cell surface.

there are several points at which pld signalling could regulate glut <dig> cell surface expression. firstly, ptdoh is a fusogenic lipid, promoting increased membrane curvature  <cit> , so ptdoh generation may favour increased membrane curvature to allow fusion of glut <dig> vesicles to occur. secondly, ptdoh may have a more defined role in signalling to regulate glut <dig> vesicle fusion. for example, fusion of glut4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane involves formation of a trans snare complex between the v-snare vamp <dig> and the t-snares syntaxin- <dig> and snap <dig>  which is later recycled by the proposed ptdoh-binding protein nsf. pld-generated ptdoh could stimulate the atpase activity of nsf to increase recycling of snare complex components and increase vesicle fusion. ptdoh also stimulates phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase and atypical protein kinase cζ activity, both enzymes involved in exocytosis  <cit> . as unc <dig>  the c. elegans homologue of munc <dig> involved in exocytosis, binds diacylglycerol  <cit> , increased phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase activity could lead to increased dag formation by phospholipase c and thereby regulate exocytosis via munc <dig>  additionally, overexpression of pkcζ potentiates insulin-stimulated glut <dig> translocation and glucose uptake via interaction with munc18c  <cit> . munc18c binds syntaxin- <dig>  inhibiting interactions between syntaxin- <dig> and vamp <dig>  this inhibition can be relieved by insulin-stimulated interaction of pkcζ with munc18c, enabling fusion to occur. thus increased ptdoh levels could increase vesicle docking, tethering and fusion by a range of mechanisms. here we have investigated a novel third hypothesis for regulation of glut <dig> translocation by pld-generated ptdoh, a direct interaction of ptdoh with the glut <dig> protein.

phage display, a well-established technique for identifying novel protein-ligand interaction motifs  <cit> , highlighted a potential ptdoh-binding motif in the glut <dig> first intracellular loop. mutation of this sequence reduced the insulin-induced exposure of glut <dig> at the cell surface of 3t3-l <dig> adipocytes by affecting fusion of the glut4-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. it was not possible to directly experimentally measure ptdoh binding by glut <dig> protein, so an interaction between ptdoh and the sqwl motif in vivo cannot be definitively demonstrated. since glut <dig> is a transmembrane protein, any additional specific protein-lipid interactions need not be sufficiently high affinity to enable detection of such interactions, as in vivo the proposed binding site would already be in close proximity to the lipid.

inhibition of pld activity by sirna has been shown to reduce fusion of glut <dig> vesicles. this can be rescued by addition of lyso-phosphatidylcholine, another fusogenic lipid. simply favouring membrane curvature by the addition of fusogenic lipids may be sufficient to overcome the energy barrier associated with vesicle fusion in an experimental system, but more specific mechanisms may function in vivo. the current work suggests that fusion of glut4-contining vesicles with the plasma membrane is facilitated by a change in glut <dig> conformation upon binding to ptdoh, such that glut <dig> is better recognised by other regulators of vesicle fusion and/or allowing adoption of increased membrane curvature necessary for the formation of the fusion pore intermediate. the conformation of membrane-associated proteins has previously been shown to regulate membrane curvature, e.g. the bar domain of endophilin stabilises membrane curvature via a number of electrostatic interactions  <cit> , and the gtpase sar1p promotes membrane curvature by insertion of an amphipathic α-helix into the membrane  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here demonstrate the identification of a potential ptdoh-binding site by phage display, in the first intracellular loop of glut <dig>  mutation of this site is capable of modulating the efficiency of glut4-containing vesicle fusion. it remains to be shown how this motif regulates fusion, whether by favouring membrane curvature or recognition of the vesicle by other trafficking regulators. this region is unique to glut <dig> among the sugar transporters and thus may point to a unique mechanism of regulation involving lipid signalling.
