BACKGROUND
the atp-binding cassette  gene family encodes membrane-spanning proteins that transport a wide variety of substrates  across cell membranes. abc transporters are ubiquitous in all organisms from prokaryotes to eukaryotes . most abc proteins contain an atp-binding domain  and a transmembrane domain . the highly conserved nbd contains walker a, walker b, and abc signature motifs. the nbd binds and hydrolyses atp, providing energy for substrate transport. the tmd consists of five to six membrane spanning helices that determine substrate specificity  <cit> . eukaryotic abc transporters are either full transporters with all the required domains in one polypeptide chain , or half transporters  that form homo- or heterodimers as the functional units .

abc proteins have been divided into eight distinct subfamilies  based on the features of their nbds. subfamily h, which is closely related to subfamily g, was first identified in fruit fly  and later found in insects and zebrafish , but is absent from plant, worm, yeast, and mammalian genomes  <cit> . the remaining seven subfamilies  have been named abc <dig>  mdr/tap, cftr/mrp, ald, oabp, gcn <dig>  and white, respectively  <cit> . abc transporters can also be classified functionally as exporters, importers, and non-transport proteins. the exporters and importers are essential for transporting diverse biological substances, whereas the non-transport proteins  are involved mainly in ribosome biogenesis and translation regulation .

many abc transporters associated with disease processes have been studied extensively in animal models. abcb <dig>  was the first eukaryotic abc transporter to be identified on the surface of cancer cells  <cit>  where it acts as a multidrug resistance  efflux transporter that prevents the accumulation of chemotherapeutic drugs inside cancer cells. some abc genes have been associated with hereditary diseases such as cystic fibrosis caused by mutations in abcc7/cftr , adrenoleukodystrophy  caused by mutations in abcd <dig>  and cholesterol metabolism disorders caused by mutations in abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  and abcc <dig>  <cit> .

the abc transporter family with a total of  <dig> members was first systematically characterized in human   <cit> . the abc transporter genes in mouse  and fruit fly genomes have been analyzed jointly with their counterparts in the human genome  <cit> . subsequently, genome-wide analyses of abc genes have been performed in the nematode caenorhabditis elegans  <cit> , several arthropod species including mosquito   <cit> , silkworm , the beetle tribolium castaneum, honeybee  , water flea   <cit> , spider mite   <cit> , and several fish species including the channel catfish ictalurus punctatus  <cit> .

the evolution of the abc transporter genes has been investigated within the jawed vertebrate lineage   <cit> , but not in the jawless vertebrate lineage . jawless vertebrates diverge from the jawed vertebrates near  <dig> million years ago  <cit> , and differ from gnathostomes by a single medially-located nostril and a notochord that persists in adults. jawless vertebrates also lack hinged jaws, a mineralized skeleton, paired appendages, a pancreas, and spleen  <cit> .

the draft genomes of two lamprey species, the sea lamprey petromyzon marinus and japanese lamprey lethenteron japonicum, have been released recently  <cit> . these genome data provide resources for investigating abc gene evolution in early vertebrates. in this study, we conducted a genome-wide survey of the abc gene family in sea lamprey and japanese lamprey, and identified  <dig> abc transporters. phylogenetic analyses divided these abc genes into seven subfamilies. we also obtained the abc gene expression levels in various tissues across different developmental stages in sea lamprey by high-throughput rna sequencing . the patterns of abc gene expansion or contraction were discussed in the context of chordate evolution.

RESULTS
identification, characterization, and phylogenetic analysis of abc transporters
the sea lamprey genome is characterized by having many chromosomes , and is highly repetitive, heterozygous, and gc-rich  <cit> . the genome was found to undergo programmed genome rearrangements during early embryogenesis, resulting in the deletion of about 20 % of the germline dna from somatic tissues  <cit> . thus, the sea lamprey genome sequences that have been published are more fragmented and cover fewer genes than the genome encodes. therefore, we assembled a sea lamprey transcriptome from  <dig> rna-seq samples of various tissues across different developmental stages  that greatly improved the percentage of genes covered. in addition, a draft genome assembly of the japanese lamprey has been generated recently with dna from the testis  <cit> , thereby avoiding the dna deletion that takes place in somatic tissues.

the abc genes were identified independently in the sea lamprey and japanese lamprey genomes. these sea lamprey and japanese lamprey abc gene sequences have been deposited in genbank and are presented in the additional file  <dig>  respectively. a total of  <dig> abc transporter genes were identified in the lampreys and  <dig> more abc transporter genes were identified in this study compared with the previous analysis in liu et al  <cit>  . the lengths of mrna and protein sequences, cds status, domain structure, and genbank accession numbers are summarized in table  <dig>  the phylogenetic analyses grouped the  <dig> transporter genes into seven subfamilies : namely, seven abcas,  <dig> abcbs,  <dig> abccs, three abcds, one abce, three abcfs, and three abcgs . the abch subfamily member that was present in zebrafish was not found in the lamprey genomes. in the phylogenetic analyses, the sea squirts ciona intestinalis and c. savignyi that represent a non-vertebrate chordate lineage were chosen as the outgroups. detailed evolutionary and phylogenetic analyses of the abc genes in lampreys were conducted for each subfamily as described below.table  <dig> details of  <dig> abc transporter genes and the translated proteins identified in lampreys

abca subfamily
seven abca genes were identified in the sea lamprey and japanese lamprey including abca1a, abca1b, abca2–abca <dig>  and abca <dig>  these genes all encode full transporter proteins, except abca1b, which lacks a nbd because of incomplete sequence . abca1b and abca <dig> were not found in the previous study by liu et al  <cit>  and most of the identified abca genes were short fragments and less than half their full length . the phylogenetic analysis supported the member assignment for the lamprey abca subfamily and the seven abca proteins clustered with their counterparts from other species .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abca subfamily transporters. amino acid sequences were aligned using clustalx  <dig>  and the multiple alignment was used to construct the phylogenetic tree using mega <dig> with  <dig> bootstrap replicates. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using a maximum likelihood method with the jones–taylor–thornton  substitution model. the lamprey abca proteins are highlighted with red dots



the lamprey abca1a and abca1b proteins clustered with members of the abca <dig> and abca <dig> from human, mouse and zebrafish. this large clade then clustered with the abca <dig> group with sea squirt abca <dig> members at the base of the whole clade . the abca <dig> and abca <dig> members from gnathostomes appear as paralogs derived from abca <dig> duplication because two abca <dig> members from the lampreys were at the base of the clade. two copies of both abca <dig> and abca <dig> encoded in zebrafish may be derived from fish-specific genome duplication because they are also present in most teleost fish  <cit> . abca <dig> appears before the speciation of lampreys and is generally conserved in vertebrates, but has not been found in some teleost fish examined  <cit> .

sea squirt abca <dig> proteins were placed at the basal position of the clade including the vertebrate abca <dig> group, and the mouse abca14–abca <dig> group, and abca <dig> . this finding implies that mouse abca14–abca <dig> may be derived from the duplication of abca <dig>  the gene arrangement analysis also suggested that they evolved by gene duplication. in the mouse genome, the first exons of abca <dig> and abca <dig> overlap and are transcribed from opposite strands  <cit> . abca14–abca <dig> are arranged in a tandem head-to-tail cluster on a mouse chromosome and this arrangement is also present in the rat and dog genomes but only the gene fragments of abca14–abca <dig> remain in human genome  <cit> . abca <dig> is present in the genomes of all four vertebrates examined  while abca <dig> is present only in the human and mouse genomes .

abca <dig> is conserved throughout all chordates, as indicated by the phylogenetic analysis. in a large clade, the abca <dig> proteins of sea squirts and lamprey were placed at the base whereas the abca5s of human, mouse, and zebrafish clustered together in a subclade that included abca <dig>  abca <dig>  and abca <dig> proteins from both mouse and human, as well as a abca <dig> from human . no counterparts for the abca5-related genes  were identified in lamprey, zebrafish, or other teleost fish  <cit> . these abca5-related genes in the human, dog , and mouse  were arranged in a cluster with abca <dig> on the same chromosomes  <cit> . other abca5-related genes that clustered with abca <dig> have also been found on chicken and xenopus chromosomes  <cit> . the phylogenetic and syntenic analyses imply that abca <dig> is evolutionarily conserved and the additions of abca5-related genes occurred and expanded through gene duplication after the teleost split with the other vertebrates  <cit> .

in summary, most of the abca genes identified in this study were full length after concatenation of the two lamprey sequences and two more abca genes were identified than liu et al  <cit> . sea squirts have three members in the abca subfamily whereas lamprey and zebrafish have seven and nine, respectively. however, mouse and human possess up to  <dig> and  <dig> members, respectively. this finding clearly implies that the abca subfamily has undergone expansion through high-frequency gene duplication during chordate evolution.

abcb subfamily
a total of  <dig> abcb genes were identified in lampreys including abcb <dig>  abcb5–abcb <dig>  abcb1-like, and abcb10-like. four of these genes, abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  abcb1-like, and abcb10-like were not found by liu et al  <cit>  and most of the gene sequences were shorter than the full length gene sequences identified in the present study. furthermore, in the previous study abcb <dig> was fragmented into two segments that were annotated mistakenly as “abcb4” and “abcb5” . the abcb subfamily includes both full and half transporters. the abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  and abcb <dig> proteins are full transporters while abcb1-like is an incomplete sequence that lacks a nbd. the remaining proteins, abcb6–abcb <dig> and abcb10-like are half transporters . compared with the human genome with  <dig> abcb transporter genes, lampreys lacked abcb2–abcb <dig>  however, two additional genes, abcb1-like and abcb10-like were identified in lampreys .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abcb subfamily transporters. the phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  the lamprey abcb proteins are highlighted with red dots



as shown in the phylogenetic tree , abcb <dig> is absent in sea squirts, lampreys, and zebrafish. in addition, the lamprey abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> proteins fell into a large subclade that included the abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  and abcb <dig> proteins from human, mouse, and zebrafish. this large subclade then grouped with the subclade of five predicted abcb1-like proteins from sea squirts. this finding implies that the abcb1-like genes in sea squirts underwent significant gene loss such that one member remained after the divergence of lampreys with sea squirts or that abcb1-like underwent ciona-specific duplications. gene duplications also occurred and gave rise to new abcb members such as abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> in the human and mouse genomes are co-orthologous to abcb <dig> in the fish genomes, which was confirmed by a genomic syntenic analysis that showed that abcb <dig> occurred by duplication of abcb <dig> in mammals, estimated to be  <dig> million years ago, after the split of mammals from birds and reptiles  <cit> . an additional study also showed that abcb <dig>  abcb <dig>  and abcb <dig> were closely related and shared a common ancestor in chordate history  <cit> . abcb <dig> was thought to be specific to mammalian genomes  <cit> , but was later discovered in non-mammalian genomes including teleost, birds, lizards, and xenopus  <cit> . here, we found that abcb <dig> appeared much earlier in the vertebrate lineage, in the lampreys.

abcb6–abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> are more conserved than other members of the abcb subfamily in chordate, as indicated by their presence in genomes from sea squirt to human. furthermore, fish-specific genome duplication and species-specific duplication may have led to the emergence of abcb6b and abcb11b respectively in zebrafish , as determined from an examination of abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> in teleost fish genome  <cit> . the abcb <dig>  and abcb3/tap <dig> were not found in either sea squirts or lampreys, but are present in zebrafish and species that evolved later. the abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> proteins deliver peptides to the endoplasmic reticulum to form class i major histocompatibility complex  molecules  <cit> , which controls a major part of the immune system in all vertebrates. mhcs display antigens on the cell surface for recognition by the appropriate t-cells. thus, abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> are link to gnathostomes adaptive immune system. the timing of abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> appearance parallels the emergence of an adaptive immune system in gnathostomes. in lampreys, two additional abcb1-like and abcb10-like genes, named based on the highest similarity of their encoded proteins to the abcb <dig> and abcb <dig> proteins of mouse in blastp searches, were not well resolved in the phylogenetic analyses.

abcc subfamily
ten abcc genes were identified in lampreys, including abcc <dig>  abcc <dig>  abcc3a, abcc3b, abcc <dig>  abcc <dig>  and abcc7–abcc <dig>  all of which encode full abc transporters . only five of the  <dig> abcc subfamily members were found in the previous study by liu et al  <cit> . moreover, the abcc <dig> fragment was mistakenly annotated as “abcc4”, the short fragment of abcc <dig> was mistakenly annotated as “abcc8-2”, and abcc <dig> was fragmented into two segments that were annotated as “abcc10-1” and “abcc10-2” . of the  <dig> abcc members in human, abcc <dig>  abcc <dig>  and abcc <dig> were not found in the lampreys. in general, the phylogenetic analyses supported the names assigned to the abcc genes in the lampreys . most lamprey abcc proteins were positioned at the base of their respective clades with orthologous proteins from other species. sea squirt abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> did not form separate clusters with orthologous genes from other species, but clustered with each other and then grouped with the subclade of abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> from other species. no abcc <dig> was found in sea squirts, but it was exclusively duplicated in lampreys. no abcc <dig> was identified in either sea squirts or lampreys. however, three copies of abcc <dig> were found in the zebrafish genome. inferred from the phylogenetic tree, abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> in sea squirts may be the ancestral genes of abcc1–abcc <dig> and abcc6; abcc <dig> appeared after lampreys split with teleosts.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abcc subfamily transporters. the phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  the lamprey abcc proteins are highlighted with red dots



three zebrafish abcc <dig> proteins first grouped with human and mouse abcc8s and then clustered with the abcc <dig> subclade. lamprey abcc <dig> was placed at the root of the clade. no abcc <dig> or abcc <dig> genes were identified in sea squirts. these results suggested that abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> may have appeared after the speciation of sea squirts but before the speciation of lampreys. sea squirt abcc <dig> is positioned at the base of the clade that includes abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> proteins from all the species, except for lamprey abcc <dig>  abcc <dig> may have been derived from the duplication of abcc <dig> and then underwent an independent gene loss in lampreys, or it was simply not found in the current incomplete lamprey draft genomes.

abcc <dig> was closely related to abcc <dig>  which is not found in sea squirts but present in lampreys. both abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> were not present in lampreys. abcc <dig> was found to have been duplicated tandemly from abcc <dig> in human  <cit> . abcc <dig> is present in zebrafish and is still functionally present in chicken, dog, and macaque, but is inactive in human, great apes, and mouse  <cit> .

abcd subfamily
all members of the abcd subfamily are half transporters located in the peroxisome with one tmd and one nbd  <cit> . all the genes in this subfamily are highly conserved in vertebrates and have undergone very few duplication or loss events. three out of the four members of abcd subfamily, abcd2–abcd <dig>  were identified in both sea squirts and lampreys; abcd <dig> was not found by liu et al . the phylogenetic tree supports the assignment of abcd <dig>  abcd <dig>  and abcd <dig> in lampreys . abcd <dig> was not identified in either lampreys or sea squirts. the abcd <dig> subclade clustered with the abcd <dig> proteins of human, mouse, zebrafish, and lamprey, with the sea squirt abcd <dig> positioned at the base of the clade. the phylogenetic tree indicates that abcd <dig> originated from the duplication of abcd <dig> before the divergence of lamprey with gnathostome and then underwent an independent gene loss in the lamprey lineage. alternatively, abcd <dig> is present in the lamprey genome but was not found in the current incomplete lamprey genome assemblies. abcd <dig> had a single copy in lampreys, mouse, and human; but underwent duplication in fish-specific lineage including zebrafish and catfish  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abcd subfamily transporters. the phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  the lamprey abcd proteins are highlighted with red dots



abce and abcf subfamilies
the abce and abcf subfamilies consist of genes containing two nbds with no tmds . members of the abce and abcf subfamilies were highly conserved in chordates; and each of the members identified in sea squirts was positioned at the base of the corresponding subclade. all the abce and abcf members were identified by liu et al, but abcf <dig> was split into two fragments and named “abcf3-1” and “abcf3-2” . the phylogenetic analysis supported the gene name assignment in lamprey. each member of the abce and abcf subfamilies was present as a single-copy gene in most species. however, in some teleost fish, the members possessed more copies as a result of gene duplication; for example, there are two abcf <dig> genes in zebrafish , and two abce <dig> and abcf <dig> genes in catfish  <cit> .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abce and abcf subfamily transporters. the phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  the lamprey abce and abcf proteins are highlighted with red dots



abcg subfamily
all the abcg transporters in metazoans are half transporters. unlike other half transporters, the abcgs have a reverse domain structure with a nbd at the n-terminus and a tmd at the c-terminus. only three members, abcg2a, abcg2b, and abcg <dig> were found in lampreys, and abcg2b was missed by liu et al . in human, mouse, and zebrafish, the abcg subfamily contains at least five members, abcg <dig>  abcg <dig>  abcg <dig>  abcg <dig>  and abcg <dig>  in addition, abcg <dig> was present in mouse, and four copies of abcg <dig> and two copies of abcg <dig> were present in zebrafish .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of abcg subfamily transporters. the phylogenetic tree was constructed as described in the legend to fig.  <dig>  the lamprey abcg proteins are highlighted with red dots



notably, five abcg1-like genes were identified in sea squirts, which are rooted at the clade composed of the abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> subclades . these data suggested that abcg <dig> was derived from the duplication of the abcg1-like <dig> gene before the speciation of lampreys and the remaining abcg1-like genes have undergone gene loss during vertebrate evolution. abcg <dig> was not found in lamprey, suggesting that this gene may have been lost independently in the lamprey lineage or was not found because of the incomplete lamprey genome assembly.

abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> arose from a common ancestral gene as evidenced from the head-to-head arrangement on a chromosome and the encoded proteins form a functional heterodimer  <cit> . the abcg <dig> and abcg <dig> proteins clustered together in the phylogenetic tree without orthologs in the lampreys and sea squirts. two abcg <dig> members were identified in both sea squirts and lampreys and four abcg <dig> were present in zebrafish. the abcg <dig> proteins in both lamprey and zebrafish were separated into two subclades; one abcg <dig> in lampreys and two abcg2s in zebrafish formed one subclade with the abcg2-like <dig> gene in sea squirts. the abcg2s in human, mouse, lamprey, and zebrafish clustered with mouse abcg <dig> in the other subclade. furthermore, the abcg2-like <dig> protein in sea squirts was placed at the base of the clade . this result implies that the abcg <dig> genes derived from the abcg2-like <dig> in sea squirts underwent gene loss in the lineages after the divergence of teleost from other vertebrates. conversely, the abcg <dig> genes derived from abcg2-like <dig> in sea squirts remained and duplicated to give rise to abcg <dig> in mouse.

expression profiling of abc genes in tissues across different developmental stages
the expression levels of abc genes were determined in sea lamprey tissues, including mature male rope, adult lips, supraneural, neutrophils, monocytes, and adult male gill , and in tissues at different reproductive stages including prespermiating male gill , spermiating male gill , preovulatory female eye , preovulatory female tail skin , ovulatory female head skin , spermiating male head skin , and spermiating male muscle . in addition, the expression levels of abc genes in the intestine, kidney, and liver tissues across different developmental stages including larvae , metamorphosis , juvenile, parasite ,and adult stages were analyzed .fig.  <dig> heat map of expression levels of  <dig> abc genes of sea lamprey. gene expression levels in various tissues across different developmental stages are shown. a colored scale at the bottom of the figure shows the corresponding reads per million  log <dig> values. gene expression levels are shown after log <dig> data transformation



the rna-seq data showed that all  <dig> abc genes were expressed  in at least one of the tissues . the abce and abcf subfamily genes were ubiquitously and highly expressed in all the tested tissues. abcb <dig> and abcc <dig> were also ubiquitously and highly expressed, implying that these genes may play important roles in biological process in sea lamprey. other genes were differentially expressed across various tissues. within the same tissue, most of the abc genes were highly expressed at the larval stage and stages after metamorphosis, but relatively lowly expressed at metamorphosis stages.

extensive functional studies of the abc genes have been performed in human and mouse, but few studies have been carried out in lampreys  <cit> . abca <dig> and abca <dig> are best studied members of the abca subfamily. in mammals, the abca <dig> protein is required for cholesterol efflux transport from peripheral cells into high-density lipoproteins particles  <cit> . the lamprey possessed two orthologs of abca <dig>  abca1a, and abca1b. abca1a was ubiquitously and highly expressed in all tissues, especially in the tissues at the adult and mature stages, whereas abca1b was highly expressed in the gill tissue . the abca <dig> protein, also known as photoreceptor rim protein  or abcr, was expressed exclusively in the retina and is localized in the outer segment disk edges of rod photoreceptors  <cit> . indeed, it is highly expressed in pofeye  and in intestine at m <dig> and m <dig> , and is especially highly expressed in the small parasite stages . this finding implies that the abca <dig> protein may perform multiple functions in early vertebrates and may have evolved to perform retina-specific function in mammals   <cit> . the abca <dig> protein appears to be essential for normal development of the skin. several mutations in this gene have been reported to lead to severe skin disorders such as harlequin ichthyosis and lamellar ichthyosis type  <dig> in human  <cit> . although the exact function of abca <dig> is unknown, it probably plays an important role in transporting lipids into the cells that make up the epidermis  <cit> . abca <dig> is highly expressed in lip , adult gill , and intestines at m <dig> and m <dig> stages . it is also differentially expressed in different intestine regions at the small parasitic stage ,  <dig> rpm; and small parasite proximal intestine ,  <dig> rpm).

abcb <dig>  functions in exporting foreign substances out of cells. the lamprey genomes contain two members of the abcb <dig> gene, abcb <dig> and abcb1-like. abcb <dig> showed no or low expression in all the tissues tested, whereas abcb1-like was highly expressed in intestine at the early stages of metamorphosis, m0–m <dig> , and at the small parasite and adult stages , as well as in kidney at the small parasite and adult stages . in human, abcb <dig> was expressed mainly in normal skin and malignant melanoma  <cit> , while abcb <dig> was expressed in lamprey kidney and gill, with the highest expression level  in psmgill.

the four half transporters, abcb6– abcb <dig> and abcb <dig>  were localized in mitochondria where they were reported to function in iron metabolism and transport of fe/s protein precursors  <cit> . abcb <dig> was ubiquitously expressed  in all tissues and highly expressed in muscle  and in intestines at the early metamorphic stages m <dig> and m <dig> , as well as in the small parasite stage . abcb <dig> was also ubiquitously expressed  in all tissues. abcb <dig> was highly expressed  in lips, gills, sppi, and kidneys at metamorphic stages of m <dig>  m <dig>  and m <dig>  and at the small parasite and adult stages. abcb <dig> was highly expressed in gills , in intestine at stages of m <dig> , and adult , and in kidney at the small parasite and adult stages . the expression pattern of abcb10-like was different from that of abcb <dig>  in addition, abcb10-like was highly expressed in muscle and kidneys at metamorphic stages. abcb <dig> , is responsible for the transport of taurocholate and other cholate conjugates from hepatocytes to the bile. however, abcb <dig> was not expressed specifically in liver, but was also expressed in kidney  <cit>  and, in general, we found that abcb <dig> was expressed at very low levels in most tissues, but was highly expressed in adult kidney and juvenile liver . this may be a compensatory mechanism in post-metamorphic lamprey that have lost the biliary tree  <cit> .

abcc <dig> was expressed at low levels in all tissues; its highest expression levels were in sppi and gills . abcc <dig> was expressed at relative high levels in all the tested tissues, and was especially high in neutrophils , psmgill , and in intestines at stages of m <dig>  m <dig>  small parasite, and adult . in addition, abcc <dig> was highly expressed in kidney and liver after metamorphosis. two copies of abcc <dig>  abcc3a, and abcc3b in lampreys were lowly expressed in all tissues. the highest expression levels  of these genes were in rope, gill, and juvenile liver. abcc <dig> was highly expressed in lips  and smhs , and differentially expressed in different intestine regions at the small parasite stages . abcc <dig> was ubiquitously and highly expressed in all tissues with the highest level in pofeye . abcc7/cftr encodes an ion channel that transports chloride and thiocyanate ions across epithelial cell membranes  <cit> . its expression levels were generally low in all tissues except for larval intestine . abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> function as modulators of atp-sensitive potassium channels and for insulin release  <cit> . the expression levels of both abcc <dig> and abcc <dig> were generally low in all tissues. abcc <dig>  which encodes a protein whose functions are unclear, was highly expressed in all tissues, especially in larval kidney .

abcd homodimers are involved in the transport of very long chain acyl-coa into the peroxisome  <cit> . abcd <dig> was broadly expressed and its expression was especially high in lips , pofeye , muscle , and intestine at larva  and juvenile  stages. its expression was relatively low in intestine and kidney at metamorphosis stages, but higher in liver at larval and metamorphic stages . abcd <dig> is highly expressed in gill, intestine, and kidney at larval and post-metamorphic stages and in liver at all stages. the expression of abcd <dig> was generally low in all tissues, but in psmgill and intestine its expression was more than  <dig> rpm at larva and parasitic stages.

abce <dig>  abcf <dig>  and abcf <dig> were ubiquitously and highly expressed in all tissues. the gene expression patterns were consistent with the fundamental and essential functions of the encoded proteins in ribosome biogenesis and translation regulation . the highest expression levels of abce <dig> were found in adult intestine and kidney . abcf <dig> was also ubiquitously expressed, but its expression was generally lower compared with abce <dig>  and abcf <dig>  and abcf <dig> 

the lamprey genomes contained two copies of abcg <dig>  abcg2a was highly expressed in gills and kidney at m <dig> and m <dig> stages and the highest expression was found in intestine . abcg2b showed high expression in intestine and kidney at larval stage and the highest levels were found in liver at larval and metamorphic stages . abcg <dig> was not expressed in all the tissues.

CONCLUSIONS
the first comprehensive analysis of abc transporter genes were carried out in a primitive vertebrate lineage, the lampreys. a total of  <dig> abc transporter genes were identified. thirteen more abc transporter genes were identified compared with a previous study. through the concatenation of the gene sequences from two lamprey species, full length abc transporter sequences were obtained, which significantly improved the resolution of the name assignment and phylogenetic position for the genes compared with a previous analysis in which sequence fragments were used. in chordates, the abc transporter gene subfamilies have undergone obvious expansion or contraction. the abca subfamily showed the highest gene expansion rate during chordate evolution. all the genes in the abcd, abce and abcf subfamilies were highly conserved in the chordates. the evolution of abc transporters in lampreys needs to be evaluated further because the results presented here are based on a draft genome.
