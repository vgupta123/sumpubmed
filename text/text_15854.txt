BACKGROUND
the generation of immune responses requires the interaction of rare antigen-specific t lymphocytes  with dendritic cell  presenting the appropriate antigen. the spontaneous interaction between them is rare in the body and only occurs in specific structures, namely the secondary lymphoid organs   <cit> . the interactions are highly dependent on their architecture  <cit> . slos contain several compartments characterized by specific resident stromal cells. the most important compartments are the b-cell and t-cell zones. the b-cell zone is composed of follicular dendritic cells , which produce cxcl <dig> to attract b cells  <cit> . the t-cell zone  is rich in fibroblastic reticular cells  that express the chemokine ligands ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> to attract naive t cells and dcs  <cit> .

fdcs are well-established players in the b-cell responses, but the importance of t-zone frcs in adaptive immunity has been noticed only recently. frcs can secrete abundant extracellular matrix  and form specialized conduits that transport small molecules to the t zone  <cit> . frcs enwrap these conduits to form a 3-dimensional cellular scaffold that allows dcs to adhere and recirculate t cells to migrate along, thereby improving the probability of successful encounters between activated dcs and naive t cells  <cit> .

previous studies suggest that reduced expression of the homeostatic chemokines in lymphoid tissues will inhibit the aggregation of t cells and dcs in the t-cell zone in slos and thereby lower the probability of encounter between antigen-specific t cells and dcs, thus weakening the immune response intensity  <cit> . besides ccl19/ <dig>  frcs also produce interleukin - <dig> to promote the survival of naive t-cells  <cit> . past studies focus on the effects of frcs on t cells, but not on the effects of t cells on frcs, which is mainly studied in the field of hiv infection. earlier studies on hiv infection indicate that t cell absence could decrease the il- <dig> secretion by frcs, thereby further precluding the survival of t cells  <cit> . however, there is no report about whether t cells can affect the secretion of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> by frcs. previous investigations showed that virus could spread in an uncontrolled fashion in ltb–/– mice  <cit> ; that expression of il- <dig> in frcs from lt-b knockout mice was significantly down-regulated  <cit> ; and that lt-b is mainly expressed in t cells  <cit> , which together suggest that the frc-regulated t cells may also affect frcs through secretion of factors such as lymphotoxin -b.

in this study, with a spleen model, we comprehensively analyzed the morphology, organization and function of frcs in the absence of t cells. our results indicate that in the absence of t cells significant changes could occur, both, in the structure of frcs and in the secretion of ccl21/ <dig> by frcs, which is likely mediated through the expression of lt-b. these results suggest that t cells can play an important role in maintaining frc function and is probably achieved through lt-b.

RESULTS
the conduits of frcs were destroyed in the absence of t cells
we first histologically studied the effects of t cell absence on splenic frcs. frcs form specialized conduits in the spleen and t cells move along these conduits. these conduits guide the transfer of t cells from blood to the t-cell zone  <cit> . er-tr <dig> plays a key role in the formation of conduits and in the spleen, it is only secreted by frcs  <cit> . we found that the expression of er-tr <dig> was significantly downregulated in the spleens of nude mice . we also analyzed the average values of fluorescence, the results show that er-tr <dig> was significantly downregulated in the spleens of nude mice ; while in the spleen margins in balb/c mice, the er-tr <dig> formed a broad-banded structure which surrounded the t- and b-cell zones and was not present in the nude mice . these findings indicate that the in the absence of t cells frcs will undergo structural abnormality.figure  <dig>

t cell absence affected secretion of frc chemokine and homing of t cells
to further clarify whether the dysfunction of frcs occurs following the absence of t cells, we evaluated the expressions of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  which in the spleen were expressed only in the t-cell zone. ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were mainly secreted by frcs and were the key chemokines that induced the initial homing of t cells to the spleen  <cit> . their rna and protein expression levels all were significantly downregulated . subsequently, protein localization analysis with fluorescence microscopy also showed that the expressions of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were significantly downregulated . we also examined the homing ability of t cells to the spleen; and, after ascertaining its specific localization to the white pulps, found that the count of cfse-positive t cells in the splenic white pulps of nude mice was significantly reduced .figure  <dig>

transfusion of t cells recovered the splenic structure in nude mice 
we further examined whether transfusion of t cells would recover the splenic structure in nude mice. following the transfusion of about 2-3 × 107 t cells per week for 4 weeks, the proportions of cd8+ and cd4+ t-cells were greatly increased . moreover, the expression of splenic er-tr <dig> in nude mice was significantly improved and the structure was basically normal . we additionally evaluated the expression of gp <dig>  another marker of frcs, and it also was mostly recovered . the mrna and protein expressions of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were also largely increased after transfusion . in addition, the homing ability of t cells to the spleen white pulps was prominently enhanced . we also assessed the proportion of cfse-positive cells homing to the whole spleen using flow cytometry . the results show that the transfusion of t cells improved the homing ability of t cells to the spleen.figure  <dig> 
after transfusion of t cells, the proportion of t cells in the nude mice’s spleens greatly increased. naive t cells were purified and transferred into nude mice every week. after four weeks, percentages of cd8+and cd4+ t cells in spleen were determined by facs.
transfusion of t cells restored the structure of splenic frcs and could be blocked by the antibody against the lt-b receptors. naive t cells were purified and transferred into nude mice every week, after four week spleen cryostat sections from spleens of balb/c, nude mice, nude mice + tcells and nude mice + tcells + anti-ltbr, mice were stained for ccl <dig>  and er-tr <dig> . we further analyzed the average fluorescence values of both er-tr <dig> and ccl <dig> , rt-qpcr of chemokine expression in whole spleen of balb/c, nude mice,nude mice + tcells and nude mice + tcells + anti-ltbr, , chemokine expression in the spleen of balb/c, nude mice, nude mice + t cells and nude mice + tcells + anti-ltbr were quantified by elisa in tissue homogenates . gp <dig> expression in whole spleen of balb/c, nude mice, nude mice + t cells and nude mice + tcells + anti-ltbr detected by western blotting . data are representative of  <dig> mice per group.

participation of lt-b in structural reconstruction of frcs
previous research shows that loss of lt-b led to reduced secretion of il- <dig> from frcs. since lt-b is mainly secreted by t cells, we further investigated the mechanism through which lymphocytes could contribute to reconstruct frcs. we first analyzed the changes of lt-b mrna and protein expressions and found that the expression levels in nude mice were significantly lower than in balb/c mice . the transfusion of t cells could upregulate the expression levels of lt-b mrna and protein. during the transfusion, we blocked the lt-b receptor; however, the transfusion could not reconstruct the frcs in nude mice , or change the expressions of ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> , or restore the homing ability of t cells .figure  <dig>

discussion
in the absence of t cells splenic frcs undergo structural and functional abnormality, and the homing ability of t cells to the spleen weakens. transfusion of t cells can remodel the structure and functions of frcs and promote their recovery. these changes could be attributed to the t-cell-derived lt-b. past research shows that t cells are critical during the adaptive immune response, even though the t cells capable of identifying specific antigens are produced in the slos . the stromal cells  in the slos are critical for maintaining the structural functions of lymphoid organs and in the production of specific t cells.

earlier research about frcs focuses on their effects on t cells, as frcs maintain the homeostasis of t cells via the secretion of il- <dig>  <cit> . through their secretion of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  frcs also chemoattract t cells to the t-cell zone in the slos, and thus promote the encounter between t cells and antigen presenting cells. other studies suggest that b cells can regulate the secretion of ccl <dig> by frcs, and this occurs when mice are born  <cit> . research about the effects of t cells on frcs is limited, and mainly concerns hiv infection, but it is known that in the absence of lymphocyte secretion of il- <dig> by frcs is reduced and the homeostasis of t cells weakens . the present study showed that in the absence of lymphocyte, not only il- <dig>  but also the structural functions of frcs is significantly affected.

firstly, we found that the t cell absence led to significantly lower expression and abnormal distribution of er-tr <dig>  noteworthy, frcs in the slos will form conduits that are critical for regulation of t-cell-specific immune response  <cit> . these conduits are formed jointly by frcs and the frc-secreted ecm; especially, er-tr <dig> is a key ecm and in slos  <cit> , er-tr <dig> is only secreted by frcs. such conduits rapidly transport small molecules to the t-cell zone and also guide and support the migration of initial t cells to the t-cell zone  <cit> . as the codistribution of er-tr <dig> and frcs is highly consistent, er-tr <dig> is commonly used as a marker of frcs. the expression of er-tr <dig> is downregulated with the absence of t cells, especially in the marginal zone, indicating that the frc-formed conduits dissapeared in the absence of the t cell, probably further weakening the migration and survival of t cells in the spleen.

secondly, we found that in the absence of t cells the expressions of ccl <dig> and ccl21were downregulated. interestingly, previous reports show that when lacking expression of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> , naive t cells do not enter the t-cell zone efficiently  <cit> . similarly, in ccr7-deficient mice, the cognate receptor for these chemokines, naive t cells cannot enter the t-cell zone, indicating the crucial role of this molecular interaction in regulating the access of naive t cell to this region. in the absence of t cell, the changes of frc-secreted factors further weakened the homing ability of t cells. to validate this notion, we conducted the homing experiments, which yielded results that supported the above notion, as cells further damaged the homing ability of t cells and thereby weakened the immune response ability.

finally, we found that the t cell absence significantly downregulated the lt-b level in slos, indicating that the reduced expressions of ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> due to t cell absence probably were induced by the absence of lt-b. these results are consistent with previous findings showing that the expression of il- <dig> was significantly downregulated in the slos whose lt-b was knocked out and that lt-b was mainly secreted by t cells . we also blocked the lt-b receptor and found that the transfusion of t cells did not restore the structure and functions of the spleen. this result indicated that the absence of t-cell-derived lt-b was mainly responsible for the structural and functional abnormality observed in frcs after the t cell absence.

CONCLUSIONS
in the absence of t cell structural and functional abnormalities appear in splenic frcs of slos. the transfusion of t cells restored the structure and functions, mainly because of the t cell-derived lt-b.
