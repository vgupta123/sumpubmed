BACKGROUND
among mammals that are adapted to hypoxic environments, only subterranean species are also obliged to breathe air with elevated concentrations of carbon dioxide  <cit> . within this select group, the  <dig> or so species of fossorial moles  are among the few that live exclusively underground. these small  insectivores favour moist, invertebrate-rich substrates to excavate extensive closed-burrow systems. due to the impeded gas exchange of damp soils with surface air, these animals are chronically exposed to hypoxic and hypercapnic environments . the high metabolic costs of burrowing, in terms of o <dig> consumption and co <dig> production, are exacerbated by the obligate re-breathing of expired air while tunnelling, and may therefore require adaptive modifications in hemoglobin  function. not surprisingly, whole blood o <dig> affinity of the european mole, talpa europaea, is much higher  than those of terrestrial mammals of similar size  <cit> . this feature has been attributed to a reduced affinity of european mole hb for  <dig> -diphosphoglycerate   <cit> , which binds to a cluster of positively charged residues between the β-type chains and stabilizes the low affinity  conformation of the molecule. however, it is not known whether other fossorial members of the family talpidae possess similar specializations to the subterranean environment. this question is of interest in light of recent evidence which suggests that new world  and old world  moles have convergently invaded the subterranean habitat .

in order to assess the functional and evolutionary adaptations of mole hbs, and their mechanistic basis, we determined the coding sequences of the adult-expressed α-and β-type globin chains of coast mole  and eastern mole , two closely related, strictly fossorial species that are endemic to western and eastern north america, respectively, and we investigated the ligand-binding properties of their hb components. based on unexpected findings for s. aquaticus hb, we also measured oxygen-binding properties of whole blood for both species and the semi-aquatic star-nosed mole . to gauge whether the distinctive oxygenation properties of eastern mole hb are accompanied by complementary or compensatory physiological adjustments, we also measured hematological and muscle biochemical properties of the two fossorial species.

RESULTS
hb-o <dig> binding properties
both gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing  revealed the presence of two major isohb components  in all individuals examined , where the hb i:hb ii ratio approximated 60: <dig> and 35: <dig>  respectively. in addition to these major components, one of the eastern mole specimens possessed a minor cathodic hb component that represented ~5% of the hemolysate and exhibited oxygen-binding properties similar to those of the major components . preparative ief revealed relatively high isoelectric points  for the co-bound hb components of both species at 5°c .

oxygen equilibration curves revealed striking functional differences between the hbs of the two species , with 'stripped'  hbs of the eastern mole exhibiting p50's  that are nearly three-fold higher than those of the coast mole . eastern mole hbs also exhibited slightly lower chloride sensitivities , though the hbs of both species showed similar cooperativity coefficients . significantly, the o2-affinity of coast mole hbs was sharply reduced in the presence of saturating concentrations of dpg, a trait not observed in eastern mole hbs . even under saturating dpg concentrations the p <dig> of coast mole hbs  remained lower than those of eastern mole hbs in the absence of this organophosphate . similarly, oxygenation enthalpies  of coast mole hbs at ph  <dig>  and in  <dig>  m cl- media  were lower than those of eastern moles , though both were low compared to human hb a at ph  <dig>  .

o2-binding properties of whole blood
in accordance with the observed differences in the oxygen affinity of coast vs. eastern mole hb components in the presence of allosteric effectors , the p <dig> of freshly drawn coast mole blood  was substantially lower than that from the eastern mole , while that of the amphibious star-nosed mole was intermediate . however, whole blood ph was notably lower in eastern mole  than in the coast and star-nosed moles . even when corrected to ph  <dig> , a clear difference in whole-blood o2-affinity of these two fossorial species was evident . the co <dig> bohr coefficients  of blood from coast mole  and star-nosed mole  were within the typical mammalian range , while that of the eastern mole was unusually high . consistent with our hb data, the blood p <dig> values of both fossorial species showed low temperature sensitivities, with the hb-oxygenation reaction being less exothermic in coast mole  than in the eastern mole . surprisingly, blood-o <dig> affinity of the semi-aquatic star-nosed mole was more strongly governed by temperature , as reflected by its high oxygenation enthalpy  relative to the fossorial mole species.

prominent differences were also detected in specific hematological parameters of the two fossorial species, with the most significant being the >  <dig> fold lower dpg levels in the erythrocytes of eastern mole relative to coast mole . tissue myoglobin concentration was also consistently lower in eastern moles , although this difference was only significant for hindlimb muscles. conversely, hematocrit and hb concentrations were  <dig> % and  <dig> % higher, respectively, in eastern mole blood than in coast mole blood .

identification of hb isoforms
one β-like and two α-like globin cdnas were obtained from three separate eastern moles, while single α- and β-like globin cdnas were obtained from three coast moles examined . a mass spectrometic analysis of eastern mole hb components revealed the presence of two distinct α-globin sequences that match the two known hba cdna sequences . the analysis revealed the presence of a single β-like globin sequence that matched the eastern mole hbd  cdna sequence . these results confirm that the two hb isoforms of eastern mole have different α-chain subunits that are distinguished by three amino acid substitutions: 48leu→met, 49lys→ser, and 121met→val . the mass spectrometry analysis of coast mole hb also revealed highly significant matches to coast mole cdna sequences. however, since the analysis revealed no evidence for structurally distinct hb isoforms, the distinct bands in the isoelectric focusing gels likely reflect some form of in vivo post-translational modification. the electrophoretic mobility patterns of the two fractions  are consistent with a deamidation reaction, whereby a portion of the amide side-chain moieties of specific asn or gln residues of hb are converted to carboxyl groups  <cit> . based on the primary sequences of the coast mole globin chains , the most probable scenario is deamidation of α60asn→asp, which is adjacent to two residues  that are often associated with this non-enzymatic reaction  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses of mole β-like genes
phylogenetic surveys of the β-globin gene family have revealed that, in most mammalian species, the β-type globin chains of adult hb are encoded by one or more copies of the hbb  gene  <cit> . however, in the eulipotyphlan  species that have been examined to date  the β-type globin chains of adult hb are encoded by multiple copies of the paralogous hbd  gene  <cit> . because recent molecular phylogenies now suggest that sorex and atelerix are sister taxa and are closely related to moles  <cit> , it is still unknown whether hbd supplanted the hbb gene before or after the shrew/hedgehog common ancestor diverged from the stem lineage of talpid moles.

we used phylogenetic reconstructions of coding sequences and intron  <dig> sequences to determine whether the β-like globin genes of eastern mole and coast mole are orthologous to the hbb or hbd genes of other eutherian mammals. phylogenetic reconstructions based on coding sequence indicated that orthologous relationships may be partly obscured by a history of concerted evolution, mediated by unequal crossing-over or interparalog gene conversion   <cit> . for example, a history of gene conversion is indicated by the fact that the human hbb gene is more similar to the human hbd gene than it is to the orthologous hbb gene in rabbit or armadillo . by contrast, the phylogeny based on intron  <dig> sequence shows that the β-like globin genes of all eulipotyphlan species examined - together with the hbd genes of human, rabbit, and armadillo - form a well-supported monophyletic group with high bootstrap support . this set of relationships indicates that the adult-expressed β-like globin genes of moles are orthologous to the hbd genes of other eutherian mammals. thus, the hbd gene appears to have supplanted the hbb gene in the common ancestor of shrews, hedgehogs and moles.

discussion
the pioneering work of bunn  <cit>  demonstrated that mammalian hbs fall into two discrete categories based on their ligand-binding properties. most species have hbs with intrinsically high o <dig> affinity that is markedly reduced in the red cell by physiological concentrations of dpg , which stabilizes the tense  state of hb by electrostatic binding within a cationic pocket  between the β-chains  <cit> . conversely, the hbs of feloids, ruminants and two species of lemur exhibit low o <dig> affinities and respond only weakly to organophosphates  <cit> , which moreover occur in low concentrations in the red cells  <cit> . the β-type chains of these animals share two features without exception: the substitution of a hydrophilic residue with a hydrophobic residue at β <dig>  <cit> , and the presence of β5ala. the latter residue is thought to give the first turn of helix a more flexibility  <cit> , allowing the modified n-termini to be drawn closer to the hydrophobic cavity between the β chains and thus mimicking dpg binding  <cit> .

though δ5ala is present in eastern  moles, contrary to our expectations, all known phosphate-binding sites are conserved in the β-type δ-chains of moles . significantly, however, eastern moles possess a novel δ136gly→glu replacement that introduces two anionic residues into the positively charged central cavity of the hb tetramer. this position is essentially invariant among mammals. however, a rare hb mutant in humans, hb hope, is characterized by a comparable charge altering replacement  and, interestingly, exhibits functional properties similar to that of eastern mole hb  <cit> . it has been proposed that the altered behaviour of hb hope arises from the formation of an intra-chain salt bridge between the carboxyl  group of β136asp and the charged α-amino group  of β1val  <cit> , thus deleting a pair of dpg binding sites and stabilizing the t-state molecule via the newly established ionic linkage  <cit> . however, the electrophoretic properties of hb hope remain unchanged at ph  <dig>   <cit> , where the n-terminius is expected to be deprotonated  and the β1val-β136asp salt-bridge thus destabilized. additionally, given that this proposed interaction deletes a maximum of two  docking sites for dpg, the near complete abolishment of organophosphate binding to hb hope is difficult to explain. indeed, hb variants that lack dpg binding sites at the n-terminus , at β <dig>  and at β <dig>  only exhibit modest reductions in dpg sensitivity. these inconsistencies suggest another molecular mechanism may underlie the drastic functional changes found in hb hope and the eastern mole protein.

in accord with this suggestion, our structural model illustrates that the carboxyl side chain of δ136glu forms a stable salt bridge with the nearby ε-amino group of δ82lys . this association is consistent with the observed low electrophoretic mobility of hb hope at ph  <dig>   <cit> , as the high pka of the lysine side chain  would stabilize the strong β136asp-β82lys bond over a wide ph range. importantly, the δ136gly→glu replacement in eastern mole hb  is also expected to neutralize the strong cationic charge of the δ <dig> lysyl side chain . this substitution should reduce electrostatic repulsion between the dimer subunits  <cit> , thereby reducing the intrinsic o <dig> affinity of the r-state protein. consistent with this expectation, the intrinsic o <dig> affinity of eastern mole hb is ~ <dig> -fold lower than that of coast mole hb in the physiological ph range . finally, the strongly suppressed dpg sensitivities of human hbs with residue replacements at β <dig>  are qualitatively similar in magnitude to that of eastern mole hb . in this regard, it is notable that eastern moles also possess an unusual δ3leu→met substitution in the n-terminal region of the δ-chains . aided by the increased flexibility provided by residues δ5ala and δ130phe  <cit> , the longer side-chain of this residue  may promote an increased interaction of the β-type subunit a-helix with its hydrophobic core, and further inhibit dpg binding . finally, the eastern mole δ-globin chains possess an additional, potentially significant replacement that introduces a polar hydroxyl group  into the α1δ <dig> interface. this site is typically invariant in mammalian hbs  <cit>  and may be responsible for the larger p <dig> difference between cofactor-free hbs of eastern mole and coast mole  than the  <dig> -fold change caused by the β136gly→asp substitution of hb hope at this same temperature  <cit> .

the chloride sensitivities of both major hb components of the eastern mole  are about 30% less than those of coast mole hbs . hb hope also exhibits a markedly lowered cl- effect relative to hb a  <cit> , providing additional support for the view that this characteristic arises from the loss of two anion binding sites in the eastern mole protein . however, it is of note that the p <dig> of coast mole hb i exposed to saturating dpg in  <dig>  m cl- media was higher than values obtained when either of these anions were present alone . this observation suggests that mole hbs possess an extra chloride-binding site  that does not overlap with the dpg binding site. this inference is moreover consistent with the numerically low oxygenation enthalpies  of both mole hbs in  <dig>  m cl- media .

the  <dig>  kj mol- <dig> o <dig> difference in overall oxygenation enthalpy of eastern mole whole blood relative to coast mole blood  aligns well with the reduced exothermic contributions conferred by both the loss of cl- binding sites between δ1val and δ82lys , and by a lack of dpg binding  to eastern mole hb. interestingly, the numerical Δh values for whole blood  and purified hbs  of coast and eastern moles, respectively, are notably lower than those reported for both whole blood  and the hb fractions  of 'cold-adapted' musk-ox and reindeer. given that possession of blood with numerically low oxygenation enthalpies helps to ensure adequate o <dig> delivery to cool peripheral tissues of these arctic mammals  <cit> , and that subterranean environments are generally moderate and thermally buffered from climatic extremes, what might account for the occurrence of this characteristic in the fossorial species  but not in the  semi-aquatic star-nosed mole? by mandating that blood-o <dig> affinity decreases as temperature increases, the exothermic character of the hb oxygenation reaction also dictates that o <dig> uptake is compromised at high temperature. unlike most fossorial mammals, talpid moles are powerful forelimb diggers that possess a large muscle mass surrounding the thoracic cavity. consequently, we propose that the negligible thermal sensitivity of mole blood may minimize impairment of o <dig> loading at the lungs during exercise-induced hyperthermia while burrowing in hypoxic/hypercapnic soils. in fact, a high Δh  would further exacerbate o <dig> uptake potential since it increases the heat liberated upon oxygenation in the lungs . the precise mechanism underlying the extremely low oxygenation enthalpy phenotype of coast/eastern mole blood is not known, but may be associated with the presence of an 'additional' cl- binding site in these species .

the negligible effect of dpg on eastern mole hb , together with the finding that the erythrocytes of this species are nearly devoid of dpg , demonstrates that this organophosphate does not have a central allosteric role in altering its blood o <dig> affinity. this reduced plasticity may be expected to have potentially adverse consequences since mammals with dpg-insensitive hbs are unable to modify their hb-o <dig> binding attributes in response to chronic changes in oxygen availability, and hence "are likely to be more restricted physiologically" than those whose oxygen affinity can be altered by increasing/decreasing red cell dpg concentrations  <cit> . indeed, it has long been appreciated that cats, cows and sheep - which were subsequently discovered to possess low affinity, dpg-insensitive hbs  <cit>  - do not adjust well to high altitudes   <cit> . why then have eastern moles, following an extensive period of fossorial evolution , recently forsaken the potential for adaptive modulation of their o2-binding affinity by phosphates  and adopted a lower whole blood o <dig> affinity phenotype?

we hypothesize that the loss of dpg binding sharply increases the carrying capacity of eastern mole hb for the metabolic end product co <dig>  thus providing a strong selective advantage for this subterranean inhabitant. unlike carbon monoxide, co <dig> does not bind to the heme iron, but instead can interact with the uncharged α-amino termini of the four globin chains to form carbamino co2-  <cit> . in the absence of dpg , 70-80% of all carbamate formation under physiological conditions occurs on the "high affinity" β-type subunits  <cit> . in human hb a, the carbamated β-chain n-termini are able to form intra-chain ionic contacts with β82lys  <cit> , thus stabilizing the deoxy state molecule . conversely, the δ136gly→glu replacement in eastern mole hb  should disallow this δ1val-δ82lys interaction. indeed, in the absence of dpg, the co <dig> effect  of the hb hope variant is 70% lower at a pco <dig> of  <dig> mm hg  <cit>  than in human hb a, and nearly 90% lower at a pco <dig> of  <dig> mm hg  <cit> .

within the erythrocytes of systemic capillaries, co <dig> is largely hydrated to hco3- and h+ by carbonic anhydrase. hco3- is subsequently exchanged with cl- via the band  <dig> protein anion-exchanger, and transported in the plasma  <cit> . however, band  <dig> protein anion-exchange appears to be the rate-limiting step in the uptake and offloading of co <dig>  potentially leading to exchange disequilibra in arteries and veins during severe exercise  <cit> . in this respect, the δ136gly→glu replacement in the eastern mole hb may be significant as it deletes binding sites for anions  between δ1val and δ82lys, thus largely freeing the 'high co <dig> affinity' δ-chain n-termini from competitive binding constraints. accordingly, this should result in enhanced binding of co <dig> to eastern mole hb  while reducing reliance on the anion-exchanger channel, thus increasing the maximal co <dig> carrying capacity of eastern mole blood. in this regard, it should be noted that deoxygenation-linked carbamate formation also liberates a proton from the n-terminal α-amino group, which might be expected to increase the bohr effect of eastern mole hb . however, the hb of this species possesses an additional external histidyl residue  relative to other moles that should mitigate this effect. finally, by stabilizing the tense  conformation of eastern mole hb, the δ136gly→glu replacement also confers a marked reduction in their whole-blood o <dig> affinity  compared to coast  and european moles  <cit> . this reduced blood affinity would facilitate the offloading of o <dig> at a relatively high po <dig>  leading to a large o <dig> gradient between the plasma and tissues during burst tunnelling activities. this shift may negatively impact the o <dig> saturation of eastern mole blood during periods of hypoxia, but is presumably mitigated by elevated blood hematocrit  and hb concentrations  compared to coast , star-nosed , townsend's  and european moles . eastern moles thus present a novel category of hbs that appear to be specifically engineered for burst activities in gas-exchange impeded burrows.

CONCLUSIONS
the capacity of certain mammals to withstand low-oxygen environments is thought to largely reside in the enhanced binding affinity of their blood hb for oxygen. here we document that following an extensive period of subterranean evolution, the lineage leading to present day eastern moles adopted a low oxygen affinity, dpg-insensitive blood phenotype - providing the first demonstration of this phenomenon in any mammal chronically exposed to hypoxia . the primary molecular mechanism involves an amino acid substitution  that forms a salt bridge with δ82lys of the same chain, thus deleting key binding sites for allosteric effectors  between δ1val-δ82lys and markedly reducing competition for co <dig> binding  at the n-terminus. accordingly, we suggest this unique hb phenotype enhances co <dig> carrying capacity during burst activity  in gas-exchange impeded burrows.
