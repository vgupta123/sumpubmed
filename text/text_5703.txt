BACKGROUND
the protease enzyme coded for by the pol gene of the human immunodeficiency virus hiv- <dig> plays a critical role in the reproduction of the virus by cleaving the gag precursor protein in a sequence-specific manner into its functional form, and as such, is a key target of several families of commonly used drugs used to control hiv infection  <cit> . unfortunately, the virus has been able to evolve resistance to many of these drugs, in part due to the high mutation rates in the hiv genome  <cit> . the patterns of mutations in protease are complex, involving multiple key primary mutations that inhibit the action of drugs and a host of accessory mutations that can modulate the enzyme's stability or activity or otherwise enhance the fitness of the virus. it is now understood that these mutations do not occur independently of each other, but instead are correlated, resulting in complex patterns of co-evolving mutations  <cit> .

previous studies have mostly focused on correlations between mutations in the hiv protease gene at the pair level  <cit> . however, recognition that the observed mutations may also be involved in higher-order interactions has led to a few studies in which correlated pairs of mutations are grouped using tools such as multidimensional scaling  <cit> , bayesian networks  <cit> , networks defined by patterns of conditional selection pressure  <cit> , and clustering  <cit> . the underlying assumption is that understanding higher-order interactions is important for a complete understanding of the evolution of resistance in hiv protease.

in this paper, we investigate correlations among hiv protease mutations at and beyond the pair level, and the impact of drug treatment on the nature of those correlations. we only consider the presence or absence of a non-synonymous mutation relative to a defined wild-type sequence, and not the precise base or amino acid substitution which has occurred. we develop a hierarchy of probabilistic log-linear models  <cit>  that can in principle describe residue interactions of arbitrary order, and use those to analyze hiv protease sequence data obtained from patient cohorts with varying protease inhibitor  treatment histories.

we use "connected information"  <cit>  to quantify inter-residue interactions at the triplet and higher level. unlike the bayesian network approach  <cit> , the information-theoretic methodology allows us to distinguish intrinsic three-body effects from the cases in which correlations between three random variables can be attributed mostly to pairwise interactions. the connected information viewpoint of higher order correlation has not been previously used in the analysis of mutational patterns in hiv protease, although it has been employed in a much more limited analysis of the v <dig> loop of the hiv envelope protein  <cit> , and log-linear models have been used to study protein-protein interactions  <cit> . we find that pairwise interactions are necessary to achieve even qualitative agreement with the mutational data, while higher order interactions play an important role in predicting how frequently sequences with several mutations appear in the database. simultaneous appearance of multiple mutations may play an important role in the phenomenon of multiple- or cross-resistance of the viral protease.

RESULTS
increased mutation frequencies under drug exposure
as has been previously observed  <cit> , we find that the overall number of mutations seen in hiv protease increases significantly with the number of pis that the patient has been exposed to. this is seen in figure  <dig>  where we show the distribution of the number of mutations at drug-associated positions for sequences isolated from the drug-naive cohort , from a pi monotherapy cohort , and from a cohort treated with  <dig> or more pis , as estimated from the database described in the methods. for some residue positions, the increase in the mutation frequency between the pi <dig> and pi2+ cohorts is nearly eightfold, while other positions show no discernible change . this observed increase in mutation frequencies at drug-associated sites is largely responsible for the shift in the distribution shown in figure  <dig> 

it is of interest to ask which amino acid positions exhibit elevated mutation frequencies under drug treatment. mutations at many of these positions are associated with decreased hiv- <dig> inhibitor susceptibility, and it is useful to classify mutations as belonging to "primary" vs "accessory" resistance classes. the terms "secondary" and "compensatory" have also been used as synonyms for "accessory". the specific criteria for such a classification are ad hoc in nature, but have generally been defined as follows.

primary mutations are usually selected first in the presence of the drug and confer resistance, even when present as single point mutations  <cit> . they can be structurally important, e.g. situated near the enzymatic active site, in which case their effect on inhibitor binding can be rationalized due to their physical proximity to the inhibitor  <cit> . in the case of protease, however, there are exceptions, as some mutations  are situated far from the active site or have no direct contacts with the substrate, yet still reduce drug susceptibility  <cit> . the mechanism of action of these mutations is not clearly understood  <cit> .

accessory mutations confer resistance only when present with additional primary or accessory drug-resistance mutations and have little or no effect on inhibitor susceptibility on their own. some of these mutations occur in the absence of drug treatment, but their frequency of occurrence is observed to increase in treated patients. accessory mutations may "rescue" possible losses of activity or stability in the enzyme that may have been caused by a destabilizing primary resistance mutation, and therefore may have a compensatory function in restoring viral fitness  <cit> .

we make use of a primary and accessory classification scheme based on the work of shafer et al.  <cit> . we define  <dig> primary drug resistance positions  and  <dig> accessory drug resistance positions . the remaining positions are polymorphic mutations not associated with drug resistance or are conserved sites  <cit> .

as seen in figure  <dig>  the positions which exhibit the most elevated mutation frequencies in pi2+ relative to pi <dig> sequences are for the most part primary and accessory drug resistance positions. it is interesting to note that sequences bearing mutations at any one of the  <dig> residues with the most elevated mutation frequencies  are resistant to most of the current pis, including amprenavir , indinavir , nelfinavir , ritonavir , saquinavir , atazanavir , and lopinavir . for instance, according to the stanford hiv database  <cit> , the common mutations at these residues  are associated with six or all seven of the drugs mentioned above. on the other hand, primary drug resistance positions that show the least amount of change in their mutation frequency  are generally inhibitor-specific. for example, d30n is associated only with nfv treatment, l23i and l76v are specific to two drugs each , while n88d is specific to idv, sqv and nfv treatment. thus, positions that provide drug resistance to multiple inhibitors are more frequently mutated in the pi2+ cohort than positions that are specific to a small number of protease inhibitors. upon examination of  <dig> ligand-bound crystal structures of hiv- <dig> protease, no heavy atom of residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  or  <dig> is ever within  <dig>  Å of any ligand bound at the cleft . the atoms of residue  <dig>  however, do contact ligands in 54% of the crystal structures examined.

exhaustive analysis of residue pairs
we begin by investigating pair correlations and their association with the structure of hiv protease. several groups have studied pair correlations as a means of identifying functionally dependent residues in the hiv protease and other systems  <cit> . for each of the  =  <dig>   <dig> pairs of positions, a  <dig> ×  <dig> contingency table was constructed for both the drug-naive sequences and the sequences treated by two or more drugs. the binomial or "product moment"  <cit>  correlation coefficient

   

was calculated for both datasets, where for amino acid position a we denote the wild-type state as a <dig> and the mutated state as am. of the  <dig>   <dig> ϕ values,  <dig> from the drug-naive and  <dig> from the treated set were considered to be statistically significant with substantial correlations . these correlations match qualitatively with a prior study which used the same database but had fewer sequences: the ϕ values of the top  <dig> positively correlated pairs for the pi2+ cohort and those of wu, et al.  <cit>  have a spearman rank order correlation coefficient of  <dig>  . furthermore, we observe larger ϕ values for pairs of drug-associated positions compared to non-drug associated pairs , which is consistent with previous observations  <cit> .

previous studies of pair correlations in protein families have indicated that coevolving pairs of residues tend to lie closer to each other in structure than random residue pairs  <cit> . in the case of the hiv protease, the distribution of ϕ values for drug-associated positions with distance shows a characteristic triangular shape, particularly for the pi2+ cohort   <cit> . in particular, distances associated with the most correlated residue pairs  are all within a few Ångstroms of each other. the triangular shape in figure 3b is not surprising, given that most of the drug-associated positions are on the substrate cleft and thus tend to be relatively close to each other in space. as a result,  <dig> pairs  are within  <dig> Å of each other. we also see no tendency for exposed residues to preferentially coevolve, in contrast to previous studies on mutation covariation in other protein families  <cit> .

of the  <dig> statistically significant negatively correlated pairs in the pi2+ cohort,  <dig> pairs involve either residues  <dig> or  <dig>  residue  <dig> is negatively correlated with positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> , while position  <dig> is negatively correlated with positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  it is interesting to note that position  <dig>  which has a high mutation rate in both the pi <dig> and pi2+ cohorts, is negatively correlated with positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  of which only position  <dig> is associated with drug resistance  <cit> . in fact, of the  <dig> unique positions involved in the  <dig> negatively correlated pairs, most, but not all, are positions of drug resistance. it is possible that the  <dig> non-drug associated positions,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> play a role in the stability or function of the protein, even if they do not interfere with inhibitors  <cit> . residue  <dig>  in particular is negatively correlated with three residues,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all of which play either primary or accessory roles in drug resistance.

drug treatment has a significant impact on the pair correlations, as can be seen in figure  <dig>  of the  =  <dig>   <dig> pairs of positions, only  <dig> have statistically significant  ϕ values and are common to both the pi <dig> and pi2+ cohorts, and of these, most of the positively correlated pairs in the pi <dig> cohort become more strongly correlated in the pi2+ cohort. however, some pairs of residues which are weakly positively correlated in the pi <dig> cohort become negatively correlated in the pi2+ cohort. there are  <dig> such pairs, almost all of which have at least one primary drug resistance position, and  <dig> of them involve either residue  <dig> or  <dig>  it is interesting to note that in pi <dig> cohort sequences, residue  <dig> is positively correlated with positions  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  but becomes strongly negatively correlated in the pi2+ cohort. the anticorrelation of residue  <dig> with the other primary positions after drug treatment has been previously observed experimentally  <cit>  and in a prior statistical study  <cit> , but it is not clear why this anticorrelation exists only in the presence of drugs.

additionally, the types of residues involved in pair correlations changes upon treatment, with accessory positions becoming more prominent: 10% of the correlated pairs in the pi <dig> cohort consist of a primary and an accessory position, and that this combination increases to 31% in the pi2+ cohort. furthermore, 45% of the pairs in the pi <dig> cohort involve at least one accessory position, which increases to 61% in the pi2+ cohort. as expected, pairs of non-resistance-associated positions decrease from 52% to 35%. it is interesting to note that the same trend is not observed for primary positions: 57% of pairs in the pi <dig> cohort contain at least one primary position, and this is essentially unchanged in the pi2+ cohort . therefore, drug treatment causes correlated pairs involving primary and non-resistance associated positions to be replaced by pairs involving primary and accessory positions.

exhaustive analysis of residue triples
to study interactions among mutations beyond the pair level, we quantify the amount of information in the observed distribution that cannot be explained by pair correlation. this is done using the three-body "connected information"  <cit> , which is defined as the difference in shannon entropy s = -∑ipi log pi between the distributions p and , where the latter is the maximum entropy distribution subject to the constraints that all of its univariate and bivariate marginals are the same as that of p:

   

similarly, we define the two-body connected information to be

   

the total information arising from correlation at any level is given by the "multi-information" or the kullback-leibler divergence between the observed distribution and the prediction based on an independent model:

   

the maximum entropy distribution  can be thought of as being "in between" the independent model and the observed distribution, since it is more constrained than the independent model but does not have the full correlation structure of the observed data . since , we can interpret the two- and three-body connected information as the part of the correlation that can be explained by pair interactions alone, and that which arises from three-body interactions, respectively  <cit> .

we examined the degree of connected information in both the pi <dig> and pi2+ cohort sequences. the connected information  was calculated for all  =  <dig>   <dig> residue triples in the hiv protease as described in the methods section below. in the pi <dig> cohort sequences, only  <dig> residue triples have statistically significant three-body interaction at the p =  <dig>  level, while the pi2+ cohort sequences have  <dig>  significant triples. furthermore, the significant triples from the pi2+ cohort are enriched in drug resistance associated positions: 32% of them consist of only drug associated positions, compared to 12% of the full set of  <dig> . in contrast, the significant triples from the pi <dig> cohort show no such enrichment: only 9% consist solely of drug resistance associated positions.

the  <dig> triples with the largest  values from the pi2+ cohort sequences are shown in table  <dig>  along with the corresponding values of imulti. residues from the largest  triple  are also displayed on the structure of the hiv protease . as can be seen in table  <dig>  the total contribution of three-body interactions to the information content of the observed data is at most 10%. although this is a relatively small effect, there is a clear association with drug therapy, with the largest  values increasing substantially with the number of pis the patient was exposed to . there is relatively little overlap between the largest  <dig>  triples in the pi <dig> and pi2+ cohorts, with only  <dig> triples in common. the impact of these higher-order interactions is particularly manifest in the probability of the occurrence of three simultaneous mutations in a given residue triple , which is significantly increased compared to what would be predicted based on a pair model for sequences from the pi2+ cohort .

while all of the triples in table  <dig> have three-body interactions that are highly statistically significant, it is also important to obtain a practical feeling for the magnitude of these interactions. let us consider the 46-54- <dig> triple. in figure  <dig> we show the correlation between the predicted and observed probabilities for each of the  <dig> binary states for the independent model  and the two-body fit  for this triple in the pi2+ cohort. it is clear that the independent model fits the data poorly: the probability that all three residues are mutated is underestimated by an order of magnitude, and some of the others are over- or underestimated by factors of  <dig> or  <dig>  although the two-body fit does a better job of reproducing the observed probabilities, it still leads to noticeable deviations from the straight line for the 46-54- <dig> triple.

another way in which the magnitude of the effect of the three-body interactions can be visualized is by considering conditional probabilities for the 46-54-90: p =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , p =  <dig> , and p =  <dig> . all of these probabilities differ significantly from the independent estimate of p =  <dig> . we also see clear evidence of "triplet correlation" in the data, in the sense that the probability of a mutation depends very strongly on the state of both of the other residues, e.g. residue  <dig> is much less likely to be mutated if both  <dig> and  <dig> are wild-type than if only one of them is wild-type.

much of this probabilistic dependency, however, can be accounted for by pair interactions. the corresponding probabilities for the best-fit two-body model are  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> ,  =  <dig> , and  =  <dig> . even though this model contains no three-body interactions, a qualitative "triplet correlation" of the type seen above remains  ≈  > ), indicating that non-trivial three-way probabilistic dependencies can arise purely from pair correlations  <cit> . overall, three-body interactions do quantitatively modulate the probabilities, but only to a small degree, since  is an order of magnitude smaller than imulti even for the triples in table  <dig>  in other words, the contribution of three-body interactions to any of the triplet distributions that describe the mutational patterns of protease taken three at a time is roughly 10% or less of the effect induced by the pairwise interactions acting on these positions. nonetheless, there can be substantial effects on a "micro level", such as the more than twofold difference in p seen here.

increased higher-order interactions in larger residue groups
the small but consistent systematic deviations seen in figure 8b raises the possibility that these interactions could combine synergystically to produce more substantial effects over larger clusters of residues. ideally, this would be studied by fitting log-linear models to increasingly larger clusters using the data from the pi2+ cohort. however, the size of cohort limits our ability to do this to clusters of no more than ≈  <dig> residues. we begin by examining the 10-residue group 20-32-46-48-53-54-58-74-82- <dig>  which was chosen to have the largest higher-order interactions from among a limited set of residues defined by the three key primary drug resistance positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  and the known accessory positions associated with them. for this 10-residue group in the pi2+ cohort, we observe strong pair interactions which bring observed and predicted probabilities into qualitative, order-of-magnitude agreement, weaker three-body interactions which further improve the agreement, and very weak four-body and higher interactions which have quantitative impact on a small number of state probabilities . this can be quantified in terms of connected information: from the entropies of the of the observed, three-body model, pair model, and independent distributions , we find that  = s - s =  <dig> ,  = s - s =  <dig> , and the sum of the remaining connected information measures of fourth order and higher is s - s =  <dig>  . when compared to imulti = s - s =  <dig> , we see that three-body and higher-order interactions make up 28% of the total correlation information. this is substantial increase over the  10% contribution from higher-order interactions to the observed triplet distributions. by contrast, the same 10-residue group for the pi <dig> cohort displays a substantially smaller overall degree of correlation, as seen by the small imulti in figure  <dig> 

we also studied the distribution of the total number of mutations in the same 10-residue group . appropriate subsets of the state probabilities determined above were summed to obtain the distribution of the total number of mutated residues for the independent, two-body, and three-body models, and the results are shown in figure 11a. the distribution for the independent model is very different from the observed distribution: the probability of having no mutations is considerably underestimated, and the upper tail is much too thin. adding pair terms greatly improves the "no mutation" probability and considerably extends the length of the tail. the tail length is further modulated by the addition of the three-body interactions, bringing the distribution very close to the observed probabilities.

it should be noted that since the univariate marginals are preserved by all of the models, the mean total number of mutations is the same for all  <dig> curves in figure 11a. therefore, under- or overestimation of the total number of mutations in one part of the distribution must be compensated by over- or under-estimation  in another, implying that the curves must cross one other. to quantify this effect, we can compare the predicted probabilities for seeing  <dig> or more mutations under each model and comparing to the observed probability. those probabilities are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for the independent, pair-term model, and pair+three-body model, respectively, compared to the observed probability of  <dig> . the deviations of the first two from the observed are highly statistically significant, while the latter has a p-value of ≈  <dig> . the qualitative distribution is well accounted for by the pair interaction model, with the three-body and higher interactions modulating the details of the shape of the distribution, such as the increase in frequency of 3– <dig> and 13– <dig> mutations, at the expense of a decrease in the frequency of 6– <dig> mutations.

to see if the synergistic effects seen for the 10-residue group become even stronger for  <dig> residues, we repeated this analysis for the 15-residue group 10-20-33-36-46-54-55-63-71-73-74-82-84-90– <dig> , which was chosen by selecting the residues with the largest change in mutation frequencies upon pi treatment. for the pi2+ cohort, we find that  = s - s =  <dig> , the sum of the remaining connected information measures of third order and higher is s - s =  <dig>  and imulti = s - s =  <dig> . the contribution of three-body and higher-order interactions now make up 41% of the total correlation information. however, this result may somewhat overestimate the true amount of higher-order correlation. a fit with a three-body model  gives an estimate of  of  <dig> , and the ratio  represents a lower bound on the contribution from correlations beyond the pair level. a more complete account of the many issues involved in estimating the amount of higher order correlation and its precision and accuracy for finite data sets will be the subject of a future communication. the comparison of the predicted and observed distributions of total number of mutations bears out this result , showing more pronounced differences between the observed  and pair-model  distributions. in addition to the overestimation of the upper tail similar to that seen for the 10-residue group, we now also see that the pair model cannot reproduce the bimodal shape seen in the observed data. again, the same 15-residue group for the pi <dig> cohort shows considerably weaker overall correlation .

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
treating hiv protease with drugs results in the appearance of complex mutational patterns: observed mutations are not limited to the active site and often occur in groups that involve two or more residues. furthermore, some mutations occur even in the absence of drugs, presumably following neutral rather than adaptive evolution. to study correlations between different residue positions in hiv protease, we have developed a hierarchy of models that allows us to include inter-residue correlations of arbitrary order within a consistent framework. using only hiv protease sequences as input, we find that pair interactions become common and quite strong after pi treatment. in fact, it is often impossible to achieve even qualitative agreement with the data without including the two-body terms . this finding calls into question a common assumption employed in current probabilistic approaches to phylogeny  <cit>  that most residues evolve independently.

we have developed an information-theoretic method to study interactions between mutations beyond the pairwise level. our approach is based on the notion of the connected information    <cit> . while there are a variety of quantitatively different measures of pair correlation  <cit>  that may differ in their sensitivity in various regimes, they all measure essentially the same qualitative feature of the observed data. on the other hand, no single summary statistic can capture all of the various characteristics of higher-order behavior, leading to multiple descriptions that provide complimentary information. connected information is one intuitive statistic that provides insight into the degree of structure in the data beyond the pair correlation level.

connected information provides information which is complementary to bayesian network analyses based on factorizations of the joint probability. it can readily verified that  =  <dig> if at least one of the random variables is independent of the other two, or if the joint distribution involves conditional independence  = ppp). however, a joint distribution with triplet-level probabilistic dependencies  = ppp, or if p cannot be factorized into any simpler form) could still be consistent with no three-body connected information if the observed triplet distribution is the maximum entropy distribution relative to its marginals. thus, even if a bayesian network-style analysis shows that a given triple cannot be factorized into any simpler form, that "triplet correlation" could still be consistent with a very small or zero , indicating that the observed behavior is dominated by two-body interactions. in fact, it has been shown that very complex correlation patterns among random variables can arise from large numbers of weak pairwise interactions  <cit> .

other information-theoretic measures of "higher-order correlation" have also been proposed, including higher-order mutual information, which measures "frustration" or the degree of synergy vs redundancy among several random variables  <cit> . while this measure has been used in the analysis of hiv envelope protein sequence data  <cit> , its interpretation is considerably less intuitive. similarly, ad hoc methods for finding putative clusters of mutually correlated residues  <cit>  cannot reliably uncover sets that have intrinsic higher order interactions, as defined by large  .

plotting ϕ values for pairs of residues as a function of the distance between them  reveals that while some large pair correlations arise from direct contacts between residues , there are also strong correlations  between amino acids separated by  <dig> Å or more, making physical coupling between them very unlikely. to provide an example of the former, we consider mutations involving residues  <dig> and  <dig>  the closest distance between heavy atoms of residues  <dig> and  <dig> is just  <dig>  Å, making likely some sort of physical interaction between them. mutations at residue  <dig> are strongly and uniquely associated with resistance to the protease inhibitor nelfinavir, and there exists a strong correlation between mutations at positions  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit>  which may be due in part to a compensation of the loss of a surface negative charge from the d30n mutation being restored by n88d  <cit> .

it is possible that chains of intermediate interactions result in long-range coupling between two coevolving yet physically distant residues  <cit> . however, because non-zero values of λij indicate a presence of direct interactions between residues i and j in our model  <cit> , we can decompose such "energetically connected pathways" into contributions from separate pairs. in contrast to a previous study  <cit> , we find that non-zero values of λij are only weakly correlated with distance . this lack of correlation is not entirely surprising, since even direct interactions between a pair of residues need not have a purely physical origin. indeed, if protein fitness is a non-linear function of its stability or enzymatic activity  <cit> , two mutations can be correlated because they compensate each other by making independent and opposite contributions to the overall fitness, even if there is no direct or indirect physical interaction between them  <cit> . by the same argument, the three-body terms also result from a mixture of physical and epistatic  origins.

we have shown that three-body and higher-order correlations have the largest effect on the probabilities of the simultaneous occurrence of multiple mutations in the hiv protease . since both this and previous studies have found that the total number of mutated positions is correlated with treatment by multiple protease inhibitors   <cit> , the presence of higher-order interactions may influence how protease reacts to multiple drugs, and could have an important impact on the evolution of cross-resistance, for example, by providing the virus with an "escape hatch" of large numbers of mutations. higher-order interactions could also impact the time evolution of mutations by allowing the virus to pass through otherwise unlikely mutational states. we have seen that the impact of higher-order interactions in  <dig> to  <dig> residue clusters is at least a factor of two larger than the largest  values for residue triples . one of the outstanding questions raised by this work is whether the impact of higher-order interactions for hiv evolving under the pressure of multiple drugs continues to become stronger for larger residue groups . unfortunately, there is not enough sequence data to perform such an analysis. short of obtaining additional data, it may also be possible to explore this question by constructing synthetic data sets using λi and λij values consistent with an observed  distribution at the level of residue triples .

the sequence-based approach presented here is not limited to the hiv protease and its response to drug treatment, and should be equally useful in studies of the evolution of drug resistance in other systems. moreover, it will be of interest to extend our techniques to other examples of short-term neutral and adaptive evolution, including controlled evolution in the lab accompanied by protein sequencing at different timepoints. recent work has suggested that evolutionary pathways of proteins are relatively restricted and may be predictable in general  <cit> , and specific methods for predicting the mutational dynamics of hiv protease have been proposed, based on bayesian network models  <cit>  or pairwise conditional selection pressure  <cit> . a better understanding of the nature of the probabilistic dependencies underlying the network models should lead to improved prediction strategies. however, our model cannot distinguish between physical and epistatic origins of the observed co-evolution. to do this, we need a different approach which would explicitly introduce protein fitness as a function of residue energies . these energies would be fit against the sequence data, resulting in a prediction that decomposes observed inter-residue correlations into the physical and epistatic parts. this approach is currently being pursued in our laboratories.
