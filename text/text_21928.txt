BACKGROUND
health risks from environmental pollution in china have become increasingly important to public concern, especially in terms of food safety. many toxicological methods have been invented to test for the presence of gene mutations and chromosome aberrations due to environmental pollutants, such as the salmonella reverse mutation assay for mutagenic activities and the comet assay for chromosome damage  <cit> . some research has shown that epigenetic negative effect of environmental pollutants in food materials cannot be overlooked. the epigenetic mechanism has become one of the focusing fields for the etiology of many disorders, including the adverse effect of many environmental pollutants, such as heavy metals, during the last decade. the primary function of dna methylation for regulatory elements is to down-modulate gene expression. epigenetic changes, including global dna hypomethylation and hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes, are frequently observed in cancer cells. dna methylation is susceptible to change and an excellent candidate for explaining how certain environmental factors may increase the risk of cancer  <cit> .

cadmium increases dna methylation and the expression of dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a mrna in the livers and kidneys of hens, implying that dna methylation may be involved in the carcinogenic action of cadmium  <cit> . environmental cadmium exposure was associated with dna hypomethylation in peripheral blood in argentinean women  <cit> . the genetic reactivation of long interspersed nuclear element- <dig> by benzopyrene involves reduced dna methylation of cpg islands  <cit> . many pollutants appear to have the potential to change the dna methylation status of key genetic elements, which may be involved in the disorder progression from environmental pollutants in many types of food material.

according to the  <dig> china marine environmental quality communique  <cit> , the costal line water in bohai bay abutting the tianjin metropolitan area has been ranked worst for pollution for many years. even the living marine mollusks in the coastal sea area abutting the pollution sources are marked by serious heavy metal contamination  <cit> . the total toxic demethylation potential of aquatic samples should be examined to evaluate their safety for local residents. thus far, few studies have reported on assessment methods of dna methylation alternation for food material. one study reports on the establishment of a detection system for demethylating agents using an endogenous promoter cpg island  <cit> , but the hct  <dig> cell line is a poor candidate tool due to its relative absence of the cytochromes p <dig> enzymes and corresponding activation of pollutants. another two-component reporter gene system has been described based on the visualization and quantization of dynamic changes in targeted dna methylation in bone marrow-derived stem cells or cancer cell lines  <cit> .

the assessment of dna methylation status is proposed for safety assessment, and the evaluation of the overall methylation status is desirable . in the present study, which aims to develop a demethylation toxicity assessment of aquatic samples that can quickly identify potential health risks through epigenetic mechanisms, we report a novel method for the total demethylation potential quantification  with the egfp reporter gene and the artificially methylated promoter in hep g <dig> cell lines .fig.  <dig> tdq schematic of total demethylation potential quantification method for aquatic samples. a aquatic samples containing pollutants of strong demethylation potential as 5-aza-cdr. b control or aquatic samples containing pollutants of weak demethylation potential. pegfp-c <dig>  pegfp-c <dig> plasmid vector. promoter, the cmv promoter in ppegfp-c <dig> vector. small stick with round point end in the promoter area represents the methyl 



RESULTS
validity of tdq test for demethylation potential
the 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine  was selected as a representative positive demethylation agent to validate the principle of the tdq method  on three levels: dose–response relationship exploration between the concentration of 5-aza-cdr and the methylation level of cmv promoters, mrna expression level of egfp gene, and the intensity of cellular fluorescence intensity . the hep g <dig> cells with successful transfection of pegfp-c <dig> plasmids containing methylated promoters grew well after the cell incubation conditions were optimized.table  <dig> the effect of 5-aza-cdr on the egfp reporter gene in cells with the tdq experiment

methylation level of cmv promoter and the treatment of 5-aza-cdr
the bisulfite treatment of dna converts all unmethylated cytosines to uracils, whereas methylated cytosine is unchanged under the reaction condition; thus, methylation status can be determined from different sequences  <cit> . the decreasing methylation levels of the cmv promoter were observed from cells treated with increasing 5-aza-cdr doses with bsp results. the representative bsp results are shown in fig.  <dig>  there is a significant dose-effect relationship expressed as y = − <dig> ln +  <dig>   between the 5-aza-cdr treatment and the methylation level of the cmv promoter from corresponding cells in the tdq test , which indicates that cmv promoter methylation is a valid candidate test target for potential demethylation agents.fig.  <dig> the representative sequence maps for bsp methylation quantification of the cmv promoter in cells. this map is for the 290–330 bp of the pcr t clones for sequencing. the upper map  for the control group:  <dig> mcgs  did not change after bisulfite treatment and sequencing. the lower map  for 5-aza-cdr group:  <dig> mcgs changed to tgs  due to the methyl lost and  <dig> mcgs did not change  after bisulfite treatment and sequencing

expression level of the egfp gene and the treatment of 5-aza-cdr
to explore the response of the egfp gene expression to the treatment of 5-aza-cdr gradients in the tdq experiment, the relative mrna volume of the egfp gene within the c <dig> plasmid was evaluated based on a reference gapdh gene. increasing expression levels of the target gene from different cell wells were found with increasing concentrations of 5-aza-cdr . a significant dose-effect relationship between the 5-aza-cdr treatment and the relative folds of egfp mrna was confirmed with an equation of y =  <dig> exp  , which indicated that the expression of egfp mrna within the c <dig> plasmid in the hep g <dig> cell lines is sensitive to the treatment of 5-aza-cdr.

fluorescence intensity of egfp and treatment of 5-aza-cdr
to explore the response of cells’ egfp fluorescence intensity to the treatment of 5-aza-cdr gradients in the tdq experiment, the spontaneous fluorescence intensity of cells with increasing concentrations of 5-aza-cdr  was evaluated directly via microscopy imaging, and later by using flow cytometry measurement to find the percentage of positive fluorescent cells. the cells treated with higher concentration of 5-aza-cdr have significantly brighter images than those treated with correspondingly lower concentrations . a significant dose-effect relationship between the 5-aza-cdr treatment and percentage of positive fluorescent cells was confirmed and expressed by y =  <dig> ln +  <dig>   , which indicated that the spontaneous fluorescence of the egfp protein from the gene located in the pegfp-c <dig> plasmid in the hep g <dig> cell lines was sensitive to the treatment of 5-aza-cdr and possibly to other agents with demethylation potential.fig.  <dig> the representative images and flow cytometry results of different cells treated with 5-aza-cdr gradients. the upper series  are for fluorescence images  and the lower series  are for flow cytometry measurement from the control group and the 5-aza-cdr treatment groups with increasing doses 



detection limit of the tdq test for 5-aza-cdr experiment
to explore the detection limit of the tdq assay, five samples with relatively lower concentrations of 5-aza-cdr  were prepared for tdq test . results showed that the detectable noise signals varied from  <dig>  μm to  <dig>  μm, and meaningful fluorescence intensity of cells was observed with a concentration higher than  <dig>  μm 5-aza-cdr. no significant difference in fluorescence intensity was found between the cell groups treated with 5-aza-cdr  and the control cell group, while a significant difference in fluorescence intensity was observed between the cell groups treated with 5-aza-cdr  and the other cell groups . therefore, we recognized that the detection limit of tdq is approximately  <dig>  μm 5-aza-cdr.

accuracy and precision of the tdq test for 5-aza-cdr experiment
to detect the accuracy and precision of the tdq assay, five samples with moderate concentrations of 5-aza-cdr  were applied simultaneously to perform the demethylation quantification five times . results showed that the deviation results from the repetitive analysis of the four samples  varied from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the recovery rate for tdq test varied from  <dig>  % to  <dig>  %. the standard line applied here is y = exp  .table  <dig> repeated tdq experiment with cells treated with different doses of 5-aza-cdr

fig.  <dig> four samples with different concentrations of 5-aza-cdr were quantified with tdq five times. the highest recovery rate  and deviation  were observed for sample with a concentration of  <dig>  μm, while the lowest recovery rate  and deviation  were observed for sample with a concentration of  <dig>  μm. the blue bars represent the actual concentration for samples and the gradient bars represent the concentration values calculated from tdq test



optimal check time for tdq test
the optimal check time for tdq test is the suitable time for the user to collect cells for quantification of fluorescence intensity with flow cytometry. the fluorescence intensity of the cells may change at different time of the tdq timeline. to explore the optimal check time, we took a series of microscope images every 6 h when the 5-aza-cdr samples were pipetted into the cell culture medium. images with meaningful fluorescence were found beginning at hour  <dig>  and ascended to the peak plat period with the brightest fluorescence between hour  <dig> and hour  <dig>  additional tdq test of 5-aza-cdr treatment with different dosages  was conducted . therefore, hour  <dig> was selected as the optimal check time for the entire tdq test duration.

quantification of demethylation potential by tdq in aquatic samples
to explore the applicability of tdq method for the quantification of the demethylation of actual aquatic samples,  <dig> aquatic samples from china’s bohai bay were collected to prepare the inorganic extracts for further experimentation. positive demethylation potentials ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig>  μm 5-aza-cdr toxicity equivalents can be observed in eight samples. a sample  extract from beitangkou showed the highest demethylation toxic equivalency  at  <dig>  μm 5-aza toxicity equivalent . cd and as were found at  <dig>  mg/kg and  <dig>  mg/kg in this sample extract with the later icp-mass analysis; both concentrations are higher than the maximum allowable levels for cd and as in aquatic food materials in china. all of the samples with observable demethylation potential included the silurus asotus linnaeus, sinonovacula constricta, bullacta exarata, venerupis variegata, scapharca subcrenata, and rapana venosa.table  <dig> the demethylation potential and the pollutants of inorganic extracts of aquatic samples from bohai bay

discussion
this study describes a method for the quantification of the total dna demethylation potential of aquatic food samples within one week based on artificial methylation and the useful reporter gene. currently, the bohai bay area is ranked as one of the most heavily polluted coastal areas in china  <cit> . it is therefore reasonable to explore the novel demethylation potential of the aquatic materials in this area for food safety and additional dietary health risk assessment.

one precondition of this study is the hypothesis that demethylation potential is possibly an innate part of the comprehensive negative effect of environmental pollution, with the counterpart of mutation and chromosome aberration  <cit> . dozens of chemical pollutants revealed obvious effects on the steady methylation balance of genomic dna. dna methylation changes in whole blood are associated with exposure to environmental contaminants such as cadmium, mercury, lead, and bisphenol a  <cit> , implying that the demethylation potential of the aquatic samples from heavily polluted marine areas should be a focus of health risk assessments of the local residents. chronic exposure to arsenic leads to global dna demethylation and aberrant gene expression , and even short-term exposure to arsenic can disturb dna methylation patterns  <cit> . environmental cadmium exposure is associated with dna hypomethylation in peripheral blood  <cit> , and some aquatic samples extract with higher concentration of cd also reveal obvious positive demethylation potential after the tdq test.

the method of evaluating the demethylation potential of aquatic food samples is meaningful and few studies have reported on it thus far. a detection system for demethylating agents using an endogenous promoter cpg island was reported  <cit> , but fluorescence cannot be quantified so precisely using only imaging and the results may overlook the confounding cytochromes p <dig> activation effect of environmental pollutants in hepatic cells. moreover, cell lines using an endogenous, epigenetically silenced reporter are convenient for screening demethylating agents  <cit> , but the methylation may be spontaneously lost after many generations and h <dig> lung cancer cells are not the most suitable cell candidates due to the shortage of cytochromes p <dig> enzymes.

the tdq method has several advantages in case of quantifying the total demethylation potential of food samples. first, the task of assessing the hazards of such complex mixtures is complicated, because the actual composition of these mixtures is rarely known and the behavior of mixture components is not fully understood  <cit> . to provide more information for food safety, the tdq method can screen the samples with greater demethylation potential and likely samples may be selected for further scanning analysis of concrete pollutants. second, the method can give an accurate relative quantification of the total demethylation potential of the aquatic sample extracts with 5-aza-cdr dte, which is more convenient for the direct comparison of health risks for different food samples. third, comparing to cells from other organs, the hep g <dig> cell line is more suitable for toxicity evaluation of pollutants and will help the tdq test results more reliable. not only are the hepatic cells just the target cells for toxicity test, but also the hepatic cells may help active pollutants possibly with cytochromes p <dig> enzymes as well  <cit> . moreover, the tdq method is quick and easy to conduct using common equipments.

despite the advantages above, compared with the endogenous promoter, a main drawback of tdq is the exogenous cmv promoter used in this method. there are possibly some pollutants may have demethylation potential and not be sensitive to the demethylation of exogenous promoter, therefore false negative results for the tdq test might existed. strong fluorescence may result first from total demethylation potential and the possible later activation of transcription factors, meaning that false positive cases may appear in the results. the possibility of false positives is small, however, due to the rarity of samples with positive demethylation potential and strong activation of transcription factors. therefore, the explaining the negative results of aquatic samples extract for tdq test should be cautious. the tdq test provides a primary evaluation of total demethylation potential, but the possible mechanisms underlying positive samples should be clarified with further research.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the tdq is a meaningful and rapid assay for the relative quantification of the dna demethylation potential of aquatic food extracts and is a candidate method for the total toxicity evaluation system for the health risk assessment of dietary environmental exposure with respect to epigenetic mechanisms.
