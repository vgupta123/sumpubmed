BACKGROUND
hydrogenosomes are membrane-bounded organelles of anaerobic unicellular eukaryotes that
            produce hydrogen and atp. these elusive organelles were discovered in trichomonad
            flagellates, and eventually identified in quite a number of only distantly related
            unicellular anaerobes such as flagellates, amoeboflagellates, chytridiomycete fungi and
            ciliates  <cit> . hydrogenosomes are phylogenetically related to both mitochondria and the
            various rudimentary, "mitochondrial-remnant" organelles collectively called "mitosomes"  <cit> . the latter organelles are found in organisms previously considered devoid of
            mitochondria, that were once named "archaezoa" by cavalier-smith  <cit> , although one of them, trichomonas vaginalis, actually was already
            known to contain a hydrogenosome.

the hydrogenosomes of the anaerobic ciliate nyctotherus ovalis possess a
            mitochondrial genome and parts of an electron-transport chain on the one hand, and a
            hydrogenase on the other hand  <cit> . because of this combination of features they cannot be classified as being
            either a hydrogenosome or a mitochondrion. it is likely that this organelle evolved from
            a ciliate mitochondrion by the expression of a hydrogenase that enables the ciliate to
            use protons as electron acceptors in order to maintain its metabolic homeostasis under
            anaerobic conditions. a crucial aspect of this hypothesis is the evolutionary origin of
            the n. ovalis hydrogenase itself. this is still a matter of debate since
            phylogenetic analyses suffer from a lack of statistical support due to an insufficient
            sampling of hydrogenases  <cit> .

here we present evidence that the  hydrogenase of n. ovalis does not
            belong to the clade of "ancient eukaryotic" hydrogenases that also include the
            non-hydrogen producing narf's, . the analysis of the h-cluster of  <dig> novel hydrogenases from rumen ciliates
            that were recovered in a metagenomic approach, reveals the existence of another clade of
             hydrogenases from both bacterial and eukaryotic organisms, including the one of
               n. ovalis, but excluding hydrogenases from other ciliates and eukaryotes.

the  hydrogenase of n. ovalis is unique because, by a fusion with two
            nadh dehydrogenase subunits, it is predicted to be capable of reoxidizing nadh directly.
            the two accessory domains responsible for this are homologous to the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda
            subunits of the mitochondrial nadh dehydrogenase  and to the bacterial "small
            hydrogenases" hoxf and hoxu  <cit> . supporting the origin of the hydrogenase by horizontal gene transfer we show
            here that the accessory domains are not closely related to the n. ovalis
            complex i subunits, but rather appear to have been acquired by lateral gene
            transfer from bacterial ancestors that possess a  hydrogenase.

RESULTS
the  <dig> kda/nuoe/hoxf – and  <dig> kda/nuof/hoxu – like regions of
                  the  hydrogenase polyprotein
the hydrogenase of n. ovalis is a polyprotein, consisting of a long-type
                hydrogenase and two  modules with similarity to the  <dig> kda 
               and  <dig> kda  subunits of complex i of mitochondrial and eubacterial respiratory
               chains   <cit> . complex i, the nadh-quinone oxidoreductase, consist of  <dig> subunits in
               eubacteria and of up to  <dig> subunits in  mitochondria  <cit> . it catalyzes the electron transfer from nadh to the quinone pool through
               a series of redox centers. the  <dig> and  <dig> kda subunits are two important modules of
               the hydrophilic  nadh dehydrogenase part of mitochondrial complex i. the 51
               kda subunit contains a -cluster  and binding sites for
               nadh and fmn. the  <dig> kda subunit contains a -cluster   <cit> .
                     and the "mitochondrial"  <dig> and  <dig> kda genes . the macronuclear
                     minichromosomes are capped by telomeres  and contain non-coding dna
                     sequences  at the n- and c-terminal parts of the chromosome. a mitochondrial
                     targeting signal  is found at the n terminal part of the coding sequence.  <dig> 
                     a. the hydrogenase is chimeric, i.e. it consists of a long-type 
                     hydrogenase with  <dig> fes clusters , a  <dig> kda  module
                      with an n1a type fes cluster, and a  <dig> kda   module with a
                     n3-type  cluster plus a fmn and a nad binding site.  <dig>  b. the subunits
                     of the "mitochondrial" complex i are localized on individual minichromosomes.
                     they each possess a mitochondrial targeting signal  and upstream and
                     downstream non-coding dna . the "mitochondrial"  <dig> kda module possesses two
                     small introns  that are absent from the correspondent hydrogenase
                     module.

in n. ovalis two different types of 24/ <dig> kda genes are found:  a
               hydrogenase variant, in which both subunits are fused with each other and with a
                hydrogenase, and  a "mitochondrial" variant, in which the  <dig> kda and 51
               kda genes are located on separate minichromosomes . as
               usual for n. ovalis and some other ciliates, the genes are located on single
               gene containing macronuclear minichromosomes that are capped with telomeres, making
               it unlikely that the genes are a contamination. consistent with their putative
               function in the "mitochondrial"  complex i , these genes
               possess n-terminal leader sequences that likely function as a mitochondrial targeting
               signal. in contrast, the hydrogenase consists of a fusion of the hydrogenase, the 24
               kda and the  <dig> kda subunits. obviously, this "operon" encodes a polyprotein, since it
               is located on a single minichromosome, and, notably, it possesses only one
                "mitochondrial" targeting signal . in
               contrast, both "mitochondrial"  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda possess their individual
               mitochondrial targeting signal. in addition, the "mitochondrial"  <dig> kda variant
               contains two small introns  that are absent in the fused variant.

a multiple sequence alignment of the "mitochondrial" complex i subunits and 24
               kda/hoxf and  <dig> kda/hoxu -like sequences of the hydrogenases of several n. ovalis
               species reveals that the hydrogenase modules are more similar to the nuoe
               and nuof genes of a bacterial complex i than to a mitochondrial complex
               i . the  <dig> kda-like module of the n. ovalis
               hydrogenase possesses only three of the four conserved cysteine residues that
               bind the  cluster n1a found in both mitochondrial  <dig> kda subunits and
               bacterial nuoe's. the fourth cysteine residue of the hydrogenosomal  cluster
               has been replaced consistently by a tryptophane in all n. ovalis  <dig> kda
               subunits sequenced . stereochemical considerations and mutagenisation studies in bacterial
                  nuoe genes have suggested that this c/w replacement most likely does not
               interfere with the ferredoxin-like function of the hydrogenosomal  <dig> kda module  <cit> . the  <dig> kda-like region of both the hydrogenase domain and the putative
               mitochondrial complex i subunits contain a nadh binding domain with four conserved
               glycine residues. in addition, also a fmn binding site with its conserved glycine and
               proline residues, and the four conserved cysteine residues of the  cluster n3
               are found in both the  <dig> kda subunits of mitochondrial complex i and its bacterial
               nuof homologues .

phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> kda-like region of the n. ovalis hydrogenase
               is hampered by a lack of data, especially from ciliates and other protozoa.
               nevertheless, it shows clearly that this module of the n. ovalis hydrogenase
               has a bacterial rather than a mitochondrial ancestry .
               the  <dig> kda-like module from the hydrogenase clusters with its homologues from
                  beta- and gamma-proteobacteria and the hoxf subunits of
               soluble nad-reducing -hydrogenases of beta-proteobacteria, and not
               with its mitochondrial paralogues. all  <dig> kda-like genes belonging to this clade are
               fused with their corresponding  <dig> kda modules supporting the assumption of a close
               phylogenetic relation . the
                  mitochondrial  <dig> kda  subunit of n. ovalis, on the other
               hand, clusters closely with its homologues from aerobic, mitochondriate ciliates.
               this clade belongs to a mitochondrial/alpha-proteobacterial sample of
               sequences that are only distantly related to  <dig> kda sequences from beta- and
                  gamma- proteobacteria and archaebacteria. none these sequences is fused
               with a  <dig> kda gene.

                     bacterial hydrogenase subunits. see methods for the accession numbers and how
                     the tree was calculated. h: n. ovalis hydrogenase, m: ciliate

                     ≥  <dig>  box  <dig> marks  <dig> kda modules that are fused with their
                     corresponding  <dig> kda modules . all bacteria in this box  have a  hydrogenase. the
                     mitochondrial/alpha-proteobacterial  <dig> kda modules are not fused with their 51
                     kda counterparts .

similar to the phylogeny of the  <dig> kda modules, phylogenetic analysis of the  <dig> kda
               module of the hydrogenase of n. ovalis shows that it is closely related to
               the hoxf subunits of soluble nad-reducing -hydrogenases of
               beta-proteobacteria such as rhodococcus opacus and ralstonia
               eutropha, and the fused variants from beta- and
               gamma-proteobacteria . the hydrogenase module
               of n. ovalis is more distantly related to the nuof and  <dig> kda
               genes of the various representatives of alpha-proteobacterial or
               mitochondrial complex i genes. in contrast, the mitochondrial  <dig> kda subunit of
                  n. ovalis clusters with high support with its homologues from aerobic
                ciliates and many other eukaryotes and
               alpha-proteobacteria. it is also clearly distinct from the corresponding
               nadp/formate reducing hydrogenases of certain archaea and alpha proteobacteria . these observations unequivocally exclude a mitochondrial
               or alpha-proteobacterial origin of the  <dig> and  <dig> kda modules of the
               hydrogenase of n. ovalis.
                     ovalis, mitochondrial complex i  <dig> kda subunits, bacterial nuof, and
                     bacterial hydrogenase subunits. see methods for how the tree was calculated. h:
                        n. ovalis hydrogenase, m: ciliate mitochondrial. only bootstraps
                     ≥  <dig> are indicated in the tree. box  <dig> marks the fused modules , box  <dig> the non-fused
                     modules of mitochondrial and alpha-proteobacterial origin. all bacteria in box
                      <dig>  have a 
                     hydrogenase.

the phylogenetic analysis of the complete hydrogenase of n. ovalis is
               hampered by the high sequence conservation and the modular organisation of the
               bacterial and eukaryotic  hydrogenases  <cit> . this implicates that only the "h-cluster", a rather small piece of the
               total hydrogenase, can be used in a phylogenetic analysis that includes all
               eukaryotic  hydrogenases. also, the very limited sampling of eukaryotic
               hydrogenases restricts the phylogenetic reconstruction, suggesting an unresolved,
               deep eukaryotic origin for most of these hydrogenases  <cit> . therefore, we undertook a metagenomic approach to retrieve
               hydrogenase-encoding dna sequence information from the highly diverse and numerous
               community of anaerobic ciliates thriving in the rumen of cattle, sheep, and goat  <cit> . using primers directed against conserved regions of the h-cluster  we sequenced  <dig> clones derived from the total rumen ciliate dna. in
               addition, we determined the homologous dna sequences from  <dig> validated type strains of
               rumen ciliates. phylogenetic analysis of this extended data set reveals the existence
               of two clades of eukaryotic  hydrogenases, indicated by h <dig> and h <dig> in figure
                   <dig>  the h <dig> clade contains the majority of the eukaryotic
               sequences, including the nar's.

                     "classical "  hydrogenases and nar's. block  <dig> is characterized by the
                     clade of trichomonas vaginalis 
                     hydrogenases. it hosts also the majority of the rumen sequences plus the
                     hydrogenases from the type-strain rumen ciliates epidinium ecaudatum,
                        ophryoscolex caudatus, and isotricha intestinalis. block 2

                     dominated by n. ovalis. besides n. ovalis and its close
                     relatives, this clade consists of hydrogenases from the amoeboflagellate
                        psalteriomonas lanterna, the rumen ciliate epidinium
                     ecaudatum, the free-living ciliate trimyema sp. and the rumen
                      sequences hyd  <dig>  a fusion of the h-cluster with the  <dig> and 51
                     kda modules has so far only been observed for the n. ovalis clade. the
                        psalteriomonas hydrogenase has no fused 24/ <dig> kda modules.

the h <dig> clade comprises all hydrogenase sequences from n. ovalis and its
               intestinal and free-living relatives. in addition, the h-clusters from two rumen
               ciliates, one amoeboflagellate, and the ciliate trimyema sp. belong to this
               clade – besides sequences from the delta-proteobacterium
                  desulfovibrio vulgaris and the alpha-proteobacterium
                  rhodopseudomonas palustris. a bacterial, i.e. endo/episymbiotic origin of
               the sequences derived from the two rumen ciliates and the ciliate trimyema
               cannot be excluded at the current state of information. the ciliate origin of
               the n. ovalis sequences has been confirmed by their assignment to gene-sized
               macronuclear chromosomes that are characteristic for nyctotherus and its
               relatives. furthermore, the codon usage is characteristic for n. ovalis . the hydrogenase of the amoeboflagellate psalteriomonas lanterna, on
               the other hand has recently been recovered from cdna thereby revealing the absence of
               c-terminal 24/ <dig> kda modules . thus, the existence of two different
               eukaryotic hydrogenase clades is clearly supported, with a clustering of the n.
                  ovalis sequence with those from desulfovibrio vulgaris and
                  rhodopseudomonas palustris. the relationship of both clades to other
               bacterial hydrogenases remains poorly resolved, but there is no evidence for any
               close relationship to those bacterial taxa that are supposed to be the source for the
               hydrogenosomal 24/ <dig> kda modules., indicating an independent origin for the hydrogenase on the one hand and
               the 24/ <dig> kda modules on the other hand.

the  hydrogenase of n. ovalis is chimeric and has been acquired by
                  lateral gene transfer
as shown above, the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda modules of the hydrogenase of n. ovalis
               are neither of mitochondrial nor of alpha-proteobacterial origin. given
               the presence of paralogues of genuine mitochondrial descent that encode constituents
               of a functional mitochondrial/hydrogenosomal complex i  <cit> , an acquisition of the whole hydrogenase by lateral gene transfer from
               different sources is very likely.

both the  <dig> kda and  <dig> kda modules might have been acquired from
               beta-proteobacteria similar to rhodococcus or ralstonia,
               which possess  hydrogenase modules, rather than  hydrogenases  <cit> . notably, in rhodococcus or ralstonia the  <dig> kda and 51
               kda subunits belong to a rather oxygen-resistant  hydrogenase, which is not
               homologous to the -hydrogenases  <cit> . an analysis of the codon usage of the various hydrogenase components and
               their mitochondrial orthologues  reveals that  the
               hydrogenase modules have acquired the host-specific codon-usage,  hydrogenase
               modules cluster with hydrogenase modules, and  mitochondrial genes with
               mitochondrial genes.
                     mitochondrial 24/ <dig> kda modules. while most of the n. ovalis strains
                     exhibit only slight differences in codon-preference, the isolate n. ovalis
                     from the host cockroach p. americana strain amsterdam has a
                     substantially different codon-usage. in both cases, the bacterial-derived 24
                     and  <dig> kda modules acquired the typical ciliate codon-usage that is not
                     significantly different from the one used for the 
                     mitochondrial modules. even the top-down distribution shows a complete
                     ameliorisation of the modules.

why acquire a -only hydrogenase?
we have shown recently that the hydrogenosome of n. ovalis is a ciliate-type
               mitochondrion that produces hydrogen  <cit> . the presence of a mitochondrial genome, mitochondrial complex i and ii
               dependent respiratory-chain activity, in combination with a kind of
               fumarate-respiration identifies the n. ovalis hydrogenosome as an
               intermediate stage in the evolution of mitochondria to hydrogenosomes  <cit> . but why acquire a hydrogenase at all? it is likely that the
               ancestral mitochondrion of n. ovalis oxidised nadh via an electron transport
               chain – as indicated by the presence of genes encoding components of
               mitochondrial complex i and ii. an adaptation to anaerobic environments might be
               greatly facilitated by the acquisition of a hydrogenase, which could use nadh. it is
               obvious that the use of fumarate alone as endogenous electron acceptor requires a
               well-controlled balance between the various catabolic and anabolic reactions in the
               cell. depending on the metabolic state of the cell, the nadh pool might be subject to
               large fluctuations. the presence of alternative oxidases in anaerobic mitochondria
               provides a means for the cell to cope with such fluctuations in the nadh pool  <cit> . such an alternative oxidase appears to be absent in n. ovalis,
               and the hydrogenase could fulfil the task to regulate the nadh pool. the chimeric
               -hydrogenase of n. ovalis is tailored for this requirement since it
               allows a direct re-oxidation of nadh, due to the presence of the  <dig> and  <dig> kda
               modules. other  hydrogenases, e.g. those of trichomonas vaginalis,
               require ferredoxin for hydrogen production from pfo-generated reduction equivalents,
               and a diaphorase to reoxidise nadh. thus, a hydrogenase like the one found in n.
                  ovalis, provides many advantages for an organism adapting to anaerobic
               environments. since there is no evidence for the presence of hydrogenases in
               mitochondria/protomitochondria  <cit> , the scenario for the evolution of the hydrogenosomes of n. ovalis
               from ciliate mitochondria as described here, is likely to have involved complex
               lateral gene transfer and the fusion of functional domains. the fusion of genes of
               different origin has at least two advantages: guaranteeing the synthesis of all
               components in equimolar amounts, and facilitating the flow of electrons from nadh to
                  h+ in a single molecule. lastly, the evolution of a hydrogenosomal
               polyprotein requires only the acquisition of a single mitochondrial targeting signal,
               which can be acquired easily as demonstrated by the frequent retargeting of proteins
               in the evolution of the eukaryotic cell  <cit> .

hydrogenases and the origin of mitochondria
the scenario depicted here for the origin of the n. ovalis hydrogenase, in
               which a hydrogenase was added to an aerobic mitochondrion does not necessarily hold
               for other hydrogenosomes, because they have evolved independently of n. ovalis
               and because they are metabolically less similar to mitochondria than is the
                  n. ovalis organelle, e.g. in the way they metabolise pyruvate. n.
                  ovalis uses a "mitochondrial" pyruvate dehydrogenase that reduces nad, which
               can subsequently be reoxidized by the hydrogenase that has acquired nadh-oxidizing
               domains. in contrast, the hydrogenosome of trichomonas species metabolise
               pyruvate via a pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase <cit>  and the anaerobic chytrids metabolise it via a pyruvate formate-lyase <cit> . the proteins in the hydrogenosomes of anaerobic chytrids are
               phylogenetically related to the proteins in the mitochondria of aerobic fungi,
               suggesting also here the evolution of the hydrogenosome as a secondary adaptation to
               anaerobic circumstances. trichomonas, however, appears in many-sequence
               based phylogenies at the root of the eukaryotic tree and does not have aerobic,
               mitochondria containing relatives. a scenario as depicted in the hydrogen hypothesis
               of martin and müller  <cit> , in which the ancestral organelle of all mitochondria and hydrogenosomes
               had both a respiratory chain and a hydrogenase can therefore not be ruled out. it
               should thereby be noted that t. vaginalis, just like n. ovalis has
               the nadh oxidizing elements of complex i, but, in contrast to n. ovalis,
               does not have the other proteins of this complex  <cit> , and is with respect to complex i more like schizosaccharomyces pombe  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
n. ovalis acquired its unique  hydrogenase by lateral gene transfer from
            two different sources. given that n. ovalis performs a kind of fumarate
            respiration allowing survival under anaerobic conditions, the acquisition of this
            peculiar  hydrogenase allows an additional regulation of the nadh pool, which is
            crucial for maintaining the metabolic homeostasis under anaerobic conditions.
