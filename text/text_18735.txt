BACKGROUND
infectious salmon anemia virus  is a pathogen that has been associated with high fish mortality in the aquaculture industry  <cit> . the cumulative mortality associated with each outbreak of isav in norway and other countries is very high, reaching up to 100% of fish stock in some cases  <cit> . isav has been classified as the only member of isavirus genus belonging to the orthomyxoviridae family, which includes influenza viruses  <cit> . virions consist mainly of a membranous envelope with two surface glycoproteins and a matrix protein surrounding a ribonucleoprotein complex. association of nucleoprotein, three polymerase subunits and the genomic rna, in turn, forms the ribonucleoprotein complex. virion morphology varies from spherical to pleiomorphic. the enveloped virus particles are of 45- <dig> nm in diameter, however, highly pleiomorphic particles up to  <dig> nm in the longest dimension are occasionally observed. the genome organization is consistent with other members of the orthomyxoviridae; comprising of  <dig> segments of single stranded negative sense rna  ssrna), in which each segment encodes one protein except segments  <dig> and  <dig>  which encode two /three  and two proteins, respectively  <cit> . four major structural proteins have been identified, including a  <dig> kda nucleoprotein, a  <dig> kda matrix protein, a  <dig> kda surface glycoprotein named haemagglutinin-esterase protein with receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activity, and a  <dig> kda surface glycoprotein with fusion activity, coded by genome segments  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. segments  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> encode the putative viral polymerase subunits pb <dig>  pb <dig>  and pa. the orf <dig> of segment  <dig> encodes a nonstructural protein with interferon antagonistic properties, while orf <dig> encodes a nuclear export protein. the smaller orf <dig> of segment  <dig> encodes the matrix protein, while the larger orf <dig> encodes an rna-binding structural protein also with interferon antagonistic properties  <cit> .

regarding the genes coding for surface proteins, he genes exhibit a length polymorphism close to the 3' end called highly polymorphic region  that has been related to virulence, although this is not entirely clear  <cit> . in turn, f genes seem to be more conserved in length, with the exception of the region next to the putative protease-processing site   <cit> . the fusion protein in isav is synthesized as a precursor protein designated as f <dig>  in order to exert its biological function, f <dig> must be cleaved by cellular proteases to generate f <dig> and f <dig>  <cit> . several insertions of 10- <dig> amino acids , identical to sequences from other genomic segments, have been suggested to confer novel protease cleavage sites  <cit> , and thus they could be subjected to positive selection.

unlike other members of the orthomyxoviridae family that commonly infect mammals or birds, isav naturally infects fishes of the salmonidae family. although natural outbreaks of isa have only been recorded in farmed atlantic salmon , the virus has been isolated also from rainbow trout   <cit>  and coho salmon  in chile  <cit> . the disease was first reported in norway and the virus was associated with the disease in  <dig>  at present, isav has been reported in canada , usa , scotland , the faroe islands , and recently in chile  <cit> . because of the worldwide distribution and the potential for serious economical losses, isav has been listed as a non-exotic disease for the european union  and is therefore monitored closely by the european community reference laboratory for fish diseases http://www.crl-fish.eu/.

in general, phylogenetic studies of infectious diseases have been centered on human and zoonotic diseases with little attention to enzootic pathogens, although with few exceptions, for example, in plant viruses' crop-related diseases  <cit> . given the human health impact, phylogenetic studies of orthomyxoviruses have been largely devoted to influenza viruses in particular to influenza a  <cit> . to date, questions related to global distributions, molecular evolution and adaptations, sources of genetic diversity and emergence of new isolates have been extensively addressed in the influenza literature. however, little has been done with its relatives, e.g., isav, even when the same genetic structure, and presumably, similar evolutionary forces might be acting on isav populations.

in  <dig> an isav belonging to the north american  genotype was isolated from coho salmon in chile and the first outbreak of isav in marine-farmed atlantic salmon in the southern hemisphere occurred in the same country starting in june  <dig>  given that there are no known natural hosts for isav in chile, only a few studies have investigated whether the outbreak source came from north america or europe by using basic phylogenetic methods  <cit> .

in this study, we apply more sophisticated phylogenetic and population genetic methods to currently available sequence data to address questions regarding the  <dig> chilean isav outbreak. in particular, we asked  whether recombination is a relevant force acting on f and he genes,  whether the age estimates of the chilean clade agree with epidemiological data, and  whether population processes leave marks in isav genomes that allow us to reconstruct its demographic history. finally, we developed new improved structural homology models with which positively selected sites were mapped to relate them with functional traits.

RESULTS
we included  <dig> isolates from canada, chile and norway for which both genes, f and he, were available along with their sampling dates. the length of the final alignments was  <dig> and  <dig> bp, respectively . we selected tvm as the best-fit nucleotide substitution model for both genes based on akaike information criterion   <cit> . rate heterogeneity was estimated as the gamma distributed shape parameter Î± =  <dig>  and  <dig>  for f and he, respectively. we also tested for whether the data were best explained by a strict or relaxed molecular clock. bayes factor hypothesis testing favored the relaxed model in both cases . this was further supported by the coefficient of variation and ucld.stdv parameters.

genetic diversity and recombination
in order to explore the data and to see whether recombination plays a recognizable role in isav evolution, we estimated the population genetic parameter theta  and recombination rate  for each population. when calculated under the infinite-sites assumption, the canadian and chilean populations were more diverse than the older norwegian population . in turn, when using a coalescent sampler estimator, the norwegian population turned out to be, as expected, more than three times more diverse  <dig>   than the young chilean population  <dig>  , and than the canadian population  <dig>   as well. although at first this seems contradictory, coalescent-based estimators of genetic diversity are far more reliable than those based on segregating sites  <cit> . by taking into account evolutionary history, coalescent-based estimates are more robust to model assumptions and allow us to determine factors influencing the observed patterns . this overall result has practical implications as less diverse populations, i.e., genetically homogeneous, would be more susceptible to vaccines and antiviral treatments whereas more structured populations, i.e., individuals genetically similar within populations but different among populations, make effective vaccine and antiviral deliveries more difficult. so, population genetic inferences can be instrumental in fish health surveillance programs as demonstrated in human health settings  <cit> .

antisense  ssrna viruses are less prone to recombination than their  sense counterparts  <cit> . in principle this would arise from the impossibility of  ssrna viruses to serve as templates for negative sense strand synthesis once the genome is uncoated, in turn rendering copy choice recombination less likely. in addition,  ssrna genomes are generally protected by viral nucleoproteins that prevent genome exposure to the cytoplasm  and to come in close contact with other genome copies, thus rendering copy-choice recombination also unlikely. also, the segmented genome structure of some  ssrna relaxes even more the occurrence of recombination by yielding the same outcome when shuffling segments . in agreement with this hypothesis, our results showed a low overall recombination force  of ) expressed as the ratio of recombination rate per site over substitution rate per site. however, recombination does happen in human  <cit>  and avian  <cit>  strains of influenza viruses as well as in some segments in isav, namely segments  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in this sense, we tested our dataset to see whether or not it is possible to detect recombination breakpoints. using a suite of methods  <cit> , we consistently detected one possible recombination breakpoint in the vicinity of the he hpr region. this result was confirmed by substitution and phylogenetic algorithms and was further corroborated by phylogenetic topological incongruence using a genetic algorithm . since full-length hpr  has been detected only in natural populations  and different hpr alleles co-occur in the same fish-farming location, these results support the hypothesis that the hpr region is the product of template switching during replication , and opens the possibility of testing it in controlled experimental settings. early indications of recombination in the he gene were reported in  <dig>  when researchers looked for topological incongruence and possible recombination patterns 'by eye' within he norwegian sequences  <cit> . interestingly, they found that recombination was associated with the geographic location of the isolates and that it occurred at either side of the hpr region. our results provide statistical support for this initial observation as we detected a topological incongruence at nucleotide  <dig> . we also detected recombination breakpoint signals at either side of the hpr; however, it was not possible to detect parental sequences with confidence . this evidence contradicts the hypothesis of cunningham et al.  <cit>  that the most plausible mechanism of recombination is that each hpr comes from partial deletions of precursor hpr <dig> 

regarding the f gene, we do not detect any recombination breakpoints. at first this was surprising since small non-homologous fragments have been observed at around 266- <dig>  which might confer novel protease cleavage sites  and therefore have a fitness impact. we think there are at least two potential reasons for our inability to detect recombination in this gene region. first, small fragments are hard to detect with current methods because of the low information they contain. second, methods are not designed to explicitly look for non-homologous recombination. also, it would be hard to detect if the ins are evolutionarily linked to the f gene and/or have similar substitution rates.

phylogenetic inference and past population dynamics
in order to estimate phylogenetic relationships, we used bayesian phylogenetic methods to test the chilean outbreak isolates for monophyly, to estimate rates of molecular evolution across the genomes, and estimate divergence times for clades of particular interest . recombination has detrimental effects on phylogeny estimation and phylogeny-based analyses  <cit>  and thus the recombinant portion of the he gene was not included in these analyses. segmented viruses have the potential to re-assort their segments in novel combinations, which in phylogenetic terms has the same effect as recombination. therefore, we estimated phylogenies and molecular evolution parameters separately for each gene since concatenating both datasets would render inaccurate inferences as isav might exhibit reassortment between segments.

in the case of the f gene, the chilean outbreak clade was inferred as monophyletic suggesting that isav was introduced once in chilean fish farming . however, the he gene tree  shows that outbreak isolates spread in two clades, i.e., paraphyletic; one composed of most of the outbreak isolates and the other composed of three isolates that are also closely related to isolates from norway . for both genes, posterior probability support was close or equal to  <dig>  either for f monophyletic outbreak clade or he paraphyletic outbreak clades. we speculate that this might be the consequence of reassortment as he genes from chile exhibit two evolutionary pathways. interestingly, the hpr <dig> allele  is suggested to be the precursor of all hpr alleles by differential deletion of the polymorphic region  <cit> . however, in both gene trees, sk779/06hpr <dig>  does not share a most recent common ancestor with all the alleles, but it does for the chilean outbreak alleles. this result suggests that the ancestor of the hpr <dig> allele is not necessarily the precursor of all modern hprs. nevertheless, this result agrees with the hypothesis that the isav that finally led to the chilean outbreak was not virulent  <cit> . overall, these results are in rough agreement with previously published phylogenies using other methods. however, our analysis fully resolved relationships in crown nodes and allowed us to estimate molecular evolutionary parameters taking into account phylogenetic and parameter uncertainty. we focused in two events in the evolutionary history of the virus, the time in which norwegian and chilean isolates diverged, and the time in which the chilean epidemic clade expanded. whether it was in norway or in chile, the most recent common ancestor  between norwegian and chilean isolates was estimated to have occurred in  <dig>  and the chilean clade expansion in  <dig>  for the f gene. for the he gene, in turn, the mrca was  <dig>  and  <dig> . this is in agreement with reported distance-based analyses for the f gene but not for the he gene  <cit> . however, those methodologies do not provide confidence estimates in a probabilistic framework, which, in turn, could allow for meaningful comparisons. for instance, our estimates show that both segments have different evolutionary histories since they coalesce at significantly different points back in time . together with the paraphyly of the he outbreak clade, the results suggest that the ancestor between norwegian and chilean isolates underwent reassortment of at least both surface protein genes. ancestral state reconstruction  clearly shows that chilean isolates came from norway as previously hypothesized and this result is consistent across both genes .

as other  ssrna viruses, isav exhibited extremely high substitution rates. similar to influenza viruses, isav replication machinery lacks proofreading activity, which has been proposed as the increased source of variability in rna viruses  <cit> . accordingly, substitution rates were estimated at  <dig>  Ã 10- <dig> substitutions per site per year   for the f gene and  <dig>  Ã 10- <dig>   for the he gene .

an interesting aspect of phylogenetic analyses is to infer processes from patterns in the time coordinate. we hypothesized that if isav is such a fast-evolving entity, its genome must contain information that could be used to infer ecological and/or population processes. for isav, we inferred a population level process of a bottleneck, i.e., a population going through one or more generations of small size followed by subsequent population growth, perhaps associated with the outbreak it recently experienced around  <dig> when it was first officially reported in chile http://www.sernapesca.cl. we reconstructed generation time-scaled effective population size  through time to see whether or not it is possible to recover that bottleneck using the bayesian skyline non-parametric model   <cit>  . interestingly, the analysis shows a strong reduction in population size around  <dig> followed by a nearly exponential growth. in particular, the greatest reduction in population size was inferred from the f gene and occurred in  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the he gene . one assumption of analyses based on the coalescent and thus the bsp is that the dataset comprises one non-structured population. although not explored in depth in the literature, population structure, in principle, could lead to biased estimates of substitution rates and associated parameters. this, in turn, can produce patterns in the bsp that reflect changes in the degree of structure instead of changes in the overall population size, especially when using a single marker  <cit> . to address this potential problem, we calculated parsimony score  and association index  for both genes under study. these statistics aim to assert the degree of association of a discrete character, geographic location in this case, with a posterior distribution of trees. both ps and ai statistics were significant , suggesting that it is possible to reject the null hypothesis of one non-structured population. considering that two independent genes showed similar patterns, and that the bsp correlates well with surveillance data, plus the agreement of substitution rate estimates with others  <cit> , we think is safe to assume that these results reflect a population bottleneck. certainly, simulation studies will aid to assert how robust bsp estimates are to structured populations.

although controversial, vike et al.  <cit>  suggested that the source of isav in the chilean outbreak were infected eggs brought from norway, which could be explained by the fact that until  <dig> this country was the main provider of embryonated eggs http://www.sernapesca.cl. it is clear that the chilean outbreak clade has a sister relationship with norwegian isolates ; see figure 2), that the basal clades and ancestral nodes in the phylogeny are from norway, and that the tmrca is around 1989- <dig>  which matches the date when egg importation grew from less than  <dig> million to  <dig> million imported units http://www.sernapesca.cl. in addition, the bsp analysis shows that the isav population increased exponentially since  <dig>  suggesting that the virus population remained constant since  <dig>  and that the outbreak was publicly reported one year after this predicted population expansion. these results constitute valuable information for fish health officials to make informed future decisions based on what contingency measures were implemented at the time of transmission from norway to chile. for instance, it is very interesting to note that in  <dig> the main isav genotype detected in chile corresponded to hpr <dig> http://www.sernapesca.cl. conversely, hpr7b was nearly 80% prevalent between epidemic years  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . this could be attributed to the change of source material from norway to iceland in  <dig>  for a future study it would be interesting to address the origin of newly detected avirulent hpr <dig> strains that would come from a country other than norway.

selection analysis and structure models
in order to find potentially relevant sites in the primary sequence of both surface genes and to determine possible structure-function relations, we used a two-rate fixed-effects likelihood  approach to find positively selected sites . in a gene-based approach, we found that both genes are evolving under purifying selection  as expected for fast-evolving entities with relatively small genomes .

using a site-by-site approach, we found that the he gene has two sites under positive selection within codons in positions  <dig> and  <dig> . in the he gene, amino acid val/leu <dig> is located specifically on the globular distal domain , which is related to he protein main function, i.e., cell receptor recognition  <cit> . amino acid ser/arg/gly/ala <dig> lies upstream the hpr region, located in the stalk of the protein , which prompted us to hypothesize that it might be involved in recombination. interestingly, the expression of recombinant isav heÎ339- <dig> results in decreased expression levels, impaired salmon serum recognition, and hema-adsorption activity. in contrast, heÎ349- <dig> shows normal parameters  <cit> , suggesting that positively selected amino acid in position  <dig> is due to its great importance for he activity.

we also found three sites under positive selection in the f gene within codons that code for amino acid residues  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . it was not possible to reliably model the f gene protein product structure. however, we were able to map amino acid ala/gly/thr <dig>  which lies immediately downstream of insertions   <cit> . this constitutes an interesting finding given that insertions in this region have been reported to confer novel ppps  <cit> , as outlined in figure 1f. in addition, ala/gly/thr <dig> lies immediately downstream to arg <dig> , a putative cleavage site  <cit>  that has been suggested as a virulence factor  <cit> . conversely, a recent study suggested that substitution of gln/his <dig> to leu <dig>  in isav fusion protein without insertion is in association with an increase of virulence behavior, as seen in chilean isav  <dig> strain  <cit> . this has epidemiological implications as isolates carrying these elements would have an advantage compared to those that do not. this finding predicts that the frequency of these alleles will increase in the populations where they are present, e.g., in <dig>  which is only found in chile with almost 80% prevalence. it has been suggested that ins close to the cleavage site exposes this region to the solvent probably helping in recognition and processing. our improved model shows that insertions lie inside the alpha helix structure that is enlarged with subsequent addition of residues, which leads to the consequent exposure of pppss , in comparison with isav <dig> fusion protein without insertion . these findings also support the notion that in's serve as virulence determinants. for instance, the unique insertion, in <dig>  provides a cleavage site for asp-n endopeptidase metalloprotease, which has been detected in the skin mucosa of salmonids  <cit> . since the hpr in he as well as the ins in f are associated with virulence and are also under natural selection pressure, we think that experimental confirmation of these results will lead to a better understanding of molecular determinants of pathogenicity for both surface proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, this study investigated the evolutionary history of isav, an important economic infection for salmon culture worldwide. although less exploited in non-human diseases, phylogenetic and phylodynamic analyses characterize pathogens in space and time, which is perfectly suited for surveillance programs. for instance, identification of the origin of an outbreak could aid officials in formulating management policies. though not pursued in this study, phylogeographic analyses could help identify virus sources and venues from which pathogens are spreading into different populations or fisheries. reconstructing past population dynamics could help monitor how an infectious agent is changing or reacting to sanitary interventions in terms of its effective population size. also, examining molecular sequences for positive selection, all in a structural context, can identify determinants of virulence or other molecular adaptations.

in this study we found that isav, as its relatives,  exhibit a low recombination rate, though recombination is present in the he surface gene. we hypothesized that hpr region diversity is governed by recombination probably due to template switching.  we also provided more evidence in favor of the norwegian origin hypothesis in a coherent phylogenetic and statistical framework. contrary to the widely accepted view  <cit> ,  isav hpr <dig> genotype is not the precursor of all isav he genotypes, but appears to share a common ancestor with the chilean outbreak clade. finally,  we identified potential determinants of fitness as identified by being under positive selection in a structural context; the protein models allowed us to relate the results of phylogenetic studies with the predicted structures, which suggest an important structural function for the predicted positively selected sites. our analysis shows that the isav outbreak remained undetected in chile since  <dig> and that the population started to increase prior to the identification of the outbreak. thus, we demonstrate the utility of evolutionary analyses in characterizing temporal, spatial, and mechanistic aspects of isav outbreaks, as well as their use in predicting future outbreaks of isav and other pathogens. undoubtedly, collaboration between basic experimental research and phylogenetic fields will help understand the dynamics of isav spread in space and time as it has proven fruitful in human health and emerging infectious diseases studies.
