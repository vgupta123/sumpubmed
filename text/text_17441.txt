BACKGROUND
plant extracts have been used as flavor, fragrances, and medicines for millennia. more recently, it has been possible to trace these desirable properties to specific natural products. however, these often are not found in large amounts in the native producing plants. moreover, in many cases, these turn out to be complex compounds not readily accessible by synthetic means. thus, their use is limited by availability. in addition, the full potential of promising natural products is restrained by these same factors, which prevents not only direct investigation, but also semi-synthetic optimization of their desirable properties . these issues potentially could be relieved by elucidation of the relevant biosynthesis – e.g., to enable metabolic engineering to provide access to the targeted natural product or variants thereof either in the native host or recombinant systems. however, our ability to carry out such investigations has been hindered by the limited information generally available for the plant of interest.

the genus salvia contains almost  <dig>  identified species, many of which are well known for their aromatic properties and/or pharmological uses, which are attributable to a wealth of specialized metabolites, mainly terpenoids and phenylpropanoids. many of these species are traditionally used as medicinal herbs. for example, salvia miltiorrhiza, also known as “danshen”, has recorded medical usage dating back to nearly two thousand years ago. danshen is an important traditional chinese medicine, the rhizome of which has been used extensively for the treatment of coronary heart diseases, particularly angina pectoris and myocardial infarction  <cit> . the tanshinones are abietane-type norditerpenoid quinones that make up the bioactive lipophilic pigments from the intensely red rhizome of s. miltiorrhiza and exhibit a variety of pharmaceutical effects, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, and broad antitumor activities  <cit> . this has been attributed to their inhibition of the hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig>  <cit> , negative regulation of the pi3k signaling pathway  <cit> , and/or inhibition of the aurora a kinase  <cit> . due to their important medicinal activity, chemical syntheses of tanshinones and their analogs have attracted great attention since the early 1960s  <cit> , but these are still limited by low yields  <cit> . on the other hand, hairy root cultures of s. miltiorrhiza make tanshinones  <cit> , where their production can be induced  <cit> , providing a model system for investigation of tanshinone biosynthesis  <cit> .

as terpenoids, the tanshinones originate from more general isoprenoid metabolism. in plants, the isoprenoid precursors isopentenyl diphosphate  and dimethylallyl diphosphate  are derived from two distinct pathways, the mevalonate  pathway operating in the cytosol, and the 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate  pathway occurring in plastids  <cit> . while the biosynthesis of diterpenoids is initiated in plastids, cross-talk between the mva and mep pathways has been shown  <cit> , and tanshinone production has been shown to be reduced by the mva pathway inhibitor mevinolin  <cit> , as well as stimulated by overexpression of the key mva pathway enzyme 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coa reductase   <cit> . nevertheless, the tanshinones are mainly derived from the mep pathway  <cit> .

due to its medical importance, tanshinone biosynthesis has been heavily investigated. this includes some expressed sequence tag  studies of danshen hairy root cultures induction  <cit> . these studies led to the identification of some enzymes from the mva pathway  <cit> , and, more critically, enzymes specific to tanshinone biosynthesis. in particular, the relevant cyclases, copalyl diphosphate synthase  and kaurene synthase-like , which together catalyze the formation of miltiradiene from the general diterpenoid precursor geranylgeranyl diphosphate , with miltiradiene representing a plausible precursor to the tanshinones  <cit> . recently, application of a modular pathway engineering  strategy has led to significant production levels of miltiradiene in the yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae, providing a platform on which further investigations can be carried out  <cit> .

despite these advances, further elucidation of tanshinone biosynthesis has been retarded by the limited sequence information available for s. miltiorrhiza. the previous est studies identified only a few thousand genes, representing < 20% of the expected transcriptome, and there is no genome sequence yet available  <cit> . given our interest in obtaining a deeper understanding of tanshinone metabolism, we undertook a combined metabolomic and transcriptomic investigation of the elicitation process in s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures that leads to the production of tanshinones.

RESULTS
metabolomic analysis of induced s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures
we developed s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures by infecting sterile plantlets  with a ri t-dna bearing agrobacterium rhizogenes . such hairy roots are homogeneous and known to accumulate tanshinones, providing an ideal model system for studying tanshinone biosynthesis  <cit> . using the previously reported combined biotic  and abiotic  induction method  <cit> , the expected strong accumulation of tanshinones in these hairy root cultures was observed . we conducted a large-scale non-targeted metabolite analysis using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with diode array detection and quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry  to identify functional components secreted by s. miltiorrhiza following elicitation. a total of  <dig>  unfiltered peaks were detected from the obtained data using the mzmine lc-ms toolbox  <cit> . principal components analysis   <cit>  on mean centered data identified two major principle components that could clearly separate the elicited and control samples . the first principal component mainly reflected changes at  <dig> or more hrs post induction , which accounted for over 79% of the total variability, whereas the second principle component mainly reflected earlier changes . hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated that the expression of many tanshinone related compounds exhibited dramatic increases at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . moreover, five of these metabolites were identified from the pca loading plot to have the most significant contribution to the first principal component, namely tanshinone iia, cryptotanshinone,  <dig> -dihydrotanshinone, trijuganone b, and dihydrotanshinone i . examination of ultra-performance liquid chromatography  results showed that the content of all these metabolites increased significantly at the later examined time points, especially at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi .

transcriptomic analysis of induced s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures
as the genome sequence of s. miltiorrhiza is not yet available, and we were most interested in transcribed genes in any case, we carried out transcriptomic analysis of the induced s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures. previous investigations of rice diterpenoid biosynthesis had demonstrated that transcriptional responses precede phytochemical accumulation  <cit> . accordingly, we focused on earlier time points following elicitation of the s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures . we first used the roche  <dig> sequencing technology to generate a reference transcriptome from a pooled cdna library . this yielded  <dig> , <dig> reads, totaling  <dig> , <dig> bases, which were assembled into a total of  <dig>  non-redundant isotigs with lengths largely ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt . putative gene functions were assigned to these isotigs by comparing them to the ncbi nr database  using the blastx program. among the  <dig>  isotigs,  <dig>   had homologs with ≥ 30% sequence identity in the nr database ,  <dig>   only had blast hits with sequence identities lower than this threshold , and the remaining  <dig>  had no hit in the nr database, suggesting they might be undiscovered genes or s. miltiorrhiza and/or salvia specific genes . by merging isotigs with overlapping sequences and closely related, putative alleles and/or homoeologs, a final total of  <dig>  non-redundant genes were obtained . given that the total length of these genes was  <dig> , <dig> bases, our  <dig> sequencing data represents just over 16-fold coverage of this reference transcriptome.

the transcriptional response of s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures to induction was determined by an rna-seq approach, using cdna libraries generated from non-induced  and  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi cultures using an illumina gaii sequencer, providing  <dig> nt long single-end reads. a total of  <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig>   <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads were obtained from the  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi libraries, respectively. from these, about 72-75% of the reads from each time point were perfect matches to the isotigs from our reference transcriptome , covering  <dig> % of the total nr isotigs . we next determined the expression levels of each gene by calculating reads per kilobase exon model per million mapped reads  values. using an threshold of rpkm expression values ≥  <dig>  we found that about 68% of the genes were expressed in each cdna library . among these, ~ <dig> % were expressed at all time points, and over 50% of these genes had log- <dig> transformed rpkm values greater than  <dig> . using a 2-fold difference in rpkm and a fisher’s exact test p-value of less than  <dig>  as cutoffs,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  genes were identified as differentially expressed  at the  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi time points as compared to their level in the uninduced  control, respectively, representing a total of  <dig>  de genes .

functional analysis of de genes
to investigate the functions of the  <dig>  de genes, we grouped them into three categories according to their relative expression profiles following induction, namely those that were only up-regulated, only down-regulated, and those with inconsistent changes in their expression level, . gene ontology  analysis revealed that go terms related to stress, stimulus, and immune response processes were significantly enriched among the up-regulated de genes  . by contrast, genes related to development and metabolic processes were mostly down-regulated after induction .

to analyze the relationship of de genes with metabolic processes, we used the mapman tool  <cit>  to visualize the distribution of de genes on known metabolic pathways . consistent with the go analysis results , the expression of genes related to central metabolic pathways, such as photosynthesis, lipid and nucleotide metabolism, were repressed after induction . by contrast, many genes involved in terpenoid metabolism were up-regulated.

analysis of terpenoid metabolism
the production of tanshinones in s. miltiorrhiza involves the formation of isoprenoid precursors, as well as diterpenoid biosynthesis more specifically. accordingly, we first inspected the expression of genes from the upstream isoprenoid precursor biosynthetic pathways, namely the cytosolic mva pathway and the plastidial mep pathway, in our rna-seq data. all mva pathway related genes exhibited a significant increase in expression levels at  <dig> hpi, but this was followed by a significant drop at  <dig> hpi, and a return to expression levels only slightly higher than the control  at  <dig> hpi , representing a rapid but transient response to elicitation. on the other hand, most genes in the mep pathway exhibited more gradual, yet significant, increased expression levels, most of which are still increasing at the last  <dig> hpi time point, exhibiting the expected correlation to tanshinone production . the expression profile of these genes was confirmed by qrt-pcr analysis .

terpenoids are sub-divided on the basis of the number of constituent five-carbon isoprenyl units, with the ten-carbon monoterpenoids generally derived from geranyl diphosphate , the fifteen-carbon sesquiterpenoids from farnesyl diphosphate , the twenty-carbon diterpenoids from ggpp, and the thirty-carbon triterpenoids from squalene. in plants, the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenoids and triterpenoids is initiated in the cytoplasm, whereas that of the monoterpenoids and diterpenoids is initiated in plastids. the expression pattern of the fpp synthase  and squalene synthase  in our rna-seq data resembles that of the upstream mva pathway, as does that of a putative sesquiterpene cyclase  also identified among the de genes . intriguingly, expression of the gpp synthase  is not significantly changed during induction, and that of a putative monoterpene cyclase  found among the de genes is actually significantly down-regulated. by contrast, expression of the ggpp synthase  is steadily and very significantly increased throughout the transcriptomic time course, as is that of smcps, with significantly increased levels of smksl observed as well. all of these are more specifically involved in tanshinone biosynthesis , and their expression pattern is consistent with the observed later and sustained production of these diterpenoid natural products .

identification of co-regulated cytochrome p <dig> genes
cytochrome p450s  monooxygenases play a key role in terpenoid biosynthesis, with such activity almost invariably required for further transformation of olefinic intermediates such as miltiradiene, but as yet their roles in tanshinone biosynthesis are not well characterized. the cyps are divided into related families  and more loosely related clans  <cit> , and our rna-seq data revealed  <dig> expressed cyp genes, covering  <dig> clans and  <dig> families . from these,  <dig> were among the de genes, with the transcript levels of  <dig> found to be increased at all time points following induction . the cyp <dig> clan was the most up-regulated group of cyps, with about 40% of the genes from this clan exhibiting increased transcript levels after induction . within this clan, genes from the cyp <dig> and cyp <dig> families accounted for more than half of those up-regulated. this seems to be due, at least in part, to the relatively large size of these families , which is consistent with the family distribution of cyps found in other plants species  <cit> . we hypothesize that transcription of the cyps involved in tanshinone biosynthesis will be co-regulated with that of the already identified enzymatic genes – i.e., by continuously increasing expression after induction , which highlights eight cyp genes. all of these belonged to the cyp <dig> clan , members of which are generally involved in plant natural products biosynthesis  <cit> .

expression profiling of transcription factor family genes
given the transcriptional regulation of plant natural products metabolism described above, identification of the relevant transcription factors  for the observed induction of tanshinone biosynthesis also is of clear interest. by comparison with the tfs from arabidopsis thaliana in planttfdb, we identified a total of  <dig>  expressed tfs from our transcriptome  <cit> . among these,  <dig> tfs belonging to  <dig> families were among the de genes . in general, the  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi samples shared more tf genes with common expression changes than the  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi samples . the differentially expressed tfs were grouped into three categories by the k-means clustering method. this revealed that there were  <dig> tfs whose expression was consistently down-regulated,  <dig> tfs that were consistently up-regulated, and  <dig> genes with inconsistent changes in expression . many of the down-regulated tfs were related to plant development regulation, such as the basic/helix-loop-helix  and homeodomain-leucine zipper  family genes. by contrast, most of the up-related tfs were related to stress response, as exemplified by the heat shock factors and some wrky family genes .

it has previously been shown that application of the plant defense signaling molecule methyl jasmonate  increases tanshinone production in hairy root cultures  <cit> . however, the relevance of this to the elicitation method utilized here was uncertain. transcription of the jasmonic acid carboxyl methyltransferase , which directly produces meja  <cit> , was strongly increased during induction. in particular, while jmt transcripts were not detected in the control  culture, its transcript reached an expression level of over  <dig> rpkm at  <dig> hpi , suggesting that elicitation may enhance endogenous meja biosynthesis via induction of jmt. moreover, it has been shown that the downstream response to meja is mediated, at least in part, by tf from the erf family, whose own transcription is inducible by meja – e.g., aterf <dig> in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , and orca <dig> in catharanthus roseus, which is involved in activating the terpenoid indole alkaloid  biosynthesis pathway  <cit> . notably, examination of our differentially expressed tfs revealed an aterf <dig> and orca <dig> homolog, smerf <dig>  whose expression is significantly increased during induction .

discussion
s. miltiorrhiza, also known as danshen, is an important traditional chinese medicinal herb whose intensely red rhizome has been used to treat heart diseases for millennia, and extracts of which are currently in clinical trials  <cit> . the characteristic pigmentation is imparted by the tanshinones, a group of abietane-type norditerpenoids with various pharmaceutical activities  <cit> . despite extensive efforts tanshinones remain only poorly accessible via synthesis and their supply is, thus, limited by the natural variation inherent in agricultural production. while this restriction might be alleviated by knowledge of the underlying biosynthetic pathway , little is known about tanshinone biosynthesis. progress has been retarded, in part, by the limited sequence information available for s. miltiorrhiza, as well as some means to associate particular genes with tanshinone biosynthesis. here we have taken advantage of the inducible nature of tanshinone production in hairy root cultures to take a combined metabolomic and transcriptomic approach towards alleviating both issues.

we first carried out metabolomic analysis of hairy root culture exudates harvested either before  or at various times following induction. pca demonstrated that the first component, accounting for almost 80% of the observed differences, was correlated with metabolites appearing at later  time points . notably, the metabolites most correlated with the first component are tanshinones, whose levels are strongly elevated at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi, although increases can be seen as early as  <dig> hpi .

to provide more complete sequence information, we turned to deep sequencing – i.e., transcriptomics. with the expectation that transcription precedes production, we concentrated our sequencing efforts on earlier time points in the induction process . a reference transcriptome consisting of  <dig>  non-redundant genes was obtained from a pooled cdna library using the longer read  <dig> technology, while an rna-seq approach using illumina technology was used to analyze the change in this transcriptome during elicitation . mapping the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes  onto general metabolism revealed a global pattern consisting of down-regulation of central metabolism, along with up-regulation of terpenoid biosynthesis .

closer examination of the expression of genes from terpenoid metabolism demonstrated a striking biphasic response. first, an early, but transient, up-regulation of genes from the cytosolic mva isoprenoid precursor pathway, along with genes involved in the sesqui- and tri- terpenoid metabolism also found in the cytosol. this is followed by a more gradual, but sustained, up-regulation of genes from the plastidial mep isoprenoid precursor pathway. such transcriptional up-regulation of the isoprenoid precursor pathways, which is likely to increase flux to terpenoid natural products  <cit> , has been previously observed – e.g., in rice, although there only the mep pathway was reported to be up-regulated by elicitation  <cit> . thus, the bi-phasic response of the mva and mep pathways observed here may be specific to elicitation of s. miltiorrhiza hairy root cultures.

in any case, the gradual sustained induction of the plastidial mep pathway seems to be relevant to tanshinone biosynthesis, as genes from the monoterpenoid metabolism also found in the plastids are down-regulated, while the few genes already identified in tanshinone biosynthesis  clearly exhibit the same sustained increase in transcript levels . on this basis, we have further identified eight cyp whose similar transcriptional pattern suggests a potential role in tanshinone biosynthesis . finally, we also mined our rna-seq data to identify transcriptional factors potentially involved in eliciting tanshinone biosynthesis, as well as further suggest a role for the defense signaling molecule methyl jasmonate in the induction process .

CONCLUSIONS
the combined metabolomics and transcriptomic approach utilized here has provided some insight into the observed inducible nature of tanshinone production in hairy root cultures of s. miltiorrhiza. for example, highlighting a potential role for the induced, methyl jasmonate-responsive transcription factor smerf <dig> in regulating such elicitation. perhaps more critically, our combined metabolomics and transcriptomics data has revealed a distinct expression pattern correlated with tanshinone production, which provides a firm foundation for further investigation of the biosynthesis of these medically important natural products.
