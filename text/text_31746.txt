BACKGROUND
chemokines are a family of small chemoattrative peptides that were originally recognized to be involved in host defense as regulators of leukocyte trafficking, but more recently have also been shown to have roles in organogenesis, hematopoiesis, and neuronal communication  <cit> . their cognate receptors belong to the class a subfamily of g-protein coupled receptor superfamily  <cit> . chemokines are believed to have originated from gene duplications and these genes underwent selection during recent evolutionary time  <cit> . all chemokines have a characteristic cysteine motif. similarly, chemokine receptors may also be derived from a common ancestor through gene duplications. all chemokine receptors share high homology with the prototypical family member, rhodopsin  <cit> .

chemokines are highly basic proteins,  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids long. sequence identity among chemokines is usually low; however, all share a typical overall tertiary structure, which consists of at least four cysteines that form two disulfide bonds. chemokines are divided into two major  and two minor  subfamilies based on their four conserved cysteines. the first two cysteines in the two major subfamilies are either adjacent  or separated by one amino acid . the first two cysteines in the cx3c chemokines are separated by three amino acids, whereas the xc chemokines contain only two of the cysteines  <cit> . the cc chemokines can be further divided into two subcategories, mcps  and mips  based on their structural similarities  <cit> . the members of these two cc subcategories specifically attract mononuclear cells but not neutrophils. the cxc chemokines can also be divided into two subfamilies, one with an elr  motif, which is angiogenic and attracts neutrophils, and the other without the elr motif, whose members do not attract neutrophils  <cit> .

chemokine genes are characterized by their chromosomal locations and similar gene structure. most human cc and cxc genes are organized in gene clusters in mammalian genomes, such as human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  and mouse chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . the genes encoding the cc subfamily contain three exons, whereas the cxc chemokine genes contain four exons  <cit> . the xc subfamily of chemokines contains two members in human but only one in mouse. cx3cl <dig> is the only known member of the cx3c subfamily in human, mouse, rat, and monkey. there are extensive conserved syntenies in the chromosomal regions containing chemokine genes between human and mouse.

unlike chemokines, chemokine receptors share a higher degree of sequence identity within a species and between species. these receptors have characteristic seven alpha-helix transmembrane domains with a length between 340â€“ <dig> amino acids and have up to 80% amino acid identity  <cit> . they also share an acidic amino terminus, a conserved sequence in the second intracellular loop, and one cysteine in each extracellular domain  <cit> . most receptors can bind several chemokines of a single class with high affinity  <cit> . like chemokines, most chemokine receptors are also clustered in a few chromosomal regions, such as human chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . most amino acid sequences of chemokine receptors are encoded in one exon.

at present,  <dig> chemokine genes have been identified in human  and  <dig>  in mouse, whereas there are  <dig> receptors for ccls,  <dig> for cxcls,  <dig> for cx3cl, and  <dig> for xcl in human and mouse. only  <dig> chicken chemokines including  <dig> cxc,  <dig> cc, and  <dig> xc and seven chicken chemokine receptors including  <dig> cxcr and  <dig> ccr have been reported in the literature  <cit> . chicken chemokines share low sequence identity with mammals  <cit> . therefore, it was very difficult to assign chicken chemokines to a specific mammalian counterpart based on sequence data alone. because of limited sequence similarity, most of the reported chicken chemokines were not named in accordance with the systematic nomenclature of mammalian chemokines. the newly available chicken draft genome sequence and a large number ests allow systematic identification and annotation of chicken chemokine and cognate receptor genes. the objectives of this study were to systematically identify chemokine and chemokine receptor genes in the chicken genome, to name these genes according to existing systematic nomenclature, and to make ligand-receptor binding inferences based on comparative sequence analysis. the systematic nomenclature for these chicken genes was based on the phylogenetic trees and syntenies of chicken, human, and mouse genes, and ligand-receptor binding inferences were according to  <cit>  and  <cit> .

RESULTS
chicken chemokines and chemokine receptors
in addition to the  <dig> previously reported,  <dig> new chicken chemokine were identified. these include  <dig> new cc chemokines named ccl1l <dig> , ccl3l <dig> , ccl/mcp-l <dig> , ccl/mcp-l <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , and ccl <dig> ,  <dig> new chicken cxc chemokines named cxcl13a , cxcl13b , and cxcl13c , cxcl <dig> , and  <dig> cx3cl <dig> chemokine . eleven reported chicken genes were also named accordingly as ccl1l <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl4l <dig> , ccl/mcp-l <dig> , ccl <dig> , ccl <dig> , cxcl8a , cxcl8b , cxcl <dig> , cxcl <dig> , and xcl <dig> . in summary, there are  <dig> ccl,  <dig> cxcl,  <dig> cx3cl, and  <dig> xcl genes identified in the chicken genome. the information used for the nomenclature is shown in the comparative genomic maps and phylogenetic trees.

chicken chemokine amino acid sequence alignment shows that all chicken cc chemokines have four conserved cysteines with two adjacent cysteines at the n-terminus , whereas all chicken cxc chemokines have the conserved four cysteines with the first two cysteines separated by one amino acid . both chicken ccls and cxcls show higher degrees of sequence similarity to each other in the signal peptide sequences and sequence regions containing the last two cysteines. chicken cxcl8a, cxcl8b, and newly identified chemokine cxcl <dig> contain the elr  motif. only one chicken cx3c chemokine was found . the number of amino acid residues between conserved cysteines in all chemokines is highly conserved between chicken and human .

 <dig> cxcl <dig> is not found in humans.

chicken chemokines have limited amino acid sequence similarity compared to their human counterparts. generally, chicken cxc chemokines share  <dig> to 60% amino acid identity with their human homologs except for cxcl <dig>  which share 73% identity with human cxcl <dig>  the length of chicken chemokine cxcl polypeptides ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. compared to their human homologs, chicken cxcl chemokine amino acid sequences are shorter except for chicken cxcl8a, cxcl8b, and cxcl <dig>  which are  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> amino acids longer than their respective human homologs. in contrast, the sequence identities between human and chicken ccl chemokines are generally lower than those for cxcl chemokines, ranging from  <dig> to 56%. chicken chemokine ccl polypeptides have  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. chicken ccl1l <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> have the same amino acid length as their human counterparts. chicken ccl4l <dig> is shorter than corresponding human ccl <dig>  whereas chicken ccl1l <dig>  ccl3l <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig> are longer than the corresponding human ccls. these differences in length between human and chicken chemokines are mostly in the n- and c- termini.

chicken cx3cl <dig> encodes  <dig> amino acids, longer than all mammalian cx3cl <dig> examined. it shares  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 22% amino acid identity with human, mouse, rat, and monkey cx3cl <dig>  respectively. sixty-six amino acid residues in chicken cx3cl <dig> are identical to residues in mammals, but the sequence identity between mammals is, as expected, much higher than that between chickens and mammals . there are more identical amino acids between chicken and mammals at both ends of the sequences.

unlike the chemokines, all the chicken chemokine receptor genes were aligned with non-chicken chemokine receptor reference genes in the chicken genome browser. there was at least one chicken est sequence aligned to each receptor gene except for ccr <dig>  in addition to  <dig> reported receptors,  <dig> new chicken chemokine receptors were identified and named as ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , ccr <dig> , ccr8a , cxcr <dig> , cxcr <dig> , cx3cr <dig> . in contrast to chicken chemokines, chicken chemokine receptors share significant amino acid identity with their human receptor counterparts. the percents of amino acid identity between chicken and human chemokine receptors range from  <dig> to 81%. the lengths of these chicken receptors range from  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids. the complete sequence of chicken cxcr <dig> is unknown due to a sequence gap in the chicken genome sequence. the cxcr <dig> est and a partial genome sequence contain the last  <dig> amino acids of the c-terminus.

fourty-four amino acid residues were highly conservated  among all chicken chemokine receptors . these receptors all have seven transmembrane helices and three extracellular loops. of the seven transmembrane helices, helix  <dig> and  <dig> show higher degrees of sequence similarity than the other helices. the similarity between the extracellular domains of the chicken receptors is lower, but all have a conserved cysteine residue. in contrast, the intracellular domains  generally have higher degrees of sequence similarity than the extracellular domains. the second intracellular domains contain a highly conserved drylaiv sequence.

chromosomal locations and syntenies
comparisons of the chromosomal segments containing chemokines in the human, mouse, and chicken indicate that the organization of the chemokine genes was generally conserved between chickens and mammals . chicken cc and cxc chemokines are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and z. like human and mouse, there are two large clusters in the chicken genome, located on chromosome  <dig> and containing  <dig> ccl genes. two ccl1-like  and three chicken mcp-like  genes related to human and mouse mcps, such as ccl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  are in one cluster , and ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  ccl3l <dig>  and ccl4l <dig> genes in another cluster . another ccl cluster is located on chromosome z containing two genes, ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> . two cxcl gene clusters are located on chromosome  <dig> and contained  <dig> genes, two cxcl <dig>  and one cxcl <dig> genes in one cluster  and three cxcl <dig>  genes in another . chicken shares the syntenies with mouse and human in all these regions. there is one composite cluster containing one cx3cl <dig> and one ccl <dig> genes . synteny was conserved in chicken on one side of this cluster. chicken ccl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  cxcl <dig>  and xcl <dig> are individually located on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, and the syntenies were highly conserved between chicken, mouse, and human in these four locations. mammalian ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> were not found in the chicken genome, although the syntenies associated with ccl <dig> and ccl <dig> were also conserved in chickens. a number of human chemokines including ccl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  cxcl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in chemokine clusters that share syntenies with chicken clusters on chromosome  <dig>  and  <dig> were not found in the chicken genome, indicating gene duplications in mammals.

chemokine receptor genes were also highly conserved between chicken, human, and mouse, and were similarly clustered. the largest cluster of chicken chemokine receptors was found on chromosome  <dig>  where  <dig> receptor genes  were identified. another cluster on chromosome  <dig> contains ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  and cx3cr <dig> genes. chicken cxcr <dig> and cxcr <dig> are also clustered as in mammals, but the chromosomal segment is unknown. the remaining ccr and cxcr genes are individually located on chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> . several human chemokine receptors, such as ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  and cxcr <dig> were not found in the chicken genome, though the syntenies associated with these receptors are present in the chicken genome.

gene structure
according to the chicken genome sequence, chicken chemokine genes share typical three-exon cc and four-exon cxc gene structures with mammals except for cxcl13a and cxcl13b, which have only three exons. chicken chemokine genes are shorter than the corresponding human genes due to shorter introns in chickens. the gene structure of chemokine receptors was also conserved between chicken and mammals. the est sequences indicate that chicken chemokine receptor genes could have up to  <dig> exons, though the complete sequences were not available. however, the expressed sequences show that the amino acid sequences of identified chicken receptors are mostly encoded in a single exon as are most of the mammalian chemokine receptors. chicken ests aligned with the chicken genome sequence indicate that these receptor mrnas have approximately  <dig> kb of 5' utr, as do those found in humans.

phylogenetic analyses and nomenclatures
the phylogenetic trees  show that chicken ccl <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> and all seven cxcls are closely related to single specific human and/or mouse chemokines. the phylogenetic trees together with the syntenies associated with these genes  strongly indicate that these genes are the orthologs of those found in mammals; therefore, they are named accordingly. the phylogenetic results show that chickens have two cxcl <dig> and three cxcl <dig> genes , indicating gene duplications of these genes in aves. one chicken cxcl related to mouse cxcl <dig> but not to human ccls is named as ccxcl <dig>  which is also supported by the synteny of the chemokine cluster . chicken ccl <dig> is named according to relatedness to the human and mouse and the highly conserved synteny . according to the phylogenetic tree in figure 7b, two directly linked chicken ccls are remotely related to human and mouse ccl <dig>  the synteny associated with these genes also indicates that they may be ccl1-like genes ; therefore, they are named as ccl1l <dig> and ccl1l <dig>  three closely related chicken ccls that are directly linked to the ccl1-like genes are related to a group of clustered human and mouse mcp ccls  in the phylogenetic tree. the synteny and phylogenetic tree do not provide information to a specific mammalian ortholog, though these three chicken genes are somewhat more similar to human ccl <dig> and mouse ccl <dig>  the results indicate that these genes are chicken mcp-like ; therefore, they are named as ccl/mcp-like . a chicken ccl gene that is directly linked to ccl <dig> and ccl <dig>  is distantly related to chicken ccl <dig> in the tree. this gene has been reported as mip-1Î²-like chemokine  <cit> , which is ccl <dig> in humans and mouse. therefore, it is named as ccl4l <dig> in order to conform to the report. another ccl in this cluster that does not display relatedness to other ccls in the phylogenetic tree  is named as ccl3l <dig> because this chemokine displays highest sequence similarity to a human ccl3-like chemokine, and it shares synteny with human ccl <dig> genes . overall, cxcls are more conservative among chicken, human, and mouse than ccls.

chicken chemokine receptors can also be named according to mammalian nomenclature based on phylogenetic analysis  and syntenies. the genetic distances appear to be shorter between chicken and mammalian chemokine receptors than those between chicken and mammalian chemokines, which probably due to highly conserved transmembrane domains in these receptors. chicken ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  ccr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cxcr <dig>  cx3cr <dig>  and xcr <dig> are closely related to a mammalian ortholog based on the phylogenetic analysis. there are two distantly related  ccr <dig> genes in chickens. the one closer to human ccr <dig> is named as ccr8a and the other as ccr8b. there are also two chicken ccrs closely related to human and mouse ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  but the phylogenetic analysis could not distinguish them as either ccr <dig> or ccr <dig>  because these two receptors are located in a conserved chromosomal region on chicken, human, and mouse chromosomes, these two chicken ccrs were named as ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> based on the synteny in which ccr <dig> is closer to xcr <dig> than ccr <dig> 

in summary,  <dig> chemokine and  <dig> chemokine receptor genes were identified from the chicken genome in this study. many chicken genes display high degrees of similarity with their human and mouse orthologs in terms of gene structure, sequence homology, and synteny. chicken has significantly fewer ccls, cxcls, ccrs, and cxcrs than mammals, but it has the same number of cx3c, xc, and cognate receptors as mouse. the results of phylogenetic analyses generally agree with the comparative chromosomal locations and syntenies of the genes. the independent nomenclature of chicken chemokines and chemokine receptors suggests that the chicken may have ligand-receptor pairings similar to mammals. the organization of these genes suggests that there were a substantial number of these genes present before divergence between aves and mammals and more gene duplications of cc, cxc, ccr, and cxcr subfamilies in mammals than in aves after the divergence.

discussion
we systematically searched for chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor genes in the recently available draft chicken genome sequence. without this information, it may have taken years to find chicken chemokines and their receptors. the independent nomenclature of chicken chemokines and chemokine receptors and mammalian chemokine-receptor binding information suggest that most of the genes have been identified. one exception was ccl <dig>  the only known ligand of ccr <dig> in mammals, which was not found in this study though its receptor was identified. likewise, cxcl <dig>  and cxcl <dig> were identified in both chickens and mice, but their receptors are unknown; therefore, it is very likely that there are additional chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor genes in the chicken genome.

although most of the systematic nomenclature of the chicken genes was unambiguous based on both phylogenetic trees and syntenies, the information that was used to name seven chicken ccls as ccl1l <dig>  ccl1l <dig>  ccl3l <dig>  ccl4l <dig>  ccl/mcp-l <dig>  ccl/mcp-l <dig>  and ccl/mcp-l <dig> and to distinguish two chicken chemokine receptors into ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> is inadequate. ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> are closely related and tightly linked in the human, mouse, and chicken genomes. the phylogenetic analysis indicates these genes were duplicated after the divergence between mammals and aves. chicken ccl/mcp-l <dig>  -l <dig>  and -l <dig> were related to a group of clustered mouse and human mcp ccls; therefore, specific cognate receptors must be tested to distinguish them. in humans, the chemokines of this mcp group and mips, such as ccl <dig>  ccl <dig>  and ccl <dig>  can bind to more than one receptor, such as ccr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and/or  <dig>  but not both ccr <dig> and ccr <dig>  ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> were not found in the chicken genome and probably are not present in the species. therefore, chicken ccr <dig> and ccr <dig> may be two receptors that recognize these two groups of ccl chemokines, such as ccr <dig> for mcps and ccr <dig> for mips. interestingly, two ccl <dig> like  and two ccl <dig> receptor  genes were found in the chicken genome. the ligand-receptor binding for these four genes can not be determined in this study. nerveless, the names assigned based on comparative analysis in this study may prove useful in order to apply the functional and physiological knowledge from other species to chickens. further lab testing must be carried out to confirm the ligand-receptor binding and to understand their biological functions.

chicken chemokine ests are highly represented in the est database. there are several ests aligned to each identified chicken chemokine gene in the ucsc genome browser. the sequences assembled from ests probably contained most, if not all, of the full-length chemokine mrna sequences. promoter sequences with a typical tataa were detected with promoter prediction software . however, there were only a few ests that partially cover chicken chemokine receptor genes. some of these est contain translation start sites. these est sequences and reported complete coding sequences indicate that the amino acid sequences of chicken chemokine receptors are mostly encoded in one exon. the predicted amino acid sequences were of the expected length and aligned very well with the coding sequences of non-chicken reference genes in the ucsc genome browser. the conserved gene structure of this receptor family and high sequence similarity between chicken and mammals suggest that the predicted coding sequences were very accurate, especially for those with ests containing translation start sites. ccr <dig> is the only predicted gene that does not have a matching est and cxcr <dig> is the only identified gene with partial sequence. further study including sequencing expressed sequences is needed to confirm these genes.

CONCLUSIONS
based on the organization, syntenies, and phylogenetic trees of chicken, mouse, and human chemokine and chemokine receptor genes, we conclude that there may be a substantial number of chemokine and cognate receptor genes before divergence between aves and mammals. the presence of a few chicken chemokine and chemokine receptor paralogs and orthologs of the mammalian genes indicated that most chicken chemokine and the receptor genes shared common ancestors with the human and mouse genes. there were significantly more gene duplications of cc, cxc, ccr, and cxcr subfamilies in mammals than in aves after the divergence of mammals and aves. the mammalian and chicken genome sequences and the genes identified in this study can be used for further investigation of the molecular evolution of these gene families and as a model for the study of the divergence between aves and mammals. avian and mammalian species may share similar chemokine-receptor binding patterns. the results of this study may be used as functional inferences for these chicken genes before they are experimentally tested.
