BACKGROUND
genetic evidence has suggested that the dmrt <dig> gene is an important regulator of male development in vertebrates. in humans, haploinsufficiency of the genomic region that includes dmrt <dig> and its paralogs dmrt <dig> and dmrt <dig> leads to xy male to female sex reversal  <cit> . in chicken and other avian species dmrt <dig> is located on the z chromosome, but absent from w, making it an excellent candidate for the male sex-determining gene of birds  <cit> . in the fish medaka , which has xy-xx sex determination, a duplicated copy of dmrt <dig>  designated dmrt1by or dmy, on the y-chromosome was shown to be the master regulator of male development  <cit> , similar to sry in mammals.

while all other known genes of the sex determination/sex differentiation cascade from mammals appear to be conserved only in vertebrates, and sry even only in the placental mammals and marsupials, dmrt <dig> is exceptional, because it is a true homologue of the drosophila doublesex  and caenorhabditis elegans male abnormal  genes. both dsx and mab- <dig> are components of the genetic cascade that regulates sexual development. they encode transcription factors that control the expression of genes involved in the realization of the male or female phenotype. on the protein level they share a novel dna binding motif, the doublesex and mab- <dig> homology  domain that has been characterized as an intertwined zn-finger  <cit> . the dm domain is also predicted for the proteins encoded by the vertebrate dmrt genes.

both the mab- <dig> and dsx encoded proteins bind to similar dna regulatory sequences of the control region of yolk protein genes and control their transcription  <cit> . both regulate also the differentiation of sex-specific sense organs  <cit> . dsx controls the sex-specific expression of fibroblast growth factor, the dachshund and the bric-a-brac genes, thereby regulating development of genital structures and male-specific pigmentation. furthermore, dsx modulates the response of cells of the genital disc to wingless and decapentaplegic signalling and in this respect regulates sex-specific growth and cell migration .

contrary to the situation in invertebrates, where much progress in the analysis of the biochemical function of doublesex and mab- <dig> as well as the cellular developmental biological effects has been made, such detailed information is still lacking for the vertebrate homologue. so far it is only known that in fish, frogs, turtles, alligators and chicken dmrt <dig> shows sexually dimorphic expression: it is expressed at higher levels in gonads that develop towards testes prior to sexual differentiation and continues to be active in adult male gonads, while it is downregulated in ovaries  <cit> . in mice dmrt <dig> expression in the gonadal primordium is gradually lost in females, but is strongly upregulated during testes development and remains high in the adult organ  <cit> . mutant male mice that lack dmrt <dig> have multiple defects in postnatal testes development and are sterile  <cit> . on the cellular level the specific expression in sertoli cells has attributed to dmrt <dig> a function for these cells in the adult testes, while the expression in male germ cells in some studies remained enigmatic.

we have used the medaka to study the biochemical and cell biological function of dmrt <dig> proteins. this small aquarium fish is comparable in its advantageous features for gene function analysis to the zebrafish. in addition, the duplicated version of dmrt <dig>  the dmrt1by gene, is the male determining gene in this species, being the only known master sex regulator besides sry so far in vertebrates. dmrt1by is expressed in the pre-sertoli cells of the developing testes  <cit> , consistent with its predicted function to determine development of the testes from the undifferentiated gonad primordium. in adult males, the gene is co-expressed with its autosomal progenitor dmrt <dig> in sertoli cells  <cit>  which itself is not expressed at the time of gonad differentiation. beside these differences in expression  <cit>  there are also some differences in structure  <cit> . although displaying a high identity at the amino acid level , phylogenetic analyzes have suggested that single amino acid changes could be largely responsible for the establishment of dmrt1by as the male sex-determination gene in medaka  <cit> .

interestingly, at the time of expression of dmrt1by in the male gonad proimordium shortly before hatching, at stage  <dig>  in both sexes pgcs migrate to the gonadal primordium where they actively proliferate in female but not in males  <cit> . as the number of pgcs at hatching roughly correlated with the inferred level of dmrt1by expression the hypothesis was put forward that dmrt1by may regulate pgc number  <cit> . the mechanisms how dmrt1by might exert this function in unknown. also, the the fact that the transcription factor dmrt1by, expressed in sertoli cells, could act on pgcs has not been addressed. here we show, using overexpression and downregulation by antisense morpholinos that dmrt1by is a negative regulator of cell proliferation that is involved in the male specific cessation of primordial germ cell proliferation prior to testes differentiation in medaka.

RESULTS
dmrt1by modifies cell cycle progression
considering that the first difference seen in medaka gonad development is a difference in pgc number due to propagation of pgcs in females but not in males we investigated whether dmrt1by plays a role in regulating cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. to analyze this, first mouse sertoli tm <dig>  <cit>  were transiently transfected with a dmrt1by:gfp expression construct under control of the cmv promoter . gfp transfected cells were used as controls . after 28– <dig> hours, tm <dig> cells transiently expressing the dmrt1by:gfp fusion protein  exhibited a clear increase of cells in g <dig> phase  and dmrt1by-transfected cells , the proportion of cells in s phase remained constant , the increased number of cells in g <dig> phase was always balanced by a reduction of the proportion of cells in g <dig> phase  . interestingly, also the gfp negative  cells from the cultures transfected with dmrt1by, showed reduced but similar g <dig> enrichment as the dmrt1by expressing gfp positive cells  . cells treated with serum conditioned by cells overexpressing dmrt1by did not display any change in cell cycle phase distribution . similar experiments in fish a <dig> cells revealed the same result .

taken together, these data suggest that dmrt1by affects cell proliferation by arresting cells in g <dig> phase through both a cell autonomous and a juxtacrine mechanism.

dmrt1by inhibits cell propagation in early medaka embryos
to confirm the inhibition of cell proliferation by dmrt1by observed in cell culture in an in-vivo situation capped mrnas encoding fusion proteins of gfp with wild type dmrt1by  or a version lacking the dna binding dm domain  were injected into embryos at the one cell stage . gfp rna-injected control embryos showed exclusive cytoplasmic fluorescence . dmrt1by-gfp fluorescence instead was observed preferentially in the nucleus . this shows that the dmrt1by fusion protein was correctly translated and then properly imported into the nucleus. surprisingly, although mutational analysis demonstrated the presence of a nuclear localization signal  in the dm domain of the zebrafish dmrt2/terra protein  <cit> , our experiments show both cytoplasmic and nuclear accumulation of the Δdmrt1by:gfp fusion protein, which lacks the entire dm domain . this points to an additional nuclear targeting mechanism for dmrt1by outside of the dm domain.

to monitor for a possible proliferation effect, cell cleavages were followed from the  <dig> cell stage  until shortly after mid-blastula transition , around stage  <dig>  dmrt1by:gfp mrna was injected at concentrations ranging from  <dig> ng/μl to  <dig> ng/μl. doses below  <dig> ng/μl had no effect, while intermediate  and high doses  led to cessation of development at 90% epiboly/neurula stage and shortly after mbt  respectively. intermediate doses  induced developmental delay during early development around the mbt stage . in embryos injected with high doses of dmrt1by:gfp, once arrested shortly after mbt , blastula cells remained quiescent for 6– <dig> hours and then disintegrated . for Δdmrt1by:gfp neither intermediate nor high doses had any effects on embryo cell proliferation indicating that the dmrt1by effect on early embryo cells is mediated by the putative dna binding domain.

for cell cycle analysis, medaka embryos were injected with either low doses  or high doses  and analyzed at stage  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. for both stages flow cytometry revealed a dramatic dose dependant increase of cells accumulated in g <dig> phase upon dmrt1by expression  that is balanced by a reduction of the proportion of cells in s phase. this in vivo result  corroborates the cell culture data .

dmrt1by arrests cell proliferation modulates dna replication and can lead to apoptosis
to examine whether the inhibitory effect of dmrt1by affects cell proliferation or causes cell death, one cell stage embryos injected with high dose  were allowed to develop until they stopped their development at stage 10– <dig> . at that stage apoptotic pathways usually become active  <cit> . injected embryos were stained for the mitotic marker phospho-histone h <dig>   as well as by tunel assay for apoptosis . high dmrt1by:gfp doses led to an almost complete arrest of cell proliferation. only  <dig> to 20% of the cells were positive for ph <dig>  compared to controls, which displayed  <dig> to 80% proliferating cells . embryos injected with intermediate doses of dmrt1by:gfp  that are able to pass through the mbt stage, were allowed to develop until late neurula  and analysed the same way. cell replication status was lower than in controls . analysis of apoptosis by tunel labelling revealed a statistically significant increase of apoptotic cells at the neurula stage  . most of these apoptotic cells were not in the embryo but were located at its periphery or spread all over the yolk sac . in summary, dmrt1by effects were clearly dose-dependent and ranged from slowing-down cell proliferation rates and delay in development up to complete replication stop.

transgenic fish expressing dmrt1by show a delay in early development
as mrna injection experiments can produce excessively high levels of a gene product in a transient way, we sought for a system that leads to more physiological levels of dmrt1by in early embryonic cells not interfering with normal development. a transgenic line expressing the dmrt1by:gfp fusion protein driven by the ubiquitously active cytoskeletal actin promoter was established and analysed for dmrt1by:gfp expression . this transgenic line, however, does not show sex reversal, probably due to the ubiquitous rather than sertoli-cell specific expression and generally low expression in later developmental stages of the dmrt1by transgene.

in embryos of the transgenic line, after zygotic transcription starts at mid-blastula , a ubiquitous accumulation of the fusion protein was observed. during early neurulation  gfp intensity reached its maximum. interestingly this wave of dmrt1by:gfp protein expression was clearly paralleled by a marked delay in development for which the peak is also at early neurulation  . at the maximal dmrt1by:gfp protein accumulation at 70–80% epiboly , cell replication status was quantified using ph <dig> staining . while the spatial distribution of ph <dig> staining was comparable for both, wild type and transgenic embryos, a highly significant  decrease of  <dig> % in the number of replicating cells was observed for the dmrt1by:gfp protein expressing embryos . this value in the transgenics  is similar to the value obtained in-vitro in dmrt1by expressing cell lines .

differences in primordial germ cell number, shape and replication pattern are diagnostic for the male and female gonad anlage
evidence has accumulated that the first appearance of morphological sex differentiation in medaka is a difference in the number of germ cells between the sexes  <cit> . importantly, dmrt1by expression in the male gonad correlates with the appearance of male/female germ cell dimorphism. this first morphological sex difference is apparent as early as pre-hatching stage   <cit> , more than ten days before the somatic gonad is formed  <cit> . hence, taking advantage of the olvas medaka transgenic line  <cit> , which expresses gfp under control of the vasa promoter specifically in the primordial germ cells, we investigated the possibility of sexing medaka embryos as early as the hatching stage through primordial germ cell number and shape .

just after hatching , gfp-positive pgc number in olvas males was one half up to two third of olvas females  . this is in accordance with the findings of kobayashi et al.  <cit>  and hano et al.  <cit> . an additional criterion for discrimination was the shape of the area occupied by the pgcs. this materializes as a large ovoid cumulus-like cloud shape for females ; while being thinner and more stretched  along the anteroposterior axis for males . noticeably, at stage  <dig>  both sexes present a significant higher number of pgcs in the right pgc lateral clump, although this is more pronounced in females   <cit> . furthermore, individual primordial germ cells appear round and compact in males, while being smaller and more "diffuse" in females. altogether these criteria allowed predicting sex of olvas fish already shortly after hatching with a reliability of  <dig> %  . in addition, at stage  <dig> , brdu incorporation assay revealed more replicating cells in female than in male . noticeably, this enhanced cell replication in female was observed for both pgcs and the somatic surrounding cells .

in order to test whether the morphology of the developing gonad in olvas transgenic fish correlates with expression of a functional dmrt1by gene, the yawr mutant strain was used. in this strain dmrt1by contains a nucleotide insertion in exon  <dig>  resulting in a frame shift creating a premature stop at residue  <dig>  although this mutation is connected to a male to female sex reversal in xyawr and yawryawr fish  <cit> , the underlying mechanism is unknown and sex-specific germ cell numbers and arrangement was not reported. offspring obtained by mating a yawryawr female with an olvas xyhdrr male  containing the wild type dmrt1by gene was analyzed according to the above mentioned criteria in order to determine sex by pgc and primordial gonad phenotypes. presence of dmrt1byawr and/or dmrt1byhdrr alleles was then assayed by pcr using specific oligonucleotide primers . this revealed that the pgc phenotype, like in wild type fish, is determined by the presence  or absence  of a functional dmrt1byhdrr gene  .

down-regulation of dmrt1by shifts male primordial gonad phenotype towards female
to this end the dmrt1by effect on cell proliferation could be demonstrated in-vitro as well as in-vivo. however, to verify that this function is of relevance for the gene's action in gonad determination and development we attempted to down-regulate dmrt1by expression in developing embryos. having the possibility of discriminating male and female primordial gonads by gfp phenotypes and brdu incorporation at hatching stage, embryos were injected with a dmrt1by-morpholino at the one cell stage and analyzed for gonad phenotype and genotype at hatching  .

in no case genotypic females were affected. in genotypic males , dmrt1by morpholino injection resulted in mainly three phenotypes . complete primordial germ cell phenotypic sex reversion was observed for  <dig> % of the males . another  <dig> % of the males exhibited an intermediate male/female pgc and gonad shape but made up of much more primordial germ cells when compared to wild type males . the remaining  <dig> % males showed no gross abnormalities . in injected embryos that were allowed to develop until adult stage, no sex reversion of the gonad was observed.

it should be noted that the effect of dmrt1by morpholino knockdown occurred exactly at the stage when dmrt1by is first expressed in the pre-sertoli cells and when the first difference in the presumptive male and female primordial gonad become visible. brdu incorporation showed that in female and male-dmrt1by morpholino injected gonads, many pgcs were labelled  while in genotypically male control embryos a lower number of brdu labelled cells were observed . the ratio between male and female brdu-labelled gonadal cells was  <dig>  –  <dig>  in non injected fishes. in fish injected with dmrt1by morpholino this ratio increased to  <dig>  –  <dig> , indicative of higher proliferation rate. similar results were obtained when checking at cell replication using phospho-histone h <dig> staining . interestingly, in female and male-dmrt1by morpholino injected embryos, the higher number of labelled pgcs was paralleled with a higher replication status of the surrounding gonad mesoderm .

discussion
from nematodes to mammals, evidence has accumulated that dmrt <dig> genes are involved in sex determination  <cit> . however, nothing is known how these genes exert their function during gonad induction, differentiation and maintenance in vertebrates. considering the fact that in medaka like in many other fish  <cit>  the first sign of sexual differentiation is a lower number of pgcs in male embryos has led to the obvious hypothesis that dmrt1by regulates pgc numbers at the hatching stage in males . a lower number of pgcs in the gonad primordium of males could be due to a negative control of proliferation at one of the various check points of the cell cycle, reduction of pgcs by apoptosis or phagocytosis, or loss of pgcs through migration out of the gonad primordium. our results support the view that medaka dmrt1by negatively regulates cell proliferation through an arrest in the g <dig> phase. graded ectopic expression of dmrt1by correlated with the degree of down-regulation of cell proliferation, up to complete arrest. apoptosis appeared to be a late consequence of dmrt1by toxicity. however, the molecular mechanisms by which medaka dmrt1by exerts its effect remain to be determined.

dmrt1by effects on cell proliferation in embryos were only observed, when zygotic transcription had already started after mbt. combined with the apparent nuclear localization this opens the possibility that dmrt1by may be involved in regulation of genes that control cell proliferation. however, dmrt <dig> transcriptional activity has not been demonstrated in vertebrates yet, but has been established for the drosophila doublesex and c. elegans mab- <dig> orthologues of dmrt <dig>  <cit> .

medaka dmrt1by is exclusively expressed in pre-sertoli cells of the male primordial gonad at hatching stage as well as in adult testes in mature sertoli cells  <cit> . thus, it is possible that one early function of dmrt1by is to negatively regulate cell proliferation in the sertoli cell lineage. this would be responsible for sertoli cell quiescence, which is a hallmark of this cell type. such hypothesis is supported by the only other functional study on a dmrt <dig> orthologue from vertebrates: in dmrt1-/- mutant mice sertoli cells show an abundant overproliferation  <cit> .

beside an obvious cell autonomous effect on the cell cycle, also a non-cell autonomous, possibly juxtacrine action was observed. this juxtacrine action correlates with the observations of shinomiya  <cit>  showing that in medaka in xx/xy transplantation chimeras, xy somatic cells differentiate into male cells according to their sex chromosome composition and that in this environment xx germ cells differentiate into male cells.

we have shown that already  <dig> days before somatic gonadal dimorphism, sex can be diagnosed through both primordial germ cell phenotype and somatic gonad replication rate just after hatching in live embryos. at this stage the number of primordial germ cells is higher in xx embryos than that of xy embryos  <cit> . dmrt1by has been shown to be exclusively expressed in the pgc supporting pre-sertoli cells  <cit> . hence, during primordial gonad formation, dmrt1by primary function could be to regulate both supporting cell replication and primordial germ cell proliferation via a non-cell autonomous mechanism. we have shown here that dmrt1by can act in a juxtacrine way to downregulate proliferation and that dmrt1by-morpholino injection led to modulation of the early "primordial gonad" phenotype, transiently shifting male primordial germ/supporting cell phenotype towards the female state. the transient nature of the shift from male to female pgc phenotype at hatching stage after dmrt1by morpholino injection is due to the limited stability of the morpholino and clearly indicates that dmrt1by action during male primordial gonad commitment is not strictly inductive but requires a prolonged expression.

in medaka it has been demonstrated that xy supporting somatic cells can initiate sex differentiation into the male type regardless of the presence of coexisting germ cells  <cit> . in addition, cell transplantations between blastula embryos in medaka suggest that xy somatic cells produce an environment that leads to the differentiation of primordial germ cells into male germ cells regardless of their sex chromosome composition  <cit> . in this context, two main functions can be concomitantly attributed to the master sex determining dmrt1by gene in testis development in medaka. first, because from embryo to adult, continuous dmrt1by expression occurs specifically in the sertoli cell lineage  <cit>  and cell autonomous differentiation of sertoli cell differentiation has been observed in xy gonads lacking germ cells  <cit> , dmrt1by is likely to induce the development and the maintenance of the sertoli cell lineage in an autocrine manner like its mammalian counterpart sry. second, dmrt1by appears to be responsible for the male primordial germ cell arrest from the pre-hatching stage  until 20– <dig> days after hatching, likely via a juxtacrine mechanism.

CONCLUSIONS
the finding that dmrt1by downregulates primordial germ cell proliferation already  <dig> days before somatic gonadal differentiation, leads us to suggest that in xy medaka males, dmrt1by driven pgc number regulation as well as determination of pre-sertoli cells is the primary event by which the whole gonad  would be specified through a directional cross talk from pre-sertoli/sertoli cells with pgcs. then, at this stage, sertoli cells would be inhibiting primordial germ cell proliferation in the male primordial gonad through juxtacrine dmrt1by action.
