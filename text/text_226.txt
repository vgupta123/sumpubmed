BACKGROUND
evolutionary changes frequently involve modifications to gene regulatory programs. several lines of evidence indicate the importance of transcriptional regulation in evolution. first, comparative studies have shown that cis-acting regulatory elements that are binding sites for regulatory transcription factors evolve rapidly  <cit> . second, the proportion of genes encoding transcription factors is higher in genomes encoding larger proteomes consistent with the disproportionately higher regulatory requirements of more complex organisms  <cit> , for example, the nematode caenorhabditis elegans has about  <dig> genes encoding homeobox transcription factors  <cit>  compared to  <dig> such genes in yeast   <cit> , while the total proteome in the nematode is less than 4-fold larger than that in yeast. third, several yeast species whose common ancestor has undergone whole genome duplication have preferentially maintained paralogous pairs of transcription factors during the re-haploidisation process that ensued, suggesting that transcription factors have a higher than average evolutionary potential  <cit> . finally, it has been suggested that non-coding rna, which is much more abundant in complex organisms with large genomes, plays important roles in regulating the transcription levels of genes  <cit> . more recently it has been suggested that protein interactions between transcription factors and co-regulator proteins they recruit to target genes may also be important for evolutionary potential  <cit> . thus, evolutionary changes in the interactions of transcription factors with dna binding sites and the co-regulators they recruit would predict that the involvement of co-regulator proteins in different regulatory pathways should be evolutionarily diverged.

gcn <dig> is a phylogenetically conserved transcriptional co-regulator that is found throughout the eukaryotes. gcn <dig> was the first transcriptional co-regulator protein shown to contain a histone acetyltransferase  activity  <cit>  and it is the catalytic subunit of several related hat complexes, notably the saga complex  <cit> . these complexes acetylate lysine residues in chromatin, primarily within the n-terminus of histone h <dig>  <cit> . the subunit composition of the saga complex is highly conserved across the large evolutionary distance between s. cerevisiae and s. pombe  <cit> . the saga complex is a direct target for recruitment by transcriptional activators in vitro  <cit>  and in vivo  <cit>  and is physically associated to a greater or lesser extent with the promoter and/or transcribed regions of many expressed genes in s. cerevisiae  <cit>  and s. pombe  <cit> . the hat domain is the most highly conserved part of gcn <dig> and it has been shown to be inter-changeable between humans and yeast  <cit> . gcn <dig> is thus structurally conserved throughout evolution and appears to function in a conserved fashion by acetylating a conserved set of lysine residues in target proteins. interestingly, gcn <dig> has also been reported to be important for regulation of stress-response genes in budding and fission yeasts  <cit> , suggesting that some physiological roles of gcn <dig> may also have been conserved but this has not been studied systematically.

yeasts offer a powerful system for comparative studies because highly divergent organisms can be cultured and manipulated under comparable environmental conditions  <cit> . our previous studies show a specific role of fission yeast gcn <dig> in programming a subset of stress response genes in s. pombe  <cit> . to further understand functional and evolutionary aspects of gcn <dig>  we here study the equivalent stress responses in the evolutionarily diverged budding yeasts s. cerevisiae and s. kluyveri. we show that gcn <dig> is required for a common set of stress responses in the budding and fission yeasts. we further report results from a genome-wide study of gcn5's role in the kcl stress response in s. cerevisiae that is comparable to our previous studies in s. pombe. the results reveal interesting novel insights with regard to the function of gcn <dig> in s. cerevisiae and show that it regulates a different set of stress genes compared to those identified in s. pombe. further, we show that gcn <dig> is located throughout the transcribed regions of many s. cerevisiae genes as has also been shown for s. pombe  <cit> , but that there are also mechanistic differences in gcn <dig> action between the two species. the study provides an interesting view of the interface between aspects of a transcriptional regulator that are highly conserved and their functionally divergent applications in evolutionarily distant species.

RESULTS
gcn <dig> is required for several common stress responses in divergent yeast species
to compare the physiological roles of gcn <dig> over a large evolutionary interval, we chose to compare the phenotype of gcn5Δ mutants in s. cerevisiae and its distant budding yeast relative s. kluyveri, using a range of environmental stress conditions, including several conditions where gcn <dig> dependence has previously been demonstrated in s. pombe  <cit> . first, we replaced the gcn <dig> gene from wild type s. kluyveri with a standard kan-mx cassette as described in the materials and methods. fig. 1a shows the result of testing the phenotypes of gcn5Δ mutants of the three yeast species under different environmental-stress conditions. gcn5Δ mutants in s. pombe are not distinguishable from wild type cells on rich medium as shown previously  <cit> , but they show a mild growth deficiency in s. cerevisiae and s. kluyveri. we observed that gcn <dig> was required in s. cerevisiae and s. kluyveri for adaptation to stresses mediated by kcl and cacl <dig> as previously observed in s. pombe  <cit> . gcn <dig> is also required in all three species for other stress conditions, such as calcoflour white, mncl <dig> and caffeine. these common stress sensitivity phenotypes suggest a specific phenotypically conserved role for gcn <dig> because gcn <dig> dependence is not universally observed in the three different species for a range of other stress conditions. these conditions include licl, mgcl <dig>  nacl and sorbitol for which none of the yeasts require gcn <dig> for stress adaptation. also for ethanol, elevated temperature and sds, gcn <dig> appears to be differentially important in the different yeast species . quantitative analysis of all measured colony size differences is shown in additional file  <dig>  the conserved stress conditions thus provide ideal models for studying divergence and evolvability of gene regulation in evolutionarily distant organisms. to facilitate comparison of gcn5's role in the conserved stress responses of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, it was necessary to further characterize the stress response role of gcn <dig> in s. cerevisiae.

defects in the conserved hat activity of gcn <dig> cause stress sensitivity
the hat domain of gcn <dig> is the most conserved domain with a sequence homology of 67% between budding yeast and human  <cit> . to test whether gcn <dig> hat activity is important for the stress response we tested the ability of plasmids expressing wild type or mutant gcn <dig> alleles, containing triple alanine substitutions, to rescue the salt sensitivity of gcn5Δ. the gcn5-kql and gcn5-pkm substitution mutants have previously been shown to abolish hat activity, while the gcn5-pke mutant maintains full catalytic activity  <cit> . the relative location of the mutated amino acid residues in the gcn <dig> hat domain is indicated in fig. 1b. expression of wild type gcn <dig> and gcn5-pke restores wild type growth levels during kcl and cacl <dig> stress while strains expressing the gcn5-pkm and gcn5-kql proteins with defective hat activity display the same level of stress sensitivity as gcn5Δ . we conclude that the conserved hat activity of gcn <dig> is required for its role in stress responses.

identification of kcl stress response genes
to study how gcn <dig> is involved in the kcl stress response of s. cerevisiae, we first identified genes with changed expression levels during kcl adaptation in wild type cells. fig. 2a shows that many genes show either increased or decreased expression in response to kcl . the gene ontology terms most significantly associated with the sets of kcl-induced and repressed genes are shown in table  <dig>  the response to kcl-stress conditions is complex but appears to include down-regulation of some general cellular functions  as well as induced expression of genes involved in stress adaptation . down regulation of genes involved in protein synthesis during the response of s. cerevisiae to other stress conditions has been reported previously  <cit> . more than 30% of genes regulated during kcl adaptation are general environmental stress response genes  <cit>  . we found a similar proportion of common stress response genes among the kcl stress response genes of s. pombe, as described previously  <cit> . we also found similar gene ontology categories for kcl-induced genes in both yeast species, such as response to stress/stimuli, oxidoreductase activity and carbohydrate metabolic process.

identification of gcn <dig> dependent kcl stress response genes
next, we investigated the role of gcn <dig> in the kcl stress response of s. cerevisiae. comparison of the expression profiles for gcn5Δ cells in relation to wild type in the absence and presence of kcl showed that a significant number of genes become more dependent on gcn <dig> under kcl stress conditions, as shown by the broader distribution of gcn5-dependent effects in the presence of kcl . interestingly, there is a fairly equal distribution between genes that require gcn <dig> for expression, consistent with its role as a coactivator, and genes that are directly or indirectly repressed by gcn <dig>  to define a group of gcn <dig> dependent kcl responsive genes, we selected a group of  <dig> genes as summarised in fig. 3b. briefly, the group of  <dig> genes contains kcl-induced genes that show reduced expression in the gcn5Δ mutant during kcl stress  as well as kcl-repressed genes that show increased expression in gcn5Δ during kcl stress . the gene ontology categories most significantly associated with gcn <dig> dependant kcl response genes  include categories that would be expected to play an important role during adaptation to kcl stress conditions, such as ion homeostasis.

characterization of direct gcn <dig> target genes
we validated several gcn5-dependent kcl response genes by semi-quantitative pcr . this group includes a membrane transporter vmr <dig>  and a heat-shock-response gene ssa <dig> . the latter is consistent with a recent report that gcn <dig> and elp <dig> induced histone h <dig> acetylation is important for regulating hsp <dig> expression  <cit> . interestingly, we also confirmed that the flo <dig> gene, which encodes a transcriptional regulator, is up-regulated in gcn5Δ . this is typical of many gcn <dig> dependent genes and its dependence on gcn <dig> for its stress-regulated repression is of interest because gcn <dig> is generally regarded as a transcriptional activator. one possibility is that up-regulation of flo <dig> in gcn5Δ could be an indirect effect of the gcn <dig> defect. to identify direct targets of gcn <dig> we performed chip-on-chip experiments to identify the genome-wide localisation of myc-tagged gcn <dig> using high resolution tiling arrays under the kcl stress conditions in which gcn <dig> is required for flo <dig> expression. this analysis showed reproducible interaction of gcn <dig> with the flo <dig> transcribed region under kcl stress conditions, suggesting direct repression of flo <dig> expression by gcn <dig> . direct association of gcn <dig> with flo <dig> was further confirmed by semi-quantitative pcr , the antibody used for precipitation of gcn5-myc is specific because no signals were detected either in the absence of antibody or in a strain lacking the specific epitope tag in the presence of antibody . we conclude that gcn <dig> functions as a negative regulator for flo <dig> under kcl stress conditions. a repressive role of the gcn5-containing saga complex has been reported previously. in s. cerevisiae, gcn <dig> is required for repression of arg <dig> on rich media where expression is not required but the role of gcn <dig> switches on minimal media, where it is required for induction of arg <dig>  <cit> . a similar function of gcn <dig> and the saga complex has been reported in s. pombe, in which gcn <dig> represses ste <dig> and mei <dig>  while another saga subunit, spt <dig> is required for their activation under inducing conditions  <cit> .

as expected, we observed enriched association of gcn5-myc on many gcn5-dependent genes. however, there are other gcn5-dependent genes for which we do not observe enrichment of gcn <dig>  the detection of transcription factor genes, such as flo <dig>  among the direct gcn <dig> targets suggests that many of the indirect target genes might be regulated by such transcription factors. this is true for flo <dig>  where  <dig> of  <dig> flo <dig> target genes identified previously  <cit>  are dependent on gcn <dig> in our study. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated in the absence of flo <dig>  in gcn5Δ cells, where flo <dig> is up-regulated, these genes show the opposite regulatory patterns as would be expected if their gcn <dig> dependence is an indirect consequence of defects in the direct regulation of flo <dig> by gcn <dig> .

changes in the pattern of gcn <dig> localization under stress conditions
to analyse the genome-wide pattern of gcn <dig> localisation as well as whether the localisation pattern changes upon kcl stress, we analysed the distribution of gcn <dig> within genes in the absence and presence of kcl using average gene analysis. in this method, data for each gene is mapped onto a hypothetical gene of average length, thus allowing studies of average gcn <dig> distribution across a model gene for different groups of genes. first we examined the average localisation of gcn <dig> in sets of genes that are either up-regulated, down-regulated or unchanged in cells lacking gcn <dig> . in the absence of kcl, gcn <dig> tends to be most abundant at or close to the promoter region . this is consistent with previous data showing that gcn <dig> is localised predominately to promoter regions  <cit>  as well as the known pattern of histone acetylation within genes  <cit> . in the presence of kcl, the average localisation of gcn <dig> is predominantly within the transcribed region of genes . the changed average distribution of gcn <dig> to transcribed regions during kcl stress conditions suggests a role of gcn <dig> in the transcribed regions of genes under these conditions. such a role has been suggested for gcn <dig> on the gal <dig> gene where it appears to play a transcription-coupled role in nucleosome eviction in the transcribed region  <cit>  during induction of the gene by galactose. recently we showed that gcn <dig> plays an important role in transcriptional elongation in s. pombe  <cit> . it is thus possible that an elongation-related role of gcn <dig> may be conserved throughout the eukaryotes.

in s. pombe, gcn <dig> tends to be preferentially located within the transcribed regions of highly expressed genes in the absence of stress  <cit> . to test whether this is so in s. cerevisiae we used average gene analysis to test the distribution of gcn <dig> in sets of genes containing genes expressed at different levels . in the absence of stress gcn <dig> tends to be preferentially localised to highly expressed genes but it is not preferentially located in the transcribed region. however, during kcl stress the average localisation of gcn <dig> is in the transcribed region but its preference for highly expressed genes under these conditions is marginal and may not be significant.

it was reported previously  <cit>  that a very long coding region expressed from the gal <dig> promoter was more sensitive to defects in gcn <dig> than the normal gal <dig> gene, which has a shorter coding region. in particular, the level of rna polymerase ii at the 3'-end of the long-gene coding region was sensitive to defects in gcn <dig>  this suggests that gcn <dig> might be particularly important for transcription of long genes in s. cerevisiae. to investigate this at the genome-wide level we used average gene analysis to study the distribution of gcn <dig> on gene sets containing genes of different length, both in the absence and presence of kcl stress . in the absence of stress  the level of gcn <dig> at transcribed regions is inversely related to their length. this pattern is completely changed upon kcl stress, where there is a clear positive correlation between the levels of gcn <dig> in the transcribed regions and gene length .

the changes in the average distribution of gcn <dig> upon kcl stress could be due to a shift in the location of gcn <dig> on individual genes or it could result from enhanced or depleted levels of gcn <dig> on specific classes of genes that together make up the observed average localisation patterns. to distinguish between these possibilities, we used k-means clustering to identify the most clearly defined gene sets according to their average gcn <dig> localisation pattern . interestingly, we identified five gene clusters for which the average gcn <dig> localisation pattern was representative of the majority of individual genes within the cluster . comparison of the average gcn <dig> localisation for these clusters in the absence and presence of kcl showed differences that can account for the overall changes in average gcn <dig> localisation. notably, cluster  <dig>  containing genes for which gcn <dig> tends to be located in the transcribed region, shows enhanced gcn <dig> association in response to stress. furthermore, cluster  <dig>  containing genes with an even distribution of gcn <dig> throughout the gene, shows a strong reduction in the average level of gcn <dig> association. the changes in these two clusters are the main reasons for the apparent shift of gcn <dig> to transcribed regions during stress. the remaining clusters show smaller changes in the average gcn <dig> localisation pattern but the subtle changes that do occur also tend to specifically enhance the level of average gcn <dig> association with transcribed regions. strikingly, cluster  <dig> is significantly enriched in long genes ; it contains  <dig> genes that are longer than  <dig> bp, representing about half of all the genes within this length category. cluster  <dig> is significantly enriched in short genes  and includes  <dig> genes shorter than  <dig> bp. thus, adaptation to kcl stress is associated with a net transfer of gcn <dig> from short genes, where it tends to be evenly distributed throughout genes, to long genes, in which it is predominantly localised within the transcribed region. fig.  <dig> shows the re-distribution of gcn <dig> on individual genes chosen from clusters  <dig> and  <dig> in response to kcl mediated stress. the gcn <dig> redistribution between different genes thus accounts for the changes in average gcn <dig> localisation shown in fig. 5c.

comparative analysis of gene regulation by gcn <dig> during stress adaptation
since gene regulatory networks evolve rapidly , we did not expect gcn <dig> to be involved in evolutionarily conserved functional applications even though it is a highly conserved protein at the structural and mechanistic levels. it was therefore of interest that gcn <dig> plays a role in adaptation to a common set of stress responses in evolutionarily divergent yeasts . to determine whether cross-species conservation is also seen at the level of gcn <dig> target genes, we identified a set of gcn5-dependent kcl response genes in s. pombe  in previously published microarray data  <cit> , using the same criteria as for s. cerevisiae data in this work. gene ontology analysis showed that several functional categories are enriched in gcn <dig> dependent kcl response genes in both yeasts . to compare whether orthologous pairs of genes are involved in gcn <dig> dependent adaptation to kcl stress in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe, we used unambiguous orthologous relationships that have been predicted for  <dig> pairs of genes  <cit> , which is about half of all s. cerevisiae genes. comparison of the  <dig> gcn <dig> dependent kcl responsive genes in s. cerevisiae with the equivalent group of  <dig> genes identified in s. pombe revealed only  <dig> cases where both s. cerevisiae and s. pombe genes were members of an orthologous group, with the same regulation pattern . the extent of the overlap is at a level that would be expected by chance and may thus not be statistically significant. the two orthologous pairs are ydl171c-spab1e <dig> , encoding a glutamate synthase, which has a function in detoxification, and ydr223w-spac22h <dig> c, encoding a transcriptional corepressor, involved in the regulation of ribosomal protein gene transcription. it was formally possible that the kcl response could be so diverged between the two yeast species at the gene level, that there would be few or no co-regulated orthologous gene pairs that are potential targets for gcn <dig>  however, this appears not to be the case since there are many orthologous gene pairs that are regulated similarly in response to kcl stress in both s. cerevisiae and s. pombe . we conclude that gcn <dig> regulates divergent sets of kcl responsive genes in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe.

finally, we wanted to find out if there is a similar change in the distribution pattern of gcn <dig> when cells are subjected to stress conditions in the two yeasts. to allow comparison with the s. cerevisiae chip-on-chip data described above we performed analogous chip-on-chip experiments to determine the localisation of gcn5-myc in s. pombe during kcl stress adaptation. equivalent data in the absence of stress have been published recently  <cit> . we selected groups of genes from s. cerevisiae and s. pombe that showed a level of gcn <dig> enhancement greater than  <dig> -fold  in both the absence and presence of kcl. the localisation pattern in s. cerevisiae differs between the two conditions consistent with the results in fig.  <dig> , while the pattern for gcn5-myc in s. pombe is similar under both conditions . the different behaviour of s. cerevisiae and s. pombe suggests that there are differences in the redistribution behaviour of gcn <dig> between the two yeasts.

the results published here provide new insights regarding the role of coregulator proteins such as gcn <dig> during physiological adaptation in the budding yeast, s. cerevisiae. the results also provide insights about how the enzymatically conserved gcn <dig> protein is utilized divergently in evolutionarily divergent organisms. although gcn <dig> plays a role in a set of stress responses that seems to be conserved across the large evolutionary distance between budding and fission yeasts, we find that gcn <dig> is important for the expression of divergent sets of genes during adaptation to at least one of these stress conditions. this finding is consistent with existing findings that support the highly evolvable nature of gene regulation networks . the divergent requirement for gcn <dig> might thus be due to altered recruitment to target genes as a result of changes in the position or composition of transcription factor binding sites or changes in the repertoire of protein interaction partners available to transcription factor proteins. a recent comparative study provides a similar example between much more closely related species, s. cerevisiae and candida glabrata  <cit> . the gene expression responses to oxidative stress are remarkably conserved between these two species, but the underlying regulatory networks differ. each species appears to have different response motifs and the oxidative stress response transcription factor  show clear differences in the way they "read" the cis-regulatory elements present in target promoters. other examples of transcription networks, such as the regulation of s-phase related transcription in budding and fission yeasts by the mbf/sbf transcription factors, show a high level of evolutionary conservation between transcription factors and their target genes  <cit> .

gcn <dig> is a structurally and mechanistically conserved protein that functions by acetylating other proteins, notably histone h <dig>  in a specific manner via its hat domain or by specifically binding to acetylated histone h3-k <dig> residues via its bromo domain. as mentioned above the difference in the identity of gcn5-dependent stress genes in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe is most likely a result of divergence in the genes to which gcn <dig> is recruited in different yeasts, since gene regulation networks are known to evolve rapidly. over the evolutionary distance separating s. cerevisiae and s. pombe we would not expect to find any conservation of biological function for the gcn <dig> protein. it is thus interesting to consider why gcn <dig> function is required for a common set of stress responses in the different yeast species studied here. one possibility is that the evolution of gcn <dig> function is constrained by some aspect of its function, other than the target genes it regulates. for example, gcn <dig>  or perhaps other proteins in the saga complex, could be regulated by evolutionarily conserved stress-specific signaling pathways that modulate gcn <dig> activity. this mechanism would require some stress genes to be gcn <dig> dependent but the identity of such genes could be different in different yeasts. interestingly, there are known examples in which coregulators are direct targets for signaling pathways  <cit> . it is also possible that loss of gcn <dig> recruitment to stress genes during evolution often creates growth defects during stress that tend to be suppressed by acquisition of gcn <dig> recruitment by other genes involved in the same stress response, as a result of natural selection.

the results provide new insights into the mechanistic role played by gcn <dig> during stress adaptation, which appear to show both similarities and differences between s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. we provide further support for the direct role of gcn <dig> as a repressor of many genes as has been suggested previously for both s. cerevisiae and s. pombe . the re-distribution of gcn <dig> between genes during stress adaptation appears to be more dynamic in s. cerevisiae than in s. pombe, where the average gcn <dig> localisation profiles are similar in the absence and presence of stress. the gene cluster  showing enhanced association of gcn <dig> in the transcribed region during stress adaptation contains about one third of all the genes.  <dig> of these genes are regulated during kcl adaptation and  <dig> are dependent on gcn <dig>  these gene sets are significantly enriched in long genes . therefore, the enhanced gcn <dig> binding during kcl adaptation can account for some of the observed regulatory changes and gcn <dig> may have a role in transcribed gene regions that is specific for long genes. the role of gcn <dig> in transcribed regions is associated with the efficiency of transcriptional elongation in s. pombe. this may also be the case in s. cerevisiae but further studies are required to test this. gcn <dig> has been shown to be important for eviction of nucleosomes from the transcribed region of the gal <dig> gene  <cit> , which would be consistent with an elongation role in s. cerevisiae.

CONCLUSIONS
gcn <dig> is an evolutionarily conserved protein that is required for a common set of stress responses across a highly divergent range of yeast species. these responses require the activity of the conserved hat domain but are mediated by divergent sets of gcn <dig> dependent response genes in s. cerevisiae and s. pombe. gcn <dig> is localised to s. cerevisiae genes that require its activity for their repression as well as for activation, thus providing support for the suggestion that gcn <dig> can function as a direct repressor of gene activity in addition to its characterized role as a transcriptional coactivator. gcn <dig> localisation tends to shift from short genes to the transcribed regions of long genes during stress adaptation in s. cerevisiae. no such change is detectable in s. pombe. in the absence of stress gcn <dig> is preferentially localised on highly expressed genes in s. cerevisiae, as previously reported for s. pombe.
