BACKGROUND
whereas the coding sequences constitute only  <dig> % of human genome, the noncoding constituent of the genome has recently come into light as functionally important. the most well studied part of noncoding transcriptome is represented by micrornas , which affect expression of protein coding genes by modulating mrna stability and translation. mirnas regulate various biological processes and have well established roles in cancer  <cit> . however, long noncoding rnas  represent the largest fraction of transcriptional output in the mammalian genome. unlike extensively studied protein coding transcripts or mirnas, the majority of lncrnas still remain "the dark matter of the genome" with their functionality being debatable. several lncrnas have been shown in recent years to be directly involved in oncogenesis  <cit> . reprogramming of chromatin state mediated by lncrna hotair is linked to metastasis and poor prognosis in breast cancer  <cit> . malat- <dig> has originally been shown to be associated with metastasis in lung carcinomas  <cit>  and regulate invasive potential of tumor cells  <cit> .

significant fraction of lncrnas is represented on widely used microarray platforms, however they have traditionally been ignored in cancer studies. thousands of microarray datasets accumulated over years in public databases provide an immense resource for analysis of lncrna expression. in this study we set an example of reanalysis of this rich data source by annotating the noncoding probe sets of the popular affymetrix u <dig> microarray and applied this annotation to identify lncrnas associated with aggressive and nonaggressive types of neuroblastoma .

nb is a common pediatric malignancy characterized by tremendous clinical heterogeneity, in which some tumors are extremely aggressive and drug resistant while others can spontaneously differentiate into benign forms and are sensitive to differentiation stimuli  <cit> . according to international nb staging system , based on tumor characteristics and age, nb is classified into  <dig> localized stages , advanced locoregional  and metastatic   <cit> . about one-half of nb patients have metastatic disease at diagnosis.

one of the most widely used prognostic genomic markers is amplification of mycn locus, which occurs in 20% of nb cases. it is associated with poor survival and is considered a promising therapeutic target in nb  <cit> . all metastatic tumors with amplified mycn gene are aggressive, whereas tumors with non-amplified mycn gene have variable clinical behavior that could be driven by clinical  and biological factors .

a large number of clinical genomics and experimental model studies have described protein- coding gene expression profiles that can differentiate nbs with favorable and unfavorable outcomes  <cit> . the protein-coding gene signatures of nb aggressiveness are characterized by over-expression of genes involved in myc and Î²-catenin pathways, cell cycle

and chromosome segregation, and on the other hand by low expression of genes involved in neural differentiation  <cit> . unfortunately, reliability and consistency between the gene signatures reported in these and other publications are very poor . it suggests high plasticity of gene expression patterns in nb tumors, a large number of correlations between potential biomarkers and high dimensionality of their space. due to poor understanding of molecular basis of nb and high disease-caused mortality of the nb patients there is an urgent need for discovery of novel molecular drivers of nb progression and its differentiation, as well as high-confidence and reliable clinical biomarkers specifying nb tumors, prognosis of clinical outcome and improvement of nb patients' therapy.

the degree of nb differentiation correlates with stage of nb and its progression. retinoic acid  is a differentiation agent that is the first choice drug for nb therapy  <cit> . however, in many cases nb acquires resistance to ra treatment thus leading to relapses. much effort has been devoted to identify biological subtypes and critical regulators of ra-induced nb differentiation. ra-induced signalling pathway in nb initiates expression of many hundreds of genes including mycn and other proto-oncogenes  <cit> . it has also been shown to alter drug resistance mechanisms  <cit> . identification of new molecular drivers, as well as unbiased, more complete and clinically relevant mechanisms of ra-induced differentiation of nb is still a great challenge.

gain of chromosome arm 17q is one of the most common genetic abnormalities encountered in nb, which is associated with poor prognosis  <cit> . an example of lncrna biomarker for nb is ncran gene mapped to 17q region  <cit> . its over-expression was shown to be associated with aggressiveness of primary nb  <cit>  and confer a set of oncogenic properties, such as acceleration of cell growth and increasing invasiveness  <cit> . one of the classes of highly conserved lncrnas, known as transcribed ultraconserved regions  has been shown to be implicated in cancer  <cit> . indeed, differential expression of t-ucrs was shown to correlate with such oncogenomic parameters as mycn amplification status and be a consequence of dna copy number changes associated with nb  <cit> . another study revealed association of different sets of t-ucrs with poor and long-term survival in the metastatic stage of nb patients  <cit> . in spite of this evidence for involvement of lncrnas in nb, systematic and unbiased genome-wide analysis has not been performed.

in this study, we performed systematic genome-wide analysis to identify biomarkers for aggressive stages of nb. for these purposes we took advantage of the extensive coverage of a considerable part of noncoding transcriptome by affymetrix u <dig> plus  <dig>  microarray probe sets. these probe sets have traditionally been neglected in most studies aimed to identify tumor biomarkers. here, we developed a computational pipeline to annotate noncoding probe sets on affymetrix u <dig> chips, representing ests, non-annotated rnas, and unknown ncrnas and identified lncrna transcripts that differentiate favorable from aggressive stages of nb, as well as relapsing and non-relapsing primary tumors. we found that one of the identified in this study lncrna transcript, termed hoxd-as <dig>  is induced by ra, regulated by pi3k/akt pathway and controls genes implicated in ra-mediated cell differentiation and also angiogenesis and inflammation, the hallmarks of metastasized cancer  <cit> .

RESULTS
affymetrix u <dig> series microarrays contain  <dig>  probe sets measuring expression of potential lncrnas, including  <dig> high-confidence lncrna transcripts
the probe sets of affymetrix u <dig> chips were designed to detect not only transcripts of protein-coding genes, but also many transcripts currently annotated as ests and non-annotated rnas, some of them can measure expression of unknown lncrnas. our goal was to find such probe sets. the  <dig>  probe sets of affymetrix microarrays u133a, u133b and u133plus- <dig>  were subjected to the filtration by quality and uniqueness of transcript matching according to the criteria of apma database described by us earlier  <cit>  . following the database annotation,  <dig>  probe sets matching unique genomic locations of rnas not annotated as protein mrnas were selected. probe sets overlapping with exons of any known proteins  on the same dna strand were excluded from the analysis. thus,  <dig>  probe sets were selected , each of them matched a single transcript. to ensure that the selected transcripts do not encode proteins, we analyzed them with critica software that identifies protein-coding sequences by potential presence of codons in the transcript sequences  <cit> . all  <dig>  transcripts passed this filter and, therefore, they were considered as probe sets potentially measuring expression of lncrna genes. to find which of these genes can be considered as true lncrna candidates, their length distribution was analyzed. to ensure the reliability of the results, the sequences of individual affymetrix probe sets were independently scanned against the  <dig>  sequences of lncrna transcripts annotated by gencode consortium  using ncbi blast tool. only  <dig>  transcripts were found to have uniquely matching probe sets,  <dig> of which were present among our  <dig>  ncrna candidates. since there was a limited overlap between the candidates and the gencode-annotated lncrnas, we considered the  <dig> lncrnas as a high-confidence subset embedded in our data.

length distribution of the ncrna candidate transcripts reveals three lncrna classes
traditionally, ncrnas longer than  <dig> nt are considered lncrnas. according to this criterion,  <dig>  selected ncrnas were classified as lncrnas. the distribution of the lncrnas by length can be described as a mixture of three groups . two distributions with very long and moderate long sequence lengths were fitted well with power-law like functions  <cit> . the length distribution of relatively shorter 3-rd group of lncrnas resembles a log-normal distribution whose shape is more similar to the frequency distribution of protein-coding genes . the expected lncrna lengths marking the three ranges correspond to each of the three distributions. they were found from the extrapolation of the components' estimates to their intersection points giving lengths of  <dig> nt and  <dig>  nt. thus, based on these cutoff estimates, we propose the following groups of lncrna genes: 1) lncrnas- <dig>  length from  <dig> nt to  <dig> nt, 2) lncrnas- <dig>  length from  <dig> to  <dig>  nt and 3) lncrnas- <dig>  length > <dig>  nt. these classes comprise approximately 4%, 87% and 9% of  <dig>  selected lncrnas.

genes encoding lncrna- <dig> and lncrna- <dig> classes are localized next to transcription factor genes implicated in development
since the vast majority of the studied lncrnas have never been functionally classified, we analyzed the functions of their neighboring genes . due to their proximity, they may be co-regulated with the lncrna genes and thus may suggest biological processes associated with these genomic regions. for 89%  of lncrnas such neighbors were found. for the classes lncrna- <dig>  lncrna- <dig> and lncrna- <dig> this fraction was 89% , 89%  and 93% , respectively . gene ontology  analysis of all lncrnas showed significant enrichment for  <dig> ontologies, including 'wnt pathway', 'nucleic acids metabolic processes', 'mitochondria' and 'transcription factors' . out of four go terms associated with lncrna- <dig>  three  were common with all lncrnas. in contrast, class lncrna- <dig> was associated with  <dig> go terms common with all lncrnas. 'homeobox transcription factors' and 'gut mesoderm development' categories were absent in lncrna- <dig> class go terms and were unique for lncrna- <dig> class. class lncrna- <dig> was significantly associated with  <dig> go terms, i.e. more than for all lncrnas. go terms 'reproduction', 'embryonic development' and 'krab box transcription factors' were associated only with lncrna- <dig> class. it is remarkable that among the neighbors of lncrna- <dig> class genes 'gut mesoderm development' category was represented by  <dig> genes from  <dig> hox clusters: hoxa, hoxb, and hoxd. these transcription factors constitute 88% of all  <dig> lncrnas annotated with this go term. two other homeobox genes, not belonging to hox were emx <dig> and mnx <dig>  fifteen other transcription factor genes belong to the zinc finger class and the remaining  <dig> genes to other classes.

 <dig> lncrnas are associated with nb progression
data from nb patient tumor samples  were used to make a primary screening of lncrnas associated with nb. fourteen tumors in this dataset were mycn-amplified , while the rest  <dig> tumors had no mycn amplification .  <dig>  lncrnas represented on affymetrix microarray u133plus- <dig>  were analyzed for their association with the stages of nb progression in the non-mna group of patients . after comparing expression levels of these genes in early stage  vs. late stage  tumors  <dig> of them were identified as genes whose expression could discriminate  between the stages. among them  <dig> lncrnas, whose expression levels significantly correlate  with the stage were found . among them 79%  correlated positively. pam analysis revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> lncrnas form a gene signature able to discriminate between the low-aggressive  and high-aggressive  tumors with 79-88% accuracy . this signature also discriminates between relapsing and not relapsing primary tumors  with 74-80% accuracy . the lncrnas of this tumor aggressiveness/relapse gene signature are grouped in two clusters by their correlation coefficients . analysis of go of the genes neighboring the  <dig> lncrnas of the main cluster demonstrated a significant enrichment in genes associated with nucleic acid binding and transcription .

importantly, this list of lncrna candidates included  <dig> genes  whose neighboring protein-coding genes were annotated as involved in embryonic development . studying them could give a clue for the mechanisms of lncrna involvement in neuroblastoma progression. therefore, we tested the expression of each of the  <dig> lncrnas in response to the treatment of neuroblastoma cells to ra. ra is a morphogen, which can induce neuronal differentiation in embryo and cell culture and is widely used for therapy of neuroblastoma.

hoxd-as <dig> is up-regulated by retinoic acid in sh-sy5y neuroblastoma cell line
in our experiments, we chose non-mna neuroblastoma cell line sh-sy5y, which is a widely used model for ra-induced neuronal differentiation. in our recent work, we performed analysis of differential expression of the  <dig> lncrnas upon differentiation of sh-sy5y cells using custom microarray chip  <cit> . among all  <dig> tested lncrnas only one lncrna was upregulated during differentiation  <cit>  was represented among the  <dig> lncrna genes, correlating with nb stage, measured in patient tumors by a probe set 239182_at. using qrt-pcr we measured the expression of these  <dig> lncrnas at four time points  post ra induction. the expression of only one transcript al <dig>  encoded by gene hoxd-as <dig>  was progressively up-regulated by ra up to the highest level at the 5th day after ra-induction . it is located between hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> genes in anti-sense direction to both of them. noncoding status of hoxd-as <dig> was predicted by both megablast and critica algorithms . interestingly, expression level of probe set 239182_at correlates with the progression stage of the nb patients  , including non-mna  patients. it also discriminates the tumors at stages 1- <dig> from the tumors at stages 3- <dig> , including non-mna  and mna  patients .

characterization of hoxd-as <dig> locus and its transcripts
within the locus between hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> genes several isoforms of hoxd-as <dig> have been annotated with two transcription start regions defined by active promoter features, such as cpg islands, h3k <dig> acetylation and transcription factor chip tracks . the probe set 239182_at, which discriminates the patients, at its 5'-end fits into the boundary of refseq transcript nr_ <dig> , which starts at the promoter region  <dig>  in order to define the boundaries of hoxd-as <dig> transcript in sh-sy5y cells, a set of primer pairs targeting different possible exons within this region was designed . treatment of sh-sy5y cells with ra resulted in induction of all regions under query with a 3-5-fold magnitude for most of them, apart from the primer pair  <dig>  querying the first two exons of ucsc loc <dig> isoform starting at the promoter region  <dig>  which was induced only 2-fold . the comparison of the relative levels of different amplicons revealed that the least abundant was ucsc loc <dig> isoform starting at the promoter region  <dig> , pri <dig> - pri <dig> querying regions common for all possible transcripts were of the highest abundance and pri_ <dig> querying exons 1- <dig> of nr_ <dig>  was of comparably high level . the knock-down by two sirnas used in this study as described below  resulted in depletion of regions fitting to the refseq nr_ <dig>   and the ucsc genes loc <dig> isoform starting at promoter region  <dig> , but not the ucsc genes loc <dig> isoform starting at the promoter region  <dig> . in summary, refseq nr_ <dig>  transcript was the most abundant in sh-sy5y cells and the most responsive to experimental conditions of ra-induced differentiation and sirna mediated knock-down. although the probe set 239182_at features the shortened form of the exon  <dig> as compared to hoxd-as <dig> annotated transcripts, the pairs of primers spanning its entire length as in the ucsc geneset  produce comparable relative qrt-pcr signals  and are depleted by both sirnas , implying that the full length of this exon is present in the transcript under query. indeed, the predicted full length size of nr_ <dig>  transcripts of  <dig>  nucleotides is confirmed by northern blot using the probe targeting exon  <dig> .

evolutionary analysis of hoxd-as <dig> gene
a comparison of hoxd-as <dig> gene region against ncbi database of reference genomic sequences with blast showed that more than 96% of this gene sequence is evolutionary conserved among hominids . at the same time, only 12% to 52% of hoxd-as <dig> sequence is shared with other primates , comparable to 11% of dog  and 8-12% of ungulates  . thus, a gap between hoxd-as <dig> genomic sequence in apes and other monkeys is apparent.

tissue expression pattern of hoxd-as <dig> correlates with hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig> genes expression
we characterized the pattern of expression of hoxd-as <dig> in human body by qrt-pcr analysis of human organ cdna panel. we found that hoxd-as <dig> is expressed in multiple tissues with the highest levels of expression in kidney, colon and testes and the lowest in liver, heart, pancreas and stomach . in general, hoxd-as <dig> demonstrated highly correlated expression with its neighboring protein coding genes hoxd <dig> and hoxd <dig>  thus implying that they are subject to the common regulatory mechanism. notably, in the non-mna patient tumors hoxd-as <dig> expression significantly correlated with hoxd <dig>  , but not hoxd <dig> 

differentially expressed genes identified after knock-down of hoxd-as <dig> in sh-sy5y cells
the differential expression of hoxd-as <dig> in nb patients and in differentiating nb cell line is an indicator of functionality of this lncrna. in order to gain more insight into functionality of hoxd-as <dig> we sought to investigate its effect on global gene expression profile in the context of differentiation of sh-sy5y cells. for this purpose we designed two sirnas targeting different regions of hoxd-as <dig>  both of these sirnas knocked down hoxd-as <dig> transcript in the ra-induced sh-sy5y cells with  <dig> - 80% efficiency as compared to non-targeting sirna control . the total rna was hybridized to illuminabeadarray  and differentially expressed genes common for two sirnas were identified. in total, we identified  <dig> differentially regulated genes, among them  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . the pattern of differential expression of a set of genes, most of which were chosen for their involvement in the processes of inflammation and angiogenesis as discussed further, was confirmed by qrt-pcr . in order to annotate the functions of differentially expressed genes at the network level we mapped them on existing networks using metacore pathway analysis software. we observed significant functional enrichment in pathways regulating angiogenesis and inflammatory jak/stat pathway .

expression of genes controlled by hoxd-as <dig> significantly correlates with its expression in clinical neuroblastoma samples
in non-mna tumors we analyzed pair-wise correlation between expression of hoxd-as <dig> and of its targets revealed in the knock-down experiments. among the genes regulated by hoxd-as <dig> in the cell line,  <dig> were represented on the affymetrix chip by  <dig> probe sets. the expression of  <dig> of them significantly  correlated with hoxd-as1expression in the nb samples . sixteen genes correlated positively and  <dig> negatively. expression of  <dig> hoxd-as <dig> targets was significantly different in primary tumors of  <dig> patients with relapse , seven of which at the same time correlated with nb stage . importantly, magea9b gene expression was also a significant  marker of 5-year survival of neuroblastoma patients . additionally, magea9b, along with two other targets of hoxd-as <dig> - tnf and cnr <dig>  were recently found to be a part of neuroblastoma signature identified in several datasets  <cit> . sixteen of hoxd-as <dig> target genes were predictive markers of nb relapse . remarkably,  <dig> out of these  <dig> genes were previously reported to respond to ra treatment . among these genes snn, tmem86a, vipr <dig>  crem were down-regulated and tspan <dig>  cnr <dig>  crebl <dig>  ptgs <dig> were up-regulated by ra. gene signature consisting of four hoxd-as <dig> targets, adamts <dig>  amdmd <dig>  ang, asna <dig> could predict nb relapse with 76-80% accuracy . thus, hoxd-as <dig>  in response to ra treatment, controls expression of genes involved in nb progression. some of them can serve as predictive markers of nb relapse and are associated with patient survival.

hoxd-as <dig> is evenly distributed between nucleus and cytoplasm
so far most of the characterized lncrnas that effect gene expression are known to be localized to the nucleus. therefore, we analyzed the subcellular localization of hoxd-as <dig>  qrt-pcr analysis of subcellular fractions of sh-sy5y cells revealed that hoxd-as <dig> is equally distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm . this pattern was largely confirmed by rna fluorescence in situ hybridization. hoxd-as1-specific probe sets detected individual transcripts both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm .

hoxd-as <dig> expression is regulated by pi3k/akt signaling pathway
induction of differentiation of nb cells by ra is a complex process, requiring involvement of at least two signaling pathways: pi3k/akt and mapk/erk  <cit> . to characterize regulation of expression of hoxd-as <dig> by these signaling pathways we used chemical inhibitors of pi3k , mek <dig>  and p38-mapk . sh-sy5y cells were induced to differentiate in the presence of these inhibitors in the time course of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours and change of hoxd-as <dig> expression was measured by qrt-pcr. the induction of hoxd-as <dig> was significantly reduced in the presence of ly <dig>  however it was not affected by either pd <dig> or sb <dig>  thus indicating that hoxd-as <dig> is regulated by pi3k/akt pathway, but not by mapk/erk .

discussion
evidence for involvement of different lncrnas in oncogenesis and for their potential use as biomarkers of cancer is growing  <cit> . affymetrix u <dig> series are among the most widely used microarray platforms with thousands of datasets deposited in the public databases. given the fact that many lncrnas were fortuitously represented on this platform these datasets provide a great potential for their reanalysis, with lncrnas taken into account. here we annotated the noncoding fraction of affymetrix probe sets and created a resource for this kind of studies.

discrimination of coding and non-coding transcripts is not straightforward, and different laboratories are using different methods. therefore, in our work we used two different methods that discard the possibility of any transcript encoding a protein: megablast, to eliminate the possible known protein homologs; followed by critica to eliminate the possibility that any of our transcripts may encode a protein, yet to be discovered  <cit> . all  <dig>  transcripts studied in our work satisfied both criteria. in addition to that, we applied the criterion of transcript length distribution among proteins to judge about our dataset as a whole. to maximize the reliability of prediction, we performed an additional analysis and mapped the probe sequences to the lncrna transcript sequences predicted by gencode consortium. it allowed us to identify  <dig> reliable probesets corresponding to lncrnas out of  <dig>  initially predicted. we provided classification of these  <dig>  lncrnas by the length of their transcripts and discriminating three classes among the lncrna genes longer than  <dig> nt. our classification system is vindicated by the fact that the proposed lncrna classes have distinct gene ontologies.

however, lncrna prediction strategy utilized in this study does not take into account relative position of candidate lncrna gene in relation to protein coding gene. it has been a prevalent belief for some time that intronic parts of mrnas cannot be considered as lncrnas because they merely represent pre-mrnas on their way to splicing or spliced-out introns on their way to degradation. the lower expression of the intronic regions than those in exons seemingly was consistent with this notion. however, several recent studies have focused on this important issue and concluded that intronic lncrnas have a number of features that would be expected from functional, stand-alone rna species. for example, st laurent et al. have shown that there are thousands of intronic rnas in the mouse genome changing throughout the inflammation time course that are likely to be functional  <cit> . the levels of intronic rnas were independent of those of exons or other introns and some of the introns encoded relatively abundant rna species. another study by tahira et al. described intronic lncrnas differentially expressed in primary and metastatic pancreatic cancer  <cit> . the authors suggested that intronic lncrnas are generated from independent transcriptional units. in support of this notion they have shown enrichment of h3k4me <dig> marks close to the known boundaries for the set of intronic transcripts, the presence of conserved dna elements and stable predicted secondary structures in intronic lncrnas, evidence for the evolutionary selection, and significant enrichment of cage tags proximal to known start sites of intronic lncrnas  <cit> .

applying the new probe set and ncrnas annotation system for biomarker discovery in public datasets, we identified a gene expression signature consisting of  <dig> lncrnas, which can discriminate nb tumors by their aggressiveness and clinical stages. to our knowledge, this is the first example of a gene signature based on expression of lncrnas only. functional studies of lncrnas are not common and the biological effects of this class of molecules have not been studied well. the primary structures of lncrnas are much less conservative in comparison with protein structures. therefore, functional characterization of human lncrnas is particularly difficult. characterization of lncrnas via gene signatures specific to certain diseases reported in the present study can be used as a tool to solve this methodological conundrum. it is important that our syndrome-centered scan for potential candidates was successfully validated and complemented with mechanistic studies on a model cell line. regarding the clinical potential of gene expression signatures based only on lncrnas, it is important to note that such signatures can be particularly useful as diagnostic and prognostic tools in combinations with existing protein-based signatures, since lncrnas and proteins belong to different regulatory realms and thus naturally increase each other's power as patient classifiers.

among the  <dig> lncrnas we selected hoxd-as <dig> for functional characterization as the most potent candidate for playing a role in oncogenesis. the gene encoding hoxd-as <dig> is located in hoxd cluster. hox genes are the key developmental regulators and their aberrant expression is often associated with malignancy  <cit> 
. we obtained evidence of a two-step evolution of the unspliced hoxd-as <dig> sequence. the first step, characterized with initial two-fold increase of hoxd-as <dig> length, presumably occurred around the time of primates branching from other placental animals between  <dig>  <cit>  and  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . the second step, when the maximal-length hoxd-as <dig> gene in hominids  was established, might have occurred 15- <dig> million years ago, when hominid diverged from hylobatids   <cit> .

remarkably, hoxd <dig> gene, adjacent to hoxd-as <dig> locus, has established role in promoting metastatic potential of lung cancer cells  <cit> . hoxd <dig>  which is also adjacent to hoxd-as <dig>  has been linked with locus rs <dig> associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, more significantly for the serous subtype  <cit> . this locus lies in a non-coding region, ~ <dig> kb distal to hoxd <dig> and ~ <dig> kb proximal to hoxd <dig>  <cit> . using higher resolution map, we found that snp rs <dig> is localized in hoxd-as <dig> and includes the last intron and last exon regions boundary.

interestingly, differential expression of hoxd-as <dig> lncrna was detected by microarray analysis in a number of cancer studies. it was among the  <dig> genes up-regulated in egfr-mutated adenocarcinomas, which are characterized by poor post-operative prognosis  <cit> . in breast cancer, over-expression of breast cancer metastasis suppressor gene  leads to down-regulation of hoxd-as <dig>  <cit> , thus further pointing to its potential pro-oncogenic role. in contrast, hoxd-as <dig> was shown to be one of the most drastically down-regulated genes in hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . we also found that hoxd-as <dig> is strongly suppressed in colorectal adenoma discriminating these precancerous lesions from the surround normal mycosa tissue  <cit> . here we show that hoxd-as <dig> is highly induced by ra treatment of nb sh-sy5y cell line. ra causes growth arrest and differentiation of nb cells, therefore it is widely used for therapeutic purpose. the elevation of hoxd-as <dig> levels in metastatic tumors is in a seeming contradiction with its up- regulation during tumor cell differentiation. one possible explanation is that hoxd-as <dig> elevation in metastatic tumors is a compensatory reaction to a loss of its differentiation-promoting function that actually leads to aberrant tumor-promoting effect. this could happen because of the overall loss of homeostasis when inactivation of one pathway leads to a compensatory activation of another pathway.

in this study, we investigate regulation of hoxd-as <dig> expression within a framework of pi3k and mapk signaling pathways, both of which are necessary for ra mediated differentiation and survival of sh-sy5y cells  <cit> . here we demonstrate that chemical inhibitor of pi3k, but not inhibitors of components of mapk pathway mek <dig> and p <dig> significantly reduce ra-mediated induction of hoxd-as <dig> . both pi3k and mapk pathways are induced in sh-sy5y cells by ligation of a family of growth factors, known as neurotrophins to their respective receptors belonging to a class of receptor tyrosine kinases. different types of neurotrophin receptors are known to control differentiation and survival of neuroblastoma cells include trka, trkb, trkc  <cit> . whereas trka and trkc are not regulated, or regulated marginally by ra in sh-sy5y, trkb is efficiently induced by it . interestingly, activation of pi3k pathway by ligation of trkb with its specific ligand bdnf leads to both neuritogenesis and survival. on the other hand, activation of mapk pathway contributes only to neuritogenesis, but not survival  <cit> . indeed, pi3k pathway is known to promote oncogenesis via inhibition of apoptosis as one of the mechanisms  <cit> . both activation of pi3k pathway and over-expression of trkb and bdnf are associated with poor prognosis in nb  <cit> . in contrast, patients with increased levels of trka and trkc demonstrate better prognosis  <cit> . thus our results imply that hoxd-as <dig> may be regulated via pi3k pathway induced by oncogenic bdnf/trkb axis. this is further supported by our observation that hoxd-as <dig> transcript positively correlates with trkb and negatively correlates with trka and trkc .

in agreement with the proposed pro-oncogenic role of hoxd-as <dig>  we observed that its sirna- mediated knock-down resulted in differential expression of genes implicated in angiogenesis and inflammation, two highly interdependent processes considered as the hallmarks of cancer  <cit> . both of these processes are manifested in a crosstalk between tumor cells and their microenvironment that includes endothelial and immune inflammatory cells. in agreement with this, a number of hoxd-as <dig> target genes encode secreted proteins that provide communication between tumor and its microenvironment. among them are cytokines, such as cx3cl <dig>  ccl <dig>  tnf, gdf <dig> - key regulators of angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis ang and prox <dig> - genes involved in remodeling of extracellular matrix lox and adamts <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the computational pipeline developed in this study was successfully applied to greatly extend the number of novel nb cancer biomarkers using published affymetrix u <dig> chip datasets and to identify candidate lncrnas functionally implicated in classification of the nb subtypes. we found that one of these lncrnas, named hoxd-as <dig>  is induced by ra, could be regulated via pi3k/akt pathway, controls genes involved in ra signaling, angiogenesis and inflammation.
