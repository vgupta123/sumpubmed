BACKGROUND
the presence of systemic and locally-produced antibodies in oral fluid has led to its use as a diagnostic specimen for a variety of infectious diseases. in humans, oral fluids have been used in the diagnosis of human immunodeficiency virus , hepatitis a, b, and c viruses, measles, mumps and other infectious diseases  <cit> . in swine, antibodies against a variety of economically significant pathogens have been reported in oral fluids, including classical swine fever virus  <cit> , porcine circovirus type  <dig>  <cit> , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus  <cit> , swine influenza virus  <cit> , transmissible gastroenteritis virus  <cit> , actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae <cit> , and e. coli <cit> . in large measure, the kinetics of the antibody response against individual agents has not been described. therefore, the purpose of present study was to describe and contrast the ontogeny of prrsv igm, iga, and igg in oral fluids and serum specimens collected from individually housed boars during acute prrsv infection.

RESULTS
prrsv antibody isotypes in serum
the prrsv antibody isotype  responses in serum samples are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  estimates for dpi − <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were based on data from  <dig> boars, whereas estimates for dpis  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were based on a subset of  <dig> animals randomly selected from the  <dig> boars. based on pairwise comparisons, statistically significant levels of igm were detected by dpi  <dig>  peaked at dpi  <dig>  and remained stable through dpi  <dig>  in contrast, statistically significant levels of iga and igg were detected by dpi  <dig>  after which they remained stable  or increased significantly  through dpi  <dig>  further analysis showed that igm and iga responses were associated with dpi , trial , and the interaction between trial and dpi . in contrast, dpi  was the only factor associated with the igg response. neither the age of the boar at the time of inoculation nor the quantity of oral fluid collected from each boar had a significant effect on igm, iga, or igg.

prrsv antibody isotype in oral fluid samples
the prrsv antibody isotype  responses in oral fluid samples are shown in figure  <dig> and table  <dig> for oral fluid samples collected on dpi − <dig>  0– <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  estimates were based on ≥ <dig> oral fluid samples at each sampling point. igm s/p ratios were statistically significant on dpi  <dig>  peaked at dpi  <dig>  and declined thereafter. levels of iga and igg were significant on dpi  <dig> and increased thereafter through the end of the experiment . factors significantly associated with igm and iga s/p ratios included trial , dpi , oral fluid volume , and the interaction between trial and dpi . factors associated with igg included dpi  and the interaction of trial by dpi . regardless of isotype, boar age at the time of inoculation had no significant effect on antibody response.

comparison of prrsv antibody responses in serum and oral fluid
a comparison of the qualitative antibody response in serum vs. oral fluid found no significant difference in the proportion of elisa positive results on dpi  <dig> –  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . no significant difference was detected in the number of positive results for each pair-wise sample combination  by trial, dpi, or trial by dpi. on dpi  <dig>  100% of serum and oral fluid samples were positive with mean s/p ratios of  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. an analysis of the quantitative antibody isotype responses in serum and oral fluid samples using test results from samples collected on dpi − <dig>   <dig> –  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> estimated pearson’s correlation coefficient as r =  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for igm, iga, and igg responses, respectively .

a prrs x <dig> ab test  performed according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

b prrs x <dig> ab test  modified to detect anti-prrsv antibody in oral fluid specimens  <cit> .

c samples with s/p ratio ≥  <dig>  were classified as positive.

comparison between viremia levels and antibody responses
all serum samples from dpi − <dig> and  <dig>  were prrsv qrt-pcr negative, whereas all serum samples from boars tested on dpi  <dig>  and dpi  <dig>  were positive. prrsv was detected in oral fluids from  <dig> of  <dig> boars at dpi  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> boars at dpi  <dig>   <dig> of  <dig> at dpi  <dig>  and all boars were prrsv qrt-pcr positive at dpi  <dig>  a comparison of matched samples from individual boars showed that oral fluid was equal to serum for the detection of prrsv at dpi  <dig> and more likely to be positive than serum on dpi  <dig> and  <dig>  these data are reported in detail elsewhere  <cit> .

to evaluate the association between viremia and antibody responses, cumulative serum and oral fluid prrsv qrt-pcr  and antibody isotype  responses over time were re-expressed as area under the curve   prior to performing the analyses. the mean qrt-pcr and antibody isotype aucs for serum and oral fluid are given in table  <dig>  statistical analysis  of main effects showed significant differences among trials , sample type , and quantitative responses . with the exception of serum igg, statistically significant differences in means were detected among trials both in the replication of prrsvs and in antibody responses  test). however, at the individual boar level, correlation analysis found a weak association between prrsv viremia auc and serum igm, iga, or igg aucs . likewise, the correlation was weak between prrsv oral fluid auc and oral fluid igm, iga, or igg aucs .

 <dig> individual boar prrsv  and antibody  s/p responses over time were summarized as the area under the curve  prior to performing the statistical analysis.

discussion
by definition, oral fluid is a mixture of saliva, oral mucosal transudate, and gingival crevicular fluid recovered from the buccal cavity using an absorptive device  <cit> . among a variety of other constituents, oral fluid contains both locally-derived and systemic antibodies  <cit> . thus, pathogen-specific igm, iga, and igg for prrsv  <cit> , influenza a virus  <cit> , and porcine circovirus type  <dig>  <cit>  could be detected in oral fluid samples collected from groups of pigs  under either experimental or field conditions. the largest proportion of locally produced antibody consists of dimeric secretory iga  produced by plasma cells in salivary glands and duct-associated lymphoid tissue   <cit> . igm and igg are also produced in these tissues, but the majority of igm and igg in oral fluid is derived from serum via the gingival crevicular fluid  <cit> .

in the present experiment, the collection of paired oral fluid and serum samples from  <dig> individually-housed boars inoculated with three different prrsv isolates allowed for a more comprehensive evaluation of the onset and magnitude of serum and oral fluid antibody isotype responses, as well as the variation therein. statistically significant differences in viral replication and antibody responses were observed among the three trials in both serum and oral fluid specimens . since each trial included only one virus isolate, statistically valid comparisons of the effects of virus isolates on prrsv replication and antibody responses were not possible. nevertheless, the statistically significant differences in virus replication and antibody response observed among trials was consistent with previous reports of virus isolate-dependent differences in the magnitude of replication in pigs  <cit>  and corresponding differences in antibody response  <cit> . however, at the individual boar level, the correlation between virus replication and antibody response was relatively weak. thus, what was true for the group of boars in a trial did not necessarily apply to an individual boar.

the purpose of this study was to describe and contrast the kinetics of prrsv antibody in oral fluids and serum. prrsv serum igm, iga, and igg were first detected in samples collected on dpi  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. these results were compatible with prior reports describing the detection of prrsv serum igm between dpi  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , igg between dpi  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> , and iga at dpi  <dig>  <cit> . prrsv oral fluid igm, iga, and igg appeared concurrently with serum antibodies, but collection of daily oral fluid samples provided more precise estimates. that is, oral fluid igm, iga, and igg were detected in samples collected between dpi  <dig> to  <dig>   <dig> to  <dig>  and  <dig> to  <dig>  respectively. there are no prior reports on prrsv oral fluid antibody kinetics in individual animals with which to compare these results. however, we previously reported the detection of prrsv oral fluid igm and igg in pen-based oral fluid samples from experimentally inoculated animals on dpi  <dig>  <cit> . thus, the prrsv serum and oral fluid antibody responses observed in this study were in agreement with prior observations on prrsv and our general understanding of the humoral immune response as reflected in these sample matrices  <cit> . most significantly, this study provided a broader foundation for understanding, developing, and interpreting oral fluid antibody-based diagnostics in the context of the humoral immune response.

CONCLUSIONS
this study demonstrated that anti-prrsv antibody isotypes can be detected in oral fluid specimens. these results were compatible with prior reports describing the detection of anti-prrsv antibody in both serum and oral fluid. detection of prrsv antibody in oral fluids collected from individual boars could provide an effective approach for monitoring prrsv infection in boar studs. successful oral fluid collection and testing from individual boars suggests that approach could also be applied to population in swine production systems, i.e. pen-housed sows, farrowing crates, etc.
