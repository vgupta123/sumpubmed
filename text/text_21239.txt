BACKGROUND
human beings have been recently reconsidered as superorganisms in co-evolution with an immense microbial community living in the gastrointestinal tract , the human intestinal microbiota  <cit> . providing important metabolic functions that we have not evolved by our own  <cit> , the intestinal microbiota has a fundamental role for the human health and well being  <cit> . several of our physiological features, such as nutrient processing, maturation of the immune system, pathogen resistance, and development of the intestinal architecture, strictly depend on the mutualistic symbiotic relationship with the intestinal microbiota  <cit> . on the basis of its global impact on human physiology, the intestinal microbiota has been considered an essential organ of the human body  <cit> .

the composition of the adult intestinal microbiota has been determined in three large scale 16s rrna sequences surveys  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of a total of  <dig>  bacterial 16s rrna data from  <dig> adults revealed that, at the phylum level, only a small fraction of the known bacterial diversity is represented in our git. the vast majority of bacteria in the human intestinal microbiota  belongs to six bacterial phyla: firmicutes, bacteroidetes, actinobacteria, proteobacteria, fusobacteria and verrucomicrobia. the two dominant divisions are firmicutes and bacteroidetes, which represent together up to 90% of the total microbiota, with a relative abundance of 65% and 25%, respectively. actinobacteria, proteobacteria, verrucomicrobia and fusobacteria are the subdominants phyla with a relative abundance up to  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 1%, respectively. on the contrary, at lower taxonomic levels, we assist to a real explosion of the bacterial diversity in the human git. at least  <dig>  genera  and  <dig>  phylotypes at the species level  have been identified until now, predicting even a greater diversity at the species level  <cit> . since 70% of these phylotypes are subject-specific, and no phylotype is present at more than  <dig> % abundance in all subjects  <cit> , the intestinal microbiota of each individual has been shown to consist in a subject specific complement of hundreds of genera and thousands of species. however, the large degree of functional redundancy between species and genera allowed identifying a core microbiome at the gene level which is shared between all individuals  <cit> . coding for genes involved in important metabolic functions, this core functional microbiome is fundamental to support the mutualistic symbiotic relationship with the human host.

recently, 16s rrna sequences studies have been carried out with the attempt to describe disease-associated unbalances of the human intestinal microbiota. even though species variability was associated with inter-individual variability, phylum-level changes of the intestinal microbiota were associated with specific diseases. in particular, obesity was characterized by a higher proportion of firmicutes and actinobacteria with respect to bacteroidetes and an overall reduced bacterial diversity  <cit> . differently, inflammatory bowel diseases  were characterized by a marked reduction of bacterial diversity in the clostridium cluster iv and xiva belonging to firmicutes, a decline in bacteroidetes biodiversity, and a correspondent increase in proteobacteria and bacillus  <cit> . analogously, intestinal inflammation has been generally related with a marked increase in enterobacteriaceae and a correspondent decrease in members of the resident colonic bacteria  <cit> . in the light of these findings, it has been recently hypothesized that these high level taxonomic unbalances of the human intestinal microbiota can cause deviations from the core functional microbiome with a final impact on the host physiological state  <cit> .

since more than 75% of the phylotypes detected in the human git does not correspond to cultured species  <cit> , phylogenetic dna-microarrays have been recognized as a valuable tool for a high-throughput, quantitative and systematic analysis of the human intestinal microbiota  <cit> . recently, three different small ribosomal subunit rna  based high-density phylogenetic microarrays for studying the human microbiota have been developed  <cit> . targeting thousands bacterial phylo-types, these dna-microarrays have been successfully applied in studies for the deep phylogenetic characterization of the human intestinal microbiota.

in order to specifically monitor the microbiota unbalances that impact on human physiology independently of the inter-individual variability, here we developed an original dna-microarray for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota, called htf-microbi.array . the relatively low number of targets allowed implementing the ligase detection reaction  technology  <cit>  for the development of the htf-microbi.array. this enzymatic in vitro reaction, based on the discriminative properties of the dna ligation enzyme, requires the design of a pair of two adjacent oligonucleotides specific for each target sequence: a probe specific for the variation  which carries a 5'-fluorescent label, and a second probe, named "common probe" , starting one base 3'-downstream of the ds that carries a 5'-phosphate group and a unique sequence named czipcode at its 3'-end. the oligonucleotide probe pairs and a thermostable dna ligase are used in a ldr reaction with previously pcr-amplified dna fragments. this reaction is cycled to increase product yield. the ldr products, obtained only in presence of a perfectly matching template by action of the dna ligase, are addressed to a precise location onto a universal array , where a set of artificial sequences, called zip-codes are arranged. these products carry both the fluorescent label and a unique czipcode sequence and can be detected by laser scanning and identified according to their location within the array. the ldr approach is a highly specific and sensitive assay for detecting single nucleotide variations; thus, differences of a single base along the 16s rrna gene can be employed to distinguish among different microbial lineages. the htf-microbi.array was successfully tested in a pilot study for the characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight healthy young adults.

RESULTS
target selection and probe design
the rational selection of the htf-microbi.array targets was carried out using a phylogenetic approach. to this aim we implemented the 16s rrna database of the arb project  with the 16s rrna gene database of the rdp available at the time and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. based on the tree nodes,  <dig> phylogenetical groups of the human intestinal microbiota were rationally selected as the target group for the htf-microbi.array . in fig.  <dig> we report the phylogenetic tree of the 16s rrna sequences of the htf-microbi.array positive set. the selected groups belonged to different phylogenetic levels . the entire list of the array targets is represented in table  <dig>  for part of the division firmicutes, the target selection was carried out based on the classification proposed by collins et al.  <cit> . clostridium cluster i and ii, clostridium cluster ix, clostridium cluster xi, and clostridium cluster xiva were selected. for the clostridium cluster iv, four subgroups of species were defined: ruminococcus albus et rel., ruminococcus bromii et rel., faecalibacterium prausnitzii et rel., and oscillospira guillermondii et rel. within the firmicutes division, the family lactobacillaceae, and the groups bacillus clausii et rel., bacillus subtilis et rel., bacillus cereus et rel., enterococcus faecalis et rel., and enterococcus faecium et rel. were also selected. other selected groups were the bacteroides/prevotella cluster , the family bifidobacteriaceae , the family enterobacteriaceae and the genus campylobacter . for clusters or families, relevant species, genera or subgroups of species were selected to design "sub-probes". the genus veillonella was selected for clostridium cluster ix, the species eubacterium rectale for clostridium cluster xiva, clostridium difficile for clostridium cluster xi, and clostridium perfringens for clostridium cluster i and ii. the group bifidobacterium longum et rel. was chosen for the family bifidobacteriaceae, and the genera yersinia and proteus for the enterobacteriaceae. based on an original phylogenetic design, the entire probe set of the htf-microbi.array cover up to 95% of the bacterial groups belonging to the human intestinal microbiota  <cit> .

for each probe is indicated the spot number, the phylogenetic level, the phylogeny of the target group, the ecology in the gastrointestinal ecosystem . the relative abundance in a healthy gut ecosystem of the principal microbial groups is also indicated.

specificity and coverage of each candidate probe was assessed by using the tool probe match of the rdp database. the probe pairs selected for the htf-microbi.array were required to perfectly match the sequences of the positive set and to possess at least a mismatch at the 3' end of the discriminating probe respect to the entire negative set. the designed probes pairs had an average melting temperature  of  <dig>  ±  <dig> °c  and an average length of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  nucleotides. sixteen out of the  <dig> probe pairs were characterized by having no degenerated bases, whereas only one probe pair  had  <dig> and  <dig> ambiguous bases on ds and cp, respectively .

validation of the htf-microbi.array
ldr probe pair specificity
the specificity of the designed ldr probe pairs was tested by using 16s rrna pcr amplicons from  <dig> microorganisms members of the human intestinal microbiota. amplicons were prepared by amplification of genomic dna extracted from dsmz cultures or genomic dna from atcc collection. proving the specificity of the htf-microbi.array all the 16s rrna amplicons were properly recognized in separate ldr hybridization reactions with the entire probe set of the array. two replicated independent ldr-ua experiments were performed with an optimal reproducibility . for each of the 16s rrna template only group-specific spots, and spots corresponding to the hybridization controls showed positive signals  . as a negative control, we performed two independent pcr-ldr-ua experiments using double distilled water, instead of genomic dna, as sample. as expected, no positive signal was detected. the ratio between the signal intensities of the specific probes and the blank intensity  averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig> , whereas the ratio between all the other probes and the blank intensity  averaged  <dig>  ±  <dig> . therefore, the ratio between specific and non-specific probes resulted more than  <dig> fold on average.

table reporting the results of the tests to assess probe specificity:  <dig> bacterial dna targets were chosen to validate the probe pairs. for each dna analyzed we report: probe pair showing significant signals, snrs, snrns . the p-values of specific probes are reported for each duplicate experiment. where needed , data are the average of the positive signals 

evaluation of the ldr sensitivity and relative abundance detection level
in order to define the detection limits of the htf-microbi.array, ldr-ua experiments were carried out with different concentrations of an artificial mix of 16s rrna amplicons from  <dig> members of the human intestinal microbiota. the 16s rrna amplicons from bacillus cereus, lactobacillus casei, bifidobacterium adolescentis, ruminococcus albus, prevotella, y. enterocolitica were all specifically recognized in a range of concentrations from  <dig>  to  <dig> fmol , demonstrating the high sensitivity and specificity of the array . subsequently, in order to evaluate the relative abundance detection level of the htf-microbi.array, ldr-ua experiments were performed on hybridization mixes containing low quantities of escherichia coli pcr products and increasing amounts of human genomic dna. this is a fundamental issue in the case of single species present in the gut microbiota at very low fractional abundance   <cit> . according to our data,  <dig> fmol of e. coli amplicon was sufficient  to be detected in all the tested conditions  . considering the pcr product as a ~ <dig> bp amplicon,  <dig> fmol corresponds to  <dig>  ng and, thus, the sensitivity limit results  <dig> %.

characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight healthy young adults
the htf-microbi.array was applied in a pilot study for the characterization of the faecal microbiota of eight young adults. for all subjects faecal dna was extracted, total bacterial 16s rrna amplified, and two separate ldr-ua experiments were carried out . for each sample a profile of presence-absence probes response was obtained. the cluster analysis of the phylogenetic fingerprints showed that, with the exception of subject n.  <dig>  samples from the same subject clustered together. the reproducibility of the experiments was evaluated by considering the percentage of the probes giving the same response in both the technical replicates of each sample. with the exclusion of subject n.  <dig>  an average reproducibility of 96% was obtained for all the subject under study, demonstrating a good reproducibility of the microbiota fingerprints obtained using the htf-microbi.array . as expected, the major mutualistic symbionts of the human intestinal microbiota, such as bacteroidetes and the members of the clostridium cluster iv and xiva, were represented in the faecal microbiota of all the subjects. with the exception of b. clausii et rel., minor mutualistic symbionts such as actinobacteria, lactobacillaceae, b. subtilis et rel., fusobacterium, and cyanobacteria were detected only in different sub-fractions of the subjects. in particular, subjects n.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were characterized by the presence of fusobacterium. subjects n.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> possessed b. subtilis et rel., while subjects n.  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> harboured cyanobacteria in their faecal microbiota. on the other hand, only a fraction of the subjects, clustering on the left side of the map, presented opportunistic pathogens in their faecal microbiota. subjects n.  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> presented both proteus and e. faecalis et rel., while in subject n.  <dig> members of the clostridium cluster i and ii and yersinia et rel. were also detected. for each subject the relative fluorescence intensity  contribution of each htf-microbi.array probes, in terms of percentage of the total if, was also calculated . the mean of if data from both the ldr-ua experiments were considered. even if all subjects were characterized by a specific individual profile, a common trend can be found by comparing the comprehensive relative if contribution of probes targeting major mutualistic symbionts , minor mutualistic symbionts , and opportunistic pathogens . in particular, for all subjects the highest relative if contributions were obtained for major mutualistic symbionts. the contribution of bacteroides/prevotella ranged between 8-37%, whereas the contribution of clostridium clusters iv, ix, and xiva ranged between 17-34%, 3-15%, and 5-29%, respectively. differently, minor mutualistic symbionts were characterized by lower values of relative if contributions. bifidobacteriaceae contributed for the  <dig> - <dig> %, lactobacillaceae for the  <dig> - <dig> %, b. clausii et rel. for the 4-13%, b. subtilis et rel. for the  <dig> - <dig> %, fusobacterium for the  <dig> - <dig> %, and cyanobacterium for  <dig> - <dig> %. as expected, opportunistic pathogens showed together the lowest relative if contribution in all the subjects under study .

discussion
in these last years, 16s rrna microarrays emerged as a sensitive and efficient way to screen complex bacterial communities. here we describe and validate the htf-microbi.array, a new phylogenetic dna microarray designed for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbial community. the htf-microbi.array is based on the ldr-ua approach, which is a fast and sensitive tool for the characterization of complex microbial communities with high sensitivity and specificity  <cit> . the use of this molecular technique allows overcoming the major limitations of dna microarrays whose discriminative power is based on hybridization. in fact, a) optimization of the hybridization conditions for each probe set is not required; b) problems due to the secondary structures of the target dna are minimized, c) steric hindrances of differentially sized nucleic acid hybrids formed on the array after the hybridization are decreased  <cit> . the final probe set of the htf-microbi.array allows a high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota, with a good coverage of the major and minor components, as well as some of the most important pathogens and opportunistic bacteria  <cit> . the ldr probes were designed by choosing ds oligonucleotides whose 3'end allowed the perfect discrimination of the target species from the non-target ones on the basis of our 16s rrna sequence database. definition of accurate and specific negative sets of gut microbiota sequences by orma tool  <cit>  allowed the selection of maximally discriminative probe pairs. probe specificity was confirmed on the entire known 16s rrna gene sequences environment by the rdp probe match tool. this requirement is fundamental, since the primer set used for the pcr amplification was the "universal" 16s rrna primer set designed by edwards and co-workers  <cit> .

the htf-microbi.array recognized without ambiguity the 16s rrna amplicons obtained from  <dig> members of the intestinal microbiota belonging to bacteroides/prevotella, clostridium clusters iv, ix, xiva, xi, i and ii, bifidobacteriaceae, lactobacillaceae, bacillus, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and campylobacter, demonstrating the specificity of all the probe pairs. the sensitivity of the htf-microbi.array was evaluated by using different concentrations of an artificial mix of 16s rrna amplicons obtained from  <dig> microorganisms members of the human intestinal microbiota. to compensate the eventual drop in the signal due to a very low target concentrations, lower than  <dig>  fmol , a slightly relaxed criteria for significance of the t-test to α =  <dig>  was chosen. all pcr products were specifically recognized in a concentration range from  <dig> to  <dig>  fmol, showing high array sensitivity. the efficiency of the htf-microbi.array in the detection of a particular target in a complex dna environment was also determined. according to our data, the array is able to detect a specific dna target down to  <dig> % of the total 16s rrna, which is comparable to the values obtained by rajilic-stojanovic et al.  <cit>  and palmer et al.  <cit> . thus the htf-microbi.array shows the potentiality to sense low abundant species of the gastrointestinal microbiota, enabling the detection of the 16s rrna of a peculiar target group present at a fractional abundance < <dig> % in an artificial mixture.

the htf-microbi.array was used in a pilot study to characterize the faecal microbiota of eight young adults. faecal microbiota was chosen as dna source since sample collection is not invasive, samples contain large amount of microbes, and, most important, it is representative of interpersonal differences in distal gut microbial ecology  <cit> . in order to have a good representation of the less abundant species of the intestinal microbial community, ldr reactions were performed starting from  <dig> fmol of pcr product. cluster analysis of the presence-absence probes profiles enabled the identification of a reproducible high taxonomic level microbiota fingerprint for each subject. as expected, the intestinal microbial community of the voluntaries in the study resembled the typical fingerprint of healthy adults  <cit> . according to our data, the faecal microbiota of the enrolled subjects was dominated by major mutualistic symbionts. in fact, members of bacteroidetes, clostridium clusters iv, ix and xiva were all represented in 100% of the subjects. on the other hand, minor mutualistic symbionts, such as lactobacillaceae, b. subtilis et re., fusobacterium and cyanobacteria, were detected in  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 63% of the subjects, respectively. opportunistic pathogens, such as e. faecalis et rel., members of the clostridium cluster i and ii and enterobacteriaceae, were represented only in  <dig>   <dig> and 12% of the subjects, respectively. most importantly, enteropathogens such as, c. difficile, c. perfringens, e. faecium et rel., b. cereus et rel., and campylobacter were never detected. a discrepancy between our data and the literature is the relatively low prevalence of the health promoting bifidobacteriaceae in our samples . however, the low prevalence of bifidobacteria is a typical bias for several phylogenetic dna microarrays  <cit> . probably this is due to the intrinsic low efficiency of amplification of the bifidobacterial genome with universal primer sets for the 16s rrna gene  <cit> . surprisingly, a high prevalence was obtained for the minor mutualistic symbiont b. clausii et rel., 100% of samples, and the opportunistic pathogen proteus, 50% of samples. for each subject the relative if contributions of the probes were calculated, obtaining an approximate evaluation of the relative abundance of the principal microbial groups of the faecal microbiota. in general agreement with previous metagenomic studies  <cit>  and ssu rrna phylogenetic microarray investigations  <cit> , mutualistic symbionts such as bacteroidetes, clostridium clusters iv, ix and xiva largely dominated the faecal microbiota, contributing for the  <dig> to 80% of total microbiota, depending on the subject. differently, with an overall contribution ranging from  <dig> to 30%, minor mutualistic symbionts such as b. clausii et rel., bifidobacteriaceae, lactobacillaceae, b. subtilis et rel., fusobacterium, and cyanobacteria were largely subdominant. opportunistic pathogens represented only a small fraction of the intestinal microbiota. even if subjects under study show a common trend when the ratio between the relative if of major, minor and opportunistic components were considered, differences in the relative if contribution of single probes were detectable and subject specific profiles were identified. for instance, subject n.  <dig> showed a higher relative fluorescence for probes targeting major mutualistic symbionts and a lower relative fluorescence for minor mutualistic symbionts and opportunistic pathogens than subjects n.  <dig> and  <dig>  on the other hand subjects n.  <dig> and  <dig> were characterized by a lower ratio bacteroidetes/firmicutes with respect to all the other subjects. it is tempting to hypothesize that differences in relative if contribution within samples could represent an approximation of differences in relative abundances of the targeted groups in the faecal microbiota. however, caution must be taken when microarray based methods for the relative quantification of bacterial groups in complex microbial communities are used. in fact, biases are introduced at several levels of the experimental procedure: dna extraction and purification, pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene, and interspecies variation of the rrna gene copy number  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the htf-microbi.array has been revealed a fast and sensitive tool for the high taxonomic level fingerprint of the human intestinal microbiota in terms of presence/absence of the principal groups. since the flexibility of the universal array platform allow the addition of new probe pairs without a further optimization of the hybridization conditions  <cit> , the htf-microbi.array can be easy implemented with the addition of new probe pairs targeting emerging microbial groups of the human intestinal microbiota, such as, for instance, the mucin degrading bacterium akkermansia muciniphila  <cit> . the evaluation of the relative abundance of the target groups on the bases of the relative if probes response still has some hindrances. however, considered all the possible biases  typical of the microarray technology, analysis of ifs from our ldr-ua platform can be useful in the estimation of the relative abundance of the targets groups within each sample. focusing the phylogenetic resolution at division, order and cluster levels, the htf-microbi.array results blind with respect to the inter-individual variability at the species level. its potential to characterize the high order taxonomic unbalances of the human intestinal microbiota associated with specific diseases will be assessed in further studies.
