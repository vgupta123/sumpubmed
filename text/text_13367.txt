BACKGROUND
in most fish species, the sex chromosomes are still in early stages of differentiation compared to mammals, and do not show distinct differences in length or gene content  <cit> . instances of both xx/xy male heterogametic and wz/zz female heterogametic sex-determining systems can be found in fish, while the fact that spontaneous sex-reversed xx males are generally fully fertile indicates that sex-determining regions can also be located on autosomes. even though the yy genotype is lethal in mammals, yy and ww genotypes are viable in most fish species indicating that the gene content of the y and w chromosomes are very similar to that of their x and z counterparts respectively  <cit> . generally an even sex ratio can be expected in species with genetic sex determination. however, departures from an equal sex ratio have been observed both in population and family studies, stressing the complexities of sex-determination in fish. distorted population or family sex ratios are likely to be due to hormonal effects, complex genetic sex determination or interaction between genetic and environmental factors  <cit> . environmental effects on sex ratios may vary even within species  <cit> .

many species of farmed fish exhibit sexual dimorphism in a range of traits of commercial importance, including growth rate or age at maturity, stimulating research to clarify the sex determining system of such fish with the objective of the production of mono-sex stocks for the aquaculture industry. oreochromis niloticus  is one of the most important farmed species with a production exceeding  <dig>  million tonnes in  <dig>  <cit> . intensive commercial production generally requires all-male stocks, not only because males grow faster but also to avoid uncontrolled reproduction before harvest.

current evidence suggests that o. niloticus possesses a complex sex determination system comprising an xx/xy male heterogametic system with other genetic and environmental factors . the major sex-determining region has been previously located on linkage group   <dig>  <cit>  and fine mapped in a region of approximately  <dig>  mb  <cit> .

frequent departures from equal sex ratio have also been observed where the temperature was not high enough to affect sexual differentiation, and it has been postulated that these departures are caused by other loci, potentially including those in lg  <dig>  and lg  <dig>  <cit> . interestingly crosses between putative yy males and xx females often give less than 100% male progeny predicted from a simple xx/xy system: some such crosses give close to 100% males, while others give lower proportions of males, but still significantly higher than the 50% expected from xy males  <cit> . many of the studies on sex determination in o. niloticus have been carried out on fish derived from lake manzala in egypt, the subject of the present study, and it is clear that both non-lg  <dig> genes and temperature affect sex ratios in at least some families in this population.

temperature can affect sex ratios in o. niloticus, with rearing temperatures above 34°c during sexual differentiation having masculinising effects  <cit> . male ratios in elevated temperature-treated o. niloticus are strongly dependent both on the population and on the parental animals  <cit> . family-specific quantitative trait loci  involved in sex reversal due to temperature have been identified in lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> in genetically all-female families, coinciding with known sex-determining regions of o. niloticus  <cit> . those studies  <cit>  were carried out on a sub-population of the stirling lake manzalla-derived population.

in a previous study  <cit>  we applied a genotyping by sequencing approach using snps screened by restriction-site associated dna  sequencing  <cit>  in order to scan for sex-determining qtl in o. niloticus families of balanced sex ratios. no sex-determining region apart from the known one in lg  <dig> was detected. notably, the only misassigned individuals in both the mapping families and other samples used for validation  were phenotypic males with the lg  <dig> genotype expected of females, suggesting that they had undergone sex reversal.

in the current study we extended the search for sex-determining qtls by analysing segregating snp polymorphisms in five families of o. niloticus exhibiting pronounced skewed sex ratios. rather than using standard rad to screen for a highly redundant set of informative snps within pedigrees, we employed a variant of this technology; double digest rad , which allowed a subset of the rad loci to be surveyed more straightforwardly and more economically. we identified one qtl in lg  <dig> that conferred masculinisation to fish classified as xx females by their lg  <dig> genotype, while also finding evidence for an additional second sex- determining qtl in lg  <dig>

genetic maps
in order to maximise the number of informative markers and minimise the amount of missing or erroneous data, we used snp markers retrieved in at least 75% of the samples in each family, and carrying one or two snps. genetic maps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were constructed from offspring of families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively . the linkage groups were named according to the broad institute of mit and harvard genome assembly orenil <dig>  . the genetic map derived from family  <dig> proved to be the most comprehensive, since it was derived from an outbred cross, and consisted of  <dig>  snps , grouped in  <dig> linkage groups that corresponded to  <dig> different chromosomes . the total length was  <dig>  cm .table  <dig>

the family  <dig> genetic map consisted of  <dig> markers , grouped in  <dig> linkage groups that corresponded to  <dig> different chromosomes. the total length was  <dig> cm . this map did not contain information about chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> due to a lack of informative loci on those chromosomes. the family  <dig> genetic map consisted of  <dig> markers , grouped into  <dig> linkage groups that corresponded to  <dig> different chromosomes, with chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> being represented by two markers in total that were grouped in the same linkage group. the total length of the map was  <dig> cm . this map did not contain information about chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  the number of informative markers in families  <dig> and  <dig> was lower as the dams were isogenic. missing chromosomes were not the same in maps  <dig> and  <dig> 

qtl mapping and association analysis 
qtl mapping for family  <dig> was conducted using r/qtl. the results from the single-qtl model for binary traits provided evidence for the existence of a qtl in lg  <dig>  in the expected position of the major sex determining region , and a second strong qtl in lg  <dig> . the genome-wide significance threshold for the single-qtl model had a value of lod =  <dig>  . explained variances of the above qtls were estimated after running a multi-dimensional qtl model. the qtl on lg  <dig> explained approximately  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance , while the qtl on lg  <dig> explained approximately 25% of the phenotypic variance .figure  <dig>

the estimated 95% bayesian density interval for the qtl on lg  <dig> spanned a region of  <dig>  cm . in terms of physical distance the above interval corresponds to approximately  <dig>  mb . the qtl mapping on the reduced dataset  detected only the qtl on lg  <dig> , which explained approximately 51%  of the phenotypic variance . the estimated 95% bayesian density interval spanned a region of  <dig>  cm . in terms of physical distance the above interval corresponds to approximately  <dig>  mb . snp marker oni <dig> showed the highest association for the putative sex-reversed offspring . the marker is located in the emilin-3-like gene of o. niloticus .

qtl mapping using the single-qtl model for family  <dig> also identified the qtl in lg  <dig> in the same position as in family  <dig> . the genome-wide significance threshold for the single-qtl model had a value of lod =  <dig>  . the multi-dimensional qtl model estimated that the above qtl explained approximately  <dig> % of the phenotypic variance .

the fisher’s exact tests confirmed significant deviations  in terms of allelic association in snp marker oni <dig> for offspring with the female expected genotype in the major sex-determining region in lg  <dig>  while the corresponding testing for offspring with the male expected genotype was non-significant .table  <dig>

the association analysis on offspring from families  <dig> and  <dig>  adjusted for family effect, in addition to markers from lg  <dig>  identified oni <dig>  on lg  <dig> as significantly associated with phenotypic sex. although no dna from the sires of families  <dig> and  <dig> was available for analysis, all of the progeny in families  <dig> and  <dig> were heterozygous for this snp marker, inferring that the male was homozygous for the t allele  and suggesting that homozygosity at the associated qtl was responsible for the high proportion of males in these families.

high temperature-treated family 
qtl mapping for family  <dig> was conducted using both r/qtl and gridqtl. only male-informative snps provided evidence for existence of sex-determining qtl. in the r/qtl analysis, the results from the single-qtl model for binary traits provided evidence for the existence of a qtl in lg  <dig>  in the expected position of the major sex-determining region . the genome-wide significance threshold for the single-qtl model had a value of lod =  <dig>  .

the multidimensional qtl model provided evidence for the existence of a second, weaker qtl on lg  <dig>  in this model, the qtl on lg  <dig> explained approximately 28% of the phenotypic variance , while the lg  <dig> qtl explained approximately 6% of the phenotypic variance .

in the gridqtl analysis using the half-sib regression model for single-qtl and treatment as a fixed effect, only the qtl on lg  <dig>  was significant at the genome-wide threshold, while the qtl on lg  <dig>  was significant only at the chromosome-wide level . the genome-wide significance threshold, estimated using  <dig>  permutations, had a value of f =  <dig>  . the two-qtl model indicated the possible existence of an additional qtl on lg  <dig> . the above qtl was located on the 11th cm, with the peak approximately  <dig>  mb  distant from the aromatase gene cyp19a <dig>  the fisher’s exact tests confirmed significant deviations in terms of allelic combinations both in the case of the snp marker with the highest association in lg  <dig>  and in the case of the snp marker oni <dig>  for offspring with the female-expected genotype in the major sex determining region . the corresponding testing for offspring with the male expected genotype was non-significant .

discussion
previous studies emphasised the complexities of the o. niloticus sex-determining system by identifying sex-determining qtl in different chromosomes  <cit> . at the same time temperature also affects sex ratio, possibly interacting with genetic factors  <cit>  and family-specific qtl involved in temperature induced sex reversal of genotypic females have been detected  <cit> . additionally, the results of ezaz et al.  <cit>  suggested that some genetic factors might cause sex reversal in both directions, i.e. some families showed departures from both all-male and all-female sex ratios, while others showed no departures in either direction. all the above explain to a certain degree the observed departures from equal sex ratio that a simple xx/xy sex-determining system would suggest.

the main limitation of the previous studies that tried to detect sex-determining regions in o. niloticus was the limited number of genetic markers available, mainly concentrating on linkage groups  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  however, since departures from equal sex ratio are not observed in all crosses, the usage of suitable crosses is also a necessary prerequisite for mapping sex-determining qtl other than lg  <dig> in o. niloticus, and in particular previously undetected qtl. in our previous study  <cit>  we developed a high-resolution map of o. niloticus using families with balanced sex ratios, from which only the major sex-determining region on lg  <dig> was detected. in this study, we applied ddrad in families with skewed sex ratios, in which we expected that additional qtl would be affecting sex determination.

all the samples used in the current study were genotyped for two snp markers located in the expected major sex-determining region in lg  <dig>  and one microsatellite  that is also tightly linked to this region  <cit> . the only misassigned individuals were phenotypic males appearing with the expected female genotype, as seen in our previous study  <cit> . this indicates sex reversal of genotypic  females.

the detected qtl in lg  <dig> in the current study provides the first evidence for a sex-determining region in this chromosome with possible involvement in sex reversal. the possibility that the above qtl is involved in sex reversal is also strengthened by the fact that its lod score more than doubled in the analysis of family  <dig>  when only the females and the putative sex-reversed males were used. a qtl on lg  <dig> was also identified in the analysis of family  <dig> offspring. although the significance was just above the genome-wide threshold when the single-qtl model was used , using the multi-dimensional qtl model provided clear evidence of its existence . the difference in the estimated qtl values between family  <dig> and  <dig> is most probably due to the lower statistical power of the analysis of family  <dig> due to its smaller informative sample size, requiring the usage of more elaborate models. models that take into account the existence of a major qtl  or ones that test for existence of multiple qtls simultaneously reduce the residual variation - providing higher power in the analysis for detecting additional qtls at least of moderate effect  <cit> .

the inferred paternal genotypes  were not informative concerning the most probable location for the qtl on lg  <dig> . no qtl apart from the expecting one on lg  <dig>  was identified in those families. it seems likely that the sires of families  <dig> and  <dig> were homozygous for the masculinizing allele of the lg  <dig> qtl and thus non-informative for this analysis. however, the association analysis conducted on offspring from four families  provided evidence for the existence of a genome-wide significant sex-determining region on lg  <dig> 

the qtl on lg  <dig> was found to be significant only at the chromosome-wide level in the high temperature-treated family . it has to be stressed though, that the data from the high temperature-treated cross was not as informative as that from family  <dig> or family  <dig>  the fact that the high temperature-treated group contained almost all male progeny, with only  <dig> females, forced us to analyse both treated and control groups simultaneously, adding the factor treatment as a fixed effect . crosses involving high temperature treatment of genetic all-female progeny  <cit>  would have been more informative. however, the fact that a signal in terms of association with sex was detected at the same genomic location in families  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> would suggest that the same underlying mechanism is involved in both cases, causing sex reversal of genotypic females.

interestingly the two-dimensional qtl scan in the temperature-treated family  provided evidence for another qtl at the beginning of lg  <dig>  which could also be implicated in sex reversal. the location of the above qtl is in proximity  to the cyp19a <dig> gene. cyp19a <dig> is the enzyme that catalyses the irreversible conversion of androgens into oestrogens and has been shown to be suppressed at masculinising temperatures  <cit> . methylation in the promoter of cyp19a <dig> was shown to be involved in temperature-dependent sex-determination in dicentrarchus labrax . however, it has to be stressed that in the current study, we cannot exclude the possibility of this qtl on lg  <dig> being a false positive.

o. niloticus presents a unique combination of properties for the study of the genetic basis of elevated temperature effects on sex determination. although temperature effects on sex determination have been observed in many species of fish and reptiles, intraspecific polymorphism for this trait has been found in only a few species. in addition to tilapia, this has been documented in menidia menidia , alligator mississipiensis , chelydra serpentine , chrysemys picta  and lepomis macrochirus . such polymorphism allows approaches such as mapping the responsible loci, which in the case of o. niloticus is facilitated by the ease with which it can be bred and reared in captivity and the supporting genomics resources. to our knowledge, mapping studies on genes controlling temperature effects on sex determination have only been carried out in the nile tilapia: the results emerging from these studies map loci controlling variation in temperature effects  to genomic regions that have been demonstrated to have strong effects on sex determination at standard rearing temperatures .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the current study provides new insights about novel sex-determining regions in lg  <dig> and lg  <dig> involved in o. niloticus sex reversal relative to the main sex-determining region in lg  <dig>  in the case of the qtl on lg  <dig>  strong evidence of its existence is supported by the results from three different families. more informative crosses, especially concerning the study of temperature effects, would shed more light concerning the magnitude of the detected qtls. it seems likely that these  qtl could account for the unexpected sex ratios encountered during the development of yy o. niloticus, and the difficulties in producing high percentages of males in progeny of yys with only phenotypic sex ratio as a tool. the outcome of the current study stresses the complexities of the o. niloticus sex determining system and the potential offered by high-throughput sequencing platforms like ddrad-seq in unveiling those complexities.
