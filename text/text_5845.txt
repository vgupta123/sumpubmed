BACKGROUND
expressed sequence tags , which are created by partially sequencing randomly isolated gene transcripts and converting them into cdnas
 <cit> , provide a valuable information source for investigating a wide variety of genetic characteristics of a species. since they represent the expressed portion of a genome, ests have been reported to play significant roles in accelerating gene discovery, improving genome annotation
 <cit> , uncovering whole genome duplication events and facilitating evolutionary analysis
 <cit> . furthermore, est analysis represents an effective means to for rapidly identify transcripts involved in specific biological processes
 <cit> .

est collections also represent a valuable resource to identify simple sequence repeat  and single nucleotide polymorphism  markers. in recent years, ssr markers have been increasingly used to construct high-density genetic maps and to identify quantitative trait loci  associated with economically important crop traits
 <cit> . while snps typically provide more useful markers in many basic and applied research areas, such as population genetics, gene discovery, plant breeding and germplasm identification
 <cit> , the steps from sequencing and snp discovery to snp marker design and validation are generally lengthy and expensive. as a consequence of the rapid development of next generation sequencing technologies and progress with genome and cdna sequencing projects, extremely large numbers of ests are becoming publicly available. some of these sequence resources have been already exploited for the development of molecular markers such as ssrs
 <cit>  and snps
 <cit> , which have value in both elucidating phylogenetic relationships and facilitating breeding programs.

radish , an economically important root vegetable crop that is grown and consumed worldwide, belongs to brassicaceae and is closely related to brassica rapa and the experimental model plant arabidopsis thaliana. its fleshy, edible root varies in shape , size  and color 
 <cit> . although there are no detailed archeological records describing the early history of radish cultivation, it has been suggested that it was domesticated in europe in pre-roman times
 <cit> . however, the origin of cultivated radish is still debated. r. raphanistrum, the wild species of r. sativus, includes three subspecies: subsp. maritimus; subsp. raphanistrum; and subsp. landra. most reports suggest that r. sativus l. originated from r. raphanistrum l., but it has also been proposed that r. sativus resulted from hybridization between r. maritimus and r. landra, or alternatively that it derived from interspecific hybridization between a variety of parental species
 <cit> .

despite its agricultural importance as a root vegetable crop, radish has only recently been analyzed using genomic and functional genomic approaches. for example, transcriptome studies have been reported, with a focus on ssr marker development
 <cit>  and expression profiling in response to lead exposure
 <cit> . there are currently more than  <dig>  publicly available ests in the ncbi dbest database
 <cit> , but this large-scale est dataset has not been characterized in detail, and has primarily been used to derive ssr markers for genetic map construction. in order to integrate and utilize these data efficiently, and to gain more insights into the biology and genome evolution of radish, these radish ests were first clustered and assembled into  <dig>  unigenes. this unigene set was then extensively annotated. comparative genomic analysis of radish, a thaliana and b. rapa were performed in order to elucidate the functional and evolutionary processes that act on their respective genomes. furthermore, putative ssr and snp markers were identified from these ests and the phylogenetic relationships between the different radish genotypes were inferred. this information provided new insights into the biology of major agronomic traits of radish, as well as its genome evolution and the phylogenetic relationships between different genotypes.

RESULTS
est assembly and annotation
a total of  <dig>  raphanus ests were collected from the ncbi dbest database. after removing low quality and contaminating sequences,  <dig>  ests were obtained. of these,  <dig>  were from cultivated radish  and  <dig>  from wild radish , comprising subsets from the three subspecies: subsp. raphanistrum ; subsp. landra ; and subsp. maritimus . these ests were generated from  <dig> different raphanus cdna libraries derived from  <dig> different accessions . different radish organs/tissues were sampled to construct these cdna libraries, including cotyledons, hypocotyls, roots, root axes, leaves, flowers, whole buds and whole seedlings.

ests

the ests were assembled de novo into  <dig>  unigenes with an average length of 822 bp, of which  <dig>  were singletons with an average length of 594 bp and  <dig>  were contigs with an average length of 970 bp. the distribution of the number of est members in the radish unigenes is listed in table 
 <dig>  a total of  <dig>   of the unigenes had more than  <dig> est members and they represented 41% of the total number of est reads.

to functionally annotate the radish unigenes, their sequences were compared against the genbank non-redundant  protein database using the blast program. a total of  <dig>   radish unigenes had hits in the nr database, indicating that a very high percentage of radish unigenes could be assigned a putative function. the radish unigenes were also compared against the uniprot/swissprot, uniprot/trembl and arabidopsis  protein databases, which yielded  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>   matches in these three databases, respectively.

a gene ontology  analysis of the radish unigenes was then undertaken. a total of  <dig>   unigenes were associated with at least one go term, of which  <dig>   were assigned at least one go term in the cellular component category,  <dig>   in the biological process category and  <dig>   in the molecular function category, while  <dig>   were annotated with go terms from all three categories. go slim analysis was then performed to classify the radish unigenes into different functional categories according to the go annotations. biosynthetic process, ion binding and cytoplasm were the most abundant go terms within the biological process, molecular function, and cellular component categories, respectively . in addition, cell differentiation, reproduction, and growth were also among the most highly represented groups within the biological process category, consistent with the fact that the majority of radish ests were derived from whole seedlings, buds and anthers. in addition, genes involved in other important biological processes, such as stress responses and signal transduction, were also identified.

transcription factors  are an important and diverse class of regulatory proteins that can initiate and regulate gene transcription, and that collectively coordinate gene expression in different cell types and during development. in the present study, a thorough screen of the radish unigene dataset was performed to identify putative tfs using itak
 <cit> . a total of  <dig>  tfs were predicted and systematically grouped into  <dig> tf families . the myb family was the most abundant, comprising  <dig> genes, followed by the bhlh , bzip , ap2-erebp  and nac  families. identification of these tfs from radish provides a useful resource to help researchers to gain a better understanding of the intricate relationships between transcription factors and the major agricultural traits of radish.

comparative analysis of gene sets between radish and other plants
the  <dig>  radish unigenes were compared to the complete protein sequence sets of rice, grape, arabidopsis and brassica rapa using the blast program. at an e-value cutoff of 1e- <dig>  approximately 90% and 88% of radish unigenes matched proteins of brassica rapa and a. thaliana, respectively, which belong to the same family of radish, while 79% and 77% matched proteins from grape and rice, respectively.

gene family clustering analysis was performed for the above five plant species. a total of  <dig>  gene sequences from the five species were clustered into  <dig>  gene families . of these,  <dig>  were shared by all five species, and so may represent highly conserved gene families among dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants. of the  <dig>  radish unigenes,  <dig>  were divided among  <dig>  of these gene families, while  <dig>  gene families were unique to radish. the analysis also revealed that  <dig>  gene families were unique to the brassicaceae family . functional analysis using go terms showed that gene families that were specific to the brassicaceae family were significantly enriched with go terms involved in response to hormones, such as auxin and gibberellins, and seed oil body biogenesis . these observations can be associated with well-known characteristics of the brassicaceae since bolting, one of the most important traits of the family, can be induced by gibberellins
 <cit> , and seeds of the brassicaceae contain a high oil content, which makes them good candidates for producing feedstock oils for biodiesel. the oil body is a unique oil storage organelle, consisting mainly of triacylglycerol  surrounded by a layer consisting of phospholipids and the protein oleosin
 <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the quantity and size of oil bodies correlate well with the oil content of rapeseed and that oil body biogenesis may be coupled with the embryogenesis
 <cit> . gene families specific to radish were significantly enriched with go terms related to small molecule metabolic processes, including monosaccharide and organic acid metabolism . this observation aligns well with the most important agronomic product of radish, the fleshy tap root, since during taproot development the carbohydrate content, including total soluble sugars, sucrose and fructose decrease at the onset of taproot swelling,
 <cit> .

whole genome duplications in radish
whole genome duplication  is common in angiosperms and is regarded as the major evolutionary force that gives rise to novel gene functions and transcriptome sequences have been successfully used to identify wgd events
 <cit> . in the present study, gene families were constructed using proteins from four species, a. thaliana, brassica rapa, carica papaya  and radish, which all belong to the order brassicales. a total of  <dig>  gene families with a single gene in each species were used to date speciation events and homologous pairs with best reciprocal matches within each species were used to identify wgd events. a total of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig>  pairs were identified for a. thaliana, b. rapa, papaya and radish, respectively. ks values for these homologous gene pairs were calculated. the peaks of the ks values corresponding to the wgd events in a thaliana, b. rapa, and papaya  are consistent with those presented in the pgdd database
 <cit> , indicating the robustness of the approach.

b. rapa 
, radish and arabidopsis , and radish and papaya .

based on the distribution of ks values of homologous genes, two recent wgd events in radish, α and β, were identified, which were estimated to have occurred approximately  <dig> - <dig>  and  <dig> - <dig>  million years ago , corresponding to the peaks of ks at  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . the β event occurred before the divergence of radish and b. rapa approximately  <dig> - <dig>  mya and is shared by raphanus and brassica, while the α event occurred after the divergence and is raphanus specific. the analysis also indicated that the common ancestor of radish and b. rapa diverged from a. thaliana about  <dig> - <dig>  mya, which is consistent with previous reports
 <cit> .

identification of simple sequence repeats  and single nucleotide polymorphisms 
both ssrs and snps are valuable markers for genetic mapping and marker-assisted breeding. ssr and snp markers derived from est sequences, which directly link to expressed genes, have been widely used in linkage map construction and genetic mapping of qtls associated with important agronomic traits
 <cit> . in the present study, a thorough screen of the radish unigene dataset for the presence of ssrs was performed. a total of  <dig>  ssr motifs were discovered in  <dig>  radish unigenes. the major types of the identified ssrs were tri-nucleotide  and di-nucleotide , accounting for 49% and 44% of the ssrs, respectively, followed by tetra-nucleotide , penta-nucleotide  and hexa-nucleotide . an additional  <dig> ssrs were classified as ssr motifs in compound form; that is, the ssrs contained two or more repeat types separated by none to any number of base pairs. ssr motifs with five repeats  were the most common, followed by six , seven , eight , nine  and ten . the most frequent ssr motif was tc/ga , followed by ag/ct , tct/aga , gaa/ttc , ctt/aag  and gat/atc , while gc/gc  was the least frequent ssr motif . most of these values are in agreement with a previous report of a radish rna-seq dataset
 <cit>  and reports of est analysis from other plant species, including watermelon
 <cit> . of the  <dig>  ssr-containing unigenes, three combinations of primer pairs were designed for each of the  <dig>  ssr motifs that had sufficient flanking sequences.

since the ests described in this study were derived from  <dig> different accessions, including  <dig> cultivated  and  <dig> wild  accessions, it is expected that snps would be highly abundant in this radish est dataset. using very stringent criteria , a total of  <dig>  high-quality snps were detected in  <dig>  unigenes. of these,  <dig>  were transitions,  <dig>  were transversions, and  <dig>  were single-base indels . the identified ssrs and snps and their associated information are available at radishbase
 <cit>  and provide a resource of valuable molecular markers to facilitate radish breeding and research.

phylogenetic relationship analysis
phylogenetic analysis using dna markers is not only an important tool to study the evolutionary relationships between organisms, at many levels, but also a technique that gives much deeper insight into the mechanism of maintenance of polymorphic alleles in populations
 <cit> . to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of different raphanus accessions, a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed for eight accessions that had sufficient ests for the analysis, using a subset of  <dig>  snps that had information derived from all eight accessions . the eight accessions were clearly separated into two groups: the first group included four accessions belonging to cultivated radish  and the second group included four wild radish accessions . in the r. sativus group, rat-tail  <dig> , which is not an edible root variety but rather is used for its slender and edible seedpods, showed a closer phylogenetic relationship with gsk 3- <dig> , which is a selfed progeny from a leading japanese variety of r. sativus known as utsugi-gensuke
 <cit> , which has a long white root
 <cit> . a close phylogenetic relationship was observed between early scarlet globe , known for its globular shape and white fleshy roots, and var. oleiformis, a fodder or oilseed radish . in the wild radish group, two accessions of subsp. raphanistrum formed a sub-group, while subsp. maritimus and subsp. landra clustered together. currently phylogenetic relationships between different radish genotypes remain largely uncertain. lewis-jonas et al.
 <cit>  proposed that a variant of the raphanistrum-landra complex might be the wild ancestor of the cultivated radish, while other studies suggested that the cultivated radish displayed multiple origins
 <cit> . in the present study, a phylogenetic analysis based on  <dig>  snp markers strongly supported the proposition that the four radish cultivars share the same ancestor, which might originate from one subspecies of r. raphanistrum or the complex of the three subspecies. however, further studies are required to definitively establish the phylogenetic relationship between cultivated and wild radishes.

CONCLUSIONS
the analysis of approximately  <dig>  radish ests collected from the ncbi dbest database was presented here. these ests were assembled de novo into  <dig>  unigenes and functionally annotated. comparative analysis between radish ests and other plant genome sequences revealed a number of highly conserved gene families across dicotyledonous and monocotyledons plants, as well as gene families that are specific to members of the brassicaceae and to radish. two recent wgd events were identified in radish; one before and one after the divergence of radish and brassica rapa. in addition, the identified  <dig>  ssrs and  <dig>  high-quality snps represent valuable molecular markers and can be widely used in linkage map construction and the genetic mapping of qtls associated with important agronomic traits. based on  <dig>  identified snps, the phylogenetic relationships between different raphanus species were analyzed to investigate the evolutionary history of radish. the comprehensive analysis of raphanus ests presented in this study will not only facilitate the annotation of the radish genome, which is currently being sequenced, but also provide a valuable resource for marker assisted breeding programs and further functional and comparative genomics analyses.
