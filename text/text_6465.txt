BACKGROUND
appropriate timing of flowering is important for propagation and reproductive success in plants. therefore, flowering time is precisely regulated through the coordinated actions of endogenous developmental cues, such as plant aging and gibberellic acid , and environmental signals, including changes in the length of day or photoperiod and temperature  <cit> . the floral inductive and repressible signals are transduced through well-established flowering genetic pathways, such as photoperiod, vernalization, ga, autonomous, and thermosensory pathways  <cit> , and converge at the floral promoters flowering locus t  and suppressor of constans overexpression  <dig>  and the floral repressor flowering locus c   <cit> .

accumulating evidence support that sugar metabolism and distribution is intimately associated with flowering time control in many plant species  <cit> . plants that are defective in sugar biosynthesis and metabolism exhibit alterations in developmental traits and flowering time  <cit> . it is widely perceived that plants do not flower even under photo-inductive conditions until they accumulate enough sugar reserves for the induction of flowering  <cit> , which is consistent with the observations that low-starch-containing mutants, such as pgm <dig> and pgi, exhibit retarded growth and delayed flowering  <cit> . endogenous sugar levels are directly linked with photosynthetic carbon assimilation  <cit> , indicating that photosynthetic activity also influences flowering transition  <cit> .

while the effects of sugar on flowering time have been widely documented in many plant species, it is still unclear how sugar regulates the timing of flowering. in some cases, sugar promotes flowering, whereas flowering is inhibited in other cases, depending on different plant genotypes and growth conditions  <cit> . the functional ambiguity of sugar in flowering time control reflects the complexity of sugar homeostasis, which is attributed to the combined regulation of biosynthesis, degradation, and distribution in different plant tissues  <cit> . sugar transport also plays a role in flowering time control. arabidopsis mutants that have mutations in sucrose transporter <dig>  gene exhibits early flowering under short days  <cit> . it has been suggested that atsuc <dig> mediates the directional transport of sugar from the phloem to the sink organs and thus reduces sugar transport to the shoot apical meristem. it is also known that down-regulation of stsut <dig> gene in potato promotes flowering  <cit> , supporting the linkage between sugar transport and flowering induction.

roles of sucrose-regulated protein kinases and trehalose-6-phosphate  have been studied in linking sugar metabolism with flowering transition  <cit> . the t6p pathway has been shown to function upstream of the floral integrator ft in the leaves and regulates a flowering pathway that involves microrna <dig> and squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  proteins in the shoot apical meristem  <cit> , supporting a linkage between sugar and a distinct flowering pathway. in addition, it has been shown that photoperiodic control of sugar metabolism is associated with flowering induction in arabidopsis and soybean  <cit> . notably, constans , which is a central regulator of photoperiodic flowering in arabidopsis  <cit> , plays a key role in the signaling pathway by regulating the expression of genes that are involved in sugar metabolism  <cit> , providing a direct evidence that sugar metabolism is linked with photoperiod flowering.

the indeterminate domain -containing transcription factor idd <dig> has been shown to regulate photoperiodic flowering under sugar deprivation conditions  <cit> . whereas idd8-defective idd <dig> mutants exhibit late flowering, idd8-overexpressing plants exhibit early flowering. the expression of suc and sucrose synthase  genes is altered in the transgenic plants and idd <dig> mutants. it has been reported that idd <dig> regulates the sus genes by directly binding to the gene promoters  <cit> . moreover, the sus genes are regulated by photoperiods, indicating that idd <dig> regulation of sucrose metabolism and transport is associated with photoperiodic flowering. however, it is not known how sugar deprivation signals regulate idd <dig> activity at the molecular level.

it is notable that t6p inhibits the activity of the sucrose-non-fermenting <dig> -related kinase  <dig>  in sugar metabolic control of flowering  <cit> . snrk <dig> is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is homologous to yeast snf <dig> and animal amp-dependent protein kinase  <dig>  kinases  <cit> . snrk1/snf1/ampk acts as a metabolic sensor in eukaryotes and is activated under energy deprivation conditions  <cit> . in particular, snrk <dig> knockdown plants exhibit early flowering, whereas snrk <dig> overexpression delays flowering  <cit> . in addition, snrk <dig> is activated, but idd <dig> is inactivated under sugar-limiting conditions, suggesting that snrk <dig> and idd <dig> are functionally interrelated in the sugar metabolic control of flowering.

in this work, we found that akin <dig>  the catalytic α-subunit of snrk <dig> kinases  <cit> , phosphorylates idd <dig> in the nucleus. while akin10-mediated phosphorylation did not affect the nuclear location and dna-binding property of idd <dig>  it significantly reduced the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig>  these results demonstrate that low-sugar levels trigger the snrk1-mediated inactivation of idd <dig> through protein phosphorylation, leading to delay of flowering. the snrk1-idd <dig> module would also be involved in the timing of flowering under abiotic stress conditions, which limit photosynthetic activity and disturb sugar metabolism in plants  <cit> .

RESULTS
idd8- <dig> and akin10-overexpresser exhibit delayed flowering under long days
as an initial step to investigate the functional relationship between akin <dig> and idd <dig> in flowering time control, we compared the flowering phenotypes of arabidopsis plants that have altered expression of idd <dig> and akin <dig> genes. t-dna insertional mutants of akin <dig> and akin <dig> genes  were obtained from the arabidopsis biological resource center . gene expression analysis revealed that they are loss-of-function mutants . we also produced transgenic plants overexpressing either akin <dig> or akin <dig> gene under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus  35s promoter, resulting in 10-ox or 11-ox, respectively . we similarly produced transgenic plants overexpressing idd <dig>  resulting in 8-ox.

we examined the flowering phenotypes of the plants grown under long days  by counting the numbers of rosette leaves at bolting and the days to bolting. the 8-ox plants and the akin10- <dig> and akin11- <dig> mutants did not exhibit any discernible flowering phenotypes under our assay conditions . in contrast, the 10-ox and 11-ox plants exhibited delayed flowering, as observed in idd8- <dig> mutant. the delay of flowering time was more prominent in 10-ox than in 11-ox . the similar flowering phenotypes raised a possibility that loss of idd <dig> function is related with overproduction of akin <dig> and akin <dig> in regulating flowering time. in support of this hypothesis, the expression of sus <dig> and suc genes was suppressed in the 10-ox plants but up-regulated in the akin10- <dig> mutant , as observed in the idd8- <dig> mutant and the 8-ox plants, respectively  <cit> .figure  <dig>

idd <dig> interacts with akin <dig> in the nucleus
on the basis of the similar flowering phenotypes of idd8- <dig> mutant and akin-overexpressing plants and the biochemical nature of idd <dig> transcription factor and snrk <dig> kinases, we hypothesized that idd <dig> interacts with the snrk <dig> kinases.

yeast two-hybrid assays did not show any positive interactions between idd <dig> and akin <dig> . we therefore employed in vitro pull-down assays using recombinant glutathione s-transferase-akin <dig>  and gst-akin <dig> fusion proteins, which were produced in e.coli cells, and 35s-labelled idd <dig> polypeptides produced by in vitro translation. while idd <dig> did not interact with gst alone, it strongly interacted with gst fusions of akin <dig> and akin <dig> . the lack of idd8-akin interactions in yeast cells might be due to an intrinsic property of akin proteins, as has been observed previously  <cit> .figure  <dig> idd <dig> interacts with akin proteins in the nucleus. a

we also performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assays to examine whether the idd8-akin interactions occur in plant cells. coexpression of the n-terminal half of yellow fluorescent protein  fused to idd <dig>  and the c-terminal half of yfp fused to akin <dig>  or akin <dig>  in arabidopsis protoplasts revealed that the idd8-akin interactions occur in the nucleus , indicating that idd <dig> interacts with akin proteins in planta.

akin <dig> phosphorylates idd8
akin <dig> and akin <dig> are the catalytic subunits of snrk <dig> kinases  <cit> . protein phosphorylation is one of the primary biochemical mechanisms that modulate the activities of transcription factors in plants  <cit> . we therefore examined whether akin proteins phosphorylate idd <dig> 

we produced recombinant maltose-binding protein-idd <dig>  and gst-akin fusion proteins in e.coli cells, which were purified by affinity chromatography and immunologically quantified . the in vitro kinase assays showed that akin <dig> possesses an autophosphorylation activity, while akin <dig> does not . it was also evident that akin <dig>  but not akin <dig>  phosphorylates idd <dig>  although both 10-ox and 11-ox plants exhibited delayed flowering  and idd <dig> interacts with both akin <dig> and akin <dig>  idd <dig> may not be directly targeted by akin <dig> at least in controlling flowering time.figure  <dig> phosphorylation of idd <dig> by akin <dig>  the in vitro phosphorylation assays were conducted using recombinant gst-akin <dig> and gst-akin <dig> fusion proteins and mbp-idd <dig> fusion protein prepared in e. coli cells . part of coomassie blue-stained gel was displayed as a loading control . kda, kilodalton.



to identify the ser and thr residues of idd <dig> targeted by akin <dig>  we searched for putative target residues using the netphos <dig> algorithm . the computer-assisted analysis identified  <dig> ser and  <dig> thr residues that were predicted to be phosphorylated by snrk <dig>  among the  <dig> residues, only the sequence contexts around thr- <dig>  ser- <dig>  and ser- <dig> partially matched to the consensus sequence established for snrk <dig> kinases  <cit>  . the three residues were mutated to alanine, resulting in t98a, s178a, and s182a , and the mutated idd <dig> proteins were prepared as mbp fusions in e. coli cells and immunologically quantified . the recombinant mbp-idd <dig> proteins were then subjected to in vitro phosphorylation assays. it was found that the phosphorylation of s182a was significantly reduced by more than 90% compared to that of wild-type idd <dig> protein . in contrast, t98a and s178a were still phosphorylated with a reduction of approximately 50%. liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry  also supported the notion that s <dig> is a major site for akin10-mediated phosphorylation .figure  <dig> identification of phosphorylation residues in idd <dig>  a predicted phosphorylation residues in idd <dig>  potential phosphorylation residues were predicted using the netphos-based analysis tool . the predicted serine  and threonine  residues were mutated to alanine . zf, zinc finger. aa, amino acid. b

akin <dig> does not affect the subcellular localization of idd8
protein phosphorylation influences diverse structural and functional aspects of transcription factors, such as protein stability, subcellular localization, and transcriptional activation activity  <cit> . it has been reported that akin <dig> regulates the protein stability of the b3-domain-containing transcription factor fusca <dig>  during lateral organ development and floral transition  <cit> . therefore, a question was how akin10-mediated phosphorylation regulates idd <dig> function in flowering time control.

we first examined whether protein phosphorylation affects the stability of idd <dig> protein using transgenic plants overexpressing idd8-myc fusion driven by the camv 35s promoter in either col- <dig> plant or akin10- <dig> mutant. the transgenic plants were incubated either in constant light or in complete darkness for  <dig> days. they were also incubated in the presence of 3-- <dig> -dimethylurea , which is a specific inhibitor of photosynthesis  <cit> , in constant light. idd <dig> proteins were then immunologically detected using an anti-myc antibody. the results showed that in the col- <dig> background, the idd <dig> levels were reduced in darkness, and the reduction was more prominent in the presence of dcmu , which is probably due to dark-induced degradation of idd <dig> protein. alternatively, the reduction would be at least in part attributable to the transcriptional suppression of idd <dig> gene by low sugar levels. notably, the patterns of idd <dig> abundance were similarly observed in akin10- <dig> background, although the overall levels were lower than those in col- <dig> background. quantitative real-time rt-pcr  showed that the levels of idd <dig> transcripts were lower in akin10- <dig> background . however, the levels of idd <dig> protein relative to those of idd <dig> transcripts were similar in col- <dig> and akin10- <dig> backgrounds . together, these observations indicate that akin <dig> does not affect the stability of idd <dig> protein.

we next examined whether akin10-mediated phosphorylation influences the subcellular localization of idd <dig> by transient expression of a green fluorescent protein -idd <dig> fusion in arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from col- <dig>  akin10- <dig>  and 10-ox plants and using transgenic plants overexpressing a gfp-idd <dig> fusion in col- <dig> and 10-ox backgrounds. the roots of the transgenic plants were visualized by fluorescence microscopy. gfp signals were detected predominantly in the nuclei of root cells of both col- <dig> and 10-ox backgrounds , indicating that the subcellular distribution of idd <dig> is not affected by akin10-mediated protein phosphorylation.

akin <dig> inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of idd8
idd <dig> binds directly to sus <dig> gene promoter containing the conserved cttttgtcc motif  <cit> . we therefore asked whether akin <dig> affects the dna-binding property of idd <dig>  we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation  assays using 35s:myc-idd <dig> and 35:myc-idd <dig> akin10- <dig> plants. idd8-binding sequence  and non-binding sequence  within the sus <dig> gene promoter were included in the assays . the assays revealed that idd <dig> does not bind to nbs sequence . in contrast, idd <dig> efficiently bound to bs sequence. notably, idd <dig> also bound efficiently to bs sequence in akin10- <dig> background, indicating that akin <dig> does not affect the dna-binding property of idd <dig> 

a remaining question was whether akin <dig> affects the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig>  to address this question, we performed transient β-galactosidase  expression assays by coexpressing a series of reporter and effecter vectors in arabidopsis protoplasts . notably, akin <dig> reduced the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig> by approximately 65% . in contrast, akin <dig> reduced the idd <dig> activity only slightly, further supporting the notion that akin <dig> is not directly related with idd <dig> figure  <dig> akin <dig> inhibits idd <dig> transcription factor activity. a reporter and effector vector constructs. a full-size idd <dig> cdna was fused in-frame to the 3′ end of gal <dig> dna-binding domain -coding sequence in the effector vector. b snrk1-mediated inhibition of idd <dig> transcriptional activation activity. gal <dig> transient expression assays were performed using arabidopsis protoplasts, as described previously  <cit> . the renilla luciferase gene was used as an internal control to normalize the values in individual assays. arf5m is a transcriptional activator control. arf1m is a transcriptional repressor control. three measurements of gus activity were averaged and statistically analyzed using student t-test . bars indicate standard error of the mean. c transcription factor activity of mutated idd <dig>  the mutated idd <dig>  harbors s178a and s182a substitutions. gus activity measurements were performed as described in . bars indicate standard error of the mean . d effects of sugar deprivation on idd <dig> transcription factor activity. the gus reporter and the idd <dig> effector vectors were cotransformed into arabidopsis protoplasts that were prepared from either col- <dig> plant or akin10- <dig> mutant . the arabidopsis protoplasts were then treated with  <dig> μm dcmu for  <dig> h before gus activity measurements. three measurements were averaged and statistically analyzed . bars indicate standard error of the mean.



the transient gus expression assays also showed that a mutated idd <dig> protein  harboring the s178a and s182a substitutions is transcriptionally active comparable to the wild-type idd <dig> protein . it was notable that whereas akin <dig> reduced the idd <dig> activity, it did not affect the midd <dig> activity, indicating that idd <dig> phosphorylation by akin <dig> is important for the suppression of the idd <dig> activity.

it is known that akin <dig> is activated under low-sugar conditions  <cit> . we therefore examined the effects of sugar deprivation on idd <dig> activity by transient gus expression assays using arabidopsis protoplasts prepared from col- <dig> plants and akin10- <dig> mutant. arabidopsis protoplasts were treated with dcmu to mimic sugar deprivation conditions before the assays. it was found that whereas dcmu detectably reduced the idd <dig> activity in col- <dig> plants, it did not affect the idd <dig> activity in akin10- <dig> mutant , demonstrating that akin <dig> suppresses idd <dig> activity under sugar deprivation conditions.

akin10-mediated phosphorylation of idd <dig> is relevant for flowering time control
our data showed that akin <dig> phosphorylates idd <dig> to reduce its transcriptional activation activity in response to sugar deprivation. we next examined whether the phosphorylation of idd <dig> by sugar deprivation-activated akin <dig> is functionally relevant for flowering time control. we crossed idd8- <dig> with akin10- <dig>  resulting in idd8- <dig> akin10- <dig> double mutant . flowering time measurements showed that the idd8- <dig> akin10- <dig> double mutant exhibited delayed flowering as observed in the idd8- <dig> mutant . what was unexpected was that the delay of flowering was more severe in the double mutant, suggesting that akin <dig> might target additional flowering time modulators other than idd <dig> .figure  <dig> flowering phenotypes and molecular characterization of idd8- <dig> akin10- <dig> double mutant. the idd8- <dig> mutant was crossed with the akin10- <dig> mutant, resulting in idd8- <dig> akin10- <dig> double mutant. a flowering phenotypes. plants were grown in soil under lds for  <dig> weeks before taking photographs . leaf numbers of  <dig> plants at bolting were averaged and statistically analyzed using the student t-test  . bars indicated standard error of the mean. b expression of flowering time genes. aerial parts of two-week-old plants grown in soil were harvested at zeitgeber time  <dig> for the extraction of total rna. transcript levels were examined by qrt-pcr. biological triplicates were averaged and statistically analyzed using student t-test . bars indicate standard error of the mean.



qrt-pcr assays on flowering time genes showed that ft gene and its downstream targets soc <dig> and appetala  <dig>  genes were suppressed in the single and double mutants , consistent with their delay flowering phenotypes. notably, the floral repressor flc was significantly induced in the idd8- <dig> akin10- <dig> mutants, which might be related with the severity of delayed flowering in the double mutant .

altogether, our data demonstrate that snrk <dig> inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig> transcription factor through protein phosphorylation to delay flowering under low-sugar conditions . this working scenario explains the suppression of idd <dig> function under sugar deprivation conditions  <cit> . we propose that the snrk1-idd <dig> signaling module provides a molecular clue for the long-lasting interest in the metabolic control of flowering in plants.figure  <dig> schematic model of akin <dig> function in flowering time control. sugar deprivation conditions, which are encountered in early vegetative phase, activate akin <dig> that negatively regulates idd <dig> transcription factor. during the reproductive phase transition, increased sugar availability deactivates akin <dig>  resulting in flowering transition. it is also likely that akin <dig> negatively regulates flc function either directly or indirectly via an unidentified regulator of flc.



discussion
in this work, we demonstrated that the serine/threonine-specific kinase snrk <dig> and its target idd <dig> transcription factor constitute a sugar metabolism-mediated flowering pathway. on the basis of molecular characterization of idd8- <dig> and akin10- <dig> mutants and transgenic plants overexpressing idd <dig> or akin <dig> genes and biochemical examination of akin10-mediated phosphorylation of idd <dig>  we suggest that the snrk <dig> pathway senses fluctuations in sugar metabolism and integrates the metabolic signals into the idd8-mediated gene regulatory network that regulates flowering time.

there has been a controversy on the molecular nature of akin10- <dig> mutant. it has been reported that the akin10- <dig> mutant is a null mutant through akin <dig> gene expression study and immunological detection of akin <dig> proteins using two-dimensional sds-page  <cit> . meanwhile, is has been shown that akin <dig> gene sequence was amplified and akin <dig> protein was detected in the akin10- <dig> mutant  <cit> . we verified that the akin <dig> gene is disrupted by the insertion of t-dna element and it is not expressed in the mutant by pcr-based genotyping and qrt-pcr using different sets of primers. we also found that sus <dig> gene expression is altered in the akin10- <dig> mutant that exhibits differential response to dcmu. we believe that akin10- <dig> is a loss-of-function mutant. the amplification of akin <dig> sequence and detection of akin <dig> protein in the previous report would be due to a high sequence similarity among akin gene members and similar sizes of akin proteins in arabidopsis.

snrk1-idd <dig> module in sugar metabolic control of flowering
floral transition is one of the most energy-consuming developmental processes in plants. therefore, it is not surprising that the timing of flowering is closely associated with sugar homeostasis. in view of metabolic control of flowering, it is notable that snrk <dig> plays a fundamental role in the developmental process in response to carbon availability  <cit> . snrk <dig> members coordinate diverse transcriptional regulatory networks that stimulate catabolism but suppress anabolism to sustain cellular energy homeostasis under stressful conditions  <cit> . while the roles of snrk <dig> members have been reported in various cellular responses, only a few substrates have been identified so far.

one of the best characterized targets is the fus <dig> transcription factor, which regulates seed maturation in arabidopsis  <cit> . it has been shown that akin10-mediated phosphorylation enhances the fus <dig> activity by improving its protein stability  <cit> . accordingly, fus <dig> is involved in the snrk1-mediated control of developmental phase transitions. molecular genetic assays have shown that the fus3- <dig> mutation partially rescued the delayed flowering of akin10-overexpressing plants  <cit> . however, the fus <dig> gene is not detectably induced during the vegetative-to-reproductive phase transition, and the flowering phenotype of the fus3- <dig> mutant is similar to that of control plants  <cit> . together with the partial recovery of the flowering phenotype of akin10-overexpressing plants by the fus3- <dig> mutation, it has been suggested that the snrk1-mediated metabolic signals are not solely mediated by fus <dig> in regulating flowering time control  <cit> .

in this study, we demonstrated that akin <dig>  which is the catalytic subunit of snrk <dig> kinases  <cit> , negatively regulates the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig> transcription factor through protein phosphorylation. while our data strongly support that idd <dig> is phosphorylated by akin <dig>  it is still possible that other kinases would also phosphorylate idd <dig>  assuming the roles of idd <dig> in sugar homeostasis and flowering time control . idd <dig> induces sus <dig> gene by directly binding to the gene promoter, leading to the promotion of photoperiodic flowering  <cit> . the idd <dig> gene is suppressed by sugar deprivation  <cit> . together with the previous observations, our data show that snrk <dig> mediates the inactivation of idd <dig> in flowering time control under low-sugar conditions. it is currently unclear whether idd <dig> is functionally connected with fus <dig> in the process of sensing sugar metabolic status by snrk <dig> 

snrk1-mediated inactivation of idd <dig> activity
protein phosphorylation influences the activity of transcription factors through diverse mechanisms, such as modulation of their nucleo-cytoplasmic distributions, dna-binding properties, and protein stabilities and modification of their interactions with other regulatory proteins  <cit> . akin <dig> does not affect the nuclear localization and dna binding of idd <dig>  the protein stability of idd <dig> is also unaffected by protein phosphorylation. instead, akin10-mediated phosphorylation inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig> 

a critical question is how protein phosphorylation affects the idd <dig> activity. we found that akin <dig> phosphorylates idd <dig> primarily at ser- <dig>  which resides in the fourth zf domain. idd <dig> has four copies of zf domains, which are known to mediate dna binding and protein-protein interactions  <cit> . it has been reported that a central amino acid sequence region of idd <dig>  which includes residues 171– <dig> and thus harbors the fourth zf domain, contains a potential transcriptional activation domain  <cit> . it has been suggested that the fourth zf domain mediates the interactions of idd transcription factors with other interacting partners in regulating the expression of target genes  <cit> . we suspect that a similar regulatory scheme is applicable to the inhibition of the idd <dig> activity by akin10: akin <dig> might inhibit the interaction of idd <dig> with other regulatory proteins by phosphorylating the critical residues in the fourth zf domain. in this regard, it will be interesting to investigate whether fus <dig> interacts with idd <dig> through the fourth zf domain.

additional roles of snrk1-idd <dig> module beyond metabolic control of flowering?
plant adaptation responses to stressful conditions, such as drought, high salinity, and extreme temperatures, frequently accompany alterations in sugar metabolism and transport  <cit> . it has been known that snrk <dig> kinases are associated with plant responses to environmental stress conditions by linking cellular energy status to stress adaptation  <cit> . it is notable that transgenic plants overexpressing akin <dig> or fus <dig> gene are sensitive to abscisic acid , a pivotal stress hormone that modulates a broad spectrum of stress responses  <cit> , and exhibit delayed seed germination  <cit> . snrk <dig> kinases have also been implicated in aging process and cell death in eukaryotes  <cit> , indicating that snrk <dig> is a central regulator of sugar metabolism in linking plant development with environmental adaptation.

the observed role of idd <dig> in the snrk1-mediated control of photoperiodic flowering under sugar starvation conditions suggest that idd <dig> function is not limited to flowering time control but might be extended to a range of stress responses. it has been observed that transgenic plants overexpressing idd <dig> gene exhibit a plethora of growth and developmental defects, such as growth retardation and architecturally distorted, pale-green leaves  <cit> . it will be worthy of examining the responses of idd8-overexpressing plants and idd8- <dig> mutant to aba and abiotic stresses and investigating whether snrk <dig> is involved in the idd8-mediated stress responses.

CONCLUSIONS
we aimed to improve our understanding on how idd <dig> perceives sugar deprivation signals in regulating photoperiodic flowering. we found that the energy metabolic sensor snrk <dig> inhibits the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig> transcription factor, which regulates photoperiodic flowering in response to sugar deprivation. akin <dig>  the α-catalytic subunit of snrk <dig> kinases, phosphorylates idd <dig> predominantly at two serine residues, ser- <dig> and ser- <dig> that reside in the fourth zf domain. while protein phosphorylation does not affect the nuclear localization and dna-binding property of idd <dig>  it significantly reduces the transcriptional activation activity of idd <dig>  the reduction of the idd <dig> activity was also observed under sugar starvation conditions, which is consistent with the activation of snrk <dig> activity by low energy status. our data show that the snrk1-idd <dig> transcriptional regulatory module serves as a web that integrates sugar metabolic signals into flowering time control in arabidopsis.
