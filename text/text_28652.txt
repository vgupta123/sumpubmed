BACKGROUND
an ever increasing number of gram-negative bacteria is known to utilize a type three secretion system , mostly pathogens that manipulate their host cells by injecting effector proteins  <cit> . one of the characteristics of t3sss is the existence of specific energy-independent chaperones which assist several of the transport substrates. chaperones assisting the effectors  are distinguished from those assisting the pore forming translocators   <cit> . the mode of interaction between class i chaperones and their respective substrates is well-investigated, mainly due to crystal structures of several chaperone/substrate complexes  <cit> . typically, a region of 50– <dig> amino acids following the putative n-terminal secretion signal is wrapped around a chaperone dimer thereby preventing tertiary structure formation of this substrate region. the rest of the substrate, however, is folded  <cit> . the chaperone/substrate complexes are recognized by a t3ss-specific atpase  <cit> , which is able to displace the chaperone from its substrate and further to act as an unfoldase unraveling the substrate  <cit> .

despite these recent discoveries, the substrate recognition process has remained enigmatic  <cit> . it has been suggested that the chaperone/substrate complexes may constitute a three-dimensional secretion signal  <cit> . this hypothesis is supported by the intriguing fact that the structures of all classi chaperones share a common fold even across the genus barrier and despite low sequence similarity.

the t3ss of pathogenic yersinia spp. is among the most intensively studied t3sss with the structures of the homodimeric chaperones syce  <cit> , sych  <cit> , syct  <cit> , and the atypical sycn/yscb heterodimer  <cit>  being solved. according to phylogenetic analyses and experimental results, the yersinia t3ss holds at least one additional classi chaperone, syco  <cit> .

here, we focus on characterization of y. enterocolitica syco, encoded by a gene termed orf <dig> until recently. in y. enterocolitica, syco is organized in an operon together with yopo  and yopp . within this operon, syco is located upstream of the yopo gene. a nonpolar deletion mutant of orf <dig>  the syco orthologue in y. pseudotuberculosis, secreted ypka and yopj in amounts comparable to the wildtype and was fully virulent. further, orf <dig> was not found to be involved in temperature and calcium-dependent control of yop expression and secretion  <cit> . because of these results and the use of the infrequent "gtg" start codon of orf <dig>  galyov et al.  <cit>  proposed that orf <dig> might not be translated. later, the corresponding orf <dig> of y. pestis was discussed as a potential syc-like chaperone due to the typical size , isoelectric point , and amphipathic character of the putative translation product  <cit> . however, in y. enterocolitica the induction of apoptosis by yopp in macrophages was shown to be independent of orf <dig>  and it was found that secretion of yopo into the culture supernatant was apparently not restricted in the absence of orf <dig>  <cit> . only recently, a chaperone function of the orf <dig> product on the effector yopo was reported. consequently, the gene product of orf <dig> was termed syco and the gene was renamed syco  <cit> .

here, we characterize recombinantly produced syco as a homodimer. we demonstrate the potential of syco to influence yop expression and secretion, and identify a novel interaction partner of syco.

RESULTS
recombinant production of syco
to examine syco in vitro, we recombinantly produced syco in e. coli and purified it to near homogeneity. for this purpose, we followed a protocol previously established for production of sych and syct to generate the proteins in their outright form without an affinity tag  <cit> . the syco sequence of y. enterocolitica strain wa- <dig>  <cit>  was amplified by pcr, thereby changing the start codon from "gtg" to "atg" to ensure maximal expression. the fragment was cloned into vector pws  <cit> . expression was performed in e. coli bl <dig>  plyss. syco was produced in abundance and its solubility was optimized by expression at 27°c overnight. a purification protocol was established combining ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by monoq-based anion exchange chromatography and a final gel filtration step. the yield was approximately  <dig> mg of purified protein per liter of culture with a homogeneity of about 95%.

recombinant syco forms homodimers
typically, t3ss effector chaperones form homodimers. in order to test syco for oligomerization, we applied analytical gel filtration and chemical cross-linking. fig. 1a depicts the sds-page analysis of a superdex <dig> gel filtration of a mixture of recombinant syco  and the monomeric marker protein carbonic anhydrase . the coomassie-stained gel of consecutive fractions shows that syco elutes before the  <dig> kda marker protein. calibration of the column revealed an apparent molecular mass of approximately  <dig> kda for syco, which is well in accordance with dimer formation. to confirm this, we performed a chemical cross-linking experiment as shown in fig.1b. the cross-linking reagent dsp generated heat-stable coupling products corresponding to syco dimers as resolved by sds-page. note that the mobility of syco in sds-page is higher than that of typical marker proteins due to its low isoelectric point of  <dig> .

overproduction of syco represses yop secretion in y. enterocolitica
it was described that overproduction of the regulatory t3ss chaperone sych in yersinia influences regulation of yop secretion and expression  <cit> . in order to test syco for possible regulatory functions, we overproduced syco in y. enterocolitica wa- <dig> and in the isogenic Δyopo and Δyopp mutant strains  <cit> . in all three strains, the overproduction of syco reduced the level of secreted yops significantly . an iptg titration series is shown in fig. 2b illustrating the correlation between an increase of syco production and a decrease of yop secretion. as an exception, the level of secreted yopo remained stable upon syco overproduction in the parental strain and in the Δyopp mutant strain as revealed by western blotting .

strikingly, analysis of the pellet fractions revealed a decrease of all yops including yopo within the cells overproducing syco . it was recently demonstrated, that secretion of yopo into the culture supernatant does not strictly rely on syco  <cit> . thus, excess of syco could increase the secretion efficiency of yopo. the finding that the amount of secreted yopo was constant despite of reduced intracellular levels suggests that yopo secretion efficiency was increased by excess of syco.

on closer inspection of yopp secretion, it became evident that deletion of yopo generated a polar effect resulting in reduced yopp secretion . interestingly, syco overproduction did not cause as pronounced a reduction of yopp secretion in the yopo mutant as in the parental strain. this observation might point to an interrelation between yopo/syco and yopp and hence to an explanation for the operon structure.

taken together, these results suggest that syco overproduction interferes with the t3ss regulatory network. strikingly, this effect is neither mediated by an interaction of syco with its effector yopo nor by an interaction with yopp which is also encoded within the same operon.

to test a possible unspecific effect of syco overproduction, we searched for a protein with similar functions and properties but unrelated to the t3ss to overproduce it as a control. we chose secb, the chaperone of the sec transport pathway, which exhibits similar properties compared to syco . overproduction of secb in the same strains did not cause any significant effect on secretion and expression of yops , suggesting a specific effect of syco towards the t3ss.

as a further control of specificity, we analyzed the influence of syco overproduction on the sec-pathway by monitoring beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to carbenicillin. we found no influence of syco overproduction on the level of carbenicillin resistance even at concentrations above  <dig> mg/ml of carbenicillin .

finally, we compared the effect of syco overproduction to that of sych overproduction . even though the overproduction of sych was very massive compared to syco  no similar effect on secretion of yops was observed . in conclusion, these findings suggest that the syco overexpression phenotype is due to a specific interaction of syco with some component of the t3ss or one involved in the t3ss regulatory network.

differential effect of syco overproduction on accumulation of yops in the yersinia cytosol in the presence of calcium ions
we further analyzed the effect of syco overproduction in the presence of  <dig> mm cacl <dig> at 37°c to detect a possible calcium-blind phenotype. we observed that none of the strains secreted yops in the presence of calcium . interestingly, syco overproduction increased the cytosolic yopo levels . an excess of syco possibly stabilizes yopo and thereby increases its half-life when no secretion takes place. in comparison, yoph levels were not significantly affected upon overproduction of syco . consequently, syco overproduction interferes with yop expression only under conditions of yop secretion.

syco interacts with the t3ss regulatory protein yscm1
several yersinia t3ss chaperones like sycd, syce, and sych are known to be involved in regulation of yop expression  <cit> . interestingly, these chaperones interact with the negative regulators of yop expression, yscm <dig>  and yscm <dig>  respectively  <cit> . yscm <dig> is only present in y. enterocolitica and paralogous to yscm <dig>  sharing 57% identical residues  <cit> . since our results suggest a regulatory function of syco, we speculated that syco might also interact with yscm <dig> and yscm <dig>  to check these interactions, we performed native gel electrophoresis as shown in fig.  <dig>  a representative coomassie-stained native gel  shows that loading a mixture of the recombinant proteins yscm <dig> and syco results in appearance of an additional band . this band does not appear when loading either yscm <dig>  or syco  alone. immunoblots developed with antisera raised against syco  and yscm <dig>  revealed that this band represents a complex composed of yscm <dig> and syco. in contrast, no interaction between yscm <dig> and syco was found . note that due to the high isoelectric point of yscm <dig>  this protein does not enter the native gel with a ph of  <dig>  <cit> .

cross-linking experiments were performed to verify the yscm1/syco interaction. however, the data did not help to interpret the results from native gel electrophoresis since yscm <dig> and syco are very similar in size and both form homodimers . as a consequence, the major cross-linking products could not be unambiguously assigned to heterocomplexes .

overproduction of syco in the yscm <dig> and yscm <dig> deletion mutants
we speculated that the effects of syco overproduction described above could be mediated by the regulatory proteins yscm <dig> and yscm <dig>  to find out whether such a connection exists, we generated deletion mutants of yscm <dig> and yscm <dig>  respectively, to use them as background for syco overproduction. deletions of yscm <dig> and yscm <dig> were generated by the red recombinase based method of datsenko and wanner  <cit>  that was adapted to y. enterocolitica  <cit> . in accordance with stainier et al.  <cit> , we found that neither the Δyscm <dig> nor the Δyscm <dig> mutant exhibited a phenotype with respect to yop expression and secretion . overall, overproduction of syco in both mutant strains caused a decrease of yop secretion  and expression  similar to what was observed for the parental strain. however, two reproducible phenomena related to the yscm <dig> deletion strain could be observed. first, syco overproduction caused a decrease of yopo secretion . in the presence of extracellular calcium, the increase of yopo levels was less pronounced in the Δyscm <dig> and also in the Δyscm <dig> strain compared to the parental strain . second, decrease of yopp secretion as a consequence of syco overproduction was more pronounced in the Δyscm <dig> strain compared to any other strain .

in summary, these results show that neither yscm <dig> nor yscm <dig> is required to establish the syco-mediated shutdown of yop expression and secretion. however, the yscm <dig> deletion mutant exhibits a phenotype suggesting that syco and yscm <dig> act together in the regulation of yopo and yopp.

discussion
in this study, we demonstrate that y. enterocolitica syco behaves as a homodimer in solution. this is in full agreement with a recent study from letzelter et al.  <cit>  who also applied gel filtration analysis and cross-linking techniques with the same outcome. homodimer formation is typical for t3ss chaperones of effectors, and syco dimerization is thus plausible in the light of the recent discovery that syco serves as a chaperone for yopo  <cit> . now, that we have established a protocol for the large-scale production of native syco we aim at generating high-resolution structural data to characterize syco on the molecular level.

we have further presented evidence that the functions of syco are not restricted to chaperoning yopo. we could show that overproduction of syco causes an apparent repression of yop secretion and expression. two principle explanations for this phenomenon seem plausible. on the one hand, syco could interfere with the regulatory network involved in yop expression, thereby causing down-regulation of yop expression and consequently reducing the amount of secreted yops. on the other hand, syco could interfere with some component of the t3ss transport machinery. in particular, t3ss chaperones are capable of interacting with the specific atpase of the transport machinery  <cit>  irrespective of effector-binding to the chaperones. thus, abundant syco could compete with chaperone/yop complexes and thereby reduce the efficiency of yop secretion. since a shutdown of secretion typically results in feedback inhibition of yop expression, this scenario could explain the phenotype equally well. this latter hypothesis is challenged by the observation that overproduction of sych in y. pestis causes a slight increase of yop expression and secretion as well as a relaxation of the calcium-dependent control of yop secretion  <cit> . similarly, moderate overproduction of sych induces yop production in y. enterocolitica and y. pseudotuberculosis  <cit> . even the dramatically elevated sych levels that we applied could not provoke an effect comparable to that of syco. therefore, an interference of syco with the yop regulatory network is a more likely explanation. since yopo and yopp proved to be dispensable for mediating the effect caused by syco overproduction, we speculated on a role of the yop regulatory proteins yscm <dig> and yscm <dig> in this context. clearly, neither yscm <dig> nor yscm <dig> was required to establish the syco phenotype. presumably, at least one further interaction partner of syco has to be identified. this will help to understand whether syco overexpression acts at the level of transcription or translation.

nevertheless, we could demonstrate an interaction between yscm <dig> and syco in vitro. in support of such an interaction, overproduction of syco in the yscm <dig> deletion strain influenced yopo and yopp secretion and intracellular accumulation of yopo. the yscm proteins are involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of yop expression. in addition, they are t3s substrates themselves and chaperoned by sych, another actor in the yop expression network  <cit> . recently, binding of syce to yscm <dig> and yscm <dig>  and binding of sycd to yscm <dig> was demonstrated  <cit> . what could be the meaning of this yscm promiscuity? an unspecific interaction of both yscm <dig> and yscm <dig> with the acidic t3ss chaperones seems unlikely, given that the isoelectric point of yscm <dig> is  <dig>  whereas the pi of yscm <dig> is  <dig> . we propose that the yscm proteins function as an interface, integrating information on whether t3ss chaperones are loaded with yops, and transducing these signals into repression or derepression of yop translation.

CONCLUSIONS
this study supports the recently established view that syco is a typical t3ss chaperone of class i that increases solubility and secretion efficiency of the effector yopo  <cit> . beyond that, our results suggest that syco is part of the t3ss regulatory network. this finding highlights the need for a complete t3ss interactome to understand the complex t3ss machinery.
