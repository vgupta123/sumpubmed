BACKGROUND
males and females share many traits and these are controlled by a common genetic programme  <cit> . however, the sexes are frequently subjected to sex-specific selection for shared traits  and this can generate intralocus sexual conflict . this conflict is pervasive , occurring whenever males and females differ in their optimal values for shared traits  <cit> . human hip-width is a putative example of sexual conflict over trait values, with wider hips favoured in females to accommodate child birth, but disfavoured in males because of mobility costs  <cit> . intralocus sexual conflict has been promoted as a mechanism for maintaining genetic variation  <cit> , although this is controversial as the theoretical conditions required are restrictive . additionally, there has been no empirical test of this possibility for naturally occurring alleles  <cit>  because definitive sexually-antagonistic allelic variation has never been precisely identified. in fact it has been argued that it will be very difficult to map sexually antagonistic traits to single genes  <cit> .

an emerging exception to this generalisation is the drosophila melanogaster ddt resistance allele  of the gene cyp6g <dig>  <cit> , for which we recently documented sexually antagonistic selection on a canton-s genetic background  <cit> . ddt-r increases female fecundity and survival of their offspring  <cit> , even in the absence of ddt , but decreases male fitness  <cit> . the finding of sexual antagonism in this background is important because canton-s was isolated prior to the widespread use of ddt  <cit>  and near fixation of ddt-r  <cit> . as a result, there cannot have been ddt-r/canton-s-background coevolution to ameliorate the male costs ddt-r generates  <cit> . put another way, selection should favour modifiers that reduce the negative fitness effects of ddt-r on males, but the canton-s background should largely retain the primordial condition as there has been no coevolution between it and ddt-r. importantly, this sexual antagonism potentially resolves a troubling paradox - while the resistance allele was present before the use of ddt, it was not until after ddt use that the allele increased in frequency  <cit> , despite large fitness benefits for female carriers  <cit> . the intralocus conflict we previously documented  <cit>  provides one potential explanation for this pattern: in the absence of pesticide, ddt-r increases female fitness, but simultaneously decreases male fitness. thus, the sexual antagonism hypothesis could explain why variation was maintained at the ddt-r locus and why ddt-r did not fix despite its female benefits, but this remains to be tested.

here we present a population genetic model of d. melanogaster ddt-r that incorporates the sex-specific fitness effects previously documented in the canton-s background  <cit> , and used this theory to examine the maintenance of genetic variation over parameter values derived from previous empirical work  <cit> . previous models of this nature have not been based on directly quantified measures of male and female fitness at antagonistic loci , unlike here. our model assumes that ddt-r increases egg and larval survival through a dominant maternal effect, for which there is evidence  <cit> . this means that the standard diploid population genetics models of sexual antagonism must be modified. also, we assume a direct dominant effect of the ddt-r allele on increasing the pupal survival of both sexes, of reducing the mating success of males, and of increasing the fecundity of females. this assumption is based on the evidence for dominance in ddt resistance  <cit>  and various pleiotropic fitness measures  <cit> .

theoretical predictions were then tested in replicate experimentally evolving fly populations to empirically address whether sexual conflict can maintain genetic variation at a known, naturally occurring, sexually antagonistic allele , and whether this might explain the evolutionary history of this allele.

RESULTS
by inserting fitness estimates  <cit>  into a non-linear recursion model we generated predictions of allele frequency dynamics over time. the model terms with default parameter values are outlined in table  <dig>  the model yields at least two solutions  and, under certain fitness parameter values a third, internal equilibrium . it can be shown that for a stable internal equilibrium to exist the following inequalities must be true:table  <dig> model terms

the stability of each boundary equilibrium also depends on these inequalities .fig.  <dig> the theoretical allele frequencies with and without ddt imposed selection.  the model parameter space showing three different equilibrium regions. if the upper surface is exceeded ddt-r goes to fixation. below the lower surface ddt-r cannot invade. a stable internal equilibrium, where both resistant and susceptible genotypes co-occur, exists in the envelope between the two surfaces.  model ddt-r genotype and allele trajectories approach a stable internal equilibrium. model run over  <dig> generations with fitness parameters at default canton-s values .  and : initial genotype frequencies x

if inequality  is reversed, then the lower boundary equilibrium is stable and ddt-r cannot invade a susceptible population. correspondingly, if inequality  is reversed, then the upper boundary equilibrium is stable and ddt-r at any initial frequency will go to fixation .

if inequalities  and  are true, explicit solutions for all internal equilibria can be found . it can then be shown that the stable internal equilibrium occurs at genotype frequencies x^rr= <dig> ,x^rs= <dig> ,x^ss= <dig> , where subscripts refer to resistance  and susceptible . this is globally stable, so regardless of the starting frequency , the ddt-r allele frequency will go to a stable equilibrium of  <dig> % in the absence of ddt . an initially high frequency mirrors the current situation in the wild where ddt-r has reached near fixation in many global populations  <cit> .

it takes considerably longer to reach equilibrium when starting from high ddt-r frequency when compared to an initially low ddt-r frequency  – this demonstrates that it is far easier for the resistance allele to invade a susceptible population than for the susceptible allele to invade a resistant population. the asymmetry is a direct result of the frequency-dependent selection acting on males. thus, in a population with very low background ddt-r frequency, a resistant male does much worse than he would in a population with very high background ddt-r frequency because of the higher number of encounters with competitively superior ss males.

when simulating selection from ddt, the added viability advantage to ddt-r  <cit>  rapidly pushes the allele towards fixation . as long as complete fixation is not achieved, removal of pesticide selection allows a return to the internal equilibrium, but at a very slow rate – it takes more than  <dig> generations for this to occur. if we assume  weaker sexually antagonistic selection on the allele, ddt-r is still kept at an allelic frequency of about  <dig>  in the absence of ddt, until ddt drives it to near fixation .

by using empirically derived estimates of male and female fitness to quantify the magnitude of intralocus sexual conflict at this locus  <cit> , we find that polymorphism in resistance is maintained over a wide range of values, which contrasts with previous models  where genetic variation was maintained only in limited parameter range. this difference is attributable to previous models utilising very small selection coefficients, whereas here, we have documented sexually antagonistic selection at the allele and found it to be orders of magnitude stronger than previously assumed. that is, relaxation of the assumption of weak selection found in previous generalised models of intralocus sexual conflict make the conditions for stable polymorphism less restrictive.

to test model predictions, we established replicate, experimental fly populations with different initial ddt-r allele frequencies, some at hardy-weinberg equilibrium and some not. this was to ensure that starting frequencies covered multiple initial conditions, enabling us to critically assess theoretical outcomes empirically over a broad range of starting assumptions. based on the theoretical expectation of  <dig> % ddt-r at equilibrium in the absence of ddt , ddt-r frequency should increase in low initial-frequency experimental populations  and decrease in medium , and high  initial-frequency populations , and should also fall in the nhw populations .

we found that ddt-r frequency increased in seven of eight lf populations, and decreased in mf and hf populations as predicted . additionally, five of the six nhw populations behaved as expected . this means that  <dig> of the  <dig> populations experienced a shift in allele frequency in the expected direction, qualitatively matching theoretical predictions  even though the natural populations are vastly more complicated than our model.fig.  <dig> comparison of model predictions with experimental data for canton-s populations.  comparison of final ddt-r frequencies from experimental populations  and nhw, with initial and model prediction frequencies. empirical data  is presented as mean frequency with standard error bars. low, mid, high population data are for generation  <dig> while nhw population data are for generation  <dig>   comparison of nhw canon-s population cage allele trajectories with model predictions. black lines represent ddt-r allele frequencies over  <dig> generations. all six population cages started at x

using t-tests of logit-transformed frequency data, there were no significant differences between our observed data and model predictions for the mf , hf  and nhw  populations  at the termination of each experiment. however, the final frequencies in the lf populations were significantly lower than predicted . this lf deviation could be due to at least two related factors. first, experimental populations were held at higher density than the original assays used to derive the different fitness parameters  <cit> . second, we modelled the relative competitive mating success of ddt-r males based on trials in which two males compete for access to one female  <cit> . it is far from certain that mating probabilities will be the same at different genotype ratios and densities  <cit> .

it is also important to note that the introgression of ddt-r into our experimental canton-s flies involved a relatively small number of backcross generations, so that a substantial tract  of genetic material will be derived from the hikone-r stock and this could account for some of the variability in behaviour in the experiments. our populations and allele frequency estimation also includes stochastic sampling that is not modelled. nonetheless, in spite of these differences, there was general agreement between theoretical expectation and experimental data and regardless of whether we start at high or low allele frequency, and whether these are started in hardy-weinberg or not, populations tend to behave as predicted.

CONCLUSIONS
we show that sexually antagonistic selection is theoretically able to maintain genetic variation at the cyp6g <dig> locus, and these findings were confirmed in experimental fly populations. to date, only one other study has characterised the evolutionary dynamics of a specific sexually antagonistic allele  <cit> . that study similarly found that sexual antagonism was able to maintain genetic variation at the antagonistic locus. however, that was an artificial experimentally constructed allele, whereas in our study, we examined the impact of sexually antagonistic selection on a naturally occurring resistance allele.

at present the negative effects of ddt-r on male fitness have only been seen on one of two genetic backgrounds examined   <cit> . however, as we show here, in principle, sexual antagonism could maintain genetic variation at the locus. furthermore, and as noted above, the canton-s background has not coevolved with ddt-r, so we can observe the consequences of intralocus conflict before potential modifiers evolve to offset negative fitness effects  <cit> .

our results have important consequences for the maintenance of genetic variation generally, as intralocus conflict is ubiquitous  <cit>  and conflict resolution is difficult  <cit> . we have assumed complete dominance of ddt-r , but sex-specific dominance patterns need further investigation as they can have major impact on the genetic architecture of intralocus conflict and may provide an additional avenue through which genetic variation can be maintained  <cit> .

our findings could also broadly explain the historical ddt-r allele frequency patterns seen in nature and therefore provides the first unifying explanation for a range of somewhat discordant information on ddt-r . this has important implications for applied aspects of resistance, including insect pest management, and shows the potential of insect resistance systems to shed light on fundamental questions of evolutionary dynamics. finally, we show that identifying naturally occurring sexually antagonistic alleles, and estimating selection on them is possible, despite the difficulty associated with mapping sexually antagonistic traits to specific genes  <cit> .
