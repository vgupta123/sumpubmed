BACKGROUND
the class i phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  signaling pathway comprises a series of serine/threonine kinase cascades that regulate a variety of cellular processes including cell cycle progression, cell survival and migration, and protein synthesis. recent evidence supports the hypothesis that the dysregulation of class i pi3k signaling promotes tumourigenesis and angiogenesis in various cancer types 
 <cit> .

class i pi3k is predominantly activated by receptor tyrosine kinases  upon receiving growth factor stimulation. the activated rtks undergo either autophosphorylation of tyrosine  residues at the intracellular domains or phosphorylation of their substrates such as irs- <dig>  irs- <dig> and gab on y residues. the phosphorylated y residues are soon recognized by sh <dig> domains in p <dig> regulatory subunit of class i pi3k, recruiting class i pi3k to plasma membrane, triggering activation of pi3k downstream pathways . alternatively, class i pi3ks can be activated through the interaction between p <dig> catalytic subunit and ras following rtk activation 
 <cit> . the activated class i pi3k can convert phosphatidylinositol- <dig> –biphosphate  to phosphatidylinositol- <dig> ,5–triphosphate , resulting in the recruitment of akt to the plasma membrane and allowing phosphatidylinositol 3-dependent kinase  <dig>  to phosphorylate and activate akt. in contrast, akt activity can be counteracted by phosphatase and tensin homolog  tumour suppressor through conversion of pip <dig> back to pip <dig> .

the class i pi3k effects cellular functions through its two major downstream effectors akt and mtor. akt can phosphorylate foxo3a, bax, bad, and caspase  <dig> to antagonize apoptotic activity, 
 <cit>  phosphorylate pro-survival factors such as mdm <dig> and ikk-α to maintain cell survival, 
 <cit>  phosphorylate mitochondrial hexokinase-ii to prevent mitochondria from initiation of apoptosis, 
 <cit>  phosphorylate gsk <dig> and cell cycle inhibitors p21waf <dig> and p27kip to promote g1/s cell cycle progression, 
 <cit>  phosphorylate tuberous sclerosis complex  <dig>  or pras <dig> to trigger mtor complex  <dig> -mediated protein synthesis, 
 <cit>  and phosphorylate telomerase reverse transcriptase  to increase cell longevity 
 <cit> .

the mtor kinase acts as an akt substrate when mtor binds to raptor to form mtorc <dig>  but mtor can become an akt upstream activator when mtor binds to rictor to form mtor complex  <dig>   mtorc <dig> promotes protein synthesis through activation of its two downstream pathways: p70s <dig> kinase /s <dig> ribosomal protein  pathway triggers translation of 5' terminal oligopolypyrimidine  mrnas encoding ribosomal proteins and elongation factors and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4e -binding protein  <dig> /eif4e pathway initiates cap-dependent translation 
 <cit> . accumulating evidence shows that regulation of eif4e activity is a two-step mechanism. initially, active mtorc1/4ebp <dig> signaling causes dissociation of eif4e from 4ebp <dig> binding, which in turn allows erk and/or p <dig> mapk-mediated mnk <dig> and mnk <dig> to phosphorylate eif4e on ser <dig>  consequently facilitating eif4e to enter the eif4f complex and triggering cap-dependent translation 
 <cit> . the cap-dependent translation can synthesize proteins promoting cell growth  and neovascularization  and some malignant behaviours associated with tumour progression   .

it has been reported that a variety of molecular alterations in any component of the pi3k pathway and its upstream signals can lead to constitutive activation of pi3k kinase cascades. this includes mutations identified in genes encoding rtks such as mutant kit-driven human and canine mast cell tumours and mutant flt3-driven leukemia 
 <cit> . mutations of k-ras and n-ras genes have been documented in canine lung cancer and canine leukemia respectively 
 <cit> . aberrant expression of class i pi3k subunits, such as amplification of pik3ca and mutation of pik3r <dig>  is commonly found in colon cancer 
 <cit> . high frequency of pten mutation has been reported in malignant glioblastoma 
 <cit> . in addition, post-translational modification of pten, leading to down-regulation of pten activity, has been described in t cell leukemia 
 <cit> . alterations of three akt isoforms, including amplification of akt <dig>  somatic  mutations of akt <dig> amplification of akt <dig>  overexpression of akt <dig> without evidence of akt <dig> amplification, overexpression of akt <dig> mrna and protein but lack evidence of akt <dig> amplification, and somatic  mutations of akt <dig> have been reported in a wide range of tumour types 
 <cit> .

in this study, we examined the importance of the class i pi3k/akt pathway in promoting tumourigenicity of canine cell lines by utilizing small molecules zstk <dig>  kp372- <dig> and rapamycin that selectively inhibit class i pi3k, akt and mtor, respectively. canine lines were treated with these inhibitors and cell survival determined by celltiter-glo assays and annexin v/pi staining, whilst activation of pi3k/akt/mtor components were detected by western blotting. this paper demonstrates that class i pi3k/akt signaling is critical for the viability of all canine cancer cell lines studied. in particular, akt-mediated anti-apoptotic activity was found to be critical for maintaining cell viability. furthermore, we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of class i pi3k and mtor may offer a better therapeutic approach for canine cancer therapy than the concomitant treatment of the pi3k pathway in combination with conventional cancer cytotoxic drugs.

RESULTS
class i pi3k signaling is activated in canine cancer cells
to determine the extent of class i pi3k kinase pathway activation in these five canine tumour cell lines, we employed western blot analysis to examine the presence of active  forms of several components of the class i pi3k pathway, including phosphorylated akt, mtor, s6rp, 4ebp <dig> and eif4e. in addition to these canine cell lines, the human jurkat t leukemic cell line was used as control as the cell line has constitutive activation of class i pi3k signaling through pten loss 
 <cit> . as shown in figure 
 <dig>  all canine lines with either pten expression  or pten loss  expressed detectable levels of active forms of these proteins, indicating active class i pi3k signaling in these canine cells.

because accumulating evidence suggests cross-talk between class i pi3k and ras/raf/erk mapk pathways commonly occurs , we explored the activity of the erk/mapk pathway in these canine cells. our western blot results demonstrated that these canine cells expressed detectable levels of active forms  of erk1/ <dig>  indicating ras/erk mapk signaling is also activated in these canine cells. however, this was not detected in the human jurkat cell line and very low in the canine c <dig> cell line .

inhibition of class i pi3k/akt/mtor signaling significantly decreases the viability of canine cancer cell lines
to investigate the potential role of class i pi3k signaling in canine cell lines, we used specific chemical inhibitors to block pathway components. inhibitors used were zstk <dig>  kp372- <dig> and rapamycin, which targeted pan-class i pi3ks, akt and mtor respectively. subsequently, we compared cell viability of drug-treated cells with those of vehicle-treated cells by using a standard cell viability assay. while we recognize that colony-forming assays represent a more robust method for measuring responses to anti-cancer agents, this would have been impractical for such a large-scale cell study. as shown in figure 
3a, zstk <dig> at concentrations between  <dig> nm and  <dig> μm exhibited a remarkable decline in cell viability by ≥74% with almost full inhibition in sb  and in jurkat t cells . however, the effect of this drug at concentrations between  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm appears to plateau in j3t, c <dig> and  <dig> cells with no further inhibition in rem and sb cells. in this study, kp372- <dig> showed its efficient inhibition effects on all cell lines causing 100% loss in cell viability after incubation with this compound at the concentrations of ≥  <dig> nm for  <dig> days, compared with zstk <dig> and rapamycin which required a longer period of time  and much higher doses  to reach effective inhibition . notably, rem cells were most sensitive to kp372- <dig> with full inhibition of cell viability at the concentration of ≥  <dig>  nm.

with regard to rapamycin, it was observed that the doses within a nanomolar range had limited effects on inhibiting the viability of these canine cells. jurkat t cells were observed to be most sensitive to rapamycin  of viability ~ 1nm) whereas all canine cancer cell lines were relatively resistant to rapamycin and the ic <dig> values for canine  <dig>  c <dig>  sb, rem and j3t cells were  <dig> μm, 1- <dig> μm,  <dig> μm, 10- <dig> μm and >  <dig> μm, respectively. among all lines, canine j3t and rem cells were most resistant to rapamycin. the doses for rapamycin to reach full inhibition of all lines were between  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm . the concentrations required to inhibit the target via western blot analysis correlated well with those to cause cell killing via the viability assay.

the class i pi3k/akt/mtor inhibitors abrogate activity of class i pi3k signaling
to study the inhibitory effects of zstk <dig>  kp372- <dig> and rapamycin on the class i pi3k/akt/mtor axis signaling in canine cells, we performed western blot analysis to evaluate expression levels of active  forms of class i pi3k downstream effectors, including akt, s6rp, 4ebp <dig> and eif4e.

western blot analysis demonstrated that zstk <dig> down-regulated phosphorylation of akt and mtor downstream targets s6rp and 4ebp <dig>  however, there was no change in phosphorylation of eif4e . kp372- <dig>  at the concentration of  <dig> nm, down-regulated phosphorylation levels of s6rp and 4ebp <dig> in all lines and eif4e in j3t and rem cells. however, this inhibitor was observed to up-regulate phosphorylation levels of eif4e in jurkat t cells . rapamycin inhibited mtorc <dig> signaling, based on decreased γ hyper-phosphorylation of 4ebp <dig> and phosphorylation of s6rp. but up-regulation of eif4e phosphorylation was observed in human jurkat t cells upon rapamycin treatment .

to dissect the dynamics of inhibition further, we performed a time-course study utilizing the c <dig> cell line only. as shown in figure 
5a, zstk <dig> and wortmannin, both of which are inhibitors targeting all isoforms of p <dig> subunits of class i pi3k, blocked class i pi3k activity, as evidenced by significant reduction in phosphorylation levels of akt and its downstream substrates s6rp and the γ hyper-phosphorylated form of 4ebp <dig> in c <dig> cells. however, compared with wortmannin, zstk <dig> showed greater potency and greater duration of activity in down-regulating class i pi3k kinase signaling. this was based on the results showing that inhibition of phosphorylation of downstream elements of class i pi3k by zstk <dig> lasted for  <dig> hrs whereas wortmannin lasted for  <dig> hrs . the efficacy of rapamycin in inhibiting mtorc <dig> signaling lasted for  <dig> hrs, as indicated by decreasing phosphorylation levels of s6rp and γ hyper-phosphorylation form of 4ebp <dig>  this is consistent with previous studies suggesting that the efficacy of rapamycin can last for ~ <dig> days 
 <cit> .

for the time course study of kp372- <dig> in c <dig> cells, three doses higher than the inhibitory concentration of 100% cell viability , including  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> nm, were tested. at the highest dose , the phosphorylation levels of pi3k/akt substrates s6rp and 4ebp <dig> were decreased at  <dig> hrs. however, at  <dig> and  <dig> hours, this dose demonstrated profound inhibition of phosphorylation of all pi3k downstream substrates, including akt, s6rp, 4ebp <dig> and eif4e, . kp372- <dig> at concentrations between  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm showed no inhibitory effects on class i pi3k activity at the early time points of  <dig> and  <dig> hrs but gradually down-regulated all of its downstream components at later time points of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs . however, data of c <dig> cells treated with  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm kp372- <dig> at later time points  <dig> and  <dig> hrs were unavailable .

effects of class i pi3k/akt/mtor inhibitors on cell apoptosis
to determine whether the three class i pi3k pathway inhibitors zstk <dig>  kp372- <dig> and rapamycin induce apoptosis in these canine lines, cells were stained with annexin v, a cell apoptosis marker, and propidium iodide , followed by flow cytometry analysis. the results demonstrated that zstk <dig> significantly increased apoptosis of jurkat t, c <dig> and sb cells by 32%, 24% and 19%, respectively, as compared with the controls . conversely,  <dig>  j3t and rem cells were not affected by zstk <dig> treatment and the increased apoptosis rate was below 6%. by contrast, kp372- <dig> was shown to be a potent inducer of apoptosis causing > 87% cell loss in most cell lines and 60% loss of sb cells at the concentration of  <dig> nm for  <dig> day. since rapamycin at  <dig> μm was observed to fully inhibit the viability of most cell lines, except rem and j3t cells whose viability rates were reduced by 65% and 48% respectively , it raised the question whether rapamycin at such a high dose  could down-regulated cell viability through triggering apoptosis. as shown in figure 
6b, apoptotic rates were significantly increased by  <dig> μm rapamycin in all lines except j3t cells which was not affected by this drug treatment regime.

additive or synergistic inhibitory effects on cell viability when zstk <dig> and rapamycin were combined
we have demonstrated that rapamycin inhibited canine cell lines with ic <dig> values of between  <dig> and >  <dig> μm . notably,  <dig> μm is higher than the recommended concentration of rapamycin or rapalogues that are currently utilized to treat human  and canine cancer patients  due to the drug-related toxicity observed in human patients 
 <cit> . to investigate whether concurrent inhibition of two other pathway components could improve the efficiency of rapamycin, cells were concomitantly treated with zstk <dig> and rapamycin.

the inhibitory effect of drug combinations on cell viability was evaluated using the bliss additivism model 
 <cit> . briefly, if the cell viability rates generated by bliss additivism model analysis were higher than, overlapped with, or lower than those rates obtained from experimental results, it was assumed that the combination had a synergistic, additive, or antagonistic effect, respectively. as shown in figure 
7a, the bliss analyses showed that zstk <dig> combined with rapamycin had an additive effect on most lines and even a synergistic effect on j3t cells. in this study, this drug combination demonstrated an increased efficacy of: 8-22% in jurkat, 16-23% in  <dig>  7-22% in sb, 0-10% in rem, 23-36% in j3t and 13-29% in c <dig>  as compared with either rapamycin or zstk <dig> alone, depending on which single agent achieved maximal inhibition of cell viability. notably, canine j3t cells, as mentioned earlier , were most resistant to rapamycin but showed synergistic response to the drug combination, suggesting that class i pi3k/akt signaling may be activating a cell survival pathway other than mtor.

further, western blot analysis, demonstrated that zstk <dig> alone or in combination with rapamycin significantly decreased the levels of phospho -akt in most cell lines but moderately decreased p-akt in c <dig> cells . p-akt levels in jurkat t cells were decreased by rapamycin after incubation for a longer time period . similar effects of rapamycin on jurkat t cells and other cell lines after exposure for  <dig> hrs, have been described in previous studies 
 <cit> . it was observed that the drug combination profoundly inhibited the levels of p-4ebp <dig> but not p-s6rp as compared with each drug alone. however, full inhibition of p-4ebp <dig> did not contribute to down-regulation of p-eif4e. in jurkat t cells, rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of eif4e was observed to be repressed by co-treatment of rapamycin in combination with zstk <dig> 

effects of the combination of the class i pi3k/akt/mtor pathway inhibitors and doxorubicin on sb and rem cells
to investigate the impact of inhibition of pi3k/akt/mtor axis pathway on the chemosensitivity of canine tumours, we evaluated the effects of the combination of the class i pi3k pathway inhibitors and doxorubicin on the viability of canine sb and rem cells and utilized the bliss additivism model to analyze the effects. as shown in figure 
 <dig>  the bliss analysis showed that zstk <dig> antagonized the cytotoxic effects of doxorubicin in both cell lines. kp372- <dig> highly synergized with the cytotoxic action of doxorubicin in sb cells with an increase in efficacy of 13-43%, as compared with treatment with kp372- <dig> alone. there was antagonism between the actions of kp372- <dig> with doxorubicin in rem cells. rapamycin was observed to enhance doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines in an additive manner with an increase in efficacy of 2-23% in sb cells and 2-13% in rem cells as compared with either rapamycin or doxorubicin alone.

discussion
in the present study, we demonstrate that human and canine cancer cell lines express constitutively activated class i pi3k/akt/mtorc <dig> axis signaling, as evidenced by detectable levels of phosphorylated forms of pi3k downstream effectors, including akt, mtor, s6rp, 4ebp <dig> and eif4e. subsequently, we inhibited the class i pi3k pathway at different levels by utilizing small molecules inhibitors zstk <dig>  kp372- <dig> or rapamycin to specifically target pan-class i pi3k, akt and mtor respectively. previous studies have demonstrated zstk <dig> to have ~ <dig>  ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig> fold specific inhibition for class i pi3kα over class ii pi3k-c2β, mtor and dna-dependent protein kinase , respectively 
 <cit> . moreover, this inhibitor is reported to have weak or no inhibitory effects on activities of class ii pi3k-c2α, class iii pi3k, and pi4k. in addition, zstk <dig> did not down-regulate phosphorylation of erk and activities of several components of mapk pathway 
 <cit> . therefore, our results suggest that the viability of the cell lines tested is, in part class i pi3k-dependent. however, we also observe that zstk <dig> fails to fully inhibit cell viability in most canine cell lines, suggesting the existence of another mechanism for cell survival. the active erk signaling detected in these canine cells may play a role in resistance to pi3k pathway inhibition.

western blot analysis demonstrated that zstk <dig> inhibits the class i pi3k/akt/mtor axis signaling. analysis of apoptosis revealed that zstk <dig> is less potent at apoptosis induction than kp372- <dig> or rapamycin, suggesting that zstk <dig> does not inhibit cell viability entirely through induction of apoptosis. a recent study of human cancer cell lines showed that zstk <dig> has potent effects on arrest of cell cycle progression through inhibition of phosphorylation or expression of akt and/or mtorc <dig> substrates, such as p-gsk3β, p-mtor, p-p70s6k and cyclin d <dig>  however, ability to induce apoptosis is cell line dependent and is considered, in general, a weak inducer of apoptosis 
 <cit> . our study suggests that class i pi3k is critical to the viability of cancer cell lines but implicates the mechanism of zstk <dig> to be through inhibition of akt/mtorc1-mediated protein synthesis and cell growth rather than apoptosis induction.

in this study, kp372- <dig> is observed to be the most potent drug to down-regulate cell viability, indicating the critical role for akt in these cell lines. western blot analysis demonstrated that high doses or long drug exposure of kp372- <dig> is required to inhibit akt/mtorc <dig> signaling compared to zstk <dig> and rapamycin. however, kp372- <dig> showed remarkable efficacy for inducing apoptosis. a previous study of kp372- <dig> on acute myelognous leukemia  suggests that this drug predominantly acts on inhibition of pdk1/akt-mediated anti-apoptosis mechanism but has no function on arresting cell cycle progression 
 <cit> . in agreement with this study, our data suggests that kp372- <dig> is a potent inducer of apoptosis through down-regulation of akt-mediated survival mechanism but has less effect on inhibition of akt/mtorc1-mediated activities such as protein synthesis and cell cycle progression. in addition, as rem cells are highly sensitive to kp372- <dig> but relatively resistant to rapamycin, it is suggested that akt-mediated anti-apoptosis activity, not mtorc <dig> activity, is critical for the viability of rem cells. in the time course study of c <dig> cells, we find that kp372- <dig> at  <dig> nm initially down-regulates phosphorylation of mtorc <dig> substrates s6rp and 4ebp <dig>  and then gradually down-regulates phosphorylation of akt and eif4e. we show that  <dig> nm kp372- <dig> induces most c <dig> cells to apoptosis after  <dig> hours of incubation, indicating the correlation of protein loss with apoptosis. the down-regulated phosphorylation of akt and eif4e may be a late event of de-phosphorylation of all protein kinases when most cells undergo apoptosis. in addition to c <dig> cells, decreased phosphorylation of all class i pi3k substrates is also observed in kp372- <dig> treated rem and j3t cells.

the effects of rapamycin on the viability of canine cells tested in this study and the apoptosis results are in agreement with previous findings that higher doses  of cci- <dig> or rapamycin can overcome drug resistance mechanism and achieve full inhibition of cell proliferation through the inhibition of mtorc2-mediated akt and erk survival pathways and the profound inhibition of global protein synthesis 
 <cit> . accumulating evidence suggest that rapamycin at lower doses  requires initial interaction with cytoplasmic receptor fkbp <dig>  which in turn allows rapamycin to bind mtorc <dig>  leading to inhibition of mtorc <dig> pathway but also generation of drug resistance 
 <cit> . so far, at least three mechanisms have been reported to be associated with rapamycin-resistance and all of them are linked to mtorc <dig> inhibition. first route is through inhibition of mtorc1/p70s6k, which in turn releases the feedback loop of p70s6k/irs-1/pi3k/ras and stimulates ras/erk mapk and pi3k/akt pathways 
 <cit> . the second route is through inhibition of mtorc <dig>  which in turn activates expression of insulin-like growth factor- <dig>  and irs- <dig>  followed by activation of igf-1/igf- <dig> rtk/irs-2/pi3k with a consequence of activation of the pi3k/akt pathway 
 <cit> . the third route is through mtorc <dig> inhibition, followed by activation of the c-src/rtk pathway and subsequent activation of the ras/erk mapk pathway 
 <cit> . our western blot data show that low doses  of rapamycin inhibits mtorc <dig> signaling but stimulates phosphorylation of eif4e in jurkat t cells. as eif4e phosphorylation is under the control of erk and/or p <dig> mapk pathways following mtorc1-mediated dissociation from 4ebp <dig>  it is suggested that rapamycin at the low dose stimulates erk or p38mapk/mnk/eif4e pathway in jurkat t cells through any of the three rapamycin-resistance mechanisms described above 
 <cit> . indeed, a previous study of a pim inhibitor has demonstrated that inhibition of p70s6k activity in jurkat t cells triggers a p70s6k/irs- <dig> feedback loop and activates ras/mapk signaling 
 <cit> . in this study, we find that both rapamycin and kp372- <dig> significantly increase phosphorylation of eif4e in this cell line and the rapamycin-induced phosphorylation of eif4e in jurkat t cells is suppressed by rapamycin in combination with zstk <dig>  another study has reported that rapamycin-induced eif4e phosphorylation can be reversed by the combination of rapamycin and a pi3k inhibitor but, in certain cell lines, pi3k inhibitor alone can still increases eif4e phosphorylation 
 <cit> . this suggests that tumour cells can escape cell death through additional mechanisms other than the p70s6k/irs-1/pi3k/ras feedback loop. due to simultaneous inhibition of both class i pi3k and mtorc <dig> reversing rapamycin-induced eif4e hyper-phosphorylation, it is suggested that jurkat t cells are resistant to rapamycin through either activating the p70s6k/irs-1/pi3k/ras or igf-1/igf- <dig> rtk/irs-2/pi3k pathways, but not through the third resistant mechanism that is the c-src/rtk pathway 
 <cit> .

by contrast, rapamycin at higher doses  directly binds to mtor, which in turn inhibits mtorc <dig> and global translation processes, leading to a dramatic decline in cell viability 
 <cit> . a recent study shows that inhibition of mtorc <dig> by silencing expression of the rictor subunit can not only down-regulate akt signaling but can also down-regulate erk phosphorylation 
 <cit> . in this study, we have shown that rapamycin at a high dose such as  <dig> μm significantly increases apoptotic rates of most cell lines, confirming that reduction of cell viability was in part through apoptosis. hence, our data support previous findings that high doses of rapamycin decrease global translation processes and down-regulate mtorc <dig> activity 
 <cit> . notably, mtorc <dig> has recently been identified as activators of not only akt survival kinase but also serum- and glucocorticoid-induced protein kinase , a pro-survival factor, and protein kinase c  
 <cit> . this implicates a role of mtorc <dig> in promoting survival of these canine cancer cell lines tested in the present study.

it is suggested that the mechanism for the additive or synergistic effects of zstk <dig> and rapamycin on cells is through simultaneous inhibition of akt activity and inhibition of mtorc <dig> activity. however, this drug combination has no effects on eif4e phosphorylation, in agreement with previous findings that eif4e phosphorylation is regulated by erk or/and p38mapk pathways. interestingly, we observed that this drug combination does not profoundly inhibit phosphorylation of s6rp in most canine cells except c <dig> cells. as s6rp has been reported to have three upstream activators, which are pdk1/p70s6k, mtorc1/p70s6k and ras/erk/rsk pathways, it is suggested that ras/erk/rsk is most likely to contribute to the maintenance of s6rp phosphorylation after blockade of both pi3k and mtorc <dig> signaling in these four canine cell lines 
 <cit> . because simultaneous inhibition of class i pi3k and mtor by the drug combination can result in down-regulation of pdk1- and mtor-mediated phosphorylation of pdk <dig>  it is possible that active erk signaling which is detected in these canine cell lines may support s6rp activity and thus provide an explanation for the limited effects of rapamycin in the down-regulation of s6rp phosphorylation in some lines such as  <dig>  in jurkat t cells, chronic exposure to rapamycin down-regulates both mtorc <dig> signaling and akt phosphorylation, which may provide an explanation for the high sensitivity of jurkat t cells to rapamycin. taken together, the additive/synergistic effects of zstk <dig> combined with rapamycin suggest the resistance of these canine cells to rapamycin alone, is due to active akt and erk survival pathways.

in summary, our data demonstrates that the class i pi3k/akt/mtor pathway is a major signaling axis in the survival of cancer cells. we show that zstk <dig> and kp372- <dig> effectively down-regulate cell viability, and highlight the critical role of akt activity in promoting the proliferation and survival of cells. further, we show that zstk <dig> and kp372- <dig> inhibit cell viability via different mechanisms. zstk <dig> effectively down-regulates mtorc <dig> signaling but has weak potency in apoptosis induction. kp372- <dig> has remarkable efficacy for apoptosis induction but has weak potency on mtorc <dig> inhibition. rapamycin at nanomolar concentrations has cytostatic effects. in contrast, rapamycin at micromolar doses shows cytotoxic effects, suggesting mtorc <dig> inhibition effectively inhibits the viability of canine cancer cells. we also show that zstk <dig> can enhance the effects of rapamycin on reducing cell viability, by inhibition of akt pathways. however, despite the additive or synergistic effects, the overlapping toxicities of these drugs would need to be resolved in a clinical setting. our data suggest that the effect of combining inhibition of the pi3k/akt pathway with conventional drugs such as doxorubicin is cell line dependent. however, dissecting this synergistic mechanism may offer an opportunity to identify cancer patients where this approach may be beneficial.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the results of the present study support the development of canine cancer therapy specifically targeting class i pi3k/akt pathway. this study also implicates mtorc <dig> as a potential target for canine cancer treatment. as such mtorc <dig> deserves further investigation to clarify the correlation of its downstream targets with tumour survival mechanism. in addition, the current data implicate the ras/raf/mek/erk pathway in resistance mechanisms to class i pi3k pathway inhibitors, supporting recent studies which generally recommend the use of combinatorial inhibitors targeting both pi3k/akt signaling and ras/erk signaling
