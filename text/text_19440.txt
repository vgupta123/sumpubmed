BACKGROUND
the production of biofuels from renewable cellulosic biomass is important for the development of alternative energy. the efficient hydrolysis of cellulose requires the synergistic action of endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolases and β-glucosidases . β-glucosidase is responsible for the hydrolysis of oligosaccharides and cellobiose into glucose. because oligosaccharides and cellobiose act as strong inhibitors of both endoglucanases and cellobiohydrolases, β-glucosidase is considered as a key enzyme for efficient cellulose hydrolysis  <cit> .

however, the efficient hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass is more difficult than that of pure cellulose, because the cellulosic fibers are usually entrapped in other structural biopolymers, mainly hemicelluloses and lignin. hemicelluloses consist of an available bulk source of xylose. in this context, glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases appear to be particularly well suited to maximize the overall efficiency of hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, acting in association with endo- and exocellulases and xylanases  <cit> . recently, many β-glucosidases with different glucose-tolerant or glucose-stimulated have been reported . however, only a few glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases have been characterized . the advantage of the β-glucosidase group in practical cellulosic biomass hydrolysis is not experimentally studied.


anoxybacillus flavithermus ssp. yunnanensis e13t is a thermophilic bacterium that grows at 60 °c  <cit> . we determined the whole genome sequence of the strain e13t  <cit>  and noted that a gene sequence , defined as β-glucosidase in function annotation based on genbank database, exhibited similarity with some putative β-glucosidases without being biochemically characterized. in this paper, the gene bglp was cloned, expressed and characterized in detail. the novel thermostable bglp is a glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidase. the supplementation of bglp significantly enhanced the glucose yield from sugarcane bagasse, especially in the presence of high concentrations of glucose or xylose.

RESULTS
sequence analysis of bglp
a β-glucosidase gene  of 1347 bp with a predicted molecular weight of 52 kda was revealed by the whole genome sequencing of a. flavithermus subsp. yunnanensis e13t. no signal peptide was found. the amino acid sequence of bglp showed the highest sequence similarity of 91% with a glucose-tolerant β-glucosidase from anoxybacillus sp. dt3- <dig>  <cit> , 60% with a β-glucosidase from bacillus bogoriensis , 56% with a β-glucosidase from caldicoprobacter oshimai  and 55–57% with some β-glucosidases from thermoanaerobacter sp. strains . the sequence alignment of bglp with the homologous is shown in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  two conserved catalytic nucleophile regions  which are highly conserved throughout the glycoside hydrolase family  <dig>  are identified in bglp.

enzymatic properties of the purified bglp
the recombinant bglp was expressed in soluble form in e. coli bl <dig>  cells and purified with ni-nta affinity chromatography. the purified bglp was a single band on 10% sds-page . the apparent molecular mass of bglp was approximately 52 kda, which corresponded to the calculated mass.

the recombinant bglp exhibited the maximum activity at 60 °c , and it exhibited 50% of its optimal activity at 70 °c. the temperature stability of bglp was assayed between  <dig> and 70 °c up to 15 h . bglp showed good stability at the optimum temperature 60 °c, as the half-life at 60 °c was approximately 10 h. bglp exhibited optimal activity at ph  <dig> , with more than 80% enzyme activity at ph from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the enzyme was found to be very stable in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  . bglp retained over 81% of initial activity after 20 h of incubation at ph  <dig>  and it was totally stable at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>  . the activity of bglp toward various substrates was measured to determine substrate specificity . the maximum activity was obtained with pnpg . the k

effect of sugars on the activity and thermostability of bglp
the effects of various sugars  on bglp activity were determined . surprisingly, all of the  <dig> tested sugars showed no significant inhibition of bglp. the bglp activity was significantly stimulated by glucose and xylose, respectively. therefore, the activity on different concentrations of the two sugars was further determined . a maximal  <dig> -fold stimulation by glucose was observed at  <dig>  m, and a maximal  <dig> -fold stimulation by xylose was found at  <dig>  m. bglp activated by glucose and xylose was unusually remained at concentrations up to  <dig>  and  <dig>  m, respectively. at fixed glucose concentrations of  <dig>  m, increasing concentrations of pnpg  stimulated the enzymatic activity. the k

to fully exploit the effect of glucose on bglp, the enzymatic thermostability at 60-70 °c was determined in the presence of a final concentration of 1 m glucose . the result suggested that the stability significantly increased in the presence of glucose. the bglp preserved 65% of its original activity after 15-h incubation at 60 °c in the presence of glucose. the half-life of bglp at 65 °c was approximately 2 h, while the half-life prolonged to approximately  <dig>  h in the presence of glucose.

conversion of sugarcane bagasse under high glucose and xylose concentrations
to evaluate the application potential of bglp in the cellulosic biomass hydrolysis where glucose and xylose concentrations are high, the conversion of sugarcane bagasse by celluclast®  <dig>  l with or without bglp was performed in the presence of various initial concentrations of glucose  and xylose  . the cellulose content was  <dig> %  in the sugarcane bagasse. after a 48-h hydrolysis at 60 °c, ph  <dig> , the concentration of glucose released by celluclast®  <dig>  l alone was measured to be  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg/ml, representing  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of the conversion. when the synergistic action of bglp and celluclast®  <dig>  l was performed, a  <dig> -fold conversion increase was observed, and the final conversion was up to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % .fig.  <dig> effects of glucose  and xylose  on the conversions of sugarcane bagasse. the reactions were performed at 60 °c in 50 mm na2hpo4-citric acid buffer . the concentration of the substrate was 10% . addition of bglp to celluclast®  <dig>  l significantly improved the conversions under all the conditions tested. celluclast®  <dig>  alone: black bars; bglp and celluclast®  <dig>  l: grey bars. values are the means ± sd of six experiments 




the conversion of sugarcane bagasse decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %  in the presence of 50 mm of glucose in the initial reaction mixture. the conversions further decreased with increasing initial concentrations of glucose. the lowest  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of conversion was observed at 500 mm initial glucose. the β-glucosidase in celluclast®  <dig>  l showed a lower hydrolytic efficiency in the presence of high concentrations of glucose. the supplementation of bglp significantly enhanced the conversion under all the concentrations of glucose. the conversion of the synergistic action at 500 mm was  <dig>  ±  <dig> % , which was  <dig> -fold higher than that of celluclast®  <dig>  l alone.

although the addition of 50 mm xylose had no effect on the conversion that performed by celluclast®  <dig>  l alone, a significant inhibition was observed when the xylose concentration was over 100 mm , which suggested the β-glucosidase in celluclast®  <dig>  l is only sensitive to high concentrations of xylose. the conversion by celluclast®  <dig>  l alone at 200 mm decreased to  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. when bglp was added to the reaction mixture, the conversion only weakly decreased from  <dig>  ±  <dig>  to  <dig>  ±  <dig> % with increasing initial concentrations of xylose from  <dig> to 200 mm. the conversion at 200 mm was  <dig> -fold higher than that of celluclast®  <dig>  l alone.

discussion
β-glucosidase is an important component of the cellulose enzyme system. a strong inhibition of β-glucosidase by glucose is most commonly observed  <cit> . searching for novel β-glucosidases with insensitive to glucose attracts more interest in recent years. based on the different influences of glucose on the activity, cao et al.  <cit>  concluded that β-glucosidases can be divided roughly into three groups:  the glucose-sensitive β-glucosidases;  the glucose-tolerant β-glucosidases that are not activated by glucose;  the glucose-stimulated β-glucosidases. the glucose-stimulated β-glucosidases are less common, as compared with two previous groups. the bglp activity is stimulated  <dig> -fold by  <dig>  m glucose , therefore bglp should belong to the last group.

the stimulatory specific activity of bglp was as high as 2163 ±  <dig>  u/mg at  <dig>  m glucose, and this level was higher than most of glucose-stimulated β-glucosidases. the β-glucosidases from uncultured bacterium  <cit> , thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense  <cit> , anoxybacillus sp. dt3- <dig>  <cit>  and neotermes koshunensis  <cit>  were stimulated about  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold by glucose, respectively and the stimulatory specific activity were about  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> u/mg, respectively. one of the reasons for the stimulation could be transglycosylation  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the reaction products of bglp after incubation with 10 mm pnpg and glucose . no other product except glucose was determined, suggesting a lack of transglycosylation activity in bglp. souza et al.  <cit>  speculated that the stimulatory effect of glucose may be attributed to its binding to modulator binding sites, probably inducing conformational changes that stimulate the hydrolyzing activity. further work will be necessary to determine whether the same applies to bglp.

besides glucose stimulation, bglp is also stimulated by xylose, which distinguishes the enzyme from the stimulatory group of β-glucosidases. xylan chains are entrapped inside cellulosic fibers. during cellulose hydrolysis, the final result of synergistic action of xylanases and cellulases is a high product of both glucose and xylose  <cit> . thus, the glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases are very attractive to improve the effectiveness of cellulose hydrolysis. however, to our knowledge, only six β-glucosidases were reported to be stimulated by both glucose and xylose . the practical hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass with the enzymes has not been done so far. compared with these β-glucosidases, bglp displayed higher stimulation/tolerance levels, stronger specific activity and better thermostability. therefore, its synergistic act with celluclast®  <dig>  l on converting sugarcane bagasse was investigated under the optimum conditions of bglp in the presence/absence of glucose or xylose .table  <dig> characteristics of bglp from a. flavithermus subsp. yunnanensis e13t and other glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases

in the case without initial sugar, the conversion of sugarcane bagasse by bglp was improved  <dig> -fold than of celluclast®  <dig>  l alone. the supplement of β-glucosidases from a metagenomic library  <cit>  and thermoanaerobacterium aotearoense  <cit>  to the conversion of sugarcane bagasse resulted in about  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold enhancement, respectively. the enhancement levels were lower than that of bglp, which may be due to the higher specific activity of bglp. in the case with initial sugar, since the β-glucosidases in celluclast®  <dig>  l is sensitive to both glucose and xylose, the advantages of bglp were more obvious. the conversion supplemented with bglp was  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold higher than that of celluclast®  <dig>  l alone at 500 mm of initial glucose and 200 mm of initial xylose, respectively. the results not only clearly revealed the significant role of the glucose- and xylose-stimulated β-glucosidases in the practical hydrolysis of cellulosic biomass, but also showed that bglp should have important practical implication in cellulose refining.

CONCLUSIONS
bglp from a. flavithermus subsp. yunnanensis e13t is a thermostable β-glucosidase, whose hydrolysis rate  is very fast. the activity of bglp is dramatically stimulated by glucose and xylose, and has high tolerance to glucose and xylose. the supplement of bglp to the hydrolysis mixture of sugarcane bagasse containing celluclast®  <dig>  l resulted in great enhancement of the conversion, especially in the presence of high concentrations of glucose and xylose.
