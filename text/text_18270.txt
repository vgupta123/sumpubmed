BACKGROUND
microbial biofilms have an innate resistance to antimicrobials and immune attack and have been recently linked to many recalcitrant or recurrent infections  <cit> . the ability of c. albicans to form biofilms on prosthetic devices and mucosal surfaces is believed to be intimately associated with its ability to trigger systemic or mucosal infection  <cit> . therefore the development of novel anti-biofilm agents is of paramount importance in the treatment or prevention of these infections.

susceptibility of candida biofilms to anti-fungal agents is frequently measured using colorimetric assays that estimate metabolic activity of viable cells residing in biofilms  <cit> . such assays have also been widely used to assess viable cell numbers  <cit> . in these assays metabolically active cells convert tetrazolium dyes into colored formazan derivatives that can be measured by a multi-well scanning spectrophotometer  <cit> . a key component of one of the formazan assays is sodium salt of  <dig> -bis-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxyanilide, or xtt. mitochondrial dehydrogenases of viable cells cleave the tetrazolium ring of xtt yielding water-soluble orange formazan. the bioreduction of xtt is inefficient and can be potentiated by addition of an electron-coupling agent such as phenazine methosulfate  <cit> , menadione  <cit>  or coenzyme q <dig>   <cit> .

the xtt assay has been used under various conditions for viability assessment of different organisms including mammalian cells, bacteria and fungi  <cit> . its wide-spread use is due to the fact that it is simple, fast, and does not require highly specialized equipment other than a spectrophotometer. however, it is accurate only if there is a linear relationship between cell metabolic activity  and colorimetric signal. thus, for the assay to be quantitative, it is important to optimize several key experimental parameters  for every organism and every experimental condition  <cit> . assay optimization can be more challenging in mature biofilms since metabolic activity and viable cell number may not be linearly related  <cit> . in addition, colony counting methods of viability assessment are not appropriate for mature biofilms since they consist of multicellular hyphal organisms encased in a polysaccharide matrix, which hinders single cell colony growth. given these facts we sought to critically examine the limitations of the xtt assay in measuring metabolic changes in mature biofilms and develop a molecular assay based on pcr for biofilm viability estimates that would overcome these limitations.

RESULTS
we first tried to optimize the xtt assay for a wide range of candida cell densities, which would represent different stages of biofilm growth. as shown in figure 1a-b overall, a linear relationship between the od <dig> signal and yeast cell number was observed only when yeast did not exceed  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well. above this cell density, significant changes in yeast cell number  resulted in very small or undetectable differences in od <dig> values. this suggests that the xtt assay would be of limited value in mature biofilms, since c. albicans biofilms are frequently started by seeding ≥ <dig> ×  <dig> yeast cells per well, in  <dig> well plates, and grown for 48h or longer for biofilms to mature  <cit> .

increasing the concentration of xtt up to  <dig> mg/ml  did not result in a change in od <dig> when the seeding yeast cell number was equal to or lower than  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well . with yeast cell numbers higher than  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well, increasing the concentration of xtt resulted in higher od <dig> values, which extended the linearity range only up to  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well. this suggests that xtt solubility and final concentration are limiting factors in this reaction, especially when large numbers of yeast cells are used to start biofilms.

we also investigated if varying the concentration of the electron-coupling agent coq  would allow us to extend the linearity range of the xtt signal. xtt conversion rates were slower at lower concentrations of coq, generating flat slopes . however, we found that increasing the concentration of coq would not increase the linearity range . reading the plates at  <dig> nm as opposed to  <dig> nm or increasing the xtt reaction time to  <dig> hours still did not improve the linearity range , since reaction time in higher cell densities  was typically very fast . collectively, these data suggest that the xtt assay cannot be adequately optimized to accommodate the cell numbers present in mature biofilms.

to further address this issue we developed a molecular assay for biofilm assessment based on quantitation of efb <dig> gene transcripts in candida cells, since the ef-1β protein is critical in regulating cell protein translation rates and growth  <cit> . the efb <dig> primer pairs specifically amplified pcr products of the predicted size  from c. albicans cdna and gave no pcr product when tested with hl- <dig> cell cdna . to generate standard curves amplification of serially diluted plasmid pefb was monitored by fluorescence versus cycle number curves. the assay could detect  <dig> fg of pefb, which is equivalent to  <dig>  copies of pefb.

comparison of the two assays in quantifying viable cells at a wide range of seeding cell densities showed that in contrast to the xtt assay, which gave a flat colorimetric signal for cell densities exceeding  <dig> × 105/ <dig> mm <dig> of surface area, the new assay was able to quantify cells at densities up to  <dig> × 107/ <dig> mm <dig> . in fact, two fold differences in viable cells were accurately quantified at seeding densities ranging between  <dig> × 104- <dig> × 107/ <dig> mm <dig> with the qrt-pcr assay .

to further assess the accuracy of the qrt-pcr assay we compared it to viable colony counts, as well as to the xtt assay, in detecting viability changes in planktonic cells triggered by fluconazole or caspofungin. as shown in figure  <dig>  the qrt-pcr assay could accurately quantify a dose-dependent antifungal drug toxicity in planktonic cells and was in good agreement with the xtt and cfu assays . our data also show that the xtt and qrt-pcr assays were in good agreement in quantifying toxicity in early biofilms triggered by amphotericin b, whereas organisms killed by heat produced no signal in the xtt or qrt-pcr assay . the latter was confirmed by the absence of cfu's in sabouraud agar plates.

in order to compare the ability of the xtt and qrt-pcr assays to accurately quantify changes in viable mature biofilms, the biomass of biofilms grown for  <dig> hours was mechanically reduced and remaining biofilm cells were assessed with the two assays. the xtt assay showed that removal of 25-50% of the biofilm mass resulted in a detectable decrease in od <dig> values, compared to intact biofilm. however, there were no significant differences in the xtt signals resulting from removal of different biofilm amounts, thus the xtt signal reduction was not commensurate to the reductions in biomass. this shows that the xtt assay cannot accurately quantify changes in mature biofilms . in contrast, the qrt-pcr assay showed excellent agreement with reduction in the biofilm mass since 25%, 33% and 50% biofilm removal resulted in an average of  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % reduction in the logarithmic efb <dig> transcript copy numbers, respectively . this confirms the ability of the real-time rt-pcr assay to accurately measure reduction in biofilm metabolic activity in mature biofilms.

neutrophils exhibit potent candidacidal activities in vitro  <cit>  and interact with candida biofilms forming on mucosal tissues in vivo  <cit> . however there is a paucity of information regarding the outcome of the interactions of neutrophils with biofilm organisms  <cit> . one of the difficulties in studying these interactions in vitro is the shortage of quantitative assays to accurately assess neutrophil-inflicted damage in mature biofilms. therefore, we compared the ability of the two assays to detect and quantify damage inflicted to early and mature biofilms by hl- <dig> cells, a human neutrophil-like cell line.

when hl- <dig> cells interacted with early  biofilms, significant biofilm damage  could be detected at 10: <dig> effector to target ratio, regardless of the assay used to measure viable biofilm changes . significant dose response differences to the number of effectors could also be detected with both assays in early biofilms. thus there was close agreement between the two assays when early biofilms were tested. however, in mature biofilms the xtt assay revealed overall less than 25% fungal damage by immune effectors and produced similar signals regardless of the number of effectors present, although there was a slight indication of a dose response . in contrast, the real-time rt-pcr assay revealed a more robust dose response of mature biofilms to immune effectors, with damage to mature biofilms ranging approximately between 10-45%, depending on the effector to target ratio . nevertheless, regardless of the assay, early biofilms exhibited significantly higher susceptibility to neutrophil-like cells than mature biofilms, consistent with a recent report  <cit> .

we next compared the performance of the xtt and qrt-pcr assays in quantifying viability changes in mature biofilms grown on a three dimensional model of the human oral mucosa. in order to do this we measured the effects of three antifungal drugs with different mechanisms of action, as well as damage inflicted by human leukocytes to mucosal biofilms. as expected, the data showed that the xtt assay underestimates damage to mature biofilms in this system, when smaller levels of biofilm toxicity are measured, such as the ones obtained with fluconazole, caspofungin or leukocytes . in contrast, the qrt-pcr assay revealed significant candida toxicity by all antifungal agents tested, which was consistent with the limited levels of candida tissue invasion into the submucosal compartment in the presence of these agents .

discussion
real-time pcr technologies combine the sensitivity of conventional pcr with the generation of a quantifiable fluorescent signal and have been increasingly used to assess viability of microorganisms  <cit> . quantitative real-time pcr allows for the detection of pcr products produced at each step of the reaction, since an increase in reporter fluorescent signal is directly proportional to the number of amplicons generated. as we have done in this work, pcr products can be quantitated by generating a standard curve, in which the absolute concentration of the plasmid standard is known.

in this study we measured the effect of anti-fungal agents against mature biofilms with a real-time rt-pcr assay based on the quantification of efb <dig> transcript copy numbers in biofilm cells. the efb <dig> gene is constitutively expressed under most growth conditions and is frequently used as a normalization gene in real-time rt-pcr quantification of other candida genes  <cit> . by designing sense primers that span an intron splice site in the efb <dig> sequence, we expected that only intact mrna molecules would serve as a template in the rt-pcr assay and that these molecules would be degraded following the death of the organisms in the biofilm. our results with this molecular assay are consistent with our expectations and show that it is highly quantitative in a wider range of seeding fungal cell densities and that it more accurately measures small-moderate mature biofilm changes in response to stressors, compared to the traditional xtt assay. we have also shown that this assay is particularly well suited for fungal biofilm viability estimates in complex biological systems containing immune effectors or mucosal cell cultures. this may be partly due to the fact that mammalian cells also metabolize xtt, which further limits substrate availability  <cit> .

compared to the xtt assay, the real-time assay is more technically demanding, more prone to experimental errors due to the multiple additional steps required in sample preparation, more costly, and significantly more time consuming. thus it should be reserved for susceptibility testing of mature biofilms growing in complex biological model systems containing immune effectors or mucosal cells or used as a confirmatory assay when small changes in mature biofilms are detected with the xtt assay.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, our results indicate that the xtt assay has to be applied with caution to biological systems containing large numbers of organisms alone or in combination with mammalian cells. we also conclude that molecular assessment of biofilms based on quantitation of efb <dig> transcripts is a sensitive, reproducible and quantitative method to measure the damaging effect of anti-fungal agents against mature biofilms. the new quantitative assay will aid in further investigations of the mechanisms of candida biofilm resistance to immune effector cells, which are presently unknown. in addition the new assay can be applied in quantitative assessment of mature biofilm susceptibility to novel anti-biofilm therapeutic agents that are applied topically on mucosal surfaces.
