BACKGROUND
retrotransposon sequences comprise more than  <dig> % of the human genome  <cit> . once dismissed as "junk dna" of little or no adaptive significance  <cit> , retrotransposons and other classes of transposable elements  are now generally considered as significant contributors to gene and genome evolution  <cit> . of particular interest has been the ability of tes to contribute to exon evolution by "exonization", i.e., an insertion of a te into an intron and subsequent recruitment of this sequence or its part into a new protein-coding exon  <cit> . for example, it has been estimated that 5% of all alternatively spliced human exons had been derived from the exonization of alu elements  <cit> .

ltr transposable elements comprise nearly one-tenth of the human genome and have been implicated in the cis-regulatory evolution of a number of human genes  <cit> . the structure of a complete ltr retrotransposon  comprises two copies of long terminal directed repeats  flanking an internal region containing gag and pol genes, which encode a protease, reverse transcriptase, rnase h and integrase. these protein products are necessary for the formation of virus-like particles  wherein replication of the element takes place. some elements evolved from retroviruses have additional open reading frames , e.g. env gene  <cit> . flanking ltrs contain all the necessary transcriptional regulatory elements.

although global database screens have been conducted to examine the contribution of tes to human protein-coding regions  <cit> , none have concentrated specifically on the prevalence of the lrts-derived protein-coding exons of human genes. here we report the results of computational analysis of the lrts exonization in human genome. also we describe the plausible scenario of the exonization process of an alternatively spliced exon of the alpha  <dig> gene of the interleukin  <dig> receptor  supported by new experimental data.

RESULTS
updated list of lrts-associated genes
to identify incidences of lrts exonization, the annotation of human exons given in the ucsc genome browser was compared with the annotation of transposable elements available in the same source. we detected lrts associations in  <dig>  out of  <dig>  genes . these associations include  <dig>  distinct exons participating in  <dig>  transcripts . it was reported earlier  <cit>  that  <dig> out of  <dig>  human genes  were found to contain lrts in protein coding regions. in comparison, in our data set  we observed lrts associations with protein-coding exons in  <dig> genes . current lrts search done at the dna instead of mrna level helped detect several short lrts-exon overlaps that could be missed at mrna level. interestingly, only  <dig> of the previously reported  <dig> cases were found in current analysis using the updated refseq gene data. many previously identified cases  did not show up in our data set as the earlier sequences were removed, suppressed, or replaced. several cases appear to be possible false positives. in one case, lrts was detected in utr instead of in cds. no lrts was detected in other two cases when the repeatmasker program was run separately on each mrna sequence using its specific g+c content, which gives a slightly more accurate result, as opposed to input of multiple sequences with averaged g+c content used in the program  <cit> .

distribution of lrts in human exons
we found that human gene exons  overlap with ltr flanks of ltr elements more frequently  than with internal sequences . this observation could be related to the fact that most  of the ltr retroposon-derived sequences in human genome consist only of a solo ltr, with the internal sequence lost due to homologous recombination between the flanking ltrs  <cit> . upon checking by blastx of  <dig> exons overlapping with the internal sequences,  <dig> exons were found to contain a section or even a whole viral gene . however, only  <dig> of these  <dig> exons were protein-coding exons. moreover, only in  <dig> cases was the reading frame of a human gene the same as the one of the viral gene. seven out of these ten cases were observed in hypothetical genes. the remaining three cases represented a gene for endogenous retroviral protein, syncytin , a gene for krueppel-related zinc finger protein and a placenta-specific gene  which protein products contain the envelope, envelope and gag viral protein domain, respectively. all three genes are preferentially expressed in the placenta  <cit> . this observation indicates that the invasion of the human endogenous retrovirus  may contribute to molecular mechanisms involved in human reproduction  <cit> .

the majority of exons overlapping with lrts  contain sequences homologous to only one lrts. exons overlapping with more than one lrts were observed as well . overall, we have found  <dig>  associations  between an lrts and an exonic sequence. these  <dig>  observations were classified further according to the extent of lrts overlap with an exon , type of exon , and lrts class/family . the majority of lrts associations with genes  constitute an apparent extension of original exon due to activation of alternative splice site located inside lrts. on the other hand, in  <dig> %  of these associations lrts was recruited as an entirely novel exon .

regarding the distribution of lrts within a complete gene structure , the lrts fragments were found in untranslated regions , mainly in 3'utrs, much more frequently than in protein-coding  regions. this observation is consistent with the previous study  <cit>  and indicates the putative role of lrts in resident gene regulation by providing sequence material for emerging regulatory sequences  <cit> . in comparison, insertion of lrts in a protein coding region may interfere with gene function, and in many cases such a modification is likely to be eliminated by negative selection. note that an lrts was found more frequently in the last cds exon, especially in the exon untranslated region, and less frequently in internal coding exons .

lrts-derived protein coding exons
we have found  <dig> protein coding exons completely derived from lrts . most of lrts-derived exons  were comprised exclusively of ltr flanking regions. eleven exons were derived from ltr element internal sequences and  <dig> exons contained both types of regions. of the  <dig> exons,  <dig> were components of well characterized protein coding genes .

the low frequency of protein coding exons fully derived from lrts indicates that the chance of a successful recruitment of a whole coding exon from the ltr transposable element is rather small. the exonization of originally intronic lrts requires the presence of a pair of potential splice sites, enclosing a sequence with no stop codon in the appropriate reading frame. also, the amino acids contributed by a mobile element should not disrupt the structure of a protein encoded by the original gene, particularly, the addition of a new exon should not change the coding frame for the remaining part of a gene.

interestingly, most of the protein coding exons derived entirely from the ltr flanking regions originated from the malr family . this could be explained by several factors. first of all, malr elements make up about 50% of the ltr retroelements in the human genome  <cit> , and this high frequency alone may relate to their overrepresentation in protein coding exons. malrs are also relatively ancient elements, which have probably been exposed to more opportunities for exonizations over time. note that the age factor has been implicated for proliferation of alu-derived exons as well  <cit> . finally, it is a formal possibility that nucleotide sequences of the malr family are better amenable for derivation of protein coding exons.

the internal sequence of malr is rarely found retained in the human genomic sequence  <cit> . particularly, among exons derived from the internal parts of lrts only one was from the malr family.

contribution of lrts to gene transcripts
we further analyzed the abundance of lrts-derived exons in gene transcripts. most of the  <dig> genes containing at least one exon completely derived from lrts  are single transcript genes while the remaining  <dig> generate more than one transcript per gene. note that about 60%  of single transcript genes encode zinc finger proteins  or hypothetical proteins . apparently for the single transcript gene the lrts insertion either has not disrupted the host gene function or possibly provided some beneficial modulation of the initial function and thus has been tolerated by natural selection.

in  <dig> out of  <dig> genes  with multiple transcripts, lrts-derived exons were present in some transcript variants, but not in all of them. this observation corresponds to the scenario whereby recruiting of lrts into alternatively spliced exon allows the main transcript to maintain the function while the lrts-associated exons are "examined" by natural selection, which may lead to emergence of transcripts with new functions.

we also found that most of the lrts-derived protein coding exons  were either alternatively spliced ones or the components of single transcript genes. in contrast, most of lrts derived constitutive exons  are found in 5'utr sequences. this observation indicates that novel cis-regulatory sequences supplied by ltr elements to human genes are more likely to be fixed in evolution than sequences supplying protein coding domain which are used as alternative ways to create protein variability.

reconstruction of evolution of il22ra <dig> gene 
the il22ra <dig> gene has an internal protein coding exon derived from an ltr flanking sequence. this gene encodes the only soluble receptor  <cit>  in the class ii cytokine receptor family . il22ra <dig> protein specifically binds to interleukin  <dig>  and by preventing the interaction of il <dig> with its cell surface receptor, neutralizes il <dig> activity  <cit> . three alternatively spliced transcripts of the il22ra <dig> human gene encoding three protein variants  have been described earlier  <cit> . the longest transcript  is generated  by addition of the  <dig> nt exon  to splice variant  <dig> between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig>  <cit> .

in the current study, we provide experimental data and computational analysis that show evolutionary evidence of exonization of lrts invaded the human il22ra <dig> gene. the exon 3/ <dig> of the il22ra <dig> gene  is situated within the ltr sequence of mstb <dig> subfamily of malr family ). the sequence alignment of the particular ltr and the mstb <dig> ltr consensus sequence shows  <dig>  % identity . the exon 3/ <dig> contributes  <dig> amino acids to the il22ra <dig> protein product without changing reading frame for the rest of the protein. a homologous exon was not found either in the mouse or in the rat orthologous gene. weiss et al.  <dig>  <cit>  also indicated that a counterpart of this exon was absent in mouse and rat. the functionality of the ltr exonization is corroborated by the existence of the mrna sequences containing the exon 3/ <dig> . the data available at the ucsc genome browser show that the mstb <dig> derived sequence is conserved in chimpanzee and rhesus monkey while is absent in other vertebrates. to extract the sequences homologous to the exon 3/ <dig> in seven primates: human, chimpanzee, bonobo, gorilla, orangutan, crab-eating macaque and rhesus monkey, we have performed the pcrs with human dna derived primers , which generated well interpretable pcr products for all species . we used newly determined pcr product sequences as well as publicly available genomic sequences of human, chimpanzee and rhesus monkey to construct the multiple sequence alignment. we observed that the splice sites flanking the target exon in all species but the crab-eating macaque and the rhesus monkey followed the gt/ag rule. in the other two species, we observed at instead of gt at the donor site . therefore, emergence of this exon was likely to occur in ape lineage earlier than the divergence of orangutans and humans . this event was mediated by the single transition from a to g yielding canonical donor splice site consensus. note that at  is positioned in the predicted ltr polyadenylation site aataaa . contrary to the acceptor site, the strength of the donor site depends on the presence of just a few specific nucleotides around gt consensus. therefore, a single mutation might create a functional donor splice site. the canonical dinucleotide  of the acceptor site appeared in all primates we have studied. however, this dinucleotide is different from dinucleotide  situated in the same position in mstb <dig> consensus sequence . one possibility is that the mutation of gc to ag could happen earlier in the primate lineage. however, the sequence logo generated from the multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> mstb <dig> sequences existing in the human genome shows low degree of conservation in the vicinity of acceptor site. therefore, the dinucleotide predecessor of ag should not necessarily be the consensus gc dinucleotide.

several coincidences must have been involved in creation of the exon 3/ <dig>  the viable structural elements of the splice sites  were created by mutations. with the upstream intron in phase  <dig>  the exon 3/ <dig> emerged in the frame which had no stop codons inside, while the other two possible phases of intron would cause premature termination of translation. the new exon 3/ <dig>  did not disrupt the global reading frame and therefore did not change the downstream amino acid sequence known to be important for ligand binding  <cit> . our findings show that the exon 3/ <dig> of il22ra <dig> might be active and be expressed in the great apes, while we have not confirmed its expression in the old world monkeys. this observation indicates that the exon 3/ <dig> is likely to possess functional properties and it is an alternatively spliced exon. we have evaluated the possibility that the exon 3/ <dig> is the subject for positive selection by the standard test based on non-synonymous ka to synonymous ks divergence rates ratio. there are three nonsynonymous substitutions between human and orangutan homologous exonic sequences, while there are no synonymous substitutions. the use of the laplace pseudocounts produces / >  <dig>  which indicates possible positive selection.

to date, very little is known about the role and the origin of this additional exon  in transcript variant  <dig>  being the only crf <dig> protein with  <dig> amino acids inserted adjacent to the region important for ligand recognition, this isoform may bind to structurally different ligands than other isoforms  <cit> . this possibility is supported by the experimental data which show that this variant fails to block il <dig> activity  <cit> . the longer malr-related isoform may also modulate tissue-specific expression. the available data show that the il22ra <dig> isoform  <dig> is expressed only in placenta while isoform  <dig> is highly expressed in placenta and mammary gland and at a lower level in spleen, skin, thymus and stomach  <cit> . however, nothing is known about the factors that control the expression of this longest il22ra <dig> variant. additional experiments should be performed to determine its function as well as to identify the possible change in ligand specificity due to the ltr-derived protein modification.

CONCLUSIONS
the distribution of ltr elements that became parts of human protein-coding genes shows the distinct preference of lrts fixation in 5' and 3'untranslated regions. these observations confirm existing concept of lrts role as a contributor to gene regulation evolution. on the other hand, the recruitment of lrts to encode a part of a protein domain leading the exaptation to evolution of the host gene is a less frequent event. as shown in the part of this paper related to evolution of il22ra <dig> gene, several coincidences are necessary to allow the lrts exonization event. the evolutionary analysis elucidates the action of the mechanism of incorporation of lrts into a novel alternatively spliced exon.
