BACKGROUND
papaya  is a major tropical fruit crop, and the only species in the genus carica. papaya shared a common ancestor with arabidopsis approximately  <dig> million years ago. its short juvenile phase of  <dig> to 4 months, continuous flowering, short generation time of 9 months, and small genome size of 372 mb  <cit>  make papaya a promising model for tropical fruit tree genomics  <cit> . though the papaya genome size is three times that of arabidopsis, the annotation of papaya’s whole genome sequence revealed that it contains fewer genes than arabidopsis <cit> , suggesting that the papaya genome might contain significantly more repetitive sequences than the arabidopsis genome.

the caricaceae family consists of  <dig> species; one monoecious,  <dig> dioecious, and two trioecious species, providing an invaluable system for studying plant sex determination. vasconcellea monoica is a monoecious species with no sex chromosomes, whereas all dioecious and trioecious species are likely to have sex chromosomes. papaya is a trioecious species with three sex phenotypes; female, male, and hermaphrodite. the sex determination of papaya is controlled by a pair of primitive sex chromosomes. female papaya has homogametic xx chromosomes, whereas male and hermaphrodite plants have heterogametic xy chromosomes. the male and the hermaphrodite have slightly different y chromosomes, y for males and yh for hermaphrodites  <cit> .

the papaya hermaphrodite-specific yh chromosome  region occupies approximately 13% of the yh chromosome  <cit> , and the chromosomal genetic recombination around this region is suppressed  <cit> , a typical feature of sex chromosomes  <cit> . the suppression of recombination creates conditions that are favorable for the accumulation of deleterious mutations in the non-recombining region of yh chromosome, and consequently the hsy has evolved in both physical size and gene content to differentiate from the corresponding x  <cit> . the highly diverged human x and y chromosomes only share about a dozen pairs of genes in the male specific region of the y chromosome . the human y chromosome is occupied by nearly 95% msy, and only 5% terminal area, called pseudoautosomal regions, accounting for crossing over with the x chromosome  <cit> . the human y chromosome contains a high percentage of repetitive elements and duplicated regions but low gene content  <cit> . compared to the human msy, the papaya hsy is at the early stage of its evolution and occupies only 13% of the yh chromosome  <cit> , but analysis of hsy bacterial artificial chromosomes  revealed that the papaya hsy contained significantly higher repeat content  <cit> . in addition, the sequence analysis of these bacs exhibited a higher content of ty3-gypsy and some ty1-copia retroelements, which are normally abundant near the centromeric region.

although it is well known that the recombination suppression of homologous sex chromosomes causes the accumulation of repetitive sequences, little is known about the feature of sex-specific repeats in plants. sex-specific markers are important for determining the presence of sex chromosomes  <cit> . in date palm , the presence of sex chromosomes was verified by the identification of sex-specific dna markers  <cit> . in hop , inter simple sequence repeat  markers were identified as sex-specific markers  <cit> . to date, dozens of sex-specific markers have been identified in various plant species and they are mostly used to support the presence of sex chromosomes  <cit> . if the y chromosome is degenerated progressively, then sex-specific repeats could be a very useful marker to examine the lineage of y chromosomes among plant species and perhaps they are useful to understand duplication events occurred in a given y chromosome. recently, four y-specific satellite dna families, raysi, rae <dig>  raysi-s, and raysi-j, were identified from rumex acetosa and used successfully as the references to examine the degeneration of the y chromosome among the genus rumex <cit> . therefore, identification of sex-specific repeats and analysis of their sequence features in papaya can provide valuable genomic resources for unraveling genetic lineages of sex chromosomes among dioecious and trioecious species in the caricaceae family and for revealing the roles that sex-specific repeats play in the sex chromosome evolution. as for agricultural aspects of papaya or other fruit crops with different sex types, sex-specific repeats can be used to develop molecular markers that distinguish plant sex types at the seedling stage.

the insertions of transposable elements are believed to be one of the earliest triggers that cause the suppression of recombination  <cit> . since papaya sex chromosomes are believed to be at an early stage of evolution, the information from papaya repetitive sequence analysis could be used to test whether such insertions of transposable elements are indeed a cause for the recombination suppression by out-crossing with monoecious v. monoica. here, we report not only the detailed repetitive sequence features of the newly sequenced papaya hsy and the corresponding x, but also the comparison of repetitive sequence features between the papaya sex determining region and the orthologous autosomal region in v. monoica, which has no sex chromosomes  <cit> , to provide insights into papaya sex chromosome evolution and their sequence features. as expected, the hsy is highly abundant with interspersed repeats compared to the corresponding x chromosome and the papaya genome. a new search of interspersed repeats in the given sequences enabled the identification of  <dig> new repeats with  <dig> of them being sex-specific repeats, which probably could be used as a reference for analysis of y chromosomes among the other species in the caricaceae family.

RESULTS
composition of interspersed repeats in the sex determining region of papaya
to examine repetitive sequences in both the hsy and the corresponding x, the sequences were masked by repeatmasker using a customized repeat database as a library consisting of repbase, tigr repeat data, and papaya repeats  <cit> . results showed that the interspersed repeats occupied approximately 77% of the hsy , 64% of the corresponding x , and only  <dig> % of v. monoica . among all interspersed repeats identified, the retroelements were the most abundant repeats, 64%, 54%, and 16% in the hsy, the corresponding x, and v. monoica, respectively. these retroelements accounted for the vast majority of all identifiable interspersed repeats and only a small fraction  of the interspersed repeats were dna transposons in the hsy, the corresponding x, and v. monoica . therefore, it is likely that the majority of unclassified interspersed repeats  could be classified into retroelements if they could be annotated .table  <dig>

long terminal repeats  accounted for more than 97% of all identifiable retroelements in all three sources of sequences and the ty3-gypsy element was the most abundant ltr in the hsy and the corresponding x, whereas ty1-copia element was more abundant in v. monoica . the number and sequences of ty3-gypsy elements increased notably along the increase of sequence length in the hsy and the corresponding x . to examine the portion of papaya-specific repeats accounting for interspersed repeats, the hsy and the corresponding x sequences were also masked by only known repeats, consisting of repbase and tigr repeats excluding papaya repeats. the known repeat content was approximately  <dig> % in the hsy; 2% higher than  <dig> % in the corresponding x . as a result, papaya-specific repeats were at least  <dig> % and  <dig> % in the hsy and in the corresponding x, respectively.figure  <dig>

although the hsy and the corresponding x were highly occupied by interspersed repeats, there were potential gene rich regions with significantly low repeat accumulation. two large sequence blocks with scarce or no repeats were detected from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb and from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb in the corresponding x  <cit> , whereas only one large block with low repeat content was found from  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb region in the hsy  <cit> .

identification of sex-specific repeats in the papaya sex determining region
from the extensive search for sex-specific repeats in the sex determining region,  <dig> putative sex-specific repeats were identified,  <dig> from the hsy and three from the corresponding x . in order to determine sex-specific repeats among the  <dig> newly identified repeats, all repeats were aligned against papaya genome sequences. among them,  <dig> repeats were selected as potential sex-specific repeats because they had no match or very low occurrence in the papaya genome . although the rest of the repeats were present in both the sex determining region and the papaya genome, they were more frequent in the sex determining region . the  <dig> new repeats occupied approximately  <dig> % of the hsy,  <dig> % of the corresponding x, and  <dig> % of the papaya genome . by contrast, the  <dig> sex-specific repeats accounted for  <dig> % of the hsy sequences,  <dig> % of the corresponding x, and  <dig> % of the papaya genome . to test whether papaya and v. monoica share any common repeat sequences, we analyzed the accumulation of the sex-specific repeats in v. monoica shotgun sequences and the 11 v. monoica bac sequences corresponding to the sex determining region of the x chromosome. both v. monoica genome and the bac sequence showed much less sex-specific repeat accumulation .table  <dig>

to examine the localization of the sex-specific repeats in the sex determining region, all positions aligned with the sex-specific repeats were plotted to their corresponding locations in the hsy  or in the corresponding x . most hsy-specific repeats were located in two regions in the hsy, from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  mb , but rarely found in the corresponding x except for x-r <dig> , an x-specific repeat. remarkably, the two regions in the hsy with high hsy-specific repeats were matched to two hsy expansion regions very well  <cit> .figure  <dig>

among the  <dig> potential sex-specific repeats, two hsy-specific repeats, hsy-r <dig> and hsy-r <dig>  and one x-specific repeat, x-r <dig>  were selected for further analyses. hermaphrodite specificity of both hsy-specific repeats was confirmed by pcr using genomic dna samples as templates. both repeats were confirmed to be present only in sunup hermaphrodite plants having both the hermaphrodite yh and x chromosomes, but not in sunup females having two x chromosomes . since all hsy-specific repeats were present in more than  <dig> copies , it was of interest to examine the phylogenetic relationship among copies of each hsy repeat. twenty-two aligned sequences to hsy-r <dig> and thirteen aligned sequences to hsy-r <dig> were retrieved from the hsy sequences for phylogenetic analysis. phylogenetic analysis revealed that there was no correlation between distance and sequence identity among copies , which was further confirmed by the mantel test . the correlation coefficient of the mantel test  and the one-tailed p-value  were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the hsy-r <dig> and - <dig>  and  <dig>  for the hsy-r <dig>  respectively.figure  <dig>

the potential x-specific repeat, x-r <dig>  appeared  <dig> times  only in the corresponding x, but not in the hsy and papaya genome sequences . the copies of the x-r <dig> repeat were present within a small range with ~50 kb  in the corresponding x, and the repeat size ranged from  <dig> to 306 bp. except for the two copies at both ends, the rest of the  <dig> copies were oriented in the same direction and tandemly repeated in three separate repeat blocks, apart from each other by about  <dig> to 15 kb . the first repeat block near a zinc finger protein consisted of  <dig> tandem repeats, the second block of  <dig>  and the third block of  <dig> . among the  <dig> copies of x-r <dig> repeat, the  <dig> copies longer than 200 bp were used for phylogenetic analysis. similar to the result of phylogenetic analysis of two hsy-specific repeats, the distance among individual copies did not show correlation to the sequence similarity . an interesting feature of the x-r <dig> repeat was that it showed very high sequence identity  with the third exon of a potential carica papaya  zinc finger protein nearby , whose expression was confirmed by an expressed sequence tag . if the x-r <dig> repeats originated from the third exon of the cp zinc finger protein, the second repeat block could be the most recently duplicated, on the basis of phylogenetic analysis . the presence of the x-r <dig> repeat was confirmed by pcr . the expression of the cp zinc finger protein was examined by rt-pcr and detected in all sex types of flowers and leaf tissues from ‘sunup’ and ‘au9’ papayas, and also in seed and half ripened fruit of ‘sunup’ . phylogenetic analysis revealed that the cp zinc finger protein was closely related to arabidopsis zinc finger gene  .figure  <dig>

accumulation of ssrs in the sex determining region
accumulation of repetitive sequences is one of the key elements for the degeneration of sex chromosomes. accordingly, high repetitive sequence accumulation was observed in papaya hsy and in the corresponding x compared to that of papaya genome  <cit> . however, not only interspersed repeats but also tandem dna repeats were accumulated in sex chromosomes  <cit> . simple sequence repeats  of the short tandem dna repeats normally originate from slippage during dna replication. therefore, ssrs were examined in the hsy and the corresponding x . the ssr densities were much lower in the hsy  than in the corresponding x  and the papaya genome . on the other hand, ssr densities of v. monoica bac sequences were even higher  than papaya genome . ssrs have been categorized into two classes, class i and class ii. class i includes hypervariable ssrs ≥ 20 bp, whereas class ii consists of less variable ssrs ≥ 12 bp and < 20 bp  <cit> . class i and class ii ssr densities were lower either in the hsy or in the corresponding x compared to those in the papaya genome . class i and class ii ssr densities in v. monoica bac sequence were comparable to those in v. monoica shotgun genome . class i ssr densities in the corresponding x, v. monoica bacs and shotgun sequence, and papaya genome were approximately two-fold less than that of class ii ssr, but much less in the hsy compared to the rest. ssr density of di-nucleotide ssr units were similar between papaya genome and v. monoica shotgun or bac sequences, but ssr density of tri-nucleotide ssr units in v. monoica genome was significantly higher than that of the papaya genome . therefore, it was evident that ssr frequency in the sex determining region was lower than that in papaya genome and v. monoica genome.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, we characterized the detailed genomic structure of the papaya sex determining region by analyzing the interspersed and short tandem repeat distribution and identifying potential sex-specific repeats. analysis of sex-specific repeats revealed that the accumulation and distribution of these repeats have a very close relationship with the expansion of the sex determining region, implying that sex-specific repeats may play crucial roles in the differentiation of sex chromosomes. in addition, the corresponding x was compared to orthologous autosomal sequences of v. monoica, revealing that the expansion of the papaya sex determining region is associated with increased frequency of ty3-gypsy retroelements.

distribution of repetitive sequences
y chromosomes are featured by degeneration, duplication, and abundance of repetitive sequences due to a non-recombining property. the hsy sequences on the papaya yh chromosome were occupied by higher repetitive sequences, compared to its x counterpart  <cit> . the average repeat content of the hsy was approximately 77%, 13% higher than the 64% of the corresponding x . these numbers were different from what we reported previously  <cit> , which was caused by the analysis of all  <dig>  mb x sequences including  <dig>  mb knob  <dig> sequences that were not included in the previous report. the high accumulation of repetitive dna sequences was shown in ancient y chromosomes in human  <cit>  and drosophila melanogaster <cit> , also in the nascent y chromosome in drosophila miranda <cit>  and silene latifolia <cit> . repeat contents of the hsy and the corresponding x increased dramatically when masked by a repeat library containing both papaya and public repeat sequences, compared to the repeat contents of  <dig> % of the hsy and  <dig> % of the corresponding x when both sequences were masked by only publicly available known repeat sequences , indicating that the majority of repeats accumulated in the sex determining regions are most likely papaya-specific  <cit> . it is worth noting that the conserved repetitive sequences in the hsy and its x counterpart were more than the genome-wide average of 14%  <cit>  and also higher than the repeat content in v. monoica, which has no sex chromosomes, reinforcing the notion that increased repetitive sequences are a feature of the sex determining region.

ty3-gypsy elements were highly accumulated in the sex determining region and accounted for  <dig> % of the hsy and  <dig> % of the corresponding x . the ty3-gypsy content of the hsy was ~8% lower than that the previous study estimated from sequences of seven hsy bacs where it was 54%  <cit> , which might be due to uneven distribution of ty3-gypsy elements throughout the hsy. on the other hand, the ty1-copia elements were less abundant compared to ty3-gypsy in both the hsy and the corresponding x . ty1-copia content in the corresponding x was  <dig> % higher than that in the hsy , suggesting that ty1-copia elements were not a major contributor to repeat accumulation in both the hsy and the corresponding x. this result is different from the retroelement accumulation in s. latifolia y chromosome where ty1-copia elements are more abundant than ty3-gypsy elements  <cit> . it could be due to the incomplete sequences of s. latifolia y chromosome or the feature of the very early evolutionary stage of homomorphic yh chromosome in c. papaya compared to heteromorphic y chromosome such as in s. latifolia, rumen acetosella, and marchantia polymorpha.

decreased ssr frequency in the sex determining region
ssr density was significantly lower in the hsy and in the corresponding x compared to that in papaya or v. monoica genomes  due to the increase of the overall repetitive sequence and the decrease of gene content  <cit> . these results suggest that the hsy is less vulnerable to mutation caused by replication slippage compared to other chromosome regions to maintain its unique sequence feature. class i and class ii densities in v. monoica bac sequences were comparable to those in v. monoica shotgun genome, whereas those densities in the sex determining region were much lower than those in the papaya genome , indicating that low ssr density in the hsy and the corresponding x was most likely caused by the process of the evolution of papaya sex chromosomes accompanied by the insertion of repetitive sequences. the density of class i ssr  in the hsy was lower than the rest, suggesting that the longer ssrs might be more susceptible to degeneration in the hsy.

sex-specific repeats
papaya sex types are determined by a small non-recombining region of recently evolved sex chromosomes  <cit> . the suppression of recombination in the hsy accompanies the accumulation of repetitive sequences and chromosomal rearrangements. these changes might ultimately result in the evolution of sex-specific repeats and the differentiation of sex chromosomes from their ancestral autosomes. phylogenetic analysis and mantel test of three sex-specific repeats, hsy-r <dig>  hsy-r <dig>  and x-r <dig>  revealed that the distance and sequence similarity among copies of each repeat had no correlation , indicating that the insertion of repeats occurred either in a random manner regardless of the physical distance between original and new target sites or rearrangements occurred after tandem duplications. the hsy-r <dig> and hsy-r <dig> did not show any similar sequence match from the ncbi nucleotide database and tigr plant repeat database . however, many hsy-r <dig> flanking sequences  showed similarity to chloroplast dna of papaya and other plant species , suggesting that the possible origin of hsy-r <dig> might be associated with chloroplast dna insertions. dna fragments transferring from organelles are not rare. for example, there is over 100 kb chloroplast dna in rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . the papaya genome also contains nearly 1 mb chloroplast dna  <cit> . the papaya hsy accumulated a staggering amount of chloroplast dna due to its lack of recombination with the corresponding x chromosome. the chloroplast dna insertion could be another means of sex chromosome evolution.

several sex-specific repeats were identified in other plant species, such as the raysi - iii family in the plant rumex acetosa <cit> , madc <dig> in cannabis sativa <cit> , and the tandem y-specific dna repeats in marchantia polymorpha <cit> . the raysi-iii family is satellite dnas and madc <dig> is homologous to line-like retrotransposons with a site-specific accumulation of the long arm of the y chromosome  <cit> . like the y-specific repeats in m. polymorpha <cit> , the hsy-r <dig> and hsy-r <dig> were identified as sex-specific repeats and exhibited no similarity to any known repetitive sequences such as retroelements or satellite dnas, indicating that these repeats are specific to the sex determining region of the papaya genome.

the y-specific repeats of m. polymorpha are not only tandemly duplicated, but also contain male-specific genes  <cit> . in humans, it was also reported that the active gene could be multiplied as a result of tandem duplications and large sequence inversions, such as the azfc region of the y chromosome  <cit>  and the znf <dig> gene family in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we identified a potential x-specific repeat x-r <dig>  which contained the third exon of a papaya zinc finger protein . the tandem duplication of x-r <dig> was quite similar to the znf <dig> subfamily of primate-specific zinc finger genes, consisting of large gene clusters with some dysfunctional copies  <cit> . another interesting feature of the znf <dig> gene family was that the large gene clusters are located near the centromere of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . in papaya, gene duplication was reported  <cit> , and some of those genes may be clustered as similar to the znf  <dig> gene family. nevertheless, this finding raises questions about whether the x-r <dig> repeats are located near the centromere of papaya x chromosome and whether the duplication of the x-r <dig> passed through a similar process as znf <dig> after duplication, such as loss of function and alternative splicing. these questions remain to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
we analyzed repetitive sequences and sex-specific repeats accumulated in the hsy and its x counterpart of papaya sex chromosomes. the sequences of the hsy and the corresponding x were highly repetitive as 77% of the hsy and 64% of the x counterpart sequences were found to be repetitive, of which the major repeat element was ty3-gypsy. the hsy and its x counterpart contained sex-specific repeats, including  <dig> hsy-specific repeats and one x-specific repeat. most hsy-specific repeats exhibited accumulation at specific locations in the hsy, where the hsy expansions took place. the hsy expanded at an accelerated pace compared to its x counterpart and the hsy-specific repeats contributed to its rapid expansion.
