BACKGROUND
most bacteria can live in individual or community lifestyles. in the planktonic mode of growth, bacterial cells are free to move in suspension, whereas in the sessile state, they form surface-attached multicellular communities called biofilms. this dynamic heterogenic organization confers to its residents a powerful tolerance against stresses and facilitates symbiotic relationships between members of the communities  <cit> . the transition between the planktonic and sessile modes of growth, as well as the biofilm development process are governed by environmental cues and the coordination of various molecular pathways linked notably to secondary messenger cyclic di-gmp and quorum sensing  <cit> . biofilm development progresses in three stages: i) bacterial attachment to a surface and formation of a monolayer biofilm, ii) maturation of the biofilm and emergence of a three-dimensional structure and iii) dispersion from mature biofilm.

the adhesion of planktonic cells to the surface is mostly driven by surface-exposed components like flagella, fimbriae and curli as observed in many bacteria  <cit> . subsequent biofilm maturation is concomitant with the formation of an extracellular matrix composed of exopolysaccharides, dna, lipids and proteins  <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, exopolysaccharides and extracellular dna also play a crucial role in the maturation process as the absence of these compounds severely impairs the formation of a three-dimensional structure  <cit> .

the last step of the biofilm developmental process, dispersion from mature biofilm, constitutes an essential stage because of its crucial role in bacterial dissemination and colonization of new surfaces  <cit> . it remains therefore unclear whether bacteria dispersed from biofilms represent or not a transition stage between biofilm and the planktonic lifestyle. dispersion occurs either as individual cells or clumps  <cit> , but the molecular mechanisms and effectors behind this process are still poorly documented  <cit> . nevertheless, secreted effectors such as glycosidases in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans  <cit> , proteases in pseudomonas putida  <cit> , nucleases in haemophilus influenzae  <cit>  and biosurfactants in staphylococcus  <cit>  are able to destabilize the biofilm structure and promote dispersion. activation of prophages in p. aeruginosa and enterococcus faecalis was also reported as inducing cell death inside microcolonies leading to biofilm dispersion  <cit> .

despite the accumulation of data concerning the transcriptional profile of bacteria grown in different experimental models, there has been no documented overview of all states of biofilm development and dispersion. transcriptomic approaches by microarray or rna sequencing have attempted to address this issue in several bacterial species like e. coli, p. aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii, and showed distinct expression profiles between sessile and planktonic stages. however, cells from dispersed biofilm were not included in these analyses .

the aim of this study was to identify the transcriptional landscape of the bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae across different experimental growth states, i.e. planktonic, sessile, and spontaneously biofilm-detached bacteria. k. pneumoniae is an ubiquitous bacterium found both in nature and in clinical environments; the molecular mechanisms leading to biofilm formation have been previously investigated, mostly by punctual mutant analysis  <cit> . in this work, comparison of the different whole transcriptomes obtained by rna-seq showed that each lifestyle of k. pneumoniae was associated with a unique transcriptional behavior. the comprehensive overview provided by this study allowed the identification of specific transcriptional fingerprints for each state, including the biofilm-dispersed cells.

RESULTS
monitoring of biofilm development in a flow-cell model
monitoring of biofilm development by k. pneumoniae ch <dig> in a flow-cell system with confocal microscopy showed initially the formation of microcolonies leading to the development of a flat structure after 7 h of incubation  . at t9h, a three-dimensional structure was observable and potential detachment from this mature biofilm was then assessed. bacteria in the flow-cell effluent were harvested throughout the experiment, and cfu determination of the resulting suspensions indicated that the number of viable cells decreased in the first 3 h of the experiment, from  <dig>  cfu/ml  to  <dig>  , owing probably to the elimination of planktonic non-adhering cells . observation of the harvested samples by optical microscopy revealed mainly individual bacteria . from t3h to t6h, the number of viable bacteria in the effluent increased rapidly and then progressively in the following 10 h  . microscopic observations revealed a progressive appearance of bacterial aggregates in the effluent, which predominated over individual cells after 12 h of incubation .fig.  <dig> number of viable bacteria in the flow-cell effluent. a the flow-cell with one chamber was inoculated with  <dig> cells from an overnight culture of k. pneumoniae ch <dig>  and viable bacteria in the effluent were counted by plating every hour for 16 h. b light microscopy observation of bacteria in the effluent after 12 h of incubation revealed the predominance of bacterial aggregates over individual cells



planktonic, sessile, and biofilm-detached bacteria presented distinct transcriptional profiles
transcriptional analysis was performed with sessile bacterial cells collected before and after the formation of a three-dimensional structure, at t7h and t13h, respectively. detached cells isolated in the flow-cell effluent , exponential and stationary growing planktonic cells were also included. rnaseq analysis indicated that  <dig>  <dig> of the  <dig>  <dig> cds of k. pneumoniae, as well as  <dig> of the  <dig> annotated ncrna genes , were differentially expressed in at least one of the ten possible pairs of conditions  , with fold-changes ranging from − <dig>  <dig> to  <dig>  <dig> . to validate the rna-seq efficiency,  <dig> genes differentially expressed between the 13 h-old biofilm bacteria and the bacteria collected in the effluent  were randomly selected. their relative expression levels were determined by rt-qpcr with total rna extracted from cells harvested in two conditions: bacteria in the effluent and 13 h-old biofilm. results indicated a high correlation between rnaseq and rt-qpcr data  .fig.  <dig> comparison of the k. pneumoniae ch <dig> gene expression levels across the different conditions. a the expression levels of the  <dig>  <dig> cds and the  <dig> ncrna genes of the k. pneumoniae ch <dig> genome were compared in each of the  <dig> possible pairs of conditions. the number of differentially expressed  cds and the number of ncrna genes, shown in parentheses, are indicated for each comparison. b principal component analysis  of gene expression in the five growth conditions. pca was performed with z-score values of the  <dig>  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes differentially expressed  in at least one of the  <dig> possible pairs of conditions. z-score values were calculated with absolute expression values normalized by the deseq package, and were used as a matrix to perform a pca with package factominer of r/bioconductor. each dot indicates a biological replicate. the lists of these  <dig>  <dig> cds and the  <dig> ncrna genes are provided respectively in additional file 2: table s <dig> and additional file 3: table s2



pca performed with z-score values of the  <dig>  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes indicated that the first principal component  accounted for  <dig>  % and the second principal component  for  <dig>  % of the total variation in the dataset . a plot of these z-score values against a heatmap  and the proximity of points in the pca  demonstrated the high reproducibility of the data among the replicates. in addition, such analysis clearly indicated that all bacterial states  exhibited specific transcriptional profiles , and suggests that bacterial cells in the effluent are not pieces of biofilm mechanically detached from the biomass. hereafter they will be referred to as biofilm-dispersed cells.

the transcriptome of the biofilm-dispersed cells presented only  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes differentially expressed  when compared with those of the 7 h-old biofilm state. in contrast,  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes,  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes, and  <dig>  <dig> cds and  <dig> ncrna genes were differentially expressed  when compared with those of exponential planktonic state, 13 h-old biofilm and stationary planktonic state, respectively . hence, biofilm-dispersed cells harbored a distinct transcriptional profile, which was closer to that of bacteria from 7 h-old biofilm than to that of 13 h-old biofilm and planktonic cells.

gene functional classification of k. pneumoniae lifestyles through k-means clustering
k-means clustering was then used to visualize the distribution of the expression levels of the  <dig>  <dig> cds and the  <dig> ncrna genes differentially expressed  in the different conditions . owing to the high reproducibility of data, z-score values were able to be calculated with average values from normalized deseq counts. this clustering indicated that the clearest representation was obtained with k =  <dig> for the cds analysis and k =  <dig> for the ncrna genes analysis, and showed different transcriptomic profiles between conditions. in fig. 3a, with clusters ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> cds for clusters  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, column clustering confirmed that dispersed cells were transcriptionally closer to 7 h-old biofilm cells than to those in all the other conditions, whereas stationary phase cells were the most different group of this dataset.fig.  <dig> k-means clustering of the z-score values of each differentially expressed cds and ncrna genes in the five different growth conditions, and clusters of orthologous group  affiliation of the cds of each k-means cluster. a heatmap depicting the k-means clustering of the  <dig>  <dig> differentially expressed cds in  <dig> clusters with column hierarchical clustering. the average z-scores of the  <dig> clusters was calculated for each condition, and the  <dig> clusters presenting an average z-score value >  <dig> or < − <dig> were framed. blue and red clusters gathered genes under- or overexpressed compared to the mean, respectively  k-means clustering of the  <dig> differentially expressed ncrna genes in  <dig> clusters. locus tag of each ncrna gene, and its respective annotation in parentheses, are indicated. blue and red clusters gathered genes under- or overexpressed compared to the mean, respectively  clusters of orthologous group  affiliation of the cds of each k-means cluster. only cog categories containing more than 10 % of the cds of one cluster are presented. the circle size is proportional to the percentage of cds  affiliated to a cog category for one given cluster group. percentages in red correspond to the major part of each cluster. cog categories not presented are grouped in the “other cog” category. an exhaustive view of the cds composition of each cluster and their cog affiliation is provided in additional file 2: table s <dig> and in additional file 6: figure s3



in order to highlight groups of genes highly overexpressed or under-expressed in a specific condition, the mean of the z-scores in each cluster in the fig. 3a was calculated for each condition. only the z-score groups presenting a mean value >  <dig> or < − <dig>  named overexpressed boxes and under-expressed boxes, respectively , were considered thereafter. all clusters presented only one overexpressed box, but clusters  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> also presented one under-expressed box .

aonly the two most representative cog affiliations of each cluster were displayed



identification of a set of signature genes for each condition
since clustering suggested the existence of specific signature genes for each condition, different stringent threshold fold-changes were applied to extract the most relevant transcriptional signature genes, up- or down-regulated, for each condition . forty signature cds were identified,  <dig> associated with the exponential and the stationary planktonic states,  <dig> with the 7 h-old and the 13 h-old biofilm cells, and  <dig> with biofilm dispersal . in the stationary planktonic and 13 h-old biofilm conditions, all signature cds were upregulated, and in the 7 h-old biofilm condition, all were down-regulated, whereas exponential planktonic cells and biofilm-dispersed cells displayed both up- and down-regulated signature cds . the z-score values of these  <dig> cds plotted against a heatmap  and their relative expression level  confirmed their signature singularity. putative functions of these protein encoding signatures cds are listed in table  <dig> and concern mainly transport, transcriptional regulation and metabolic pathways.table  <dig> list of the  <dig> selected signature genes with their respective annotation and their deseq normalized counts for each experimental condition

discussion
in the present study, the transcriptional changes occurring in the course of k. pneumoniae biofilm formation and biofilm-detachment were characterized by rnaseq. to date, the few data available on biofilm dispersion were obtained with artificial dispersion signals such as c-di-gmp depletion  <cit> . in contrast, we investigated spontaneous biofilm-detached cells. results indicated that each of the tested k. pneumoniae lifestyles, i.e. planktonic , sessile  and biofilm-dispersed cells, exhibit unique and specific transcriptional profiles. the comprehensive overview presented in this study allowed the analysis of the transcriptional fate of all k. pneumoniae genes in different bacteria lifestyles.

the stationary planktonic mode of growth displayed the most particular pattern with  <dig> genes highly overexpressed in the k-means cluster  <dig>  entry in the stationary phase is the result of nutrient starvation and in consequence bacteria modulate the expression level of a considerable number of genes, many of them being under the control of the stationary-phase sigma s factor   <cit> . on the basis of a study referencing the  <dig> most rpos-dependent genes in stationary phase of a pathogenic e. coli strain  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes present in the k. pneumoniae genome were found in the k-means cluster  <dig>  including  <dig> transcriptional signature genes of the stationary phase , asta, astd and aste). overall, the predominance of σs-dependent genes upregulated in stationary phase cells emphasized the accuracy of our data. with  <dig>  <dig> differentially expressed genes, stationary planktonic cells were transcriptionally different from exponential planktonic cells , as reported elsewhere  <cit> . interestingly, three genes belonging to the same operon, cyda, cydb and ybgt , were under-expressed in exponential planktonic cells, and two of them, cyda and cydb, were selected as signature genes. in e. coli, the cyd operon encodes the three subunits of the cytochrome bd oxygen reductase complex, whose expression is induced under stressful growth conditions  <cit> . the non-nutrient-limited early planktonic mode of growth explains the under-expression of this complex but also, more generally, the under-expression of pathways involved in energy production and conversion .

the response regulator csgd, a master transcriptional regulator in biofilm formation, functions by assisting bacterial cells in transitioning from the planktonic stage to the multicellular state through the activation of expression of biofilm-linked genes  <cit> . accordingly, csgd encoding gene was  <dig> -fold overexpressed in 7 h-old biofilm compared to stationary planktonic growing cells, although its expression did not significantly change between the two sessile conditions. however, transcriptomic profiles of the 7 h-old and 13 h-old biofilm cells contained  <dig> differentially expressed cds  , which shows an evolution of the biofilm structure between these two time points and validates our experimental model. these findings are in agreement with those of previous studies showing distinct transcriptomic profiles in developing and confluent biofilm states  <cit> . genes of clusters  <dig> and  <dig> were specifically overexpressed in 7 h-old biofilm, showing that amino acid transport and metabolism  is an essential process during the biofilm growth, as observed previously . the bsss gene, encoding a biofilm regulator whose inactivation leads to an increase in both the biomass and thickness of biofilm in e. coli  <cit> , was an under-expressed signature gene of the 7 h-old biofilm condition. in a more mature biofilm, 13 h-old biofilm, the overexpression of genes involved in carbohydrate transport and metabolism  reflect the importance of sugar in the formation of the extracellular matrix, a crucial component for biofilm maturation  <cit> . the ibpa gene was identified among the overexpressed signature genes of the 13 h-old biofilm condition, and encodes a heat shock protein whose overexpression is crucial in e. coli during biofilm growth  <cit> .

the transcriptional pattern of bacteria harvested in the effluent was also specific. surprisingly, according to k-means column clustering and the number of differentially expressed genes in the different conditions, biofilm-dispersed cells were transcriptionally closer to the 7 h-old biofilm cells than to the planktonic cells. our results showed that dispersed cells represent a distinct stage in the bacteria lifecycle, different from both the planktonic and the biofilm states. environmental pressure could then influence the fate of these cells converting them either into planktonic cells as suggested by chua et al.  <cit>  or into new biofilm structures.

because spontaneously dispersed-cells were analyzed, the question of any potential input signal triggering the dispersion process was assessed. quorum-sensing signaling is important for the proper regulation of biofilm development in several species, including k. pneumoniae  <cit> . in our study, the operons lsracdbfg and lsrrk encoding the regulatory network for ai- <dig> did present a strong up-regulation between 7 h-old biofilm and 13 h-old biofilm conditions. interestingly, these genes were significantly under-expressed in dispersed cells compared to 13 h-old biofilm cells. since the lsracdbfg operon is transcriptionally regulated by both the lsrr repressor and the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system , its expression could depend on the availability of certain substrates and the global metabolic status of the cell  <cit> . in this way, our data suggested that lsr gene modulation and the subsequent down-regulation of the biofilm-linked genes trigger the dispersal process. biofilm dispersal involving high concentrations of extracellular ai- <dig> was recently reported in e. faecalis and has been shown to be associated with phages release by sessile cells  <cit> . a biofilm dispersal mechanism mediated by filamentous prophage-induced cell death has also been reported in p. aeruginosa  <cit> . in our study, among the  <dig> transcriptional signature genes of biofilm-dispersed cells, pspa and pspb, encoding phage shock proteins a and b, were overexpressed . since the phage-shock protein a was overproduced in e. coli during filamentous phage infection  <cit> , it is tempting to hypothesize that the overexpression of the pspabcde operon in k. pneumoniae dispersed cells is the consequence of bacteriophage activation, which leads to local cell death and therefore biofilm dispersal.

since c-di-gmp depletion plays an important role in the dispersal from mature biofilms in many species  <cit> , we analyzed the expression of genes encoding proteins containing ggdef  and eal domains , which catalyze the formation and the degradation of c-di-gmp, respectively. two diguanylate cyclases encoding genes  and one phosphodiesterase encoding gene  were, respectively, under- and overexpressed in dispersed cells compared to 13 h-old biofilm cells. the phosphodiesterase activity of mrkj in k. pneumoniae is an important factor in the regulation of type  <dig> fimbriae expression, which mediates the formation and disassembly of the biofilm  <cit> . among the other candidates potentially involved in the dispersal process, some degrading matrix enzyme-encoding genes were overexpressed in dispersed cells compared to 13 h-old biofilm, such as the protease-encoding gene ycbz, the glucosidase-encoding gene malz and the nucleases encoding genes enda, rnhb, nth, and yihg. interestingly, genes involved in the sos response  were also overexpressed in dispersed cells compared to 13 h-biofilm cells, suggesting a role of the stress response in biofilm dispersal. although sos stress response had not been directly related to biofilm dispersion, several studies reported the impact of nitrosative and nutrient stress on biofilm dispersal  <cit> . regarding the transcriptional status of the biofilm-dispersed cells,  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the overexpressed genes in the k-means clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, were categorized in the “translation, ribosomal structure and biogenesis” cog group . dispersal probably requires high metabolic activity, even higher than that of the exponential planktonic cells. indeed, only  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the genes categorized in the k-means clusters  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively , also belong to this cog group . however, ribosomal proteins could act not only in protein synthesis but also as regulators of the biofilm life cycle, as recently shown with the ribosomal proteins s <dig>  and s <dig>  in bacillus subtilis  <cit> . another interesting feature of dispersed cells was the overexpression of cusa , a member of the cuscfba operon encoding a cation tripartite efflux pump involved in the detoxification of cooper and silver ions in the periplasm of e. coli  <cit> . two cuscfba operons are present in the k. pneumoniae ch <dig> genome and both were specifically overexpressed in dispersed cells . because efflux systems have a major role in host colonization  <cit> , we can therefore hypothesize that k. pneumoniae dispersed cells display specific phenotypes with high adaptive ability to colonize a new hostile environment. this hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that ryee and t <dig>  ncrna genes, were overexpressed in dispersed cells ; ryee is upregulated in yersinia pestis during lung infection  <cit>  and the t <dig> expression level increases during initial invasion of fibroblast by salmonella serovar typhimurium  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
several works have already described the transcriptomic profile of biofilm cells  but none of them ever considered the overall cycle of bacterial life. the present study provides an exhaustive view of the transcriptional behavior of k. pneumoniae in the course of planktonic, biofilm formation and dispersion steps. by structuring data in clusters, we achieved a clear illustration of the specific expression profiles and functions, and identified signature genes as potential biomarkers of the different bacterial states. further research on the genes evidenced in our work will provide a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the transition between planktonic, sessile and dispersed states.
