BACKGROUND
the genomics community has been enormously revolutionized by first- and next generation sequencing  technologies  <cit>  that generated vast amounts of genetic data ranging from unicellular  to multicellular  genomes. however, no matter how good these technologies are, polymorphisms in a genome complicate the assembly process, results in lower quality, and the contiguity and completeness of assembly is significantly lower than would be expected from a homozygous template  <cit> . hence, there is a growing interest for the development of inbred lines, such as haploid and double haploid  lines, which are particularly advantageous in genomics  <cit>  because of their homozygosity and their growth potential. inbred lines are also useful in physical mapping  <cit>  and in genetic mapping  <cit>  which would enable precise positioning of the genes in the genome, and thus facilitate accurate identification of candidate genes. furthermore, dhs are also useful for mutagenesis and genetic transformation studies  <cit> .

an inbred line is normally produced by classical sibling mating which is not only time and space consuming, but also laborious and expensive, especially in organisms with long generation times. alternatively, it can be produced via androgenesis or gynogenesis which both requires inactivation of the genetic material through chemical means or by ionizing radiations. for species with relatively large eggs , with thick membrane that hardens upon contact with water and contains numerous oil globules like that of the three-spined stickleback, optimum inactivation of the genetic material of the eggs is difficult and hence gynogenesis should be favored. gynogenesis is defined by thorgaard  <cit>  as an all maternal type of inheritance wherein the genetic material of the sperm does not contribute to the resulting embryo. this process occurs naturally in some fish species like in crucian carp and in several species of poecilids  <cit> . induction of diploid gynogenesis involves egg activation by irradiated homologous or heterologous sperm, and diploidization by retention of the second polar body  or suppression of the first mitotic cleavage   <cit>  using strong physical treatments . the most commonly used treatments are either low or high temperatures  or hydrostatic pressure. under the influence of such treatments, the spindle fibers are destroyed and cell division stops resulting in the fusion of the daughter cells, thus forming diploid gynogenetic embryos. mitotic gynogenesis was regarded as the fastest way to produce dh . it requires only one round of gynogenetic manipulation. production of dhs via meiotic gynogenesis, on the other hand, requires an additional 2- <dig> rounds of gynogenetic manipulations. prior to the boom of the genomics era, artificial gynogenesis has already been applied in many fish species mainly because of its potential value in experimental genetics and aquaculture  <cit> . furthermore, it has played an important role in fish genetic improvement and control of reproduction  <cit> . for instance, diploid gynogenetic fish were observed to grow faster and have stronger resistance to disease than haploids  <cit> . successful gynogenetic manipulations were done, e.g., in rainbow trout  <cit> , medaka  <cit> , common carp  <cit> , muskellunge  <cit> , goldfish  <cit> , russian sturgeon and starlet  <cit> , mud loach  <cit> , sea lamprey  <cit> , and in wels- and channel catfish  <cit> .

the three-spined stickleback is a teleost that exhibits multiple examples of parallel evolution. it inhabits different marine, estuarine, and freshwater systems all over the northern hemisphere and is characterized by rapid and repeated ecological and phenotypic divergence from the marine ancestor to the freshwater forms  <cit> . like other model systems, the linkage and chromosome maps of this fish have already been published  <cit>  and its genome sequenced  <cit> . genomic information has now been used to understand many fundamental evolutionary problems. for instance, the successful elucidation of the evolution of body armor reduction in three-spined sticklebacks from the phenotypic down to the gene level  <cit>  prompted gibson  <cit>  to elevate the status of this species to an evolutionary supermodel. the advent of ngs has also advanced studies on the population genomics of this species  <cit> . however despite all these developments, the problem with polymorphism remains and left a significant part of the genome unassembled. thus, increasing the need for the production of an inbred three-spined stickleback.

in our knowledge, no inbred line is available in this species partly because the emphasis has always been on the study of natural populations. information about effective modification of genotype in this species was limited only to ploidy manipulation using temperature shock that resulted in the production of triploid and haploid individuals  <cit> . these haploids would be ideal for genomics but as in many attempts of fish haploid production, these haploids survived only until embryonic development  <cit>  or right after hatching  <cit>  and hence do not provide enough template material for downstream processing.

here, we present a working protocol for the induction of gynogenesis using a combination of sperm uv irradiation and heat shock  treatment. this study aims at producing inbred lines of the three-spined stickleback suited not only for whole genome sequencing, physical and genetic mapping but also for future mutagenesis and experimental studies. success of gynogenesis is confirmed by microsatellite dna analysis and the ploidy of the gynogenetic embryos/larvae is verified by flow cytometry.

RESULTS
screening for the optimum uv irradiation exposure
optimum uv irradiation of the sperms was done by exposing groups of sperms to the uv light source at various durations. uv irradiation of the sperms worked well for both  <dig> min and  <dig> min exposure with fertilization rates of 97% and 93%, respectively . all the embryos, however, developed abnormally and did not hatch. they were collected at day  <dig> or  <dig> for dna extraction. the sperms irradiated for  <dig> and  <dig> minutes failed to activate the stickleback eggs, thus no embryo was produced. this suggests that long exposure to uv irradiation could already be lethal to three-spined stickleback sperms as evidenced by the presence of non-motile sperms after irradiation in these treatment groups.

the normal controls, on the other hand, were not only successfully fertilized but also have high percentage of survival to the eyed stage  and hatched as expected at day  <dig> or  <dig> 

effects of heat shock on chromosome diploidization of the activated stickleback eggs
the effectiveness of heat shock  in promoting diploid gynogenesis, expressed by the number of gynogens produced , was clearly shown in two separate experiments. gynogen yield was computed as the percentage of hatched, surviving fry over the total number of fertilized embryos.

in the first experiment, the optimal initiation time of heat shock was established to be at  <dig> minutes post fertilization  in combination with heat shock at 34°c for  <dig> minutes. this treatment group produced the highest diploid gynogen yield of 22% . a low gynogen yield of 3% was also observed in the treatment group subjected to 30°c applied  <dig> mpf . the rest of the treatments produced low yields of diploid gynogens .

using the previously established hs initiation time of  <dig> mpf and uv irradiation of  <dig> min, optimal temperature and duration for applying hs was found to be at 34°c for  <dig> minutes. this treatment group produced a much improved gynogen yield of 65%  while the remaining groups that were heat shocked at 30°c and 38°c for shorter  and longer  both yielded low diploid gynogenetic fry . in addition to hs initiation time  and hs duration , hs temperature  was also found to contribute statistically significant effects on the induction of diploid gynogenesis in three-spined stickleback.

all embryos in the hs controls developed into abnormal embryos/larvae which indicated that uv irradiation for  <dig> min successfully inactivated the genetic material of the sperms but retained the ability to induce the development of the eggs. such haploid  eggs develop abnormally in the absence of hs treatment but become morphologically normal  when optimal hs condition was applied to them.

microsatellite dna analysis of gynogenetic families
using the here established optimal condition for stickleback diploid gynogenesis induction, additional six gynogenetic families designated family 1- <dig> were produced for microsatellite analyses. in families  <dig> -  <dig>  all gynogenetic embryos/larvae were collected at day  <dig> and used to assess level of heterozygosity in the gynogenetic individuals. families  <dig> and  <dig> were used to determine the type of gynogenesis that was induced in this experiment, hence only the embryos/larvae that hatched and survived past  <dig> days were collected and tested. in general, all the gynogenetic embryos/larvae subjected to microsatellite analysis using  <dig> loci were found to carry only the maternal alleles and as expected all the normal controls had biparental genotypes. data from the four gynogenetic families produced to assess genetic homogeneity of the resulting gynogens revealed that families  <dig> to  <dig> had statistically significant lower heterozygosity index values compared to normal control fish . as shown in figure  <dig>  the microsatellite data were analyzed in two ways: 1) by using the whole dataset and 2) by excluding individuals homozygous for allele shared by both parents . in both cases, gynogens were found to be more homozygous than the control fish. the degree of individual homozygosity, though, was further intensified when alleles shared by both parents were excluded in the test .

moreover, in families  <dig> and  <dig> , 97-100% of the samples were heterozygous for the maternal alleles. this suggests that majority of the gynogens are meiotic diploids produced by retention of the second polar body. the remaining 3% found to be homozygous for the maternal alleles could be mitotic gynogens produced by inhibiting first mitotic division. these embryos can be good candidate for a completely homozygous inbred fish.

ploidy level of gynogenetic fry
a total of  <dig> gynogenetic and  <dig> normal control embryos/larvae were subjected to flow cytometry for relative dna quantification. of the  <dig> gynogenetic embryos/larvae,  <dig> exhibited abnormal features while the remaining  <dig> were morphologically normal. a histogram of the relative dna content of a haploid  embryo is illustrated in figure  <dig>  it had a dominant peak at mean channel  <dig> which indicates that most of the cells are in the n phase and a minor peak at mean channel  <dig> representing cells in the n phase of the cell cycle. also shown is a histogram of a diploid embryo characterized by a prominent peak at channel  <dig>  the ploidy of the sample is reflected by the dominant peak suggesting that abnormal embryos are haploid  and the morphologically normal gynogens are diploid  with twice as much genetic material as the latter.

development of the gynogenetic embryos/larvae
the daily larval development of representative stickleback embryos activated with uv-irradiated sperm and with further hs treatment at 34°c for  <dig> minutes  <dig> mpf was monitored for one week . the diploid embryo in figure 5a followed normal development as described by kuntz & radcliffe  <cit> . however the growth of the haploid embryo started to slow down  <dig> hours after fertilization. it managed to cover only one half of the circumference of the yolk sac and growth from here on was restricted horizontally increasing the volume of the fish but not its length . the diploid embryos hatched at day  <dig> or  <dig> post fertilization, whereas haploid embryos did not hatch and remained within their enveloping membrane until they die. death of the haploid embryo could be attributed to the many deformities observed mainly in the head and tail regions, as well as in the abdomen where the yolk sac is attached . tissue degeneration at the abdominal region prevents absorption of the yolk sac thereby cutting the source of nutrients of the developing embryo leading to the death of the embryo.

discussion
gynogenesis is regarded as a powerful tool in the production of an all female progeny, in studying mechanisms of sex determination, and in the production of completely inbred lines. inbred lines are useful for whole genome sequencing and for production of mutational and developmental genetic screens. for an evolutionary model organism like the three-spined stickleback, optimization of this method will be immensely important.

in this study, uv irradiation of the sperm and heat shock  of the resulting embryos were used to induce gynogenesis. uv irradiation was used because aside from being effective in deactivating the dna of the sperm, it is cheap and easy to set-up as compared to ionizing irradiations which are more dangerous and require special containment area  <cit> . since dna irradiation is a key step to successful gynogenesis, it is therefore important to determine optimal condition for sperm irradiation. uv irradiation should inactivate the sperm dna maximally and avoids chromosome fragmentation, because partially inactivated sperm dna interferes in the embryonic development whereas over-exposure to uv light may already kill the sperm  <cit> . in this study,  <dig> to  <dig> minutes exposure to uv irradiation can be regarded as optimal with fertilization success of 93-97%. all the resulting embryos were morphological abnormal , confirmed to be haploids by flow cytometry, and had only the maternal genotype. however, uv exposure of more than  <dig> min in our case was already lethal to the sperms resulting in zero fertilization success. this was also indicated by the observed absence of sperm motility in these treatment groups after uv exposure. although both  <dig> and  <dig> min uv irradiations were successful in inactivating the genetic material of the sperm, we used the former in the succeeding experiments to minimize possible "hertwig effect" wherein haploid embryos resulting from the total destruction of the genetic material in the sperm by high doses of radiation would survive longer than those exposed to lower uv dosage  <cit> .

application of hs was observed to be effective for the retention of the second polar body in eggs activated with uv irradiated sperms resulting in morphologically normal gynogenetic diploid larvae  <cit> . for hs to be successful, right combination of the different parameters namely temperature, duration, and initiation time of application is critical. from the review of komen & thorgaard  <cit> , it is suggested that optimal temperature for hs is species-specific and could vary from 30°c to up to 42°c. since hs acts through depolymerization of protein complexes, then the best temperature should be close to the upper limit of tolerance. likewise, optimal time for applying heat appears to be slightly different  <cit> . timing of hs is very crucial as this decides the kind of gynogens produced. generally, when hs is applied early, it targets second meiotic division leading to the retention of the second polar body, thereby producing diploid meiotic gynogens. late application of heat treatment, on the other hand, results in suppression of the first mitotic cleavage, producing an all homozygote female fry . here, the best yield of diploid gynogens  was observed in eggs activated with uv irradiated sperm and heat shocked at 34°c  <dig> minutes post fertilization  for  <dig> minutes . although aiming at different end products, the optimal temperature and duration of hs established here correspond to what was used by swarup  <cit>  in his first attempt to produce haploid and triploid three-spined sticklebacks without uv irradiation. independently tested, this clearly shows that hs at 34°c for  <dig> minutes can effectively destabilize and disorganize the microtubules of activated stickleback egg, thereby facilitating diploid gynogenesis. the comparatively low diploid gynogen yields at lower  and higher  temperatures indicates that 30°c can still be well tolerated by the developing embryo. the effect of temperature shock at 30°c is very minimal, whereas shock at 38°c could have already interfered in a wider range of developmental mechanisms resulting to further abnormalities that drives the embryos to death. like in common carp  <cit> , the present study clearly demonstrated that temperature, duration, and initiation time of hs play an important role in the success of diploid gynogenesis in three-spined sticklebacks.

success of gynogenesis induction in three-spined stickleback is verified by microsatellite analysis. microsatellite dna technology is commonly used because of its pcr-based, co-dominant mendelian inheritance, and highly polymorphic characteristics which facilitate molecular typing of the gynogenetic embryos/larvae  <cit> . success is measured by the absence of paternal alleles in the resulting gynogenetic individuals. in the six families tested here, it was clear that the paternal alleles are absent and only the maternal alleles are passed on to the gynogenetic embryos/larvae. the predominance of heterozygotes  for the maternal alleles only suggests that the established optimum hs condition promotes retention of the second polar body, thereby producing mostly heterozygous meiotic diploid gynogens which have the expected high degree of homozygosity . with the relatively early timing of heat shock  and due to the mode of egg collection , it could be that the eggs used in this study are still undergoing meiosis when the hs was applied. flow cytometry remains the best method for ploidy determination in gynogenetic stickleback. this method clearly shows that stickleback gynogenetic embryos/larvae that developed normally were diploids  whereas those that showed abnormalities were haploids  with peaks at mean channel numbers  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . we observed no mosaic or aneuploid, chromosomal anomalies that are also reliably detected through flow cytometry. with the accuracy of the result obtained here, we find no reason to use more laborious and time consuming classical methods of ploidy determination like chromosome preparation and silver staining of nuclear organizer regions . since in the present study, possible effects of doublets on fluorescence were excluded in all samples, the observed predominance of haploid cells at n phase with a significant 5% of the cells staying at the n is quite striking . this is comparable to what was observed in muskellunge by lin and dabrowski  <cit>  which suggests that haploid cells have an abnormal cell cycle that probably takes longer in time than that of their diploid counterparts. this could also mean production of lower cell numbers, hence the observed stunted growth of haploids.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, a working protocol for the induction of diploid meiotic gynogenesis in three-spined sticklebacks is presented in this study. the optimal condition for the inactivation of the sperm and the hs treatment to effectively suppress the second meiotic division in stickleback eggs were established to be at  <dig> minutes uv irradiation and hs at 34°c  <dig> mpf for  <dig> minutes, respectively. flow cytometry and microsatellites analysis proved to be an ideal combination of methods to determine the ploidy and the all maternal inheritance in the gynogenetic individuals produced.
