BACKGROUND
alg- <dig>  is a 22-kda protein of  <dig> amino acid residues containing five serially repetitive ef-hand-type helix-loop-helix ca2+-binding motifs  and it belongs to the penta-ef-hand  family, including the calpain small subunit, sorcin, grancalcin and peflin in mammals  <cit> . alg- <dig> is the most conserved protein among the pef family and its homologues are widely found in eukaryotes. despite the original report of a pro-apoptotic function of alg- <dig> in t cell hybridomas  <cit> , alg-2-deficient mice develop normally with no obvious abnormalities in the immune system  <cit> . nonetheless, potential physiological roles of alg- <dig> in control of er-stress-induced apoptosis, cancer and cell division have been reported  <cit> . alix  was the first protein identified as an alg-2-interacting protein  <cit> . this cytoplasmic 95-kda protein is now recognized as an auxiliary factor of the escrt  system, which is involved in endosomal sorting, retrovirus budding and cytokinesis  <cit> . in addition to roles in the escrt system, alix functions in actin-cytoskeleton assembly, cell adhesion, signal transduction and apoptosis  <cit> .

x-ray crystal structures of various pef proteins including alg- <dig> have common features: the presence of eight α-helices and dimer formation via paired ef5s that are positioned in anti-parallel orientation  <cit> . previously, we solved the structures of ca2+-free and -bound forms of n-terminally truncated human alg- <dig>  and a zn2+-bound form of full-length alg- <dig> as well as the structure of the complex between des3-23alg- <dig> and the peptide corresponding to alix799- <dig> in the zn2+-bound form. although the four-ef-hand-region  of alg- <dig> has a general structural resemblance to calmodulin, alg- <dig> exhibits only a very small ca2+-dependent conformational change. binding of ca2+  to ef <dig> enables the side chain of r <dig>  present in the loop connecting ef <dig> and ef <dig>  to move enough to make a primary hydrophobic pocket  accessible to the critical ppyp motif found in alix. this ca2+/ef3-driven arginine switch mechanism explains how alg- <dig> is activated by ca2+ to bind to its target proteins  <cit> . the c-terminal half of the alix peptide is also held in the second hydrophobic pocket . on the other hand, in the case of calmodulin, each pair of ef1-ef <dig>  and ef3-ef <dig>  changes its conformation from "closed" to "open" state upon ca2+ binding and exhibits a further gross change in relative stereotypic position by bending of the central helix connecting ef <dig> and ef <dig> in such a way that the two lobes grab the targeting peptide  <cit> .

an isoform of alg- <dig> was first reported in the mouse  <cit> . the isolated cdna clone designated alg- <dig>  was shorter in six nucleotides corresponding to the two amino acids gly121phe <dig> in comparison with the full-length cdna clone alg- <dig> . both transcripts were present in mouse tissues at an approximate ratio of 2: <dig> . the same type of isoform lacking gly <dig> phe <dig>  is also registered in human dna databases, such as genbank under accession no. bc <dig> . interaction of alg-2Δgf <dig> with alix is significantly reduced or not detected in yeast two-hybrid or in vitro binding assays  <cit> . although f <dig> interacts with the alg-2-binding site  peptide of alix in pocket  <dig> in the crystal structure  <cit> , the molecular basis for the defect of alg-2Δgf <dig> in binding to alix has remained to be elucidated. in the present study, we crystallized des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> and compared its x-ray crystal structure with that of the ca2+-bound form of des3-23alg- <dig>  we found that deletion of the two residues causes shortening of an α-helix  and leads to a change in the configuration of the r <dig> side chain. surprisingly, however, the f122a mutant  exhibited an unexpected hyperactivity in alix-binding. we also investigated effects of this mutation on the crystal structure, and we discuss the structural roles of f <dig> in this article.

RESULTS
structures of alg-2Δgf <dig> and alg-2f122a
for determination of the 3d structures of alg-2Δgf <dig> and alg-2f122a, we prepared recombinant proteins with deletion in the n-terminal gly/pro-rich region . crystal structures were solved by the molecular replacement method using the previously solved structures of alg- <dig>  as a search model. data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in table  <dig>  the structures of des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> in the ca2+-bound form  and des3-20alg-2f122a in the zn2+-bound form  were solved at resolutions of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively. although the obtained data of 3aak were processed to  <dig>  Å, the refinement gave poor rwork and rfree values . thus, we limited the resolution to  <dig>  Å . an asymmetric unit of the crystal of des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> in the ca2+-bound form contained two alg- <dig> molecules  as a dimer . the root-mean-square deviation  value of the structures aligned between two molecules was calculated to be  <dig>  Å for cα atoms from residues l <dig> to v <dig>  the structure of molecule a was used for further analysis. crystals of the ca2+-free and ca2+-bound forms of des3-20alg-2f122a suitable for x-ray diffraction were not obtained.

a values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.

the basic architectures of the pef domain containing eight α-helices , five ef-hand-like helix-loop-helix motifs , and pairing at ef <dig> as a dimer were maintained in the solved crystal structures , and the overall structures were very similar when compared with those of wild-type alg- <dig> in the ca2+-bound form of des3-20alg- <dig>  and the zn2+-bound form of full-length alg- <dig> , respectively . in des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig>  however, the deletion of gly121phe <dig> caused loss of the third turn in α <dig> that corresponds to the exiting helix of ef <dig> . the loop connecting α <dig> of ef <dig> and α <dig> of ef <dig> started earlier, but it returned to a similar spatial position in the middle of the loop around y <dig>  corresponding to y <dig> in wild-type alg- <dig> . this spatial position of y <dig> was supported partly by hydrogen bonding between the nitrogen atom of y <dig>  and the peptide carbonyl oxygen atom of l <dig>  and partly by hydrophobic interactions between cβ of y <dig> and cδ <dig> of l <dig> as in the case of y <dig> of wild-type alg- <dig> . while hydrogen bonding between the hydroxyl oxygen atom  of y <dig>  and the side chain amide nitrogen atom  of q <dig>  in α <dig> was newly formed, hydrophobic interactions between side chains of y <dig> and l <dig> were reduced in the Δgf <dig> isoform. in the crystal structure of des3-20alg-2f122a in the zn2+-bound form, the axis of α <dig> inclined slightly outward from α <dig> and α <dig>  .

configuration of r <dig> side chain
in the previously proposed ca2+/ef3-driven arginine switch mechanism  <cit> , binding of ca2+ to ef <dig> enables formation of a hydrogen bond between one of the guanidino nitrogen atoms  of r <dig>  and the peptide carbonyl oxygen atom of s <dig> , resulting in change in the configuration of the r <dig> side chain . binding of zn2+ caused the same effect   <cit> . in the structure of des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> in the ca2+-bound form, however, nh2r <dig>  did not form such a hydrogen bond . the side chain extended outwardly from the loop as in the case of the structure of the metal-free form, but the spatial positions of the side chains between r <dig> and y <dig> were closer in the equivalent residues in the metal-free alg- <dig>  . the lower electron densities corresponding to guanidino group atoms of r <dig> suggest flexibility of this side chain by solvent exposure. on the other hand, nh2r <dig> in the structure of zn2+-bound des3-20alg-2f122a formed a hydrogen bond with os <dig>  and the side chain of r <dig> showed a configuration similar to that of wild-type alg- <dig> .

metal coordination
three calcium ions were found in ef <dig>  ef <dig> and ef <dig> of des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> at the canonical ef-hand coordination positions , though water molecules at the -x positions in ef <dig> and ef <dig> were absent and no amino acid residue coordinated at the -z position in ef <dig> . in addition to two zinc ions found in ef <dig> and ef <dig> at the canonical coordination positions , one zinc ion that was coordinated at a non-canonical position was found in ef <dig> in the structure of zn2+-bound des3-20alg-2f122a . in this non-canonical ef-hand coordination, zinc ion was bonded to od1d <dig> and od2d <dig> in place of od1d <dig> and ow <dig>  respectively, at the x and -y positions. interestingly, the ca2+-bound form and the zn2+-bound form displayed an opposite relationship regarding the presence of water molecules at -x positions in wild-type alg- <dig> between ef <dig> and ef <dig>  . in the zn2+-bound form of alg-2f122a, a water molecule was found at this position in ef <dig>  the difference in ion radius between calcium and zinc  may influence the availability of coordinated water molecules at the -x position.

comparison of surface structures
as shown in figure  <dig>  the deletion of two residues caused a noticeable change in the surface structure surrounding hydrophobic pockets , which were shown to accommodate the alix abs peptide in our previous study  <cit> . the bottom of pocket  <dig> was supported by y <dig> derived from a dimerizing counterpart molecule of alg- <dig> . a wall formed by gly121phe <dig> in des3-20alg-2/ca2+-bound  disappeared in des3-23alg-2Δgf122/ca2+-bound, and a surface structure represented by g <dig> was also changed  the continuous wall formed by 121-gfg- <dig> was maintained in zn2+-bound des3-20alg-2f122a . the r <dig> side chain  was oriented away from pocket  <dig> in the metal-bound alg- <dig> proteins . on the other hand, the side chain directed toward pocket  <dig> in ca2+-bound des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> , but it did not fully block the entry path of pocket  <dig> as in the case of metal-free alg- <dig> .

effects of amino acid substitutions of f <dig> on binding capacities and specificities
to investigate whether the side chain of f <dig> influences association between alg- <dig> and alix, we performed real-time surface plasmon resonance  interaction analyses using purified recombinant full-length alg- <dig> and f122-substituted mutants as well as alg-2Δgf <dig> as analytes and an alix abs peptide as a ligand. the resonance signals at  <dig> s before the dissociation phase were compared with that of wild-type  alg- <dig> and expressed as relative binding capacities . higher binding capacities were observed for the alg- <dig> mutants of f122a  and f122g , whereas lower binding capacities were observed for alg-2Δgf <dig>  and the mutants of f122w  and f122s .

next, we investigated whether substitutions of f <dig> equally influence binding to endogenous alg-2-interacting proteins by pulldown assays using glutathione-s-transferase -fused alg- <dig> proteins and unfused gst as a negative control  . pulldown products were analyzed by western blotting with specific antibodies against alix, tsg <dig>  sec31a, annexin a <dig> and annexin a <dig>  gst-alg-2Δgf <dig> gave essentially no specific immunoreactive signals except for sec31a. for alix interaction, the mutants of small side chain substitutions  gave stronger signals than those of wt and f122w mutant. compared to the results obtained by spr analyses , gst-pulldown assays gave much more enhanced signals for mutants than for wt. even f122w mutant gave a capacity similar to that of wt. capacities of alg- <dig> binding to tsg <dig> and sec31a were not different from wt in all f <dig> mutants. compared to wt, only f122a mutant gave significantly stronger signals for annexin a <dig>  whereas signals for annexin a <dig> were decreased in all mutants.

augmentation of staurosporine-induced cell death by expression of alg-2f122a
staurosporine, a microbial alkaloid, acts as a non-selective protein kinase inhibitor with high potency by binding to atp-binding pockets of kinases  <cit> , and it induces cell death via caspase-dependent and -independent apoptotic pathways  <cit> . previously, vito et al. reported that alg- <dig> and alix  modulate staurosporine-induced cell death  <cit> . to investigate whether the enhanced alix-binding capacity by f122a mutant exerts augmentation of cell death, we employed previously established alg-2-knockdown  hela cells whose endogenous alg- <dig> level was reduced by the rna interference  method  <cit> . after transfection with rnai-resistant expression plasmids of either wild-type or mutant alg- <dig> proteins or with a vector as a control, cells were treated with staurosporine for  <dig> h. the degree of cell death was estimated by measuring the amounts of lactate dehydrogenase  released into the culture medium. as shown in figure  <dig>  cells not treated with staurosporine released small amounts of ldh under the conditions used . on the other hand, dramatic increases were observed for the release of ldh from staurosporine-treated cells in all cases tested , but vector-transfected alg-2kd hela cells  showed lower values than vector-transfected parental hela cells . the amounts of released ldh were increased slightly by exogenous expressions of wild-type  alg- <dig>  and alg-2Δgf <dig>  in alg-2kd hela cells. the augmentation was statistically significant  when alg-2f122a was exogenously expressed  and compared with the vector-transfected alg-2kd hela cells .

discussion
a variant of alg- <dig> cdna lacking six nucleotides is found in human dna databases. since gly121phe <dig> is immediately followed by gly in the amino acid sequence, the deletion of phe122gly <dig> is assigned in the results of blast searches using the blastp or tblastn program. in the nucleotide sequence of cdnas, however, the deletion occurs in ggtttc  but not in ttcggc  in the sequence of tcaggtttcggctac . in the current human est database, the ratio of retrieved human alg- <dig> cdnas containing nucleotides corresponding to gly121phe <dig> and those lacking the corresponding hexanucleotides is approximately 3: <dig>  in this article, we designate the major alg- <dig> isoform as wild type  to discriminate it from the shorter and minor isoform. analysis of the human genome database revealed that the alg- <dig> gene  has six exons and that the boundary sequence of exon  <dig> and intron  <dig> contains an alternative splicing donor site . the alternatively spliced alg- <dig> isoform, designated alg-2Δgf <dig>  is defective in alix-binding  <cit> . these two residues  comprise the last turn in α <dig> in the crystal structures  <cit> . however, the structural basis for the inability of alg-2Δgf <dig> to bind alix has remained to be established. in the present study, we investigated the role of gly121phe <dig> by solving the x-ray crystal structure of the shorter isoform and by mutational analyses of f <dig> 

comparison of the crystal structures of des3-20alg- <dig> and des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig> in the ca2+-bound forms revealed a significant difference in spatial positions of residues adjacent to gly121phe <dig> . since s <dig> is located within α <dig> in alg- <dig> but is placed at the end of the truncated helix in alg-2Δgf <dig> , an α-helix-supporting hydrogen bond between os <dig> and ng <dig>  is disrupted . this causes a change in the spatial orientation of os <dig>  and the hydrogen bond with nh2r <dig> in wild-type alg- <dig> is lost in nh2r <dig> in alg-2Δgf <dig>  then, the side chain of r <dig> is placed to partially block pocket  <dig>  which is a primary acceptor site for the alix abs peptide  and resembles the topology of r <dig> in the ca2+-unbound  form of wild-type alg- <dig> . f <dig>  present in α <dig> , interacts with residues w <dig> and v <dig> in α <dig>  and stabilizes the ef-hand motif in metal-free des3-20alg- <dig> . this inter-helix interaction is maintained partly in the ca2+-bound form  and disrupted in ca2+-bound alg-2Δgf <dig> due to the absence of f <dig> . the distance between the cα atoms of y <dig> and t <dig>  is shorter in the crystal structure of des3-23alg-2Δgf <dig>  than that between the corresponding y <dig> and t <dig> in the ca2+-bound  and metal-free structure of des3-20alg- <dig> , indicating a narrower pocket  <dig> in the isoform. moreover, the main chain of g <dig> in wild-type alg- <dig>  is placed to face pocket  <dig>  and the main chain carbonyl carbon  interacts hydrophobically with the alix abs peptide  <cit> , but this interaction is no longer possible because a continuous wall formed by gly121phe <dig>  and g <dig>  is destroyed in alg-2Δgf <dig> .

our previous x-ray crystal structure analyses of the complex between alg- <dig> and the alix abs peptide  revealed that an aromatic moiety of f <dig>  constituting pocket  <dig>  interacts hydrophobically with y <dig> of the alix abs peptide  <cit> . surprisingly, however, substitution of f <dig> with ala or gly did not abolish the binding but instead increased the binding capacities as shown by spr analyses, and substitution with trp caused a decrease in the binding capacity . similar effects were observed by gst-pulldown assays of endogenous alix . thus, it is thought that the inability of alg-2Δgf <dig> to bind alix is not due to the absence of a residue with a large hydrophobic side chain at residue no.  <dig> but is due to the unfavorable topology of the loop connecting α <dig> and α <dig> caused by deletion of the two residues. this idea may also explain the finding by subramanian et al. that a single amino acid deletion of f <dig> caused a marked decrease in alix-binding capacity  <cit> . on the other hand, the presence of an aromatic bulky side chain at this position  may be rather detrimental for binding to alix due to steric hindrance. interestingly, substitution of either m <dig> or q <dig>  with ala resulted in higher alix-binding capacities  <cit> . thus, more open space or a deeper trough in pocket  <dig> seems to favor interactions with alix. the f122s mutant showed lower binding capacity  than that of wild-type alg- <dig> by spr analyses , but the gst-alg-2f122s mutant exhibited a higher capacity than that of the wild type in the gst-pulldown assay. this discrepancy may arise from the differences in the ligands to be assayed  because residues 815- <dig> also contribute to interactions with alg- <dig> to some extent  <cit> .

ef-hand proteins have similar helix-loop-helix structures, but conformational states with respect to angles and distances between the two helices and their changes in response to ca2+ binding are very diverse  <cit> . unlike calmodulin, alg- <dig> does not exhibit a significant change from the closed conformational state in the absence of ca2+ to the open conformational state in the presence ca2+  <cit> . nevertheless, binding of ca2+ or zn2+ to ef <dig> causes a small shift of α <dig> and leads to change in configuration of the r <dig> side chain  <cit> . substitution of f <dig> with ala disrupts the inter-helix interaction between α <dig> and α <dig> . comparison of the estimated angles formed by α <dig>  and α <dig>  in ef <dig> between the structures of wild-type alg- <dig>  and des3-20alg-2f122a  in the zn2+-bound forms  indicates inclination of α <dig> by  <dig> ° away from α <dig>  resulting in a shift in the position of the cα atom of f122a for  <dig>  Å . this more open conformation of the ef-hand motif in f122a mutant maintains distances or causes a small increase in distances between the cα atoms of y <dig> and t <dig>   and between the cα atoms of f122/a <dig> and q <dig>  . on the other hand, regardless of the disruption of inter-helix interaction, alg-2Δgf <dig> gave only a small increase in the angle  in the ca2+-bound form structure , and the distance between the cα atoms of y <dig> and t <dig> was significantly decreased in alg-2Δgf <dig> . consequently, the change in the relative spatial positions of α <dig> and the following loop may allow the side chains of a <dig>  y <dig> and adjacent r <dig> to place at more appropriate positions in the hydrophobic pockets of alg-2f122a to interact with the alix abs peptide. to corroborate the above hypothetical mechanism of enhanced binding of alg-2f122a to alix, we attempted co-crystallization of des3-20alg-2f122a with the alix abs peptide but could not obtain good crystals. the nature of n-terminal residues of alg- <dig> influences qualities of crystals. in the present study, we used des3-20alg-2f122a because x-ray diffraction resolutions were better in des3-20alg- <dig>  than in des3-23alg- <dig>  in the ca2+-bound forms in our previous study  <cit> . it would be worthwhile, however, to test des3-23alg-2f122a for crystal preparations of the complex.

alg- <dig> interacts with various proteins with pro-rich regions  <cit> . previously, we classified alg-2-interacting proteins into two groups  based on ability of binding to alg-2Δgf <dig>  <cit> . alix-type proteins such as tsg <dig>  annexin a <dig> and annexin a <dig> contain a consensus sequence of ppypx3-5yp  similar to the core motif of alix  <cit> . on the other hand, alg-2Δgf <dig> retains binding ability to non-alix-type proteins such as sec31a and phospholipid scramblase  <dig>  that possess a common sequence of pxpgf  but whose indispensability remains to be experimentally verified  <cit> . the mutation of f <dig> had different effects on capacities of binding to endogenous proteins among alix-type proteins, even to two paralogous annexin family proteins . although alg-2-binding sites still remain to be identified, annexin a <dig> and annexin a <dig> have 4-pgypptgypp- <dig> and 4-pgyppppggypp- <dig>  respectively. a clear difference between the two sequences is the number of residues present between two yps . since f <dig> constitutes pocket  <dig> and interacts with the aromatic side chain of the corresponding second yp in the alix abs peptide, mutation of f <dig> seems favored or disfavored for interaction depending on spatial positions of the concerned tyr residues in the target proteins. recently, mucolipin- <dig> has been shown to ca2+-dependently interact with alg- <dig> but not with alg-2Δgf <dig>  <cit> . the predicted binding site  does not contain any yp or pxpgf motif, but charged residues as well as hydrophobic residues were shown to be important for interactions. thus, mucolipin- <dig> may be recognized by a surface different from that for binding to pro-rich target proteins. ask <dig> and raf- <dig>  which are also known to interact with alg- <dig>  <cit> , do not possess conspicuous pro-rich regions either, and the alg-2-binding site has not been reported yet. it would be interesting to see whether f122a and other amino acid-substituted mutants of pocket  <dig> and pocket  <dig> present a different binding profile between pro-rich type and non-pro-rich type alg-2-interacting proteins.

the biological significance of the occurrence of alg-2Δgf <dig> is not known. alg- <dig> forms a dimer and each molecule of the dimer has capacity of alix binding  <cit> . recently, we demonstrated that alg- <dig>  functions as a ca2+-dependent adaptor protein that bridges alix and tsg <dig>  whereas alg-2Δgf <dig>  retaining dimerization ability, does not have such a function toward alix and tsg <dig>  <cit> . occurrence of alg-2Δgf <dig> in the cell should give chances to form dimers in different combinations at different ratios according to the expressed levels of wild-type alg- <dig> and alg-2Δgf <dig> . although alg- <dig> dimers of wt/Δgf <dig> and Δgf122/Δgf <dig> are inactive adaptors at least for the alix-type alg-2-interacting proteins, the wt/Δgf <dig> dimer may still function for non-alix-type proteins. although the molecular mechanism of the alg- <dig> function in staurosporine-induced cell death is not known yet, slight augmentation of staurosporine-induced cell death by alg-2Δgf <dig>  suggests that non-alix type alg-2-interacting proteins are also involved. recent clinical investigations suggest that alg- <dig> is a potential prognostic marker of certain lung and gastric cancers  <cit> . expression analyses of alg- <dig> by further distinguishing alternatively spliced isoforms would provide more reliable data in clinical studies. rbm <dig>  a highly conserved rna-binding protein functioning as an auxiliary factor of the spliceosome, was shown to interact with alg- <dig>  <cit> . it would be interesting to see whether alg- <dig> regulates its own splicing as well as ca2+-dependent alternative splicing events  <cit> . future studies are needed to clarify whether alg-2Δgf <dig> plays roles merely as a negative inhibitor of wild-type alg- <dig> or positively functions by associating with alg-2Δgf122-specific interacting proteins.

CONCLUSIONS
structural basis of the inability of the splicing isoform of human alg- <dig>  alg-2Δgf <dig>  to bind to alix was investigated by x-ray crystal structural analysis. missing of two residues, gly121phe <dig>  causes shortening of an α-helix  and leads to a change in the configuration of the r <dig> side chain that resembles that of the metal-free form of alg- <dig>  contrary to the expected importance of bulky side chain of f <dig>  the f122a mutant exhibited a surprising hyperactivity in binding to alix. the resolved structure of the f122a mutant showed that removal of the bulky f <dig> side chain not only created an additional open space in pocket  <dig> but also abolished inter-helix interactions with w <dig> and v <dig>  and that α <dig> inclined away from α <dig> to expand pocket  <dig>  suggesting acquirement of more appropriate positioning of the interacting residues to accept alix. however, no hyperactivity against tsg <dig> or annexin a <dig> suggests that f <dig> partly restricts the recognition specificity to target proteins.
