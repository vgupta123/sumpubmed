BACKGROUND
growth arrest specific- <dig> gene  was found in a screen to identify genes specifically expressed in growth-arrested mouse cells  <cit> . the full-length cdna of human gas <dig> was cloned  <cit>  and the mature protein was found to contain  <dig> amino acids, a potential signal peptide, one n-glycosylation site at asn <dig> and an aminated ser <dig>  <cit> . the aminated ser <dig> allows the mature protein to be glycophosphatidylinositol  anchored to the cell membrane  <cit> .

gas <dig> was found to arrest cell cycle by stopping the cells in synthesis  phase  <cit>  and due to its ability to arrest cell proliferation in p53-dependent manner it has been considered to be a tumour suppressor protein  <cit> . generally gas <dig> might act as a tumour suppressor in adult brain, though the expression in brain leading to apoptosis has not been observed in adults  <cit> . sequence comparison of human and murine gas <dig> genes suggested that it has a conserved rgd-peptide sequence for possible rgd-dependent integrin binding at residues 306– <dig>  <cit> .

additionally gas <dig> has been shown to have a significant role in development  <cit> . at early developmental stages gas <dig> is expressed in most embryonic tissues. during development gas <dig> has been reported to inhibit cell proliferation and to mediate cell death, to be involved in embryonic patterning, and to support growth of the cerebellum  <cit> .

gas <dig> is clearly a multifunctional protein, since it signals through at least two different kinds of transmembrane receptor proteins, rearranged during transformation   <cit>  and the hedgehog receptor protein patched- <dig>  <cit> . the hedgehog signalling pathway is important in development, stem cell renewal, and cancer progression. gas <dig> is able to bind sonic hedgehog  and activate the signalling pathway from patched- <dig>  <cit> . ret, on the other hand, is a transmembrane kinase, first identified as a proto-oncogene  <cit> . overactivity of ret can cause several types of cancers, and loss-of-function mutations cause varying degrees of loss in the enteric nervous system resulting in hirschprung’s disease . normally ret mediated signalling is controlled by glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor family ligands  and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor receptor alphas , which form a four-member protein family   <cit> .

of these, gas <dig> has highest  similarity to gfrα <dig>  while gas <dig> and gfrα <dig> both have only two domains unlike gfrα1- <dig>  which consists of three domains  <cit> . the secondary structure of mammalian gas <dig> is predicted to be mostly α-helical separated by short β-strands and to have a long unstructured c-terminal domain  <cit> . by binding gfls, gfrαs take part in controlling the survival of neurons, neuron branching, and functional recovery  <cit> . the most studied member of gfls is gdnf, which was identified due to its function as a survival factor for midbrain dopaminergic neurons  <cit> . gdnf forms a complex with gfrα <dig> and promotes the survival of neurons  <cit> . gfls, in general, are dimeric proteins and they are capable of binding two gfrα receptors per ligand  <cit> . after the formation of gfrα-gfl complex, the complex then binds to the transmembrane tyrosine kinase ret  <cit> .

despite the structural similarity to gfrαs, gas <dig> differs from them functionally because it is able to bind to ret in a ligand independent way  <cit> . in addition, the intracellular signalling pathway is most probably different than for gfrα-gdnf complex, and gas <dig> bound to ret blocks akt activation, and increases erk activation  <cit> .

gas <dig> has been suspected to be an ancestor of gfrα proteins  <cit> . thus the four gfls and gfrαs could have been generated by genome duplications at the origin of vertebrates, and at this point the gene encoding gas <dig> could have diverged from gfrα-like proteins  <cit> .

it has been hypothesised that the relative abundance and localization of gfrαs, gfls and gas <dig> could determine in certain conditions whether cells survive or die  <cit> . furthermore, gas <dig> expression is increased in neuronal cell death during early development  <cit> . therefore, gas <dig> could work as a switch between proliferation and differentiation in neuronal development  <cit> . gas <dig> has been shown to colocalize to lipid rafts with ret  <cit> . this has led to the hypothesis that gas <dig> could be a negative modulator of gdnf signalling and able to control gdnf stimulation via ret  <cit> .

RESULTS
production and purification of human gas <dig> protein
after cloning and expressing human gas <dig> in tricoplusia ni cells, we purified secreted gas <dig> from the insect cell growth medium using ni-affinity chromatography , and the identity and size of the expressed protein was verified with a western blot . the purified protein is glycosylated and therefore does not run exactly according to excepted molecular weight on the sds-page, but slightly higher. thrombin was used to cleave off the tags, and the size of the protein after cleavage was verified by sds-page and maldi-tof mass spectroscopy. the yield of purified protein was on average ca. 1 mg/l.figure  <dig>

based on the primary sequence one n-glycosylation site was predicted at asn <dig> located in the n-terminal domain. the corresponding site in the gfrα-structures is located at the domain interface between the two homologous disulphide rich domains, in a tightly packed two-domain structure  <cit> , suggesting that the gas <dig> overall conformation is quite likely very different .figure  <dig>

when the protein was treated with pngase f to remove glycans, the size of the protein diminished slightly on sds-page , and based on maldi-tof analysis, we observe a decrease in molecular weight of ca. 900 da; the glycosylated protein had a molecular mass of  <dig>  kda and the de-glycosylated protein of  <dig>  kda, according to maldi-tof, while the theoretical molecular mass of the protein without glycosylation is  <dig>  kd, thus matching well with the mass spectrometry results. the result obtained for glycosylated protein corresponds to approximately one n-glycan added post-translationally in the insect cells. the purified protein was functional in binding to ret in vitro, and found to be over 90% pure on sds-page, and monodisperse in solution after gel filtration.

gas <dig> is a monomer is solution and highly thermostable
the cleaved, non-tagged protein was found to be a monomer by analytical size exclusion chromatography and multi-angle light scattering  . at 1 mg/ml and  <dig>  mg/ml the sec-malls runs gave a single peak with molecular mass of ca. 31–33 kda , matching quite well to the theoretical size of monomeric gas <dig>  considering the additional glycosylation at one site. similarly, based on the small-angle x-ray scattering  data, the molecular weight matches most closely to a monomer . in our opinion, this is likely to reflect the oligomerization state of the lipid-anchored protein, which is unlikely to be affected by the anchor. no detectable oligomerization was observed in native page or gel filtration at  <dig>  mg/ml, while in saxs data an effect from residual aggregation was evident at higher concentrations.figure  <dig>

the guinier i-value was calculated against an absolute reference   <cit>  and the i for the sample is then equal to the molecular weight. molecular weight from the porod volume is estimated according to petoukhov et al.  <cit> .



circular dichroism  spectroscopy was used to verify the secondary structure content of gas <dig> and, as expected, the cd spectrum was typical for an α-helical protein . a measured temperature denaturation curve with cd gave a result with partial melting of the structure when heated to 90°c . however, full temperature denaturation was not possible to obtain by cd, nor by differential scanning calorimetry , possibly due to the high disulphide content of the protein. this suggests that the domain structure is thermally very stable. the decrease in cd signal at 222 nm did not even reach the midpoint of denaturation when heated to 90°c .

sequence analysis and evolution of gas1
the gas <dig> protein domain structure is defined by two gfrα–like domains, with  <dig> conserved disulphide bridge-forming cysteines in each domain  <cit> . gas <dig> is present in all the vertebrates, and homologs are also found in lower chordates . in addition, gas <dig> homologs also occur in c. elegans and honeybee, but not, surprisingly, in drosophila. the sequence identity to vertebrate proteins, however, is quite low: ca. 21-24% for honeybee and only 14-19% for the worm sequence . two conserved cysteines are missing from the c. elegans sequence , and thus the protein fold might not be fully conserved in the c. elegans homolog   <cit> . alignment of the gas <dig> sequences shows that, in higher vertebrates, the n-terminal domain has an insertion with low sequence complexity , apparently forming an extended loop structure . mammals have also an rgd sequence in the c-terminal linker region. also, a single n-glycosylation site at asn <dig> is predicted to be conserved based on sequence in all vertebrates, while it is not present in the invertebrates. in the set of conserved residues beyond the structural cysteines   a subset are present only in the vertebrate proteins, and, other than the conserved cysteines, only ten residues are conserved also in c. elegans.table  <dig>

when the conserved amino acid residues are displayed onto the surface of the modelled domains, the most conserved surface patch is found on the n-terminal domain surface formed by residues on helices 3– <dig>  whereas the c-terminal domain surface did not reveal large patches of conservation . here conservation is defined by >75% sequence similarity amongst the residue groups khr, ed, nqstgp, ilmvca and fyw.

homology modelling of gas <dig> domains and comparison to gfrαs
we constructed homology models of both gas <dig> domains with the raptorx-server   <cit> , designed for low sequence homology-based modelling. the models for both domains fit well to the gfrα-structure   <cit> . as described above, the n-terminal domain of mammalian gas1-proteins contain a large inserted loop with low sequence complexity, which based on modelling indeed appears to form a large flexible loop, but whether this region has functional significance or not remains unclear.

modelling of gas <dig> has partially been done before also by cabrera et al.  <cit>  and schueler-furman et al.  <cit> . here our aim was to study possible conservation of the ligand binding regions of gfrαs vs. gas <dig>  to do more detailed analysis on the structure, and to provide models for the analysis of saxs data .

although the sequence identity to the related gfrα structures is low, the cysteines involved in disulphide bridges are well conserved for the two gfrα-type domains and make structure prediction possible. the n-terminal domain of gas <dig> is equivalent of the second domain in gfrαs, which contains the growth factor binding site. we aligned our model of gas <dig> with the gfrα1:gdnf complex structure  <cit> , and, based on the structural alignment, the binding region for the gdnf is not conserved in gas <dig> . similarly the conserved binding residues in gfrα2:artemin complex   <cit> , are not present in gas <dig>  in fact, the key ionic residues required for ligand binding are conserved in both these structure, but not present in gas <dig>  the conserved key residues for gdnf binding in gfrα <dig> are arg <dig>  arg <dig> and asn <dig>  in our structural analysis gas <dig> has tyr <dig>  thr <dig>  gln <dig> in equivalent side chain positions; in gas <dig>  the ion triplet required for growth factor binding  <cit>  is absent.

it has also been suggested by wang et al.  <cit>  and parkash et al.  <cit>  that a ret binding region would be located mostly in the second  domain on the gfrαs and would involve the gfrα <dig> residues arg <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig>  gln <dig>  lys <dig>  arg <dig>  arg <dig>  glu <dig>  and asp <dig>  this site forms a highly positively charged patch on the surface of gfrα <dig>  identified also as a heparin binding site by parkash et al.  <cit> . we analysed the equivalent region in the n-terminal domain of gas <dig>  but found no conservation between the gfrα <dig> structure and gas <dig> . overall gas <dig> is not positively charged, as would be expected of a typical heparin-binding molecule. the calculated pi-value for human gas <dig> is  <dig>  whereas for human gfrαs the values range from  <dig> - <dig>   to  <dig>   and  <dig>  . also, gas <dig> does not contain a highly positively charged patch in the suggested ret/heparin binding region, and heparin affinity chromatography of gas <dig> showed no significant binding to the column , whereas the well-known heparin binding protein hbgam eluted only at 1 m nacl . finally, modelling of gas <dig> n- terminal domain shows that glycosylated asn <dig> will be situated at the position equivalent to the domain interface between domains d <dig> and d <dig> in the gfrα structures .figure  <dig>

structural characterization of gas- <dig> by solution x-ray scattering
solution x-ray scattering  data indicated that gas <dig> is monomeric at  <dig>  mg/ml in solution based on the porod volume and guinier plots : at higher concentrations the protein starts to aggregate, and the data beyond 1 mg/ml could not be analysed. rigid body modelling of the structure was done based on homology models of the individual domains, and elongated models gave the best fits . we also calculated ab initio envelopes, which matched well with rigid body modelling of the structure . both differ significantly from the compact gdnf co-receptor structures  <cit> . however, as it is clear that the structure is likely to be flexible, in particular the c-terminal long unstructured region, we also did ensemble fitting of the model against the data. this resulted in a bimodal ensemble represented by four major structures selected from the initial random pool of  <dig>  <dig> structures, which fit to the data with χ2 =  <dig>  . the selected structures represent states with extended and collapsed c-terminal linkers and variable orientations of the domains relative to each other . taken together it appears from the saxs data that the orientation of the domains of gas <dig> relative to each other is not fixed; clearly the protein exists in two populations of extended and collapsed conformations.figure  <dig>

binding and affinity of gas <dig> to ret in vitro
we tested whether gas <dig> is able to directly interact with ret in a ligand independent way, as previously reported  <cit> . for this purpose, and to determine the affinity of the interaction, the ret receptor was coupled to a chip for surface plasmon resonance assay, and binding of a concentration series of gas <dig> to immobilized ret was measured. a kd-value of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm was measured for the interaction in vitro . the kinetics of the interaction were too fast to allow for measurement of on- and off-rates, as is evident from the time scale of the binding and dissociation from the sensograms .figure  <dig>

discussion
we have overexpressed and purified the human gas <dig> protein in soluble form without the gpi-anchor, and biophysically characterized the protein. we constructed homology models for both domains of gas <dig> and were able to analyse the domain structure of the protein in comparison to the structurally related gfrαs. as reported earlier by others  <cit> , gas <dig> has clearly two gfrα-like domains, but we have shown here that gas <dig> differs significantly from gfrαs in both sequence and in structure.

the differences can be characterized as follows: firstly, gas <dig> has a large, 10– <dig> amino acid unstructured, low complexity ala/gly/pro-containing loop in the n-terminal domain. this loop region is present in higher vertebrates, in mammalians and chicken, but not in fish . whether this loop might have some function remains unknown. secondly, the two-domain structure of gas <dig> appears to be more flexible overall than in the characterized gfrα structures. in the gfrαs, the functional domains d <dig> and d <dig> form a compact structure, whereas gas <dig> saxs analysis reveals a flexible ensemble of structures, with the n- and c-terminal domains as independent structural units. this might reflect the location of the functional binding regions of the molecule versus those of the gfrαs. as expected, the protein is α-helical based on the cd spectrum. it is somewhat intriguing that we were not able to fully denature the protein; apparently the disulphide-linked arrangement of the domains is highly thermostable, and this might be a general feature of the gfrα-family.

the structural flexibility is probably a conserved feature in the protein family, as the single n-glycosylation site in the human protein is conserved in chordates. this n-glycan blocks the gfrα-equivalent domain interface, and hence the formation of that type of compact structure. it has been also observed that this glycosylation site might have functional significance for shh binding  <cit> .

our sequence analysis and that by hätinen et al.  <cit>  suggest that gas <dig> is conserved during evolution, with homologs in chordates , arthropods and roundworms, thus possibly representing an ancestral gfrα-like protein  <cit>  however, the sequence identity from chordate to invertebrates  genes is low, 14-19% for the worm phas- <dig> homolog of gas <dig>  <cit> , and it remains an open question whether the insect or worm genes identified as gas <dig> actually share any of the functions of vertebrate gas1/gfrα type of receptors, either in ret or the hedgehog signalling.

gas <dig>  as well as gfrα-like proteins, are conserved beyond vertebrates, while gfls are not expressed in non-vertebrates. this suggests that either ret binding, independent of gfls is conserved, or that there are alternative receptors for gas <dig>  in case of gas <dig>  this could be shh and patched- <dig>  interestingly in drosophila, the grfα-like protein does not interact with ret but does interact with drosophila ncam analog, fasii  <cit> . the mammalian gfls are known to be ligands of ncam  <cit> : whether gas <dig> might interact with ncam homologs remains to be investigated.

when we compared our model with the gfrα <dig> structure it was clear that the crucial amino acids for gfl binding are not conserved in gas <dig>  and it most likely lacks the ability to bind gfl-like ligands, as they all share the same binding mode  <cit> . indeed cabrera et al.  <cit>  reported that gas <dig> is not able to bind gdnf. while gas <dig> lacks the ability to bind gfl-type of ligands, our in vitro binding data support the findings by cabrera et al.  <cit>  that gas <dig> can bind ret in a ligand independent manner, and possibly alter the intracellular signalling of ret.

the affinity of gas <dig> for ret is significantly lower than that of the gfrα-gdnf ligand complex in solution . however on the cell surface the affinity of gas <dig> to ret is also likely to be higher as the diffusion is restricted to two-dimensions.

another possibility is that in some cellular contexts gas <dig> would be highly expressed on cell surface, which might boost the binding to ret locally. the exact mechanism of gas <dig> on ret signalling remains elusive, but it seems clear that gas <dig> has an effect of ret signalling, probably by inhibiting growth-factor dependent signalling  <cit> .

based on the conservation of protein surface features, as mapped on to the gas <dig> models, we suggest that the n-terminal domain region defined by α − helices 3– <dig> might contain a functional binding site , whereas other possible interaction surfaces remain less clear, e.g. the very short rgd-peptide motif found in mammalian sequences could be functional, or exist by chance, and so far no biochemical evidence for the function exists.

gas <dig> has also been reported to alter shh-signalling through patched- <dig>  <cit> , indicating that gas <dig> has multiple functions. related to this pineda-alvarez et al.  <cit>  and ribeiro et al.  <cit>  reported missense mutations of gas <dig> in holoprosencephaly  patients.in particular thr200arg mutation in the second domain of gas <dig> pineda-alvarez et al.  <cit>  was observed to result in almost complete loss of binding affinity for shh, hence this domain could also be important for binding to shh. also asn220lys caused 20% reduction in binding according to pineda-alvarez et al.  <cit>  and ala246ser patient mutations are located in the same domain, while the mutations are some what scattered around the domain and do not cluster together on the surface.

CONCLUSIONS
our structural data reveal that gas <dig> is a flexible two-domain molecule, the flexibility perhaps reflecting its multifunctional properties. the structural arrangement of the domains is clearly different form the compact gfrα structures, suggesting that it has different functional roles. in particular, neither the putative heparan sulphate proteoglycan/ret binding site  <cit>  the known growth factor binding site are conserved in gas <dig> 

thus, gas <dig> must act on ret in a different way, and together with previous analysis our binding data supports the ligand-independent ret binding by gas <dig>  while sequence conservation analysis hints at possible sites of functional importance.
