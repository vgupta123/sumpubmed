BACKGROUND
identification and characterization of diverse classes of small non-coding rnas  in eukaryotes has been a major research focus in recent years  <cit> . at least four classes of srnas have been well characterized in plants, including heterochromatic and repeat-associated small interfering rnas   <cit> , micrornas   <cit> , trans-acting sirnas   <cit>  and natural antisense transcript-derived sirnas   <cit> . in plants, the majority of endogenous srnas are 24-nt rasirnas  <cit> . they repress transposable elements and maintain genome integrity though guiding dna methylation and histone modification  <cit> . to date, the dcl3-dependent rasirna biogenesis pathway has been reported in angiosperms and mosses  <cit> , but considered absent from conifers  <cit> . mirnas are produced from primary mirnas  and precursor mirnas  by dicer like  <dig>  cleavage  <cit> . mature mirnas guide the rna-induced silencing complexes  to degrade target mrna transcripts  <cit>  or inhibit their translation  <cit> . mirnas play key roles in plant development, growth, nutrient homeostasis and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . in arabidopsis, tasirna biogenesis initiates from mirna-mediated cleavage of a non-coding primary transcript originated from the tas locus  <cit> . rna-dependent rna polymerase  <dig>  synthesizes long double-stranded rna  molecules, which are sliced by dcl <dig> into phased 21-nt tasirnas  <cit> . in arabidopsis, the mir390-tas3-auxin response factor  pathway executes important functions in leaf development and lateral root formation  <cit> . finally, nat-sirnas are produced through natural antisense transcription and are fashioned by dcl <dig> or dcl <dig>  <cit> . the functional roles for eukaryotic nat-sirnas that has been described to date are in environmental stress responses and developmental processes  <cit> .

identification of conserved and species-specific mirnas usually relies on two approaches: computational prediction and experimental sequencing. by searching genomic and/or est databases for orthologous sequences of known mirnas and analyzing their pre-mirna hairpin structures, many conserved mirnas are identified from a variety of plants, such as arabidopsis thaliana <cit>  and brassica napus <cit> . high throughput sequencing technologies, such as massively parallel signature sequencing ,  <dig> and sequencing-by-synthesis , have greatly facilitated the discovery of low abundant and recently evolved mirnas in diverse plants, e.g., triticum aestivum <cit> , oryza sativa <cit> , and solanum lycopersicum <cit> .

there have been reports of investigation and characterization of mirnas in gymnosperms. lu et al. identified  <dig> mirnas from stem xylem of pinus taeda, of which  <dig> mirnas were likely associated with the fusiform rust gall disease  <cit> . by sequencing of small rna libraries generated from a taxus chinensis cell line, qiu et al. found that the expression levels of  <dig> mirnas have been significantly altered after treatment with methyl jasmonate  <cit> . recently, a total of  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirna families were revealed in pinus contorta <cit> . study on mirnas in picea abies indicated that  <dig> conserved and  <dig> novel mirnas participated in the temperature-dependent epigenetic memory and climatic adaptation  <cit> . these reports showed that like in angiosperms, mirna-guided post transcriptional gene regulation mechanism is important for the development, growth, stress responses and a myriad of other physiological processes in gymnosperms.

chinese fir  is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in terms of both industrial and commercial wood supplies in china  <cit> . however, to date only  <dig> chinese fir est sequences are available in the public databases. no study on chinese fir srnas has been reported so far. to gain mrna transcriptome sequences of chinese fir, we recently conducted a high-throughput sequencing of mrnas isolated from a mixture of tissues. in this study, we used the sequencing-by-synthesis  technology to sequence a chinese fir srna library and obtained a comprehensive set of srnas. furthermore, we studied expression patterns of conserved and novel mirnas by qrt-pcr. potential targets were predicted for most mirnas, of which  <dig> target genes have been experimentally verified. intriguingly, the dcl3-dependent rasirna biogenesis pathway which had been thought to be absent in conifers was found in chinese fir. these results suggest that regulative mirnas exist in the economically important conifer, chinese fir, and shed new light on the srna evolution from mosses to flowering plants.

RESULTS
chinese fir has a complex small rna population
to identify srnas involved in chinese fir development and growth, we used illumina high throughput sequencing technology to sequence a srna library generated from total rnas of seeds, seedlings, leaves, stems and calli. in total,  <dig> , <dig> raw srna sequence reads were acquired and further processed with the bgi srna analysis pipeline. after removal of low-quality sequences, adapter sequences, polya sequences, sequences smaller than  <dig> nt and other artifacts, we obtained  <dig> , <dig>  unique srnas with lengths of  <dig> to  <dig> nt .

* the ratio is equal to the separate reads divided by the total raw reads.

we then mapped the  <dig> , <dig> unique srna sequences to chinese fir mrna transcriptome sequences and arabidopsis thaliana and populus trichocarpa genome sequences, utilizing the computational software soap , owing to the lack of c. lanceolata genomic sequences. the chinese fir mrna transcriptome database contains  <dig>  contig sequences,  <dig>  scaffold sequences and  <dig>  unigene sequences. the unigene sequences have an average length of 497â€‰bp. the numbers of unique srnas perfectly matched the chinese fir mrna transcriptome sequences, the a. thaliana genome and the p. trichocarpa genome were  <dig>  ,  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively . a total of  <dig> unique srnas were identified to be the common srnas matching perfectly to the chinese fir mrna transcriptome, a. thaliana genome and p. trichocarpa genome . these perfectly aligned srnas are of particular interest as they represent highly conserved srnas in the three distantly related organisms. after further removal of rrnas , trnas , snrnas , snornas  and repeat regions , a total of  <dig> , <dig> srnas were obtained.

*srna categories, repeat, exon-sense, exon-antisense, intron-sense and intron-antisense, contain srnas perfectly matching the repeat sequences in the genbank databases and rfam database, the sense strand of a protein coding gene exon, the antisense strand of a protein coding gene exon, the sense strand of a protein coding gene intron and the antisense strand of a protein coding gene intron, respectively.

although some srnas were abundant and presented hundreds of thousands times in our database, the majority of srnas were sequenced only a few times. for example,  <dig> , <dig>  srnas were sequenced only once, which suggests that chinese fir contains a large and complex srna population. the srna singleton rate of chinese fir  was similar to that of a. thalianao. sativa, and p. trichocarpa, which is 65%  <cit> , 82%  <cit> , and 73%  <cit> , respectively.

the length distribution of unique srnas  was summarized in figure 1a. it was worthy to note that the length of the chinese fir srnas was not evenly distributed. conspicuously,  <dig>  and  <dig>  nt srnas were the two major size classes, which are the typical length of plant rasirnas and mirnas, respectively. meanwhile, the ratio of unique reads to total reads for 24- and 21-nt srnas was  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively, which means that the 24-nt srnas have a higher complexity than the 21-nt srnas. the srna population yielded a median length of  <dig> nt and a low variance . we also compared the length distributions of srnas from  <dig> plant species, including a. thaliana, rice, p. trichocarpa, p. contorta and chinese fir . it showed that approximately 80% of the srnas ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt and the most abundant class of srnas was 21- or 24-nt srnas in these five species.

discovery of conserved mirnas
to identify conserved mirnas in chinese fir, we conducted a local blastn search using unique srnas  against known plant mirnas in the mirbase , which contains  <dig> mirnas from  <dig> plant species . a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas were identified in chinese fir, belonging to  <dig> mirna families . ninety-one  conserved mirnas start with a 5' terminal uridine residue, a conserved feature of mirnas recognized by the ago <dig> protein  <cit> . in addition,  <dig> unique srnas  perfectly matched a. thaliana mirna precursors and  <dig> srnas were identical to a. thaliana mature mirnas , whereas  <dig> srnas  mapped to p. trichocarpa mirna precursors and  <dig> srnas exactly matched p. trichocarpa mature mirnas  . these figures suggest that approximately half of mature mirnas are conserved between c. lanceolata and the two model angiosperms.

the high throughput sequencing technology provides an alternative way to assess expression profiles of diverse mirna genes and the number of reads can serve as an index for the relative abundance of diverse mirnas  <cit> . intriguingly, chinese fir mirna abundance varied drastically. for example, cln-mir157a, cln-mir156a and cln-mir167a had  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  redundancies, respectively, while many mirnas  were sequenced only once. similarly, the number of members within a mirna family differed tremendously. for example, cln-mir <dig> and cln-mir <dig> families contained  <dig> and  <dig> members respectively, whereas many mirna families  possessed only one member. the detailed family member numbers were summarized in figure  <dig>  a total of  <dig> conserved mirna families contained more than one member.

in the present study, we have tried to find the precursor sequences for the conserved chinese fir mirnas. precursor sequences of  <dig> mirnas, including cln-mir162d, cln-mir164b, cln-mir166o and cln-mir <dig>  have been identified from the chinese fir mrna transcriptome database . their hairpin structures predicted by mfold were shown in additional file  <dig>  the length of chinese fir mirna precursors ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, with a majority of which  ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt. this result is similar with that found in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> . the minimal folding free energy indices  of chinese fir mirna precursors varied from  <dig>  to  <dig> , with an average of  <dig> , in agreement with that of other plant mirnas, such as arabidopsis, rice, glycine maxmedicago truncatulasaccharum officinarumsorghum bicolor and zea mays <cit> . with complete genome sequences and larger est databases, more precursor sequences will be found in chinese fir. in addition, we identified the mirna* sequences of cln-mir162d, cln-mir164b and cln-mir <dig> in at least one of the three small rna libraries constructed from total rnas of chinese fir cambium, providing further evidence that the three mirnas are canonical mirnas.

we also performed rt-pcr analyses to confirm the expressions of  <dig> conserved mature mirnas  and cln-tasir <dig> . the results showed that these conserved mirnas and cln-tasir <dig> could be detected in one or more of the four chinese fir samples, including seeds, seedlings, leaves and stems. further subcloning and sequencing of the pcr products confirmed that the mature sequences of  <dig> mirnas  and the precursor sequence of cln-mir164b were identical to the sequences obtained from illumina sequencing.

after blastp searches and further sequence analyses, a variety of unigene sequences in the chinese fir mrna transcriptome database were identified homologous to known proteins associated with mirna biogenesis and action . for example,  <dig> and  <dig> unigene sequences were found highly homologous to arabidopsis dcl <dig> and ago <dig> protein genes, respectively. together with the finding of plenty of mature mirnas and their precursors, these data provide clear evidence that the conserved pathway for mirna generation and action exists in chinese fir.

identification of novel mirnas
the primary criterion for plant mirna designation is the precise excision of an ~21-nucleotide mirna/mirna* duplex from the stem of a single stranded, stem-loop precursor  <cit> . using the algorithm mireap, we found one putative novel mirna, designated as cln-mirn <dig>  in chinese fir. the mature and precursor sequences of cln-mirn <dig> were further validated by subcloning . the precursor sequence of cln-mirn <dig> can form canonical hairpin structure as predicted by mfold and has an mfei value of  <dig> , which is similar to that of other plant mirnas . the mature sequence of cln-mirn <dig> also begins with a 5' terminal uridine residue. the illumina sequencing redundancy of cln-mirn <dig> is  <dig>  which is much lower than that of many conserved mirnas. the low redundancy of cln-mirn <dig> indicates that it may play important roles under certain conditions or in particular developmental stages in chinese fir. although the mir* sequence of cln-mirn <dig> was not identified in the srna database of the present study, we found it was in a small rna library generated from total rna of chinese fir cambium. using blastn, we did not find homologous sequence of unigene <dig>  the primary sequence of cln-mirn <dig>  in the public databases. these results indicate that cln-mirn <dig> may be a novel and chinese fir-specific mirna.

expression profiles of conserved and novel mirnas
to provide clues about the physiological functions of srnas in chinese fir development and growth, we utilized semi-quantitative rt-pcr and real time rt-pcr to examine the expression profiles of  <dig> conserved mirnas , the novel mirna, cln-mirn <dig> and cln-tasir <dig> in samples of diverse developmental stages, including seeds, seedlings, leaves and stems. these srnas were selected for their key roles in plant development and growth  <cit> .

the signal intensity on agarose gels demonstrated that cln-mir156a and cln-mir157a seemed to be strongly expressed in seeds but was barely detected in leaves and stems . consistent with this result, the expression level of cln-mir157a was more than 250-fold higher in seeds than in leaves . conversely, cln-mir164a and cln-mirn <dig> were expressed abundantly in leaves and stems, moderately in seedlings and weakly in seeds. the expression levels of mirn <dig> were about 10-fold higher in leaves and stems than in seeds and twice higher than in seedlings. cln-mir166a had moderate expressions in seedlings, leaves and stems and week expression in seeds. cln-mir408a and cln-mir165a showed strong and ubiquitous expressions in the samples examined. these results indicate that the expressions of  <dig> conserved mirnas, cln-mirn <dig> and cln-tasir <dig>  as demonstrated by illumina sequencing, were validated by rt-pcr or qrt-pcr. some of them were expressed ubiquitously in all samples, while others displayed tissue and/or growth stage specific expression patterns.

prediction of mirna targets
to better understand the functions of conserved and novel mirnas, we predicted their putative targets by employing the web-based psrnatarget program  <cit> . a total of  <dig> chinese fir unigene sequences were predicted to be putative targets of  <dig> conserved mirna families and one novel mirna family . among them,  <dig>  mirna targets are homologous to the previously confirmed or predicted targets in a. thalianao. sativap. trichocarpap. taeda, and/or t. chinensis. four mirna families  have more than one conserved target, while  <dig> mirna families  have only one conserved target. these conserved targets include not only essential transcription factors, but also structural and metabolism-related proteins. for example, squamosa promoter-binding proteins , important transcription factors known to control developmental timing, were predicted to be targets of cln-mir156; the apetala2-like protein, an important transcription factor known to regulate flower development, was predicted to be a target of cln-mir <dig> and non-transcriptional factor protein ago <dig>  an indispensable component for mirna action, was predicted as a target of cln-mir <dig> 

a all predicted mirna targets with penalty scores  of  <dig> or less are listed.

bath, osa, ptc, pta and tch represent abbreviations for a. thaliana, o. sativa, p. trichocarpa, p. taeda and t. chinensis, respectively.

a total of  <dig> putative targets were not conserved in other plant species. among them,  <dig>  targets currently have no functional annotation. we were unable to predict targets for  <dig> conserved mirna families. it may be attributable to insufficient chinese fir mrna sequences. four unigene sequences were predicted to be targets of the novel mirna, cln-mirn <dig>  one of the  <dig> targets is similar to glycosyltransferase from lycium barbarum, one is homologous to cl-channel clc- <dig> from p. trichocarpa, whereas the other two have no functional annotation. this implies that cln-mirn <dig> may be involved in multiple physiological and metabolic processes in chinese fir. more studies need to be performed to elucidate the functions of cln-mirn <dig> in the growth and development in chinese fir.

validation of mirna-guided cleavage of mrnas
plant mature mirnas can guide risc complexes to cleave target mrnas through nucleotide complementarity. the cleavage site usually corresponds to the tenth nucleotide from the 5' end of the mirna  <cit> . to verify that mirnas can regulate their target mrna expression in chinese fir, we performed a modified rna ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cdna ends  experiment, using total rna extracted from 2-month-old seedling stems .

in the present experiment,  <dig> unigene sequences were verified to be the targets of  <dig> chinese fir mirnas. sequencing of the 5' race cleaved product of unigene <dig> identified a precise slice at the cln-mir157a binding site, between position  <dig> and  <dig> . unigene <dig> encodes a protein homologous to the arabidopsis transcription factor squamosa promoter-binding protein-like  <dig> . unigene <dig> encoding ago <dig> protein had a main cleavage site at the 11th nucleotide of cln-mir168a from the 5'-end. unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> were validated to be targets of cln-mir <dig> and cln-mir <dig>  respectively, with multiple cleavage sites. unigene <dig> codes for a protein highly homologous to bola-like family protein, while unigene <dig> has no annotation in the public databases. unigene <dig>  the putative target of cln-mir164c, was also evaluated for its cleavage site. it was sliced  <dig> nucleotides downstream the canonical cleavage site, which could be attributed to secondary sirna in the 21-nucleotide register with the cleavage site for mirnas, as reported by ronemus and de paola  <cit> . unigene <dig> codes for a protein highly homologous to pentatricopeptide  repeat-containing protein.

identification of dcl enzymes and phylogenetic analysis
because dcl enzymes are crucial determinants of small rna size, we proceeded to identify candidate dcl proteins in chinese fir. figure 6a shows the linear organization of an angiosperm dicer protein that contains dexd-helicase, helicase-c, duf <dig>  paz, rnase iii and double-stranded rna-binding  domains. however, dcl <dig> lacks a second dsrbd and dcl <dig> lacks duf <dig>  given that chinese fir genome has not been sequenced, we searched chinese fir mrna transcriptome database for putative dcls using  <dig> known dicer nucleotide sequences from a. thaliana. after blastp searches and further sequence analysis,  <dig> unigene sequences were identified orthologous to arabidopsis dcl proteins with high-quality alignments . the predicted amino acid sequences of  <dig> unigenes were found containing diverse dcl domains. five of the  <dig> known dicer domains were identified , whereas the duf <dig> domain was not found. multiple sequence alignments were made with predicted dcl sequences and the corresponding regions from each of the  <dig> a. thaliana,  <dig> o. sativa and  <dig> p. patens dcls. figure 6b shows the most conserved regions  of unigene <dig> and the three model plant dcls. ten residues were absolutely conserved in this region and  <dig> residues were highly conserved . the alignments were used to generate the most likely phylogenetic tree of dicers . three unigene sequences  aligned very well with angiosperm and fern dcl <dig>  dcl <dig> and dcl <dig>  respectively. together with the identification of highly conserved rasirnas, mirnas and tasirnas in chinese fir, these results provide compelling evidence for the conservation of srna-generating pathways between gymnosperms and angiosperms.

dcl3-dependent rasirna generation pathway exists in chinese fir
it has been well-characterized that dcl <dig> pays key roles in the biogenesis of 24-nt rasirnas, the major endogenous srnas in both arabidopsis <cit>  and moss physcomitrella patens <cit> . however, reports on small rnas from gymnosperms, e.g., t. chinensis <cit>  and p. contorta <cit> , showed that they synthesize a diverse population of small rnas that are 21-nt long, while fail to produce significant amounts of 24-nt srnas. consistently, dcl <dig>  the enzyme responsible for the maturation of 24-nt rasirnas in angiosperms, appeared to be absent from conifers  <cit> . in this study, we found that the length distribution of chinese fir srnas was similar to that of many angiosperms  in having a major peak at  <dig> nt. in addition,  <dig> unigene sequences  were identified highly homologous to o. sativap. trichocarpa and p. patens dcl <dig> proteins. moreover, we revealed other unigene sequences homologous to known proteins necessary for biogenesis and action of rasirnas from the chinese fir mrna transcriptome database, including rna polymerase iv , rdr <dig> , hen <dig> , ago <dig>  and ago <dig>  . besides, <dig>  unique srnas  were able to map to the sense or antisense strand of known repeat-associated rna sequences using blastn analysis against the repeat database  , indicating that these srnas may originate from pericentromeric regions, transposons or repetitive elements. taken together, these results suggest that dcl3-dependent rasirna generation pathway may exist in chinese fir, a gymnosperm species.

mir390-tas3-arf pathway
tasirnas belong to a plant-specific class of endogenous srnas. previous studies showed that one of the conserved tasirnas, tas <dig>  plays key roles in mosses and flowering plants  <cit> . however, tas3-related genes have not been reported in gymnosperms so far. in the present investigation, we found not only one mir <dig> family member, but also three small rna sequences identical to arabidopsis tas <dig> sirnas, including sir <dig>  sir <dig> and tasir <dig>  in the chinese fir srna library . to confirm the expression of cln-mir390a and cln-tasir <dig> in chinese fir, we performed relative real-time and semi-quantitative rt-pcr analyses. the transcription levels of cln-tasir <dig> were low and did not show significant differences in the four samples examined . cln-mir390a was weakly expressed in seeds, seedling and stems and very weakly in leaves . in addition, we identified unigene sequences homologous to known proteins necessary for tasirna biogenesis and action, e.g., rdr <dig> , dcl <dig>  and ago <dig>  from our mrna transcriptome database . using the web-based target prediction program psrnatarget and chinese fir mrna transcriptome database and  <dig>  contigs from p. taeda  as the target databases, we found  <dig> contigs  annotated as arfs in p. taeda to be targets of cln-tasir <dig>  thus, our study provides strong evidence that this crucial and conserved mir390-tas3-arf regulatory pathway may exist and play important roles in chinese fir.

discussion
srna length distribution divergence among gymnosperms
previous studies showed the srna length distribution patterns of many angiosperms, e.g., arabidopsis thaliana <cit> , citrus trifoliata <cit>  and medicago truncatula <cit> , and mosses  <cit>  have a major peak at  <dig> nt. however, the length distribution patterns of srnas from two gymnosperms, taxus chinensis <cit>  and pinus contorta <cit> , constitute a major 21-nt peak and no obvious 24-nt peak is observed. a survey of srnas in  <dig> vascular plant species revealed that  <dig> conifer species fail to produce significant amounts of 24-nt srnas  <cit> . therefore, it seems that the srna length distribution patterns are significantly divergent between angiosperms and gymnosperms.

in the present study, we found that chinese fir srna length distribution pattern was similar to that of many angiosperms, having a 24-nt major peak. we speculate that the divergence in srna length distribution pattern between chinese fir and other gymnosperms may be due to two reasons. one reason is the cell or tissue type difference of the initial sample used to generate the small rna library. multiple tissues and organs in different developmental stages, including seeds, seedlings, leaves, stems and calli, were used as the initial sample in chinese fir small rna library construction, whereas only one tissue, a stem cell line of t. chinensis <cit>  or young needles of pinus contorta <cit>  or young needle tips or leaf buds of  <dig> gymnosperms  <cit> , were utilized as the initial samples in their experiments. young needles, leaf buds or stems mainly consist of terminally differentiated cells, while our sample contains not only terminally differentiated cells, but also differentiating cells, such as cells in seeds and seedlings. therefore, the divergence of srna length distribution patterns between chinese fir and other gymnosperms may be partially caused by the srna population difference between differentiating and differentiated cells. the other reason that cannot be excluded is the species differences between chinese fir and other gymnosperms.

conserved mirnas in chinese fir
in comparison with thousands of mirnas identified from angiosperms, the reported mirnas from gymnosperms are limited. only mirnas of two conifer species, pinus taeda <cit>  and picea abies <cit> , are listed in the mirbase  with a total of  <dig> and  <dig> mirnas respectively. no research has been conducted to identify mirnas from chinese fir, an economically important gymnosperm in china. in this report, we conducted the first screen for chinese fir mirnas by deep sequencing. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas belonging to  <dig> mirna families were identified in chinese fir. for the  <dig> common conserved mirna families among three model angiosperms, a. thalianao. sativa and p. trichocarpa,  <dig> mirna families were found in chinese fir, except the mir <dig> family. these results imply that the ancient mirna biogenesis and action system is well developed in the common ancestors of gymnosperms and angiosperms.

it is well-characterized that mir <dig> regulates the timing of the juvenile-to-adult transition by repressing the expression of squamosa promoter binding protein like  family of transcription factor genes in arabidopsis <cit> . ath-mir <dig> is also involved in regulating the onset of flowering  <cit> , temporal control of trichome distribution  <cit>  and securing male fertility in arabidopsis <cit> . in the present study, we identified  <dig> mirna members of the cln-mir156/ <dig> family by illumina sequencing, of which cln-mir157a is the most abundant mirna in the srna library. using semi-quantitative and quantitative rt-pcr, we found that the transcript levels of cln-mir156a and cln-mir157a were down-regulated along the juvenile-to-adult transition . moreover, we predicted  <dig> mrnas to be targets of cln-mir <dig> family mirnas . the analysis of cln-mir <dig> targets showed that  <dig> targets were spl family of transcription factor genes, including unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  in addition, unigene <dig>  encoding a protein homologous to the arabidopsis transcription factor spl <dig>  was experimentally verified to be the target of cln-mir157a by 5' race. these results suggest that cln-mir156a and cln-mir157a may regulate juvenile-to-adult transition by down-regulating the expression of spl transcription factor genes in chinese fir.

in rice, peter pan syndrome , an arabidopsis constitutive photomorphogenic <dig>  ortholog, regulates the juvenile-to-adult and vegetative-to-reproductive phase changes by controlling the expression of osa-mir <dig>  <cit> . in the present study, unigene <dig>  an arabidopsis cop <dig> ortholog, was predicted to be the target of cln-mir <dig>  indicating that cop1-mir <dig> pathway may be self-regulated during the phase change in chinese fir development. furthermore, mrnas involving in defense responses  and other metabolic pathways  were also predicted to be targets of cln-mir <dig>  these results indicate that cln-mir156/ <dig> family mirnas may be involved in multiple physiological processes in chinese fir development.

the functions of mir <dig> have been intensively studied in previous research. vÃ¡rallyay et al. reported that plant viruses repress ago <dig> accumulation by modulating endogenous mir <dig> level to alleviate the anti-viral function of ago <dig> protein  <cit> . recently, li et al. revealed a transcriptional regulatory mechanism by which mir <dig> controls ago <dig> homeostasis during aba treatment and abiotic stress responses in arabidopsis thaliana <cit> . in the present study, we found not only  <dig> mir <dig> family members, but also unigene <dig>  an ortholog of arabidopsis ago <dig>  to be the target of cln-mir168a using 5' race. these results imply that cln-mir168a may have important roles in viral infection, stress responses and other physiological processes by repressing the expression of ago <dig> in chinese fir.

previous studies have established that mir <dig> targets nac family transcription factor is well conserved in many plant species and is involved in the trifurcate feed-forward pathway to ensure aging-induced leaf senescence  <cit>  and in the lateral root development in a. thaliana <cit> . in the present experiment, we identified  <dig> mir <dig> family members and detected developmental stage-associated expression pattern of cln-mir164a in four chinese fir samples by qrt-pcr. moreover, unigene <dig>  a nac family transcription factor, was verified to be the target of cln-mir164a. these results provide direct evidence that cln-mir164a may participate in multiple physiological processes during development and growth by inhibiting the expression of nac transcription factors in chinese fir.

dcl3-dependent rasirna biogenesis pathway
the dcl3-dependent rasirna generation pathway has been reported in both angiosperms and mosses  <cit> . however, this pathway has been considered absent from gymnosperms because of the lack of significant amounts of 24-nt srnas and dcl <dig> in conifers  <cit> .

the experiments described here demonstrated that 24-nt srnas were the most abundant size class of srnas in chinese fir. in addition, we found that  <dig>  srnas could map to the sense or antisense strand of known repeat-associated dna sequences, suggesting that these srnas may be transcribed from pericentromeric regions, transposons or repetitive elements. moreover, unigene sequences homologous to the proteins necessary for the biogenesis and action of the 24-nt rasirnas were identified from the chinese fir mrna transcriptome database, including pol iv, rdr <dig>  dcl <dig>  hen <dig>  ago <dig> and ago <dig> . these results indicate that the ancient but crucial dcl3-dependent rasirna generation pathway may exist in chinese fir, a gymnosperm species.

in rice, two dcl <dig> family members have distinct roles in the generation of 24-nucleotide small rnas  <cit> . osdcl3a plays conserved roles in producing 24-nucleotide unphased small rnas, which can direct cytosine dna methylation both in cis and in trans. osdcl3b specifically acts in 24-nucleotide phased small rna biogenesis, which exhibits panicle- and early seed-specific expression and plays roles in stamens. in physcomitrella patens, dcl <dig> is required for the accumulation of 22â€“ <dig> nt sirnas, but not  <dig> nt sirnas, at pp23sr loci  <cit> . in the present investigation, we identified  <dig> unigene sequences, including unigene <dig>  unigene <dig> and unigene <dig>  highly homologous to rice dcl3a, physcomitrella patens dcl <dig>  and populus trichocarpa dcl <dig>  respectively, suggesting that unigene <dig> may be responsible for the biogenesis of 24-nucleotide unphased small rnas, whereas unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> may be involved in the producing other classes of 24-nucleotide small rnas in chinese fir.

CONCLUSIONS
using deep-sequencing technology, we obtained a comprehensive set of srnas in chinese fir, including rasirnas, conserved and novel mirnas and tasirnas. a total of  <dig> conserved mirnas comprising  <dig> mirna families and one novel mirna were identified. the expressions of  <dig> conserved and one novel mirnas and one tasirna were examined by rt-pcr. real-time quantitative pcr results demonstrated that four conserved and one novel mirnas displayed developmental stage-specific expression patterns. in addition,  <dig> unigene sequences were predicted to be the targets of  <dig> chinese fir mirna families, of which five unigene sequences were experimentally verified by 5' race. the dcl3-dependent rasirna generation pathway, which had been considered absent in conifers, was found in chinese fir. furthermore, the mir390-tas3-arf regulatory pathway was investigated. in conclusion, global identification and characterization of srnas from chinese fir expand our knowledge of conifer srnas and provide an insight into land plant srna evolution.
