BACKGROUND
the indo-pacific ocean – the origin of seagrass - has the largest number of seagrass species worldwide with huge meadows of mixed species stands, but the taxonomy of halophila members is still unclear and genetic variation has not been much investigated so far
 <cit> . in comparison to other seagrass species in the meadows, halophila ovalis  hooker is the dominant species and very commonly found in the region. recently, some new records of halophila members such as halophila major  miquel, were documented in southeast asian countries including indonesia, viet nam and thailand
 <cit> . additionally, h. sulawesii j. kuo was found and described for the first time in indonesia
 <cit> . traditional classification of h. ovalis and closely related species based on leaf morphological data is very challenging, and species misidentification among halophila members is reported in various studies
 <cit> . genetic markers are considered as helpful tools to resolve boundaries between species as well as the genetic variation among populations within species
 <cit> .

the indo-pacific ocean also shows a high diversity of landscapes, habitats as well as several existing geographic barriers. geographic isolation refers to a situation where a species, or a population of a species, becomes separated by a physical barrier, allowing each group to diverge along separate evolutionary paths
 <cit> . the effect of geographic isolation is that the two populations are subjected to different selection pressures, since the conditions in the two areas are different
 <cit> . thus different alleles will be selected and genetic differences will gradually accumulate between the populations. in general, halophytes such as mangroves, marine algae, and seagrass grow in the coastal zone, which is connective between land and sea
 <cit> . currents along the coast or ocean currents play an important role for the migration of species from one coastal area to another
 <cit> . recently, there were several studies published on mangroves
 <cit>  and animals
 <cit>  from this region revealing the genetic variation isolated by barriers.

among the members of halophila, h. ovalis is widespread in the indo-pacific ocean. in the pacific, it occurs from southern japan throughout southeast asia, many islands of the western pacific, and through all but the southern coast of australia, as well as lord howe and norfolk islands, and as far east as tonga and samoa. in the indian ocean, h. ovalis is found from southwestern australia to east africa and the red sea, including madagascar, with the exception of islands or coastlines with no records. recently, h. ovalis has been also discovered in the atlantic ocean on the island of antigua
 <cit> . the plant is diminutive and lacks strongly lignified tissue, making it flexible, but vulnerable to physical disturbances
 <cit> . halophila ovalis grows on a variety of substrates and is often the first to colonize newly available sediments
 <cit> . the species can grow at a range of temperatures and is distributed from tropical to warm-temperate waters
 <cit> . this species has a wide depth distribution as well, with individuals growing from the intertidal up to a depth of 30 m
 <cit> . like other seagrass species, h. ovalis reproduces vegetatively by branching of rhizomes and the formation of new shoots, and sexually through seeds
 <cit> . due to high variation of leaf morphology and adaptation, den hartog
 <cit>  emphasized the need for detailed studies of this species to better understand the link between morphological variability and environmental parameters.

leaf morphology is used as the main key to identify and name halophila species
 <cit> . however, traits of leaf morphology are overlapping among members of this genus
 <cit> . recently, genetic markers of plastid sequences have been used to reveal the genetic relationships among the members of the halophila genus
 <cit> . however, the species boundaries could not be fully resolved. using phylogenetic analyses of the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer  region showed that some specimens identified as h. ovalis belonged to different clades, and this clearly points out the need for critical taxonomic revision of halophila material from the entire geographic distribution of this genus
 <cit> . this nuclear sequence was also used to identify the genetic relation of h. ovalis and closely related species namely h. major, halophila nipponica j. kuo, halophila minor  den hartog and halophila hawaiana doty and b. c. stone
 <cit> .

there are several techniques including isozyme analyses
 <cit> , random amplified polymorphic dna 
 <cit> , amplified fragment length polymorphism 
 <cit>  and microsatellites
 <cit>  to access genetic variation among and between seagrass populations. the major advantage of the aflp technique is the large number of polymorphisms that the method generates compared with other markers. however, the methodology of aflp experiments and post-run data analysis are complex and time consuming compared with other markers
 <cit> . microsatellites are simple sequence repeats  with advantages like locus-specificity, co-dominance, high degree of polymorphism, and it is also possible to work with partially degraded dna
 <cit> . so far there is only little information of dna fingerprinting techniques applied for h. ovalis.

it is hypothesized that  taxonomic uncertainty among different populations of h. ovalis persists and  geographic distance, differentiation of habitats or the geographic barrier of the indo-malay peninsula may affect the genetic variation of h. ovalis from the western pacific to the eastern indian ocean. the aims of this study are  to identify halophila species collected in hong kong, thailand, malaysia and india based on the molecular marker  and  to search for the genetic structure of h. ovalis from the western pacific to the eastern indian ocean based on microsatellite and aflp approaches.

RESULTS
species identification based on the nuclear its sequences and morphology
nineteen its sequences  achieved from haplotypes collected at  <dig> populations of halophila spp. in the study sites shown in figure 
 <dig> and listed in table 
 <dig> were used for the phylogenetic analysis. the alignment of the sequences received from three independent pcrs revealed that there were no nucleotide differences among replications. fragments of 18s and 28s were removed to gain only the sequence of its1- <dig> s-its <dig> . a final alignment of 628 bp  was generated for its1- <dig> s-its <dig>  of which  <dig>  were parsimony informative characters,  <dig>  were variable sites,  <dig>  were conserved sites, and  <dig>  were singleton sites. results of the four algorithms applied , neighbor joining , maximum parsimony  and bayesian analysis ) showed that all samples collected from the  <dig> populations were distributed into two clades consisting of h. major  and h. ovalis  with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and 99% bootstrap values, respectively. there was no difference in the topology of the phylogenetic trees based on these different methods except for small differences in the bootstrap values. in clade i, haplotypes   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> clustered with known h. major sequences. in clade ii, the remaining haplotypes clustered with known sequences from h. ovalis. none of the samples clustered with known sequences from h. minor . the results also showed that nucleotide differences among individuals of the h. major clade and among individuals of the h. ovalis clade were zero to six nucleotides and zero to three nucleotides, respectively. however, the counts of different nucleotides between the two clades were  <dig> to  <dig>  in addition, evolutionary divergence among individuals of the h. major clade and among individuals of the h. ovalis clade was  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. evolutionary divergence between the two clades was  <dig>  to  <dig> . the results clearly indicate that haplotypes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> need to be classified as h. major and samples collected at th-tr  need to be grouped into the h. ovalis clade instead with h. minor sequences. for both countries, malaysia and myanmar, it is the first time that h. major was recorded.

the morphological data also supported the results obtained from the molecular its data. for the samples identified as h. major based on its, five characters of leaf morphology including lamina width, lamina length, number of cross-veins, space between intra-marginal veins, and especially the ratio of the distance between intra-marginal vein  and lamina margin  showed clear differences in comparison to h. ovalis. the ratio of the distance between the intra-marginal vein and the lamina margin was 1: <dig>  to 1: <dig> . in contrast, this ratio was 1: <dig> to 1: <dig> in h. ovalis <cit> . moreover, the number of paired cross veins of h. major was  <dig> to  <dig> and therefore higher than the number of paired cross veins in h. ovalis 
 <cit> . the p-values obtained from levene’s test of lamina width, lamina length, number of paired cross veins were lower than  <dig>  . in contrast, the p-values obtained from levene’s test of the ratio r/r was higher than  <dig>  . single factor anova shows that for the ratio  significant differences can be observed among the collection sites . details resulting from multiple comparisons of each trait obtained by the tukey test showed that there were significant differences of the ratio  between populations at my-mb, my-gs, mm-gt  and the remaining populations . details of comparisons of the leaf morphology of h. major and h. ovalis are presented in table

for the western pacific ocean, genetic distances among populations in regions i, ii, iii, iv, v and vi  were very high. in detail, the genetic distance between region i and iii was the highest . there were lower genetic distances between region ii and region v . however, the genetic distance between ii and vi was lower than the genetic distance between vi and iii . within region ii, the genetic distance between vn-vp and vn-tt  was  <dig> . in contrast, genetic distances among populations greatly varied from population to population, ranking from  <dig>  to  <dig> , in which the genetic distance between my-mg and my-bd was the lowest and the genetic distance between my-sb and my-tg was the highest . results of amova for ssrs variation of h. ovalis populations in the western pacific ocean showed significant differentiation among groups , among populations within groups  and within populations  . hence, high genetic distance and statistical differences were not only found among regions, but also among populations in the western pacific ocean. the overall genetic variation from the halophila populations in the western pacific ocean was  <dig>  calculated from fstat.

for the eastern indian ocean, a very high genetic distance between the two regions vii and ix, ranking from  <dig>  to  <dig>  was observed . for the andaman sea, the genetic distance between two populations, th-sa and th-tr, was determined as zero and non-significant . in contrast, the genetic distance between in-ma and in-ka was very high and significantly different . the results of amova for ssrs variation of h. ovalis populations in the two regions vii and ix  indicated that the percentage of variations among groups, among populations within groups and within populations were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> %, respectively. significant difference was just found among groups and among populations within groups  and there were no significant differences within populations . moreover, the results of amova for ssrs variation of h. ovalis populations in both oceanic systems  showed significant differences among groups , among populations within groups , and within populations . the overall genetic variation from the halophila populations in the eastern indian ocean was  <dig>  calculated from fstat.

the unrooted neighbor-joining tree among  <dig> populations from eight regions in the western pacific and eastern indian ocean showed six main groups including group  <dig> - region i: northern part of the south china sea , group  <dig> - region ii and v: western part of the south china sea and the gulf of thailand , group  <dig> – region iii and iv: eastern part of the south china sea and the celebes sea , group  <dig> – region 6: southern part of the south china sea , group  <dig> – region vii: andaman sea  and group  <dig> – region ix: bay of bengal  . the multi-locus estimate of spatial differentiation among  <dig> populations relative to the whole sampled distribution was large . the correlation between geographic and genetic distances in the study area is presented in figure

based on  <dig> its sequences from h. ovalis, there are eight distinct haplotypes found in  <dig> populations . haplotype i  commonly occurred in the south china sea, celebes sea and andaman sea. haplotypes ii  and iii  were found in my-bd and my-gm , respectively, and haplotype iv  in my-jo only. in the andaman sea, there was one more haplotype present – haplotype v . three haplotypes  that did not occur in the south china sea, celebes sea and andaman sea were found in the bay of bengal. haplotype vi  was identified in in-ka, while haplotypes vii  and viii  were detected in in-ma .

for the aflp analysis, the genetic similarities  among the  <dig> individual h. ovalis samples were estimated based on the number of common fragments ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> . it also showed that the similarity values of the populations within the andaman sea  and within the gulf of thailand  were  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig> , respectively. the similarity values between the populations of th-tr and th-sa were higher than between the population of th-tr and th-kn .

the cluster analysis  revealed that h. ovalis populations were divided into two groups, either collected in the gulf of thailand or in the andaman sea . however, results of clustering individuals of th-tr and th-sa were not significant. the plot of a principal coordinate analysis , based on individual genetic distances calculated with  <dig> aflp markers, is presented in additional file
 <dig>  the first two axes explained  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the variation, respectively . as axis two explained 3% of variance only, it is evident that the remaining axes contribute poorly to explain the variance. results of pcoa also indicated that h. ovalis was clearly distributed in two main clades: gulf of thailand clade and andaman sea clade.

discussion
the present study is the first report of genetic diversity, as well as genetic differences, within and among populations of h. ovalis collected from the western pacific ocean to the eastern indian ocean using nuclear sequence comparison  and two dna fingerprinting approaches: aflp and ssrs. conformation of new records for h. major in malaysia and myanmar and detection of high levels of polymorphism underlined impressively that genetic markers are powerful tools for species identification and assessing genetic diversity in seagrass.

new records of halophila major for malaysia and myanmar
variation of leaf morphology has been detected within several species of the halophila genus, namely h. ovalis <cit> , h. hawaiana <cit> , and h. nipponica <cit> . short et al.
 <cit>  argued that the taxonomy of h. major was unclear, because of overlapping leaf characteristics between h. ovalis and h. major. molecular markers, especially its, were shown to be a valuable tool in resolving genetic relationships among the species of halophila. for instance, halophila euphlebia makino was once treated as synonym for h. ovalis <cit> ; then, this species was transferred to h. major <cit> . results of uchimura et al.
 <cit>  and shimada et al.
 <cit>  supported the conclusion of kuo et al.
 <cit>  that h. major and h. ovalis are distinct species based on its analysis and morphological data. recently, short et al.
 <cit>  suggested that species in general should be accepted as a new species only if a complete published taxonomic description existed, documenting unique sexual reproductive characters and significant genetic differences. there are three and six species of halophila currently reported in myanmar and malaysia, respectively,
 <cit>  not including h. major. halophila major has been found in the recent years along the coastlines of southeast asian countries including indonesia, thailand, viet nam and japan
 <cit> . as it was demonstrated recently that halophila members could not be fully resolved among closely related species such as h. ovalis, h. major and h. ovata gaudich based on concatenated sequences of the two plastid markers rbcl and matk
 <cit> . in contrast, the phylogenetic analysis of the nuclear its sequence indicated that h. ovalis, h. major and h. minor are distinct species
 <cit> . hence, the use of the its marker to classify the entire set of samples collected for this study is the best choice based on the current knowledge. in this study, cluster analysis, direct comparison of nucleotide differences and evolutionary divergence between the two clades h. ovalis and h. major revealed that the materials collected in mabul island  and gusungan island , both in malaysia, and one population  in myanmar differ significantly from the h. ovalis clade. moreover, four methods of constructing phylogenic trees also indicated that materials collected in mabul island and gusungan island  and myanmar are h. major. only the indications of the molecular methods initiated a detailed microscopic analysis of the leaf samples. the leaf morphology based on the ratio of the distance between the intra-marginal vein and the lamina margin confirmed the its analysis. hence, morphological and nuclear sequence  analysis indicated that the materials collected in mabul island and gusungan island  and one population in myanmar are actually h. major. in the field this kind of analysis is usually not possible, but our results suggest that careful analysis of seagrass samples need to be conducted before classifying them as h. ovalis.

the indo-pacific region has the largest number of seagrass species worldwide and this region was considered as the origin of the hydrocharitaceae family
 <cit> . malaysia not only shows the highest number of halophila species, summing up to seven species
 <cit> , this study, but also the highest diversity of h. ovalis haplotypes: there are four haplotypes found in six populations in malaysia. in contrast, nguyen et al.
 <cit>  found only one haplotype in four populations in viet nam. this finding is congruent with the hypothesis of malaysia being the center of origin of the seagrasses.

genetic and geographic distance of h. ovalis based on ssrs
the genetic diversity indices showed relatively high values from  <dig>  to  <dig> . compared to results reported from other studies on seagrass species including z. marina 
 <cit> , 
 <cit> , zostera noltii hornemann 
 <cit> , posidonia oceanica  delile 
 <cit>  and cymodocea nodosa  ascherson 
 <cit> , 
 <cit>  using ssrs markers showed that the genetic diversity of h. ovalis is lower. unfortunately, there are no studies on the genetic diversity of h. ovalis based on ssrs markers for direct comparison so far. in other aflp approaches of seagrass species the genetic diversity such as thalassia testudinum banks ex könig  is slightly higher or much lower than in our results, such as for z. marina . hence, the genetic diversity of seagrass varied indeed from species to species, geographic distribution, and different dna fingerprinting approaches.

the present distribution of the genetic structure within species is influenced by evolutionary history
 <cit> . in this study, genetic and amova analyses indicated significant genetic differences among populations in the western pacific ocean , among populations in the eastern indian ocean , and larger significant differences among  <dig> populations surveyed in the western pacific ocean and the eastern indian ocean . all above results indicated that great genetic differentiation among populations was detected and/or gene flow among populations is very low. for the celebes sea, pair wise genetic differentiation among populations showed genetic differentiation although the geographic distance among populations is about  <dig> to 40 km. however, genetic differentiation between my-mg and my-bd is very low  in contrast to other populations in the celebes sea. this could be explained by the diversity of the habitat such as substratum, currents, and time exposure to air during low tide etc., and those factors may affect the genetic differentiation. japar et al.
 <cit>  stated that there are remarkable variations of h. ovalis, which grows in different substratum and depth. significant genetic differences were also found in z. marina between the wadden sea and the baltic sea where geographic distance among populations is within areas of  <dig> to 50 km
 <cit> . leaf morphology  of h. ovalis collected in tiga island showed great differences in comparison to the other populations in the celebes sea .

for the south china sea, there are very great genetic differentiations among populations in the northern part of the south china sea  and the remaining populations in the western, eastern and southern part of the south china sea. perhaps high latitude  in the northern part of the south china sea may lead to the genetic differentiation. both populations collected in viet nam also showed significant differences, although the geographic distance between two populations is less than 100 km. in fact, there are great differences between the environmental conditions from two populations, in the lagoon and in the open sea. it could be explained by the differentiation of salinity, with high salinity  and low salinity . the genetic difference between h. ovalis populations in the open sea and the lagoon were also found in india based on aflp data
 <cit> . for the population of the gulf of thailand, the results indicated low genetic differentiation between populations in thailand and the western part of the south china sea. perhaps there was no geographic barrier found between the western part of the south china sea and the gulf of thailand. a study of morton and blackmore
 <cit>  shows surface currents between the gulf of thailand and the western part of the south china sea, that frequently occur in both summer and winter season.

the genetic differentiation between populations in the andaman sea and in the bay of bengal is significantly different. this could be explained by a very long geographic distance  between the bay of bengal and the andaman sea. however, there is no significant genetic differentiation between populations of th-tr and th-sa in the andaman sea. perhaps short geographic distances and the same habitat are the main causes that led to the high similarity between the two populations. results from aflp analysis also indicated that the genetic distance between populations from th-tr and th-sa within the andaman sea is much lower than between populations from the andaman sea and the gulf of thailand. moreover, surface currents in the winter  and in the summer 
 <cit>  support species dispersal between th-tr and th-sa. in contrast, genetic differentiation between populations from in-ka and in-ma was also high. it could be explained by the geographic distance as well as habitat differences .

the result from the unrooted neighbor-joining tree based on slatkin’s genetic distance showed the identified six main clusters corresponding to populations from different regions. based on the genetic distance, the population in my-jo seems to be in between the western pacific and the eastern indian ocean, which corresponds to the geographic distribution of h. ovalis populations in the study. however, one of the most striking results is the unexpected result in the case of the hk-tc population. it showed no simple relationship between genetic differentiation and distance between pairs of population. the hk-tc population was genetically closer to the population in the eastern indian ocean than to populations in the western pacific ocean. at present we are unable to explain this puzzling result.

role of the thai–malay peninsula as a geographic barrier to h. ovalis populations in thailand based on aflp analysis
among a total of  <dig> bands,  <dig>  were polymorphic bands. this contrasts with a level of variability of 30% using aflp in land plant species, such as rice
 <cit> . in a recent study by nguyen et al.
 <cit>  it was shown that the  <dig> % of polymorphic bands are presented in the h. ovalis – h. ovata complex. high level of polymorphic bands has previously been reported in thalassia testudinum banks ex könig
 <cit>  and zostera marina linnaeus
 <cit>  using aflp. the percentage of polymorphic bands varies from species to species, geographic distribution, and primer combinations. for the band-based approach performed in this study, the similarity index showed comparable values to the similarity index of h. ovalis populations found in india
 <cit> . comparison between clustering analysis   and pcoa  showed that the pattern of clustering the taxa was similar with both analyses: the individuals collected in the gulf of thailand clustered as single clade, whereas individuals collected in the andaman sea grouped together. amova results  also indicate this variation between two groups. in this study, pair wise genetic differentiation  and genetic distance  among populations support the hypothesis that h. ovalis in the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea are genetically different. the results from aflp analysis are also in agreement with the results of its analysis when different haplotypes in the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea were classified. in addition, the previous studies on marine animals
 <cit>  and mangroves
 <cit>  also indicated that the thai-malay peninsula is an effective geographic barrier for populations of different organisms in the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea.

based on its, aflp and ssrs analysis of genetic variation of h. ovalis, results indicated that the genetic markers are powerful tools to assess the genetic differentiation on the broad sample collection sites. however, the sample size was still low and in the case of th-kn that may affect the standard error of the diversity in the population of the species as discussed by singh et al.
 <cit> . according to all our results, missing haplotypes were made visible in the haplotype network, hence we recommend the collection of more samples from populations in the philippines, somewhere between the two mainlands of malaysia , and somewhere between the andaman sea and the bay of bengal  to be included in future studies.

CONCLUSIONS
our study documented the new records of h. major for malaysia and myanmar. the study also revealed that the thai-malay peninsula is a geographic barrier of h. ovalis populations in the western pacific and the eastern indian ocean. characteristics of habitat are also an ecological barrier to the evolution of h. ovalis in the smaller scale area.
