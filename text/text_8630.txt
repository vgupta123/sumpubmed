BACKGROUND
repeated domains in proteins are associated with a broad spectrum of functions. they have originated from repetitive dna elements, including transposons, retroviruses, and other parasitic elements that impact genome dynamics. while most of these events are deleterious, some may lead to new proteins or protein domains, as was shown for alu repeats in primates  <cit> . repeated sequences may account for the majority of the genetic material in many eukaryotic genomes, among them the human genome  <cit> . some repeated sequences may result in open reading frames  of substantial length. if these sequences are integrated into an actively transcribed region, subsequent events such as recombination and gene conversion can spread this repeated sequence, resulting in fast amplification of the original orf  <cit> .

tandem repeats  in proteins are of various types. at one extreme are those based on a single amino acid repeat. slippage during dna replication could yield a repeated unit of exactly  <dig> nucleotides, resulting in the gain of a single amino acid. it has also been found that most mono-amino acid repeats in primates are encoded by gc-rich isochores  <cit> , but there exists a strong purifying selection against such short repeats at the dna level  <cit> . the over-represented mono-amino acid repeats in eukaryotes are glutamine , proline , glutamic acid , asparagine , aspartic acid , and serine . mono-amino acid repeats appear mostly in transcription factors and protein kinases  <cit> , where they occupy flexible regions and loops. interestingly, the number of repeated glutamines  in key proteins correlates with the severity of huntington disease and fragile x syndrome  <cit> .

a tr protein may contain short repeat units , which occur tens and hundreds of times in tandem. in such cases, the tr units typically form an extended structure, with this phenomenon quite common in structural proteins such as collagens, keratins, antifreeze proteins, and spider silks. such structural proteins and others, like the fg-rich proteins of the nuclear pore  <cit> , possess unique biophysical and thermodynamic properties.

about  <dig> interpro entries  <cit>  are characterized as 'repeats'. these are protein regions that do not fold into a globular domain on their own  <cit> . often, several of these repeats are needed to form a globular domain. known examples for repeated domains that provide the scaffold of the protein are ankyrin , keltch , trp  and armadillo  repeats. the stable 3d structures of these domain families rely on the rearrangement of their repeated units; for example, the repeat unit of wd <dig> represents a four-stranded β-sheet arrangement. in fact, many of the repeated domains are rich in β-sheets, where these proteins typically participate in a network of interactions such as in cell-cell contact, pathogen adhesion  <cit> , and cell signaling.

several methods and tools for detecting repeats in large protein databases are available  <cit> . trs that are characterized by a predefined periodicity are categorized in the trips database  <cit> . tools such as hhrep  <cit>  and pepper  <cit>  efficiently address genome-scale search for multiple repeats in proteins. the latter is suitable for analyzing sequences of fibrous proteins. trppred is a tool that was optimized for identifying repeated units in several protein families including trp  <cit> . the xstream server  <cit>  is a sensitive tool for detecting trs on a large-scale. furthermore, it permits flexibility in defining trs, by fine-tuning the parameters to successfully detect trs in dna or protein sequences. the xstream server does not tolerate non-conserved spacers between the tr units. therefore, proteins having multiple repeated domains  do not necessarily fulfill the xstream definition of tr-proteins.

currently, most multicellular model organisms that have been studied come from bilateria. an important step toward the study of metazoan evolution comes from the eumetazoan phylum cnidaria, a lineage that includes corals, sea anemones, jellyfish, and hydroids. a genomic perspective on the metazoan origin comes from the recently sequenced genomes of the choanoflagellate monosiga brevicollis  <cit> , the starlet sea anemone nematostella vectensis, and hydra magnipapillata  <cit> . the addition of genomic information from several porifera  contributed to the reconstruction of the evolutionary position of metazoa with respect to fungi  <cit> . surprisingly, many genes that were initially regarded as vertebrate-specific have in fact been identified in the n. vectensis genome  <cit> . these genomes allowed researchers to estimate the branch linking cnidaria and the bilateria to have occurred 650- <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

herein, we focus on the prevalence of trs in the sea anemone proteome. when comparing it to other genomes, a surprising enrichment in the size and complexity of its trs is evident. the diversity of the tr sequences from n. vectensis is considerably higher than that identified in any other multicellular eukaryotic genome. the properties of the trs in n. vectensis are discussed in view of their evolutionary potential as a source for gene novelty. we discuss the advantages of expansion and increased diversity of tr-proteins as a robust mode for constructing new genes with unique functional properties.

RESULTS
scarlet sea anemone proteome is exceptionally rich in tandem repeats
an increased number of sequenced genomes led to a revised view of the origin of metazoan life. the eumetazoan clade contains taxa with nervous systems and muscle cells: cnidaria, ctenophora, and bilateria  <cit> . in addition, the complete proteome of the starlet sea anemone, nematostella vectensis, provides insight into gene invention dating hundreds of millions of years ago back to the last common cnidarian-bilaterian ancestor  <cit> . the n. vectensis genome allows us to examine the evolution of an ancestral genome that is rich in trs. examples of tr-proteins that fulfill this definition are shown in figure 1a. proteins a7sw <dig> and a7s5v <dig>  share a repeated unit of  <dig> amino acids  with a copy number of  <dig>  and  <dig>  in addition, two other repeated units are found in a7sw <dig>  with a copy number of  <dig>  and  <dig> . the remaining portions of the proteins are not identified as trs. tr-units are defined by at least  <dig> repeated units, each with a minimal length of  <dig> amino acids, with no intervening sequences. these are non-overlapping sequences that are identified according to the xstream tool  <cit>  . the number of unique trs may differ from that of tr-proteins as the same tr-unit might occur in numerous proteins and the same tr-unit often appears in several segments on a particular protein .

we compared the occurrence of protein tr sequences in n. vectensis in view of other complete proteomes, including fly , human, mouse, frog, and more. we restricted our analysis to those trs for which all repeats share >80% sequence identity with the respective consensus repeat sequence .

the complete proteome of n. vectensis includes  <dig>  predicted proteins, where half of these are marked as fragments. the number of proteins identified with trs was as high as  <dig>  of which  <dig> are unique tr-units. when comparing the trs in n. vectensis and other proteomes, the most striking difference is in the number of unique trs. in n. vectensis, ~16% of all protein sequences are tr-containing proteins. when employing the same parameters, tr containing sequences account for only 3% of the drosophila melanogaster proteome .

an exhaustive comparison of the tr properties for representative proteomes, spanning an evolutionary range from n. vectensis to human, was performed. the selected organisms represent major evolutionary branches, covering worm , insects , plant , vertebrate , marine chordata , cnidaria , mammals , metazoan parasite  and choanoflagellate .

when the fraction of tr containing proteins  relative to the total nematostella proteome is considered , we noted a 2- <dig> fold enrichment in the fraction of such proteins relative to the other organisms tested.

most n. vectensis tandem repeat units are unique
while the fraction of tr-proteins in n. vectensis is higher than in any other tested organism, the usage of any particular tr is typically restricted. most tr-units are used only once in n. vectensis . in mouse and human, each tr appears on average in  <dig>  and  <dig>  proteins, respectively. for example, in the mouse proteome, there are ~ <dig> tr-proteins, yet they are composed of only ~ <dig> unique trs. while the genomes of human and mouse are quite active in reusing their repeated sequences  <cit> , no clear view was presented for the dynamics of trs in n. vectensis  <cit> . moreover, the fraction occupied by a tr within the tr-protein  is substantially higher in n. vectensis . this extreme tr-coverage  reflects the fact that almost half of n. vectensis proteins are marked as fragments due to missing exons . the 25% coverage measured for human  and mouse  is still higher than the coverage determined for the other organisms tested, mainly insects and frog.

characterizing the properties of tr-containing proteins from n. vectensis
the > <dig> trs of n. vectensis were statistically analyzed to determine the most prevalent repeat properties in terms of number of tr units, their length, and the overall regions they occupy. figure  <dig> shows the abundance of these tr-units. it is evident that a unit length of 10- <dig> amino acids is most prevalent . furthermore, an inverse correlation is observed between the number of tr-units within a tr-segment  and the length of that basic unit . thus, in most cases, the total region that is occupied by trs in n. vectensis remains within the range of  <dig> to  <dig> amino acids . the average length of a tr-segment in a protein is  <dig> amino acids. figure 3c shows the accumulated level of variations relative to the tr consensus, where trs with deviations ranging from  <dig> to accumulated changes in 20% of its amino acids  are analyzed. the trs from human and n. vectensis demonstrate clear differences. while most trs in human have diverged substantially, this is not the case for n. vectensis . it is possible that trs in human and n. vectensis differ in their tendency to accumulate and maintain variations. a substantial number of trs in human  and in n. vectensis  shows no variations  but most of them  are short trs . an attractive idea suggests that the higher variation observed in mouse  and human  coincide with the high usability of each tr-unit in human and mouse but not in nematostella . a similar trend was proposed for the accelerated evolution of duplicated paralogous genes  <cit> . a similar analysis performed for the ~ <dig> tr-segments of hydra indicated an intermediate rate of variation .

we expanded the comparative study to proteomes that are evolutionarily closer to n. vectensis, such as hydra. recently, a hydra genome  was sequenced and a predicted protein set of  <dig>  models was presented . the fraction of unique tr-units within the hydra complete proteome is ~5% .

athe fraction of fragments is based on the uniprotkb collection.

the difference in the absolute number of proteins and the fraction of proteins marked as 'fragments'  is a proxy for the knowledge and annotation quality . the high fraction of partial proteins  is consistent with their shorter average length . we included in the analysis leishmania major, a protozoan parasite that underwent rapid evolution and for which many proteins are known to contain trs. table  <dig> shows that the exceptionally high proportion of proteins with trs in n. vectensis is a unique property of this organism and has not been reported to such an extent even in protozoan parasites.

to ensure that the trends seen in table  <dig> do not solely reflect the poor quality of the assembly and protein annotations reported  <cit> , we repeated the analysis but eliminated all sequences that include undefined nucleotides  or sequences that could not match exactly their transcripts . even after such filtration, the fraction of trs for n. vectensis still remains exceptionally high .

amino acid composition of n. vectensis tandem repeats
we analyzed the over-representation and under-representation of amino acids in tr-proteins, in comparison with all other n. vectensis proteins. we found that several amino acids, most notably histidine , cysteine , tyrosine , proline , and threonine  were enriched, with c and h being the most significantly so . on the other hand, we observed that polar and charged amino acids are strongly depleted in the tr sequences. specifically, the most depleted amino acids are phenylalanine , glutamic acid , and lysine . similar enrichment and depletion in amino acid preference were evident when compared to the swissprot database . in addition to the distinct biophysical properties of these under-represented amino acids, it is of interest that their codons tends to be at rich and they are mostly coded by a limited number of codons .

a significant difference in amino acid composition exists between n. vectensis tr and non-tr proteins . we thus tested whether the amino acid composition in trs of n. vectensis is similar to that of other organisms. specifically, we compared the n. vectensis trs to the ~ <dig> unique trs from human. when comparing the tr sequences , a relative enrichment in tyrosine  is evident, and to a lesser extent c, i, l, and v. interestingly, relative to the human repeats, the trs from n. vectensis are more enriched with amino acids that tend to form ordered structures , suggesting that these repeats may be better suited to form structural units. similar trends were evident in comparisons with other vertebrate tr-proteins. the most dominant predicted secondary structure associated with the tr repeats is the β-sheet .

sequence robustness of tandem repeats revealed by multiple open reading frames
among the  <dig>  orfs predicted for n. vectensis  <cit> ,  <dig> tr-proteins were selected . we tested the extent of valid alternative reading frames among this large set of tr-proteins. in fact, due to the shortage in experimental evidence , and the absence of any direct protein information, the reading frame may not be correct. typically, computational inference for a specific frame is based on an appropriate kozak sequence near the initiating methionine, on the knowledge of codon usage bias, and on conservation criteria from homology and paralogy. at present, ~50% of the tr-proteins lack an initiating methionine and a similar fraction  holds for the rest of the predicted proteins.

we analyzed the properties of the alternative reading frames for tr-proteins. for this analysis, the set of all tr-segments from n. vectensis was compiled . for each such tr-segment, we inspected all alternative reading frames , a total of  <dig>  potential orfs. averaging over all  <dig> frame shifts,  <dig> % of these arfs do not contain a stop codon , i.e., they adhere to the minimal definition of being valid orfs. to put this result within a statistical context, we performed a simulation for  <dig> random orf sequences, generated based on the nucleotide composition of the coding sequences of the n. vectensis tr-proteins. in this random simulation, only  <dig> % of the arfs did not contain a stop codon, thus hinting at the possible significance of this beneficial use of repeated sequences to yield valid arfs. somewhat surprisingly, the high fraction of valid arfs also carried over for those of the reverse complement strand . in our analysis, we found that only ~ <dig> tr-proteins  can be read exclusively in the annotated reading frame. on the other hand, for most of the sequences, there are at least 2- <dig> additional orfs , many of which are potentially long. for example, when limiting the analysis to arfs  with length > <dig> nucleotides,  <dig> such instances were found .

an analysis of the tr-proteins showed that the overall amino acid composition is rather similar for all  <dig> reading frames on the coding strand, when the alternative frames are open; . note that in cases when the reverse complement frames are also valid, the translated sequences are also often similar in composition to the original frame . it is important to note that there is a unique scenario, for which repeats of a nucleotide unit will necessarily result in the same amino acid sequence for all  <dig> reading frames on a strand, with cyclic shifts only in the start and end of the sequence. figure 5d demonstrates an example where a repeat of  <dig> nucleotides leads to a tr-unit of  <dig> amino acids. this phenomenon is actually a byproduct of the basic repeat unit  having any length that is not a multiple of  <dig>  we found that only for 18% of all tr-proteins  was this phenomenon present. clearly, in such cases, the amino acid composition will remain fixed. nonetheless, we found the composition to be fixed for almost all tr-proteins .

limited conservation of n. vectensis tr-units along the phylogenetic tree
we tested to what extent the  <dig> trs from n. vectensis is evolutionarily conserved. we focused on representative proteomes for comparison with n. vectensis. figure 6a shows a tree view of the major branches from the metazoan-fungi separation and within the metazoa kingdom. the venn diagrams of tr-proteins indicate the number of tr-proteins that are shared among human, mouse, and nematostella . a broader evolutionary perspective is presented by comparing nematostella with hydra  and monosiga . shared tr-proteins are defined by the identity of their tr-units, as calculated by xstream  <cit> . we noted that even human and mouse share only  <dig> tr-proteins, while the overlap between n. vectensis and human and n. vectensis and mouse is even lower . the analysis of unique trs shows that 6% of the unique trs from n. vectensis are also found in human and mouse . among these, only  <dig> tr-proteins are shared among all  <dig> proteomes. while some of the tr-units that are shared among the tested proteomes are rather long, ~50-60% of them are shorter than  <dig> amino acids. a similar comparison relative to the hydra proteome indicated that 10% and  <dig> % of the tr-proteins are shared with hydra and monosiga, respectively . only  <dig> tr-proteins are conserved among all  <dig> tested species. we concluded that a limited number of tr-units are shared in evolution and the expansion of the tr-proteome is indicative of nematostella and to a much lesser degree of hydra. for more details, see additional file  <dig>

a functional perspective of n. vectensis repeats
the fraction of pfam and interpro entries that are represented among all n. vectensis proteins is slightly lower than that for well-studied genomes . when the set of tr-proteins is considered, only 31% appear with a pfam entry that is repeated at least twice. thus, most of the tr-proteins are undefined by pfam and interpro databases. of course, the strict requirement of tandemness in the trs excludes proteins with non-conserved linkers between domains  from the analysis.

we thus set out to test the appearance of repeats in the n. vectensis proteome in view of the  <dig> repeat types that are reported by interpro . most of the repeats that are supported by pfam  are not found in n. vectensis. for those found in n. vectensis, we focused on the  <dig> repeat types that are represented by at least  <dig> proteins in n. vectensis. when compared to humans, no marked difference in copy number is shown for most of these repeats . for  <dig> such repeat domains, n. vectensis exhibits a moderate preference for a higher copy number. for almost half of the instances, the opposite tendency is detected. since many of the n. vectensis proteins are incomplete , this analysis may underestimate the actual copy number of the trs in the full sequences. we conclude that, overall, the copy numbers for the pfam repeats that are well-represented in n. vectensis are rather similar to the copy numbers of these repeats in human .

evolutionary divergence rate for tandem repeat units
the large number of tr-proteins in n. vectensis and the observation that they are mostly uniquely used in its proteins raises the question: which evolutionary forces act on such repeats? we set out to study whether the evolution of these tandem repeats has been subject to neutral, purifying, or positive selection. we thus applied an analysis based on the ratio of asynonymous to synonymous substitutions . due to the shortage of experimental evidence for many of the predicted proteins from n. vectensis, we limited this analysis to the tr-proteins that are supported by ests . for the  <dig> sequences analyzed, ~40% of them exhibit a ratio of ka/ks >  <dig> , while ~50% show the opposite trend. among the instances of tr-proteins with ka/ks> <dig>  several of them seem to exhibit extremely high ratios, which strongly supports the notion of positive selection on these tandem repeats.

discussion
n. vectensis proteome quality and missing annotations
all analyses we performed for the n. vectensis and h. magnipapillata tr-proteins are susceptible to the quality of assembly from the shotgun libraries  <cit> . the genome of n. vectensis is composed of a large number of disconnected contigs. transposable elements constitute ~26% of the assembled genome, and they are associated with ~ <dig> families that are considered evolutionary young. the number of dna transposon types found in the sea anemone is the highest among eukaryotic species  <cit> .

in n. vectensis, only  <dig>  ests were used to support the proteome annotation. these ests led to the validation of ~ <dig> protein sequences. in addition, ~ <dig>  paired clone end sequences were generated, resulting in  <dig>  predicted gene models. it has been estimated that about a third of the predicted proteins may be subjected to future annotation efforts  <cit> . we conducted our analysis on  <dig>  proteins that are supported by uniprotkb . about  <dig> tr-proteins are reported following an analysis using stricter criteria . currently, collections from cnidaria ests  are available: anemonia viridis , metridium senile , and acropora palmate ; and porites astreoides, aiptasia pallida, acropora millepora with ~ <dig>  ests each. we expect that the coverage of trs in n. vectensis  will be revised upon improved annotations and additional experimental data. we are currently testing the expression of predicted tr-proteins from n. vectensis.

dna repeats as a source of novel coding sequences
most multicellular eukaryotic genomes contain repetitive sequences. these sequences provide the basis for the study of genome dynamics, recombination, and gene conversion  <cit> . in general, dna repeats are believed to serve as a principal source of gene novelty. repetitive nucleotide sequences such as micro- and mini-satellites have been subjected to rapid gains and losses throughout evolution  <cit> .

a survey on internal repeats in protein sequence databases  <cit>  indicated that eukaryotes have a 3- <dig> fold higher incidence of internal repeats, as compared to prokaryotes or archaea  <cit> . furthermore, long proteins often resulted from the concatenation of internal trs. we propose that the n. vectensis tr basic architectures are attractive for creating new proteins through recombination and copy number adjustment. for a simple sequence  above a certain length, it is rare to detect valid arfs. usually, only one orf  can be found, while frame shifts of this orf are unavoidably punctuated by stop codons. however, we noted that for ~ <dig> tr instances, both arf frame + <dig> and frame + <dig> are valid as orfs.

it was recently suggested that ~ <dig> long overlooked arfs are expressed in humans  <cit> , in addition to several previously studied arfs . when we applied similar criteria to identify arf candidates among n. vectensis tr-proteins,  <dig> such instances were found . the average fraction of valid arfs for the tr-proteins in n. vectensis is disproportionately high , when considering only the size distribution of these proteins. the analysis of all tr-proteins shows that all  <dig> frames provide a rather similar overall picture  of amino acid composition, even when this is not mathematically guaranteed.

the probability for a stop codon  decreases as gc content increases  <cit> . in nematostella tr-proteins, the strong bias towards multiple orfs was not associated with high gc content. the gc content for the tr-units is similar to that of the proteome as a whole . for humans, the gc content of the entire proteome is higher  and similar to that of its tr units . we conclude that the length of trs and their complexity is not a reflection of the gc content.

tandem repeats with structural and functional characteristics
the energetics and kinetics of tr-containing proteins provide new insights into folding rates and protein stability  <cit> . in n. vectensis, the tr-units are of an average length of 10- <dig> amino acids , but a tr-segment is of ~ <dig> amino acids on average . this is in the range of a foldable unit and the size of most structural global units in proteins  <cit> . for most trs, there is no functional or structural information. in fact, the annotation of 'predicted protein' covers 96% of the n. vectensis proteins and  <dig> % of the tr-proteins.

we tested the tr segments of n. vectensis for their secondary structure propensities using the jpred <dig> server  <cit> . for this analysis, we used all valid arf sequences that were at least  <dig> amino acids long . since jpred, as other prediction methods, strongly rely on homology through psi-blast, it was not surprising that for most arfs, no globular homolog was found. on average, 83% of the positions were predicted as disordered coils , 7% of the positions predicted as beta sheet , and 10% as alpha helix . nonetheless, some of these arfs  were predicted to have between 30% and 74% beta sheet, and others  52%-97% alpha helix. interestingly, most interpro-defined repeat domains are > <dig> amino acids long and form non-globular elongated structures. structure-based functionality of these repeated domains has been illustrated for tetratricopeptide   <cit>  and spectrin  <cit> . specifically, some repeats serve as building blocks in superstructure and thus steric constraints limit the expansion of the repeated units  <cit> .

the parameters used in this study for identification of tr-proteins in n. vectensis excluded most of the pfam domains  <cit> . however, overall, the pfam-defined repeated domains from n. vectensis exhibit a copy number similar to their mammalian counterparts . at present, the validated number of repeated tr elements in n. vectensis cannot be determined. we expect a fraction of them to be eliminated following an exhaustive transcriptomic study. on the other hand, trs with low sequence identity  were not considered in our study.

currently, functional information for n. vectensis  is very limited. annotations that appears in > <dig> proteins are sparse and include 'zinc ion binding' , 'g-protein coupled receptor protein signaling' , and 'calcium binding' . while the overlap of n. vectensis tr-units with tr-units from hydra is rather limited , about  <dig> of the tr-units are shared only among cnidaria representatives and are not detected in human or mouse .

evolution dynamics - expansion and deletion of repeated units
representative genomes from porifera  have provided molecular information on the evolutionarily oldest, yet still extant, phylum. analysis of the genomes of demospongiae , calcarea , and hexactinellida  revealed an increase in gene number due to a burst of gene duplication events. this process was accompanied by efficient domain shuffling. this gave rise to the evolution of new domains  and elements of adaptive immunity  <cit> .

we have shown that the expansion and contraction of repeats carries the potential for an increase in functional variability. the large numbers of tr-segments and additional repeated units in n. vectensis proteome may have an impact on the fitness of nematostella to cope with the environment. we noted a wide variation in the extent of repeats throughout the evolutionary tree . repeat expansion has shaped many families of proteins . the mechanism that underlies the gain and loss of trs  is most likely a non-reciprocal mode of recombination and gene conversion. over evolutionary time, gene conversion within repeated sequences has been an important mode in shaping eukaryotic genomes  <cit> . it is likely that most tr-units in the representative organisms studied  have evolved independently. the tr-proteins that are shared between human, mouse, hydra, sponge, choanoflagellate, and sea anemone genomes serve as a basis to study the process of their evolution. exciting examples for the importance of the actual numbers of tr-units within coding sequences are known from yeast to human  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the proteome of nematostella vectensis is uniquely characterized in terms of its tandemly repeated amino acid sequences. about  <dig> tr-units from n. vectensis were identified, a number that exceeds all other multicellular organisms tested. comparing tr-proteins to additional representatives of metazoan origin substantiated the uniqueness of the phenomenon in n. vectensis but also confirmed that tr-units are in general less conserved even among closely related organisms . we suggest that the tr-proteins present in early metazoan life may have served as a robust source for novel genes with previously overlooked characteristics. these tr-proteins have unique properties in term of amino acid composition, structural properties, and evolutionary dynamics. as such, they may have unexpectedly functioned as a distinctive and rich origin for gene novelty within the framework of animal evolution.
