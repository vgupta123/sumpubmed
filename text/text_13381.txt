BACKGROUND
avian pathogenic escherichia coli , a subgroup of extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli  causes avian colibacillosis and imposes economic losses on the poultry industry worldwide  <cit> . however, the pathogenesis of apec is poorly understood. many virulence genes have been studied to identify virulence factors in apec, including those involved in adhesion, iron-regulation, toxin/cytotoxin production and serum resistance  <cit> . iron is an essential element involved in important biological processes  <cit> . biological activities in cells, such as peroxide reduction, nucleotide biosynthesis and electron transport, are facilitated by iron ions  <cit> . extra-intestinal sites have low iron contents; therefore, expec strains struggle to take up iron from the host during infection  <cit> . during natural infection, the initiation, progression and transmission of most bacterial infections depend on the ability of the invading pathogen to acquire iron from the complicated environment  <cit> . during iron acquisition, the cell must produce transmembrane receptors for siderophores that chelate iron ions  <cit> . there are various receptors that chelate iron ions encoded by bacterial genes, such as chua, the sitabcd system, iron, iha, iuta, and irea. outer membrane protein chua participates in heme acquisition in enterohemorrhagic e. coli and uropathogenic e. coli  strains, and is important for the pathogenicity of apec  <cit> . the sitabcd system, identified in the apec strain mt <dig> by comparative genomic analysis, was reported to be associated with the pathogenicity of apec  <cit> .

irea was suggested to be involved in fe acquisition and to act as an iron-regulated virulence gene in the blood- or urine-derived expec e. coli isolated from humans  <cit> ; however, its exact role in apec strains remains unknown. herein, an irea deletion mutant was constructed to study the irea gene function in the apec strain de205b.

discussion
the irea gene is an iron-regulated gene and is involved in iron acquisition in human pathogenic e. coli isolates and our study proved this protein functions in apec. additionally, we identified two new functions of irea using the deletion mutant. in the present study, irea was demonstrated to contribute to the adhesion to df- <dig> cells. moreover, the expressions of several adhesion genes were tested and the results showed no significant differences between wild-type and mutant strain, indicating that the irea gene indeed plays a role in adhesion. tarr et al., identified adhesin iha from an o157:h <dig> strain of e. coli  <cit> . this adhesin shared high similarities with several identified or putative siderophore receptors. siderophore receptor irga was reported to contribute to growth in the rabbit ileal loop model in vivo and to enhance virulence in an infant mouse model, suggesting a possible role in colonization  <cit> . here, we proved that iron-regulated gene irea plays a role in the adhesion of apec strains. the irea gene also increased stress-resistance under alkali and high osmolarity conditions, as well as underlow temperature. thus, the redundancy of siderophore receptors might reflect their multifunctional roles.

e. coli strains were reported to be classified into four main phylogenetic groups   <cit> . virulent expec strains mainly belong to phylogroup b <dig> and d, whereas most commensal strains belong to phylogroup a  <cit> . the irea gene was distributed more frequently in the b <dig>  and d  groups than in the a  and b <dig>  groups, indicating that irea might be associated with the virulence of the apec strain de205b. thus, the result correlated with that russo’s report: irea was detected in  <dig>  of  <dig> random clinical isolates from patients and in none  of  <dig> fecal isolates, which presumably represented commensal strains  <cit> . taken together, these results indicated that irea might be a virulence gene in both human and avian expec e. coli strains.

the expression level of irea in de205b was decreased in high fe m <dig> media compared with that in low fe media, indicating that irea is involved in iron-regulation in this apec strain. this result agreed with the report of russo et al., who found that irea was a iron-regulated virulence gene in the blood- or urine-derived isolates of expec e. coli  <cit> . most ferric uptake genes, such as fepc, feob, chut, fyua and fepa were upregulated in the irea deletion mutant strain. this might represent a compensatory function for irea gene deletion. fe acquisition is important for many microorganisms, especially for pathogens that grow in the host, which attempts to limit fe availability. it is thought that pathogens harbor multiple fe acquisition systems to ensure that fe is gained from the host cells to provide a selective advantage. alternatively, certain siderophores, and their cognate receptors, might be more active in certain environments, such as inside or outside the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . moreover, multiple systems might represent ‘alternatives’ that protect against the disruption of one system caused by genomic rearrangements or mutations.

in the duck infection experiments, the ld <dig> showed no significant difference between the wild-type de205b and the irea deletion mutant strain. thus, it seemed that irea deletion had no obvious effect on the virulence of de205b. however, de205b has several fe acquisition systems. we showed that most of the other fe acquisition genes were upregulated in the irea gene deletion mutant. thus, the irea gene might indeed contribute to the virulence of the apec strain de205b, while other fe acquisition genes displayed compensatory functions when the irea gene was deleted.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the irea gene was mainly distributed in the more virulent phylogenetic ecor group b and d. compared with the wild-type strain, the adhesion and resistance to environmental stress of the irea deletion mutant were significant decreased. this indicated that irea is a fe iron-regulated gene that aids adhesion and stress-resistance in the apec strain de205b.
