BACKGROUND
the systematic classification of bacteria has been a long-standing problem because very limited morphological features are available. for a long time researchers could only group together similar bacteria for practical determinative needs  <cit> . woese and collaborators initiated molecular phylogeny of prokaryotes by making use of the small subunit  ribosomal rna  sequences  <cit> . the ssu-rrna trees  <cit>  have been considered as the standard tree of life by many biologists.

attempts to explicate the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on the ssu-rrna have been by-and-large successful  <cit> . however, although such molecules have proved to be very useful phylogenetic markers, mutational saturation is a problem due to the restricted length and limited number of mutation sites  <cit> . another well-known problem is that phylogenetic trees, constructed on single gene families may show conflicts  <cit>  due to a variety of causes, such as lgt   <cit> , hybridization, lineage-sorting, paralogous genes  <cit> , and pseudogenes  <cit> . with the increasing availability of whole genome sequences, methods using vast amounts of phylogenetic information contained in complete genome sequences are becoming more and more important for inferring species phylogenies. because phylogenetic information extracted from whole genomes is based on the maximum genetic information, the resulting phylogenetic tree should be the best reflection of the evolutionary history of the species, assuming this history is tree-like  <cit> . phylogenomics, i.e. using entire genomes to infer a species tree, represents the state of art for reconstructing phylogenies  <cit> .

a relatively obvious approach to phylogenetic analysis of whole genomes uses multiple sequence alignments with certain evolutionary models  <cit> . however, the multiple sequence alignment strategy may not work for whole genomes and the evolutionary models may not always be applicable. multiple sequence alignment could be misleading due to gene rearrangements, inversion, transposition and translocation at the genome level  <cit> , unequal lengths of sequences, lgt, etc. on the other hand, reliable statistical evolution models are yet to be suggested for complete genomes.

to address these issues, sankoff and blanchette  <cit>  defined an evolutionary edit distance as the number of inversions, transpositions and deletions/insertions required to change the gene order from one genome into another. similar distance measures using rearrangement, recombination, breakpoint, comparative mapping and gene order have been extensively studied for whole genome phylogeny  <cit> . these approaches are computationally expensive, and in general do not produce correct results on events such as non-contiguous copies of a gene on the genome or non-decisive gene order.

gene content was proposed as distance measure in whole genome phylogeny where "the similarity between two species is defined as the number of genes they have in common divided by their total number of genes"  <cit> . this idea was further extended to use lists of nucleotide segment pairs in comparison instead of lists of genes  <cit> . such method fails when the gene contents of organisms are very similar, such as bacteria in closely related families, or chimerical genomes.

overlapping gene information was also used to infer the genome phylogenies  <cit> . overlapping genes are defined as pairs of adjacent genes of which the coding sequences overlap partly or entirely. although overlapping genes have been shown to be a consistent and conserved feature across all microbial genomes sequenced to date  <cit> , the limited amount of overlapping genes is usually not enough for evaluating a large number of genomes.

some other methods infer phylogenies based on protein structural domain information  <cit> , which considers lgt. however, they assume some proteome evolution models with lateral structural domain transfer events, which may not be accurate. also, the method readjusts the protein structural domain graph each time when a lgt event is introduced, the complexity of model testing increases substantially when large number of lateral structural domain transfer events been assumed.

in this paper, we introduce a new tool 'comphy', which utilizes a robust and much less complex strategy, called 'gene composite distance'. it combines different aspects of evolutionary relationships among genomes to produce a phylogenetic tree from a given set of whole genome sequences. we have applied this approach to  <dig> prokaryotic genomes, which were downloaded from ncbi  <cit> . more precisely, composite distance measure starts with an all-against-all pairwise genome comparison using blastp  <cit> . in the second step, a distance matrix is calculated from three components, i.e., gdd , gbd  and gcd . this distance matrix is then fed to a distance-based algorithm, neighbor-joining   <cit> , using a third-party tool 'phylip'  <cit>  to produce a phylogenetic tree. in our current study, we do not consider lgt. our goal is to have mathematically tractability and to develop a generalized phylogenetic distance model and a phylogenetic tree construction platform that can be easily applied to any species. furthermore, using the completely sequenced genomes allows the construction of a phylogeny less sensitive to inconsistencies, such as lgt, unrecognized paralogy, and highly variable rates of evolution among different regions in a genome. the result phylogenetic trees are more representative of whole-genomes than those from single-gene trees.

methods
taxon selection
 <dig> single-chromosome prokaryotic genome protein sequences were downloaded in the fasta format from the ncbi  <cit>  ftp server in september  <dig>  the physical gene location files of these genomes were also downloaded from ncbi in a tab-delimited format. we represent the species biological names as defined in bergey's code  <cit> . for example, a lineage in the bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology or its online outline is abbreviated as b <dig> . <dig> . <dig> = phylum bxiii , class iii , order ii , family vi , genus ii . table  <dig> shows the taxon statistics of the  <dig> prokaryotic genomes, including  <dig> multi-chromosomal species that we do not consider in this paper.

p = phylum, c = class, o = order, f = family, g = genus, s = species, str = strain. a = archaea and b = bacteria.

in order to test the performance of our method,  <dig> datasets with different combinations of the whole  <dig> genomes are formed for different purposes. dataset  <dig> is formed by  <dig> randomly selected species from the bergey's taxonomy tree to test for robustness. we like to test the performance of our method on this broad range of species. dataset  <dig> has  <dig> species, half of them are randomly picked from archaea genomes  and half are randomly picked from baceteria genomes . these  <dig> species from two major clades have a clear taxonomy structure with two clusters. dataset  <dig> has  <dig> species, half of them are from phylum b <dig> since half of  <dig> genomes are actually from b <dig> phylum, and the other half is randomly selected from all the other types of genomes, i.e., half of them have a tight cluster and the other half are diverse. dataset  <dig> includes all the  <dig> single chromosome genomes. since many prokaryotes are from phylum b <dig> and phylum b <dig>  therefore, we form datasets  <dig> and  <dig> from all the  <dig> phylum b <dig> genomes and  <dig> phylum b <dig> genomes, respectively, to test for the effects of the co-linearity of datasets on phylogeny construction. dataset  <dig> is a union of datasets  <dig> and  <dig>  again with two tight clusters of species. dataset  <dig> has  <dig> prokaryotic species obtained from bphyog  <cit>  in order to compare the performance between our method and the overlapping gene based phylogeny used by bphyog. dataset  <dig>  with  <dig> prokaryotic species was obtained from deeds  <cit>  for comparing performance between our method and the structural domain based phylogeny construction. both dataset  <dig> or  <dig> contain a subset of the  <dig> complete prokaryotic data. we believe these  <dig> diverse datasets allow us to test the robustness of our method comprehensively.

identification of orthologs
the initial step in the phylogenetic analysis methods is to determine which genes are to be compared between species. since the ultimate goal is determining the distance between every two genomes, intuitively we use pairwise orthology for every pair of genomes. so far there is no existing database containing the orthologous groups for all the genomes that we are studying.

here, we define orthologs by performing an all-against-all blast between every pair of protein sequences for each pair of species. the reciprocal best blast hits are used to determine the list of orthologs between every pair of species. additional filtering methods have also been applied to refine the list of orthologs between the pair of genomes, such as pairs of genes to be considered orthologs must satisfy blast hit with e-values below 10- <dig> and sequence identity higher than 30%. the tests of variations of ortholog definition will be shown in the result and discussion section. in comphy, we also give the users the flexibility to apply their definitions of orthologs.

composite distance phylogeny
this strategy is to compute a distance between any two genomes x and y based on the set of orthologs obtained in the previous step. this new systematic composite distance measurement takes into account both similarities and dissimilarities between every pair of genomes using their entire gene sets. comphy utilizes this composite distance formulation to determine the phylogeny for given genomes. the formulation will be discussed in three separated calculation steps, gdd, 'gene dispersion distance', gbd, 'genome breakpoint distance' and gcd, 'gene content distance'.

gdd 
the first component, gdd, is to quantify the extent of dispersion of orthologs from one genome to another. our assumption is that the closer the two species in the evolutionary tree, the more similar the physical arrangements of corresponding orthologs are. the dispersion of orthologs from one genome to another can be seen as how far orthologs move away from their physical locations during evolution due to events such as rearrangement, recombination, insertion and deletion. the further the evolution distance of the two species, the more dispersed the orthologs between two species are. in other words, the distance separations of pairs of orthologs are more conserved between a pair of closely related genomes. to simplify the problem, we consider only pairs of orthologs that are right next to each other. the gene dispersion distance of an ortholog pair from genome a to genome b can be then formulated as

  dgdd=∑li,i+1n <dig> 

where li, i+ <dig> is the distance separation between the i-th ortholog and the -th ortholog of genome b in genome a. for example, if orthologs bi and bi+ <dig> are next to each other on genome b, but their corresponding orthologs ax and ay in genome a are l orthologs apart , then the distance between this ortholog pair is l. n is number of orthologs between genomes a and b, which is the maximum dispersion distance. for normalization, one n is needed to normalize the size of a genome or the total number of orthologs . another n is to normalize the dispersion distance against the maximum distance between two orthologs, which is n also. thus, n <dig> is needed for normalization. in fact, the normalization factors, such as n, n <dig>  and n <dig>  have been tested to see performances. our study has shown that using n <dig> as the normalization factor, in terms of range of dispersion distance and number of shared orthologs, has the optimal results.

note, the gene dispersions, from a to b and from b to a, are not necessarily symmetric. we can define the dispersion distance measure in three different ways, namely, we can use the average d = / <dig> or use one of the two directions, either d = d or d = d. our study indicates that this directionality does have some impact on the overall performance and averaging over both directions produces better and more consistent results. thus, the dispersion distance between genome a and b is defined as

  d = / <dig> 

we will also use a real example of three bacterial species, pyrobaculum aerophilum str. im <dig> , pyrobaculum islandicum dsm  <dig> , and thermus thermophilus hb <dig>  as an example to show the gene dispersion distance idea. by putting the dispersion distances of ortholog pairs, between p. aerophilum and p. islandicum and between p. aerophilum and t. thermophilus, in different distance bins, figure  <dig> demonstrates the conservation of the dispersion distance of ortholog pairs between closely related species. p. aerophilum and p. islandicum, both belong to thermoproteaceae family in thermoprotei order, so in the figure the black bins show uneven distribution of frequencies and most dispersion distances are falling into the smallest distance bin. this result agrees with the experimental finding that these two species are highly similar in terms of contents of genes and overall genome organization  <cit> . in contrast, t. thermophilus is a member of thermaceae family in deinococci order, as a result the white bins show more evenly distributes of dispersion distances among distance bins.

gbd 
this distance transformation is based on the concept of breakpoints, where two sequence segments map consecutive intervals in one genome onto non-consecutive intervals in the other  <cit> . we simplified it by considering a breakpoint as where two ortholog sets map consecutively in one genome but not in the other. in other words, a breakpoint defined here is where the consecutive mapping of a set of orthologs between two genomes stops. figure  <dig> gives a hypothetical example. there are two separated sets of consecutive orthologous genes and they are  and , the consecutive mapping between genome a and b stops at positions a2a <dig>  a6a <dig> and a10a <dig> in genome b. therefore, there would be three breakpoints between genome a and genome b. let xab be the number of breakpoints between genome a and genome b, and nab be the total number of orthologs between genome a and genome b. we then define a breakpoint similarity between a and b as

  dgbd=1−xabnab 

using figure  <dig> as an example, there are  <dig> breakpoints and there are  <dig> orthologs, and hence, dgbd is 1–3/ <dig> =  <dig> .

gcd 
the last component of composite distance is calculated using the idea of gene content  <cit>  to show the similarity between two genomes. here, we define the distance as

  dgcd=1/ 

where nc is the number of orthologs between x genome and y genome, nx is the number of genes in genome x, and ny is the number of genes in genome y.

composite distance formulation
the composite distance used in this paper for genome distance calculation has three distance components described above, where they represent three different aspects of genomes. gdd describes conservation of relative physical separation distances of orthologs, where this conservation can be thought as evolution timestamps. gbd utilizes the ordering of genes between a pair of genomes. although it has some correlation with the first component, gbd reflects more local synteny  instead of large-scale genome rearrangement characterized by gdd. gcd shows the level of similarity shared from genome composition without considering gene locations. it acts as an adjustment for different sizes of genomes, which could be thought as a normalization factor. preliminary experiments showed that they are all very informative . therefore, the composite distance is defined as following:

gdd = gene dispersion distance, gcd = gene content distance, gbd = gene breakpoint distance. gcd*gdd is the combination of two distance components and gcd*gdd*gbd is the combination of all three terms. all distances are logarithmically transformed.

  d = logdgdd + logdgbd + logdgcd 

we apply logarithm to the formula for retaining precision of computing and correcting the saturation effects in sequence data  <cit> . by considering the three distances, we generalize the conservation of gene order into an accurate and robust measurement.

other genome distance measures
to compare with methods developed by other researchers, we also implemented several other distance measures for phylogenetic analysis.

 overlapping gene phylogenetic distance
overlapping genes   <cit>  are defined as pairs of adjacent genes of which the coding sequences overlap partly or entirely. the distance between genomes i and j is defined as:

  dij=1−xij+xji2*min⁡ 

where xi is the number of og pairs in genome i and xij is the number of og pairs in genome i that have their respective orthologs in genome j, and vice versa for other subscripts.

 structural domain phylogenetic distance
the structural domain based distance method  <cit>  uses the idea of protein domain universe graph , a graph in which a nonredundant set of all known protein structural domains  <cit>  are represented as nodes, and the structural similarity between domains is used to define edges between them. the distribution of edges per node in the graph was shown markedly different from random graph  <cit> . by combining with information of probability of lgt events, a similarity distance between species could be constructed. for example, degree distribution is calculated by comparing domain graph against known pdug as follows:

  pn=∑s=kmaxkn0s−k 

where maxkn <dig> is the degree of the maximally connected node in the underlying graph  with n <dig> nodes and a species graph with n nodes.

lgt is modeled as the movement of a node from a proteome in which that node exists into a proteome in which it does not. a transfer does not remove the node from the “donor” organism, but it may replace  one of the nodes in the acceptor organism to preserve the proteome size. the donor and acceptor organisms are chosen randomly, and the transferred node is chosen randomly from the set of nodes in the donor proteome that do not exist in the acceptor proteome. the acceptor node that is replaced is also chosen at random.

 ccv/cv-based phylogenetic distance
gao et al.  <cit>  used all the string appearance frequencies  to represent each genome, that is, each whole genome can be regarded as a high-dimension vector, where each vector component is the frequency of a particular combination of nucleotides . then the pairwise distance between two genomes can be calculated as the euclidean distance between the corresponding two vectors. wu et al.  <cit>  extended this idea to use all the string appearance frequencies to define a ccv-based phylogenetic distance. in this distance, strings of length from  <dig> to k are all employed.

phylogenetic inference
all of methods mentioned above, including composite distance method, were used to generate a distance matrix between all pairs of genomes. phylogenetic trees were then generated using the neighbor-joining  <cit>  algorithm in phylip   <cit>  .

performance measurement
there is no official standard for prokaryotic taxonomy. however, it is widely believed by microbiologists that the classification scheme in bergey's manual of systematic bacteriology  <cit>  is the best approximation available. to measure the performances of a distance method, we calculated the percentage of agreed quartet topologies between the tree created by the method and the tree from the bergey's taxonomy. a quartet topology is a subtree structure of the subset of  <dig> taxa . given a quartet of taxa, a, b, c, and d, there are  <dig> possible ways to connect the taxa as terminals . note that, the tree from bergey's taxonomy is not a binary tree; therefore, one node may have more than two children. as a result, some of the quartets do not have any of the three quartet topologies in figure  <dig>  we call a quartet is resolved if no more than three of taxa share the same parents. to measure the performance of our method, we will collect agreed quartets in which the quartets have the same topology between the tree from bergey's taxonomy and a binary phylogenetic tree. the accuracy is percentage of the agreed quartets.

RESULTS
variance of orthlog definition
to test the robustness of our ortholog definition, different variations of e-value cut-offs and sequence identities have been selected for performance evaluation. our results showed that e-value cut-offs lower than 10- <dig> do not have significant effects on the results. this is probably because the reciprocal blast hit process would ensure the majority of the homolog selections as long as e-values are small enough. however, different selections of percentage identities have some impacts on the performance. a very high percentage identity would be too stringent to obtain enough number of orthologs, while a very low percentage identity would have too many false positive ortholog pairs. we used dataset  <dig> as representative dataset, described in the method section, for testing orthologs selection with e-value below 10– <dig> and percentage identities of 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. accuracies of 76%, 82%, 89% and 85% were obtained using gdd method, respectively. therefore, we selected the e-value cut-off at 10– <dig> and percentage identity of 30% for the optimal ortholog definition.

comparison to single gene trees
although attempts to explain the phylogeny of prokaryotes based on the ssu-rrna have been quite successful  <cit> , a well-known problem associated with this type of single-gene approach is that the evolutionary history of any single gene may differ from the phylogenetic history of the whole organism from which the corresponding molecule was isolated. we were able to obtain single-gene phylogenetic trees of  <dig> bacterial species  <cit>  for comparing with our method. figure  <dig> shows three different trees based on single-gene selection and one tree based on the whole-genome gene sets using our method. using the accuracy measurement described in the method section, accuracies of 88%, 81% and 83% are obtained for tree ,  and , respectively, while tree  based on the whole-genome gene sets has a significantly higher accuracy of 91%. as an example, in tree  and , salinnibacter rubber, which is a member of bacteroidetes , is placed outside its own phylum towards the protebacteria phylum . in tree , rhodopirellula baltica is placed closer to phyla bacteroidetes  and chlorobi , which is correct  <cit> . huerta-cepas et al.  <cit>  found degrees of topological variations among single-gene phylogenies were much greater than previously thought. their conclusions, although based on eukaryotes, may be applicable to the whole tree of life, and are probably even more important to the prokaryote phylogeny given more lgts in prokaryotes.

composite distance as optimal distance measurement
we used  <dig> datasets, described in the method section, for performance evaluations. in comparison to several other phylogenetic analysis methods, our composite distance method showed consistently better performance . we have achieved above 90% accuracy comparing to bergey's taxonomy system for all the selected datasets.

gcd = gene content distance, og = overlapping gene distance, sdd = structural domain distance.

results from tables  <dig> and  <dig> suggest the optimal distance calculation is the composite distance, which combines the advantages of gdd, gcd and gbd. we use dataset  <dig> by deeds  <cit>  for detailed discussion. dataset  <dig> consists of  <dig> archaea  species,  <dig> bacteria aquificae  species,  <dig> bacteria thermotogae  species,  <dig> bacteria cyanobacteria  species,  <dig> bacteria proteobacteria  species,  <dig> bacteria firmicutes  species,  <dig> bacteria actinobacteria  species, and  <dig> bacteria fusobacteria  species. in this dataset, thermotoga maritima , a rod-shaped bacterium belongs to the order thermotogales, contains  <dig>  predicted coding regions, but it has only about  <dig> genes that have orthologs in the genomes of other thermophilic eubacteria and archaea. completion of its genome has revealed a high degree of similarity with archaea in terms of contents of genes and overall genome organization, where almost one quarter of the genome is archaea in nature, instead of other bacterial phylum. conservation of gene order between t. maritima and the archaea species in many of the clustered regions suggests that lgt may have occurred between thermophilic eubacteria and archaea  <cit> . when classifying this species, our composite distance method moves t. maritima closer to the archaea clade on the tree, which reflects this biological property. in contrast, other methods, such as ccv method and overlapping gene method, put t. maritima closer to either the proteobacteria  clade or the firmicutes  clade on the phylogenetic tree. out of these three methods that do not model lgt events specifically, the composite distance method still demonstrates good sensitivity of the proposed composite distance method.

by comparing different trees generated from different distance measures, we found that gdd and gbd are more sensitive on deeper-lever of the trees. however, gcd is more accurate on higher levels, such as clades of the tree. for example, the gene content method puts five species of diplococci  of fiemicutes  together with its neighboring class bacilli of fiemicutes, while gdd mis-classifies those five species as members of the proteobactria  clade. as we can see from table  <dig>  by combining all three distance components together as the composite distance measure, the advantages of individual components are also combined together to achieve the optimal results. other methods, such as structural domain method, position archaea at a higher level phylum than bacteria phylum on the phylogeny tree, which contradicts the taxonomy where they are at the parallel levels on the tree. in contrast, our composite distance method is consistent with the taxonomy. a possible reason could be the consideration of lgt events, as the structural domain method overly emphasizes the role of lgt genes from archaea to bacteria. the overlapping gene method however, has problem of using limited information to estimate the distance. overlapping genes are conserved, but they represent a small number of genes in the genome and hence, the statistical errors may be large. this is shown by mis-classifying pyrococcus furiosus  into clade of bacilli , instead of archaea  using the overlapping gene method.

it is interesting to note that gbd method by itself performed poorly for large-scale comparison of prokaryote genomes, which is in accordance with the commonly held view that breakpoint methods lead to reliable results only if the genomes are sufficiently co-linear, such as in datasets  <dig> and  <dig> 

efficiency comparison
besides comparing the accuracies of different distance measures, we also consider computational efficiency. most whole-genome phylogeny construction methods, including ours, require a process of defining orthologs through time-consuming blast. assuming there are m genomes and each genome has roughly ~n orthologs, then the complexity for reciprocal blast hits in ortholog identifications would be o. excluding this process, our method, which computes in linear time, takes much less computing time than other methods, especially the breakpoint distance measure  <cit> . structural domain method, in another way, considers lgt events. it approximates the genome distance by continuously readjusting the protein structural domain graph when applying each lgt event , and the running time could easily take up to hours if not days for a large genome data set. the ccv method, although not requiring a process of defining orthologs, considers every possible string of length up to k for whole genome sequences. this method requires even higher computational resources in terms of memory and cpu cycles. overall, the composite distance measure shows not only the higher accuracy but also fast speed.

further discussion
given pairs of prokaryotic species, there could be situations where one genome is essentially a subset of another much larger genome. for example, in our datasets this is true of buchnera aphidicola genome, which is essentially a subset of the escherichia coli genome, with approximately 14% the size of it  <cit> . shared genome sequences could make two different genomes seem to be more closely related than they actually are. we have tried to model this case by modifying the gcd formula since this method uses all the genes in genome pair as normalization factor, not just the orthologs. we used the smaller genome gene set size instead of summing two genome gene set sizes for normalization. this modified formula would consider the similar segments of genome at most once. however, the performance of this modified gcd formula decreased significantly from around 85% to 60% for most of the datasets. given that the situation where one genome is part of another genome is rare, it appears that considering this in our distance calculation lost the generality of the method.

although all our trees would be generated as binary trees, or phylograms, with two leaf species for each node and they are hard to compare to the taxonomy, which is usually not binary, we find our results are consistent with most of the taxonomy in bergey's system based on the percentage of agreed quartet topologies. nevertheless, we still mis-classify some species on the tree. for example, treponema pallidum in class spirochaetes  is placed as a sib of the class phylum diplococci , which does not agree with current classifications. this may be because the genome t. pallidum has high number of lgts, which is as high as  <dig> %  <cit> . it would be hard for the current method to deal with such an extreme. other cases, such as chimerical genomes  <cit>  or paralogous genes, are not modeled in this study, but could have misleading effects on our classifications. chimeric genomes, which could have happened due to lgt, would produce false lineage for the interested genomes. paralogous genes would artificially shorten the distance between two genomes if there are many paralogs. future developments of the tool would include events of lgt, gene copy number, and conservation of overlapping genes, as well as exclude genes with abnormal evolution rates. we can see that comphy provides a framework for incorporating more relevant biological aspects for distance measurement.

CONCLUSIONS
comphy, a stand-alone phylogeny construction tool, provides a robust and easy-to-use tool for biologists. it does not require multiple sequence alignment and is fully automated. comphy implements a composite distance method, which does not depend on any type of evolution models in calculating the distance between two genomes besides the protein sequences and gene physical locations. it allows users to infer phylogenies for any set of genomes of interest to study their evolutionary relationships by either generating a phylogram tree or a newick format tree file for further study. although the tool is built for complete-genome gene sets phylogeny, users can provide pre-defined ortholog sets to build the phylogeny according their criteria. the process takes less than a minute from given protein sequence files and protein location files to the outputs of trees for hundreds of species if excluding the blastp for generating orthologs. although in the current stage of the application, our method works only for species with single chromosome, we will extend comphy to study eukaryotic genomes with improved methods working on multi-chromosomes. we believe this is a timely development as the whole-genome phylogeny becomes dominant with the arrival of more complete genome sequences, especially from the meta-genomic analyses of microbial communities  <cit> .
