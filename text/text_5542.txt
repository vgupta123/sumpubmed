BACKGROUND
the transcription factor oct <dig>  known also as oct <dig> and oct3/ <dig>  belongs to class v of the pou  transcription factor family. the pou family includes transcription factors containing the pou domain and regulating transcription via binding to an octamer motif located in the promoter or enhancer regions of target genes  <cit> .

an important role of oct <dig> factor in sustaining pluripotency of preimplantation embryonic cells and mouse embryonic stem cells  has been convincingly demonstrated using the directed mutagenesis and rna interference  <cit> . embryos homozygous for oct <dig> gene mutation die during implantation because of the inability to form the inner cell mass  of the blastocyst  <cit> . suppression of oct <dig> expression in es cells by rna interference induces cell differentiation into trophectodermal derivatives  <cit> .

the mouse, human, and bovine oct <dig> orthologs have a highly conserved nucleotide sequence and genomic organization  <cit> .

oct <dig> gene expression in preimplantation mouse embryo is confined exclusively to pluripotent icm cells  <cit> . after the implantation, oct <dig> expression in somatic tissues reduces and remains only in primordial germ cells. in addition, expression of oct <dig> is characteristic of embryonic stem  cell lines, embryonic carcinoma  cells, and embryonic germ  cell lines  <cit> . unlike mouse, the oct <dig> expression in human, cattle, and swine preimplantation embryos is not restricted to icm, but is also observed in trophectoderm cells  <cit> .

oct <dig> expression is regulated at the transcriptional level by cis-regulatory elements located in the 5' region of the gene  <cit> . analysis of lacz reporter gene expression, controlled by a fragment of the mouse oct <dig> genomic locus, revealed two elements essential for regulating the cell-specific expression of oct <dig> gene. these elements were named as proximal and distal enhancers. the studies have shown that distal enhancer is active in icm, es, eg and primordial germ cells, whereas the proximal enhancer is needed to activate oct <dig> gene in embryonic ectoderm and mouse ec cells  <cit> . so far the structure, expression and regulation of the oct <dig> gene have been studied comprehensively in mouse, human, and cattle  <cit> . in this work, a genomic copy and cdna of the vole oct <dig> gene were isolated and cloned as well as its exon-intron structure and expression were studied. nucleotide sequences of the coding and regulatory regions of vole oct <dig> gene were compared to the corresponding sequences of six mammalian species, including mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, cattle, and dog. use of luciferase reporter constructs allowed demonstrated that individual elements of the regulatory region of vole oct <dig> gene were functionally active in mouse pluripotent cells. this fact suggests a high conservation of the system regulating this gene in mammals. a comprehensive study of the genes involved in maintaining pluripotency such as oct <dig> in voles will make it possible to obtain new information about the species-specific features of their structure, expression, and regulation, and thereby enhancing optimization of the experiments on obtaining of vole es cells.

RESULTS
nucleotide sequence, exon-intron structure, and expression of m. rossiaemeridionalis oct <dig> gene
clone containing genomic sequence of vole oct <dig> was isolated via screening of the m. rossiaemeridionalis genomic phage library. overall,  <dig> bp were identified, where five exons and the regulatory region of oct <dig> gene were conditionally mapped based on the homology to mouse oct <dig> gene sequence. the coding region contains no stop codons, and canonical splice sites are present at the putative exon-intron boundaries. the minimal promoter, as well as proximal and distal enhancers were identified within the regulatory region on the basis of comparative sequence analysis. repeated dna sequences were found in introns and in the 5' and 3' regions. these repeats are represented mainly by sine elements . the sequences located 3' to exon  <dig> of vole oct <dig> gene, which were sequenced only partially, displayed a similarity to the major histocompatibility complex.

to verify the exon-intron structure of vole oct <dig> gene, 3'- and 5'-race experiments were performed. preimplantation embryos of m. rossiaemeridionalis were used as a source of rna. comparison of cdna clones obtained by race with the genomic sequence confirmed that vole oct <dig> gene contained five exons corresponding to the oct <dig> exons of other mammalian species studied . the splicing sites of vole oct <dig> gene transcript are conserved and follow the gt/ag rule. the detected transcript is  <dig> nt long and encodes for a protein with a length of  <dig> aa. the 5' utr is  <dig> bp long; 3' utr,  <dig> bp. relative to mouse, the transcription start site of vole oct <dig> is located  <dig> bp farther upstream falling within an 8-bp insertion, specific to the vole minimal promoter. the polyadenylation signal of vole oct <dig> has a species-specific sequence; the 3' boundary of the gene is located  <dig> bp upstream of the mouse gene. in all investigated samples, 2-cell embryos, morulas, blastocysts, primordial gonads of postimplantation embryos on day 8–17dpc, adult organs , cultures of r <dig> trophoblast stem cells and extraembryonic endoderm cells no products of alternative splicing were found for vole oct <dig> gene.

3'-race allowed us to detect the expression of vole oct <dig> gene during preimplantation development at the morula and blastocyst stages  and in genital ridges of postimplantation stages from  <dig> dpc up to  <dig> dpc . transcription of oct <dig> gene was undetectable in the organs of adult voles , trophoblast stem cells, and extraembryonic endoderm cells .

analysis of the activity of vole oct <dig> promoter
to analyse the role of putative regulatory elements of vole oct <dig> gene, we have used a luciferase reporter assay . pluripotent es cell lines have not been derived for vole species, therefore we transiently transfected luciferase reporter vectors containing various elements of vole oct <dig> putative regulatory region into mouse es cell line tg-2a, mouse ec cells p <dig>  and vole trophoblast stem cells r <dig>  an empty vector pgl2-basic has been used as a negative control. in pluripotent mouse tg-2a cells, pdeh <dig> plasmid, containing promoter and both enhancers  in a direct orientation with respect to luciferase gene, displayed the highest luciferase activity, which exceeded the background level  approximately six-fold . similar, if not even more pronounced effect was observed when the same construct was transfected into mouse ec cells. deletion of the distal enhancer  almost completely abolishes the promoter activity in tg-2a cells, however it does not have any effect on the activity in p <dig> ec cells that demonstrate equally high luciferase activity as a complete construct. this observation is in line with the data obtained for mouse which indicate the crucial role of distal enhancer for oct <dig> activity in es cells  <cit> .

deletion of proximal enhancer  or both distal and proximal ehancers  reduce the promoter activity 2– <dig> folds, demonstrating that the vole oct <dig> promoter is capable of promoter activity in pluripotent cells by itself, but at significantly lower level . the lowest activity comparable to the background was observed in the case of constructs pdeh <dig> and pde <dig>  the promoter and proximal enhancer in clone pdeh <dig> were in the opposite orientation to the gene, and this region  was deleted in clone pde <dig>  consistent with the lack of oct <dig> expression in trophoblast cells, no luciferase activity was detected when constructs were transfected into vole ts cell line r <dig>  the data obtained in this experiment indicate that, similar to mouse, vole oct <dig> regulatory elements are necessary for efficient and cell type specific expression of the gene.

comparative sequence analysis
vole oct <dig> nucleotide sequence was aligned with oct <dig> sequences of mouse, rat, human, chimpanzee, cattle, and dog, obtained from genbank . overall nucleotide sequence homology varies between 81%  and 89% , however the homology is much higher for the exons  <dig> and  <dig>  encoding for dna-binding pou domain in all pairs of species compared . the homology is lower  in intronic as well as 5' and 3' utr regions, especially where species-specific mobile elements are localized .

comparison of the oct <dig> amino acid sequences demonstrates relatively high similarity level for the pou-specific domain for all species under study . surprisingly, the highest homology is observed between vole and cattle  and the lowest, between vole and mouse . thus, the homology between the amino acid sequences of pou domain from evolutionarily more distant species  appeared higher as compared to the pairs of evolutionarily related species belonging to the same order . when comparing the total homology of oct <dig> proteins, we found that vole and rat are the most similar . it is of considerable interest that mouse oct <dig> protein demonstrates the least amino acid homology with closely related vole , as well as with all other species studied . such a low similarity between mouse and vole oct <dig> proteins contrasts with much higher nucleotide homology  between oct <dig> genes in these species.

next we compared the regions important for oct <dig> gene regulation and function . previously it was demonstrated that three motifs  represent transcription factor binding sites in mouse es and ec cells  <cit> . treatment of undifferentiated es and ec cells with retinoic acid causes loss of transcription factor binding to these motifs, thereby suppressing oct <dig> gene expression and leading to cell differentiation. therefore we have analysed the conservation of these three motifs as well as several other motifs located in the regulatory region.

the homology between the minimal promoters varies between 83–98% in different mammalian species. in vole and other mammals, the gggggcgggg motif  within the minimal promoter is the most conserved . it is a potential transcription factor binding site for the factors of sp family, partially overlaps the hormone responsive element  , is sensitive to retinoic acid, and is recognized by some nuclear receptors  <cit>  . however, not all the elements of oct <dig> gene basal promoter exhibit similar conservation. the gggtggg motif  is 100% homologous in all the species except for dog. the cccaccc motif  is identical in mouse, cattle, and dog; but it is different in rat, human, and chimpanzee. the gggaggg site  identical in the six species compared but is partially changed in vole, being represented by gggaagg sequence. at a distance of one nucleotide from this site in the vole sequence, another gc-rich site is located, gggcggg ; this site is absent in the sequences of other species .

upstream the basal promoter, the two motifs display a high conservation, namely, ccctccc , which is identical in all species except for dog, and gggaggg . these motifs are located in the distal and proximal enhancers, respectively. in addition, several other gc-rich motifs of cccccc and gggggg types with different levels of homology to the sequences of other species were detected in vole. two overlapping gggaggggtggg sites are located at positions -1176/- <dig> of vole oct <dig> gene regulatory region; the site gggaggg  from this region displays a 100% homology in all the species compared. as for the site gggtggg , it is completely homologous only in vole, rat, and mouse. superposed gggtggggtggg sites are also located at positions -2031/- <dig>  both parts of this superposed site are changed in other species; however, in the site with positions -2026/- <dig>  all the species except for vole contain the substitution of thymine for with adenine. this results on formation of gggaggg site, which is also potentially functional .

five so-called e boxes, having a 5'-canntg-3' consensus and being potential binding sites for transcription factor mash- <dig>  <cit>  were detected in the 5' region of vole oct <dig> gene . the most conserved e box is located at positions -332/- <dig> and -978/- <dig> of the vole oct <dig> gene regulatory region; it retains the consensus in the four species compared . the e box at positions -978/- <dig> is identical to human, chimpanzee, and bovine sequences, but differs in mouse and rat. the e box at positions -479/- <dig> displays a 100% homology to human and chimpanzee sequences and is absent in mouse and rat sequences. potential binding sites for transcription factor pem, with an atta consensus, were detected in the regulatory region of vole oct <dig> gene at positions -665/- <dig>  -1899/- <dig>  -1995/- <dig>  -2254/- <dig>  -2373/- <dig>  and -2541/- <dig>  the atta site located at positions -1995/- <dig> displays an absolute homology in all species; the site at positions -2254/- <dig> shows a 100% homology to human, chimpanzee and bovine sequences; and at positions -2373/- <dig> is identical to the mouse sequence.

in the 5' region of vole oct <dig> gene, an autoregulatory composite site was detected, containing potential binding sites for transcription factors oct <dig>  and sox <dig> . electrophoretic mobility shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that transcription factors oct <dig> and sox <dig> bind directly to the composite oct4/sox <dig> elements in oct <dig> and sox <dig> genes in mouse and human es cells  <cit> . in vole, this site is located at positions -2081/- <dig> and displays a 87–93% homology to the sequences found in regulatory regions of other mammalian species .

the sequences located upstream of the oct <dig> minimal promoter are not conserved; their homology reflects the degree of evolutionary relationship of the species compared. nevertheless, the short sequences corresponding to site 2a of the distal enhancer and sites 1a and 1b of the proximal enhancer are distinctly detectable even in the evolutionally distant species. the homology between vole and the species taken for comparison varies from  <dig> to 94% in the region of site 2a of the distal enhancer; in the region of proximal enhancer site 1a, from  <dig> to 89%; and in the region of proximal enhancer site 1b, from  <dig> to 96% .

discussion
in this work, an ortholog of the vole m. rossiaemeridionalis gene encoding transcription factor oct <dig>  which is involved in sustaining the pluripotent cell state at the early stages of embryogenesis, has been isolated and studied. genomic organization of this gene and its intron-exon structure in vole are identical to those in all previously studied species: it comprises five exons and the regulatory region containing several conserved elements. a tight coupling with the major histocompatibility complex is typical of the vole oct <dig>  as well as of its orthologs in mouse, cattle, and human  <cit> .

comparative analysis of nucleotide sequences and the experiments with transient transfection of oct <dig> gene promoter and its regulatory regions within reporter constructs demonstrate once again the conservation of these sequences and their functions. individual substitutions and insertions in this region detected in the vole oct <dig> do not prevent transcription of this gene in the pluripotent mouse cells. the element that is absolutely necessary for the activity of this gene is the region of minimal promoter ; the other elements cannot provide the transcription by themselves and are only able to modulate its level. moreover, the activation and modulation of transcription depend not only on the presence of certain elements, but also on their correct orientation relative to the transcription start site. in addition, the results obtained demonstrate that oct <dig> regulatory regions function in different types of pluripotent cell. a lower activity of the construct with deleted distal enhancer in tg-2a cells versus p <dig> line cells supports the idea that the distal enhancer is a key element providing a high activity of oct <dig> gene in embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

the comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences of oct <dig> orthologs in seven mammalian species demonstrated a high conservation of the genomic organization, coding region, and the main elements  of oct <dig> gene regulatory region. phylogenetic sequence analysis of the promoter regions showed that the most conserved elements in this region are the sites for transcription factors of sp <dig> family and the hormone-responsive element, which retain high similarity and similar organisartion. in addition, a high homology of gc-rich motifs and autoregulatory oct4/sox <dig> site was observed, whereas the homology of other elements in the regulatory region, in particular, the sites for transcription factors mash- <dig> and pem, is rather limited. this fact may suggest that the gc-rich motifs and autoregulatory oct4/sox <dig> site are the elements that are most essential for the regulation of oct <dig> gene expression.

note that oct <dig> is the most conserved among the genes involved in sustaining the pluripotency. for comparison, the nanog gene of mouse and human shows a 58% similarity on their nucleotide sequence in the gene coding region  <cit> . however, despite the conservation of these sequences, considerable interspecific differences in expression of this gene are detectable in ontogenesis.

expression of this gene in vole is detected at the early preimplantation  stages and also in the genital ridges of postimplantation embryos. presumably, the expression of oct <dig> gene in postimplantation vole embryos depends on its activity in primordial germ cells, the gamete precursors, as was shown also for mouse  <cit> . expression of vole oct <dig> gene is undetectable in the organs of adult animals and somatic cell lines, unlike the human oct <dig>  which is detected in adult tissues  <cit> . the vole oct <dig> transcript shows no alternative variants of splicing, which is characteristic of human  <cit> . since the expression of this gene was not found in the trophoblast stem cell lines and extraembryonic endoderm lines of m. rossiaemeridionalis, this suggests that, at the stage of late blastocyst, this gene in vole, as well as in mouse, is expressed only in epiblast cells. conceivably, the epiblast cells in vole late blastocysts retain the pluripotent state at least up to the start of implantation, which allows expecting a successful obtaining of es cells in this species.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we cloned, sequenced and an alysed vole ortholog of oct <dig> gene. a special attention was focused on studying the regulatory region of oct <dig> gene using reporter constructs and comparative sequence analysis. the comparison involved a large number of species  belonging to various families, which allowed us to detect the most evolutionarily conserved elements in the regulatory region containing the potential transcription factor binding sites. using the reporter constructs, we have demonstrated that the enchanter element and promoter of vole oct <dig> gene are active in mouse pluripotent cells. we analysed vole oct <dig> gene expression in early preimplantation embryos, genital ridges of postimplantation embryos, adult tissues and stem cell lines precursors of trophoblast and extraembryonic endoderm. we have found expression only in preimplantation embryos and in genital ridges, containing primordial germ cells, consistent with oct <dig> being expressed specifically in pluripotent cells.
