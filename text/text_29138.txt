BACKGROUND
the structural classification of proteins  database is a comprehensive protein database that organizes and classifies proteins based on their evolutionary and structural relationships  <cit> . it is organized into four hierarchical levels: family, superfamily, fold, and classes. at the lowest level , individual proteins are clustered into families based on some criteria that may indicate their common evolutionary origin, such as having a pairwise sequence similarity of more than 30% or lower sequence similarity but similar functions and structures. a good example of the latter is seen in globin proteins whose pairwise sequence similarities are much lower than 30% but which have similar protein functions. next, families are grouped into superfamilies if their structures and/or function features indicate a possible common evolutionary origin. then superfamilies are clustered into folds if superfamilies share major secondary structures with the same topological arrangements. finally, different folds are grouped into classes based on their secondary structural compositions. unlike the other levels, a class might not necessarily imply common evolutionary origins and exists more for convenience than for actual biological implications.

apart from the hierarchical classification and organization of proteins, the scop database employs hidden markov models  to represent superfamilies  <cit> . the basic procedure of building an hmm for a particular superfamily starts with a seed protein and performs sequence search in a database to obtain other proteins that have sequence similarities above a set threshold. the newly obtained sequences are used to iterate the search for some number of times to obtain additional proteins. finally, all sequences are aligned and an hmm is constructed for the multiple sequence alignment  <cit> . it has been shown that different seed proteins might produce hmms that cover different members of the superfamily  <cit> . thus, in order to represent the full set of proteins in a superfamily, multiple hmms are built for the superfamily using multiple seed proteins. for example, the beta-beta-alpha zinc fingers superfamily has altogether  <dig> hmms representing it, and the p-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases superfamily has  <dig> hmms representing it.

because each superfamily might be represented by multiple hmms, there may be a high degree of overlap and redundancy among the models. however, there have not been any studies examining this issue systematically. to understand how the hmms in the scop database are related to one another and the degree of overlap or redundancy among hmms from either the same or different superfamilies, we perform a detailed analysis of the hmms in scop for their similarity and relationships using a network approach. specifically, we perform an all-against-all hhsearch for the library of hmms in the scop database.

hhsearch is similar to blast, except that instead of matching a sequence against a database of sequences, it uses a query hmm or sequence to match against a database of hmms and identifies the hmms significantly homologous to the query hmm or sequence  <cit> . we then construct a network of hmms, where the link between two hmms is based on their similarity, and examine some commonly evaluated network properties. we compare the current network with previously documented networks and outline some questions for future research.

RESULTS
general statistics of the hmms and their network
a general description of the hmms used to construct the network is shown in table  <dig>  there are seven classes in the collection of hmms, falling into  <dig> folds,  <dig> superfamilies, and  <dig> families. class c has the highest number of hmms  and class f the fewest .

the entire hmm network is shown in figure  <dig>  where the e-value cutoff is  <dig> . there are altogether  <dig>  edges for the  <dig>  vertices. a significant property shown in figure  <dig> is that the entire network is highly disconnected, with many much smaller connected components. in fact, there are altogether  <dig> connected components . the size distribution of ccs is shown in figure  <dig>  the smallest cc contains two vertices, the largest  <dig> vertices, 566/ <dig> = 37% contain only two vertices and about 73% contain five or fewer vertices. the median cc size is  <dig> and the mean  <dig> . the top  <dig> largest ccs are listed in table  <dig> 

degree distribution
the distribution of the degrees of the hmm network is shown in figure  <dig>  degree ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  with the average of  <dig> and median of  <dig>  the log-log degree distribution is also shown . it is evident that a power law distribution does not fit the data. the best fitting quadratic curve is also plotted with the data. it provides a relatively good fit for the smaller values of log, and then towards the larger degrees, the fit is not so good.

network density
density, computed as the number of edges over the number of all possible edges , provides some quantitative evaluation on the connectivity of a network. the density of the entire network is low, only  <dig>  . in contrast, individual ccs tend to have high densities , with more than  <dig> % of ccs having density greater than  <dig> .  <dig> ccs are fully connected, i.e., cliques, with the largest clique of size  <dig>  overall,  <dig> have size  <dig>   <dig> size  <dig>   <dig> size  <dig>   <dig> size  <dig>   <dig> size  <dig>  and  <dig> sizes greater than  <dig> 

thus, individual ccs tend to have very high connectivity, whereas the entire network is not well connected. the density of the  <dig> largest ccs is shown in table  <dig>  the largest cc with  <dig> vertices has the lowest density, and the 18th largest cc with  <dig> vertices has a density of  <dig>  and is therefore a fully connected component. there is a significant negative correlation between cc size and density .

vertex centrality
vertex centrality measures the "importance" of a vertex. two centrality metrics, degree and betweenness, were computed for the vertices in the entire hmm network. the top  <dig> hmms that have the highest degrees all belong to the same superfamily, b. <dig> , immunoglobulin, and also to the third largest cc that has  <dig> vertices. thus, these  <dig> hmms are connected with almost all other hmms in the third cc. the hmm d1n26a <dig> ) has the highest degree,  <dig>  belonging to the interleukin- <dig> receptor alpha chain, n-terminal domain. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> hmms that have the highest betweenness. thirteen of the  <dig> hmms belong to the superfamily c. <dig>  -binding rossmann-fold domains), two to the superfamily b <dig> . <dig>  and two to the superfamily c. <dig> . eighteen of the  <dig> hmms belong to the largest cc and the two remaining  to the second largest. the hmm d1bg6a <dig> ) has the highest betweenness,  <dig>  belonging to n--l-norvaline dehydrogenase . interestingly, there is no overlap of hmms that have the highest of both degree and betweenness.

because the entire hmm network contains many ccs, among which there are no connections, we computed three centrality measurements  for the  <dig> largest ccs. table  <dig> lists the two hmms that have one of the highest centrality measurements. unlike the observation for the entire network, there is great consistency between hmms with the highest three centrality measurements, i.e., the same hmms that have one of the highest centrality measurements, tend to also have the highest other two measurements. for example, for the largest cc, d1bg6a <dig> is the hmm with the highest betweenness, closeness, and the second highest degree. because the network has many connected components, examining the importance of vertices for these subnetworks seems to be more meaningful than for the entire network. it is thus very useful to observe that different measurements of vertex centrality give similar results, suggesting that one does not have to be overly concerned with the choice of centrality measurements when determining the important hmms.

for each row, the columns refer to the rank of the cc based on its size, the hmms  with the largest or second largest centrality measured by betweenness , closeness , and degree .

the results show that from the entire network, the vertices with the highest degrees do not necessarily have the highest betweenness, and vice versa. degree measures how many immediate neighbors one hmm has, and therefore, the more it has, the more central it is. the vertices with the  <dig> largest degrees are all from the third largest cc, and are connected to about 94% of its vertices. the vertices with the  <dig> largest betweenness are from either the largest cc or the second largest cc. since betweenness reflects how essential one vertex is to the connection of any other two vertices in the graph, in the case of hmms, it may reflect the possibility that one hmm is the hybrid of two hmms, that is, between the two hmms, there is no significant similarity, but through the one hmm, the hmms can be linked. biologically, this idea seems to reflect hybrid or mosaic proteins where one protein contains domains from multiple proteins. to our knowledge, the idea of hybrid hmms has not been discussed previously and deserves more research attention. moreover, we hypothesize that the hmms with high centrality measurements may be better able to pick up the sequences that belong to the superfamily than the more peripheral hmms. this idea seems to be especially promising considering the observation that the three centrality measurements identify similar sets of vertices within the connected components. future studies can be directed to test this hypothesis.

network diameter
the diameter of the largest cc  is  <dig>  the average distance between the vertices in the component is  <dig> . this bears some similarity to the yeast protein interaction network  <cit> , constructed using the protein interaction data from the january  <dig> version of the biogrid database, an online repository for interaction datasets aggregated from both high-throughput data and focused individual studies for the affinity of interacting protein pairs  <cit> . this protein interaction network consists of  <dig>  proteins and  <dig>  interactions. its largest cc  also has the same diameter of  <dig>  but a larger average distance of  <dig> . thus, this protein interaction network seems to have more vertices that are a bit more spread out, which contributes to a larger average distance. to this point, it is very interesting that despite the big difference in the sizes of the two ccs of the two networks, the diameters are the same.

we also measured the diameters of all the ccs to see how they change as a function of cc size. figure  <dig> shows that larger ccs tend to have larger diameters. however, smaller ccs can have large diameters as well. for example, a cc of size  <dig> has diameter seven, the same as a cc of size 155; a cc size of  <dig> has diameter six, the same as a cc of size  <dig>  there are  <dig> ccs with diameter  <dig>  corresponding to the number of cliques.

the effect of e-value cutoff on the network
as the e-value measures the degree of similarity between two hmms, we examined how changing e-value cutoff affects the general properties of the network, such as the number and sizes of ccs. figure  <dig> shows the effect of changing the e-value cutoff on the number of ccs in the network. the number of ccs increases gradually with the more stringent e-value cutoffs, reaching the highest for 10- <dig> . similar patterns are observed when only ccs that are greater than size two, three, and four are considered, generally, the number of ccs increases with more stringent e-value cutoffs. to see what specific sized cc groups are more affected by the stringency of e-value cutoffs, the cc size distribution was also studied as a function of e-value cutoffs. figure  <dig> shows that changing e-value cutoff has the largest effect on the number of ccs that are of size two, and the effect reduces greatly for larger sized ccs. with low stringency e-value cutoffs, there are more larger ccs.

ccs and scop hierarchy
within the ccs, we examined whether the hmm members are from the same family, superfamily, fold, or class. there are altogether  <dig> ccs whose members have the same scop domain classification ,  <dig> ccs whose hmms belong to the same superfamily but to different families,  <dig> whose members belong to the same fold, but to different superfamilies,  <dig> whose members belong to the same class but have different folds, and the remaining  <dig> whose members are from different classes.

the consistency between the prediction of hmm memberships at different hierarchical levels in the scop database based on the e-value cutoffs and the classification of the scop database was evaluated by roc curves, shown in figure  <dig>  we make several observations. first, for all four levels of the hierarchy, the higher the e-value cutoff, the higher the sensitivity , so is the false positive rate, which is expected because higher e-value means a less stringent prediction criterion that in turn leads to a higher number of true positive predictions, and also a higher number of false positive predictions. meanwhile, the rate of increase in sensitivity outpaces the rate of increase in the false negative rate as the e-value becomes more stringent, suggesting that beyond a certain e-value cutoff, the hmms belonging to the same hierarchical levels also tend to have high similarity, which make them robust to the e-value cutoff change. second, the curves for the prediction of fold and superfamily are very similar to each other, indicating that for the same e-value cutoff, the predictions for whether two hmms belong to the same fold or superfamily are similar. in fact, for the same e-value cutoff, the difference in true positive rate  between the fold and superfamily roc curves is either  <dig> or  <dig> , and the difference in false positive rate  falls within the narrow range . third, the prediction quality is the worst for class as compared to the other three levels, with worst sensitivity and specificity for the same e-value cutoffs. this might not be so surprising as classification at the class level is more for convenience than for biological reasons.

because fold and superfamily show similar classifications, we focused on studying the superfamilies further. in order to see how the superfamilies are represented in terms of connected components, we examined the number of hmms representing the  <dig> superfamilies to see how many ccs the hmms are dispersed into. table  <dig> shows the top ten superfamilies that have the highest number of hmm representations and also the top ten superfamilies that are split into the highest number of ccs. it shows that superfamilies differ in the extent of dispersion of their hmms, with some superfamilies having really high dispersal, some very low. for example, the superfamily c. <dig>  has  <dig> hmms, all clustered into the same cc . in contrast, a. <dig>  has  <dig> hmms, but dispersed into  <dig> ccs. we also computed a dispersal index  for all the superfamilies, and found that the superfamilies with the highest dispersal are dominated by superfamilies that have only one or two hmms, and the superfamilies with a large number of hmms tend to have low dispersal, in fact, among the  <dig> superfamilies with the lowest dispersal, six of them have the largest number of hmms.

the working hypothesis
taking into account the processes that built the hmms and the hierarchical classification of the hmms in the scop database, we hypothesize that the network should reflect this process, i.e., the hmms in a connected component belong to the same family or superfamily more often than expected under a random network connection model. the results show strong evidence that hmms in a connected component tend to represent the same family or superfamily. among the total  <dig> ccs, more than 77% have only members from the same family; more than 95% have only members from the same superfamily. thus, there is overwhelming evidence supporting our working hypothesis that hmms belonging to the same family or superfamilies tend to cluster together in the network.

however, to formally evaluate this and provide some statistical support, we also simulated  <dig>  random networks, while preserving the degree distribution and the number and sizes of connected components. each random network has the same number of connected components as our original network, and the working hypothesis predicts that the connected components of such a network have a lower degree of conservation in the family and superfamily assignment. among the  <dig>  simulated random networks, the highest proportions of ccs having only members from the same family and superfamily are as low as  <dig> % and  <dig> %. this shows that in the observed network, the hmms from the same family or superfamily do have a strong tendency to cluster, agreeing with our working hypothesis.

comparison with other networks
it is evident that the hmm network is highly clustered. in fact, its clustering coefficient is  <dig> , which, to our knowledge, seems to be the highest among the biological networks that have been studied so far. as shown by newman  <cit> , the undirected networks that tend to have high clustering coefficients are social networks. for example, the film directors network has a clustering coefficient of  <dig>  and coauthorship networks for math, physics, and biology disciplines are  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> , respectively, whereas biological networks such as metabolic network and protein interaction network have only a clustering coefficient of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . the comparison indicates that the current network has distinct features from the previously characterized real-world networks.

CONCLUSIONS
in this paper, we examined the properties of the network constructed for hmm models in the scop protein structural classification database. a number of questions remain to be addressed in future research. for example, can we devise a computational method to measure or evaluate the degree of redundancy or overlap between hmm models that are used to represent the same superfamily? this research is meaningful given the ever increasing number of large-scale genomic sequences . given that we can measure the redundancy of the hmms of a superfamily, the logical question becomes, can we computationally reduce the redundancy of the hmm library, e.g., possibly by constructing super-hmms, each of which represents a collection of redundant hmms, so that a protein sequence is scanned against a reduced set of hmms  rather than the entire set of hmms that have overlaps and redundancies? finally, because the hmm network shows distinct properties from many documented networks as discussed above, can we propose a theoretical model to better account for the observations in the current network? moreover, as our hmm network is also weighted, with edges quantifying the similarity between two hmms, future proposed models can also consider the incorporation of weighted edges into the network.
