BACKGROUND
in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae the protein phosphatase cdc <dig> must be activated to turn off mitotic cdk activity for cells to exit mitosis. there are two groups of proteins that regulate cdc <dig> activity, the cdc <dig> early anaphase release  network and the mitotic exit network  .

there is one cyclin-dependent kinase , cdc <dig>  that controls cell cycle progression in s. cerevisiae by associating with mitotic cyclins, cdc <dig> promotes entry into mitosis. cdc <dig> plays a critical role in inactivating mitotic cdk activity, thereby promoting exit from mitosis. cdc <dig> dephosphorylates hct1/cdh <dig> which can then target clb <dig>  the main mitosis-specific cyclin, for degradation  <cit> . cdc <dig> also promotes the accumulation of sic <dig>  a cdk inhibitor, by acting on sic <dig> as well as transcriptional activator swi <dig>  which promotes transcription of sic <dig>  <cit> . together, the degradation of mitotic cyclins and the production of active sic <dig> conspire to down-regulate cdc <dig> activity and return the cell cycle to an interphase state.

cdc <dig> is held in an inactive state in the nucleolus by its inhibitor, net <dig>  <cit> . cdc <dig> is tethered to net <dig> throughout the cell cycle until the onset of anaphase, at which time it is released. the fear network and men both regulate cdc <dig> release and therefore its activity . the fear network initiates early anaphase release of cdc <dig> from the nucleolus by promoting net <dig> phosphorylation by mitotic cdks, weakening the interaction between cdc <dig> and net <dig>  <cit> . the fear network consists of esp <dig> , polo-like kinase cdc <dig>  the kinetochore protein slk <dig>  the nuclear protein spo <dig>  and its homologue bns <dig>  the action of these proteins is opposed by pds <dig>  and the nucleolar replication fork block protein fob <dig>  <cit> . however, it is still unclear how the factors that promote and restrain fear interact. although the release of cdc <dig> in early anaphase by the fear network is transient and insufficient for mitotic exit, exit is delayed when the fear network is compromised by mutation. one possible explanation is that the fear network weakens the cdc14-net <dig> interaction, enabling the men to more rapidly cause a sustained release of cdc <dig>  the fear network also has other mitotic functions that may play an important role in coordinating events during exit from mitosis .

in contrast to the fear network, the men is essential for mitotic exit . this pathway consists of the gtpase tem <dig>  the putative guanine-nucleotide exchange factor  lte <dig>  the two-component gtpase activating protein  bub2-bfa <dig>  the protein kinases cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  dbf <dig>  the dbf <dig> binding protein mob <dig>  and the scaffolding protein, nud <dig>  genetic and biochemical data have provided significant insight into how this signaling cascade is activated by the localization of its components. bub2-bfal binds and inhibits tem <dig> at the spindle pole body  that enters the daughter cell during nuclear division. as the spindle elongates into the bud, tem <dig> is presumably activated by lte <dig>  which is localized in the bud  <cit> . the activated gtp-bound form of tem <dig> then somehow activates bound cdc <dig>  which then phosphorylates and activates the dbf2-mob <dig> kinase complex  <cit> . however, how activated dbf2-mob <dig> affects cdc <dig> release from net <dig> and mitotic exit is unknown.

in addition to their role in mitotic exit, dbf2-mob <dig> and the other men proteins function in cytokinesis. dbf <dig> localizes to the spb in anaphase as do tem <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  and mob <dig>  <cit> . during late mitosis, dbf <dig> and mob <dig> migrate to the bud neck. bud neck localization of dbf <dig> and mob <dig> are dependent on each other as well as the men proteins cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  cdc <dig>  nud <dig>  and the septins cdc <dig> and cdc <dig>  <cit> . several lines of evidence suggest that localization of men proteins to the bud neck is crucial for cytokinesis. mutant mob1ts cells, as well as tem1Δ net1- <dig> and cdc15Δ net1- <dig> cells whose mitotic exit defects are bypassed by the net1- <dig> allele fail to undergo cytokinesis  <cit> . interestingly, localization of dbf2-mob <dig> to the bud neck depends upon cdc <dig>  <cit> . men-dependent release and activation of cdc <dig> may help to ensure that mitotic exit occurs prior to cytokinesis.

the function of dbf2-mob <dig> in cytokinesis is unclear. also unknown is how dbf2-mob <dig> ultimately leads to release of cdc <dig> from the nucleolus during mitotic exit. to give us insight into these two key cell cycle processes, we sought to identify potential substrates and phosphorylation sites of dbf2-mob <dig>  here, we report the substrate specificity of dbf2-mob <dig> and a number of putative substrates that contain a dbf <dig> phosphorylation motif and are phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> in vitro.

RESULTS
determination of optimal peptide sequence motif phosphorylated by dbf2-mob1
to identify potential physiological substrates of dbf2-mob <dig>  we first proceeded to determine an optimal substrate sequence by using an oriented degenerate peptide library technique  <cit> . dbf <dig>  a ser/thr kinase, was initially tested to determine whether there was a preference for phosphorylation on ser or thr residues. degenerate peptide libraries containing either a fixed ser residue, xxxxsxxxx, or a fixed thr residue, xxxxtxxxx, were incubated with atp and dbf2-mob <dig> that was expressed in insect cells, purified, and activated by recombinant cdc <dig>  all amino acids except cys, ser, thr, and tyr are represented by x, where the last  <dig> residues were omitted to limit phosphorylation to the fixed ser or thr. the level of phosphorylation was determined by the amount of radioactive phosphate incorporated in the peptides. this analysis suggested that dbf2-mob <dig> had a preference for ser phosphorylation over thr .

recombinant baculovirus-derived fhhdbf2-h6mob1tm <dig> activated by baculovirus-derived cdc15his <dig> was used to screen different peptide libraries.

to determine the optimal peptide substrate for dbf2-mob <dig>  we screened secondary libraries that contain a fixed residue in addition to the serine phosphorylation site. the rationale for this is articulated in songyang et. al.  <cit> . we chose to examine a library with an r fixed at - <dig> , because dbf <dig> resides on the 'agc' branch of the protein kinase family tree  <cit> . other kinases on this branch, including akt  <cit>  and pka  <cit>  preferentially phosphorylate substrates with an r at - <dig>  as a control, we also examined a library with the sequence x4spx <dig>  the x4rx2sx <dig> library was found to incorporate  <dig> times more phosphate than the x4spx <dig> library . as a result, the x4rx2sx <dig> library was used to determine an optimal dbf2-mob <dig> substrate motif. sequencing a pool of dbf2-phosphorylated peptides enriched from the rs library revealed a strong preference for ile and phe at the - <dig> and - <dig> positions, respectively . there was a moderate selection for met at both the - <dig> and + <dig> positions . the predicted optimal consensus motif for dbf2-mob <dig> substrates was determined to be mrifsm.

activated fhhdbf2-h6mob1tm <dig> was used to screen the peptide library with the sequence x-x-x-x-r-x-x-s-x-x-x-x. relative selectivities for amino acids are indicated in parentheses. bold letters indicate amino acids that are strongly selected; x indicates no selectivity. the one-letter amino acid code is used.

optimal sequence phosphorylation efficiency
to evaluate the contribution of each residue in the predicted optimal consensus motif, we synthesized a peptide based on the consensus motif, as well as a set of variants in which each position was substituted by an alanine residue . peptides with tyr at - <dig>  and lys at - <dig>  were also synthesized to determine whether the selection of phe at position - <dig> could be replaced by another bulky residue like tyr, or if the arg at position - <dig> could be substituted with the similarly charged lys. the nt-control peptide contains a substitution in the arg residue that lies outside of the predicted consensus motif to determine whether there is a selection at that position. finally, we generated a negative control peptide that contains the consensus except that the ser phosphorylation site was replaced with ala.

the synthetic peptides were treated with dbf2-mob <dig> in vitro for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> or  <dig> minutes and the amount of phosphorylation was determined . as a negative control, the optimal consensus peptide was treated in parallel with the kinase-inactive dbf2-mob <dig> that had undergone the same treatment with cdc <dig> as the wild type dbf2-mob <dig> complex . as expected, the negative control peptide, as well as the r-3a peptide both had negligible levels of phosphorylation . the optimal peptide treated with kinase inactive dbf2-mob <dig> was also negligibly phosphorylated . for the remaining peptides in which measurable levels of phosphorylation were detected, the vmax and kcat for dbf2-mob <dig> were calculated .

there did not appear to be selection for ile at the - <dig> position nor selection for the arg in the - <dig> position outside of the consensus motif, as both mutant peptides were phosphorylated to a similar degree as the optimal peptide , with similar vmaxand kcat values for dbf2-mob <dig> . mutations of the bulkier groups at positions - <dig>  - <dig>  and + <dig> to ala actually increased the amount of phosphorylation of the peptides , increasing the vmax and kcat values for dbf2-mob <dig> . this was surprising because the peptide library screen had indicated a strong selection for phe at position - <dig>  however, the flag peptide used to elute dbf2-mob <dig> may have influenced the selection of phosphopeptides during the screening procedure. interestingly, the substitution of arg by lys in position - <dig> decreased the amount of peptide phosphorylation to a level comparable to the negative controls . taken together, these results revealed a preference for non-bulky residues proximal to the ser phosphorylation site and that the critical arg required for substrate phosphorylation cannot be substituted with lys – at least in the context of a peptide substrate.

to confirm the results of the peptide library screen by an independent method, we screened a phosphosite array with active and kinase-dead dbf2-mob <dig> in the presence of -atp. the phosphosite array contains  <dig> peptides that correspond to annotated sites of phosphorylation in the human proteome  <cit> . replicate experiments were performed, and the 'hits' that were obtained with kinase-dead dbf2-mob <dig> were subtracted. analysis of the top  <dig> peptide substrates for active dbf <dig>  from the first experiment revealed that 18/ <dig> contained a serine phosphorylation site , whereas all twenty possessed an r at - <dig>  in the replicate experiment, all eight candidates had an rxxs motif. the only other bias revealed in this analysis – albeit a modest one – was a general preference for r in positions n-terminal to the phosphorylation site. thus, two different methods – a library-based selection for phosphopeptides and a screen of a phosphopeptide array – suggest that dbf <dig> phosphorylates serines spaced three amino acid downstream of an arginine.

proteome array screen identifies in vitro dbf2-mob <dig> substrates
the relatively low sequence complexity of the dbf <dig> phosphorylation motif diminished the power of using genome-wide bioinformatics screens to identify putative substrates. accordingly, we carried out a proteome array screen to identify putative yeast substrates. proteome chips spotted with ~ <dig>  different glutathione-s-transferase  fusion proteins purified from yeast were probed with activated dbf2-mob <dig>  kinase-inactive dbf2-mob <dig>  and buffer alone. after taking into account the proteins phosphorylated in the negative controls,  <dig> proteins were determined to be putative dbf2-mob <dig> substrates .

activated fhhdbf2-h6mob1tm <dig> was used to screen the yeast proteome chip. of  <dig> proteins phosphorylated by fhhdbf2-h6mob1tm <dig>   <dig> were determined to be putative substrates after taking into account proteins that were phosphorylated in the control slides treated with the kinase-inactive fhhdbf2-h6mob1tm <dig> 

to confirm that the proteins identified in the proteome array screen could be phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> as opposed to being bound to dbf <dig> substrates, we performed further analyses on the  <dig> proteins with the highest incorporation signal relative to protein amount . interestingly, three or more copies of this motif were found in  <dig>  or 64%, of the proteins in the list , compared to only 29% of the proteins encoded in the yeast genome. this enrichment for proteins with  <dig> or more copies of the rxxs motif is highly significant .

of the  <dig> putative substrates, the  <dig> putative substrates with the highest relative amount of phosphorylation signal  as listed were chosen for further study. mw: predicted molecular weight, # or r- <dig> sites: number of rxxs motifs

tap-tagged strains were obtained for  <dig> of the  <dig> top candidates. tap-tagged alleles for three of the genes  were not available, and therefore these candidates were not subjected to further analysis. asynchronous cultures of the  <dig> tap-tagged strains were grown and the tap-tagged proteins immunoprecipitated with igg sepharose and analyzed by western blotting . candidates were determined to be phosphorylated if a radioactive signal was detected at the molecular weight predicted for the tagged protein. of the  <dig> strains in which immunoprecipitations were performed, ybr138c , yal051w , ynl101w , yil135c , and ymr184w did not have detectable protein expression. the  <dig> tap-tagged proteins that were expressed and purified were used in dbf2-mob <dig> kinase assays . of the  <dig>   <dig> were determined to be phosphorylated. to determine whether the phosphorylation of these proteins was specific to dbf2-mob <dig>  rather than due to a co-precipitating protein kinase or residual cdc <dig> used to activate dbf2-mob <dig>  kinase assays were performed using kinase-inactive dbf <dig> as a negative control . in all cases, there was a strong decrease in incorporation when kinase-inactive dbf2-mob <dig> was used. these results suggest that the proteins identified by the proteome chip screen were indeed in vitro substrates of dbf2-mob <dig> 

in attempts to confirm whether any of the dbf2-mob <dig> substrates identified by our analyses are true physiological substrates of this complex, we took four approaches. first, we examined whether any of the substrates undergo a molecular weight shift upon their phosphorylation by dbf2-mob <dig>  which might serve as a simple diagnostic to evaluate phosphorylation in vivo. next, we immunoprecipitated each protein from yeast cells via the tap tag, and immunoblotted for mob <dig> to determine if the putative substrates were associated with the dbf <dig> complex. third, we queried the yeast gfp localization database, to see if any of the candidates display spb or bud neck localization characteristic of dbf2-mob <dig>  finally, we searched a database of  <dig> mapped yeast phosphorylation sites to see if any of them reside in our candidate substrates. unfortunately, none of these efforts yielded a positive result . this experience highlights that validation of putative protein kinase substrates identified by proteome chip analysis may require considerable investment in the mapping of in vivo phosphorylation sites.

discussion
the substrate used to test dbf2-mob <dig> kinase activity, histone h <dig>  is a commonly used artificial substrate for many protein kinases. we wanted to find physiological protein substrates of dbf2-mob <dig>  to do so, we first sought to define the optimal phosphorylation site motif for dbf2-mob <dig> substrates. peptide library screening revealed the putative optimal substrate motif to be mrifsm . however, when we tested each residue in in vitro dbf2-mob <dig> peptide kinase assays, the only substitutions that diminished incorporation were swapping the arg in position - <dig> for ala or lys . the latter result was unexpected, because ndr <dig>  a human homologue of dbf <dig>  was proposed to phosphorylate sequences with either lys or arg in the - <dig> position  <cit> . although dbf <dig> exhibits a strong requirement for an r at - <dig>  it displays remarkably little bias for any other position adjacent to the phosphorylation site. a similar result was obtained by performing a screen of a phosphosite array composed of peptides that correspond to annotated sites of phosphorylation in the human proteome.

the proteins identified by proteome chip screening gave further evidence that the rxxs motif serves as a substrate for dbf2-mob <dig> phosphorylation, as 80% of the top  <dig> proteins that were identified in the proteome chip analysis contained this motif. of these proteins,  <dig> were tested further and  <dig> of these were identified as in vitro substrates,  <dig> of which have the rxxs motif. pre <dig> and adk <dig> were phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> but not its kinase inactive form despite not having the rxxs motif . one reason may be that both proteins are immunoprecipitated at high levels and therefore may serve as non-specific substrates of dbf2-mob <dig> 

recently, the results of a systematic proteome array analysis of yeast protein kinases have been posted online . there were a few minor discrepancies between the results posted online for dbf2-mob <dig> and those of table  <dig>  with the exception of cbf <dig>  oaf <dig>  and htz <dig>  these  <dig> proteins were within the top  <dig> proteins that gave the highest signal in our original data set  yet were not in the data set posted online. the discrepancies were based on the methodology for identifying positive signals. in our original data set, the results were obtained by computer analysis. further visual analysis to confirm positives was performed for the data available online. upon visual confirmation, cbf <dig>  oaf <dig>  and htz <dig> were determined to be incorrectly identified by computer analysis . our in vitro analysis confirmed that two of these proteins  were indeed negatives as neither cbf <dig> nor htz <dig> were found to be phosphorylated by dbf2-mob <dig> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have determined that protein kinase dbf2-mob <dig> has a preference for phosphorylating peptides and proteins that bear one or more rxxs motifs. although there is strong selection for the r at - <dig>  there is remarkably little selection at any other position, suggesting that dbf <dig> achieves specificity by docking its substrates at a site that is distinct from the phosphorylation site.
