BACKGROUND
carboxylesterases  catalyse many hydrolytic and transesterification reactions and use a wide range of substrates, including xenobiotic carboxyl esters, thioesters and aromatic amides, anticancer drugs such as cpt- <dig> and capecitabine, narcotics such as heroine and cocaine, clinical drugs such as lovastatin and lidocaine, organophosphate and carbamate poisons such as sarin, tabun and soman and insecticides   <cit> . the enzyme also catalyses reactions in cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism, including fatty acyl coa hydrolase  <cit> , acyl coa: cholesterol acyl transferase  <cit> , cholesterol:ester hydrolase  <cit> , acyl carnitine hydrolase  <cit> , fatty acyl: ethyl ester synthase  <cit>  and triacylglycerol hydrolase  <cit> , and may serve specific roles in lung surfactant  <cit>  and pheromone  <cit>  metabolism. ces is predominantly localized in the endoplasmic reticulum  and has an n-terminal hydrophobic signal peptide consistent with a trafficking role through the er  <cit> .

ces is widely distributed in biological organisms and has been extensively studied in mammals, particularly in humans, mouse and rat  <cit> . six human ces genes have been reported on chromosome 16: ces <dig>  encoding the major liver enzyme which is also found in lung epithelia, macrophages and other tissues  <cit> ; ces <dig>  encoding the major intestinal enzyme and also expressed in liver, kidney, heart and skeletal muscle  <cit> ; ces <dig>  expressed in liver, colon and small intestine  <cit> ; and ces <dig>  <cit> , ces <dig>  <cit>  and ces <dig>  <cit> , the products of which are less well characterized as proteins. the genes occur in  <dig> clusters approximately  <dig> million bps apart on chromosome 16: ces <dig> ces <dig> ces <dig> and ces <dig> ces <dig> ces <dig> . the close proximity and sequence similarity of these genes  imply that they arose from an ancestral gene duplication event  <cit> . tertiary and quaternary structures for several human ces <dig> complexes have been determined at high resolution  which are consistent with three functional domains: the catalytic domain containing the active site 'triad' and the carbohydrate binding site; the αβ domain supporting the majority of the hydrophobic internal structure and the subunit-subunit binding sites; and the regulatory domain which facilitates substrate binding, product release and the trimer-hexamer equilibrium  <cit> .

studies on the evolution of ces have demonstrated that genetic variability for this enzyme contributes significantly to selection, particularly for drosophila, where multiple genes have been identified, including est <dig>  which plays a key role in reproduction, and jhe , which serves an essential role in insect development  <cit> . in addition, evolutionary selection mechanisms for insecticide resistance have been observed in several arthropod species by the amplification of ces genes  <cit> . previous studies on mammalian ces evolution have focused on the identification and classification of multiple ces genes, particularly for human, mouse, rat and other eutherian mammals  <cit> . initial studies described two major mammalian ces gene families, ces <dig> and ces <dig>  which apparently evolved from an ancestral ces gene  <cit> , whereas more recent reports have proposed five ces gene families, based on phylogenetic analyses of  <dig> sequences of mammalian ces  <cit> , which are consistent with the five families of human ces genes described earlier  <cit> .

this paper extends current knowledge on ces evolution to a marsupial species and reports the cdna and deduced amino acid sequence for an opossum ces , rt-pcr expression and in silico studies providing evidence for ces <dig> and ces <dig> 'like' genes on chromosome  <dig> of the opossum and the phylogenetic relationships of opossum ces <dig>  and predicted opossum ces gene products with human cess. the opossum is a marsupial which is used as an animal model in studying the genetics of heart disease and cancer  <cit> , and given the roles of mammalian ces in cholesterol, fatty acid and xenobiotic metabolism, these studies may contribute significantly to the identification of candidate genes for these diseases. in addition, this report on opossum ces provides evidence for the appearance of five ces gene families prior to metatherian mammals during vertebrate evolution.

RESULTS
opossum ces <dig> gene products
the open reading frame of the full-length cdna  comprised  <dig> nucleotides; and the 5' utr and 3' utr comprised  <dig> nucleotides and  <dig> nucleotides, respectively. this was obtained by using primers based on a  <dig> bp opossum cdna  showing sequence similarity to mammalian ces to amplify a full-length opossum ces cdna from liver rna. the best-scoring alignment in a blast analysis  <cit>  for the opossum cdna sequence was with a human ces <dig> sequence, and the opossum cdna is referred to as ces <dig>  . using the opossum ces <dig> cdna as the query in a blat search  <cit> , we found two additional ces gene regions and cdnas which are referred to as ces <dig>   and ces <dig>   . these latter genes were subjected to further analyses using rt-pcr and sequencing the product ces cdnas.

opossum ces <dig> and ces <dig> gene expression studies
expression of the predicted ces genes in the liver and small intestine was analyzed by rt-pcr . controls were also conducted to ensure that dnase-treated liver and intestine rnas could not serve as templates for rt- pcr .

an opossum ces <dig> gene was identified by in silico methods using the human ces <dig> amino acid sequence to interrogate the opossum genome  <cit>  in a blat analysis  <cit> . primers based on the predicted opossum ces <dig> cdna sequence amplified a  <dig> bp pcr product which was similar to the predicted pcr product , indicating that the ces <dig> gene is expressed in liver and intestine.

unlike the ces <dig> gene, the ces <dig>  gene was expressed in the liver, but not in the small intestine. the ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  genes were also identified by in silico methods. primers for the ces <dig>  cdna amplified an  <dig> bp pcr product, which was similar to the predicted pcr product , indicating that the ces <dig>  gene is expressed in liver and intestine. however, primers for ces <dig>  cdna amplified a pcr product of about  <dig> bp, which is larger than the  <dig> bp pcr product based on the predicted cdna sequence. the ces <dig>  cdna was sequenced  and this showed that  <dig> nucleotides were missing from the predicted blat derived sequence. the pcr product for the ces <dig>  gene should have been  <dig> bp. these results indicate that the ces <dig>  gene is expressed in both liver and small intestine and that the blat derived sequence contained a deletion as compared with the actual sequence for the ces <dig>  rt-pcr product. we also sequenced the ces <dig>  cdna , and found that  <dig> nucleotides in the predicted sequence were absent in the ces <dig>  cdna sequence. these rt-pcr studies of opossum ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  genes show that the blat software  <cit>  used to predict sequences for opossum ces gene products did not fully recognize all of the intron-exon junctions resulting in some deletions or insertions that are not found in the in vivo gene product. this emphasizes the importance of undertaking cdna sequencing to obtain sequences for these and other cdnas.

opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  deduced amino acid sequences
the deduced amino acid sequence for opossum ces <dig>  is shown in figure  <dig> with the previously reported sequence for human ces <dig>  <cit> , together with the predicted protein sequences for opossum ces <dig>  and ces <dig> . the latter sequences were predicted from blat studies  <cit>  using the opossum ces <dig>  sequence to interrogate the opossum genome but corrected following alignment with the ces <dig>   and ces <dig>   sequences. the three opossum ces <dig> like sequences were very similar, especially for the ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  sequences, which shared 94% sequence identity. in addition, the deduced amino acid sequences for opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  showed 56–57% sequence identity with human ces <dig> and 44–47% identity with human ces <dig> .

several key residues in these enzymes were conserved, including  cys94/cys <dig> and cys278/cys <dig>  the sites for disulfide bond formation in human ces <dig>  <cit> , and active site residues responsible for the formation of acyl-ester intermediates  and the charge relay system in catalysis  and his   <cit> . the deduced amino acid sequence for opossum ces <dig>  was  <dig> residues shorter  than for human ces <dig> , and lacked the microsomal targeting sequence at the c-terminus end of the enzyme. the human ces <dig> c-terminal tetrapeptide sequence, his-thr-glu-leu , functions in protein retrieval from the golgi apparatus and in ces retention in the er lumen  <cit> , but this is missing in opossum ces <dig>  which may then influence the subcellular location and metabolic role for this enzyme in opossum liver. in contrast, opossum ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  sequences retain a homologous arg-met-glu-leu  tetrapeptide sequence and these enzymes may then be localized within the liver endoplasmic reticulum. opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  sequences however share a homologous hydrophobic n-terminus signal peptide  with human ces <dig>   <cit> .

the n-glycosylation site reported in human ces <dig>  <cit>  was also found in opossum ces <dig>   with four additional potential n-glycosylation sites observed at 274asn-leu-ser, 293asn-lys-thr, 376asn-ile-ser and 425asn-ser-ser. in contrast, opossum ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  lacked the n-glycosylation site at the corresponding position , as did human ces <dig> , but retained another potential site  in common with opossum ces <dig> . the two charge clamps reported for human ces <dig>  <cit>  which contribute to the formation of trimers and hexamers for this enzyme are retained for one site on each of the opossum ces <dig> like gene products  but not for the second site  in each case . the impact on the tertiary and potential quaternary structures for these opossum ces <dig> like enzymes remains to be determined, however it is relevant to note that human and baboon ces <dig> are monomers, presumably as a result of the lack of both charge clamps and the n-glycosylation site for sialic acid attachment, which contribute to subunit-subunit binding for human ces <dig>  <cit> .

other key functional residues for human ces <dig> and ces <dig> have been retained by the opossum ces <dig> like enzymes, including the 'z-site' , which functions in cholesterol binding; the 'side door' residues at 424val.met <dig> phe426; and the 'gate' residue 551phe , both of which have either been retained or have undergone conservative substitution. these latter sequences apparently function in facilitating the release of fatty acyl or aromatic groups, respectively, following hydrolysis  <cit> . in addition to the extensive sequence similarities observed for the human ces <dig> and opossum ces2like products, there are strong similarities in predicted secondary structures for these enzymes suggesting that the αβ-hydrolase structure previously reported for human ces <dig>  <cit>  has been predominantly retained by these enzymes . there were some differences observed however for predicted secondary structures for the opossum ces <dig> like enzymes near key residues and these may influence enzyme function. for example, predicted helical secondary structures near the 'z-site' and 'side door' were of different lengths for these enzymes which may influence ligand binding and product release, respectively.

predicted opossum ces <dig> amino acid sequence
the predicted amino acid sequence for opossum ces <dig> is shown in figure  <dig> together with previously reported sequences for human ces <dig> and other opossum and human ces sequences  <cit> . the predicted opossum ces <dig> amino acid sequence  was longer  than human ces <dig>  with an additional  <dig> residues at the n-terminus end which did not align with the human ces <dig> sequence. given the similarity of the predicted sequence for opossum ces <dig> with human ces <dig> at the n-terminus and our observations of incorrectly predicted splice sites, it is likely that opossum ces <dig> shares the same n-terminus start point with human ces <dig> and it is this sequence that is included in figure  <dig> 

sequencing the rt-pcr product using primers derived from the predicted opossum ces <dig> sequence enabled confirmation of  <dig> bp of this sequence .

the predicted amino acid sequence for opossum ces <dig> showed 63% identity with human ces <dig> and 46% identity with human ces <dig> supporting its designation within the ces <dig> family . opossum ces <dig> also shared several key residues with human ces <dig>  including the active site 'triad', ser <dig>  glu <dig> and his <dig> ; the corresponding cysteine residues forming the disulfide bonds in human ces <dig> ; the microsomal c-terminus retention sequence his-ile-glu-leu ; and the high-mannose n-linked glycosylation site at asn190-x-thr. two other potential glycosylation sites  were also observed for the opossum ces <dig> sequence . the n-terminal microsomal signal peptide for human ces <dig>  which retains the enzyme within the er  <cit>  was identical in sequence with the predicted opossum ces <dig> sequence, and both sequences retain  <dig> homologous residues in corresponding positions.

subunit-subunit charge clamps reported for human ces <dig>  <cit>  are retained for the predicted opossum ces <dig> protein: 72glu predicted charge clamp186arg; and 78lys predicted charge clamp183glu, suggesting that this enzyme may share the trimer-hexamer quaternary structure. the 'z-site' glycine residue, which is a site for binding cholesterol analogues in human ces <dig>  has been substituted in the opossum ces <dig> sequence  which may reflect a change in the ligand binding properties for this enzyme. the 'side door' and 'gate' sequences for human ces <dig> , which function in facilitating the release of fatty acid and aromatic products respectively following hydrolysis of substrate  <cit> , have also undergone substitutions for these key sites, involving two of three 'side door' residues  and the 'gate' residue  for opossum ces <dig>  in each case, however, the hydropathic nature of these sites has been retained, which may reflect retention of functions for these sites. the predicted secondary structure for opossum ces <dig> was similar with that reported for human ces <dig>  <cit> , although differences in helical lengths at the 'side door' and 'gate' sites were apparent .

comparisons of opossum ces <dig>  ces <dig> 'like' and ces <dig> 'like' sequences with human ces sequences
a number of differences were observed however between these family members, which have been previously reported for the human ces family members  <cit> . human and opossum ces <dig> showed longer and distinct n-terminal sequences which may reflect differences in processing the signal peptide in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . functional charge clamps that perform key roles in maintaining the trimeric-hexameric subunit structures for human ces <dig>  <cit>  were notably absent from human ces <dig> and ces <dig>  while opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  as well as human ces <dig> and ces <dig> had only one charge clamp. these may contribute to differences in the tertiary and quaternary structures for these enzymes, in particular the monomeric subunit structure for human and baboon ces <dig>  <cit>  . the tetrapeptide c-terminal sequence  which performs a key role of retaining ces <dig> within the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit>  was also found  in human ces <dig>  and ces <dig> , and in opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>   but was notably absent from opossum ces <dig>  and from human ces <dig> and ces <dig> c-terminal sequences. it is likely that these enzymes have different subcellular distribution profiles as compared with other ces gene products. as mentioned previously, the n-glycosylation site reported for human ces <dig>  is retained for the opossum ces <dig>  and ces <dig>   sequences, but is absent from other opossum and human ces gene products, whereas opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  , ces <dig>   and ces <dig>   have other potential glycosylation sites . human ces <dig> , opossum ces <dig> , human ces <dig> ; and human ces <dig>  sequences also exhibit other potential glycosylation sites which may contribute to carbohydrate binding for these proteins.

amino acid substitutions were observed for other key regions reported for human ces <dig>  including the z-site gly <dig>   <cit> , which was retained for human and opossum ces2like gene products and human ces <dig>  but replaced in opossum ces <dig>  human ces <dig> and in opossum and human ces <dig> sequences; the human ces <dig> 'side door' sequence at 423val-met-phe <dig>  and the 'aromatic-releasing' residue  at 551phe have each undergone conservative substitutions for the opossum and human ces sequences analyzed. the impacts of these changes on the structures and functions for these enzymes remain to be determined.

locations for opossum ces <dig>  ces <dig> and ces <dig> 'like' genes on chromosome 1
opossum ces <dig>  cdna  was cloned and sequenced. using blat  <cit>  to align the cdna sequence to the recently published genome  <cit>  revealed that the gene is localized on chromosome  <dig>  the identification of this gene as ces <dig>  is based upon the identity of the corresponding predicted protein with the deduced amino acid sequence for opossum ces <dig>  . the blat studies localized this gene on chromosome  <dig> at nucleotides  <dig> ,919– <dig> , <dig> on the negative strand with  <dig> % identity . two further ces <dig> 'like' genes were identified on this chromosome at nucleotides  <dig> ,395– <dig> , <dig>  and  <dig> ,454– <dig> , <dig> , also on the negative strand. consequently, all  <dig> ces <dig> like genes are localized within  <dig> kb of dna on chromosome  <dig> . the predicted proteins from the genes  were highly similar with each other  and with opossum ces <dig>   .

the human ces <dig> amino acid sequence was used for blat interrogation of the opossum genome, generating an opossum ces <dig> homologue gene and a predicted amino acid sequence for this enzyme. the responsible gene  was located at nucleotides  <dig> ,784– <dig> , <dig> on chromosome  <dig> with a span of  <dig> nucleotides on the negative strand . this protein was more similar with human ces <dig>  than with human ces <dig>  . another study was conducted using human ces <dig> for blat interrogation of the opossum genome and evidence obtained for a region of sequence similarity, located within  <dig> kb of the ces <dig>  gene . a predicted protein sequence for opossum ces <dig> was obtained and compared with other opossum and human ces gene product sequences in figure  <dig>  these results strongly suggest that there are three ces <dig> 'like' genes which are  <dig> kb apart on opossum chromosome 1; a ces <dig> 'like' gene, which is  <dig> kb closer to the pter region than the ces <dig> gene complex; and a ces <dig> 'like' gene, which is further upstream on chromosome one . the rt-pcr studies reported earlier for opossum ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  genes confirm the existence, expression and sequences for ces coding regions for these opossum genes.

human ces <dig> and ces <dig> amino acid sequences were also used to interrogate the opossum genome using the blat method  <cit> , however the results were inconclusive and further molecular genetic analyses will be required to establish the presence or otherwise of these ces genes on the opossum genome.

phylogeny and divergence of mammalian ces sequences
a phylogenetic tree  was estimated using a progressive alignment of  <dig> human ces amino acid sequences with the following opossum ces sequences: ces <dig>  ; ces <dig>  ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  ; and ces <dig>   <cit> . we also included other vertebrate ces homologues including chicken, frog and salmon, in addition to two divergent fly sequences as outgroup sequences.

the amino acid distance tree  shows a cluster of five main groups consistent with ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  and ces <dig> gene families being products of ancestral gene duplication events, and indicates that all families arose prior to the divergence of therian mammals ~173– <dig> mya  <cit> . this is consistent with a previous report for mammalian ces genes  <cit>  and also with other studies that showed mammalian ces <dig>  ces <dig> and ces <dig> are members of distinct but related gene families  <cit>  . phylogenetic trees based on maximum parsimony and bayesian methods produce very similar results, with similarly high bootstrap and posterior probability support for the distinct ces clusters observed in the distance tree . no strong support for early branching patterns emerged from any of the different phylogenetic analyses, suggesting the different gene families arose during a short period of time.

opossum ces <dig> is an member of the gene ces <dig> family which has been previously shown to include other mammalian ces <dig> gene products from human, baboon, rat and mouse, as well as human ces <dig>  <cit>  . opossum ces <dig> , ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  gene product sequences, however, show phylogenetic association within the eutherian ces <dig> group, which includes multiple ces2-like genes from mouse and rat   <cit> . eutherian ces <dig>  ces <dig> and ces <dig> genes form distinct lineages, each originating during the early, pre-mammalian radiation of the ces gene family. human ces <dig> shares 46% identity with human and opossum ces <dig> gene products . human and opossum ces <dig> and human ces <dig> share an average 40% and 42% identity respectively, with other human and opossum ces products . our inclusion and phylogenetic placement of chicken, frog and salmon sequences  is consistent with the view that the early ces divergence events occurred during the early stages of tetrapod evolution, but following divergence from bony fishes, which diverged much earlier from the common ancestor of all tetrapod ces sequences.

estimates of evolutionary dates for ces gene duplication events
we estimated the times of divergence for the ces gene family and its members using a relaxed clock approach  <cit> , an amino acid alignment, and three major calibration points: mouse-human, eutherian-marsupial, and synapsid-diapsid divergence times estimated from the literature. our results suggest that the earliest branching events that produced the extant mammalian ces gene families occurred between  <dig> and  <dig> mya . divergence dates for the earliest splits coincide with the divergence time of tetrapods approximately 350– <dig> mya based on both molecular and paloeontological data  <cit>  and are consistent with these events predating the tetrapod divergence and post-dating the tetrapod-bony fish split based on two observations: the placement of chicken and frog ces sequences in different ces gene families, and the early divergence of salmon ces-like sequence from the tetrapod sequences . based on these findings, it is proposed that several ancient ces gene duplication events took place prior to the origin of mammals, generating five ancestral genes for ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig> and ces <dig>  which have all been retained over the past 180– <dig> million years of mammalian evolution. subsequent gene duplications apparently took place prior to  and during  the evolutionary diversification of extant marsupials  <cit> , generating three ces2-like genes in the opossum genome, in contrast to a single ces <dig> gene found in some eutherians.

CONCLUSIONS
we have conducted the first study of marsupial ces genes using blat  <cit>  interrogation of the recently published opossum genome sequence  <cit>  and studied gene expression by rt-pcr, and sequenced opossum ces <dig> and ces2like cdnas. we found that opossum ces genes are located in two regions on chromosome  <dig>  with a ces1like gene ~ <dig> million bp upstream of a ces2/ces <dig> gene cluster, which comprises three ces2like genes  and a ces6like gene. an opossum ces <dig>  cdna was isolated and sequenced and the predicted protein sequence shown to be more similar to human ces <dig> among six human ces sequences previously reported. rt-pcr expression studies demonstrated that the opossum ces <dig>  ces <dig>  and ces <dig>  genes are transcribed in opossum liver and intestine, whereas the opossum ces <dig>  gene was expressed in liver and not intestine. amino acid sequence alignments for these opossum gene products with human ces isozymes demonstrated considerable conservation of key residues involved in catalysis, organelle localization, quaternary structure and ligand binding, and retention of the α-β secondary structures previously reported for human ces <dig>  <cit> . a phylogenetic study was conducted using the opossum ces sequences and amino acid sequences for other vertebrate ces isozymes. the pattern and timing of the ces gene family radiation suggests that a number of gene duplication events occurred prior to the appearance of mammals  <cit> , between 330– <dig> mya generating ancestral genes for ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig>  ces <dig> and ces <dig> in the common ancestor of marsupial and eutherian mammals. further gene duplications for ces <dig> occurred in the lineage leading to modern marsupials, resulting in three ces2-like genes within a  <dig> kb region on opossum chromosome  <dig>
