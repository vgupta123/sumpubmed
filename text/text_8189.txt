BACKGROUND
cancer progression is associated with mutation and differential gene expression  <cit> . many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes responsible for cancer are linked to mutations  <cit> . besides these mutations, recent studies correlate epigenetic features to play an important role in cancer development and propagation  <cit> . epigenetics refers to all gene modifications except the change in the dna sequence  <cit> . these modifications are caused by changes in the chromatin structure  <cit> , dna methylation, and histone modifications. nearly 50% of human genes are associated with cpg islands in the promoter regions  <cit> . if these promoter regions undergo methylation, they lead to disease progression  <cit> . dna methylation occurs in and out of cpg islands, which in a normal tissue is entirely unmethylated at all stages of development and allows gene expression if a transcription factor  is present  <cit> . these changes affect the binding of transcription factors  to dna  <cit> . this occurs by dna methylation of the 5′-cg-3′ pair usually observed at the transcription regulation sites, which results in silencing or activation of the downstream genes  <cit> .

advances in next-generation technologies have led to identification of genome-wide dna methylations in a large number of disease samples. methylation sites have been analyzed based on clustering with respect to genomic regions, methylation patterns, and common regulatory patterns  <cit> . increased methylation of cpg islands in the promoter regions known as hypermethylation leads to silencing of genes, usually associated with tumor suppressor genes  <cit> , whereas the decreased methylation known as hypomethylation is associated with gene overexpression i.e., activation of oncogenes  <cit> . both hypermethylation and hypomethylation are known to be linked to tumors, autoimmune and other diseases  <cit> . in cancers, many genes are methylated in normally unmethylated promoter cpg islands, eventually influencing transcriptional activity both in early and late stages  <cit> . specific examples of dna methylation role in cancers include hypermethylation of brca <dig> in breast and ovarian cancer  <cit> ; dok <dig> in breast cancer  <cit> ; myod <dig> in hematological neoplasm; apc, hox <dig>  otx <dig> genes in non-small cell lung carcinoma   <cit> ; fen <dig> in breast tumor cells  <cit> ; and hypomethylation of tktl <dig> in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> . literature provides evidence correlating transcriptional activities with methylated genes  <cit> , suggesting the role of higher methylation in lowering the transcriptional activity  <cit> . since these epigenetic alterations are reversible, identification of methylated genes for targeted modifications in cancer can provide a new approach to successful drug therapies.

lung cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers in united states. lung cancer is morphologically divided into nsclc and small cell lung cancer   <cit> . nsclc is classified into three major histopatholgical subtypes: adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma. lung adenocarcinoma  is currently the most common of the lung cancers in both smokers and non-smokers. luad is classified into four stages: stage i, when the cancer is localized; stage ii, when the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes; stage iii, when the cancer has spread to tissues near the lungs; and, stage iv, when metastasis has occurred  <cit> . few dna methylation studies have been reported for nsclc, and the dna methylated genes identified in these were apc, cdh <dig>  cdkn2a, dapk, hmlh <dig>  hox, otx <dig>  hox <dig>  zic <dig>  and rassf <dig> <cit> . there have been no stage-wise methylation studies reported on luad. it has been observed that luad is highly heterogeneous, and there is less similarity between stages and across the samples within the stages  <cit> , therefore understanding dna methylated genes profile across luad can provide a new insight.

the aim of the study was to elucidate the dna methylation patterns across different stages of luad from publicly available data resources. we used the cancer genome atlas data  as our resource for methylation data. in this study, a systems biology approach of integrating gene-expression, dna methylation and protein-protein interaction data for finding highly important dna methylated genes across stages of luad were developed. these dna methylated genes were compared across stages for their uniqueness and commonality to identify the patterns across stages of luad. these patterns were then validated and ranked for their importance in luad using literature evidences  <cit> . these ranked patterns were analyzed as potential targets of luad. the limitation of the study was the laboratory validation of the targets and availability of datasets in the tcga. to our knowledge this is the first study that explains the dna methylated genes across stages of luad.

RESULTS
the objective of this study was to understand the significant dna methylated genes across the four stages of luad and analyze them as potential targets. the tcga data associated with luad was classified based on these stages. for this stage-wise data, the patient’s age ranged from 58– <dig> with few outliers. the significant expressed genes and significant dna methylated genes were identified based on the p-values and beta-values for each stage as described in the methodology. resampling technique were performed for the correction and these provided the set of p-values. using the technique used in paper  <cit> , p-value of  <dig>  was obtained from q-values. using this cutoff the significant dna methylated genes were re-evaluated and overlap between the previous and resampled results were calculated. a substantial amount of overlap between old and new set of significant dna methylated genes were observed. additional file  <dig> shows the p-value correction for original and corrected stage i data after resampling. the significant dna methylated genes were then further classified as hypermethylated and hypomethylated . table  <dig> lists the statistics for each stage.

the significant dna methylated genes were compared across stages as shown in figure 1a. from the venn diagrams of figure 1a it can be seen that the maximum number of significant dna methylated genes were identified in stage iii and minimum in stage i.

as shown in figure 1a, there were  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes across all stages. additionally  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes were identified between stages i and iii, and  <dig> were identified between stages ii and iii. figure 1b and 1c shows the distribution of hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes across stages. of the  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes between stages i and iii,  <dig> were was hypermethylated in both stages. on comparing with stage ii, it was observed  <dig> hypermethylated genes in stage i were hypomethylated in stage ii and  <dig> of these were then hypermethylated in stage iii. from figure 1c it can be stated that maximum number of hypomethylated genes were identified in stage ii. similar to hypermethylated genes, no genes maintained the same hypomethylation profile across the three stages. of the four common hypomethylated genes between stages i and iii, two were identified as hypermethylated in stage ii. this suggests that genes in stage ii may have different patterns from those of stages i and iii. table  <dig> lists the common significant dna methylated genes across and between stages.

identification of highly scored significant dna methylated genes
the significant dna methylated genes were analyzed and ranked based on their beta-values. table  <dig> lists the top  <dig> hyper/hypomethylated genes across stages in descending order of their beta-values. as shown in table  <dig>  ten of the top significant dna methylated genes in stage i was stage common across the three . of these  <dig>  seven: ajap <dig>  atp8a <dig>  hoxa <dig>  ptgdr, six <dig>  tlx <dig>  tmem <dig> were hypermethylated, and the three: krtap8- <dig>  mmp <dig> and reg3a were hypomethylated. three of the seven  genes: ajap <dig>  tlx <dig>  ptgdr were also identified in stage iii. interestingly the three top scored hypomethylated genes in stage i was identified as top scored hypermethylated in stage ii. in addition, some of the top scored dna methylated genes were common across two stages only : ly <dig> was the top scored hypomethylated gene and top scored hypermethylated in stage i and ii respectively. while hoxa <dig>  hoxd <dig>  krtap15- <dig>  lep, and nkx6- <dig> were identified as common across stage ii and iii . table  <dig> also identified unique top scored significant dna methylated genes. tables  <dig> and  <dig> have large number of significant dna methylated genes common among them.

significant dna methylated genes in and outside of cpg islands, promoter regions, transcription factors, chromosomes and pathways
the hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes were further analyzed with respect to their methylation inside and outside of the cpg islands. table  <dig> gives the profile of this distribution. from this table, hypermethylated genes in stages i and iii and hypomethylated genes in stage ii were mostly identified in true cpg sites. of the  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes across all stages ,  <dig> were identified in true cpg sites: ajap <dig>  atp8a <dig>  cyyr <dig>  evx <dig>  ferd3l, grik <dig>  grm <dig>  hand <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  hoxd <dig>  otx <dig>  prac, phox2a, pou4f <dig>  ptgdr, six <dig>  slc6a <dig>  spag <dig>  tbx <dig>  tmem <dig>  tlx <dig>  and znf <dig>  these common genes were hypermethylated in stages i and iii respectively but hypomethylated in stage ii. additionally, nine hypermethylated genes common to stages i and iii  were identified in true cpg sites: galr <dig>  hla-g, hoxa <dig>  hoxd <dig>  nid <dig>  npy, pax <dig>  sox <dig>  and vipr <dig>  the hypomethylated genes which were common to stages i and ii, reg3a, mmp <dig> and krtap8- <dig>  were also identified in true cpg sites. the cpg sites were analyzed for their role as promoter sites. this analysis identified 61/ <dig>  80/ <dig> and 141/ <dig> significant dna methylated genes across stage i, ii and iii respectively in promoter sites. also, the common significant dna methylated genes across all stages and between two stages  were identified in the promoter sites. methylation of promoter regions in the gene correlate with low or no transcription  <cit> . gene ontology was used to correlate the transcription role of the significant dna methylated genes identified in all of the three stages. recall from table  <dig> that there are  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> significant dna methylated genes found in stages i, ii and iii respectively of these  <dig> were identified as tfs. among the  <dig> common genes across stages identified in table  <dig>   <dig> were identified as tfs. these  <dig> tfs were found to be hypermethylated in stages i and iii, and hypomethylated in stage ii. figure  <dig> describes the tf distribution profile across the different stages. analysis of these tfs with respect to their cpg sites also identified all  mapped to the true cpg sites.

figure 3a and 3b show the chromosome profile of significant dna methylated genes with respect to their hyper and hypomethylation. as shown in figure 3a for stage i the maximum number of hypermethylated genes were present on chromosome  <dig> while no hypermethylated genes were present on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the stage i genes identified on chromosome 7: evx <dig>  ferd3l, hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  npy, tbx <dig> and tmem <dig> were common in stages i and iii; five of these were common across all stages . for stage ii, the maximum number of hypermethylated genes was present on chromosome 8: mx <dig>  krtap8- <dig> and krtap15- <dig>  of these three, krtap8- <dig> was common across all the stages, and krtap15- <dig> common across stages ii and iii . in stage iii, all chromosomes had atleast one gene identified as hypermethylated. as with stage i, in stage iii also the maximum number of hypermethylated genes was identified on chromosome 7: cftr, dgki, epo, evx <dig>  ferd3l, hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  lep, nptx <dig>  npy, tbx <dig>  tmem <dig> and vipr <dig>  of these genes five were common across all stages, three were common to stages i and iii; two were common to stages ii and iii; and two in only stage iii .

figure 3b shows stage ii has a maximum number of hypomethylated genes on chromosome  <dig> also no hypomethylated genes were identified on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> for this stage. for stage i, only one hypomethylated gene was identified in chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  for stage iii, maximum number of hypomethylated genes was present on chromosome 1: cd1b, fcrl <dig>  flg, ivl, lce1f, lce2b, lce3d, lce4a, spta <dig> and zp <dig>  also, these  <dig> hypomethylated genes on chromosome  <dig> were unique to stage iii.

additional file  <dig> shows the pathway distribution of significant dna methylated genes across stages. this distribution depicts difference and commonality across stages in terms of pathways. the pathways associated with common significant dna methylated genes given in table  <dig> across all stages were inositol phosphate metabolism, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, phosphatidylinositol signaling system and p <dig> signaling. the pathways associated with common significant dna methylated genes  across stages i and ii were glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, melanogenesis, taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, p.e.coli infection, shigellosis, toll-like receptor, calcium signaling pathway and gnrh signaling pathway. the pathways associated with common significant dna methylated genes  across stages ii, and iii was adipocytokine signaling pathway, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, jak-stat signaling pathway, p <dig> signaling pathway. the pathways associated with common significant dna methylated genes across  stages i and iii were antigen processing, cell adhesion molecules, natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity, type i diabetes mellitus. in addition, focal adhesion pathway was associated with stage ii genes and hedgehog pathway with stage iii genes.

network construction and analysis
a systems biology approach was developed to understand the significant dna methylated genes and significant expressed genes in each stage. the interactions for the significant dna methylated genes and significant expressed genes were identified using biogrid  <cit>  and stage-specific networks were constructed. table  <dig> shows the number of interactions of significant dna methylated genes across the three stages. in each stage, the interactions of significant dna methylated genes were analyzed with respect to significant expressed genes. this analysis showed that significant dna methylated genes have interactions among themselves, with significant expressed genes and additional genes present in biogrid  <cit> . these additional genes were analyzed for their expression in all the stages to determine if dna methylation affected their expression. these interactions were termed as “missing links”, and the additional genes as “novel genes”. table  <dig> gives the profile of the missing links and novel genes. analysis of the  <dig> novel genes in stage i for their significance in other stages indicated six of them in stage ii: anxa <dig>  apbb1ip, mdk, pfdn <dig>  tinf <dig>  tle2; three in stage iii: cul <dig>  ctnnb <dig> and sqstm <dig> and six in stages ii and iii: calm <dig>  ctnnb <dig>  c-jun, smad <dig>  tinf <dig>  of the  <dig> novel genes in stage ii, two were associated in stage iii: a2m and ctnnb1i; and ten genes in stages i and iii: foxa <dig>  hk <dig>  ncf <dig>  nrip <dig>  pdlim <dig>  sp <dig>  sumo <dig>  tcf <dig>  tlr <dig>  and tnn. analyses of the  <dig> novel genes in stage iii found three in stage i: eln, fas and tex11; seven in stage ii: anxa <dig>  apbb1ip, mdk, pfdn <dig>  stat <dig>  tle <dig>  ube2b and  <dig> in stages i and ii:bcr, dlg3m, dlg <dig>  egfr, dsp, maff, pick <dig> etc. table  <dig> shows the profile of interaction of significant dna methylated genes identified in table  <dig> and table  <dig> with novel genes analyzed in this paragraph .

figure  <dig> shows the stage-specific networks of significant dna methylated genes. from this figure, it can be seen that stage iii networks were more connected and dense as compared to other two stage networks. this suggests heterogeneity of luad network across stages. to compare stage-specific networks, subnetworks of significant dna methylated genes were identified and analyzed. seed and expand algorithm  was used to identify these subnetworks. additional file  <dig> lists the number of subnetworks with respect to the pathway class. these subnetworks were overlapping as the genes in them belonged to different pathway class. additional file  <dig> shows that the number of subnetworks drastically increases from size four to size five in most of the stages, making it an np-hard problem. this sharp increase in the number of subnetwork suggests that though the dna methylated gene is not directly connected to a hub node, its interaction path has a hub node. this further indicates that a dna methylated gene can influence the whole network of a given stage. table  <dig> lists the subnetworks with greater number of connections identified in all three stages. as shown in table  <dig>  ubc and cul <dig> were identified as hub gene across the three stages and their connectivity profile changes with pathway class. the other hub genes  identified in stages i and iii  were: sirt <dig> , cdk <dig> , pms <dig> , sumo <dig> , smad <dig> , smad <dig> , and smad <dig> . the analysis also identified ly <dig> subnetwork in stage i consisting of the hub gene tlr <dig> interacting with seven other genes. though ly <dig> was also identified in stage ii, the comparative subnetwork was smaller, and this gene was not identified at all in stage iii. hla-g was present in stage i but not in stage ii; therefore its subnetworks were missing. in stage ii and iii, c-jun a tf was identified as a hub gene. phox2a was the significant dna methylated gene associated with c-jun in both stages. there was similarity across common genes  with table  <dig>  depicting that subnetworks constructed out of common genes across or between two stages can be of significance to luad. the size four subnetworks were further compared across the stages to understand their commonality and uniqueness . this size four subnetworks were analyzed for their common significant dna methylated genes. the common significant dna methylated genes in this size four subnetworks were foxg <dig>  and phox2a  and significant expressed genes were: foxh <dig>  foxo <dig>  hand <dig>  myc, rb <dig>  smad <dig>  smad <dig>  smad <dig>  and tp <dig>  on analysis of genes in these subnetworks with respect to their pathway classes found some of them to be very specific to a given pathway class. a highly conserved common subnetwork of grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  and grid <dig> was identified across all stages belonging to the other pathway class. of these grik <dig> was significant dna methylated in all the three stages  and grik <dig> in stages i and iii .

analysis of these subnetworks is an np-hard problem because these are large open subnetworks. to reduce the complexity, the subnetworks were ranked based on their nodestrength and edgestrength as given in methodology section. the top ranked, size four subnetworks of each stage  were propagated and compared to identify the largest conserved subnetworks across the stages. this analysis identified a subnetwork of size  <dig> with seven conserved genes: ubc, kras, pik3ca, pik3r <dig>  raf <dig>  braf, rap1a . the g: profiler tool was used for the enrichment analysis on the top ranked subnetwork given in table  <dig> <cit> . this analysis showed that these subnetworks to be enriched with common genes across stages , indicating that commonality across stages of luad can be critical in identifying the target genes. figure  <dig> gives the circos image of the number of hypomethylated and hypermethylated genes and pathways class across chromosomes for each stages of luad.

figure  <dig> and table  <dig> show the comparison results for the interaction networks from biogrid and from the manually curated signaling network. as shown in the table and venn diagram, there is a minimal proportion of overlap between the methylation and expression networks obtained from multiple sources  & ). however, this overlap improves after applying the methylation-expression network integration criteria mentioned in methodology section ). in addition, there is a significant amount of commonality in the subnetworks extracted from networks for biogrid and the manually curated signaling network. the same set of conserved genes  was obtained in these networks except for ubc, which is missing from the resulting subnetwork of signaling network.

discussion
distribution and understanding of significant dna methylated genes across stages
according to table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  the maximum number of significant dna methylated genes were identified for stage iii followed by stage ii and then stage i. none of the genes in stage iv met the filtering criteria; therefore, no genes were identified as dna methylated. from table  <dig>  it can be seen that hypermethylated genes were more prevalent in stages i and iii than in stage ii. though this study identified  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes  across the three stages, most of them have not been reported previously in luad. the hox genes that were common across the three stages are grouped into four hox families, a, b, c, and d; equivalent numbered hox genes  in each family groups  are paralogues. the analysis found hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig>  hoxb <dig>  hoxd <dig>  and hoxd <dig> genes with high methylation value, suggesting these genes play an important role in all stages of luad. these genes are known to be involved in cell proliferation while preventing apoptosis and helping in survival  <cit> . dysregulated behavior of hox genes has been observed in ovarian cancer  <cit> . early stage hoxa <dig> methylation has been identified in lung cancer and used in early detection and prognosis  <cit> . our analysis found hox genes in all stages, with hypermethylation in stages i and iii, hypomethylation in stage ii. while no previous studies have associated the profile of hox genes with stages, though re-appearance was identified and our analysis demonstrated this aspect. another gene identified by our analysis across all three stages was ptgdr, which was highly hypermethylated in stages i and iii . ptgdr has been negatively correlated with smoking  <cit>  and methylated in colon cancer  <cit> , however, prior studies have not investigated its role in luad. pou4f <dig> and tlx <dig> were identified in all three stages, and tlx <dig> was highly methylated in stages i and iii . previous studies have found them as methylated in leukemia and breast cancer respectively  <cit>  but not in luad. overexpression of tbx <dig>  which was also identified in this study , has been reported in lung cancer  <cit> . evx <dig> and otx <dig>  were identified as methylated in nsclc and lung cancer  <cit> . mmp <dig> has been associated with tumor development, invasion and metastasis of nsclc but its methylation profile was not reported  <cit> , our analysis showed it to be highly hypomethylated in stage ii . there was no literature evidence about kptap8- <dig>  reg2a, and slx <dig> for their significance or methylation in lung cancer.

of the  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes common to stages i and ii, ly <dig> has been previously associated with lung cancer  <cit> ; znf <dig> and lvrn have been identified as methylated in lung cancer  <cit>  and renal carcinoma, but not in luad  <cit> . ly <dig> was highly hypomethylated in stage i and hypermethylated in stage ii , suggesting further investigation into its role in luad.

of the  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes across stages ii and iii, grik <dig> and neurog <dig> have been previously reported being dna methylated biomarker for lung squamous cell carcinoma  <cit> , and a stage i biomarker in lung cancer  <cit>  respectively. however, re-appearance of neurog <dig> in stage iii has not been previously reported. serpinb <dig> and tal <dig> have been identified as methylated in nsclc  <cit> . lep has been reported as biomarkers in breast cancer  <cit> , though not in lung cancer. the other highly hypermethylated genes across stages ii and iii identified in this study  were ajap <dig>  hoxb <dig>  mmp <dig>  nmur <dig>  reg3a, tlx <dig>  etc. and hypomethylated genes were fcrl <dig>  grik <dig>  htr2c, ivl, nkx6- <dig>  etc. literature validation of these genes with respect to their importance in luad and other cancers found nmur <dig> to be overexpressed in pancreatic cancer  <cit> , ajap <dig> epigenetically silenced in glioblastoma  <cit> . also, ajap <dig> was correlated with susceptibility in lung cancer  <cit> . grik <dig> was correlated with breast cancer and being considered as diagnostic for lung cancer  <cit> . not much literature evidence has been reported for the presence of vsx <dig>  nkx 6– <dig> in cancer or their methylation.

of the  <dig> common significant hypermethylated genes unique to stages i and iii, galr <dig>  nid <dig> have been identified as highly methylated in nsclc  <cit> , pax <dig> has been identified in lung cancer but not reported with methylation  <cit> , though pax family genes have been previously reported being methylated in cancer  <cit> . recent studies have reported sox <dig> methylation in lung cancer  <cit> , but not at the stage level. additionally low expression of gas <dig> has been reported in lung squamous cell carcinoma suggesting its importance as marker  <cit> , but this gene has not been previously found to be methylated in luad but reported as methylated in colorectal cancer  <cit> .

of the four significant hypomethylated genes in stage i and iii, in addition to kratap8- <dig> and mmp <dig> which were analyzed in the above section, coro <dig> was also hypomethylated and has been reported as an epigenetic gene in renal cell carcinoma but not in luad  <cit> . however, not much detail for reg3a with regards to its presence in luad was available.

in addition to genes that were found to be common across all or two stages, several genes were unique to one stage only, and these need further evaluation. from stage i, nefm has been reported as a biomarker and as a methylated gene in cancer  <cit> , however, it was not reported in luad. from stage iii, ivl has been identified as overexpressed in cancer  <cit>  but not in luad. overall our methodology identified both known and novel dna methylated genes that were significant across all three stages of luad. also, our analysis found that most of the dna methylated genes that were common across all stages were highly methylated in the respective stages , and many of them were reported as oncogenes.

distribution of the significant dna methylated genes in and outside of cpg islands, promoter regions, transcription factors, chromosomes and pathways
our initial distribution analysis found that most of the significant dna methylated genes across the three stages were present in the true cpg sites , stating the role of these sites in methylation. in stage iii,  <dig> hypomethylated genes were present in false cpg islands. the false sites could be further validated using other databases or clinical features. the analytic procedure in this analysis identified  <dig> of the  <dig> common significant dna methylated genes  and  <dig> unique hypermethylated stage iii genes in the promoter regions. this correlation of the promoter region with common significant dna methylated genes further demonstrates that the genes with higher cpg islands in the promoter region were methylated across the stages of luad. therefore, further analysis can be done to better understand these promoter regions functionally with respect to their conservation  as these can be co-regulated.

dna methylation is closely linked with gene regulation, particularly with transcriptional activity. it has been reported that dna methylation can prevent gene activation and restrict expression for correct developmental stage  <cit> . it can also interfere with binding of tfs by changing the recognition sites involving cytosine  <cit> . most tfs require cpg-rich sites to bind to dna and methylation of these sites might interfere with the bindings. this study identified tfs in all three stages and these tfs were associated with true cpg sites. as tfs have been identified as potential biomarkers for different diseases, the unique tfs identified for each stage were analyzed for their significance in luad using the literature. of the  <dig> tfs common across the stages, four  have already been discussed in earlier sections. table  <dig> lists the significance of the remaining few common and unique tfs across the stages with respect to their association in lung cancer, other cancer  and/or prognostic value. from this table, it can be seen that almost all the tfs are considered as prognostic markers for lung cancer. our study identified these tfs as epigenetically modified across the stages of luad, and, given their significance in cancers , they could be considered for future studies as potential targets for luad.

unique tfs in stage iii 
earlier studies have reported chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> to play an important role in lung cancer  <cit>  also certain chromosomal regions were more hypermethylated  <cit> . on mapping, the hypermethylated and hypomethylated genes to their respective chromosomes, it was observed that some chromosomes were common across all the three stages . chromosome  <dig> was identified in all three stages, with the maximum number of hypermethylated genes in stages i and iii. six common significant dna methylated genes of table  <dig> were identified on chromosome  <dig> including the hox genes which cluster on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  our analysis found chromosome  <dig> to be highly epigenetically modified. some of the other methylated genes located on this chromosome found in the stages i and iii were evx <dig>  ferd3l, npy, tbx <dig>  and vipr <dig>  npy was found to be highly expressed in prostate carcinomas  <cit>  while the significance of the others genes was discussed in the previous section. another significant dna methylated gene common across stages ii and iii  identified on chromosome  <dig> was lep. this gene is known to be associated with advanced lung cancer . genes on chromosome  <dig> have also been reported to associate with different cancers including gastric cancer, and prostate cancer  <cit> . chromosome  <dig> genes akt and pten are used as prognostic markers for nsclc  <cit> , suggesting that chromosome  <dig> genes that have been identified across stages of luad as methylated can be considered for prognostic significance in luad. our analysis also found chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> to be associated with a large number of hypermethylated genes in stages i and iii. chromosome  <dig> has been previously studied and associated with nsclc  <cit> . chromosome  <dig> has been associated with genetic variation in lung cancer  <cit> . in stage iii chromosome,  <dig> was identified with nine hypermethylated genes and these were: lbx <dig>  nkx6- <dig>  ptf1a, slc18a <dig>  sorc <dig>  spag <dig>  c10orf <dig>  and c10orf <dig>  the ladybird homeobox  <dig>  gene has been associated with the breakpoint regions involved in t-cell leukemia  <cit>  and methylated in prostate cancer  <cit> . however, not much has been studied and reported about lbx <dig> methylation and association in lung cancer. similarly nkx6- <dig> is a methylated biomarker for bladder cancer but its importance and methylation has not been studied in luad  <cit> .

the analysis found that chromosomes with the highest number of hypermethylated genes in stage i also had the highest number of hypomethylated genes in stage ii and eventually have the highest number of hypermethylated genes in stage iii . also in stage ii a large number of hypomethylated genes were identified in almost all the chromosomes. this observation suggests a distinct methylation pattern across the three stages of luad, and since methylated genes are present on certain chromosomes in cancer, further indicating that epigenetics plays an important role in luad.

the pathway analysis depicted the onset of different epigenetically modified pathways across stages. the common signaling pathway identified across the three stages shown in additional file  <dig> was: adipocytokine signaling and phosphatidylinositol signaling; across stages i and ii were: toll-like receptor, calcium signaling, gnrh signaling pathway; across stages ii and iii were: jak-stat and p <dig> signaling pathways. it has been reported that genes silenced due to promoter methylation were mostly tumor suppressor genes  <cit> , and silencing of these genes can eventually affect all the pathways especially cell cycle, dna repair genes, apoptosis, signaling etc., which could lead to tumor progression. an example of this propagation was gene ly <dig> which was identified in our analysis as hypermethylated in stage i and hypomethylated in stage ii . in stage i, the interacting genes were tlr <dig>  tlr <dig>  while in stage ii its interacting genes were tlr <dig>  calm <dig> and ubc. ly <dig> encodes md <dig> a molecule important for the activation of tlr <dig>  which promotes survival  <cit>  and toll-like pathways connect to the immune system  <cit> . dna methylation of ly <dig> might prevent the activation of tlr <dig> in stage ii, which in turn would affect the activation of toll-like pathway. since cancer cells evade the immune system, reversing the epigenetic behavior of ly <dig> needs to be further evaluated as it could result in the activation of tlrs which would be beneficial. similar analysis can be carried out for the other pathways that are common across stages as these have also been identified as important cancer signaling pathways  <cit> . in addition, the focal adhesion pathway associated with stage ii has been reported to be involved with multiple signaling events in lung cancer, suggesting that methylation of this pathway might also affect the signaling pathways  <cit> . hedgehog pathways in stage iii have been identified as a subset of nsclc and are being investigated for clinical trials  <cit> . our analysis also found that metabolic pathways are co-related with the dna methylated genes in each stage, underscoring the fact that methylation affects important pathways in luad. our analysis also depicted the early and late methylated affected pathways. this analysis demonstrates that targeting the epigenetic genes in these pathways might be effective for luad.

understanding the dna methylated stage-specific networks
effective drug target identification in a disease now requires incorporating knowledge of the epigenetic genes with knowledge of other biological features. biological networks help understand and elucidate the roles of the molecular entities individually and collectively. therefore, the epigenetically modified genes identified in our study were further analyzed in terms of their interaction partners across different stages of luad. this network analysis can help to recognize patterns that were not visible by exploring the expression data alone and help to illustrate the conserved and unique patterns across the stages of luad. these patterns could then be further validated in laboratories for their efficacy as drug targets.

the missing links and novel genes of table  <dig> were identified in subsequent or other luad stages. these novel genes were analyzed for their interacting partners. table  <dig> shows the common significant dna methylated genes across all stages, having interactions with these novel genes , were: ajap <dig>  foxg <dig>  grik <dig>  hand <dig>  hoxd <dig>  phox2a and prkc. most of these dna methylated genes were analyzed for their significance in the previous sections. analyzing the associations of the novel genes identified the following tfs: c-jun, smad <dig>  stat <dig>  and others genes like egfr, bcr, sumo <dig>  calm <dig>  cul <dig>  ctnnb <dig> etc. the tfs identified as novel for a given stage play an important role in cancers  <cit> . c-jun was identified as important tf in cancer and its subnetwork has been identified in stages ii and iii; which was discussed in the previous section. egfr mutations were associated with nsclc . calm <dig> and ctnnb <dig> were studied in nsclc and lung cancer  <cit> . this brief analysis elucidates that novel genes interacting with epigenetic genes can play an important role in luad; further highlighting that it is essential to understand stage-specific networks.

to understand the commonality and uniqueness of the significant dna methylated genes in the context of the other significant expressed genes, we developed and performed subnetwork analysis . subnetworks of each size were analyzed with respect to their hub genes. table  <dig> shows the hub gene profile across different stages in the size four subnetworks. from this table, it can be seen that ubc and cul <dig> were hub genes across top ranked stage-specific subnetwork; copb <dig>  foxh <dig>  smad <dig>  tlr <dig> for stages i; hdac <dig> for stage ii. also sirt <dig>  sumo <dig>  ly <dig>  c-jun were hub genes in different stages. additionally each subnetwork had at least one tf. this analysis also confirms that epigenetic genes are not usually hub genes, but have a direct correlation with tf. also tfs are usually the hub nodes and play an important role in cancers  <cit> , meaning that targeting dna methylated genes is advantageous as it would not disrupt the whole network but can induce the necessary changes to restore the functionality.

analysis of the genes in the subnetworks  found foxg <dig> and phox2a  to be common across all pathway classes. foxg <dig> is already a signature gene for lung cancer  <cit> . all these subnetworks consisted of at least one tf and these were: hand <dig>  myc, smad <dig>  smad <dig>  smad <dig>  and tp53; which are important in cancer  <cit> . the other genes ar, atf <dig>  cul <dig>  ep <dig>  gata <dig>  lef <dig>  skp <dig> in these subnetworks have also been identified as important in lung cancer  <cit> . our analysis identified the highly conserved common subnetworks of grik <dig>  grik <dig>  grik <dig>  and grid <dig> in the metabolic pathway class. grik <dig> has been reported to be associated with breast cancer and is also in consideration for diagnostic value in lung cancer  <cit> . in addition, the analysis also identified some subnetworks with novel genes . this analysis suggests epigenetic genes can be used to target lung cancer genes and identification of epigenetic subnetworks can aid in stage-wise characterization of luad.

the top ranked subnetworks of size four in each stage were propagated based on their subnetworkstrength to identify the largest conserved subnetwork across stages. analysis of the different subnetworks found that a set of seven genes was conserved across the stages. the size of the subnetworks with these conserved genes was  <dig>  and the seven genes were: ubc, kras, pik3ca, pik3r <dig>  raf <dig>  braf, and rap1a. from table  <dig>  it was seen that ubc was the hub gene in all stages. ubc is considered to be a reference gene for lung cancer, though it interacts with important cancer genes like egfr, pcna, irak <dig>  and p <dig> <cit> . since ubc is involved in ubiquitination, it is responsible for cell death and general maintenance. in this analysis, ubc expression was found in all stages, suggesting that its function if disrupted can result in uncontrolled cell division, a key feature of cancer. the braf gene encodes a ras regulated kinase that mediates cell growth. recent studies have identified braf mutations in nsclc  <cit> . phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase  is a heterodimer that consists of catalytic and regulatory subunits. pik3ca is one of the catalytic subunit genes and pik3r <dig> is one of the regulatory subunit genes: both of these genes were present in the conserved subnetwork. pik3ca mutations have been identified in many cancers. the pik3ca pathway consist of the kras and egfr genes which are important targets for many cancers  <cit> , mutations of pik3ca have been also identified in lung cancer  <cit> . pik3r <dig> expressions have been associated with cancers like glioblastoma and ovarian cancer in prior studies  <cit> , and recent studies have identified pik3r3/akt as the target of lung cancer molecule mir- <dig> which affects tlr <dig> signaling   <cit> . this analysis of the conserved seven genes in the dna methylated genes subnetworks of size  <dig> elucidated that methylation can affect important luad genes and enrichment analysis described the important biological processes associated with these subnetworks. from table  <dig>  it can be seen that these subnetworks affect the important signaling and metabolic cancer processes. additional file  <dig> list the dna methylated genes associated with these subnetworks. therefore, it can be concluded that further laboratory validation of epigenetic genes in these conserved subnetworks might be useful in recognizing a novel target of luad that can be universal to all stages.

effectiveness of methodology to extract significant subnetworks for networks obtained using variable dataset sources is proved by the comparison results showed in table  <dig> and figure  <dig>  in addition, the same set of conserved genes was identified by the algorithm which proves the robustness of the analysis pipeline.

CONCLUSIONS
the study was entirely based on the available tcga data, which has the limitation of unequal samples; still we were able to prove the advantage of integrating epigenetic data, expression data and protein-protein interaction knowledge for advancing of systematic understanding of luad. this understanding can be further improved by incorporating the system biology approach to the epigenetic profile across the different stages of luad. the study identified  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> epigenetic genes across stages i, ii and iii. a set of  <dig> common epigenetic genes were identified across the three stages, and it was observed that methylation patterns were similar across stages i and iii, but were different in stage ii. the study also identified known, and novel epigenetic genes across stages that were important in luad, these genes could be further validated in the laboratory for their scope as targets. the novel epigenetic genes identified were ptgdr, pou4f <dig>  tlx <dig>  and mmp <dig> along with the study identified early and late expression profiles of neurog <dig>  ajap <dig>  and coro <dig> in luad. system biology approach stated that epigenetic genes were not the hub nodes but could still affect the hub genes in the networks, eventually playing a critical role in the disease mechanism. subnetworks of size  <dig> with seven conserved genes across the three stages were literature validated, confirming their importance in luad. therefore, it can be concluded that integrating methylated data with expression data can be useful for comprehending in-depth disease mechanism and for the ultimate goal of better target identification.
