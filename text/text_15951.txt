BACKGROUND
the endoplasmic reticulum  mainly functions in proper protein synthesis and maturation, and transport of the correctly folded molecules. when protein folding or export is perturbed and an excess of misfolded client proteins accumulate in the er lumen , eukaryotic cells activate a homeostatic response with a primarily cytoprotective effect, that is collectively termed the unfolded protein response . the upr triggers a set of signaling cascades for the control of gene transcription and translation programs, which while emanating from the er, requires the nucleus and the golgi apparatus for intracellular signal transduction  <cit> . in mammals, the principal branches of upr signaling are mediated by three er transmembrane stress sensors: perk , ire <dig>  and atf <dig> . under unstressed condition, these sensors are interacting with the chaperone grp <dig>  repressing the signaling pathways  <cit> . upon er stress, grp <dig> is sequestered by unfolded proteins leading to transient and concerted activation of each signaling cascade: perk-mediated eif2α phosphorylation, which mediates general translation attenuation during cellular recovery, perk-derived atf4/atf3/chop pathway, ire-1-derived xbp <dig> mrna splicing and atf <dig> activation . the three latter pathways induce the expression of distinct but overlapping sets of genes involved in both general and er-specific proteostasis  <cit> . simultaneously, a subset of cellular mrnas is translationally silenced by sequestration into discrete cytoplasmic stress granules until stress mitigates or degradation, if er stress persists  <cit> .

staphyloccocal nuclease domain containing protein snd <dig>  is a multidomain protein that appears to have diverse functions in mammalian cells. originally described as a transcriptional coactivator essential for normal cell growth  <cit> , snd <dig> serves multiple functions in biological events spanning from regulation of cell differentiation and proliferation, adipogenesis and biogenesis of lipid droplets to cellular stress responses  <cit> . snd <dig> has been demonstrated to act as both a nuclease and a ligand. the ample distribution of the protein and its capacity for binding rna and protein molecules explain the role of snd <dig> in regulating postranscriptional processes linked to rna splicing, editing and silencing  <cit> . accumulating evidence indicates that snd <dig> plays an important role in rna protection due to its ability to interact with stress granules protein components and to degrade highly mutated, hyper-edited regions of double-stranded rnas generated during the cellular stress response  <cit> . snd <dig> also acts as a microrna  binding protein, having been assigned to bind pre-mir-92a in stress granules and interfere with its maturation under hypoxic conditions  <cit> . the interaction of snd <dig> with mrnas and mirnas may be of notable relevance in cells undergoing a tumor growth-associated stress because of the potential contribution to angiogenesis regulation. so far, the snd <dig> overexpression that occurs in multiple types of cancer cells has been interpreted to mean parallel activation of the rna-induced silencing complex activity and degradation of tumor suppressor mrnas  <cit> .

in the particular case of liver cancer, snd <dig> and nf-κb intersect at several points. snd <dig> has been shown to trigger a novel molecular cascade that, mediated by mir- <dig> and nf-κb activation, leads to induction of angiogenic factors for hepatocellular carcinoma progression  <cit> . we demonstrated in human hepatoblastoma model hepg <dig> cells, that the evolutionary conserved snd <dig> gene promoter is under sp <dig> and nf-y control in basal conditions and under nf-κb functional binding in response to tnfα-mediated inflammatory stress  <cit> . snd <dig> mrna overexpression was also found in tnfα-treated cells  <cit> . collectively, these results support the concept that, in liver carcinoma, there is an intertwined relationship between snd <dig> gene expression and tumour environment inflammation, conditions that are closely linked to er stress. here, we seek to extend the previous knowledge of gene transcriptional regulation and have analyzed the transcriptional response of human snd <dig> gene to pharmacological activation of the upr in human hepatoma cells. tunicamycin inhibits protein n-glycosylation  <cit>  and thapsigargin is an inhibitor of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ca2+-atpase pump that disrupts er calcium homeostasis  <cit> , and both promote accumulation of misfolded or inadequately processed proteins in the er lumen and cause er stress. we present first experimental data indicating that promoter activity and expression of human snd <dig> gene are activated in cells exposed to thapsigargin or tunicamycin and also following ectopic expression of the transcription factor atf <dig>  moreover, we have identified the maximal activation in snd/ <dig>  a promoter region of  <dig> nucleotides upstream the transcription start site that contains several putative er stress response elements  for the binding of transcription regulators atf <dig>  atf and xbp <dig> 

RESULTS
er stress activates snd <dig> gene promoter activity and expression
in light of previous reports showing that snd <dig> participates in a range of stress responses including those associated with cell growth and inflammation, particularly in the liver, and that little is known about the factors controlling snd <dig> gene expression, we investigated the effect of pharmacologic er stress on snd <dig> gene promoter activity in human hepatoblastoma cells. we challenged a human hepatoma cell line, hepg <dig>  with two structurally-unrelated er stress-inducing drugs, tunicamycin and thapsigargin. both drugs have proven useful for delineating the molecular grounds of upr signaling pathways  <cit> . as fang established  <cit> , we probed 1 μm thapsigargin and 5 μg/ml tunicamycin as the best concentrations for inducing er stress in hepg <dig> cells while maintaining cell viability during the 24 h lasting treatment . to investigate the response of snd <dig> promoter activity to these stress inducers, transcriptional activity was measured in hepg <dig> cells transfected with each of the six 5’ deletion fragments snd/1-snd/ <dig> of the isolated promoter  that were generated and cloned into the firefly luciferase reporter vector pgl3-basic. the fragments comprised the promoter regions - <dig>  +221; - <dig>  +221; - <dig>  +221; - <dig>  +221; - <dig>  + <dig> and - <dig>  + <dig>  findings revealed that the activity provided by each luciferase reporter construct increased upon cell exposure to tunicamycin or thapsigargin with rises that oscillated between 50% and 90% depending on the construct . maximal activation was detected in fragment snd/ <dig>  which covers the promoter region - <dig> upstream the transcription start site.figure  <dig> 
activation of human snd <dig> gene promoter activity and expression by endoplasmic reticulum stress. a) hepg <dig> cells were transfected with a luciferase reporter gene driven by six different constructs of the human snd <dig> gene promoter snd/1- <dig> and used 24 hours later. cells were incubated with 5 μg/ml tunicamycin  or 1 μm thapsigargin  or the corresponding vehicle  2 hours before transfection. luciferase activity was calculated using a dual luciferase assay and expressed as fold increase relative to the activity of the snd/ <dig> fragment in control cells as described in methods. b) levels of snd <dig> mrna were determined by quantitative real-time pcr in treated and non-treated hepg <dig> cells and expressed as relative units, setting to  <dig>  the value for control cells. c) snd <dig> and chaperones grp <dig> and grp <dig> protein expression was determined by western blotting using β-tubulin as a loading control and expressed as relative units, setting to  <dig>  the value for control cells. data are presented as mean ± sd from at least three independent experiments. * p <  <dig> , ** p <  <dig> , *** p <  <dig> .



to examine whether the response of promoter transcriptional activity to er stressors was paralleled by increases in the expression of snd <dig> at the level of mrna and protein, quantitative real-time pcr and western blot analyses were performed in untreated and er stress inducers-treated cells. tunicamycin led to a significant  <dig> -fold increase in the snd <dig> mrna level  and  <dig> -fold increase in the amount of snd <dig> protein . however, whereas there was a  <dig> -fold increase in the snd <dig> mrna level  in thapsigargin treated cells, no change in snd <dig> protein levels were observed . these findings suggest that each specific form of er stress promotes differential responses on snd <dig> translational programs.

the well-established rise in protein levels of the er marker chaperones grp <dig> and grp <dig> was used as a surrogate index of the induction of er stress. we found that the protein levels of chaperone grp <dig> in tunicamycin- or thapsigargin-treated cells reached values over  <dig> and  <dig> times higher than those measured in control cells . however, the rise in grp <dig> protein was higher in thapsigargin-  than in tunicamycin- treated cells  . these findings suggest that the thapsigargin-induced er calcium loss of homeostasis  <cit>  and the tunicamycin-induced protein n-glycosylation blockage  <cit>  result in activation of the upr branches of differential intensities, perhaps through accessory interactions, which might condition the selective induction of gene expression and mrna translation attenuation and stress granules formation  <cit> . despite this, our findings unambiguously indicate that activation of snd <dig> gene promoter may be considered one of the processes of cellular adaptability to stressful conditions in hepg <dig> cells. the finding that snd <dig> protein is overexpressed in tunicamycin-treated but not in thapsigargin-treated cells suggest that the newly transcribed snd <dig> mrna may be fully translated when protein glycosylation is impeded but this protein synthesis is inhibited by thapsigargin-induced er stress. the latter is not an unexpected finding, in view of that calcium in the er is required for the initiation of protein synthesis in almost all mammalian cell types, and thapsigargin has been demonstrated to sharply and irreversibly suppress amino acid incorporation within hepg <dig>  <cit> . it is conceivable that the primary effect of er stress is to promote snd <dig> gen activity and that snd <dig> protein outcomes depend on the nature, intensity and duration of the stress for fine-tuning the cellular response, with snd <dig> translation arrest operating when certain er functional circumstances associated to serious degrees of stress are imposed on the cells.

ectopic expression of atf <dig> activates snd <dig> promoter activity
to further study the stress-induced activation of the snd <dig> transcriptional activity, we evaluated the potential role of the transcription factor atf <dig> on snd <dig> promoter activity. atf <dig> is initially synthesized and retained by grp <dig> in the er. upon er stress, atf <dig> is released from grp <dig> and deliver to the golgi apparatus where it undergoes proteolytic processing, and the liberated n-terminal cytosolic fragment atf <dig> moves then into the nucleus to activate target genes  <cit> . for that, plasmid-mediated ectopic expression of full-length atf <dig> was induced in hepg <dig> cells transfected with each of the six 5’ deletion fragments of the snd <dig> promoter and luciferase activity was measured and compared with that shown by mock transfected cells expressing basal levels of atf <dig>  we observed that luciferase activity of the snd/ <dig>  snd/ <dig>  snd/ <dig> and snd/ <dig> promoter fragments was either unaffected or minimally activated by atf <dig> expression . however, transcriptional activity of the snd/ <dig> fragment increased by 100% in pcgn-atf <dig> transfected hepg <dig> cells as compared with that measured in mock transfected cells . notably, not only the percentage of increase was similar to that caused in the promoter fragments activity by cell exposure to thapsigargin or tunicamycin, but also maximal activation was consistently detected in the snd/ <dig> construct covering the promoter region  . bioinformatic analysis revealed that region snd/ <dig> contains all the potential motives for atf <dig> and xbp <dig> binding identified by tess  <cit> , jaspar  <cit>  and matinspector  <cit>  tools along the proximal promoter sequence of snd <dig> gene , with the exception of atf at position - <dig> . atf <dig> can bind to several cis-acting response elements, namely, erse , erse-ii , and upr element   <cit> . atf <dig> has been identified as the ccacg-binding protein while the general transcription factor nf-y constitutively occupies the ccaat/attgg part of erse and erse-ii  <cit> . in previous studies, we demonstrated that the human snd <dig> promoter lacks tata box and contains gc boxes and two inverted ccaat boxes for the functional binding of sp <dig> and nf-y, respectively  <cit> . we also demonstrated that nf-y binding at positions - <dig> and - <dig> within the proximal promoter is crucial for the basal transcription of snd <dig> gene  <cit> . these nf-y binding sites are located quite far from the predicted stress response elements to be considered as a part of them according to in silico analysis. however, it has to be considered that the erse motives can be recognized by xbp <dig> and other transcription factors members of the creb/atf and ebox/atf subfamilies and the basic-region leucine zipper family  <cit> . therefore, more work will be required to identify which of the transcription factors, atf <dig> or xbp <dig> or others, and how they act to regulate the activation of snd <dig> promoter, and to better characterize the branch of the upr governing the expression of snd <dig> gene.figure  <dig>

the impact of each upr branch on liver function in pathologic states has been discussed by malhi and colleagues, who described the existence of a variety of crosstalks between er stress, inflammatory response and activation of nf-κb in which atf <dig> and xbp <dig> signaling are involved  <cit> . we have recently demonstrated that snd <dig> promoter transcriptional activity increases in response to tnfα-induced inflammatory stress via binding of nf-κb transcription factor at positions - <dig> and - <dig>  <cit> . upon such inflammatory stress, a 14-fold induction in the er chaperone grp <dig> has been measured in tnfα-treated cells as compared with a negative control  supporting the occurrence of perturbations in the er functional status that could be modulating snd <dig> gene transcription. nevertheless, since atf <dig> does not substantially affect activity in snd/3- <dig> and nf-κb mediates its action through - <dig> and - <dig> binding sites, snd <dig> gene expression activation by these agents might be well orthogonal.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, though the exact function of snd <dig> in mammals is yet to be revealed, our findings identify er stress as a previously unappreciated up-regulating factor for snd <dig> gene expression . we encounter for the first time a direct response of snd <dig> gene promoter activity to pharmacological er stress and the potential participation of atf <dig> in the er stress-associated transcriptional activation of the human snd <dig> gene.figure  <dig> 
scheme illustrating endoplasmic reticulum  stress-mediated activation of snd <dig> promoter activity. snd <dig> is an er stress target gene. the three families of signal transducers ire <dig>  perk and atf <dig> sense the protein folding conditions of the er and transmit that information, resulting in production of transcription regulators that enter the nucleus to drive transcription of upr target genes. the er chaperone grp <dig> is normally bound to these er stress sensors and keeps them inactive. by blocking protein n-glycosylation and disturbing ca2+ homeostasis in the er, tunicamycin and thapsigargin promote accumulation of misfolded proteins that sequester grp <dig>  leading to the concerted activation of the three stress sensors, which work alone or together to activate upr target genes. simultaneously, mrna translation is globally inhibited and a subset of cellular mrnas is translationally silenced by sequestration into stress granules. snd <dig> promoter activity is enhanced by thapsigargin, tunicamycin or ectopic expression of atf <dig>
