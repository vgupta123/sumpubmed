BACKGROUND
mitochondria are dynamic organelles undergoing constant changes in size and shape. this perpetual cycle of fusion and fission is a delicate balancing act and is critical for proper cellular function  <cit> . mitochondrial morphology is regulated by the opposing actions of fusion and fission proteins. the central regulators of fusion are the mitofusions . these proteins are necessary to prevent unchecked fission, which can lead to hyper fragmented mitochondria  <cit> . the principal protein responsible for fission is drp <dig> . several groups have specifically linked drp <dig> and excessive mitochondrial fragmentation to neurodegeneration  <cit> . first discovered and characterized in yeast   <cit> , human drp <dig>  was shown to promote mitochondrial fission in human cells  <cit> . drp <dig> is a primarily cytoplasmic protein which, when activated, can form ring-like multimers and translocate to the mitochondria. there, in concert with accessory proteins, drp <dig> facilitates mitochondrial scission  <cit> . drp <dig> activity and cellular localization are highly regulated by post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and n-linked nitrosylation  <cit> . here we characterize the ability of autophagy to regulate protein expression of drp <dig> 

macroautophagy, here referred to as autophagy, is a mechanism of degradation and recycling of proteins beginning with sequestration of cytoplasmic proteins into double-membrane vesicles followed by fusion with the lysosome and subsequent protein degradation. autophagy is initiated by multiple cellular cues including starvation and has extensive roles in numerous cellular processes and pathophysiologic mechanisms  <cit> . first characterized in yeast, autophagy is regulated by a highly conserved family of atg  genes. in mammalian cells, the process can be actuated by mtor inhibition as well as mtor-independent mechanisms. interestingly, elongation of the autophagic membrane involves two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems where atg <dig>  works in conjunction with atg <dig> or atg <dig>  to conjugate atg <dig> to atg <dig> and light chain  <dig>  to phosphatidylethanolamine , respectively. atg7-deficient cells display impaired autophagosome formation and lysosomal protein turnover  <cit> . while the non-pe conjugated form of lc <dig>  is present in the cytoplasm, the pe-conjugated form  is then attached to the autophagosomes and represents a marker for autophagosomes. the autophagosomes then deliver their contents to the lysosome via fusion. experimentally, several chemical inhibitors, including bafilomycin a <dig> and chloroquine, can inhibit this autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion. autophagy specific for mitochondria, termed mitophagy, has also been shown to play an increasingly important role in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics  <cit> .

various lines of evidence point to altered mitochondrial dynamics as an underlying pathologic mechanism contributing to many neurodegenerative conditions including alzheimer’s , parkinson’s , and huntington’s  diseases  <cit> . because of their metabolic requirements, neurons are exquisitely dependent on proper mitochondrial function including appropriate fusion and fission. mutations of the principal proteins responsible for mitochondrial fusion and fission are seen in several neurological disorders. mfn <dig> mutations are seen in patients with charcot-marie tooth neuropathy type  <dig>  <cit> . opa <dig>  a protein responsible for inner mitochondrial membrane fusion, is mutated in autosomal dominant optic atrophy type  <dig>  <cit> . a neonatal lethal mutation in dnm1l, which inhibits proper drp <dig> mitochondrial assembly, was characterized in a patient with microcephaly, abnormal brain development, and optic atrophy  <cit> . several groups have highlighted the importance of drp <dig> function in neurodegeneration  <cit> . in a mouse model of ad, neuronal drp <dig> is upregulated and increased drp <dig> activity is thought to occur in the brains of ad patients, which may contribute to the characteristic pathology  <cit> . in hd, drp <dig> associates with mutant huntington protein altering normal mitochondrial axonal movement  <cit> . in a pd neuroblastoma cell line model, downregulation of drp <dig> protects from the neurotoxic effects of 6-hydroxydopamine  <cit> . work by several groups investigating familial pd, often caused by park <dig> or pink <dig> mutations, shows autophagy serves a neuroprotective role and that autophagy is in part responsible for mitochondrial morphology, additionally these groups have found increased fission these pd model systems  <cit> . together these data support a role of increased drp <dig> and increased drp <dig> activity as a culprit in neurodegeneration. here we characterize a general mechanism of drp <dig> turnover through autophagy. we show that autophagic regulation may be exploited using existing fda-approved compounds to lower drp <dig> levels in neurons.

RESULTS
inhibition of autophagosomal-lysosomal degradation increases drp <dig> levels
to understand how autophagy affects the endogenous levels of drp <dig>  we used bafilomycin a <dig> to decrease autophagic protein degradation. bafilomycin inhibits the lysosomal vacuolar h+ atpase and autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion and is a commonly used inhibitor of autophagic degradation. bafilomycin treatment in hek-293t cells increased the expression of drp <dig> at both  <dig> and 24 hours . to ensure the efficacy of this bafilomycin treatment to inhibit autophagic turnover, levels of lc <dig> were also analyzed, confirming inhibition of autophagosomal-lysosomal fusion with increased lc3-ii levels. to investigate whether proteasomal inhibition would have a similar effect, as previously reported  <cit> , we analyzed the effect of the proteasome-specific inhibitor mg <dig>  treatment with mg <dig> did increase the levels of drp <dig> at 4 hours, although not as dramatically as bafilomycin treatment. these data suggested that although proteasomal-mediated turnover of drp <dig> occurs in these cells, inhibiting autophagic turnover has a more dramatic effect on drp <dig> protein expression levels. to confirm that this is not a bafilomycin-specific effect, treatments with other lysosomal inhibitors, chloroquine  and a combination of the lysosomal protease inhibitors, pepstatin and e64d, were used. at both  <dig> and 24 hours there were increased levels of drp <dig> in chloroquine-treated cells corresponding with increased lc3-ii levels . similarly, the combination of e64d and pepstatin was able to increase the level of drp <dig> protein in hek-293t cells after 24 hours . to determine if this effect is cell line dependent, sh-sy5y were treated with a similar regimen of bafilomycin and mg <dig> . after 24 hours, a comparable increase in drp <dig> level was seen after bafilomycin treatment, a lower level of increase was also seen in the mg <dig> treated cells. the data from the combination of autophagic inhibitors and multiple cell lines together suggest levels of drp <dig> expression are considerably dependent on autophagy.

blocking autophagy increases the mitochondrial fraction of drp1
in order to determine if blocking autophagy is also increasing the levels of the mitochondrially-associated drp <dig>  cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of hek-293t cells treated with bafilomycin were isolated. bafilomycin increased drp <dig> in both the cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction in these cells . to ensure that the increase of drp <dig> was specifically autophagy-mediated we created stable atg <dig> knockdown hek-293t cells. hek-293t cells were transfected with an atg <dig> shrna plasmid and transfected cells were selected with hygromycin. these knockdown cells again demonstrated an increased drp <dig> level after autophagy is perturbed by atg <dig> knockdown . next we selected several different atg <dig> knockdown clones and analyzed the levels of drp <dig> in the mitochondrial fraction by immunoblotting . each of the clones demonstrated an increased drp <dig> level in the mitochondrial fraction. taken together, the results from both the pharmacological and genetic approaches to inhibiting autophagy suggest not only does autophagy regulate overall drp <dig> levels but, autophagy is responsible for the levels of mitochondrially-associated drp <dig>  the cellular pool ultimately responsible for fission.

induction of neuronal autophagy lowers endogenous drp <dig> levels
imbalanced mitochondrial fusion and fission has been well characterized in neurodegeneration  <cit> . increased drp <dig> levels in ad  <cit>  and hd patients  <cit> , and cellular data from pd models all suggest that increased drp <dig> is associated with pathogenesis. with this and evidence for autophagy-mediated turnover of drp <dig> in mind, we studied the possible effect of inducing autophagy in a primary neurons. the compound 10-ncp has been found to potently induce autophagy in primary neurons  <cit> . using cultured e <dig> rat-derived striatal neurons, 10-ncp is able to reduce drp <dig> levels in a dose-dependent manner with a corresponding increase in lc3-ii levels . this effect is also time dependent and drp <dig> is effectively decreased by 24 hours of 10-ncp treatment . the previous study of 10-ncp in neurons also identified several fda-approved structural analogs, which were able to analogously induce autophagy  <cit> . we were interested to see if these compounds would act similarly to 10-ncp in these neurons. both compounds tested  were able to decrease drp <dig> in a similar time dependent manner to 10-ncp . to confirm the functional relevance of drp <dig> downregulation, e <dig> rat-derived striatal neurons were treated with vehicle or 10-ncp along with transduction of a mitochondrially-targeted gfp . it appears that 10-ncp leads to decreased fission as mitochondria become more interconnected after treatment . to quantify this effect, mitochondrial morphology was analyzed using a well-characterized image analysis program   <cit> . after 10-ncp treatments, mitochondrial size is increased in a large percentage of the neuronal mitochondria . to better quantify this effect, the average and distribution of mitochondrial size and length  in control and 10-ncp treated neurons is shown . these data suggest the induction of autophagy in neurons is able to decrease drp <dig> and this approach may be useful to decrease the aberrant drp <dig> expression observed in neurodegeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
drp <dig> is the primary protein responsible for mitochondrial fission and as many groups have shown, increased drp <dig> and increased fission are well characterized in several neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> . in this study we have demonstrated a pathway for drp <dig> autophagic degradation. chemical inhibition of lysosomal degradation and atg <dig> knockdown increased drp <dig> levels. further, activation of autophagy in neurons with multiple compounds, including two that are already fda approved, were able to decrease drp <dig> levels. we demonstrate that drp <dig> protein turnover is not limited to one proteolytic system and there is likely interplay between the autophagic system and the ups in order to finely tune drp <dig> expression. the ubiquitination of drp <dig> by parkin  <cit>  and the ability of parkin to induce both k48- and k63-linked ubiquitin chains  <cit> , certainly hints to the importance of the interaction and balance between these two systems. in our neuronal system however, drp <dig> levels are quite sensitive to induction of autophagy. we hypothesize that the neuroprotective effect of autophagy inducers may in part be due to their ability to reduce drp <dig> mediated mitochondrial fission effectively counteracting the increased fission observed in neurodegeneration.
