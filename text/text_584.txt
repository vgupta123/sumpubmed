BACKGROUND
malaria pathogenesis poses a major hindrance to development in many parts of the world with more than  <dig> million people suffering from the disease and at least one million dying from p. falciparum infection each year  <cit> . disease severity has been associated with the accumulation of infected erythrocytes  in microvasculature of vital organs, such as the brain and placenta  <cit> . a key protein family involved in ie binding is the antigenic variant p. falciparum erythrocyte membrane  <dig>   <cit> . each parasite genome contains about  <dig> var genes that encode pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> , which are expressed in a mutually exclusive fashion at the ie surface  <cit> . switches in var gene expression allow parasites to evade the host antibody response and sequester at different microvascular sites in the body  <cit> . therefore, further definition of the var gene family conservation, the factors regulating variant antigen gene diversification, and the expression of particular var genes during disease will provide critical insights into malaria pathogenesis and aid disease interventions.

var genes have a two-exon structure  <cit> . the first exon is large  and encodes multiple adhesion domains called the duffy binding-like  and cysteine-rich interdomain region . the second exon is smaller  and codes for a more conserved cytoplasmic tail. although pfemp <dig> sequences are highly diverse, the adhesion domains can be grouped by sequence similarity  <cit>  into seven types of dbl domains  and four types of cidr domains  that have been used as criteria for dissecting pfemp <dig> protein domain structures and binding functions.

the pfemp <dig> proteins in the 3d <dig> genome have been arbitrarily classified into one of seventeen different protein architectural types based upon domain composition  <cit>  and divided into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of 5' upstream  sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> . var group a genes have upsa flanking sequences and are located in sub-telomeric regions transcribed toward the telomere, while group b consists of telomeric var genes flanked by upsb sequences that are transcribed toward the centromere, and group c are flanked by upsc sequences and are located in central chromosomal regions. group b/a genes are very similar in location and transcriptional orientation to group b genes, but are located further from the telomere following other var genes or pseudogenes. in contrast, group b/c genes have an upsb-like 5' flanking sequence, but are located in central chromosomal regions. thus, it has been postulated that groups b/a and b/c represent transitional groups between the major groupings  <cit> .

inter-isolate comparisons have also revealed the existence of three unusual genes: var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes, which appear in nearly all parasite isolates  <cit> . these semi-conserved homologs may have important roles in the host-parasite interaction. the pfemp <dig> encoded by var2csa binds the placental adhesion receptor, chondroitin sulfate a , and therefore has a critical role in the pathogenesis of pregnancy associated malaria  <cit> , while no function has yet been ascribed to the proteins encoded by var1csa and type  <dig> var.

the genomic organization of var genes may have an important role in var gene evolution. similar to other variant antigen families, gene recombination or gene conversion between var paralogs may contribute to the rapid evolution of the gene family  <cit> . it has been hypothesized that the frequency of recombination between var genes may depend upon chromosomal location, gene orientation, and homology in the gene flanking sequence. sequence and binding analysis of 3d <dig> var genes indicate that groups b and c pfemp <dig> proteins bind the primary microvasculature receptor  while group a pfemp <dig> proteins do not  <cit> . thus, var gene recombination hierarchies may promote the evolution of pfemp <dig> adhesion groups with different patterns of sequestration and disease. a fundamental question is whether the gene organization observed in 3d <dig> occurs in other parasite isolates and contributes to a general recombination mechanism shaping the variant antigen repertoire.

to investigate evolutionary mechanisms of the var gene family and provide new tools to study the role of pfemp <dig> proteins in mediating cytoadhesion, we have sequenced var genes from isolate it4/25/ <dig> , which has maintained the ability to cytoadhere after in vitro adaptation  <cit> , and compared these genes to the var repertories of the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and of the hb <dig> isolate, for which sequence contigs were recently made available . although there are currently relatively few reports, isolate hb <dig> also maintains cytoadherence in culture  <cit>  and is therefore a useful addition to comparative var analyses.

all three parasites, it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig>  have been cloned in vitro and represent single parasite genotypes. the it <dig> parasite was originally isolated from brazil  <cit> , but is known to have undergone accidental cross-contamination at an early stage of its history after in vitro adaptation  <cit> . the hb <dig> clone was derived from the honduras i/cdc isolate  <cit>  and the nf <dig> parent to the 3d <dig> clone was isolated from an individual who lived near an airport in amsterdam and never left the netherlands  <cit> . based upon genotyping and parasite population studies, it <dig> groups with asian isolates, 3d <dig> groups with african isolates, and hb <dig> represents central america  <cit> .

despite progress in understanding the mechanisms of cytoadhesion and antigenic variation of pfemp <dig>  limited information about the factors regulating variant antigen diversification and the extent of repertoire overlap between parasite isolates exists. most studies have relied on small var sequence "tags" amplified from the first dbl domain in pfemp <dig> proteins  <cit> . the studies presented here represent the first comprehensive analyses of var genes across multiple parasite isolates. these comparisons reveal general principles of var gene organization that have become established across geographically diverse parasite isolates and provide powerful tools to study the cytoadherent and immunogenic properties of pfemp <dig> proteins.

RESULTS
the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates
conservation in the var gene 5' and 3' gene-flanking regions, the semi-conserved exon  <dig>  and other domains allowed us to design a series of primers  and extend it <dig> var tags that we had previously sequenced from the pfemp <dig> dblα, β, γ, and δ domains  <cit> . we sequenced  <dig> full-length var genes and  <dig> partial genes from the it <dig> isolate , in addition to the  <dig> full-length var genes that have been previously characterized . these genes represent all but  <dig> of the  <dig> it <dig> sequence tags identified from other studies  <cit> . in order to estimate the proportion of it <dig> var genes represented by these sequences, we searched the 1× coverage it <dig> genome sequence at the wellcome trust sanger institute  <cit>  for additional var sequences. out of  <dig> reads with sequence similarity to the first exon of any known var genes, only ~15% do not overlap with our data set. assembly of these reads shows that most of the non-overlapping reads represent small sequence fragments no larger than a single read and three partial gene fragments of 3– <dig> kb . thus, the var gene repertoire presented here includes partial or complete sequence for most it <dig> var genes. eight var genes were mapped to specific chromosomes using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and southern analysis  and in some cases, intrachromosomal location  was identified based on apai restriction fragment length  <cit> . the chromosomal locations of a further  <dig> var genes were based on previously published data  <cit> .

analysis of the hb <dig> sequence contigs obtained from the 10× coverage genome sequence at the broad institute <cit>  identified  <dig> var genes that contain a dblα domain as well as two var2csa homologs;  <dig> of the  <dig> var genes are full-length,  <dig> are incomplete and six are pseudogenes containing stops or frame-shifts . examination of 5' and 3' flanking sequences  enabled us to predict the chromosomal location of most genes , although in a number of cases they could not be assigned to specific chromosome ends. these predictions assume that recombination has not changed the arrangement of chromosome ends in hb <dig> and 3d <dig> 

comparisons of the it <dig> and hb <dig> pfemp <dig> protein domain architecture revealed representatives of most classes previously described in 3d <dig>   <cit>  plus fourteen new types . of the  <dig> domain architectures, most types contain only a single representative per isolate and only seven  are found in all three isolates. while five  are found only in 3d <dig>  eight  are unique to it <dig>  and six  to hb <dig> . moreover, the distribution of var genes among the shared domain architecture classes differs substantially between isolates. more than half  of the 3d <dig> var genes have a type  <dig> architecture, but this type of var gene is rarer in it <dig>  and hb <dig> . conversely, it <dig> contains six type  <dig> var genes compared to only one in 3d <dig> and hb3; while hb <dig> contains six representatives of type  <dig>  which is not present in either 3d <dig> or it <dig>  the differential abundance of individual pfemp <dig> types between parasite isolates and the presence of new pfemp <dig> types in isolates it <dig> and hb <dig> indicate considerable inter-strain plasticity in the variant antigen repertoire. despite these differences in gene repertoires, the previously described tandem domain associations  <cit>  are consistently preserved, indicating the potential structural and functional significance of these domain relationships.

abolded protein architectures were detected in all three isolates.

bthese genes were members of the b-st var group.

cthe it <dig> and hb <dig> are partial gene repertoire estimates.

while seven protein architectural types are shared among the three isolates, most var genes have overall amino acid sequence identities of < 50% in individual domains , even those within the same architectural type. however, three var genes  are highly conserved at the sequence level, with > 75% identity over multiple domains. partial gene sequence tags for these three var genes have been amplified from many parasite isolates indicating their unusual conservation for the var gene family  <cit> . however, these isolate-transcendent members can have different copy numbers between parasite isolates. for instance, while 3d <dig> has three copies of the type  <dig> var, we could amplify only one copy in it <dig> and did not find any copies in the genomic sequence from hb <dig>  in addition, hb <dig> contains two var2csa copies rather than one copy as in 3d <dig> and it <dig>  although var1csa is present in all three parasites, it is a truncated pseudogene in 3d <dig>  and the second exon has a frameshift in the hb <dig> allele. also, var1csa is believed to be truncated in many field isolates  <cit>  and has a distinct gene transcription pattern from other var genes  <cit> . therefore it may have a different biological role than other var genes.

sequence comparison of  <dig> – <dig>  kb of 5' flanking sequence from the 3d <dig> var genes has defined five upstream types; upsa, b, c, d, and e types  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequences from the it <dig>  hb <dig>  and 3d <dig> var genes revealed that it <dig> and hb <dig> have similar sequence groupings as 3d <dig> . while we found similar classes as in previous studies, we have sub-divided upsb into four sub-groups  and upsc into two sub-groups . this study also revealed that upsd is very similar to upsa , and that these categories can be more accurately referred to as upsa <dig>  and upsa <dig> . notably, the proportion of var genes in each ups type is similar between isolates .

the 3d <dig> var gene repertoire has been previously categorized into three major  and two intermediate  groups on the basis of ups sequence and chromosomal location  <cit> . the hb <dig> and it <dig> var genes can be similarly assigned to the three major groups on the basis of ups sequence , but differences in chromosomal location between isolates argue for a modification of the sub-groupings. for example, the hb <dig> repertoire contains one upsa1-associated var gene  that is in a central chromosomal cluster rather than the typical sub-telomeric location . therefore, to allow for the future addition of 'atypical' genes, we have developed a naming system based upon var gene location and ups sequence type. the ups types  when known are listed first followed by a chromosome location reference. t, st, and sst refer to the first, second, and third var genes from the telomere respectively and c refers to central var genes. for example, we have now separated var group a into sub-groups a1c, a1st, and a1sst to represent central and sub-telomeric var genes, respectively. similarly, group b is divided to represent var genes with corresponding central  or telomeric  locations. members of the b/a group previously defined by lavstsen et al.  <cit>  are now classified as b1st, b2st, etc. denoting both the 5' upstream type plus a distinct sub-telomeric chromosomal location which follows other var genes or pseudogenes  <cit> .

as observed previously  <cit> , the var gene chromosomal location was highly predictive of 5' gene flanking sequence . for instance, nearly all centromere-transcribed var genes in the telomeric location were upsb <dig> type . in contrast, members of the "transitional" b/c var group located in central chromosomal locations, associate with any of the 5' flanking sequences upsb1- <dig>  interestingly, while hb <dig> contains a copy of the semi-conserved var1csa gene  with the expected upsa <dig> sequence , the hb <dig> isolate is unique in having a second distinct pfemp <dig> protein associated with the upsa <dig> sequence . thus, we have classified both within group a2st. the highly conserved, and sequence divergent, var2csa remains in a separate ups group .

although the general chromosomal distribution of var genes in sub-telomeric regions or central regions on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are similar between the three isolates, the genes themselves are not conserved with the exception of var1csa, var2csa and type  <dig> var. significantly,var genes in the same chromosomal location from the three isolates differ in both sequence and protein architecture . furthermore, the order of var ups types in central var gene clusters differ between isolates . these differences between isolates are evidence of gene recombination that has occurred within the coding and gene-flanking regions.

var gene recombination
to study the genetic relationship of different var genes, we performed repertoire-wide nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparisons using a number of different approaches and visualization tools . the artemis comparison tool   <cit>  was used to visualize regions of similarity identified by reciprocal blastn searches of var exon <dig> nucleotide sequences. using criteria of a word size of 90nt, > 90% identity we observed the gene duplication in 3d <dig>  and identified one gene duplication in hb <dig> . these gene pairs are nearly identical over their entire lengths . these analyses also visualize the semi-conserved var genes  identified above, which have multiple regions of high sequence similarity  between isolates .

act comparisons also identified several instances of partial sequence similarity  between two var genes of the same isolate. selected examples are shown , illustrating the segmental nature of sequence similarity between genes, with only part of each sequence showing a high degree of sequence similarity to the other partner. the 3d <dig> repertoire contains four examples of such "chimeric" gene pairs, the current set of it <dig> var genes has eight, and the hb <dig> repertoire has six . in some cases , a var gene appears to be a "true" chimera of two different var genes , while in other cases the chimeras represent partial duplications between two var genes.

amal8p <dig>  and pfd1235w are duplicated in 3d <dig>  so the match with hb3var <dig> effectively occurs only once.

bthese two genes have a unique upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequence and are the first genes in a chromosome  <dig> central cluster in hb <dig> and 3d <dig>  respectively.

chighlighted rows indicate multiple hits of high sequence similarity, shared between the same gene pairs.

despite geographic separation of 3d <dig>  it <dig>  and 3d <dig>  similar examples of segmental sequence similarity greater than  <dig> bp can be seen between var genes of the different isolates; with five examples between 3d <dig> and hb <dig>  three between hb <dig> and it <dig> and one between 3d <dig> and it <dig> . remarkably, one of the inter-isolate gene pairs, hb3var <dig> and pfl1950w, are both the first var genes in a central cluster on chromosome  <dig> . these two genes have nearly identical and highly distinctive upsb <dig> type 5' flanking sequences  and share approximately  <dig> bp of coding region identity , but otherwise have diverged from one another. this region of similarity identifies a recombination event that likely predates the continental separation of p. falciparum isolates.

these analyses also demonstrate that most var genes share little sequence identity suggesting that the var genes have diverged extensively between parasite isolates and have undergone segmental recombination . however, the patterns of sequence identities are not random in that similarities preferentially occur between members of the same ups group . for instance, upsa <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity with other upsa <dig> genes than with different ups groups and upsb2- <dig> var genes are  <dig> × more likely to share similarity within the upsb2- <dig> group . the same trend holds for gene similarities involving smaller gene segments  <dig> nucleotides and up . an exception is central var genes, which contain "mixed" chimeras of upsb and upsc-associated var genes , suggesting both groups of central chromosome var genes are recombining.

to detect patterns of protein similarities, we conducted "repertoire-wide" dot-plot analyses using concatamers of var exon <dig> sequences ordered by isolate and 5' flanking sequence type. these analyses are designed to detect small windows of sequence similarity  between pfemp <dig> amino acid sequences and clearly show that upsa pfemp <dig> proteins share less similarity with upsb and upsc proteins than with other upsa proteins . conversely, upsb and upsc proteins are indistinguishable in terms of their degree of sequence identity with each other. this analysis combined with the analyses of individual domains  shows approximately as much overall repertoire similarity within as between these geographically diverse strains.

to identify the regions of similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, the dotplot matches were plotted along the length of individual proteins. overall, the dbl <dig> domains in pfemp <dig> proteins tend to have the most similarity between proteins, although there are regions of similarity in some cidr domains . most of the similarity between pfemp <dig> proteins, including between the b and c groups, is associated with semi-conserved homology blocks in dbl domains . these homology blocks correspond to structural elements in solved structures  <cit> . these analyses also clearly illustrate that var2csa and type  <dig> proteins share almost no identity with other pfemp <dig> proteins. curiously, the rosetting-associated it4var <dig> protein is not related to other upsa proteins over most of its length . however, unlike the semi-conserved type  <dig> var or var2csa, hb <dig> and 3d <dig> do not have a var <dig> homolog. although this result suggests that it4var <dig> is not recombining with other var genes, more study is needed to determine its conservation in the parasite population. taken together, these sequence comparisons support the hypothesis that var genes have differentiated into separately recombining groups that may be important to the evolution of the structure and function of pfemp <dig> proteins.

discussion
while the sequencing of the 3d <dig> genome has contributed greatly in determining pfemp <dig> functions and genetic diversity , the associations of var gene repertoires within and between parasite isolates and the factors regulating variant antigen diversification remain largely unknown. to gain understanding into the evolutionary mechanisms shaping the variant antigen repertoire we present here the nearly complete var repertoire of a cytoadhesive laboratory isolate, it4/25/ <dig>  and compare it to the 3d <dig> genome reference isolate and the recently sequenced hb <dig> genome.

despite the enormous diversity of these genes, several features of the var gene family are conserved across isolates including var groupings based upon central or telomeric chromosome location and 5' flanking sequence that may have an important role in the evolution and function of var genes. it has been hypothesized that an original ancestral var gene was duplicated and diverged into the three main var groups  and subsequently into additional transitional groups  <cit> . this interpretation is supported by our analyses showing similar categories of var genes in all three parasite isolates.

based upon sequence comparisons, b and c groups are more similar, even though these genes tend to occupy different chromosomal locations at sub-telomeric and central chromosomal regions, respectively. however, the regions of similarity are predominantly associated with semiconserved homology blocks that are predicted to form the structural scaffolding for the dbl adhesion domains. conversely, the group a genes differ greatly from the b and c groups while the coding region of the three isolate transcendent var genes, var1csa, var2csa, and type  <dig> var genes have unique features and are different from all other var genes. however, these isolate transcendent var genes are more related to the upsa group in that they are sub-telomeric, transcribed towards the telomere, and have 5' gene flanking regions that most resemble the upsa type.

repertoire-wide sequence comparisons show that most gene similarities occur between genes within the same var group, particularly for gene segments larger than  <dig> bp. an exception is central var clusters, which contain both upsb and upsc-associated var genes. while the functional significance of these different 5' promoter types is not completely understood  <cit> , these two sets of central var genes appear to be recombining with each other. taken together, these analyses suggest that var gene recombination preferentially occurs within var groups, with the exception of the semi-conserved var homologs that appear to recombine on their own. further var gene comparisons of parasites undergoing more frequent recombination in nature or parasite crosses will be of interest to determine the relative frequency of intra- versus inter-group gene recombination. these findings provide insight into the mechanisms that generate antigenic diversity in p. falciparum through gene recombination hierarchies, and may have parallels in other variant antigen gene families in plasmodium and other organisms.

the mechanisms of gene recombination/conversion are not well studied in p. falciparum. sequence comparisons and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of parasite crosses and population studies suggest that both small  and larger recombination events contribute to var gene evolution  <cit> . here, we observe that chimeric junction sites are often not "clean" breakpoints and have smaller sections of 90–95% identity  <dig> bp upstream and/or downstream of the central homologous region . this feature may relate to a mechanism of recombination. control of var gene expression has been connected to silence-inducing regulators of gene expression  and chromatin packaging  <cit> . recent studies have shown a possible link between factors involved in transcription regulation  and recombination . it is interesting to speculate that in p. falciparum, factors that are silencing/controlling var gene expression may also be involved in the recombination and gene conversion mechanisms.

from a study of 3d <dig> var genes expressed after antibody selection, it has been hypothesized that group a may contain common antigenic types that are responsible for severe disease  <cit> . although the duplicated 3d <dig> upsa var genes, pfd1235w and mal8p <dig> , have been proposed as a fourth isolate-transcendent variant, termed var <dig>  our analyses do not support this conclusion since a var <dig> homolog was not found in it <dig> or hb <dig>  although the hb <dig> isolate contained a match over a portion of the gene. in addition, var4-like gene fragments were not common in a global survey of parasite isolates using gene-specific primers  <cit> . instead, this observation may represent one of a number of between-genome var chimeras which are not present in all parasite genomes. more study is required to determine which segments of var <dig> are maintained in the parasite population and the extent to which the same segments are shared by different parasite isolates.

more generally, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes and var1csa, the upsa-associated var genes are not highly conserved between the three isolates. this observation reinforces findings of high genetic diversity of upsa-associated dblα tags from a global collection of parasite isolates  <cit> . various factors may influence the stability of large var gene segments across a parasite population, including malaria endemicity, the frequency of mixed infections, or functional selection on that gene segment for binding. the diversity of the upsa var genes suggests that antibody cross-reactivity between different parasite isolates does not necessarily imply the presence of isolate-transcendent var genes, but may be due to cross-reacting antibody epitopes on different pfemp <dig> sequences. although the possibility that a subset of var genes may be associated with severe malaria remains, these genes may not be as conserved across parasite isolates as the pregnancy malaria vaccine candidate var2csa.

the concept of a recombination hierarchy has implications for the evolution of parasite virulence and disease investigation. the conservation of var groupings across isolates raises the possibility that var groups may be diverging and/or evolving in characteristic patterns. for instance, group a var genes, with the exception of the type  <dig> var genes, encode larger proteins with more complex domain compositions and have different protein head structures  from other var groups . in contrast, the relatively small type  <dig> proteins, which consist of four adhesion domains, are not associated with group a in any of the isolates. it has been suggested that immune selection can cause polymorphic antigens to self-organize into sets of non-overlapping variants within a population  <cit> . increased frequency of inter-locus recombination or gene conversion may also act as a homogenizing force leading to the functional and structural specialization of different gene groups  <cit> . interestingly, the proportion of small to larger pfemp <dig> proteins and the distribution of pfemp <dig> architectural types differed between isolates. given the different selective pressures for binding and immune evasion, it may be to the parasite's advantage to have different sets of recombining genes  <cit> . these sets might include genes optimized to promote rapid parasite growth and transmission in the non-immune host, diversified genes that promote parasite transmission and persistence of infection in the face of higher levels of host immunity or organ-specific variants that expand parasite tropism to new host tissues, such as the placenta.

unlike many isolates that have been adapted to in vitro cultivation, the it <dig> genotype stably maintains the cytoadherent phenotype and therefore has become the primary model for this virulence determinant. cd <dig> binding, intercellular adhesion molecule  <dig>  binding, and infected erythrocyte rosetting, or the binding of infected erythrocytes to uninfected erythrocytes, have been shown to reside in multiple different it <dig> pfemp <dig> proteins . although proteins that bind the same host receptor frequently use the same type of binding domain  <cit> , the overall protein architectures are highly distinct. for instance, three icam- <dig> binding pfemp <dig> proteins  all use dblβ c <dig> domains but have different domain structure types and two rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins, r29var  <cit>  and fcrs <dig> var <dig>  <cit>  also have different domain structure types and bind different receptors on the erythrocyte surface. our study completes the sequences for three additional it <dig> var genes upregulated in rosetting parasite clones, which were previously identified by only their dblα tag sequences   <cit> . overall, the rosetting var protein structures are not highly related , although the dbl1α <dig> domain is similar between the upsa-linked r29var and it4var <dig> predicted proteins, which may be significant because dbl1α <dig> is an erythrocyte binding region in r29var  <cit> . in contrast, the other three rosetting-linked var genes  have dblα domains instead of dblα <dig> domains and associate with ups b, c, or unknown ups sequence. while these comparisons suggest that rosetting pfemp <dig> proteins are not restricted to particular var groups, further study is needed to determine whether rosetting proteins in the same var group use a similar constellation of erythrocyte receptors.

CONCLUSIONS
a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for malaria pathogenesis is lacking, partly because of the complexity of the var gene family and the inability to model cytoadhesion with most culture-adapted laboratory isolates. in this study, we determined the var gene repertoires from the it <dig> and hb <dig> isolates and provide evidence for a recombination hierarchy that shapes the evolution of the pfemp <dig> virulence determinant. furthermore, determination of the nearly complete var gene repertoire from the cytoadhesive it <dig> parasite genotype, which has been adapted to both grow in the laboratory and infect new world monkeys, provides a unique capability to model cytoadhesion and immune acquisition in vitro and in vivo. future binding and expression studies with cytoadhesive laboratory isolates, such as it <dig> and hb <dig>  in conjunction with analyses of the fully sequenced genomes will allow us to classify pfemp <dig> proteins into biologically meaningful subsets and greatly accelerate understanding into malaria pathogenesis and immune evasion.
