BACKGROUND
amplified fragment length polymorphism  is a dna fingerprinting technique using electropherograms  <cit> . aflp analysis belongs to the category of selective restriction fragment amplification techniques, which are based on the ligation of adapters to genomic restriction fragments followed by pcr-based amplification with adapter-specific primers  <cit> . this technique has been widely used for genotyping since it requires no prior knowledge of genomic dna sequences and offers potentially better discriminatory power and speed than the existing techniques for fingerprinting such as random-amplified polymorphism dna markers   <cit> . however, it has only been used to a limited extent for expression analysis  <cit> . the main problems with the comparison of aflp patterns are  variation in peak height, and  false positive peaks which often overlap with real peaks, probably due to differences in pcr efficiency  <cit> . there is room for tuning selective pcr amplification  <cit> .

recently, we developed an aflp-based gene expression profiling method called hicep   <cit> . the experimental and analytical procedures are essentially the same as those of aflp, i.e., the technique is based on the selective pcr amplification of restriction fragments from a total restriction digest of genomic dna. refinements of the selective pcr technique improved reproducibility and reduced the rate of false positive peaks as well as the number of peaks. they also enabled the digestion of purified genomic dna with two four-nucleotide recognition restriction enzymes, having a higher cutting frequency, such as mspi and msei. consequently, the hicep method can detect a slight expression change of transcript-derived fragments  with high coverage. the estimated  <dig>  transcripts expressed in a cell are divided into  <dig> subgroups  containing approximately  <dig> pcr-amplified tdfs. this number is small enough to be separated by fluorescent capillary electrophoresis using an automated dna sequencer such as the abi prism  <dig> . we can achieve higher throughput by using several fluorescent dyes at once  <cit> .

normally, digitized electropherograms are imported into image analysis software such as genescan , which outputs each fragment  together with its length , area and height , carrying out accurate fragment sizing and background subtraction for most of the operations. genescan is capable of separating the signal from each fluorophore to provide higher throughput analysis. however, it should be noted that intense signals from abundant tdfs can breed into each other, potentially confusing the fragment sizing  <cit> . furthermore, the use of a frequently matching 4-bp cutting endonuclease  tends to produce many small tdfs  and in our experience this range is prone to errors of fragment sizing. cumulative errors of fragment sizing interfere with normalization across different electropherograms and lead to the mis-assignment of valid tdfs. hence, more detailed analysis such as observation of gradual expression changes in the time series of a tdf still counts in subjective visual examination  <cit> . further preprocessing of the electrophoretic data to be compared, each of which is independently normalized according to molecular weight standards, is needed.

the purpose of the present study is to develop a normalization method for the automated analysis of temporal electrophoretic data. we assume the samples to be compared are identical, that tdfs have similar fragment lengths across electropherograms and that expression changes can be detected as variations in peak height using the hicep technique. the performance of the method is demonstrated by analyzing a large set of time-course data obtained from mouse embryonic stem  cells, using hicep.

RESULTS
we analyzed a total of  <dig> hicep electropherograms , containing time-course data of embryonic stem  cells  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> h after adding stimulation for differentiation. reproducibility was confirmed by the duplication. we applied the current method to each of the  <dig> sets.

delineation of quality profiles for lanes
when a set of electrophoretic data is arranged and surveyed, one can often find ranges  in which peak fragment lengths are incorrectly measured. for example, in fig. 1a three lanes  in the range  appear to be compressed on the short side. this is probably because another intense peak just under  <dig> bp is mistaken for the  <dig> bp marker peak. this reduces the overall similarity between lanes and makes it difficult to recognize identical tdfs such as red filled peaks in fig. 1a.

to this end, we first developed a method for displaying dissimilar ranges. the method is based on a moving-fragment approach that continuously determines the average correlation coefficient between particular lane ptarget and the other lanes within a certain range using equation  <dig>  by using the average correlation coefficients, we can make a quality score function qk  for all lanes  at arbitrary length t . an example of the calculation for lane  <dig> h- <dig> is shown in table  <dig>  the 'quality profiles' delineated from q take the place of detailed visual evaluation of dissimilar ranges . undoubtedly, false peaks must have been used incorrectly at  <dig> bp in three lanes  and at  <dig> bp in two lanes .

detection of dissimilar ranges
next, we applied a simple method for the automated detection of dissimilar ranges to  <dig> sets of electrophoretic data . the method identified a total of  <dig> dissimilar ranges. most  of the ranges were of  <dig> bp or less. this is reasonable because the main source of fragment sizing errors is the presence of intense peaks near the marker  <cit>  and the hicep technique tends to produce short fragments. in fact, of a total of  <dig>  detected peaks in the range  analyzed by genescan,  <dig>   were <  <dig> bp.

visual examination revealed many of those ranges to be genuine, but not all. the set of ten electropherograms shown in fig.  <dig> is a good example. our method identified seven ranges as dissimilar: five lanes  in range  and two lanes  in range . of these, we at first suspected that two lanes  in range  were false-positives . however, we observed that the range in the two lanes is worthy of being normalized: the fragment lengths on the short side of the range deviate gradually from the mean lengths of lanes  <dig> h- <dig>   <dig> h- <dig>   <dig> h- <dig>  and  <dig> h- <dig> .

visual examination of all the electropherograms did not reveal any false-negative errors . recall that the samples to be compared are identical and that the measure of the quality of fragment sizing is based on a calculation of the average correlation between electropherograms. these results suggest that the normalization strategy we present here is useful, especially for temporal expression analysis.

the effectiveness of the method depends on the choice of the parameter t in equation  <dig> in the methods section, which is the number of consecutive fragments making up the quality profile examined by the program. quality profiles using the shortest span  are noisier than those using a moderate span, and runs using spans of less than four fragments were found unsatisfactory in our investigation. on the other hand, long spans  tended to miss small dissimilar ranges. these trends are essentially the same as those in the delineation of hydropathy plots of proteins using a moving-window approach and in the detection of transmembrane regions  <cit> . although we set t =  <dig> throughout the analysis, further improvement in the choice of parameters as well as the method for the detection of dissimilar ranges remains to be studied.

normalization of dissimilar ranges
to normalize dissimilar ranges across a set of electropherograms, it is necessary to select one as a reference. in conventional algorithms the reference is selected manually  <cit> . for reproducible automated normalization, it is vital that the choice be objective. our method selects the lane  having the highest average quality score in a given dissimilar range. in the case of fig.  <dig>  our method selects  <dig> h- <dig> as the best reference in ranges  and . we cannot, of course, reject the possibility that accurate fragment sizing is performed in the minority group  in fig. 1), but it is natural that the best reference should be selected from lanes in the majority group.

we prepared two models for accurate normalization of various types of fragment sizing errors. model  <dig> is the case of an incorrect fragment sizing at the shortest  marker peak. figure  <dig> shows an example of normalization using model  <dig>  the best approximating profile  is determined by considering various combinations of candidates from d × 100% expansion  to d × 100% compression of the short side of the original profile at intervals of d bp. the best approximating profile is one of the candidate profiles with {x × d - d × } /  × 100% compression of the side in a given range , where x = { <dig>   <dig>  ...,  <dig> ×  × d / d}. there is of course a trade-off between the computation time and the normalization accuracy in the choices of parameters. in model  <dig>  we set d =  <dig>  and d =  <dig> . we expected that the normalization would be achieved by a linear expansion of the short side of the dissimilar range  by anchoring the long-side in the target lane  <dig> h- <dig>  indeed, the best approximating profile that achieved the highest correlation coefficient against the reference  <dig> h- <dig> was the case of x =  <dig> .

a quality profile for lane  <dig> h- <dig> indicates that an incorrect normalization is performed in range  of the lane. the low correlation coefficient  between the normalized profile and the reference  <dig> h- <dig> in the range, compared to values  between four other normalized profiles  and the reference in the corresponding range, strengthens this suspicion . after visual examination it was decided that the dissimilar range  of lane  <dig> h- <dig> should be extended on the long side. we searched for the best range to be normalized and chose . the correlation coefficient of the normalized profile, expanded by  <dig> % on the short side in the range , was  <dig> . undoubtedly an exhaustive search for edges in dissimilar range might yield better normalization for some cases. however, it also dramatically increases the possible combinations of normalization candidates. it is a balance between the computation time and the number of analyzable tdfs.

one way to do objective evaluation of normalized electrophoretic patterns is to re-delineate the quality profiles . generally, a higher quality score qk  for lane k indicates greater consistency with the other lanes around arbitrary length t if the sample is identical . the quality scores after normalization overall were higher than before . this means the assignments of the quality scores to time-course electrophoretic data are effective for evaluating reproducibility.

evaluation of the method
the normalization method we propose here can be regarded as an image warping method which deforms images by mapping between image domains  <cit> . there are a number of reports on warping methods especially for dealing with two-dimensional  images  <cit> . there are also some methods for 1-d electrophoretic data  <cit> . comparison with these methods might provide an objective evaluation of the current method. however, they are not directly comparable with the current method because of different frameworks such as input data format, the requirement of pre-determined parameters, and so on  <cit> .

a critical step in the analysis of 1-d electrophoretic data is the assignment of the correct size to each tdf. in time-course data, one expects that the same tdfs should have quite close fragment lengths across electropherograms and that temporal expression changes are reflected as differences in peak height. we developed the current method aimed at temporal expression analysis by the electrophoretic method and used a scoring system for an objective evaluation of experimental reproducibility using qk  which indicates a relative similarity at t  in lane k to the other lanes. we demonstrate two other sets of electrophoretic data and discuss the feasibility of the method.

we should demonstrate the case of normalization to dissimilar range  where both models  <dig> and  <dig> are applicable. a set of ten electrophoretic patterns and their quality scores shown in figure  <dig> is the good example. there are three lanes with dissimilar range  detected by the method. of these,  <dig> h- <dig> and  <dig> h- <dig> were normalized using model  <dig> and  <dig> h- <dig> was normalized using model  <dig>  visual evaluation of the electrophoretic patterns and the quality scores after normalization verified the choices of the models as appropriate . the use of normalized electrophoretic patterns facilitates the identification of tdfs  having potential temporal expression change. the development of a peak alignment algorithm for multiple lanes and integration with the current method are the next challenge.

we also estimated the feasibility of the method with regard to an increasing number of peaks with certain quality score or more. the minimum value of q necessary for the accurate alignment of valid tdfs across lanes is about  <dig>  . accordingly, we set the threshold to be  <dig> . the number of peaks with q ≥  <dig>  in the range  before and after normalization are  <dig>   and  <dig>  , respectively. furthermore,  <dig>   of the  <dig>   new high-quality peaks were <  <dig> bp, which corresponds to the biased distribution of the detected dissimilar ranges .

CONCLUSIONS
when we apply the method to hicep time-course data, we assume that the set of electrophoretic data to be compared is identical . the monitoring of temporal expression change by the hicep technique has great potential for screening of genes related to chemotherapeutic drug resistance, circadian rhythm, and so on  <cit> . although the current method was developed for pre-processing hicep data, the algorithm is easily applicable to the processing of other 1-d electrophoretic data such as aflp and dd if the samples are identical or nearly identical. we strongly recommend the strategy be widely used for data processing for temporal expression analysis by the electrophoretic method.
