BACKGROUND
barley  is a model genome system for the triticeae, which includes wheat and rye, since it is a self-fertile diploid  that shares homoeologous chromosomes with other members of the triticeae  <cit> . however, genome sequencing of barley has been delayed due to its large genome size   <cit> . an alternative genomics resource - a large number of expressed sequence tags  - has been developed for barley. quality controlled est information is available from the harvest:barley database  <cit> .

genome wide mapping of these ests provides an important framework of genome structure that can be used to approach whole genome sequencing, as demonstrated in rice  <cit> . we have developed a high resolution est linkage map of barley using progeny of a single cross and  <dig>  pcr-based markers  <cit> . the ests were derived from non-redundant 3' sequences, generating a comprehensive distribution of genes on the barley linkage map. this high density est map provides a foundation for map-based genome analysis by providing a basis for selecting bac  clones for sequencing  <cit> . the mapped barley ests also provide access to other genomes, such as rice  via homology. for example, an integrated barley transcript map identified micro-colinearity between rice genome sequence and barley ests  <cit> . although the chromosome numbers of barley and rice are different, complete chromosomal colinearity has been reported between barley chromosome 3h and rice chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . this finding is of particular interest in terms of genome evolution in grasses. it also makes the homoeologous group  <dig> chromosomes of the triticeae a logical target for chromosome oriented genome sequencing, using rice as a reference genome  <cit> .

several bac libraries have been developed in barley. the first bac library was developed for the american malting barley cultivar "morex"  <cit> . morex traces to barley germplasm of manchurian origin and was used as a parent of mapping populations used for extensive linkage and qtl mapping  <cit> . another high quality bac library was developed using the japanese malting barley cultivar "haruna nijo"  <cit> . haruna nijo traces to barley germplasm of european origin and therefore may have a haplotype for brewing-related genes similar to european malting barleys. since these two representative barley cultivars have different origins, the bac libraries developed from them should contain the sequence variation that leads to phenotypic variation for quality and agronomic characters.

our goal is to contribute to this deeper understanding of allelic variation in barley by developing, characterizing, and providing the full complement of genomics tools  cdnas and bac library) developed for haruna nijo at okayama university. morex will be used as the target haplotype by the international barley sequencing consortium  <cit> . the simultaneous sequencing of two haplotypes will be much more useful than single haplotype analysis, as it will reveal the basis of structural and functional allelic diversity within the species.

recent advances in high-throughput sequencing are based on bead capture and parallel sequencing reads. however, read lengths are still short compared to traditional sanger sequencing. among the fast reading systems, liquid phase pyrosequencing  <cit>  provides the longest reads and is the most promising method for bac clones  <cit> . here we report the results of pooled sequencing of bac clones selected with ests genetically mapped to chromosome 3h.

RESULTS
bac clone sequencing efficiency
 <dig> est markers were used to select  <dig> bac clones from a haruna nijo pooled genomic library that were then chosen for sequencing. the insert size of  <dig> bac clones ranged from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb, with an average of  <dig> kb. the minimum redundancy of sequence reads was  <dig> x, making for a standard read of  <dig> mb per bac clone . after trimming bac vector  and e. coli k <dig> genome sequences, there were  <dig>  contigs greater than  <dig> bp, meaning that on average  <dig> contigs were obtained from each clone. contig lengths ranged from  <dig> bp to  <dig>  bp, with an average  <dig>  bp. the tentative number of barley unigenes is  <dig> , based on cap <dig> assembly  <cit>  of 3' end ests and flcdnas  <cit> . the number of contigs with significant blastn  <cit>  homology  with these tentative unigenes was  <dig> . in some cases, only short sequence segments in the contigs show homology to the unigenes; thus the number of gene-bearing contigs may actually be lower. the average number of unigenes per contig was  <dig> . there was no correlation between contig length and number of unigenes per contig . of the  <dig> est sequences used for the bac clone selection,  <dig> ests allowed the selection of  <dig> bac clones, as seven ests were used to select first and second bac clones due to an insufficient insert size of first bac clone in the initial pooled library. of the  <dig> ests,  <dig> were identified on the contigs . the contigs that show homology ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp with an average of  <dig>  bp .

there are probably  <dig> - <dig>  genes in barley, based on the total number of expressed rice genes  database  <cit> ) and the  <dig>  barley unigene estimate cited above. the number of genes on chromosome 3h, as calculated by simple division, would be  <dig> - <dig> . this estimate is lent credence by the reported number of genes on wheat chromosome 3b  <cit> . chromosome 3h may be ~  <dig> mbp in length, based on simple division of total genome size  by the chromosome number . based on these rough calculations one would expect ~  <dig> genes/mb. the total contig sequence length of the present analysis is ~  <dig> mb. as indicated later, number of rice orfs identified on the total contigs was  <dig>  . this indicates  <dig> gene candidates are estimated per mb. even factoring in overestimation of gene number due to incorrect homology, the number of gene candidates identified was far more than the predicted number. this may indicate a highly efficient rate of gene discovery.

on the other hand, the total read length of  <dig> mbp represents ~ 4% of chromosome 3h and is much less than the total length of the bac sequences . the shorter total read length may indicate sequence overlaps between the bac clones which were selected by genetically mapped ests . a massive translocation line study  <cit>  estimated that  <dig> % of the genetic markers mapped to recombination hot spots representing only  <dig> % of the barley genome. thus, bac selection by genetically mapped markers may lead to an inevitably high level of sequence duplication. we also expected sequence duplication in the current analysis since mapped ests appear in several dense clusters on the same genetic positions in figure  <dig> and seven of these ests were used to select multiple bac clones. some efficiencies might be achieved by using physically mapped markers  <cit> .

homology with rice genes and the rice genome
the rap <dig> rice pseudomolecule  <cit>  was used as a basis for homology search with the  <dig> contigs identified by ests mapped to barley chromosome 3h . of these contigs,  <dig> showed significant blast scores  with sequences on rice chromosome  <dig>  a comparison of genetic map positions with the rice genome is shown in figure  <dig>  there is clear colinearity between the two species, except for the centromeric region. there is some evidence for an inversion on the long arm; additional detailed sequence analysis will be required. this high level of colinearity indicates that sequences from rice chromosome  <dig> can be used very efficiently for identification of sequences on barley chromosome 3h.

all  <dig>  rap <dig> rice gene nucleotide sequences  <cit>  were used to determine homology with all barley sequence contigs greater than  <dig> bp. six percent  of the genes in rice showed homology  with these contigs . barley regions showing homology with rice genes  were also analyzed. the existence of full rice gene sequences on barley contig is confirmed by the start and end positions of rice gene on the respective contig sequence. this evaluation revealed  <dig>  rice homologous genes on barley contigs . of these rice genes,  <dig> are assigned to rice chromosome  <dig>  indicating that our preliminary sequencing of barley chromosome 3h bac clones have homology with 12% of the genes on rice chromosome  <dig> 

one of the aims of this bac clone sequencing project was the rapid identification of genes in contig sequences. since the number of barley flcdnas available for this purpose  is limited compared to the total number of barley genes, the efficiency of barley gene identification was estimated based on homologous rice genes. the large number of rice gene homologous sequences   identified in barley contigs is a parallel line of evidence for our high rate of barley gene discovery. conversely, the high number of barley genes assigned to chromosome  <dig> of rice  indicates that the focused sequencing of the barley genome using rice genome resources is an effective strategy. specifically, an efficient barley genome sequencing strategy can be based on sequencing est-positive bac pools using a filtration system followed by the confirmation with homologous rice genes.

as a more closely related reference genome to barley, a set of coding sequences of brachypodium distachyon  <cit>  were searched for homology with the contig sequences . the number of sequences showing homology to the barley contigs was  <dig>   and higher than that of rice . when a detailed annotation of the brachypodium genome is available, it will be a valuable resource for barley genetics since brachypodium is more closely related to barley than rice.

 <dig> sequencing capacity
the sequencing capacity of  <dig> is far greater than a high-throughput sanger system. however, the combination of shorter read length and bac clone pooling used in this study could cause problems for sequence assembly. if the read length is  <dig> bp by gs <dig>  an assembly error may occur when sequence repeats more than  <dig> bp are present. to avoid miss-assembly, all pool libraries contained flx reads . survey sequencing  <cit>  demonstrated the robustness of sequence assembly using the  <dig> gs <dig>  by comparing sequences with those obtained with a sanger sequencing system. pooled bac sequencing technology by  <dig> was also used to assess the feasibility of sequencing bac pools of atlantic salmon  <cit> ), melon  <cit> ) and rice  <cit> . there may be a certain level of assembly error in the sequences we report from this study that could be corrected in the future by repeating reads in the different haplotypes, or by generating scaffolds with a paired-end sequencing system  <cit> .

another issue with our sequencing strategy is identifying each bac clone in the pooled shotgun library. a technique to identify each clone by short tag sequences is becoming available   <cit> . however, shotgun library development for each clone is costly and limits sequencing capacity. the pooled bac sequencing strategy used in this study is a pioneering step for barley and the triticeae and it may be the most efficient strategy by the current technical standards.

development and function of a genome browsing system
the  <dig>  contigs with sequences longer than  <dig> bp were aligned with reference sequences installed on the gbrowse system  <cit>  . the browser also has search functions using sequence queries and mapped ests  on a cmap browser  <cit> . the blastn analysis using flcdnas gave  <dig>  contigs greater than  <dig> bp with significant blastn scores . of these,  <dig> contigs showed homology to multiple flcdna clone sequences, providing evidence for possible alternative splicing of some genes . an example of gbrowse alignment by mapping homologous regions from multiple flcdnas on a contig is shown in figure  <dig> 

browser functions will be expanded as more genome sequences are deposited. the flexible connections that are provided to connect genechip expression data, genetic map data, and cdna data will promote rapid isolation of barley genes and analysis of their functions. as demonstrated by the cmap query function in the current browser , the combination of genetic map and partial genome sequence is a framework for genome sequencing of gene rich regions in barley.

haplotype information for breeding materials and genetic stocks is important for plant breeders  <cit> . even if only sparse genome information is available, comparisons of sequences in diverse germplasm may provide important information for crop improvement. thus, one of the ultimate functions of a barley genome browser may be to reveal critical sequence polymorphisms in germplasm. the release of partial genome sequences of morex bac clones  will, in the near future, demonstrate this genome browser utility.

CONCLUSIONS
our results for haruna nijo chromosome 3h are the first comprehensive genome sequence information for barley. since there are additional markers on chromosome 3h mapped in other germplasm  <cit>  , more 3h bac clones could be sequenced. the haplotype sequence of haruna nijo will likely be quite different from that of morex, which will be used by the international barley genome sequencing consortium  <cit> . therefore, the availability of multiple haplotypes will result in complementary information on genome structure that will provide a basis for efficient polymorphism detection.

in spite of recent innovations in genome sequencing, a bac-by-bac sequencing strategy for barley is not efficient. a possible approach will be to combine sequencing of est bearing-bacs and shotgun whole genome, or chromosome specific, libraries  <cit> . the sequencing and annotation system used in this study will also be applicable, except for the assembly of highly redundant reads on a whole genome basis.
