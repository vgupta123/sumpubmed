BACKGROUND
bovine respiratory disease complex  is the most common infectious disease and the leading natural cause of death among cattle in the united states  <cit> , with the onset of disease generally considered to be initiated by a stressful event that suppresses the normal host immune response, thereby enabling opportunistic viral and bacterial infections of the respiratory tract. many diverse pathogens can be involved in this process, such that bovine respiratory disease is considered to be etiologically complex , and perhaps more challenging to control or mitigate than many diseases caused by a single, discrete pathogen. the most common viral pathogens associated with brdc include: bovine herpesvirus  <dig>  bovine parainfluenza virus  <dig>  bovine viral diarrhea viruses  <dig> and  <dig>  bovine respiratory syncytial virus, bovine adenoviruses a-d, and bovine coronavirus, whereas the most common bacterial pathogens are arcanobacterium pyogenes, manheimia haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, histophilus somni, and mycoplasma spp. <cit> .

bovine respiratory disease complex is commonly observed in beef and dairy calves, with both acute and long term effects on health and performance . acute effects include production or performance losses associated with the symptoms of brdc that include fever, rapid breathing, repetitive coughing, nasal and/or eye discharge, diarrhea, dehydration and appetite depression  <cit> . the prevalence of brdc is temporally variable, with the proportion of affected feedlot cattle ranging from 5% to 44% over a 15 year period, with an average overall prevalence of 17% in u.s. feedlots  <cit> . in pre-weaned u.s. dairy calves, the prevalence of brdc over a 20 year period ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> %  <cit> . the mortality rate for brdc in pre-weaned dairy calves was  <dig> %, even though  <dig> % of all heifers diagnosed with brdc were treated with an antimicrobial agent, and the majority of these calves were also vaccinated for one or more known pathogens  <cit> . chronic effects of brdc have resulted in reduced growth rates and decreased productivity of cows later in life  <cit> . cows affected by respiratory disease as a calf were twice as likely to die before calving, and calved at an older age as heifers, than those cows that were not affected by brdc prior to 90 days of age  <cit> .

despite the availability and use of vaccines for common respiratory pathogens, the prevalence of brdc in dairy and beef animals is not declining  <cit> . additional approaches to reduce the prevalence or prevent brdc are needed to positively augment the use of vaccines and current best management practices aimed at reducing stress. selection of breeding stock that are less susceptible to brdc represents one viable approach that could be implemented, with the expectation of systematically reducing brdc prevalence over the long term. previous studies have identified genetic differences among animals in relation to brdc susceptibility, thereby providing ample support and precedent for this hypothesis and investigation . the objective of this study was to identify loci associated with brdc susceptibility in pre-weaned holstein calves via a case–control study design. genome-wide association analyses  identified genomic regions associated with brdc that were largely concordant across four analytical approaches. this level of concordance has not often been reported in other holstein gwaa studies that have evaluated multiple methods  <cit> , which strongly underscores the potential for genomic selection enabled by brdc susceptibility loci reported here. additionally, heritability was estimated for brdc susceptibility in both the individual and the combined ca and nm holstein populations to further evaluate the potential for reducing the prevalence of brdc through the selection of less susceptible breeding stock.

RESULTS
study animals
prior to gwaa, seven of the pre-weaned california  calves  were removed due to conflicts with their reported disease status and health scores . likewise,  <dig>  of the control calves  were later reclassified as brdc cases prior to weaning , and were subsequently removed from the analysis of the distribution of health scores . however, these animals did remain in the gwaa. consequently,  <dig>  calves  from ca were used in this study. a total of  <dig> calves identified as females were enrolled from new mexico . eighteen of the animals were subsequently identified to be a jersey or a jersey crossbred and were removed; leaving  <dig> holstein identified heifers in the nm study;  <dig> as controls and  <dig> cases. six percent of the heifers  originally classified as matched controls later converted to brdc case-status but remained in the study, as new diagnostic health scores and swabs were obtained at the time of conversion. further details regarding the study animals  may be found in additional file 1: table s <dig> 

diagnostics
the observed pathogen profiles of the ca and nm animals differed for all pathogens with the exception of bovine herpes virus and bovine viral diarrhea virus, which were rarely detected  . the detection of different pathogens in ca and nm may have been influenced by the stage of disease at the time that the diagnostic swabs were obtained at each study site. the difference in the mean health scores between cases and controls  representing the two populations  may simply reflect local differences in brdc disease progression, possibly due to environmental differences or differences in brdc pathogen at the two study sites . notably, viruses that were important during the initiation of brdc in holstein calves may have been missed since the clinical manifestation of disease is necessary to identify cases using the mcguirk scoring system  <cit> . moreover, some viruses are only rarely detected in the bovine pharynx beyond the first two days of infection , which may have impacted our diagnostic results. because this study occurred in an industry setting, the timing and certainty of pathogen exposure was unknown. however, the bacteriology and virology obtained from mid-nasal and deep pharyngeal swabs in this study collectively represent the largest ever dairy cattle diagnostic survey of respiratory pathogens which are likely to influence the clinical manifestation of brdc. this survey is useful for a variety of reasons, including understanding why gwaa signals might potentially differ between locales, and for understanding the overall diversity in detectable pathogen profiles, as well as their putative frequency distributions among holstein calves classified as brdc cases and controls  <cit> . therefore, the diagnostic data were helpful in providing a general overview of brdc pathogen diversity at the time of phenotype classification , but do not necessarily provide precise insight into the temporal and sequential progression of disease with associated pathogens across time. nevertheless, the use of deep pharyngeal swabs has the very clear advantages of being a much more rapid, less costly, and less invasive sampling technique than transtracheal washes or bronchioalveolar lavage.table  <dig>

genome wide association analysis
heritability estimates. implementation of emmax  <cit>  in conjunction with a genomic relationship matrix   <cit>  and an additive model produced moderate pseudo-heritability estimates  for brdc susceptibility in ca holstein calves. the pseudo-heritability, as previously defined  <cit> , is the proportion of phenotypic variance that is explained by the empirically estimated relationship matrix. although it is not an exact analytical replicate of the heritability estimate produced by restricted maximum likelihood estimation  in the genomic best linear unbiased prediction  analyses, the emmax-grm pseudo-heritability estimate was very similar to the gblup reml heritability estimate  for brdc susceptibility in the california calves. emmax-grm analyses performed using an additive genetic model also produced a moderate pseudo-heritability estimate  for brdc susceptibility in the nm calves, which was nearly identical to the gblup reml estimate . in a final analysis, we combined the nm and ca calves into a single case–control cohort. emmax-grm pseudo-heritability for brdc susceptibility within the combined cohort was again moderate , but considerably lower than the estimates produced for the individual populations. this result was supported by the gblup reml estimated heritability for the combined population , which was very similar to emmax-grm .table  <dig>

the heritability estimates of approximately  <dig>  for brdc susceptibility are greater than similar estimates for other health traits such as mastitis , cystic ovaries , ketosis , metritis  and lameness , but lower than estimates for displaced abomasum  and retained placenta  previously reported in dairy cows . bovine clinical mastitis  is similar to brdc in that a variety of microorganisms can be involved in the disease etiology. in cm, heritability estimates increase when the animal health phenotype is more precisely defined by the specific microorganism involved in the cm etiology  <cit> . for example, heritability estimates for susceptibility to cm caused by coliform species were found to be moderate   <cit> , and similar to our estimates for brdc, whereas heritability estimates were lower when cm cases were pooled , or when cm cases were undetected , thereby underscoring the importance of precise animal disease phenotypes.

moderate heritability estimates for brdc susceptibility strongly suggest that there is ample opportunity to use genomic selection to reduce the prevalence of brdc in holstein dairy cattle. the reduction in heritability estimated for the combined ca and nm cohort, in comparison to the individual population estimates, is a complex phenomenon that likely reflects environmental differences as well as differences in the host genetic basis for differential susceptibility to a variety of brdc pathogens that were detected at variable frequencies within the two populations. however, it should also be noted that the nm calves also tended to be older and presumably more clinically ill   <cit>  at sampling than did the ca calves, with the majority of the calves enrolled in the ca study being males, and nearly all of the calves enrolled in the nm study identified as being females by illumina hd genotype . studies are currently underway to evaluate the statistical relationship between pathogen profiles, and the clinical scores   <cit>  assigned to all holstein calves.

california population
when the top  <dig>  snps  for ca were compared across the four analytical approaches for the case–control phenotype, a strong concordance of association with brdc susceptibility was observed. among the top  <dig>  snps from each analytical approach, each snp  was given a ranking  and these rankings were summed across all analytical approaches for each population . for the ca calves, figure  <dig> shows the manhattan plots for all analyses . in ca, the most significant locus across all four analyses was located on bta <dig> between 30–31 mb . this was also the most significant locus detected using emmax-grm , gblup  and fvr . the same bta <dig> locus was also ranked 30th among snps most strongly associated  with brdc susceptibility using eigenstrat . this snp association was supported by  <dig> adjacent snps ranked among the top  <dig> snps, and  <dig> snps ranked among the top  <dig>  snps for either their magnitude of association or the proportion of variance explained with respect to brdc susceptibility. the poliovirus receptor-related  <dig>  gene is proximal and adjacent to this gwaa signal.table  <dig>

pvrl <dig> is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is known to mediate entry of several herpes viruses, including bovine herpes virus  <dig> , the causative agent of infectious bovine rhinotracheitis , which is also a known etiological agent of brdc  <cit> . notably, bhv- <dig> was not diagnostically detected in the mid-nasal or pharyngeal swabs from the ca holstein calves, but previous experimental challenge and pathology studies have demonstrated that many respiratory viruses, including bhv- <dig>  are only transiently present in the pharynx prior to settling into the lung . therefore, it is unsurprising that bhv- <dig> was not detected by our diagnostic procedures, although the host genomic signature of this pathogen was clearly detected and well supported statistically by all gwaa approaches. our failure to detect bhv- <dig> likely reflects the temporal and/or transient differences in viral expression and pathology , including latency of the virus in the trigeminal ganglion, or perhaps other factors, both known and unknown  <cit> . bhv- <dig> causes a lifelong latent infection and sporadic shedding of the virus which can lead to horizontal transmission to other animals in the herd. in addition to brdc, ibr also has the potential to cause rhinotracheitis, vaginitis, balanoposhitis, abortion, conjunctivitis, and enteritis  <cit> . ulcers of bhv- <dig> infected animals often occur in the mouth and nose, with mortality as high as 10%  <cit> .

a second locus of interest identified across all analyses was located on bta <dig> between 63–64 mb. it contained the 6th ranked snp by eigenstrat , the 7th ranked snp by gblup , the 14th ranked snp by emmax-grm , and the 15th ranked fvr snp . this locus was supported by  <dig> top ranked snps, and was located near positional candidate genes baalc, atp6v1c <dig> and azin <dig> 

the most highly ranked snp in this region across all analyses was proximal to azin <dig> , a gene that is involved in many biological processes, and that is most highly expressed in both lung and skeletal muscle  <cit> . azin <dig> has been associated with fanconi’s anemia, tumorogenesis, cirrhosis of the liver, and regulation of polyamine synthesis . the azin <dig> protein  regulates ornithine decarboxylase stability, which degrades polyamines, and in turn, up-regulates azin <dig>  interestingly, ornithine carboxylase activity and elevated polyamine levels are detected when cells are transformed by viral agents  <cit> . individuals with deleterious mutations involving azin <dig>  may be more likely to become infected with viruses, such as hepatitis c  <cit> . some mutations in azin <dig> may also enhance susceptibility to other viruses, such as those implicated in the clinical manifestation of brdc. flanking genes within this region include brain and acute leukemia cytoplasmic , and atpase, h+ transporting, lysosomal 42 kda, v <dig> subunit c <dig> . mutations in baalc are implicated in myeloid leukemogenesis, and are associated with a poor prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia as well as acute lymphoblastic leukemia  <cit> . the atpases are proton pumps that are involved in a wide variety of physiological processes  <cit> . in drosophila, the overexpression of v <dig> subunits was recently found to alter the replication capacity of influenza virus  <cit> . it is also conceivable that alteration of v <dig> subunits could potentially play a role in the replication capacity of other viruses, such as those involved in brdc  <cit> .

the third most significant locus across all analyses for ca was a 91 kb region defined by  <dig> snps on bta <dig> between  <dig> and 120 mb. the snp rankings for eigenstrat, fvr and gblup were very similar , while emmax-grm ranked this locus 65th . no annotated genes are known to reside in this region of the genome.

the fourth most significant locus for ca across all analyses was a 10 kb region on bta <dig> between  <dig> and 4 mb . this was the 2nd most highly ranked locus for gblup , 5th for emmax-grm , and the 76th and 115th ranked marker for fvr  and eigenstrat , respectively. the bta <dig> snps identified as being associated with brdc susceptibility are within an intron and exon of the dystonin gene . interestingly, the previously described positional candidate gene pvrl <dig> and dst share similar functions, as they both play a role in herpes virus infections  <cit> , one of the common brdc pathogens responsible for ibr.

the dystonin protein is essential for anchoring epidermal cells to the underlying basement membrane, and dystonin proteins also function as autoantigens in a group of skin diseases that affect humans  <cit> . dystonin is also an integral component of hemidesmosomes, and is regulated by interferon gamma  <cit> . relevant to our brdc gwaa, dystonin is important in the transport of herpes simplex virus  <dig> capsids to the nucleus of the host cell through the microtubule network  <cit> . moreover, if the dystonin protein is depleted, capsid transport and efficient herpes virus infections are strongly inhibited  <cit> .

the locus ranked fifth across all gwaa approaches in the ca population was on bta <dig> between 14–15 mb . this locus was ranked 3rd  by eigenstrat , 19th by the fvr approach , 67th by gblup , and 156th by emmax-grm . the associated snp lies within intron two of mastermind-like  <dig>  which has been associated with mucoepidermoid carcinoma, and height in humans .

new mexico population
manhattan plots for the nm calves for all analyses are shown in figure  <dig>  the most highly ranked locus across all gwaa approaches for nm was located on bta <dig> between  <dig> and 71 mb . this locus was defined by  <dig> snps and contained the second most highly ranked snp for fvr , the second highest ranked snp for emmax-grm , the third highest ranked snp for gblup  and the 31st ranked snp for eigenstrat . investigation of the associated region  revealed two uncharacterized loci   <cit> , and no annotated genes.

across all gwaa analyses, the second most highly ranked locus for nm was located on bta <dig> between  <dig> and 8 mb and was characterized by  <dig> snps . the 25 kb region was located  <dig> and 9 kb away from the transfer rna glycine   and transfer rna cysteine   genes, respectively. this region contained the 5th ranked snp for emmax-grm , the 7th ranked snp for eigenstrat , the 30th ranked snp for fvr , and the 48th ranked snp for gblup .

the third ranked qtl for nm was on bta <dig>  . this region contained the 39th ranked snp for gblup , the 58th ranked snp for emmax-grm , the 62nd ranked snp for fvr  and the 90th ranked snp for eigenstrat . this qtl spanning  <dig>  kb involved  <dig> snps located in introns 1– <dig> of the zinc finger protein  <dig>  gene. at present, little is known about the function of this gene and protein, which precludes specific biological inferences in relation to brdc.

the 4th ranked locus for nm was located on bta <dig>  . this locus was only represented by a single snp, and was most highly ranked by eigenstrat . this locus was ranked 30th by gblup , 62nd by emmax-grm , and 175th by fvr . heparan sulfate 6-o-sulfotransferase  <dig>  is the only annotated gene in this region. one previous study suggests that hs6st <dig> may perform diverse functions  <cit> , and more recent studies have associated hs6st <dig> with obesity in humans  <cit> .

the 5th ranked locus for nm was located on bta <dig>  between  <dig> and 24 mb . this locus, spanning  <dig>  kb, had the highest ranking snp for emmax-grm , ranked 4th with the fvr approach , ranked 104th with gblup , and ranked 192nd with eigenstrat . no genes or obvious biological candidates were found in this genomic region, although an expressed sequence tagged site   <cit>  detected in bovine kidney tissue was found to underlie this peak.

combined california and new mexico population
when the top  <dig>  snps  for the combined population  were compared across the four analytical approaches for the case–control phenotype, we noted that the results were skewed toward those initially reported for the ca population . this was relatively unsurprising, as the ca holstein population had nearly three times the number of study animals as did the nm population, with the top ranked locus for brdc susceptibility in the combined population being the same top ranked locus identified for the ca holsteins . underlying this qtl signal was the highest ranked snp using emmax-grm  and gblup , the second highest ranked snp for fvr , and eleventh ranked snp for eigenstrat .figure  <dig> 
manhattan plots representing four genome wide association analyses for the binary brdc case–control phenotype using  emmax-grm,  gblup,  eigenstrat and  full versus reduced model regression  in the ca and nm calves combined. in panel a, the plot for emmax-grm case–control with covariates of sex, age, and herd of origin is shown. for emmax-grm, the first panel shows the –log10
p-values on the y axis and the second panel shows the proportion of variance explained by effects at a single snp. in panel b, the plot for gblup case–control with covariates of sex and age is shown. the y axis shows the proportion of variance explained by a sliding window of  <dig> snps centered on the third snp within each window. in panel c, the plot for eigenstrat case–control principle component corrected input data  with covariates of sex and age is shown. the –log10
p-values are indicated on the y axis. the blue line indicates the wellcome trust threshold for snps with modest evidence for association with brdc susceptibility, and the red line indicates the threshold for snps with strong evidence for association with brdc susceptibility. in panel d, the manhattan plot for fvr case–control principal component corrected input data  with covariates of sex, age, and herd of origin is shown. the first fvr panel shows the –log10
p-values on the y axis, and the second panel shows corresponding f-test values for the full versus reduced model analysis.



across all analyses, the second strongest association  in the combined cohort was observed on bta <dig>  . this snp was the highest ranked by eigenstrat , but was also highly ranked by the fvr approach , and by emmax-grm . this snp was ranked 188th by gblup . the bta <dig> snp associated with brdc susceptibility is located within intron  <dig> of the myeloperoxidase  gene. the protein encoded by mpo is central to the activity of neutrophils, and sputum myeloperoxidase is recognized as a putative biomarker for neutrophil activity in pulmonary disease  <cit> .

for the combined cohorts , the third highest ranked locus across all analyses was represented by a single snp located on bta <dig>  . this snp was the second highest ranked snp by gplup , the 25th ranked snp by eigenstrat , the 33rd ranked snp by emmax-grm , and the 299th ranked snp by fvr . at present, no annotated genes have been described within 50 kb of this snp, thereby precluding the identification of one or more suitable positional candidate genes.

the fourth ranked genomic region for the combined cohort  was located on bta <dig> , and was ranked 64th among the results obtained using eigenstrat , 71st using fvr , 103rd using gblup , and 123rd using emmax-grm . the most proximal gene to this snp is retinol dehydrogenease  <dig>  , which is located approximately 13 kb away. this gene encodes a mitochondrial protein that recognizes retinoids as substrates and may protect the mitochondria from oxidative stress associated with exposure to retinaldehyde  <cit> .

the fifth ranked locus identified by all methodological approaches revealed a strong positional candidate gene on bta <dig>  that is supported by  <dig> snps and spans 19 kb . this qtl was identified by snps among the top  <dig> ranked for fvr , gblup  and emmax-grm . this snp was ranked 315th by eigenstrat . the most strongly associated snps were located within introns  <dig> and  <dig> of the slit homolog  <dig> ) gene  <cit> . slit <dig> is a very large gene spanning 727 kb. the protein encoded by slit <dig> has numerous functions, one of which includes the down regulation of inflammatory mediators such as il-1β, il- <dig> and il- <dig>  <cit> . slit <dig> has also been implicated in cell migration, axon guidance, inflammation, angiogenesis and organogenesis  <cit> . the slit family of proteins features a tandem of four leucine-rich repeat domains which mediate binding to the immunoglobulin-like domains of the roundabout  family of genes  <cit> . slit-robo signaling has been implicated in immune response through the regulation of dendritic cell migration  <cit> . airway dendritic cells are key regulators of pulmonary immune responses, and in the human lung, dendritic cells continuously present antigenic information from the airways to the pulmonary lymph nodes, thereby modulating the regulation of immune responses  <cit> . therefore, perturbations of bovine slit <dig> function may also influence susceptibility to brdc, making it a plausible functional candidate gene for future investigations.

CONCLUSIONS
differences existed in the ca and nm holstein calf populations in the ages of the calves when sampled, the average mcguirk health score  <cit>  of the cases and controls, and the gender of the calves. these differences were incorporated into the analysis models to account for age and gender of the calves. the differences between the ca and nm pathogens detected at sampling likely had an impact on the brdc susceptibility loci detected in the calves.

the brdc heritability estimate of  <dig>  for ca and nm calves was consistent across the two populations, but dropped to  <dig>  when the populations were combined. this decline is most likely due to pathogen and environmental differences at the two study sites. however, the moderate heritability  estimated for brdc susceptibility in the combined holstein population is sufficient to support a nation-wide approach to reduce the prevalence of brdc via genomic selection. although each of the methods used to conduct the gwaa have strengths and weaknesses, the concordance between the loci associated with brdc susceptibility across the four approaches has resulted in the identification of loci that are strong candidates for harboring causal mutations, and these qtl signals are less likely to have arisen solely by type  <dig> error. several biologically meaningful positional candidate loci were identified in this study. among these positional candidates are genes on bta <dig>  and bta <dig>  that are known to mediate herpes virus entry into host cells, a gene involved in viral susceptibility on bta <dig> , and a gene that modulates inflammation on bta <dig> . studies in bos taurus feedlot cattle are currently underway to determine if some of the same loci are associated with enhanced susceptibility to brdc in older cattle from different breeds.

selection and breeding of less susceptible cattle with respect to brdc is the most sustainable approach to reducing the prevalence of disease, as it will decrease the use of therapeutic antibiotics, lead to superior production efficiency, require less handling, and ultimately be more profitable. studies are currently underway to identify the causal mutations associated with enhanced brdc susceptibility, as an alternative to relying on array-based snp markers as imperfect predictors of these mutations. moreover, unlike approaches that rely on markers in linkage disequilibrium  with the causal mutations for genomic selection, the accuracy of utilizing causal mutations to predict susceptibility will not decay over time, and likely will have utility across breeds, which enhances the value and longevity of the final marker panel to the industry. identification of the causal mutations underlying brdc qtl will ensure that the initial work of this study is sustainably translated to industry, with qtls associated with enhanced brdc susceptibility providing the foundation for identifying causal mutations with the largest effects on susceptibility, so that these may be incorporated into predicted transmitting abilities  for commercial dairy artificial insemination  sires. as greater than 70% of the dairy calves in the u.s. are conceived by ai annually  <cit>  this will provide immediate translation of our discoveries to a large segment of the u.s. dairy industry.
