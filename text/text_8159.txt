BACKGROUND
the thousands of proteins expressed in cells perform many of their functions through interactions with other proteins. understanding protein-protein interactions is a crucial step in the investigation of many processes, such as intracellular signaling pathways  <cit> , antibody-antigen pairing  <cit> , enzyme-inhibitor interactions  <cit> . therefore, the detailed characterization on a structural basis of protein-protein complexes has become an important task for both wet and computational biologists. thousands of experimental structures of protein-protein complexes are currently available from the wwpdb  <cit>  and many more can be reliably predicted by computational approaches, as shown in the critical assessment of predicted interactions  experiment  <cit> .

the dynamical characterization of such complexes can add valuable information on the recognition process, and molecular dynamics  has indeed been long established as a useful tool to help understanding biological process at the atomic and molecular levels  <cit> . the recent advances in the computational power and the development of new theoretical methods have moreover made md simulations of large systems on a large time scale much more affordable than before  <cit> . however, md simulations of protein complexes suffer from the lack of specific tools in the analysis step. the analysis of md trajectories of protein complexes indeed generally relies on classical measures, such as root-mean-square deviation , root-mean-square-fluctuation  and radius of gyration, to list a few, conceived and developed for single macromolecules. as a matter of fact, instead, researchers engaged in simulating the dynamics of a protein complex are mainly interested in characterizing the conservation/variation of its biological interface.

whereas a large number of specific tools have been developed to analyze single biomolecules, for example to measure the volume of pockets in proteins , to analyze their hydrogen bonds network  or to characterize the fine structural details of dna molecules  during md simulations, there is a paucity of methods to specifically analyse md trajectories of protein complexes. in this context, we have previously shown that intermolecular contact maps , can be successful applied to the analysis of both experimental and predicted structures of protein-protein complexes  <cit> . in particular, we have shown that an intermolecular contact map can identify uniquely and intuitively the surface of interaction, representing a sort of fingerprint of the complex and reporting the crucial information in a ready-to-read form. it therefore allows to easily and intuitively discriminate between similar and different binding solutions  <cit> . furthermore, we have shown that intermolecular contact maps, together with the measure of the conservation of inter-molecular contacts, can be used to analyse docking model ensembles  <cit>  and to reliably extract from them the native-like solutions  <cit> .

herein we extend this approach to the analysis of md trajectories of protein complexes. we use the conservation of inter-residue contacts  at the interface as a measure of the similarity between different snapshots. a "consensus contact map" is also provided, where the conservation of the different contacts is drawn in a grey scale, and the complex interface area along the simulation is monitored. this novel approach is embodied in an algorithm we have named mdcons . in the following, as exemplary cases, we apply mdcons to study two protein-protein complexes with comparable interface areas and binding affinities at the extremes of the experimental range. we show that differences in the dynamic behavior of the analyzed systems, particularly at their biological interface, are efficiently outlined by the mdcons approach. as a final remark, we note that the importance of inter-residue contacts when analyzing 3d structures of protein complexes is well established. in the capri experiment, for instance, the correctness of a prediction, i.e. its similarity to the native structure, is assessed based on a combination of rmsd criteria and of conservation of inter-residue contacts, as compared to the native structure  <cit> . furthermore, the fraction of common inter-residue contacts among a set of docking models has been recently shown to successfully apply to their clustering  <cit> .

RESULTS
we developed a novel tool, mdcons, specifically devoted to the analysis of md trajectories for protein complexes, which is based on the conservation of ics during a md simulation and on its visualization in the form of an intermolecular contact map, that we made available at https://www.molnac.unisa.it/biotools/mdcons/index.php/mdcons. we have applied this novel approach to two protein-protein complexes sharing interfaces of similar size, about  <dig> Å <dig>  and both dominated by hydrophilic interactions, while dramatically differing in their experimentally measured binding affinities . the high binding affinity system corresponds to the cole7- im <dig> complex , while the low binding affinity one corresponds to the cd2-cd <dig> complex . their binding affinities are - <dig>  and - <dig>  kcal/mol, respectively, being at the extremes of the experimental range explored to date, that is approximately - <dig> to - <dig> kcal/mol  <cit> .

pdb ids, binding free energies in kcal/mol and mdcons results for the im7- cole <dig> and cd2-cd <dig> complexes

a scheme of the method workflow is reported in figure  <dig>   <dig> ns-long md simulations were performed on both complexes as detailed in the methods section and classical analyses were performed on the obtained trajectories. then,  <dig> snapshots for each structure were extracted every  <dig> ps and analysed by mdcons. mdcons provides as output: i) a "consensus map", i.e. a 2d map were ics are shown in a scale of grays were the more conserved the contact, the darker the spot, ii) a list of the ics with the corresponding conservation rates, crkl, iii) the fraction of ics which are conserved in at least 50%, 70% and 90% of the analysed snapshots , representing a measure of the overall conservation of the contacts during the simulations, and iv) the interface area of the complex along the simulation.

colicin e <dig> nuclease - im <dig> immunity protein complex 
structural overview. the structure includes the c-terminal dnase domain of e.coli colicin e <dig> , from residue  <dig> to  <dig>  and the full length  im <dig> immunity protein. colicins have cytotoxic activity against their target cells, which can be inhibited by their cognate immune proteins. the binding of colicins to their cognate immunity proteins are among the strongest recorded for protein-protein interactions and is also highly specific, being the cytotoxicity of each colicin only completely inhibited by its cognate immunity protein. interestingly, colicins with altered specificity may potentially be used as antibacterial agents  <cit> , and the cole7-im <dig> complex has indeed been object of extensive design studies  <cit> . the interacting surface of the cole7-im <dig> complex is highly charged, and also charge-complementary, while the surface complementarity is not so obvious  <cit> . im <dig> has a v-shaped structure, extending two arms to clamp the cole <dig> . one arm  mainly uses acidic side-chains to interact with the basic side-chains of cole <dig>  the second arm is more conserved and interacts with the partner using also main-chain atoms. from the contact map of the x-ray structure, reported in figure 3a, it is clear that im <dig> and cone <dig> proteins interact through their central regions, i.e. residues 510- <dig> of cole <dig> and 20- <dig> of im <dig> .

as already mentioned, the interaction between the two partners is very specific and strong, presenting an experimental gibbs free-energy of binding equal to - <dig>  kcal/mol  <cit> . both proteins present high percentage of hydrophilic residues at the binding interface. our cocomaps  <cit>  analysis revealed that  <dig> of the total  <dig> ics indeed occur between two hydrophilic residues, while only one of them involves the two hydrophobic residues significantly buried at the interface, namely val27/im <dig> and val523/cole <dig>  importantly, fifteen direct hydrogen bonds are found at the interface, five of them being salt bridges. the asn <dig> and asp <dig> residues of im <dig> contribute significantly to the h-bonds network, the former one participating in three h-bonds, the latter one giving two salt bridges with cole <dig> arg <dig> and lys <dig>  clearly, the charged residues at the interface play an important role in the interaction. it was shown that the triple mutant of im <dig> where asp <dig>  asp <dig> and glu <dig> are mutated to asn/gln completely lacks in vivo inhibitory activity against cole <dig>  with inhibitory effect of the residues in the order asp <dig> > asp <dig> > glu <dig>  <cit> . additionally, two im <dig> tyrosines in the middle of the biological interface, tyr <dig> and tyr <dig>  also seem to play a crucial role  <cit> . they contribute one intermolecular h-bond each, but also give hydrophobic interactions with cole <dig>  in particular, tyr <dig> is 98% and tyr <dig> 73%buried upon the complex formation, being inserted into cole <dig> non-polar pockets .

md simulations and mdcons analysis. as an indicative measure of the stability and conformational drift of the complex in the simulation, the rmsd of the c-alpha atoms from their initial position was monitored as a function of the simulation time and is reported in the additional file  <dig>  the rmsd trend quickly reaches a plateau at  <dig>  Å after the equilibration steps, indicating that the system remains stable during the 100-ns long simulation. the radius of gyration rγ, a property linked to the molecular volume and compactness, is also very stable after few ns, showing a very limited variation and indicating that the complex does not undergo significant conformational changes . the good convergence of the simulation is reflected by the high root mean square inner product  value,  <dig> , calculated between the first  <dig> principal component vectors of the two halves of the trajectory.

the overall conservation of the interface during the dynamics can be visually appreciated by the comparison of the md consensus map and the inter-molecular contact map of the x-ray structure  and is reflected by the c <dig> and c <dig> values. the mdcons analysis results in c <dig> and c <dig> values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , which means that 84% and 69% of the ics are conserved in at least 70% and 90% of the frames, respectively, thus indicating a limited flexibility of the interface during the dynamics. in particular, of the total  <dig> ics present in the x-ray structure,  <dig> are maintained in all the examined frames . these include contacts between residues involved in  <dig> out of the total  <dig> direct inter-molecular hydrogen bonds. the interactions between tyr55/im <dig> and the side chain of lys528/cole <dig>  and between pro57/im <dig> and ser514/cole <dig> are also fully conserved. as a remark, these contacts are driven by van der waals interactions, for example between the aliphatic part of the lys <dig> side chain and the aromatic ring of tyr <dig>  with no evidence of a h-bond or a π-cation interaction between the amino group of lys <dig> and the oh group or the aromatic ring of ty <dig> in the examined frames. this highlights that tools based on the detection of standard interaction motifs, such as h-bond or π-cation interaction, would completely miss this strongly maintained contact  <cit> .

the remaining  <dig> ics exhibit crkl in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> . the least conserved ics, among those observed in the x-ray structure, correspond to asn26/im7-val523/cole <dig> , leu34/im7-lys525/cole <dig> , asp35/im7-thr539/cole <dig>  and asp35/im7-lys528/cole <dig> . the first three interactions are non-specific and located at the external boundaries of the binding interface. contributing residues are at a minimum distance above  <dig> Å in the x-ray structure. therefore their low conservation is consistent with a small fluctuation of the two proteins around their recognition interface. the last one is instead surprisingly a salt bridge, which is clearly completely lost during the md simulations. as we contemporarily found a conservation rate of  <dig>  between asp35/im <dig> and lys537/cole <dig> giving no h-bond in the x-ray structure , we decided to monitor the distances between the functional groups of asp <dig> of im7and lys528/lys <dig> of cole <dig> in the time, from which it is clear that the salt-bridge between asp35/im <dig> and lys528/cole <dig> is rapidly lost during the simulation and replaced by a asp35/im <dig> salt-bridge with lys537/cole <dig> . lys537/cole <dig> also establishes a salt-bridge with glu39/im <dig> that is more than  <dig> Å apart in the x-ray structure , as shown in the inset of figure  <dig> for frame  <dig>  corresponding to  <dig>  ns of simulation. therefore, quite surprisingly, some variability in the complex salt-bridge network emerges during the dynamics simulation, around the crucial negatively charged asp35/im <dig> residue.

interestingly, during the dynamics some additional ics raise, which are not present in the starting x-ray structure . in total we observe  <dig> of these contacts, but the majority of them are observed only in a small fraction of snapshots, as only  <dig> of them have a conservation rate of  <dig>  or above. only two 'novel' interactions are very well conserved during the simulations, having a conservation rate around  <dig> , they are glu39/im7-lys537/cole <dig>  and pro48/im7-thr531/cole <dig>  such ics are found at the margins of the interface area and are mostly located in flexible regions of the two molecules, however, as outlined above, one of them interestingly involves charge complementary residues. overall, the interface area slightly expands during the dynamic simulations. the average interface area of the  <dig> snapshots is  <dig> Å <dig> , which compares with the value of  <dig> Å <dig> in the x-ray structure  <cit> , see figure  <dig> 

cd2-cd <dig> complex 
structural overview. the second crystal structure we analyzed is the heterophilic adhesion complex between the amino-terminal domain of human cd <dig>  and its counter-receptor cd <dig>  <cit> . cd <dig> is a transmembrane cell surface glycoprotein found on virtually all t cells, thymocytes and nk cells and promotes the initial stages of opposing cells contact, optimizing immune recognition. the structure includes the n-terminal adhesion domain of human cd <dig>  composed of  <dig> residues , and the n-terminal adhesion domain of cd <dig> composed of  <dig> residues. it is worth noting that strategies aimed to block the cd2-cd <dig> interaction are being developed to treat autoimmune diseases  <cit> , with a recombinant cd58-ig fusion protein already approved for the treatment of chronic plaque psoriasis in adults  <cit> . as already mentioned, the binding affinity of the immunoglobulin -like domains cd2-cd <dig> is relatively low, with an experimental gibbs free-energy of binding equal to - <dig>  kcal/mol  <cit> . moreover, very rapid koff and kon rates have been measured for the system  <cit> . actually, in this complex a strikingly asymmetric, orthogonal, face-to-face interaction is revealed, involving the major β-sheet of the respective immunoglobulin- like domains with poor shape complementarity   <cit> .

from the contact map of the x-ray structure , we can see at a glance that cd <dig> mainly uses its 20- <dig> region for the interaction, plus a small segment around residues 78- <dig>  whereas cd <dig> interacts with regions 25- <dig> and 80- <dig>  as reported in the x-ray structure reference  <cit> , the cd2-cd <dig> complex presents fifteen hydrogen bonds at the interface, including  <dig> salt-bridges, involving the cd <dig> residues arg <dig>  lys <dig> and asp <dig> and the cd <dig> residues glu <dig>  glu <dig> and arg <dig>  only three hydrophobic residues are found at the interface, phe46/cd <dig>  pro80/cd <dig> and tyr86/cd <dig>  each involved in few van der waals contacts. the interface is thus dominated by charged and hydrophilic residues. in fact, by cocomaps analysis, we found that  <dig> of the total  <dig> ics characterizing the complex occur between two hydrophilic residues, corresponding to the 66% of them, while only one of them involves two hydrophobic residues. the interface area of the x-ray structure is  <dig> Å <dig> 

md simulations and mdcons analysis. rmsd of the c-alpha atoms from their initial position, and the radius of gyration rγ of the system are reported in the additional file  <dig>  both measures indicate that the complex is stable during the dynamics simulation. the rmsd values are pretty stable on values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  Å, although more fluctuating than the 7cei ones in the first half of the simulation, where it reaches maximum values of  <dig>  Å. the radius of gyration rγ is also stable. it assumes an absolute value very close to that of the 7cei system, although showing a slightly higher fluctuation. also for this simulation, a high rmsip value,  <dig> , was calculated, indicating that it is very well converged.

the c <dig> and c <dig> parameters assume the values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively , that means that only 78% of ics are maintained in at least 70% of the frames and only 49% in at least 90% of them, indicating a certain variability of the ics during the simulation. this is also apparent from the complex consensus map , where it is clear that additional spots appear as compared to the contact map of the x-ray structure, i.e. additional ics are established during the simulation, while most ics of the x-ray structure are not fully conserved .

of the  <dig> ics observed in the x-ray structure, only  <dig>  are indeed rigidly maintained  during the md simulation. these include only  <dig> of the  <dig> intermolecular hydrogen bonds, showing that the remaining  <dig> hydrogen bonds cannot be established at least in some of the explored frames, as the corresponding residues are more that  <dig> Å apart. among the 100% conserved ics there are also some substantially hydrophobic ones, which cannot be easily characterized with standard analysis tools based on, for example, the characterization of hydrogen-bonds at the interface. for instance, the ics between phe46/cd <dig> and gly90/cd <dig> and the one between the aromatic ring of tyr86/cd <dig> and the aliphatic portion of lys34/cd <dig> have a crkl =  <dig> . the remaining  <dig> ics of the starting x-ray structure exhibit crkl in the range  <dig>  to  <dig> . the least conserved ics, among those observed in the x-ray structure, arg48/cd2-arg44/cd <dig> , arg48/cd2-phe46/cd <dig>  and arg48/cd2-lys34/cd <dig> , all involve arg <dig> of cd <dig> in the central region of the cd <dig> binding interface . the disruption of this network of interactions is probably due to repulsive electrostatic interaction between arg47/cd <dig> on one side, and arg <dig> and lys <dig> of cd <dig> on the other side.

interestingly, during the dynamics  <dig> additional ics are established, which are not present in the starting x-ray structure, as can easily be seen from the corresponding consensus map shown in figure 6b. ten of them have a crkl above  <dig>  and  <dig> of them are very well conserved, exhibiting crkl values above  <dig> . they include ics made by residues located at the boundary of the binding interface, such as lys41/cd <dig> and lys43/cd <dig>  andpro80/cd <dig> and asn81/cd <dig>  but also residues in the middle of the interface, such as tyr <dig> in cd <dig> and leu <dig> and glu <dig> in cd <dig> . from the consensus map , it is also easy to spot a new contact region around residue  <dig> of both proteins. in particular, novel contacts emerge between lys82/cd <dig> and glu78/cd <dig>  and between tyr86/cd <dig> and glu78/cd <dig> . these also are ics in the middle of the binding interface.

in a small fraction of snapshots , we observed ics between residues, such as lys91/cd <dig> and phe49/cd <dig>  which are more than  <dig> Å apart in the crystallographic structure, clearly indicating a significant flexibility of the complex interface, not captured by the rmsd or the rγ. differently from 7cei, for 1qa <dig> the interface area is slightly reduced during the dynamics. the average interface area of the  <dig> snapshots is indeed 641Å <dig> , that is  <dig> Å <dig> less than the x-ray one, 676Å <dig>  <cit> , see figure  <dig> 

comparison between the two complexes
mdcons analysis of the two structures highlights a higher flexibility and variability in the interface of cd2-cd <dig> relative to that of im7-cole <dig>  this can easily be appreciated by comparing the consensus maps obtained for the two systems  and is reflected in the lower values of c <dig>  c <dig> and c <dig> parameters obtained for cd2-cd <dig> . specifically, while the c <dig> and c <dig> of cd2-cd <dig> are marginally smaller than those calculated for im7-cole <dig>  its c <dig> is significantly smaller . furthermore, only  <dig> ics at the interface of the cd2-cd <dig> complex, corresponding to 24% of the contacts observed in the x-ray structure, are 100% conserved during the dynamics, which compares with the  <dig> fully conserved ics at the interface of im7-cole <dig>  corresponding to 37% of the contacts of the x-ray structure . finally, the fraction of x-ray contacts with a crkl<  <dig>  is 12% for 7cei, indicating that only a few contacts are basically lost during the md simulation, a value that increases to the clearly higher value of 26% for 1qa <dig> 

overall, the above analysis clearly indicates that the ics of 1qa <dig> are somewhat more flexible than those of 7cei, highlighting a more dynamic behavior of the interface of 1qa <dig>  furthermore, the average interface area of 1qa <dig> is reduced relative to the x-ray structure during the md simulation, whereas the 7cei one experiences a small increase .

both systems acquire novel ics during the md simulations, not observed in the x-ray structure . precisely,  <dig> and  <dig> novel contacts are observed for 1qa <dig> and 7cei, respectively. however, in cd2-cd <dig> the novel established ics do not compensate the ones lost compared to the starting x-ray structure and the interface area is consequently reduced by about  <dig> Å <dig>  on the contrary, the interface area of the im7- cole <dig> complex is increased on average by  <dig> Å <dig> during the md simulation.

once they were outlined by mdcons, we could follow and characterize the ics that exhibited a significant variation compared to the x-ray structure by classical analysis tools, such as distance monitoring along the simulation. results of this analysis surprisingly showed that the salt-bridge network of im7-cole <dig> is quite dynamic, with asp35/im <dig> losing its h-bond with lys528/cole <dig> during the dynamics, and acquiring one novel h-bond with lys537/cole <dig>  which in turns rearranges its side-chain to also give a h-bond with glu39/im <dig> 

it is interesting that we found a poor conservation in terms of ics for the interface of the human cd2-cd <dig> complex and a decrease in its extension, compared to the static 3d structure, as it has been experimentally shown to have very rapid on and off kinetic rates and to exchange to new partners, after dissociation, rather than rebind to the same cd2-cd <dig> pair components  <cit> . the rapid off rate of cd2-cd <dig> has previously been hypothesized to be related to the virtual absence of hydrophobic contacts at the interface. however, this is a feature that such complex shares with many other complexes, including the im7-cole <dig> one analysed here. we suggest that the cd2-cd <dig> peculiar binding behavior could also be related to the dynamics of the cd <dig> and cd <dig> proteins in the complex, that spontaneously lose a significant fraction of contacts while exploring novel ones.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed md simulations on two protein complexes with interfaces of comparable area and both dominated by hydrophilic residues. to analyse the results of the simulations we used some classical tools and a novel tool, mdcons , we specifically developed for the analysis of the md trajectories of protein complexes. the two systems under analysis correspond to the high binding affinity im7-cole <dig> structure and to the low affinity cd2-cd <dig> complex. analysis through the mdcons tool allowed us to outline interesting dynamic features at the interface of both the analysed complexes, evidencing overall a more rigid interface for im7-cole <dig>  and a relatively more flexible and dynamic interface for the cd2-cd <dig> complex. we have thus demonstrated the utility of mdcons in complementing classical analysis tools, when studying the dynamics of protein complexes. this approach can also be straightforwardly applied to other macromolecular complexes, such as dna-protein and rna-protein complexes.
