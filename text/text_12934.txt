BACKGROUND
in august  <dig> a major epidemic of bluetongue virus serotype  <dig>  started off in north-west europe, including the netherlands, belgium, germany, luxembourg and the north of france  <cit> . in order to improve the understanding of the epidemiological situation of this disease, it was necessary to execute a cross-sectional serological study at the end of the vector season of  <dig>  the community legal framework on bluetongue monitoring and surveillance was laid down in council directive 2000/75/ec and commission decision 2005/393/ec and these are in line with the terrestrial animal health code of the oie. cattle were the target species for the cross-sectional serological study at the end of  <dig>  <cit> .

many hoped that the winter season of 2006/ <dig> would halt the btv epidemic, assuming that the chain of transmission would be broken by the dying off of infected adult vectors and a halt in the life cycle of the vector because of low temperatures. however, in the course of  <dig> it became evident that btv <dig> somehow had survived the winter in north-west europe and a re-emerging epidemic spread exponentially within the original affected countries. moreover, btv <dig> was introduced into the united kingdom, denmark, czech republic and switzerland  <cit> .

the scale of the epidemic in  <dig> was so huge that the european union decided to start vaccination against btv <dig> in  <dig>  the vaccination campaign aims to achieve a 80% or more coverage of animals protected   <cit> .

the sentinel monitoring system, set up at the beginning of  <dig> to detect re-emergence of btv <dig>  already provided some insights into the extend of the btv <dig> spread in the cattle population in  <dig>  however, with respect to goats and sheep there was no information on the btv8-seroprevalence in north-west europe. this paper presents the seroprevalence and geographical spread of btv <dig> on animal and herd levels in goats and sheep in the netherlands in  <dig> and  <dig> 

methods
blood samples from dutch sheep and goats were serologically tested at the central veterinary institute  in lelystad for antibodies against btv <dig> using a competitive elisa . this elisa has a high sensitivity  and specificity   <cit> . the blood samples were collected in the framework of obligatory and voluntary health programmes  executed by the dutch animal health service. for the  <dig> seroprevalence estimates, we used blood samples collected in the first months of  <dig>  for the  <dig> seroprevalence estimates, we used blood samples collected in the last months of  <dig>  locations with animal sampled were selected proportional to the population distribution of locations with goats and sheep in the netherlands in the different provinces. sample size within locations for the health programmes was set at detecting at least a prevalence of disease of 5%. in smaller flocks this often meant that almost all animals within the flock were sampled.

there are approximately  <dig>  locations with sheep and  <dig>  locations with goats in the netherlands registered at the animal health service. based on these data and an a priori estimated seroprevalence of btv8-infected locations with goats of 5% and a maximum acceptable error in the estimated prevalence of 5% and a 95% confidence level required for the estimated prevalence, a sample size of approximately  <dig> locations with goats was calculated using winepiscope version  <dig>   <cit>  for our cross-sectional study in  <dig>  for  <dig>  we adjusted the a priori estimated seroprevalence of btv- <dig> infected locations with goats to 30% with a maximum acceptable error in the estimated prevalence of 10% and a 95% confidence level required for the estimated prevalence, resulting in a sample size of approximately  <dig> locations with goats for  <dig>  for the locations with sheep, we used an a priori estimated prevalence of btv8-infected locations with sheep of 10% and a maximum acceptable error in the estimated prevalence of 5%, resulting in a calculated sample size of approximately  <dig> locations with sheep for  <dig>  for  <dig>  we adjusted the a priori estimated seroprevalence to 50% with a maximum acceptable error in the estimated prevalence of  <dig> % and a 95% confidence level required for the estimated prevalence, resulting in a sample size of approximately  <dig> locations. since there is also an unknown number  of small-holder locations in the netherlands with goats and sheep with a small numbers of animals , we arbitrarily increased the actual sample size with approximately  <dig> to 20%. exact confidence intervals for the estimated seroprevalence were calculated according to fleiss  <cit> .

RESULTS
seroprevalence of btv8-infected locations with goats and sheep in 2006
a total of  <dig>  goat sera from  <dig> locations with goats and  <dig>  sheep sera from  <dig> locations with sheep were collected. all goat samples were seronegative, a total of  <dig> sheep samples  from  <dig> locations with sheep  were seropositive. the btv8-seropositve locations with sheep were located in the provinces of limburg, north brabant, zeeland, and gelderland. within-location seroprevalence ranged from  <dig> to 50% . the location of the provinces in the netherlands is shown in figure  <dig>  based on our sampled population we estimated the proportion of btv8-seropositive locations in the netherlands with sheep and goats. on a national level the estimated seroprevalence of btv8-exposed locations in  <dig> was 0% for goats  and  <dig> % for sheep .

seroprevalence of btv8-infected locations with goats and sheep in 2007
a total of  <dig>  goat sera from  <dig> locations with goats and  <dig>  sheep sera from  <dig> locations with sheep were collected. a total of  <dig> goat samples  from  <dig> locations with goats  were seropositive. the btv8-seropositve locations with goats in  <dig> were located in the provinces of north holland, south holland, utrecht, gelderland, north brabant, and limburg.

a total of  <dig>  sheep samples  from  <dig> locations with sheep  were seropositive. the btv8-seropositve locations with sheep were located in all provinces of the netherlands in  <dig>  on a national level the estimated seroprevalence of btv8-exposed locations in  <dig> was 47% for goats  and 70% for sheep . the median within-location seroprevalence on btv8-infected locations with goats was 21%  and with sheep 67%  .

discussion
there is very sparse information on seroprevalence of btv-infected locations with goats and sheep during outbreaks. a cross-sectional study in kazakhstan showed a within-herd seroprevalence in cattle, sheep and goats varying between  <dig> and 100%  <cit> . a cross-sectional study in sheep flocks in northern pakistan  <cit>  indicated 90% of the flocks seropositive. in these seropositive sheep flocks, within-flock seroprevalence ranged from  <dig> to 100% . a cross-sectional serological study in queensland, australia, found within-flock seroprevalences in infected sheep flocks ranging from  <dig> – 42% and in infected goat flocks ranging from  <dig> – 16%  <cit> .

during the 2006-epidemic in north-west europe, no clinically affected goats were reported  <cit> . the results of our seroprevalence study is in line with those findings. however, in week  <dig> of  <dig>  the first clinical disease in goats caused by btv <dig> in north-west europe was reported from the netherlands  <cit> : in a holding containing  <dig> milking goats,  <dig> goats demonstrated clinical signs of bt, starting with acute drop in milk yield and pyrexia, followed by edema of lips and face, crusts on lips and muzzle, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis and erythema of the udder. up to the end of  <dig>  a total of  <dig> holdings reported clinical disease  in goats in the netherlands. the results of our seroprevalence study indicate a seroprevalence of locations with goats of approximately 50% in the netherlands in  <dig>  this is much higher than can be inferred from the  <dig> locations that reported clinical outbreaks in goats in  <dig>  this is probably due to the fact that clinical signs in infected goats are far less obvious than in sheep  <cit> .

in the first year  of the btv8-epidemic in the netherlands, a total of  <dig> sheep flocks and  <dig> cattle herds reported clinical disease. in  <dig>  the epidemic really took off: about  <dig>  clinical outbreaks were reported by locations with sheep on a total of  <dig>  outbreaks reported. the results of the seroprevalence study in sheep in  <dig> and  <dig> are in line with the number of clinical outbreaks reported.

in our study we see a wide range in within-location seroprevalence in locations with goats and sheep. this means that the proportion of animals protected in  <dig> by a natural infection in  <dig> and/or  <dig> can differ highly between locations. two options for a vaccination strategy are open: either one vaccinates all ruminants on the locations with animals irrespective of the proportion of animals protected by a natural infection in  <dig> or  <dig> or one determines the proportion of animals protected by a natural infection within the flock: if a low to moderate proportion of animals is naturally protected one has a good reason to vaccinate all the animals; if a high proportion of animals is naturally protected, this might be a reason not to vaccinate the flock.

CONCLUSIONS
seroprevalence of btv8-exposed locations with goats and locations with sheep was much higher in  <dig> than in  <dig>  there was a much higher estimated seroprevalence of locations with goats exposed to btv <dig> than can be inferred from the rather low number of reported clinical outbreaks in goats. this is probably due to the fact that clinical signs in infected goats are far less obvious than in sheep. there was a wide range in within-location seroprevalence in locations with goats and sheep. this means that the proportion of animals protected in  <dig> by a natural infection in  <dig> and/or  <dig> can differ highly between flocks. this should be taken into account when vaccinating animals.
