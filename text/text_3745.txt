BACKGROUND
despite the crucial role that heterosis has played in crop improvement over the years, its genetic and molecular bases are still elusive  <cit> . several types of structured populations, such as ril  populations, have been widely used to discover the genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes, including heterosis. numerous qtl  for yield and/or yield components related to heterosis were detected in maize  <cit>  as well as in several other species  <cit> , showing a variety of effects ranging from dominance at various levels to epistasis. however, qtl analysis in structured populations has not been able yet to provide a definite answer on the genetic nature of hybrid vigor. in fact, whereas structured populations are statistically powerful for discovering relevant genomic intervals, they generally lack the statistical power needed for the isolation and the detailed characterization of individual qtl  <cit> . accurate estimation of the effects of qtl, including those for heterotic qtl  <cit> , introgressed into near-isogenic materials is considered the most effective strategy for their characterization and the identification of their molecular bases; this in turn could allow incorporating specific qtl into effective breeding programs  <cit> . near-isogenic lines  and introgression lines   <cit>  are suitable genetic materials to this aim, and can be used as a resource to initiate positional cloning projects and to address more general questions regarding epistatic interactions, genome organization and genetic linkage. general-purpose nil or il panels have been developed for qtl analyses in maize, such as those obtained in crosses between b <dig> and tx <dig>  <cit> , between b <dig> and gaspe flint  <cit>  and between b <dig> and mo <dig>  <cit> , with the aim of providing tools for validating qtl and for initiating fine-mapping experiments.

 in previous work undertaken to shed light on the genetic basis of heterosis in maize, we performed a qtl analysis on genetic materials derived from a ril-f12: <dig> population derived from the single cross b73 × h <dig>  <cit> . the level of heterosis underlying genetic effects for several agronomic traits was evaluated, and a number of qtl with heterotic effects on phenotypes were detected. with the aim of identifying the molecular determinants underlying heterotic qtl, we undertook an introgression program based on residual heterozygous lines to develop on-purpose near-isogenic materials  <cit>  suitable for the fine characterization of qtl chosen for their over-dominance effects  <cit> . in particular, following the crossing-and-selection approach schematized in figure  <dig>  we obtained pairs of nils designed to have contrasting genotypes at the selected qtl regions within an otherwise isogenic recombinant genetic background . the presence of heterotic phenotypes in these nils was validated in different genetic combinations and growing conditions  <cit> . in the perspective of fine mapping the introgressed heterotic qtl, we chose to focus our efforts on the five nil pairs introgressing qtl  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  in different genetic backgrounds ; these showed over-dominance for grain yield and number of kernels per plant, which are important agronomic and economic traits. figure  <dig> summarizes the performance of these five nil pairs and their hybrids obtained in our previous studies comprising six field trials with two replications per trial . results refer to grain yield per plant and its component number of kernels per plant, the two traits exhibiting the highest level of heterosis. field performance is expressed as percentage of the parental mean, to allow a comparison among qtl effects. our data clearly shows that the heterozygote was significantly superior at least to the parental mean in all instances but kernel per plant for  <dig>  r <dig>  in two cases,  <dig>  r <dig> and  <dig>  r <dig>  the heterozygote was even strongly superior to the best homozygote. taken together, these data corroborate our previous observations  <cit> , justifying the more detailed investigation here presented on these nils. in fact, although designed as pairs of inbred lines that ideally differ by a single and well defined region, nils inevitably contain a variable proportion of non-isogenic genome. this is mainly due to linkage drag, that carries segments linked to the one targeted for introgression, and to the presence of other residual unlinked non-isogenic genomic fragments. therefore, to perform an accurate research, a detailed picture of the genotypic structure of the genetic material under study is paramount. among the numerous genotyping techniques available, those based on highly parallelized polymorphisms detection are better suited to efficiently tackle this goal. the recent completion of the maize genome reference sequence  <cit> , allowing the physical mapping of snps  and other variations to the maize chromosomes, set the path for the development and testing of highly informative, easy to use and robust genotyping platforms for this species. these platforms are based either upon comparative genomic hybridization , which also allows the detection of copy number variations  relative to the reference genome  <cit> , genotyping by sequencing  methods  <cit>  or large scale snp genotyping arrays  <cit> . the latter platform, developed by illumina, inc.  under the name of maizesnp <dig> beadchip, is based on snp markers selected to be preferentially located in genes and evenly distributed across the genome and it has been tested with a large set of maize germplasm, including north american and european inbred lines, parent/hybrid combinations, and distantly related teosinte materials.

here we describe the results of the detailed genotyping, obtained by using the illumina maizesnp <dig> beadchip  <cit> , of five nil pairs that we specifically produced  <cit>  for the introgression of three heterotic qtl  <cit> . the objectives of this study were:  to assess the reliability of the maizesnp <dig> beadchip platform and determine its descriptive power on the yet untested b73 × h <dig> genetic system;  to establish the detailed genetic structure of five nil pairs produced to introgress three heterotic qtl in different recombinant genetic backgrounds;  to verify the presence of the expected genotypes within the target qtl introgression regions;  to compare genotypic patterns within nil pairs in order to estimate the extent and position of residual non-isogenic genomic regions.

RESULTS
snp quality control and genomic distribution in the b <dig> × h <dig> genetic system
before proceeding to the genetic characterization of nils, we assessed the reliability of the maizesnp <dig> beadchip platform and determined its descriptive power on the yet untested b73 × h <dig> genetic system. to this aim, we performed thorough quality controls of snps and analyzed their genomic distribution based upon the genotypic calls obtained for the nils’ parental inbred lines , for their f <dig> hybrid and for two reference b <dig> samples.

in order to assess the consistency of snp genotype calls across replicate samples, we compared to each other the two b <dig> reference samples included as internal controls in the experiment . they were identical for all the  <dig>  considered snps and were subsequently treated as a single sample . b <dig> sample was then compared to inbred line b <dig> from scuola superiore sant’anna  in order to determine the level of divergence between samples from different seed stocks. the full list of the b <dig> vs. b73-ssa compared snp genotypes is available in additional file  <dig>  a total of  <dig> and  <dig> snps showed a heterozygous genotype in either b <dig> or b73-ssa, respectively. the vast majority of snps  showed an identical genotype between the two b <dig> samples,  <dig> snps being heterozygous in both samples. the discordant genotypes at the remaining  <dig> snps  were due either to a heterozygous state in one sample but not in the other  or to discordant homozygous genotypes . ninety-five percent  of the total discordant snps were mapped among chromosomes  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , most of them being within single uninterrupted clusters covering in total about  <dig> mbp along intervals  <dig> – <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig>   <dig> – <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> and  <dig> – <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> 

before proceeding to the analysis of the genetic structure of nils, a working subset of  <dig>  good quality snps  was identified by applying stringent quality filtering criteria which also considered pedigree consistency  to the full snp dataset . briefly, the following number of snps were excluded at each subsequent filtering step:  <dig>  failed in all samples;  <dig>  failed in any samples among b73-ssa, h <dig> and b73-ssa × h <dig> f <dig> hybrid;  <dig> unmapped or mapped to the unknown chromosome;  <dig> heterozygous in either of the nil parental lines ;  <dig> having inconsistent genotypes in the b73-ssa × h <dig> f <dig> hybrid; and, finally,  <dig> having inconsistent genotype in nils samples.

the descriptive power of the maizesnp <dig> beadchip with respect to the b73 × h <dig> genetic system was assessed by determining the genomic distribution of the snp working set among and within the maize chromosomes . the distribution of the  <dig>  snps  was found significantly non-uniform among chromosomes due to a significant higher- and lower-than-expected number of snps in chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the same pattern was also observed when considering all the  <dig>  snps with known chromosome position originally included in the chip , indicating that the overall snp distribution was not biased by the applied filtering criteria.

achromosome length over total genome length; bnumber of snps per chromosome over total number of snps; cnumber of polymorphic  and monomorphic  snps over the total number of snps mapped on the respective chromosome; dnumber of polymorphic  and monomorphic  snps over total number snps. up/down arrows indicate the sign of significant  deviations from the expected snp distribution among chromosomes for the corresponding tested null hypotheses, namely: uniform distribution of total snps ; uniform distribution of polymorphic snps ; uniform distribution of monomorphic snps ; independent distribution of polymorphic vs. monomorphic snps from their mapping chromosome .

the comparison of genotype calls between b73-ssa and h <dig> showed that  <dig>  snps, about 35% of the retained snps, are polymorphic between the two inbred lines, with proportions ranging from  <dig> % in chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> % in chromosome  <dig> . the ratios of polymorphic vs. monomorphic snps  resulted overall non-independent from the chromosome where the snps were mapped. pairwise tests indicated that this was due to significant deviations from independence for all chromosomes except chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  in particular, chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> showed pm ratios higher than expected under the hypothesis of independence, whereas the opposite was true for chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  all non-independent pm ratios  could be accounted for by various combinations of significant non-uniform distributions among chromosomes of either the polymorphic  or the monomorphic  snps , or both. for example, the significantly low pm ratio observed in chromosome  <dig> corresponds to a significant depletion of polymorphic snps only, whereas in chromosome  <dig> it is due to polymorphic and monomorphic snps being at the same time, respectively, less and more than expected by their uniform distribution.

the genome-wide distribution of distances between adjacent polymorphic snps is shown in figure  <dig>  the overall mean distance is  <dig> kbp, with means per chromosome ranging from  <dig> kbp in chromosome  <dig> to  <dig> kbp in chromosome  <dig> . half of the polymorphic snps fall within  <dig> kbp from each other and 95% within  <dig> kbp. only  <dig> snp intervals have sizes exceeding  <dig> mbp, 90% of which  being below  <dig> mbp. the maximum snp interval sizes observed per single chromosome range from  <dig>  mbp in chromosome  <dig> to  <dig>  mbp in chromosome  <dig>  noticeably, this latter interval, by far the largest detected , is mapped between two snps at  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp and is centered around the centromere of chromosome  <dig> , the largest annotated maize centromere by a factor of five  <cit> .

polymorphic snps were also found significantly non-uniformly distributed within each of the ten maize chromosomes arbitrarily divided in  <dig> mbp bins . orthogonal pairwise chi-square tests corrected for multiple tests with benjamini-hochberg false discovery rate  allowed us to identify significantly low- and high-polymorphic bins within each chromosome, i.e., bins comprising less or more polymorphic snps than those expected under the null hypothesis of their uniform distribution within each chromosome. a total of  <dig> out of the  <dig> bins  were classified as significantly low-  or high-polymorphic , the former and the latter being preferentially observed in centromeric and telomeric regions, respectively. in fact, the first five bins located at the two telomeres of each chromosome , included  <dig> %  of the high-polymorphic bins and only  <dig> %  of the low-polymorphic ones. conversely, the  <dig> bins per chromosome centered on the bin including the annotated centromere , included  <dig> out of  <dig>  low-polymorphic bins, against only  <dig> out of  <dig>  high-polymorphic ones. noticeably, annotated centromeres map within significantly low-polymorphic bins in all instances except chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  higher resolution  heat-maps representing the distribution on the maize chromosomes of all good-quality snps and of the proportion of polymorphic snps within each bin, respectively, are provided in additional file  <dig> 

assessment of allele inheritance patterns in nils
five pairs of maize recombinant nils were analyzed , each designed to introgress one of three heterotic qtl mapping on chromosome bins  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . each pair consists of two inbred lines, named nil-bb and nil-hh, designed as to introgress the target qtl in the b73/b <dig> and in the h99/h <dig> genotype, respectively . two pairs of nils were available for qtl <dig>  and qtl <dig> , whereas only one pair was produced for qtl <dig> . the full list of snp genotype calls and a summary of genotypes distributions among chromosomes of polymorphic snps in all nil samples are reported in additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  respectively. failure rates in nils averaged  <dig> %, ranging from  <dig> % in nil <dig> _r63-bb to  <dig> % in nil <dig> _r55-hh, with an observed residual heterozygosity of  <dig> % . the lowest and the highest average heterozygosity level per single chromosome were observed in chromosomes  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the genome-wide proportion of b <dig> homozygous snps over all the polymorphic snps ranged between  <dig> % in nil <dig> _r55-hh and  <dig> % in nil <dig> _r8-bb.

graphical representations of the pattern of allelic inheritance along chromosomes of each nil  were obtained by plotting color-coded genotypes of all non-failed polymorphic snp against their positions on the b <dig> refgen_v <dig> maize reference genome  <cit> . qtl regions  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>   include respectively  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> polymorphic good-quality snps on the maize maizesnp <dig> chip, corresponding in the order to snp densities of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  snp/mbp. analysis of snp genotypic data indicates that all target qtl regions were introgressed as expected in all the respective nil pair, i.e., as homogeneous regions of homozygous b73/b <dig> and h99/h <dig> genotypes in nil-bb and nil-hh, respectively.

we evaluated also the cross between nil <dig> _r55-bb and nil <dig> _r55-hh, where the heterozygosity level was the highest detected among all nil materials . out of the  <dig>  polymorphic snps successfully scored in all three samples of set  <dig> _r <dig>  genotype inheritance in nil-bh with respect to the genotype observed in its two parental lines  could be unambiguously confirmed for  <dig>  snps . among these,  <dig> of the  <dig>  heterozygous snps overall detected in nil-bh corresponded to contrasting homozygous genotypes in nil-bb and nil-hh. for the remaining  <dig> non-matching snps , four different situations were observed:  a heterozygous genotype in nil-bh when one of the parents was heterozygous ;  a heterozygous genotype in all three samples ;  a homozygous genotype in nil-bh and contrasting homozygous genotypes in parental nils ;  a homozygous genotype in nil-bh when one of the parents was heterozygous . cases  and  could be accounted for by the co-dominant nature of snp markers , whereas cases  and  are not expected by segregation. however, the fact that the  <dig> snps of case  delimit a region between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> where other  <dig> adjacent snps show consistent genotypes , suggests that in this case the observed genotypic inconsistency might be actually due to snp calling inaccuracy in the nil-bh sample. besides invoking possible snp call errors in any of the three samples, a reasonable explanation for the  <dig> snps of case  could reside in a “sampling effect”, that is, only nil-bh individuals homozygous at these snps were actually genotyped, having been selected by effect of chance among individuals in fact segregating in a 1: <dig> proportion.

assessment of isogenicity in nils
a summary of the number, chromosomal distribution and size of all detected non-isogenic regions is reported in table  <dig>  for the sake of simplicity, the specific chromosome containing the qtl introgressed in each nil was treated separately from the other chromosomes, and no distinction was made between fully homozygous and partially heterozygous non-isogenic regions. with the exclusion of the specific chromosomes containing the qtl introgressed in each pair, the overall number of distinct non-isogenic blocks per nil pair fell between  <dig>  and  <dig> , with an average block length comprised between  <dig>  and  <dig>  mbp in nil pairs  <dig> _r <dig> and  <dig> _r <dig>  respectively. the estimated proportion of non-isogenic genome, also excluding the qtl chromosome, ranged from  <dig> % in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig> to  <dig> % in pair  <dig> _r <dig>  the largest proportions of non-isogenic regions in non-qtl chromosomes were observed for chromosome  <dig> in nil pairs  <dig> _r <dig>  and  <dig> _r <dig> , followed by chromosome  <dig> in pair  <dig> _r <dig> , chromosome  <dig> in pair  <dig> _r <dig> , chromosome  <dig> in pair  <dig> _r <dig> . in three of the remaining cases, non-isogenic regions represented  <dig> to 20% of each chromosome, whereas in all remaining instances they were below 10%. the average observed non-isogenicity per chromosome, excluding in each case the qtl chromosomes in the corresponding nils, was  <dig> % and ranged from  <dig> % in chromosome  <dig>  to  <dig> % in chromosome  <dig> . the largest proportions of non-isogenic regions within qtl specific chromosomes  were observed in both nil pairs for qtl  <dig> , with  <dig> % and  <dig> % in nil r <dig> and r <dig>  respectively. non-isogenicity for the qtl chromosome were very similar to each other for the two nil pairs for qtl  <dig> ,  <dig> % and  <dig> % in pair r <dig> and r <dig> respectively, and much lower than that of the two pairs for qtl  <dig> . finally, the observed residual non-isogenicity in chromosome  <dig> for the nil pair  <dig> _r <dig> was  <dig> %.

number, chromosomal distribution and size of detected non-isogenic blocks in each nil pair are reported. data referring to the chromosomes containing the introgressed qtl for the corresponding nil pair are underlined. astatistics: nb = number of non-isogenic blocks; ns = number of non-isogenic snps; ts = total size of non-isogenic blocks ; cf = non-isogenic chromosome fraction; gf = non-isogenic genome fraction. b <dig> refgen <dig> genome size:  <dig> , <dig>  bp. bqtl introgression regions  are excluded from within-chromosome computations; ctotals are reported both excluding and including  data from the chromosome containing the introgressed qtl in the corresponding nil pair.

the chromosome positions of all non-isogenic regions detected for each nil pair, along with the corresponding snp genotypes of the individual nils can be observed in figure  <dig>  non-isogenic regions of different extent having concordant genotype with the qtl region were found immediately upstream and downstream of the flanking markers defining each qtl region. the presence of these regions could be ascribed to linkage drag effect specifically associated with the markers employed for the introgression of each qtl. non-isogenicity around qtl  <dig>  extended asymmetrically by  <dig>  mbp in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig>  and by  <dig>  mbp in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig> . in the former pair, an additional non-isogenic region of  <dig>  mbp detected further upstream to the qtl region largely overlapped with the more extended non-isogenic region detected in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig>  a comparable linkage drag effect observed in the two genetic backgrounds suggests that it might be specifically associated with the markers employed for introgressing the qtl. in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig>  two additional adjacent non-isogenic regions harboring opposite homozygous genotypes, being probably the effect of two close recombination events around positions  <dig> – <dig>  mbp and  <dig>  mbp, were also detected immediately preceding the upstream non-isogenic extended region, expanding it of additional  <dig>  mbp . in this same nil pair, a small sub-segment within the qtl region  resulted isogenic, and homozygous h99/h <dig>  in the two contrasting nils. non-isogenicity around qtl  <dig>  also extended beyond the qtl boundaries in both nil pairs, also suggesting the presence of linkage drag, although of a more limited extent. in this case, non-isogenic regions extended by about  <dig>  mbp  in nil pair r <dig> and by about  <dig>  mbp  in nil pair r <dig>  albeit non contiguous, the non-isogenic region in pair  <dig> _r <dig> might be considered to extended upstream for further  <dig>  mbp  for a total of about  <dig>  mbp upstream, thus overlapping to a larger extent that of the other qtl  <dig>  nil pair, similarly to what observed above for the qtl  <dig>  nil pairs. finally, the non-isogenic regions flanking qtl  <dig>  region extended about  <dig>  mbp .

additional unlinked non-isogenic regions between contrasting nils were also detected in all pairs and mapped genome-wide. non-isogenic blocks were generally found as stretches of snps of coherent genotypes, whereas recombination within non-isogenic blocks was observed in a few cases only . chromosomal regions having a heterozygous genotype in one of the compared nils only constitute for the most part full independent blocks, being only in fewer instances one of the two boundaries of otherwise larger homozygous non-isogenic blocks. the only exception to this latter situation was observed in nil pair  <dig> _r <dig> for the non-isogenic block mapped at interval  <dig> - <dig>  mbp on chromosome  <dig> , which consists in fact of three sub-blocks, the middle one of which being heterozygous in nil-bb only. only 2– <dig> isolated snps per nil pair are heterozygous in both nils. finally, positions of unlinked non-isogenic blocks across all nil pairs appear to be largely unrelated. a more extended overlapping of non-isogenic blocks could be observed in nil pairs  <dig> _r <dig> and  <dig> _r <dig>  clearly a manifestation of their relatedness since they were developed in the same genetic ril  <dig> background.

discussion
in this study we undertook the analysis of the detailed genotypic structure of near-isogenic materials specifically produced for the introgression of three heterotic qtl in maize that we detected and then further characterized  <cit> . the nil pairs hereby analyzed represent unique material for the study of hybrid vigor in maize, since the analysis of mendelized heterotic qtl might shed light on some relevant, and possibly general, genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon. given this premise, it is paramount that great efforts are made to acquire a detailed knowledge of the genetic structure of such materials, possibly on a whole-genome scale. in fact, accurate determination of the actual isogenicity of nils at a genome-wide level must not be neglected, since conclusions derived on the effects of qtl mendelizing in nil materials largely rely upon it. pursuing this goal, we genotyped the original inbred lines  and the recombinant nils obtained from their cross by the illumina maizesnp <dig> beadchip. this platform allows the scoring of predetermined genotype variants at more than  <dig>  snps selected upon a large maize diversity panel and was recently tested on several us inbred lines  <cit> . the illumina maizesnp <dig> beadchip system was chosen because, in the context of a bi-parental genetic system based on common us inbred lines such as the one under analysis, it provided the best combination of potential information content, technical reliability, and resolution needed to ascertain the overall genetic structure and the level of isogenicity of nils. it has been proposed that heterosis might be associated to large structural variations in the genome leading to complex patterns of gene complementation through the combination of the dispensable genomes within the extremely diverse maize germplasm  <cit> . the platform chosen for the present analysis, differently from others based upon cgh or re-sequencing techniques, is not suited for addressing the study of such variations, which were at this point beyond the scope of the present work, even though they might indubitably be relevant for a closer investigation on the molecular nature of the introgressed qtl.

first of all we compared the genotypic structure of b73-ssa, the inbred line from which all nils were derived, with that of the reference b <dig> accession, for which both replicate snp scoring produced identical results, confirming the technical reproducibility of genotype calls. the few differences detected between b73-ssa and b <dig> were in line with the level of inconsistency already observed with duplicate samples from different seed sources  <cit> . overall, b73-ssa resulted less heterozygous than its reference counterpart, which might reflect an actual higher homozygosity for this accession. a sampling effect cannot be discarded, since the dna of b73-ssa was obtained from a small pool of 5– <dig> seedlings. quality filtering criteria on snps produced  <dig>  good quality snps vs. the  <dig>  snps retained in a previous study including  <dig> maize samples  <cit>  where, as in the present study, a control upon pedigree consistency was made on parent/offspring triplets including the f <dig> hybrid and its parental lines. in our case, this procedure had the additional purpose, due to the lack of replicate samples, to reduce the chances of spurious polymorphism detection and consequent inaccurate genotype calls in nils samples. it must be considered that the quality of the genotyping data was assessed by ganal and coworkers with respect to an average failure rate based on a large sample set  <cit> , rather than on a single comparison as in the present study. despite this difference, however, when removing the  <dig>  snps having a failure rate > 5% from the good quality snps reported by ganal and coworkers, the resulting number of snps  is strikingly similar to that of snps never failed in any sample in the present study , confirming the reliability of the genotyping platform. the application of stringent quality criteria inevitably caused a reduction of the number of snps available to the analysis, with the obvious advantage of providing, on the other hand, a more reliable genotype data set. an indication of this aspect came from the fact that the last filtering step  caused the exclusion of  <dig> additional snps only. snps heterozygous in either of the parental lines were filtered out upon considering both their reduced number, thus their marginal effect on the overall picture, and the fact that their inheritance by descent to the offspring could not be used to unambiguously determine nils’ genotypic structure at the respective loci. no inferences on the presence of null alleles were made upon failed snp calls, in order to avoid both an undesirable increase in the genotyping error rate and the use of dominant-type data which do not allow scoring heterozygosity. the maintenance of the distribution pattern of mapped snps after quality filtering further indicated that the informative content of the chip, although inevitably reduced, was not overall biased by the filtering process.

the number of polymorphic snps detected between b73-ssa and h <dig> inbred lines by the illumina maizesnp <dig> chip was adequate for the purposes of the present study, which was to describe the detailed genetic structure and genotype inheritance patterns in bi-parental materials from them derived. however, no absolute considerations upon the polymorphism level hereby detected between these two lines could be made, nor any comparisons with those previously detected among others. in fact, despite being designed upon a large maize germplasm panel, many of the snp markers present on the illumina maizesnp <dig> chip were selected upon data available from inbred lines b <dig> and mo <dig>  an anomalous high number of polymorphic snps  with respect to previous knowledge about genetic diversity in maize was observed between these two lines when analyzed by this snp platform in the original study on a large maize diversity panel  <cit> . this suggested the presence of an ascertainment bias associated to the design of this snp chip, which has been further confirmed more recently by a diversity analysis extended to a panel of  <dig> elite european inbred lines  <cit> . in the context of germplasm organization, inbreds are commonly assigned to heterotic pools according to estimates of their genetic similarity  <cit> . surprisingly, however, inbred line h <dig>  analyzed in the present work for the first time with this platform, resulted more similar to b <dig> than to mo <dig> , despite the fact that h <dig> and mo <dig> both belong to the lancaster sure crop heterotic group  <cit> .

our analysis showed that the distribution of snps in the genome is in general not uniform. considering in particular the chromosomes bearing the introgressed qtl, chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> showed a high polymorphic vs. monomorphic ratio, in both cases due to a lower than expected number of non-informative monomorphic snps. chromosome  <dig> has also a significant low number of snps when compared to other chromosomes. however, snp density varies sensibly within each chromosome, showing a marked tendency for an over-representation of polymorphic snps in telomeric regions which has been already observed for ibm and lhrf populations  <cit> . this aspect might reflect the constraint in the snp discovery process towards the use of unique, and thus genic, sequences, which tend to be more abundant in telomeric regions. this biased distribution of snps also affected the density of snps within the different introgressed qtl regions. in fact, the number of total snps per mbp is  <dig>  for qtl  <dig>  and  <dig>  for qtl  <dig> , and more than twice as much  for qtl  <dig>  region, which maps at the telomere of long arm of chromosome  <dig>  this relative difference is even larger when considering polymorphic snps only, which are  <dig>  and  <dig>  per mbp for qtl  <dig>  and qtl  <dig> , respectively, against  <dig>  per mbp in qtl  <dig>  region.

the distances between adjacent polymorphic snps between b <dig> and h <dig> present on the chip, being for the vast majority shorter than  <dig> mbp, allowed us to draw detailed maps of the genetic structure of this unique nil material, to our knowledge the only available introgression material for heterotic qtl in maize. first of all, we obtained an accurate definition of the allelic structure at qtl regions, where the successful introgression of coherent chromosome blocks of the expected genotypes within the flanking markers used for marker-assisted selection  was confirmed in all contrasting nils. therefore, polymorphic snps mapping within the qtl introgression regions represent high-density markers that can be used for the fine mapping of the underlying heterotic qtl through the scoring of qtl-specific segregating populations derived from the cross of contrasting lines within each of the nil pairs. recombination events and regions of non-isogenicity were also pinpointed genome-wide for all nil pairs to an unprecedented level of detail, also establishing an invaluable asset towards the characterization and the isolation of the introgressed qtl. in particular, the homogeneous introgression of the same qtl in nil pairs having different, and known, recombinant structures will allow us to undertake a fine mapping approach of qtl  <dig>  and qtl  <dig>  in distinct, yet comparable, near-isogenic segregating populations. such an approach might allow, in turn, the detection of epistatic effects and the isolation of disturbing factors, thus increasing the chances of both characterizing and fine mapping these qtl. in the case of nil pairs  <dig> _r <dig> and  <dig> _r <dig>  the target qtl region is interrupted by two and one isogenic regions, respectively. however, experimental evidences show that the qtl effect is still present in both nil pairs  <cit> , suggesting that in both cases the qtl might map within the spared non-isogenic sub-regions, which in turn might represent per se a refinement of qtl  <dig>  mapping position.

in all nils snps were found organized along chromosomes in blocks of different length bearing concordant genotypes, consistent with the presence of coherent bi-parental chromosomal recombination blocks, as expected given the adopted introgression design  <cit> , and further supporting the reliability of the adopted snps genotyping platform. the assessment of the allelic inheritance patterns at the genome wide-level allowed us to identify unforeseen non-isogenic regions present outside the target qtl regions in contrasting nils. these regions generally consisted of clusters of adjacent snps having coherent contrasting genotypes, rather than being made of isolated discordant snps. non-isogenic regions were found immediately flanking both sides of all target qtl, largely due to the effects of linkage drag associated with the specific markers used for mas. these effects appear to be specific to the markers used for introgression, since non-isogenic regions of comparable size were observed flanking the same qtl independently introgressed in different ril backgrounds . the fact that the effects of linkage drag might be correlated to variable recombination rates along chromosomes is supported by data produced using the same genotyping platform in two maize recombinant populations  <cit> . the large linkage drag observed on the centromeric side of qtl  <dig>  in both nil pairs corresponds to a chromosomal region of low recombination rate as compared to the region on the telomeric side of the qtl. this latter region in fact is characterized by a much more limited linkage drag in both nil pairs introgressing qtl  <dig> . the higher recombination rate associated to the telomere of chromosome  <dig> long arm might instead account for the more limited extension of linkage drag associated to qtl  <dig> . finally, a region of exceptionally low recombination rate immediately surrounded by areas of high recombination rate roughly corresponds to the introgression region of qtl  <dig> . the former characteristic  would explain the consistency of genotypes observed for the contrasting nils along the whole length of this extended introgression region, whereas the latter  might account for the very limited linkage drag observed for this region.

the non-isogenic regions detected in other parts of the genome are randomly distributed and, from the comparison between nil pairs introgressing the same qtl in distinct backgrounds, do not appear to be related to the qtl introgression procedure. they rather seem to largely reflect the presence of different residual heterozygous regions peculiar to the single bc1-s <dig> individuals from which the progenitors of the contrasting nils in each pair were selected, although other random effects that possibly occurred throughout the inbreeding and selection scheme adopted for the qtl introgression cannot be excluded. the remarkable genotypic similarity observed between nil pairs having a common ancestor  clearly shows that sizes and distribution of recombination blocks reflect the genetic structure of the specific ril genotype originating each nil pair. however, despite the fact that nils were produced through the same breeding scheme, different level of non-isogenicity were observed in different pairs. this can be ascribed to the effective residual heterozygosity of the single progenitor f4: <dig> sister plants employed for the independent introgression procedures that led to the production of each nil pair  <cit> . the average proportion of non-shared alleles over all the polymorphic snps  should roughly coincide with the fraction of the genome, also excluding the qtl target region, expected to be heterozygous when crossing contrasting nils within a pair. this was in fact what we observed for nil pair  <dig> _r <dig>  where the proportion of non-shared alleles between the contrasting nils was  <dig> % against an observed residual heterozygosity of  <dig> % in their hybrid .

CONCLUSIONS
the adopted snp genotyping strategy allowed us to draw detailed maps of the genetic structure of unique nil materials introgressing agronomically relevant heterotic qtl, to establish the successful introgression of the expected genotypes in target qtl regions in all nils pairs and to detect residual regions of non-isogenicity genome-wide. effects of linkage drag were found to be related to some extent to the particular region of introgression, whereas other residual non-isogenic regions appeared not to be related to the marker-assisted introgression procedure. the results of this work clearly show that the level of isogenicity and the genetic architecture of near-isogenic materials cannot, and must not, be taken for granted on the sole assumption of theoretical expectations. on the contrary, a detailed molecular characterization of nil materials, possibly during the introgression process and surely on the final products, is a paramount pre-requisite for a successful mendelization and, eventually, isolation of target qtl.

the extensive characterization of the nil materials here presented constitutes an invaluable asset towards the characterization and the isolation of the introgressed heterotic qtl. in fact, the integration of the high-density snp markers identified within the qtl introgression regions and of the genomic information gathered on the architecture of these nils will greatly improve the scope of future experimental programs aimed at the fine mapping and isolation of major heterotic qtl, a crucial step towards the understanding of the molecular bases of heterosis in maize.
