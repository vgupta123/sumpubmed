BACKGROUND
morbillivirus infection affects mainly the upper respiratory tract, central nervous system and the immune system  <cit>  and has been identified as a cause of death and stranding in marine mammals  <cit> . in odontecetes, infection has been associated with high mortality rates occurring during disease outbreaks in different parts of the world  <cit> . the mortality rate in striped dolphins from the mediterranean sea in the beginning of the nineties was the highest recorded so far  <cit> . further studies are needed to deepen the knowledge about this disease. an integrated approach taking into consideration epidemiological and environmental parameters should provide a better picture of the ecology and evolution of cetacean morbillivirus  in free-ranging cetaceans  <cit> .

cemv includes three well characterized viral strains  <cit> : porpoise morbillivirus , dolphin morbillivirus  and pilot whale morbillivirus ; three novel cetacean morbillivirus strains were recently reported , adding to the genetic diversity of these viruses.

morbilliviruses affecting cetaceans have been described in the last decades  <cit>  after the initial detection of viral antigens in these species in the late eighties. the first evidence of morbillivirus infection in cetaceans occurred in  <dig> during a pmv outbreak, when the viral antigen was detected in harbour porpoises  stranded in ireland  <cit> . in the early nineties, dolphin morbillivirus  was isolated from striped dolphins from the mediterranean  <cit> ; in  <dig> pwmv was first described in a long-finned pilot whale  from the us coast  <cit>  and later, in  <dig>  from a short-finned pilot whale  in the canary islands  <cit> .

due to the virus pathogenic impact on cetacean populations, further information about morbillivirus infection in cetaceans worldwide is relevant to understand its epidemiology in these animals. studying infectious diseases in these species is important, especially considering that additional non-infectious aggressions, mainly due to human activities, render these populations even more susceptible to disease. an annual average of  <dig> stranded cetaceans were registered between  <dig> and  <dig>  considering the algarve and the northern region of the portuguese continental coast  <cit>  and fisheries bycatch was identified as the most significant cause of death. to this date, no molecular data was published on morbillivirus infection in animals stranded in portugal or northern spain. in  <dig>  dolphin morbillivirus infection was reported in a retrospective study affecting striped dolphins and a common dolphin from the canary islands  <cit> , causing non-suppurative meningoencephalitis. also, a fatal systemic morbillivirus infection was detected in a bottlenose dolphin stranded in  <dig> in the canary islands  <cit> . it was suggested that dmv was not endemic in harbour porpoises and common dolphins  from the ne atlantic  in the period 1996– <dig>  <cit> , as low antibodies titres were detected in animals from spain and the north sea.

dmv infection apparently did not persist as an endemic infection in mediterranean striped dolphins after the 1990– <dig> epidemic  <cit> . both epidemics in the mediterranean sea  started near the gibraltar strait  <cit>  and it has been suggested that dmv-infected cetaceans may have entered the strait of gibraltar and infected striped dolphins, the most common cetacean at the time  <cit> . pilot whales had been already proposed as reservoirs in  <dig>  <cit> . later, in  <dig> several long-finned pilot whales were found stranded along the coast of the alborean sea,and morbillivirus infection was detected  <cit> . in this epidemic, deaths were first detected close to the gibraltar strait and spread further into the mediterranean sea. recently described sequences found in striped dolphins from the canary islands show high identity with sequences from the mediterranean outbreaks, indicating the possible circulation of viruses between the atlantic and the mediterranean  <cit> . the role of other cetacean species as reservoirs needs to be further assessed.

the objective of the present study was to clarify not only the prevalence of dmv in cetacean populations from the eastern atlantic, but also to investigate the relationship between the dolphin morbillivirus circulating in the eastern atlantic and elsewhere in the world, especially in the mediterranean.

methods
sample collection
stranded cetaceans were collected by the sociedade portuguesa de vida selvagem  in northern portugal and the algarve within the marine animal stranding network, managed by the instituto para a conservação da natureza e florestas  and in galicia by the coordinadora para o estudo dos mamiferos mariños . permission was issued by the national authority  to spvs technicians to collect wildlife samples within the national territory according to laws n.140/ <dig>  n.49/ <dig>  n.156-a/ <dig>  and n.316/ <dig>  also, spvs is a registered cites scientific research institution . cemma holds a permit from the conselleria de medio ambiente, territorio e infraestruturas de xunta de galicia  to collect and maintain cetacean samples according to law 42/ <dig> and law 9/ <dig> 

the animals were assigned a decomposition code  according to already established protocols  <cit> . animals with a score ranging from to  <dig> to  <dig>  were surveyed in the present study. during necropsy, tissue samples were collected from  <dig> cetaceans: brain, lung, pulmonary lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, spleen, kidney and liver, whenever possible. for animals from galicia the only available sample was the lung. samples collected in portugal were stored in vials with rnalater® at −20 °c and samples collected in galicia were frozen at −20 °c. all samples were kept in the marine animals’ tissue banks  of spvs and cemma. samples from different species were collected between  <dig> and 2015: common dolphins , striped dolphins , bottlenose dolphins , long-finned pilot whales , pigmy sperm whale , true’s beaked whale  and fin whale  . samples were identified with a code composed by the species identification , a number attributed to each stranding, and the year of stranding. from cetaceans stranded in the portuguese coastline  <dig> animals from  <dig>   <dig> from  <dig>   <dig> from  <dig>   <dig> from  <dig> and  <dig> from  <dig> were tested. from galicia, a total of  <dig> lung samples from striped dolphins were tested. available tissue samples from  <dig> animals stranded in portugal from previous years were also included in this study .table  <dig> number of stranded cetaceans tested for dmv per year



total rna extraction
total rna was extracted from a pool of tissue homogenates using rneasy mini kit , according to the manufacturer’s instructions. the pool included, whenever possible: lung, brain, pulmonary lymph node and mesenteric lymph node. total rna quantification and purity was determined using a nanodrop 2000c spectrophotometer  and stored at −80 °c until used.

detection of dolphin morbillivirus genomic rna by reverse transcription-quantitative pcr 
the detection of viral rna for the dmv strain of cemv was performed by rt-qpcr in a steponeplus thermocycler , using primers  and probe , targeting the n gene of dmv, as previously described  <cit>  . a previously detected positive sample for dmv was used as a positive control of the pcr reaction. negative reaction controls were always included.table  <dig> primers and probe set used in rt-qpcr assays



one step rt-qpcr assays were performed using 100 ng of the template rna, in a total reaction volume of 20 μl containing: 10 μl of 1-step qpcr-rox mix ; 1 μl of rt enhancer;  <dig>  μl of verso enzyme mix ;  <dig>  μm of each primer and  <dig>  μm of probe. for positive samples, total rna was extracted individually for each of the available organs and the infection was evaluated individually in the different organs. the amplified dmv fragment was cloned into a plasmid vector  and serial tenfold dilutions of the recombinant plasmid dna were used to construct the standard curve . the results showed a high correlation  with a calculated efficiency of 81 %. the primers and probe could detect viral rna copies down to  <dig>  and the limit of detection was  <dig> copies.fig.  <dig> standard curve and equation for the determination of the efficiency of the rt-qpcr for the molecular detection of dmv. the n gene fragment obtained in the rt-qpcr reaction was cloned into a plasmid vector  and serial tenfold dilutions of the recombinant plasmid dna were amplified by qpcr in duplicate reactions and used to construct the standard curve. y axis represents the mean ct values obtained from the duplicates and x axis represents the log <dig> of calculated copy numbers . calculated efficiency of 81 % was determined using the formula: efficiency =  <dig> x . results showed a high correlation 



conventional pcr for amplification of dmv genes
additional sequences were amplified from the positive samples by conventional reverse transcription-pcr  using previously described primers  purchased from stabvida genomics lab . primers were used in different combinations, targeting different genomic regions .table  <dig> primers used in conventional pcr assays

the obtained amplicons were used to perform a phylogenetic analysis of the dmv sequences, along with sequences retrieved from ncbi for the same genes. l and m genes were not targeted in the conventional rt-pcr since very few sequences were available at the ncbi database.

the amplicons were directly sequenced by sanger sequencing at stabvida, portugal and the specificity of the nucleotide sequences was compared by blast analysis http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast.cgi with cemv sequences available in the genbank.

six sets of alignments were considered for the phylogenetic analysis: nucleotide sequence alignments for genes n, p, f and h, composed by sequences of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> base pairs, respectively; concatenated sequence of amino acids  and nucleotides . due to heterogeneity of the available dmv sequences it was not feasible to maintain the same set of dmv sequences in the alignment for each gene. in the concatenated alignment only the sequences with all partial genomic regions were included. the multiple sequence alignments were manually corrected with jalview, version  <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  removing long internal gaps and unmatched ends to maximize genetic similarities and phylogenetic trees were inferred by bayesian methods   <cit> .

for the bayesian analysis a markov chain monte carlo  simulation technique was carried out to approximate the pp of trees  <cit> . the evolutionary gtr  and lg  models were selected with gamma-distributed rate variation across sites and a proportion of invariable sites . the analysis was initiated using a random tree from the dataset with four chains running simultaneously for  <dig> ×  <dig> generations, sampling every  <dig> generations. the first 25 % trees were discarded and a majority rule consensus tree was generated from the remaining trees.

the graphical representation and edition of the phylogenetic tree were performed with figtree v <dig> . <dig>  only support values equal or greater than  <dig>  of pp are shown in the trees.

statistical analysis
chi-square test of association was performed to assess if the difference in prevalence was statistically significant between different species  and between animals from different origins . for this analysis an online website for statistical computation was used url: http://vassarstats.net/. a confidence interval  of 95 %  was considered for all the statistical analysis.

RESULTS
a total of  <dig> dmv positive cetaceans were identified by rt-qpcr, representing a prevalence of  <dig>  % . with respect to the portuguese coastline,  <dig> positive animals were detected, including  <dig> striped dolphins  and  <dig> common dolphins  . in galicia,  <dig> positive striped dolphins were detected . among all cetacean species, striped dolphins  revealed a significantly higher dmv prevalence reaching  <dig>  % , whereas common dolphins  recorded a prevalence of  <dig>  %  . positive striped dolphins were detected every year  while positive common dolphins were only detected in  <dig> and  <dig>  the dmv prevalence in striped dolphins stranded in galicia was  <dig>  %  whereas in portugal the dmv prevalence was  <dig>  % . from the positive animals stranded along the portuguese coastline, each organ included in the tissue pool was tested individually for viral rna. two animals tested positive in all available organs; four were positive for viral rna only in the brain and one animal tested positive in the lung, and in the pulmonary and mesenteric lymph node . lung was the only available sample to test in samples from galicia.table  <dig> mapping of dmv infection in the available organs in portuguese samples

for the nucleotide sequences of each genomic region, phylogenetic trees were inferred by bayesian methods. all trees exhibited a similar sequence topology, supported by robust pp values, regardless of the total number of sequences in each tree.

in the tree of the concatenated nucleotide sequences  the cemv sequences were distributed in three main branches supported by high pp values. portuguese and galician samples from  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were included in one branch; sequences from the mediterranean from  <dig>  early nineties  and the portuguese sequence sc/15/ <dig> in another branch. the only pwmv included in this tree is isolated in a third branch. the tree of the amino acid concatenated sequences presented a similar pattern , although with a rearrangement within the older sequences branch .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for the concatenated nucleotide sequences. phylogenetic tree generated with concatenated nucleotide sequences alignment, inferred by bayesian methods. sequences for the outgroup taxa were retrieved from ncbi for pilot whale morbillivirus ; phocine distemper virus ; canine distemper virus  and measles virus . three dmv sequences were also retrieved from ncbi: one isolate from a pilot whale  and one from a striped dolphin , both from 2007; one isolate from  <dig>  also from a striped dolphin . sequences obtained for animals sc/257/ <dig> , dd/191/ <dig> , sc/53/ <dig> , dd/302/ <dig>  and sc/55/ <dig> , sc/15/ <dig>  were also included in this tree

in the nucleotide tree for the f gene  additional available sequences from the early nineties were included. samples collected in the atlantic during the 2011- <dig> period clustered in the same branch; samples from the nineties clustered in a separate branch, and samples from the mediterranean from  <dig> clustered in a third branch, together with the sample sc/15/ <dig>  similarly to the distribution of the concatenated trees. the pwmv was included in a unique branch. all branches were supported with a high pp values.

for the h gene nucleotide tree , a higher number of sequences were included. a set of sequences  from portugal and galicia ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> clustered in the same branch, supported by a pp value of  <dig> . the sc/15/ <dig> sequence still clustered with mediterranean samples from  <dig> and samples from the early nineties were grouped in a separate branch. the new sequence for pmv included in this tree, branches out from the dmv samples, similarly to the pwmv sequence .

the nucleotide tree for the p gene  contained the higher number of sequences . one sequence from a guiana dolphin  collected in  <dig> in brazil appeared to be a distinct strain from the already characterized strains of cemv  clustered together with a pp value of  <dig> . sequence aj <dig> from a striped dolphin collected in  <dig> in the mediterranean and sequence af <dig> from a pigmy sperm whale from taiwan collected in  <dig> also clustered together . samples from the canary islands collected in  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> clustered with samples from the mediterranean , one sample from new caledonia and one sample from portugal . the remaining portuguese and galician samples clustered in the same clade with two samples with a different origin .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree for the p gene nucleotidic sequences. phylogenetic tree generated with the aligned sequences for the p gene, inferred by bayesian methods. sequences for the outgroup taxa were retrieved from ncbi for pilot whale morbillivirus ; porpoise morbillivirus ; phocine distemper virus ; canine distemper virus  and measles virus . two recently described sequences of cemv  were also included, along with: one isolate of dmv from  <dig> collected in the canary islands , one collected in taiwan in  <dig> , five sequences from  <dig> collected in spain and germany , one sequence from the 90’s , one from  <dig>  and one from  <dig> collected in the mediterranean . sequences obtained for the p gene of portuguese and galician isolates were also included for animals sc/290/ <dig> , sc/11/ <dig> , sc/31/ <dig> , dd/191/ <dig> , sc/55/ <dig> , sc/51/ <dig> , dd/302/ <dig> , sc/21/ <dig> , sc/221/ <dig> , sc/257/ <dig> , sc/53/ <dig> , and sc/15/ <dig> 



the n gene nucleotide tree  showed a dislocation of sequences between branches. one branch included atlantic samples from  <dig> to  <dig> grouped with the sc/15/ <dig> sequence and with sequences from the mediterranean ; atlantic sequences also from  <dig> to  <dig>  were grouped separately. the remaining pwmv and pmv sequences appeared as two different outgroups.

discussion
in this study we surveyed  <dig> animals and our results indicate a higher prevalence of dmv among stranded striped dolphins  when compared to stranded common dolphins  from the atlantic based populations. similar results had been previously described in the mediterranean during the 1990– <dig> and 2006– <dig> cemv breakouts, when striped dolphins presented higher death and stranding rates than other species  <cit> . several theories have been hypothesized for this higher mortality rate amongst striped dolphins in the mediterranean: they were the most numerous species in the mediterranean and serological studies suggested that, prior to the 2006– <dig> outbreak, antibody levels were low in this population rendering them more susceptible to the cemv infection  <cit> ; also, the fact that they are highly gregarious and tend to live in large pods could contribute to the spread of cemv infection  <cit> ; high polychlorinated biphenyl  levels were also detected in the affected animals, leading to the hypothesis that an impaired immune system might have facilitated the infection by cemv; finally, genetic susceptibility as a result of inbreeding in the mediterranean population  <cit> , which had already been reported as relatively isolated from the atlantic populations  <cit> .

prevalence among striped dolphins from galicia was  <dig>  % while prevalence in striped dolphins stranded in portugal was  <dig>  %. although this difference was not statistically significant, it is important to highlight that prevalence among striped dolphin samples from galicia was probably underestimated since only lung samples were tested. samples from the portuguese coastline allowed testing several organs and antigen was only detected in brain samples of four individuals out of the  <dig> positive striped dolphins. it is therefore possible that the prevalence in striped dolphins from galicia is being strongly underestimated. previous studies from the atlantic based populations were performed in the western part of the atlantic, along the usa coast, and bottlenose dolphins were the most affected cetaceans in that area. in the canary islands a retrospective study was published in  <dig> and  <dig> animals were positive for cemv   <cit> . in this study striped dolphins seem to be the most affected species sampled from the east atlantic.

in four animals it was not possible to amplify viral genomic fragments by conventional rt-pcr. these samples recorded high ct values in the rt-qpcr, corresponding to a low target copy number , which would present a downside using a less sensitive conventional assay. also, three of the four samples were collected in animals from galicia originally stored at −20 °c, which may possibly imply rna degradation hampering the amplification of longer genomic fragments, by conventional rt-pcr.

the genetic distances between samples were low among all sequences included in the phylogenetic trees. nonetheless, pp values were high and consistent in all trees particularly in the dna concatenated tree, adding robustness to the phylogenetic arrangement.

in the phylogenetic trees for the concatenated nucleotides the grouping of viral sequences followed a temporal arrangement, with samples collected since  <dig> forming different clades. when a higher number of sequences was added to the trees  a phylogeographic arrangement becomes clear: all samples from portugal and galicia cluster together , further away from the samples from the mediterranean. the only exception seems to be the sequence from the animal sc/15/ <dig> clustering with samples from the mediterranean, as well as with samples from the canary islands. even samples from animals stranded in the south of portugal , such as sc/11/ <dig>  clustered separately from samples obtained in the mediterranean. this suggests that these populations may be relatively isolated from each other, which is supported by previous findings by other authors  <cit> . it is worth noticing that only one sample from a striped dolphin collected in the canary islands clusters closer to the portuguese and galician samples. all the other samples from the canary islands are closer to mediterranean samples.

positive samples for dmv antigen were detected annually since  <dig> to  <dig>  showing that the virus is circulating in cetacean populations from the atlantic off the coast of portugal and northern spain and both striped dolphins and common dolphins were found to be positive to viral infection. the infection was mapped in the available organs and positive lung samples were detected without association to higher mortality or stranding rates. further studies would be necessary to determine if these animals had an acute, sub-acute or chronic infection and if the dmv infection was the cause of death. animals dd/191/ <dig>  dd/302/ <dig>  sc/21/ <dig>  sc/51/ <dig>  sc/53/ <dig>  sc/11/ <dig> and sc/257/ <dig> stranded alive and were in general emaciated and with high parasite loads, suggesting a sub-acute or chronic systemic infection. histological and immunohistochemical studies should be performed to further characterize the necropsy findings. four animals  were positive only in brain samples, which might imply the development of chronic localized encephalitis after a systemic infection.

the two common dolphins positive for viral antigen  were both alive at the time of stranding and presented high parasite loads and poor body condition. animals dd/302/ <dig> and sc/221/ <dig> are also positive for cetacean gamma herpesvirus  with viral antigen detected systemically. unlike mediterranean populations of striped dolphin  <cit> , morbillivirus infection seems to be endemic in the population of striped dolphins from the atlantic. this correlates to the serological survey conducted in  <dig> in which  <dig>  %  of the analysed cetaceans cross reacted with canine distemper virus antigen in a commercially available elisa kit . to date, the harbour porpoise was reported as the most affected species with morbillivirus infection in the north-eastern atlantic, although infection is probably not endemic considering porpoises’ solitary behaviour  <cit> . large populations are needed to maintain morbillivirus infections as endemic  <cit>  and although striped dolphin abundance has increased over the last years in the portuguese continental coast it is still a rather small population if compared to the common dolphin population . notwithstanding, evidence suggests an endemic situation rather than an epidemic, since no outbreaks have been detected in the striped dolphin population of the atlantic. moreover, positive samples have been detected annually since  <dig>  indicating that this virus is actively circulating in this population reaching prevalence values as high as 24 % in the galician samples. in  <dig>  dolphins stranded along the atlantic coast of spain had low antibody titres for cemv. considering the results obtained in this study, further serological studies are needed to deepen the knowledge about the epidemiology of this disease in striped dolphins.

unlike striped dolphins, the prevalence of stranded common dolphins positive for viral antigen is much lower . the difference in cemv prevalence between stranded common and striped dolphins needs to be fully assessed and further studies are needed to clarify the virus impact on cetacean populations and why do striped dolphins appear to be more susceptible to dmv infection. new approaches should be considered: viral enrichment and random amplification techniques associated with next generation sequencing could contribute to deepen the knowledge on this virus and its interaction with other pathogens.

surveys are a unique tool to provide information on viral epidemiology, especially in free-ranging cetaceans.

CONCLUSIONS
our results suggest that dmv infection is endemic in striped dolphin populations of the eastern atlantic. since it was first reported in cetaceans in the early nineties subtle but consistent changes in the reported viral sequences suggest that the atlantic and the mediterranean populations are relatively isolated from each other, as suggested by other authors. the prevalence of infection in stranded common dolphins is very low when compared to striped dolphins, and our results are in agreement with previous reports that point to a higher susceptibility of striped dolphins to cemv. reasons for differences in susceptibility to this viral infection in different species should be further investigated and serological surveys should also be performed to assess their protection level towards cemv infection.
