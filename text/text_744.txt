BACKGROUND
cell adhesion to an extracellular matrix  is a fundamental feature of multicellular organisms and is a critical component of development, tissue function and homeostasis. adhesive interactions between cells and ecm are complex, requiring the regulation of integrin localization and activity, reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and localized membrane remodeling. after engagement of an ecm substrate, integrin-mediated biochemical signaling induces the actin-driven formation of rac1-dependent lamellipodia and/or cdc42-dependent filipodia  <cit> . a cell spreads as lamellipodia are extended and new adhesive contacts are made with the ecm substrate, stabilizing the cellular protrusions  <cit> .

integrin-mediated cell spreading is accompanied by dramatic alterations to the shape and content of the plasma membrane, particularly at sites where new cell-ecm contacts are formed. these alterations include the extension of the membrane  and the enrichment of integrins and f-actin structures in or near the protrusion. much evidence supports the notion that intracellular membrane trafficking is required for the remodeling of the plasma membrane as well as the redistribution of integrins that occurs during cell spreading. studies have identified roles for the gtpases arf <dig>  <cit> , rab <dig>  <cit> , rab <dig>  <cit> , rab <dig>  <cit> , rab <dig>  <cit>  and dynamin  <cit>  in cell adhesion. these gtpases operate within multi-step membrane trafficking pathways  <cit> , which contribute to the transport of integrins between endosomal compartments as well as to and from the cell surface. the intracellular compartments involved in these trafficking pathways may thus serve as reservoirs of integrins for use in attachment of the extending edge as cells spread.

within the membrane trafficking pathways involved in cell adhesion, how the final stages of the pathways are regulated is not well understood. most known membrane traffic pathways culminate in snare -regulated membrane fusion events. specifically, docking and membrane fusion are regulated by membrane bound snares found on the vesicle  and target  membranes  <cit> . snare-mediated vesicular traffic is potentially involved in several aspects of integrin-mediated adhesion, including control of the intracellular compartmentalization of integrins and remodeling of the plasma membrane at sites of lamellipodium extension. recent studies from our laboratory  <cit>  and others'  <cit>  have implicated the function of snare proteins in cell adhesion and migration. specifically, we have determined that the activity of the endosomal snare cellubrevin/vamp <dig>  is required for normal trafficking of β1integrin to the plasma membrane during adhesion  <cit> , and that a plasma membrane snare, snap <dig> , facilitates spreading of chinese hamster ovary  cells on fibronectin   <cit> . these previous studies have not defined the relationship between the function of cellubrevin/vamp <dig> and that of snap <dig>  nor the role of these snares in plasma membrane remodeling during cell adhesion.

in the present study, we report the first identification of a snare complex, snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig>  that forms in response to cell adhesion to ecm. using ectopic expression of inhibitory snare domains in cho-k <dig> cells, we demonstrate that the functions of vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> are required for the formation of lamellipodia during cell adhesion and migration. we also present the novel finding that the snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex functions in the trafficking of β <dig> integrin from a sorting endosome to a rab11-containing recycling compartment during the delivery of adhesive receptors to the plasma membrane. as well, an interaction between vamp <dig> and snap <dig> was identified that was enhanced specifically during pma-stimulated membrane ruffle formation. inhibition of snap <dig>  vamp <dig> and the golgi snare, gs <dig>  but not vamp <dig> nor syntaxin <dig>  impaired the formation of pma-induced f-actin-rich ruffles. the results suggest that cell adhesion is dependent upon snare function for ecm-induced integrin trafficking and lamellipodium extension, while a distinct snare-dependent pathway leading from the trans-golgi network is required for the formation of pma-induced dorsal membrane ruffles. our findings point to mechanistic differences between lamellipodium extension and membrane ruffle formation that include different snare-regulated pathways.

RESULTS
a snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex is induced in cho cells attached to fibronectin
we have previously reported that the function of snares, including snap <dig>  are required for for endosomal trafficking and normal cell adhesion in cho-k <dig> cells  <cit> . it has also been recently demonstrated that a snare complex comprised of snap25-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> functions in endosomal trafficking in pc <dig> cells  <cit> . we therefore hypothesized that an analogous complex, comprised of snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig>  might function in cells of non-neuronal lineage during cell adhesion. to test this hypothesis, snap <dig> was immunoprecipitated from cho-k <dig> cells held in suspension or plated on fibronectin  and the immunoprecipitate was examined for associated syntaxin <dig>  syntaxin <dig> was more abundant in snap <dig> immunoprecipitate from cells attached to fibrontectin than from suspended cells . to confirm that the snap23-syntaxin <dig> interaction was nsf-sensitive, experiments were conducted using n-ethylmaleimide, an alkylating agent that inactivates nsf. indeed, addition of nem to cells held in suspension increased the amount of syntaxin <dig> found in snap <dig> immunoprecipitate . in contrast to the association of syntaxin <dig> with snap <dig>  no syntaxin <dig> was co-precipitated with the golgi snare gs <dig>  in suspended cells, adherent cells or nem-treated cells . also in contrast to the interaction between snap <dig> and syntaxin <dig> found in adherent cells, was the fact that co-immonoprecipitation of syntaxin <dig> with vamp <dig> was equally efficient in cells plated on fn, held in suspension or those treated with nem . all immunoprecipitation experiments were independently repeated at least three times and the blots were scanned and analyzed by densitometry to quantify the levels of snare-binding partners in immunoprecipitates . normalized to the level of syntaxin <dig> in snap <dig> immunoprecipitates from cells adherent to fn, the relative amount of syntaxin <dig> in snap <dig> immunoprecipitates from cells in suspension was  <dig>  +/-  <dig> % and from cells in suspension treated with nem was  <dig>  +/- <dig> % 

in several cell types, including glial cells  <cit> , platelets  <cit> , and parotid acinar cells  <cit> , vamp <dig> and snap <dig> have been shown to be functional binding partners; thus, we predicted that vamp <dig> may be part of the snap23-syntaxin <dig> complex that is formed during cell adhesion in cho-k <dig> cells. to examine this possibility, sequential immunoprecipitation of syntaxin <dig> followed by vamp <dig> was performed and the presence of snap <dig> analyzed. from cells held in suspension, little or no vamp <dig> co-immunoprecipitated with syntaxin <dig> . this contrasted with the amount of vamp <dig> detected in syntaxin <dig> immunoprecipitate from cells plated on fn . subsequent immunoprecipitation of the primary syntaxin <dig> immunoprecipitate with vamp <dig> antibody revealed the presence of snap <dig> , suggesting that in cho-k <dig> cells a snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex forms, and the detection of this complex is enhanced by cellular adhesion to fibronectin.

to address the possibility that interactions amongst snares were occurring post-lysis, 'lysate-mixing experiments' were performed. cho cells were transfected with flag-snap <dig>  or gfp-syntaxin <dig>  or cotransfected with both these tagged constructs. cotransfected cells were held in suspension or plated on fn for  <dig> min, lysed and the gfp-syntaxin <dig> was immunoprecipitated with anti-gfp antibody. cells transfected with flag-snap <dig> or gfp-syntaxin <dig> alone were held in suspension and lysed. after lysis, the flag-snap23-containing and gfp-syntaxin13-containing lysates were mixed for  <dig> h followed by immunoprecipitation of the gfp-syntaxin <dig> using gfp antibody for  <dig> h. gfp immunoprecipitates were probed for the presence of flag-tagged snap <dig>  flag-snap <dig> only co-precipitated with gfp-syntaxin <dig> in cells cotransfected with gfp-syntaxin <dig> and flag-snap <dig>  not in samples where flag-snap <dig> and gfp-syntaxin <dig> were mixed in vitro . similar to the results seen in fig. 1a, more snap <dig> co-precipitated with syntaxin <dig> from cells adherent to fn than from suspended cells. collectively, these results indicate that vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> specifically form an intracellular, nem-sensitive complex in manner that is partly dependent upon cell adhesion.

vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> are required for lamellipodium extension
to assess the function of vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> in cell spreading, we examined the effect of inhibiting these snares during cell adhesion. snares were inhibited by expressing gfp-tagged, truncated constructs of vamp <dig> , vamp <dig> , syntaxin <dig>  and gs <dig> . these constructs lack transmembrane domains, and are therefore cytosolic proteins that can bind cognate snares through their snare domain, putatively blocking interactions with membrane-anchored endogenous snares and exerting a dominant-negative effect. a gfp-tagged snap <dig> construct with the c-terminal nine amino acids deleted was used  to inhibit snap <dig> function. the mutant snare constructs described here have been used previously to inhibit membrane trafficking in several experimental systems  <cit> . to confirm the functionality of these constructs in the system used here, immunoprecipitates of endogenous cognate snares were probed for both endogenous and ectopically-expressed, truncated snares . the truncated snare constructs were able to interact with endogenous snares suggesting their ability to inhibit cognate binding partners within cells.

lamellipodium extension in cho cells was quantified as the increase in ventral cell area after attachment to fn . similar to previous results using tetanus toxin light chain  to inhibit vamp <dig> function  <cit> , vamp3cyto impaired lamellipodium extension by  <dig> ± 2% compared to untreated controls . inhibiting syntaxin <dig> function by expression of syntaxin13cyto impaired lamellipodium extension by  <dig> ± 3% and expression of the truncated snap23cΔ <dig> impaired lamellipodium extension by  <dig> ± 15% . none of the corresponding wild type  snare proteins affected lamellipodium extension . inhibition of vamp <dig> or gs <dig> had a minimal effect on cellular spreading that was not statistically significant. co-expression of tetanus toxin light chain - which cleaves vamp <dig>  impairs vamp3-mediated traffic  <cit>  and inhibits spreading in cho cells  <cit>  - together with snap23cΔ <dig> or syntaxin13cyto did not result in further inhibition of cell spreading beyond that seen in cells expressing snap23cΔ <dig> or syntaxin13cyto alone , nor did co-expression of syntaxin13cyto with snap23cΔ <dig> . inhibition of vamp <dig> combined with inhibition of syntaxin <dig> did not affect cell spreading more severely than inhibition of syntaxin <dig> alone . similarly, no effect on cell spreading was observed when vamp <dig> and vamp <dig> were inhibited together in the same cells . to confirm the involvement of snap <dig> in spreading, a short hairpin rna  construct designed to knock down expression of snap <dig> in human cells was transfected into hela cells. transfection of hela cells with shrna to snap <dig> inhibited spreading by  <dig> ± 12% . knock down of snap <dig> was confirmed by western blot . these findings suggest that vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig>  but not vamp <dig> or gs <dig>  function in the same membrane trafficking pathway during lamellipodium extension.

to gain insight into the impact of snare inhibition on lamellipodium extension during directed cell migration, haptotactic transwell migration assays were performed. in these assays, cells in serum-free media were placed on top of a membrane with  <dig> μm pores and allowed to migrate through the pores toward fn coated on the underside of the membrane, as well as 10% serum in the lower chamber. similar to the spreading assays, inhibition of gs <dig> and vamp <dig> had little or no effect on migration, while syntaxin13cyto, vamp3cyto and snap23cΔ <dig> inhibited migration by approximately 30%, 20% and 40%, respectively . knock down of snap <dig> in hela cells, using shrna as described above, also inhibited cell migration by approximately 50% .

the observation that blocking vamp <dig>  snap <dig> or syntaxin <dig> function led to an impairment of lamellipodium extension is consistent with two possible explanations. it is possible that cells with impaired snare function: 1) cannot extend lamellipodia efficiently; or 2) can extend lamellipodia, but the lamellipodia cannot form stable adhesive contacts with the substratum and therefore are retracted. to assess these two possibilities, lamellipodium protrusion and retraction were examined in real time from cells plated on fibronection for  <dig> minutes. kymographs of cellular spreading were generated, and the rate and duration of protrusions and retractions were quantified. representative kymographs are shown in fig. 3a and the data is summarized in fig. 3b. in support of a model where snare inhibition impairs lamellipodium protrusion, it was found that cells expressing syntaxin13cyto, vamp3cyto and snap23cΔ <dig> did form lamellipodia, but did so at a significantly slower rate than control cells . lamellipodia from control cells extended at a mean rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min, while syntaxin13cyto and vamp3cyto cells protruded at a mean rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min, respectively. similar to the spreading assay above, snap23cΔ <dig> proved to be the most potent inhibitor of extension, with snap23cΔ <dig> cells protruding at a mean rate of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  μm/min, and vamp4cyto only had a modest effect . snare inhibition also inhibited retraction velocity compared to control cells, though the differences where not as substantial as seen with protrusion velocity .

inhibiting vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> or snap <dig> alters trafficking of β1-integrin
in previous studies, we have demonstrated, using tetx-lc, that vamp <dig> is required for trafficking of β <dig> integrin from the recycling endosome to the plasma membrane and that this inhibition in traffic is a possible explanation for reduced spreading  <cit> . here, we examined whether inhibition with the syntaxin13cyto, vamp3cyto, snap23cΔ <dig>  vamp4cyto and the snap <dig> shrna constructs also prevents exocytosis of β <dig> integrin. integrin exocytosis was monitored by allowing internalized antibody-labeled β <dig> integrin to traffic to the plasma membrane during adhesion to fn. internalization of label was confirmed by permeablization and staining with fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. inhibiting snare function with the snare constructs or shrna did not inhibit endocytosis of labeled integrin relative to controls . in non-transfected control cells, at  <dig> min, β <dig> integrin was visible on the cell surface and became more prominent at  <dig> min . at  <dig> min, the β <dig> integrin signal became more diffuse as the integrin was redistributed on the cell surface as well as internalized again . transfection of cells with empty vector did not alter integrin trafficking . consistent with previous experiments using tetx-lc  <cit> , at  <dig> min vamp3cyto-expressing cells show no labeled β <dig> integrin on their surface . after  <dig> and  <dig> min a modest amount of integrin is visible . in cells expressing syntaxin13cyto, little internalized β <dig> integrin is delivered to the cell surface at  <dig> min , while at  <dig> and  <dig> min time points only a modest amount of integrin has reached the surface . cells expressing snap23cΔ <dig> show little or no labeled integrin on their surface at all time points examined . the surface integrin staining was quantified for the  <dig> min time point of three independent experiments and is shown in fig. 4n. when vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> or snap <dig> were inhibited the exocytosis of labeled integrin was decreased by 60%. similar results were seen when snap <dig> was knocked-down using an shrna construct . by contrast, expression of vamp4cyto slightly increased the appearance of label at the surface .

having shown that vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> form a complex, and that inhibition of these snares impairs integrin exocytosis, we sought to determine where within the cell β <dig> integrin was being trapped. cho cells expressing dominant-negative snare domains were incubated with β <dig> integrin antibody for one hour followed by an acid wash to remove surface antibody. the subcellular localization of the internalized integrin and the endocytic compartment markers rab <dig> and rab <dig> was then assessed . in control, gfp-transfected cells , a portion of the internalized integrin localizes in the cell periphery with the sorting endosome marker rab <dig> . another portion of β <dig> localizes in a concentrated, perinuclear compartment, overlapping with the recycling endosome marker rab <dig> . these distributions were also observed in non-transfected controls . strikingly, in cells expressing vamp3cyto, syntaxin13cyto or snap23cΔ <dig>  the peripheral localization of β <dig> was unaltered, but there was little or no perinuclear β1- or rab11-containing compartment . in cells expressing the dominant-negative snare inhibitors, the concentrated, central compartment containing rab <dig> appeared to be disrupted, becoming punctate and peripherally distributed . it is important to note, however, that the association of integrin with rab <dig> was maintained, though the morphology and location of this compartment was dramatically altered. further analysis revealed that expression of the mutant snares had caused rab <dig> to redistribute and extensively co-localize with the rab <dig> compartment . the inhibition of this pathway does not appear to be specific to integrin trafficking as the vamp3cyto, syntaxin13cyto and snap23cΔ <dig> also inhibit transferrin trafficking into a perinuclear compartment . expression of vamp4cyto  and gs15cyto  had no effect on β <dig> integrin or transferrin  trafficking into the perinuclear compartment. neither vamp4cyto nor gs15cyto altered the morphology of the recycling endosome to the degree that vamp3cyto, syntaxin13cyto or snap23cΔ <dig> did .

to further assess the role of snap <dig> in trafficking of β <dig> integrin, we monitored trafficking of the integrin in hela cells expressing shrna to reduce expression of snap <dig> . hela cells transfected with control plok- <dig> vector had similar intracellular distributions of β <dig> and rab <dig> to those described above, with a population of these markers co-localizing in a concentrated, perinuclear compartment . consistent with cells expressing snap23cΔ <dig>  hela cells transfected with snap <dig> shrna showed little or no perinuclear β1- or rab11-containing compartment . taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> or snap <dig> disrupts trafficking from the sorting endosome to the recycling endosome, resulting in perturbed recycling of integrin β <dig> 

snap <dig> and vamp <dig> function are required for pma-induced membrane ruffling
the observation that blocking vamp <dig>  snap <dig> or syntaxin <dig> function inhibits integrin trafficking suggested that snare-mediated trafficking supports lamellipodium extension by providing ecm receptors at the leading edge to aid in attachment and stabilization of lamellipodia. previous studies, however, have shown that when membrane trafficking is inhibited integrin-mediated cell attachment is not altered  <cit> , and measurements herein suggest that lamellipodium protrusion was inhibited rather than attachment . these results are consistent with the notion that snare function is required for the formation of actin-based membrane protrusions. to determine if inhibition of snare-mediated traffic perturbs actin-based membrane remodeling independently of cell attachment, we tested the ability of cho-k <dig> cells to form f-actin containing ruffles in response to pma. this was used as an indicator of the cells' capacity to form membrane protrusions without any requirement for the protrusions to attach to the underlying substratum.

in cho cells, endogenous snap <dig> was detected in pma-induced membrane ruffles . while this observation is consistent with a role for snap <dig> in ruffle formation, we sought to directly assess the function of snap <dig>  and snares with which it interacts, in the formation of ruffles. to quantify membrane ruffles, we have developed a novel and rigorous method to automatically define and measure f-actin-rich ruffle structures in confocal micrographs  <cit> . cho cells were transfected with the inhibitory snare constructs described above and f-actin-based ruffle formation was quantified. as seen in fig. 7g, expression of snap23cΔ <dig> substantially reduced ruffle formation - the ruffle index for gfp-expressing/pma-treated cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and that for snap23cΔ9-expressing/pma-treated cells was  <dig>  ±  <dig> , a 67% decrease . confirming the effect of snap <dig> inhibition on membrane ruffling, we observed that shrna mediated knock-down of snap <dig> expression reduced ruffle formation in hela cells . hela cells were used for these experiments due to their compatibility with our human sequence-specific shrna construct.

inhibition of vamp <dig> or syntaxin <dig> did not significantly alter pma-induced membrane ruffle formation . results from transfection of either vamp3cyto  or tetx light chain , equally indicated a lack of effect on membrane ruffling. inhibition of syntaxin <dig> caused an observable reduction in ruffle formation but this was not statistically significant compared to gfp-transfected/pma-treated control . in contrast with their effect on cell spreading, inhibition of vamp <dig> and gs <dig> caused a 50% reduction in the formation of pma-induced ruffles . since gs <dig>  <cit>  and vamp <dig>  <cit>  function in the biosynthetic-secretory membrane trafficking pathway, brefeldin a and a dominant-negative arf <dig> mutant , known inhibitors of the biosynthetic-secretory pathway  <cit> , where used to confirm the involvement of this membrane trafficking pathway in pma-induced ruffling. brefeldin a and arf1-t31a reduced ruffles by 45% and 75%, respectively .

the observation that vamp4cyto, snap23cΔ <dig> inhibited membrane ruffling suggested that these snares may function in the same ruffling-dependent trafficking pathway. therefore, we examined whether pma could induce the formation of a vamp4-snap <dig> complex in serum starved cho cells. stimulation with pma increased the amount of snap <dig> that immunoprecipitated with vamp <dig> , while having no effect on the amount of snap <dig> that co-precipitated with vamp <dig> . as in fig.  <dig>  the amounts of snare-binding partners in the immunoprecipitates were quantified from at least three independent experiments by densitometric analysis of western blots . normalized to the level of snap <dig> in vamp <dig> immunoprecipitates from non-induced control cells, the relative amount of snap <dig> invamp <dig> immunoprecipitates from cells induced with pma was  <dig>  +/-  <dig> %. normalized to the level of snap <dig> in vamp <dig> immunoprecipitates from non-induced control cells, the relative amount of snap <dig> invamp <dig> immunoprecipitates from cells induced with pma was  <dig> +/-  <dig> %. the results suggest that pma specifically induces a snap23-vamp <dig> complex during the formation of membrane ruffles.

discussion
in the present study, we have shown that vamp <dig>  syntaxin <dig> and snap <dig> form a complex during cho cell adhesion to fn. while previous studies have documented the existence of a vamp3-snap23-containing snare complex  <cit> , herein is the first evidence that formation of such a complex can be stimulated by cell-ecm interaction. the data are also the first to implicate the function of the endosomal snare syntaxin <dig> in cell adhesion and migration. inhibition of syntaxin <dig> impaired cell spreading and migration to an extent that was quantitatively similar to the impairment caused by inhibition of vamp <dig> and the effects of inhibiting vamp <dig> and syntaxin <dig> during cell spreading were not additive, suggesting that these snares function along the same trafficking pathway. this conclusion is consistent with our detection of snap <dig> in association with vamp <dig> that had been immunoprecipitated from syntaxin <dig> immunoprecipitate . sequential immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins is not an efficient process, often providing poor protein recovery, and detection of these interactions here, in response to cell-ecm interaction, is an important observation. furthermore, evidence of the vamp3-syntaxin13-snap <dig> complex was obtained through analysis of both endogenous proteins  and ectopically expressed constructs , and in both cases the snare interactions were enhanced by cell adhesion to ecm substrate.

the cellular importance of the snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex is revealed by data showing that cell spreading and β <dig> integrin exocytosis were impaired when the function of these snares was disrupted. our findings are consistent with much evidence indicating that cellular adhesion requires regulated membrane traffic, including the recycling of integrins and the redistribution of integrins to sites of lamellipodium protrusion  <cit> . recent studies directly implicate vamp <dig> in trafficking of integrins during cho cell adhesion  <cit>  and snap <dig> in focal adhesion formation  <cit> . in the present study, we now report that inhibiting snap <dig> reduced cell spreading by approximately 75%, whether vamp <dig> was inhibited or not, consistent with a model in which the functions of these two snares during cell adhesion are part of a common pathway. overall, these results argue that the snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> interaction is functionally important to this cell-ecm interaction.

our findings do not exclude the possibility of other snares being involved in the formation of lamellipodia, but they do suggest that snap <dig> function may be central in this process. it is possible that snap <dig> functions at the plasma membrane and at internal endosomes to facilitate the delivery of secreted and/or recycled components during lamellipodium extension. other snares  may function in compartment-specific pathways, but all these pathways may, in turn, depend on snap <dig> function. if so, then snap23cΔ <dig> would be expected to be a more potent inhibitor of cell motility than other soluble snare domains, as was observed. in support of this model, others have reported that a vamp2-syntaxin13-snap <dig> complex mediates traffic from a sorting endosome to a recycling endosome in neurons  <cit> . in non-neuronal cells, a similar complex, such as the vamp3-syntaxin13-snap <dig> complex described here, may be involved in an analogous trafficking pathway. our findings confirm that blocking syntaxin <dig>  vamp <dig> or snap <dig> function interrupts β <dig> integrin and transferrin trafficking to a perinuclear recycling compartment, causing extensive colocalization with rab <dig> . these results are the first demonstration of a snare complex that functions in transport from a sorting endosome to a recycling endosome in non-neuronal cells.

the effects of snare inhibition on cell spreading and migration suggest that snare function is required to support the localized extension of the plasma membrane to form lamellipodia. it is interesting to note that, compared to the effects on lamellipodium extension , relatively modest effects were observed in cell migration . this may be explained by the fact that the cells do retain some capacity to form protrusions, albeit at a reduced rate , and this impaired protrusive capacity supports some degree of cell migration while having a more negative impact on cell spreading. the results of live cell imaging, presented in fig. 3b, reveal that when the function of syntaxin <dig>  vamp <dig> or snap <dig> is disrupted lamellipodia do form, but the protrusion velocity is significantly reduced. it has been demonstrated that protrusion velocity is dependent on dynamic actin polymerization at the edge of lamellipodia, independent of integrin function  <cit> . here, we present evidence that pma-induced f-actin dependent membrane ruffle formation was impaired by blocking snap <dig>  since membrane ruffle formation is not dependent on the attachment of membrane protrusions to a substratum, these results lead to the conclusion that the function of snap <dig> is required for the remodeling of the plasma membrane that is the basis for lamellipodium formation. in this context, snare-mediated traffic may be necessary for the insertion of membrane, from intracellular compartments, into the plasma membrane, or the trafficking of actin regulating proteins to the leading edge. it is also possible that other plasma membrane snares  are involved in remodeling the plasma membrane. for example, syntaxin <dig> has been shown to be involved in cell membrane expansion  <cit> . the cells studied here do express syntaxin <dig> and we are currently developing assays to examine the function syntaxin <dig> and other snares in cell membrane remodelling events.

the fact that inhibition of vamp <dig> or gs <dig> impaired membrane ruffle formation is consistent with a previous study that suggested pma-induced ruffle formation is dependent on arf <dig> activity  <cit> . arf <dig> is a well known regulator of the biosynthetic-secretory pathway and has also been ascribed important signaling functions leading to actin remodeling  <cit> . given the results presented here, it is likely that vamp <dig> and gs <dig> function in the secretory pathway along with arf <dig>  gs <dig> localizes to the golgi, and gs <dig> function has been linked to retrograde traffic within the golgi and trans-golgi network  <cit> . vamp <dig> is known to mediate retrograde traffic from endosomes and secretroy granules to the tgn  <cit> , and has been implicated in glut <dig> anterograde traffic from the golgi  <cit> . vamp <dig> may also be directly involved in trafficking to the plasma membrane as a minor amount of vamp <dig> is found at the plasma membrane . in the present study, our observations indicate that the functions of vamp <dig> and gs <dig> are required for membrane ruffle formation in response to pma, but the activity of these snares is not necessary for ecm-stimulated lamellipodium extension. conversely, the functions of vamp <dig> and syntaxin <dig> are required for the efficient formation of lamellipodia during cell spreading on ecm, but not pma-induced membrane ruffling. therefore, these data indicate that snare-mediated membrane traffic is important for both lamellipodium extension and membrane ruffle formation, but that the snare-mediated pathways involved in these two processes are not identical.

CONCLUSIONS
the results described here are the first to directly demonstrate that formation of a snap23-syntaxin13-vamp <dig> complex is modulated during cell-ecm adhesion. the observations contribute to a growing body of evidence describing an important role for snare-mediated membrane traffic in cell adhesion. importantly, the present findings advance our understanding of the role of snare-mediated membrane traffic in cell adhesion; it supports transport from a sorting endosome to a recycling compartment during the delivery of adhesive receptors to the plasma membrane. furthermore, blocking the function of snap <dig> impaired the formation of membrane ruffles in response to pma, a process that is expected to be independent of adhesive receptor localization. thus, snare-mediated traffic may be needed to deliver membrane components that allow the plasma membrane to be remodeled during the elaboration of membrane ruffles, as well as lamellipodia. the fact that different snares are required for the formation of ruffles and lamellipodia suggests that these processes have partially separate molecular mechanisms. we have now identified a snare complex that is induced in cells in response to ecm attachment and that is essential for normal cell adhesion. future work to elucidate how snare complex formation is regulated during cell adhesion will further advance the understanding of cell-ecm interactions.
