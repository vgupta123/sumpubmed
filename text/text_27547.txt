BACKGROUND
inactivation of the dnd <dig> gene results in sterility in vertebrates as well as causes development of testicular germ cell tumors in mice  <cit> . dnd <dig> function is essential to maintain viable germ cells in vertebrates  <cit> . mice with inactivated dnd <dig> show progressive reduction in germ cell numbers starting around embryonic day   <dig> and are therefore rendered sterile at birth. in addition, when inactivation of dnd <dig> occurs in  <dig> strain mouse background, these mice have a very high incidence of testicular germ cell tumors  <cit> . thus, on the  <dig> background, some germ cells escape death to undergo cancerous transformation. the transformed germ cells eventually differentiate randomly into myriad cell types that constitute the teratomas or teratocarcinomas in the testes. the testicular germ cell tumors in mice resemble human pediatric testicular type i germ cell tumors  <cit> .

dnd <dig> has canonical rna recognition motifs   <cit> . mutations engineered in the rrm prevent interaction of dnd <dig> with mrnas and have also been reported to prevent nucleo-cytoplasmic translocation of zebrafish dnd <dig>  <cit> . in addition, a disease associated nucleotide polymorphism in the highly conserved rrm of dnd <dig> was detected in a human patient with germ cell tumor  <cit> . previous reports have shown that dnd <dig> interacts with the 3'-untranslated region  of mrnas such as that of the cell cycle inhibitor, p <dig>  and cell cycle regulator and tumor suppressor, lats <dig>   <cit> . dnd <dig> interacts with u-rich sequences found in the 3'-utr of p <dig>  in the case of p <dig>  interaction of dnd <dig> hindered mir- <dig> access to p <dig> 3'-utr. this led to increased expression levels of p <dig>  although dnd <dig> inhibits mir- <dig> and  <dig> from lats <dig> mrna, the dnd1-binding sequences on the 3'-utr of lats <dig> have not been identified. dnd <dig> was also shown to interact with the u-rich sequences on zebrafish nanos <dig> and tdrd <dig> mrnas.

the exact mechanism as to how dnd <dig> prevents mirna-mediated translation repression is unclear. in the case of p <dig>  nanos <dig> and tdrd <dig>  the u-rich sequences are found adjacent to mirna binding sites  <cit> . this suggests that dnd <dig> may bind to mrna to physically displace the mirnas and mirisc . an alternate possibility is that dnd <dig> may bind mrna and sequester it away from mirna access.

in the mouse, dnd <dig> is detected in the early embryo  <cit>  and then becomes enriched in primordial germ cells  after ~ e <dig>  <cit> . we also detected dnd <dig> expression in mouse   <cit>  and human embryonic stem cells . pgcs and es cells share gene expression patterns, markers and mirnas in common  <cit> . for example, both pgcs and es cells express cellular markers such as oct <dig>  vasa, nanog and fragilis. they express similar mirna families such as mir 209- <dig>  mir 302- <dig> and mir 17- <dig>  <cit>  and express critical pluripotency factors such as oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog  <cit> . indeed, there is speculation that es cells may be derived from germ cells of the early embryo  <cit> . because es cells express dnd <dig>  it is expected that they also normally express the mrnas and mirnas whose activity is modulated by dnd <dig>  moreover, es cells are easily cultured in vitro and are more experimentally amenable compared to germ cells. therefore, es cells should serve as a good system to study dnd <dig> function. we therefore sought to determine the mrna targets of dnd <dig> in hes cells. we expect that there are shared sets of mrna targets in pgcs and es cells and knowledge of the nature of the transcripts that associate with dnd <dig> will illuminate the function of dnd <dig> in pluripotent cell types such as in es and germ cells.

methods
generation of stable hes/ha-dnd <dig> cell lines
the hes cell lines h <dig>  and h <dig>    <cit>  were cultured on mitotically inactivated mouse embryonic fibroblasts or under feeder free conditions on matrigel . h <dig>  hes lines were genetically modified to stably express ha-tagged human dnd <dig> in an inducible manner. two recombinant lentiviral constructs were introduced into h <dig> cells. introduction of the first lentivirus, which expresses transactivator  from a constitutive ubiquitin promoter , generated h9-rtta cells  <cit> . the second virus encodes the inducible target locus  downstream of the doxycycline-responsive promoter   <cit> , and bears an ires-gfp reporter . the cell line  containing both viruses was derived by two rounds of transient and low dose doxycycline induction , followed by flow cytometry for gfp+ cells.

thus, the derived hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells use the tetracycline on  system, in which treatment of cells with doxycycline  causes dox-activated transactivator to interact with the sgtre element to turn on expression of ha-dnd <dig> 

facs analysis
dual labeling using anti-ssea- <dig> and anti-oct <dig> antibodies was performed on hes/ha-dnd <dig> cell lines to determine the percent of undifferentiated cells in the population. hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells ranged from 50% to 77% positive  for the markers oct <dig> and ssea- <dig>  these hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells were subsequently passaged and treated with dox prior to performing rip experiments.

induction of ha-dnd <dig> with increasing concentrations of doxycycline
hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells, grown on matrigel in 6-well plates, were treated with increasing concentrations,  <dig> -  <dig> ng/ml, of doxycycline  for  <dig> h. the cells were lysed and used for immunoblotting.

immunoblotting with rabbit anti-dnd <dig> antibody, anti-ha antibody and anti-gapdh was performed as described  <cit> . densitometric analysis was performed to quantitate the band intensities.

ribonucleoprotein immunoprecipitation  assay
rip was performed essentially as described in  <cit> .  <dig> independent rip experiments followed by rt-pcr were performed and one representative result is shown . hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells, grown on matrigel, were treated with dox  for  <dig> h. control es cells were untreated. the cells were subsequently lysed and cell extracts were made with mild lysis buffers to minimize exchange of mrnas between proteins. the lysates  were incubated with anti-ha antibody  linked to agarose beads. excess trna  was included to block spurious interaction of rnas with ha-dnd <dig>  as another control, we incubated mrnp extracts from dox treated cells with anti-flag antibody linked to beads . the anti-flag antibody used was the same igg <dig> isotype as the anti-ha antibody.

the beads  were pelleted by centrifugation, extensively washed, treated with proteinase k and the rna was eluted off. the extracted rna was used to prepare cdna. rna concentrations were measured using nanodrop spectrophotometer  and equivalent amounts were used to prepare cdna. the 'high capacity rna-to-cdna master mix with no rt control' kit  was used for cdna preparation. cdna was also prepared from the other fractions: mrnp lysates, input and supernatant  . aliquots from these fractions were saved during the rip procedure.

pcr was performed to analyze the rip, i and s fractions for transcripts encoding p <dig>  hprt, etc. the primers for rt-pcr were as follows  <cit> : p27-f ttaaaaatacatatcgctgacttc, p27-r cttcataccccgctccac, oct4-f gacaacaatgaaaatcttcaggaga, oct4-r ctggcgccggttacagaacca, sox2-f cccccctgtggttacctcttc, sox2-r ttctcccccctccagttcg, lats2-f gcgacctctgggatgatgtg, lats2-r ttggagtccccaccagtgaa, nanog-f atgcctgtgatttgtgggcc, nanog-r gccagttgtttttctgccac, myc-f cccgcgacgatgcccctcaac, myc-r agaagccgctccacatacagtcct, lin28-f acgtgcgcatggggttcg, lin28-r tgggccttcagcggacat, klf4-f aggtggcgggctgatgggcaagtt, klf4-r gaagcggcagggcagggtgacagt, tp53-f ccccctcctggcccctgtcatctt, tp53-r ccgggcgggggtgtggaatcaac, bclx-f catggcagcagtaaagcaag, bclx-r gcattgttcccatagagttcc, bax-f ggcccaccagctctgagcagatc; bax-r gacaacccggccccagttgaagtt, hprt-f gttgagagatcatctccacc, hprt-r agctatgatgaaccaggtta.

the pcr cycle for each transcript was adjusted depending on the nature of the primer and abundance of the transcript, as determined in preliminary experiments . pcr cycles for each transcript was as follows: p <dig> , hprt <dig> , oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog , lin <dig>  klf <dig>  myc, tp <dig>  lats <dig>  bax and bclx . the expected sizes of the rt-pcr products are:  <dig> bp for oct <dig>   <dig> bp for sox <dig>   <dig> bp for nanog,  <dig> bp for lin <dig>   <dig> bp for myc,  <dig> bp for klf <dig>   <dig> bp for lats <dig>   <dig> bp for tp <dig>   <dig> bp xl product from bclx and  <dig> bp for bax.

dnd <dig> interacting sequences
we examined full-length transcripts for the known human p <dig> dnd <dig> interacting sequence  <cit>  tttttccttattt or tttttacctttt; nos <dig> dnd <dig> interacting sequence tgtttgatttt or ttttatttt and tdrd <dig> dnd <dig> interacting sequence ttgatttt. in cases where multiple transcripts are present, all known transcripts were examined for the presence of any of the known dnd <dig> interacting sequences.

RESULTS
dnd <dig> expression in human es cells
we previously detected dnd <dig> expression in g <dig> mouse es cells  <cit> . using immunoblotting and rt-pcr techniques, we were also able to detect dnd <dig> expression in human embryonic stem cells , h <dig>  and h <dig>  . however, dnd <dig> is not detected in mouse embryo fibroblast  cells, the feeder cells on which the hes cells grow. in the case of mefs, bands are observed in both superscript  and superscript  lanes . these likely are non-specific bands and indicate no specific dnd <dig> expression in mefs, as was also previously shown  <cit> .

doxycycline-inducible expression of ha-dnd <dig> in hes cells
we established lentiviral modified hes lines that express ha-tagged human dnd <dig>  in an inducible manner. the hes/ha-dnd <dig> cell line uses the tetracycline on  system in which doxycycline turns on the expression of ha-dnd <dig>  <cit>  . the hes/ha-dnd <dig> cell line showed a modest dose-dependent increase of ha-dnd <dig> levels  upon treatment with increasing concentrations of dox for  <dig> h . we also determined the levels of endogenous dnd <dig> expression using anti-dnd <dig> antibody . the level of endogenous dnd <dig> in hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells treated with increasing dox was fairly similar . comparing the levels of induced ha-dnd <dig> to endogenous dnd <dig> , we estimate that ha-dnd <dig> levels range from about a  <dig> to 6-fold increase compared to endogenous dnd <dig>  for subsequent rip experiments, we treated hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells with  <dig> ng/ml dox for  <dig> h which induces a  <dig> -fold higher level of ha-dnd <dig> compared to endogenous dnd <dig> levels.

ha-dnd <dig> associated p <dig> mrna
first, we performed rip  <cit>  to test whether ha-tagged dnd <dig>  induced to be expressed in the hes/ha-dnd <dig> cell line, can pull down p <dig> mrna. this is because it has been previously shown that dnd <dig> binds to the 3'-utr of p <dig> mrna  <cit> .

hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells were treated with dox  whereas control cells were untreated. the cells were subsequently lysed to make the cell extracts that were used to perform rip as described in methods  <cit>  and outlined in figure  <dig> 

we used rt-pcr to analyze the rip, i and s fractions for p <dig>  cdna was made using equal amounts  of rna from each fraction . equivalent amounts of cdna were then used for rt-pcr. our results showed that p <dig> levels were barely detectable in the input fraction  but enriched in the rip fraction . this indicates that p <dig> mrna is indeed pulled down specifically with ha-dnd <dig> in the rip fraction . although p <dig> is barely detectable in the input lanes in figure 2c, p <dig> is normally present in the hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells as it can be detected in both untreated and dox-treated cells using higher pcr cycles .

in contrast, rt-pcr for hprt indicated that it is present in all the fractions in dox treated and untreated cells. this rules out specific interaction of hprt mrna with ha-dnd <dig> 

in addition, we monitored for the presence of ha-dnd <dig> in the different fractions. immunoblotting using anti-dnd <dig> show that the ha-dnd <dig> was present in the dox treated es cells and in the input  fraction, but not in the supernatant  fraction . this indicates that the majority of induced ha-dnd <dig> in the input  fraction was efficiently immunoprecipitated by anti-ha antibody and pelleted in the rip fraction. because of proteinase k digestion prior to rna elution, immunoblotting could not be performed on the rip fraction.

pluripotency factors, tumor suppressors and apoptotic factors are dnd <dig> targets
next, we examined whether transcripts of pluripotency factors associate with dnd <dig>  this is because dnd <dig> is normally expressed in both es cells and primordial germ cells  and both of these cell types express pluripotency factors. thus, we hypothesized that transcripts encoding pluripotency factors may be targets of dnd <dig> in es cells. therefore, we performed rt-pcr on rip fractions to test for pull-down of mrnas of candidate pluripotency factors such as oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, lin <dig>  klf <dig> and cmyc. we also examined whether the mrna transcripts of cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressors  and apoptotic factors  are targets of dnd <dig> 

the results from rip-rt experiments showed that the following pluripotency factors are specific targets of dnd1: oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog and lin <dig> . in the case of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog  we observe specific pull down of the transcripts in lane  <dig>  compared to lane  <dig> . in addition we observed enrichment of transcript compared to that in the input  lane . in contrast, similar comparison of the transcript levels in the test and control lanes with the input lanes , lead us to conclude that klf <dig> and c myc are not specific targets of dnd <dig>  we note that faint bands are observed in the control rip lanes . these bands indicate that anti-ha antibody  and anti-flag antibody  can also pull down low levels of transcripts, which represent non-specific interactions. in comparison, specific pull-down of transcripts occurs at higher levels .

tp <dig> and lats <dig> are also specifically pulled down in the rip fraction of dox-treated cells . however, in the case of tp <dig> and lats <dig>  there was not significant enrichment in the rip fraction  compared to the input  lane . this indicates that lin <dig> is more efficiently pulled down with dnd <dig> compared to tp <dig> and lats <dig> 

on the other hand, transcripts of both the pro-apoptotic factor bax and the anti-apoptotic factor bclx are very efficiently pulled down with dnd <dig> . there is also significant enrichment of bax and bclx transcripts in the rip fraction of dox treated cells .

dnd <dig> binding sequences in the 3'-utrs of mrna transcripts
next, we examined whether the transcripts studied contains the known dnd <dig> binding sequences. we therefore examined the full-length transcripts for u-rich dnd <dig> interacting sequences that were previously mapped in the 3'-utr of p <dig>  <cit>  as well as for sequences that were mapped to the 3'-utr of nanos <dig> and tdrd <dig>  in cases where multiple transcripts of a gene are known, all the transcripts were examined for the presence of any of the dnd <dig> interacting sequence. we found that none of the transcripts that we examined in this study contained the same dnd <dig> interacting sequence as p <dig>  however, the 3'-utrs of oct <dig>  nanog, myc and lin <dig> harbored sequences similar to the dnd <dig> interacting sequences found in tdrd <dig>  lats <dig> 3'-utrs contained the dnd <dig> interacting sequences similar to that found in nanos <dig> .

 <dig> as experimentally determined and shown in figure  <dig> and  <dig> 

thus, sequence examination of transcripts alone does not predict whether a particular transcript will bind to and be pulled-down with dnd <dig>  although myc did not bind to ha-dnd <dig>  the 3'-utr of one of its transcripts contains putative dnd <dig> binding sequences. in contrast, even though bax and bclx bound very efficiently to dnd <dig> ribonucleoprotein complex, we did not find dnd <dig> binding sites in any of its transcripts. this suggests that there likely exists additional dnd <dig> binding sequences that are yet to be defined. to test this, we aligned the 3'-utrs of the dnd <dig> interacting mrnas to examine for any common sequences. we found some regions with weak consensus that may represent novel dnd <dig> binding sites. further experimental analysis will be required to establish whether these are indeed dnd <dig> binding sites.

the other possibility is that interaction of mrnas with dnd <dig> may be mediated through co-interaction of dnd <dig> with other proteins and thus presence of dnd <dig> binding sequences within mrnas may not be essential for interaction.

discussion
we demonstrate use of a stable, inducible es cell line to identify transcripts that associate with dnd <dig>  our results show that transcripts of pluripotency factors associate with dnd <dig>  oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog are key transcription factors essential for maintenance of the pluripotent state of es cells  <cit>  and are also important for early germ cells  <cit> . these results lead us to hypothesize that dnd <dig> likely imposes another level of regulation of expression of pluripotency factors. however, it remains to be determined how dnd <dig> association with these transcripts affect es cell properties.

mirnas target multiple mrnas simultaneously. on the other hand, dnd <dig> is also able to inhibit mirna activity from multiple mrnas  <cit> . our results also hint at the broad range of mrna targets of dnd <dig>  further studies are needed to elucidate the role of dnd <dig> in modulating specific mirna activity from each mrna.

our rip-rt results show that the transcripts of the cell cycle regulators, tp <dig> and lats <dig> mrna are also targets of dnd <dig>  this observation is corroborated by a recent study where rip technique was applied to nih3t <dig> cells and showed that tagged dnd <dig> is able to pull down a number of cell cycle regulators including lats <dig> and p <dig>  <cit> .

in addition, mrna transcripts of both the pro-apoptotic factor bax and the anti-apoptotic factor mrna, bclx, are efficiently pulled down with dnd <dig>  thus dnd <dig> interacts with a broad variety of targets and with mrnas that have opposite effects, as for example, dnd <dig> associates with mrnas of both anti- and pro-apoptotic factor, bclx and bax, respectively. this raises the question as to what confers specificity for dnd <dig> function? one possibility is that there exist factors that favor interaction with specific mrnas at particular stages of the cell cycle or under certain physiological conditions. it is also likely that intrinsic and cellular factors may regulate dnd <dig> function to promote cell survival and maintain a pluripotent cell state. depending on the physiological state of the cell, the balance of expression of the opposing factors likely determine cell fate, death or transformation.

germ cells, testicular cancer cells and es cells share gene expression patterns  <cit> . for example, sox <dig>  nanog and lin <dig> expression can be used to distinguish different histological subtypes of human testicular cancers  <cit> . this is thought to reflect the origin of testicular cancer from germ cells. whether the same pluripotency factors also associate with dnd <dig> in germ cells will have to be experimentally determined. interestingly, our observation that dnd <dig> interacts with pluripotency and anti-apoptotic factor mrnas may explain why lack of dnd <dig> results in the death of germ cells in mice. pluripotency factors are able to reprogram differentiated adult cell types into ips  cells. for example, human ips cells require oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, and lin <dig> whereas mouse ips cells require oct <dig>  sox <dig>  myc and klf <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, we found that transcripts encoding oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog and lin <dig> but not klf <dig> associate with dnd <dig> in hes cells.

surprisingly, we found that dnd <dig> interacting sequence similar to p <dig> are rarely present in other transcripts. however, the 3'-utr of some transcripts harboured dnd <dig> interacting sequences described in nanos <dig> and tdrd <dig>  therefore, at present, based on sequence analysis alone, it is difficult to predict whether a particular transcript interacts with dnd <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report the generation of the inducible hes cell system  and demonstrate the advantage of using this stable, dox inducible hes cell system to identify the rna targets of dnd <dig>  hes cells closely resemble primordial germ cells and we can induce and control expression of modest levels of ha-tagged dnd <dig>  using the hes/ha-dnd <dig> cells, we demonstrate that transcripts of pluripotency factors, cell cycle regulators and apoptotic factors are associated with dnd <dig> and are likely targets of regulation by dnd <dig>  we found that rip followed by rt-pcr allows us to quickly and readily discriminate between specific and non-specific mrna targets of dnd <dig>  further techniques such as microarray or rna-seq following rip will be useful to identify the global targets of dnd <dig> from es cells. although a number of transcripts associate with dnd <dig>  surprisingly, dnd <dig> interacting sequence similar to p <dig> are rarely present in other transcripts. thus additional dnd <dig> interacting sequences remain to be identified.

our result suggests that dnd <dig> imposes another level of translational regulation that may modulate expression of critical factors in es cells. because dnd <dig> is implicated in reciprocally regulating mirna mediated translation suppression of specific target mrnas, this suggests that the balance between dnd <dig> and mirnas modulates context-dependent mrna targets.
