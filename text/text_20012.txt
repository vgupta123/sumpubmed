BACKGROUND
trichomes are epidermal hairs that serve as a physical barrier on plant surfaces against insect pests, while maintaining a moist microclimate around young seedlings. defence against insect pests depends on trichome density, distribution pattern, length, shape, number of branches, and on whether they are glandular or non-glandular. non-glandular trichome development has been studied extensively in arabidopsis  a close relative of b. napus  <cit> . a minimum of  <dig> genome blocks are conserved, but replicated and rearranged in the present day b. napus genome compared with the arabidopsis genome  <cit> , such that an estimated two to six homologues per gene are expected in b. napus  <cit> . many differences exist between these two long-diverged genera, one being that the brassicas have unbranched trichomes  whereas arabidopsis trichomes are mostly tri-branched  <cit> .

a range of mutants defining specific aspects of trichome development have been recovered from arabidopsis  <cit> , and > <dig> agi models are commonly known  or have been listed in the arabidopsis information resource . transparent testa glabra <dig>   <cit> , glabra <dig>   <cit> , enhancer of glabra <dig>   <cit> , glabrous <dig>   <cit> , and to some extent myb <dig>  <cit> , are genes specifying proteins involved in arabidopsis trichome initiation. gl <dig> is moderately expressed in epidermal cells of young leaves prior to trichome initiation but is highly expressed in initiating trichome cells, becoming less detectable or non-existent in mature trichomes  <cit> . gl <dig>  functions with gl <dig>  and ttg <dig>  to form a mbw activator complex. over-expression of a 35s:gl <dig> cdna in wild type arabidopsis results in an increased trichome number phenotype  <cit> , while over-expression of gl <dig> and gl <dig> together stimulated a “super-dense” leaf trichome phenotype , with a few trichomes additionally present on cotyledons and hypocotyls  <cit> . the pleiotropic ttg <dig> locus regulates trichome initiation, as well as flavonoid production, seed coat mucilage production, and root hair development pathways in arabidopsis  <cit>  and its transcripts are present to some extent in almost all organs of wild type arabidopsis  <cit> . arabidopsis ttg <dig> mutants are not able to initiate trichomes  <cit> ; however, clusters of rudimentary trichomes are formed along the leaf margin in weak ttg <dig> mutants suggesting an additional contrasting role in trichome repression for ttg <dig> that has yet to be explored  <cit> . mutations in leafy cotyledon <dig>  result in trichomes on the adaxial surface of the cotyledons, where trichomes are not normally produced  <cit> .

the wrky transcription factor, ttg <dig>  initially acts downstream of ttg <dig>  gl <dig>  and gl <dig>  and contributes with other proteins  in trichome initiation  <cit> . later in trichome development, ttg <dig> and gl <dig> regulate lateral out-growth, morphological development, and maturation of trichomes  <cit> . gl <dig> is normally expressed in developing trichomes and surrounding epidermal cells of leaf primordia, but is also detected in the petiole and mid-vein of developing leaves. increased trichome size correlates with increased gl <dig> activity, which remains high in mature trichomes for the life time of the cell  <cit> . in both arabidopsis gl <dig> and ttg <dig> single mutants, gl <dig> expression is undetectable in epidermal cells of fully expanded mature leaves, suggesting that gl <dig> expression is regulated by both gl <dig> and ttg <dig>  <cit> .

in the activator-inhibitor model of arabidopsis trichome initiation, the mbw tri-protein complex or di-protein gl1-gl3/egl <dig> complexes not only promote gl <dig> expression to activate trichome formation  <cit> , but also initiate transcription of inhibitor genes. all seven of the single-repeat r3myb myb inhibitor proteins  can physically interact with gl <dig> and egl <dig>  <cit>  as well as compete with gl1  <cit>  to interact with these latter bhlh proteins. although r3myb competition limits the transcriptional activity of the mbw complex, epistatic analysis of gl <dig> and single myb arabidopsis mutants suggest that the r3myb inhibitors do not act directly through gl <dig> in regulating trichome formation  <cit> . ttg <dig> shares function with gl <dig> in the trichome development cascade and its expression is also controlled by the mbw complex  <cit> .

the seven r3myb inhibitor transcription factors inhibiting trichome development include triptychon   <cit> , caprice   <cit> , enhancer of try and cpc  <dig>   <cit> , etc <dig>  <cit> , caprice-like myb  <dig>   <cit> , trichomeless <dig>   <cit> , and tcl <dig>  <cit> . reduced trichome number  affects the number of trichomes produced per leaf, and consequently increases the distance between trichomes on mature leaves  <cit> . over-expression of any of the seven r3myb negative regulatory genes results in a glabrous phenotype in arabidopsis, while mutants of each of these genes show different phenotypes. root hair development is also affected by these genes.

while extensive molecular knowledge exists for trichome development in arabidopsis, an equivalent knowledge base is lacking for brassica crop species. complementation of a glabrous, yellow-seeded arabidopsis ttg <dig> mutant with a brttg <dig> ortholog isolated from a hairy, black-seeded b. rapa line restores brown seed colour, trichome density, seed coat mucilage, anthocyanins, and reduces root hair density to the wild type level, suggesting that bnttg <dig> functions in a similar manner to the arabidopsis atttg <dig>  <cit> . five of the best known trichome regulatory genes have been recently studied in b. villosa  <cit> , which has an extremely dense coverage of trichomes over most of its tissues  <cit> . transformation of b. napus with 35sp::atgl <dig> produces an extremely dense covering of trichomes on b. napus seedling tissues  <cit> . this “hairy canola” line  shows strong feeding deterrence to crucifer flea beetles  <cit>  and modest resistance to larvae of the diamondback moth  <cit> . however, it also showed stunted growth, and after five generations these plants were still more than one week late in maturation. moreover, the impact of ttg <dig> transcript levels relative to those of other trichome regulatory genes in the brassicas and the molecular basis of trichome development in most brassica species are still unknown  <cit> , although genome sequencing is now offering exciting new opportunities to study these genes  <cit> . additionally, the effects that trichome development genes may have on brassica metabolite pathways, overall plant development, growth, and seed yield have yet to be evaluated.

in an attempt to address several of these issues, bnttg <dig> transcript levels were modified in two b. napus recipient genetic backgrounds: semi-glabrous cv westar and the “hairy canola” line atgl3+b. napus. the reduction of bnttg <dig> transcript levels in the hairy atgl3+b. napus background resulted in new ultra-hairy “hairy canola” lines, with high trichome density, expanded trichome coverage and length, and restored growth and time to maturity. in contrast, over-expression of bnttg <dig> in the hairy background resulted in loss of vitality and a glabrous  trichome and growth phenotype. transcriptome analyses in young leaves of one of the ultra-hairy lines and the original hairy line provide insight into the impact of the combined manipulation of atgl <dig> and bnttg <dig> gene expression on expression of various trichome, plant growth, biochemical, and defence pathways in b. napus.

RESULTS
transgenic plant growth and fertility phenotypes
none of the bnttg <dig> over-expression or knockdown lines in the semi-glabrous leaf westar recipient background showed any phenotypic differences with respect to plant morphology, trichome coverage, growth or reproduction when compared to westar. hence, representatives of these plants were not advanced to produce homozygous lines due to greenhouse space limitations.

in contrast, the o-ttg <dig> lines  showed substantial changes to phenotype and were usually non-viable . of the seven confirmed o-ttg <dig> t <dig> transformants in the hairy background, five showed slow growth, a fully glabrous phenotype, and did not flower, eventually dying. only two single-insertion t <dig> glabrous o-ttg <dig> plants  survived to flowering after transfer to soil. both of these plants grew taller than the atgl3+b. napus plants, but only o- <dig> produced siliques . of the five t <dig> o- <dig> seeds, only one germinated and produced a plant with seeds. of ten glabrous progeny t <dig> seeds, only three germinated and only one of the resulting glabrous plants  flowered and produced seeds. leaves of all t <dig> o-3- <dig> plants were dark green and glabrous, and the plants were taller and faster growing compared to atgl3+b. napus plants and t <dig> o- <dig> seed, but slower and with shorter stature when evaluated side-by-side with westar for growth . these somewhat healthier glabrous o-3- <dig> seedlings  also produced 20 % less seed of lower quality  under greenhouse conditions  compared to westar.table  <dig> transformation efficiency with bnttg <dig> manipulation: survival and viable seed set of confirmed transformants

sixteen months later, t <dig> o-3- <dig> seedlings from two different seed lots  were each grown over two periods  to re-evaluate the plants prior to 1st leaf q-pcr analysis. each seed lot, growth period, and growth condition generated the same two unique growth phenotypes in a 1: <dig> segregation ratio, both of which included only trichome-bearing leaves. phenotype  <dig> plants grew moderately tall like the atgl3+b. napus line and t <dig> o-3- <dig> plants, while phenotype  <dig> grew only to ~2 cm in height , then became yellowish and died .

of the nine independent k-ttg <dig> positive lines in atgl3+b. napus, four t <dig> plants contained a single transgene insert and presented two distinct growth and trichome phenotypes. k <dig> and k <dig> plants showed growth characteristics and leaf/stem trichome coverage similar to atgl3+b. napus plants; however, k- <dig> and k <dig> plants showed restored growth characteristics identical to westar and new trichome phenotypes detailed below. from these latter plants, the t <dig> homozygous lines k-5- <dig> and k-6- <dig> were developed. in greenhouse growth studies, k-6- <dig> and k-5- <dig> grew more vigorously than atgl3+b. napus plants and o-3- <dig> plants resulting in robust plants similar to westar . seed yield of greenhouse-grown k-5- <dig> was also similar to that for westar.

trichome phenotypes
trichome densities in arabidopsis vary proximal to distal along the leaf surface and along the leaf edge and show trichome branching. all b. napus k-ttg <dig> and o-ttg <dig> lines developed in the semi-glabrous westar background were identical to westar in trichome density, trichome shape , and trichome length . hence these plants were not evaluated further due to greenhouse limitations.

in contrast, seedling leaves and stems of o-ttg <dig> in the hairy atgl3+b. napus  were completely glabrous . this glabrous phenotype was unstable, since t <dig> o-3-7- <dig> and o-3-7- <dig> plants derived from the two independently generated seed lots showed only hairy leaves in two new trichome phenotypes linked with the new growth phenotypes: one type  displayed a leaf trichome density which was intermediate between the density of hairy atgl3+ leaves and semi-glabrous westar leaves . the other type  showed leaf trichome density somwhat higher than westar, but less dense than on tall t <dig> leaves .

in k-5- <dig> and k-6- <dig>  the two ttg <dig> knockdown plants in the hairy atgl3+b. napus background, trichome densities and distribution patterns on young leaves were similar to the hairy atgl3+b. napus line, but enhanced after the third leaf stage when trichome density declines in the atgl3+ line . trichome densities measured on the edges of the first two leaves of k-5- <dig> were significantly higher  than in atgl3+b. napus plants, while the fourth leaf edges of k-5- <dig> had more than double the number of trichomes compared to atgl3+b. napus . this number increased to over  <dig> trichomes per cm on the fifth and sixth leaves of k-5- <dig> . k-5- <dig> plants also produced more trichomes, resulting in higher densities  on the adaxial surface of first to sixth leaves than on atgl3+b. napus plants and on the the abaxial leaf mid-vein of the fourth leaf . in fact, both k-5- <dig> and k-6- <dig> produced dense trichome patterning on leaves and petioles up to the 11th or 12th leaf stage, whereas trichome densities decreased on leaves of atgl3+b. napus plants after the third leaf. the differences in trichome densities were magnified with leaf expansion, with the leaves of atgl3+b. napus, eventually becoming virtually semi-glabrous and similar to leaves of westar at maturity.fig.  <dig> scanning electron micrographs showing representative differential distribution of trichomes on leaf surfaces of two distinct transgenic hairy canola lines: hairy atgl3+-enhanced b. napus and ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> . a, c. first leaf , and b, d. sixth leaf . white size bars represent 1 mm.

petioles of atgl3+b. napus had higher trichome densities  for first and second leaves compared with k-5- <dig> , but this declined on the third leaf petiole, with decreasing density up to the sixth leaf stage. petiole trichome densities for later stage k-5- <dig> leaves were within the range of those for the first leaf . furthermore, large numbers of trichomes were found on the stems of k-5- <dig> and k-6- <dig> plants above the first node and internode, a phenotype not present in atgl3+b. napus plants . occasionally trichomes also formed on the peduncle of k-5- <dig> plants, while this tissue was always glabrous in atgl3+b. napus plants . this expanded coverage of leaf and stem trichome density was observed through five subsequent generations  of k-5- <dig> plants, suggesting a stable phenotype.

k-5- <dig> and atgl3+b. napus produced distinct and different patterns of trichome clustering and trichome morphology. trichomes were typically unbranched, fully developed, straight, and consistently longer by 100 μm on k-5- <dig> than those on atgl3+b. napus plants . short aborted trichomes were produced on leaves of both plant lines, but with a much higher frequency on atgl3+b. napus leaves than on k-5- <dig> leaves, especially after the third leaf . clusters were present approximately two times more frequently on k-5- <dig> than on atgl3+b. napus. the typical number of trichomes in a atgl3+b. napus cluster was usually two to three, whereas k-5- <dig> produced clusters of up to five trichomes .fig.  <dig> trichome lengths and morphologies on ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> and hairy atgl3+

q-pcr of six trichome regulatory genes using rna from distinct leaf batches
q-pcr was conducted on bulked batch rna samples from 1st to 3rd leaves  and 4th to 6th leaves  using plant lines with different leaf trichome phenotypes. k-5- <dig> leaves were hairy in both batches. t <dig> o-3- <dig> leaves were glabrous in both batches, westar were semi-glabrous in both batches, and atgl3+b. napus plants were hairy only in batch  <dig>  while batch  <dig> were semi-glabrous. at the time of this experiment, the instability and reversion of the o-3- <dig> line into two growth and trichome-bearing phenotypes had not surfaced.

summarized transcript levels were measured for atgl <dig> and the composite of all homologues for each of five b. napus trichome regulatory genes, bngl <dig>  bngl <dig>  bngl <dig>  bnttg <dig> and bntry, known to be involved in mbw tri-protein complex activity in arabidopsis. additional file 2: tables s1b and s1c describe the number of expected gene copies that likely would be measured in b. napus batch leaf samples using specific primers designed to detect as many orthologues and paralogues possible for each gene. the relative expression of the b. napus acyl transferase  <dig>  control gene was stable with low variability  in all leaf batches for all four lines and allowed for comparison across q-pcr plates . as expected, bnttg <dig> over-expression in glabrous o-3- <dig> leaves was 50-fold higher  compared to westar and atgl3+b. napus leaves and 500-fold higher compared with the k-5- <dig> line, while the bnttg1-knockdown line k-5- <dig> showed >50-fold lower bnttg <dig> transcript levels than both westar and atgl3+b. napus . the bnttg <dig> primers used in this analysis could potentially have amplified as many as five orthologous copies, but more realistically two as these were more strongly detectable in young 1st leaves by rna sequencing  , although the batch leaf samples covering more leaf developmental stages may have had a different gene copy number. in contrast, atgl <dig> expression was highly variable and highest in expression in both leaf batches of k-5- <dig>  whereas atgl <dig> expression in glabrous o-3- <dig> leaves was intermediate between k-5- <dig> and atgl3+b. napus leaves.fig.  <dig> combined relative expression  of six trichome regulatory genes by q-pcr in two leaf tissue batches of seedlings from semi-glabrous b. napus cv westar , hairy atgl3+

primers for bngl <dig> could only retrieve one b. napus sequence from ncbi and none from est databases or http://brassicadb.org/brad/, but ncbi actually held  <dig> additional b. napus genes that did not show up in the blast search and two had 100 % primer identity . moreover, three of these bngl <dig> genes had been detected by rna sequencing in young leaf tissue. in the batch leaf tissue, relative composite expression of bngl <dig> was constant and relatively low across most lines, although bngl <dig> had somewhat higher expression in westar. bngl <dig> expression was also constant and low, potentially representing as many as three copies. bngl <dig> expression  was low in westar, atgl3+b. napus and o-3- <dig> leaf batches and 3-fold higher in k-5- <dig> leaves . here, the primers would likely have detected only two b. napus copies.

a very low transcript level was detected for bntry  in leaf batch 1– <dig>  from all four lines. this level potentially represented the combined expression of as many as four b. napus try genes  . however, the only database that retrieved try genes was the b. rapa database. bntry batch leaf expression remained consistently low between all four lines  regardless of a trichome or glabrous phenotype, but expression increased two-fold in leaf batch 4– <dig> ,

trichome-related differential gene expression using rna sequencing of first leaves
prompted by the q-pcr expression patterns of three trichrome regulatory genes  in several of the batch-leaf q-pcr reactions, we carried out total rna sequencing of the first leaf in ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> and hairy atgl3+b. napus relative to semi-glabrous westar before emergence of the second leaf. this was intended to determine the impact of our gene manipulations on individual b. napus homologues of well-known trichome regulatory genes and less-well known trichome genes. at the time of rna sequencing, the glabrous leaf bnttg <dig> knockdown line  and its revertant plants were not available due to infertility and death of glabrous plants carrying the o-ttg <dig> construct. a total of  <dig> trichome genes determined by a recent survey of tair and the literature  <cit>  , were evaluated for changes in expression in atgl3+b. napus, k-5- <dig>  and westar. one hundred  trichome genes  were differentially expressed in k-5- <dig> relative to westar, with  <dig> orthologues  mapping to b. oleracea and  <dig> orthologues  to b. rapa  . in contrast, only  <dig> b. oleracea-type orthologues  and five b. rapa-type orthologues  showed expression changes in atgl3+b. napus leaves.

at this early stage of leaf development , very few changes in trichome regulatory gene expression were observed in the atgl3+b. napus line relative to westar. four regulatory genes, including, b. rapa and b. oleracea orthologues of the myb-like  <dig>   <cit> , one bottg <dig>  and one bogl <dig> orthologue  were strongly  up-regulated in the first leaf of atgl3+b. napus, while a boduf <dig> orthologue  and the homeodomain brglabrous  <dig>  orthologue were significantly down-regulated . four other b. napus ttg <dig> genes were not significantly different  in atgl3+b. napus compared with westar at this leaf stage: bra <dig>  bra <dig>  bra <dig>  and bra <dig>  . curiously, significant expression differences  were not detected in young atgl3+b. napus leaves for two gl3s, four egl3s , three gl1s, eight trys, five caprices , six caprice-likes , and two enhancer of try and cpc <dig>  relative to westar leaves, all of which were detectable at least to some degree by rna sequencing . however, several genes of these non-significant genes also had higher numerical mean differences in atgl3+ b. napus relative to westar , but with very high variability .table  <dig>

in contrast to atgl3+b. napus,  <dig> trichome-related ests were significantly up-regulated and  <dig> were significantly down-regulated  in the first leaf of k-5- <dig> relative to westar  included bogl <dig> and brgl <dig> orthologues, three myb-like <dig> orthologues, two scarecrow-like  <dig> orthologues , and the repressor of gibberellin  <dig>   <cit> . down-regulated k-5- <dig> regulatory ests  included a bopirogi gene, a bonap <dig> transcription factor, copies of the duf <dig> gene, three cdks , three cycd3; <dig>  and two cyca2; <dig> genes, homeobox-leucine zipper protein genes , and two myb <dig> . significant expression differences  were not detected in k-5- <dig> first leaves  for  <dig> common regulatory genes. these non-significant expression patterns included the five ttg <dig> genes , as well as two gl3s, four egl3s , three gl1s, eight trys, five caprices , six caprice-likes , and two enhancer of try and cpc <dig> , all of which were detectable but some with very low expression. again, several of these non-significant genes also had numerically different means in k-5- <dig> relative to westar, , but with very high variability .

global transcriptome analysis of metabolic, structural, regulatory, and redox genes
global changes in metabolite gene expression patterns obtained from rna sequencing were also compared across the first leaves of atgl3+b. napus, k-5- <dig> and westar. a massively higher number of genes  were significantly differentially expressed in k-5- <dig>  compared with atgl3+b. napus   . of the  <dig> differentially expressed est set for atgl3+b. napus,  <dig>  were also common to k-5- <dig>  while  <dig> were unique to the atgl3+b. napus transcriptome. in contrast,  <dig>  ests were differentially expressed only in k-5- <dig>  with the proportion of up and down-regulated genes being equal.fig.  <dig> venn diagram representing the total number of differentially expressed genes  in first leaves of hairy atgl3+

a broad spectrum of differentially expressed metabolic genes not previously noted as targets of the gl <dig> or ttg <dig> transgenes was identified by mapping the est sets to  <dig> mapman functional categories . total down-regulated and up-regulated genes and major functional categories clearly showed that the vast majority of transcript changes occured in k-5- <dig> leaves. these major categories included protein signalling, rna, cell transport and development, whereas transcript levels for very few genes in these categories were altered in atgl3+b. napus . instead, down-regulation of five ethylene pathway genes, three erf homologues , and three genes in the auxin pathway was observed in atgl3+b. napus . in addition, transcription factors known to regulate plant growth were down-regulated in atgl3+b. napus relative to b. napus westar , while a host of such tfs were up-regulated and down-regulated in k-5- <dig> . up-regulated k-5- <dig> tfs included those coding for multiple zinc finger proteins , basic helix loop helix  dna binding proteins, developmental proteins , myb proteins, flowering proteins , and wrky family transcription factors. down-regulated k-5- <dig> tfs included myb-like factors  and bhlhs, among others.fig.  <dig> histogram illustrating numbers of differentially expressed genes  determined by rna sequencing of first leaves of transgenic hairy  and ultra-hairy  b. napus lines  in  <dig> mapman functional categories . data was collected by rna sequencing. only genes with >2-fold significantly different transcript levels relative to b. napus cv. westar at p <  <dig>  are indicated. red indicates numbers of down-regulated genes. blue indicates numbers of up-regulated genes



expression of cell wall carbohydrate and protein genes was also altered in both atgl3+b. napus and k-5-8; but again, far more of these genes were differentially expressed in k-5- <dig>  with only six uniquely upregulated in atgl3+b. napus . k-5- <dig> also had more dramatic changes in expression levels of ests involved in growth and development, photosynthetic light reactions, calvin cycle, amino acid synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, cell wall and lipid synthesis, with atkcr <dig> , kcs  and cer <dig>  involved in wax regulation only affected in k-5- <dig> .

in genes specifying redox pathways, two plant ascorbate oxidase genes were differentially expressed only in atgl3+b. napus, while the remainder of redox ests predominantly were found in k-5- <dig> leaves . genes specifying secondary metabolism were also differentially expressed in young b. napus leaves. in particular, 184 k-5- <dig> ests were mapped to i) flavonoids and phenylpropanoids categories  ii) lignans and cell wall lignin , iii) terpenoids , iv) simple phenolics , v) shikimates , vi) s-metabolism  , and vii) n-metabolism   . in contrast, only  <dig> differentially expressed secondary metabolite ests were identified in atgl3+b. napus leaves relative to westar and the  <dig> flavonoid ests increased in atgl3+b. napus were unchanged in k-5- <dig> . moreover, pal <dig> was up-regulated in k-5- <dig> and transcripts for two copies of pal <dig> were 2-fold less compared with westar leaves . in contrast, expression of pal <dig> and pal <dig> was upregulated in atgl3+b. napus compared to westar. transcript levels for chs, dfr, and ans were confirmed via q-pcr  <cit> .

q-pcr of individual redox, cell wall, and trichome gene orthologues in first true leaves
q-pcr analysis was conducted on five redox, four cell wall carbohydrate, two lignin, and eight trichome regulatory genes and one trichome cell wall gene using first true leaves of semi-glabrous westar, hairy atgl3+b. napus, ultra-hairy k-5- <dig>  and t <dig> o-3- <dig> plants. these o-3- <dig> plants were derived from seeds of fully glabrous t <dig> plants , but the t <dig> o-3- <dig> plants showed partial “reversion” into two types of growth phenotypes, each linked with trichome-bearing leaves. q-pcr was conducted only 1st leaves of larger t <dig> o-3- <dig> “revertant” plants with intermediate trichome density, since the very small t <dig> o-3- <dig> growth phenotype with lower trichome density was unhealthy and died before sufficient leaf tissue could be harvested for rna extraction  and t <dig> glabrous plants were no longer available to test . the purpose of this q-pcr experiment was to determine whether trichome and growth gene expression profiles and phenotypes in first leaves were consistent with q-pcr expression patterns for trichome genes in leaf batches  and rna sequencing in first leaves , particularly for bnttg <dig> knockdown in k-5- <dig> and over-expression in o-3- <dig> 

q-pcr expression analysis of the bnttg <dig> bra <dig> orthologue was extremely high in the moderately hairy o-3- <dig> revertant leaves and very low in ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> leaves . expression of bra <dig> in westar and the atgl3+b. napus line was numerically higher than in k-5- <dig> at this leaf stage but not significantly different. this q-pcr result was consistent with the lack of significantly different expression for this gene in westar, atgl3+b. napus, and k-5- <dig> first leaves by rna sequencing . it also confirmed the continued presence of a viable bnttg <dig> over-expression construct in the remaining o plants regardless of the “reversion” to a trichome phenotype. bnegl <dig> bo9g <dig> and bngl <dig> bra <dig> orthologues also showed very low q-pcr expression, with no significant differences of the means between the four lines , although expression of these two trichome genes was numerically lower in k-5- <dig> in the latter experiment.fig.  <dig> relative expression  of individual orthologous genes for a range of redox, cell wall carbohydrate, lignin, and trichome genes in young seedling first leaves of semi-glabrous b. napus cv westar , hairy atgl3+

in contrast, q-pcr-based expression levels for bngl <dig> bra <dig>  the two bngl <dig> orthologues bo6g <dig> and bra <dig>  and the two bntry orthologues bo9g <dig> and bra <dig> were 10-, 63-, 73-, 5- and 3-fold higher, respectively, in hairy atgl3+b. napus first leaf relative to semi-glabrous westar . this was consistent with rna sequencing in which bngl <dig> bo6g <dig> was significantly higher, bngl <dig> bra <dig> almost significantly higher, and bngl <dig> bra <dig> and bntry bo9g <dig> numerically higher  in atgl3+b. napus . in the ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> and moderately hairy o-3-7- <dig> leaves, q-pcr expression of the bngl <dig> bra <dig> was identical to westar . however, the two tested bngl <dig> orthologues showed significantly different q-pcr expression patterns when both genes were compared with each other in the two constructed lines, such that brgl <dig> bo6g <dig> was higher in ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> compared with moderately hairy o-3-7- <dig> first leaves, but the bogl <dig> bra <dig> orthologue was identical in expression level between these two lines. both gl <dig> genes were intermediate expressors in these two constructed lines compared with semi-glabrous westar and hairy atgl3+b. napus . moreover, the two bntry test orthologues bo9g <dig> and bra <dig> showed inverse expression patterns in ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> compared with moderately hairy o-3-7- <dig> first leaves . one trichome-specific structural gene, birefringence  <dig> , proposed to specify cell wall polysaccharide o-acetyltransferase, showed a higher expression pattern in atgl3+b. napus, k-5- <dig>  and o-3-7- <dig> relative to westar consistent with trichome phenotypes , but this correlation did not hold true for bif <dig>  .

four redox genes, catalase <dig>  cat <dig> , fe superoxide dismutase <dig> , and mnsod <dig> , three cell wall carbohydrate genes, expansin <dig> , cellulose synthase-like b <dig> , and xyloglucan endotransglucosylase hydrolase , and the lignin gene cinnamoyl coa reductase <dig>  were expressed at low levels  in first leaves of all four tested lines . of these low-expressing genes, the brcat <dig> orthologue showed significantly higher expression in first leaves of the most robust line  and lower in less robust o-3-7- <dig> relative to robust westar, while expression in the less robust atgl3+b. napus line was closest to the o-3-7- <dig> line. brcat <dig> and bofesod <dig> orthologues also showed highest overall expression in k-5- <dig> leaves and lowest to o-3-7- <dig> . moreover, q-pcr expression levels for the low-expressing orthologue braxth <dig> and three high-expressing orthologues for copper chaperone for sod <dig> , pectin methylesterase , and ccr <dig>  were consistently higher in the two less robust lines compared with robust lines . in contrast, a reverse q-pcr expression pattern occurred for low-expressing bomnsod <dig> and bracslb <dig>  such that their expression was highest in o-3-7- <dig> leaves and lowest in k-5- <dig> leaves, while expression levels for ccr <dig> were no different for the four lines and expa <dig> expression was inconsistent with growth phenotypes.

the cat <dig>  cat <dig>  expa <dig> _and pme <dig> q-pcr patterns for first leaves were consistent with rna sequencing expression patterns for atgl3+b. napus, and k-5- <dig> relative to westar, while fesod <dig>  mnsod <dig>  cuchap, cslb <dig>  xth <dig>  ccr <dig> patterns were inconsistent between the two expression techniques . overall relative expression levels of fesod <dig>  cat <dig>  pme <dig>  and ccr <dig> compared with cat <dig>  mnsod, cslb <dig>  and ccr <dig> were also inconsistent between the two experiments.

discussion
mis-expression of bnttg <dig> together with atgl <dig> affects growth and trichome patterning
ttg <dig> is a wd <dig> trichome regulatory gene known to have pleiotropic effects in arabidopsis  <cit> . complexed with gl <dig> and myb proteins, ttg <dig> directly regulates trichome patterning on arabidopsis leaves  <cit> . however, very little is known on how gl <dig> and ttgi impact plant development and trichome patterning in brassicas.

in this study, expression level of bnttg <dig> was manipulated in two ways in a atgl3+b. napus ‘hairy canola’ background  <cit> ). this resulted in pleiotropic effects on plant growth and development . earlier generations of the atgl3+b. napus background line had shown some depression of growth and fertility, which had lessened in severity such that this background line was stable and only slightly shorter in stature and a week later in development compared to b. napus westar. knockdown of bnttg <dig> in this hairy atgl3+b. napus background restored normal  greenhouse growth and development to stable ultra-hairy k-6- <dig> and k-5- <dig> lines. in contrast, over-expression of bnttg <dig> in this same hairy background resulted in a shorter, very low-fertility glabrous t <dig> homozygous phenotype . this only remaining o-line was unstable, since it generated two new t <dig> phenotypes . altered growth or trichome phenotypes were not observed in b. napus westar background plants over-expressing bnttg <dig> or knocked down in this gene, but these latter plants are still heterozygous and could be masking phenotypes we were unable to detect.

the restoration of a normal westar growth phenotype in ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> and k-6- <dig> down-regulated in bnttg <dig> expression and the opposite growth and trichome phenotype in o-3- <dig> suggests that a combination of high levels of gl <dig> and ttg <dig> transcripts negatively impacts b. napus growth above and beyond when gl <dig> transcription alone is enhanced. this is supported by reduced transcript levels for select cell wall, hormone, and wax genes in atgl3+b. napus leaves , but much more extreme changes in gene expression levels and gene diversity in k-5- <dig> leaves for genes involved in growth and development, photosynthetic light reactions, calvin cycle, amino acid synthesis, mitochondrial electron transport, cell wall, and lipids . these expression and phenotype data infer a window of ttg <dig> expression levels that maintains optimal growth and is supported by the fact that k <dig> and k <dig> plants within the same bn-ttg <dig> knockdown transgenic series, but having less extreme reductions in bnttg <dig> transcript levels, maintain an unaltered atgl3+b. napus growth and trichome phenotype.

expression of atgl <dig> in b. napus and rnai knockdown or overexpression of bnttg <dig> within the atgl3+b. napus background used transgene constructs under the control of a strong constitutive promoter . this would lead to mis-expression of these two trichome regulatory genes outside of their usual expression range, developmental time, and tissue, and would simultaneously affect other trichome genes/proteins they normally do not regulate when controlled by their own promoters. as well, it would affect other genes and proteins that impact on many different cellular factors, including those which affect growth and plant health. in silico microarray data from the efp browser  and the tileviz browser  shows that the closely related atttg <dig> is normally expressed throughout arabidopsis  over a range of developmental stages and tissues  and usually has 10-fold higher expression than atgl <dig> , which normally has a more limited expression . this type of complete developmental expression map for the main trichome regulatory genes and different biochemical, growth, and health genes would be very useful to develop in a crop species like b. napus, since it would give us additional tools with which to analyze the impact of manipulating these  genes for practical purposes. mis-expression is a main feature of all transgenes under 35sp control, but the impact of mis-expression would be much broader using a regulatory transgene than a structural gene, which would have a more limited biochemical impact . however, there is still a limited possibility that some type of interaction has occurred between the two 35s promoters themselves to cause the phenotypes observed in k-5- <dig>  k-6- <dig>  and o-3- <dig>  the fact that we recovered two independent transgenic events with k-5- <dig> phenotypes suggests that at least the bnttg <dig> knockdown within the atgl3+ background can generate the same stable phenotypes regardless of having two 35s promoters within the same germplasm.

the low viability and poor seed quality and yield of the o-type bnttg <dig> over-expression within the atgl3+ background and the instability of the growth and trichome phenotypes in the t <dig> generation shows that an over-abundance of bnttg <dig> and atgl <dig> transcripts negatively impacts on plant health and stability. in a range of arabidopsis backgrounds, seedling lethality has been shown to result from the combined over-expression of gl <dig> together with a maize bhlh r gene, although gl <dig> enhancement by itself has no effect on viability  <cit> . the most vigorous of these latter arabidopsis plants are homozygous ttg <dig>  hence, it appears that growth and development in both b. napus and arabidopsis are sensitive to the proportion and level of ttg <dig> and bhlh  expression.

bnttg <dig> and bntry may have different roles in b. napus
atttg <dig> over-expression in arabidopsis does not increase trichome density above the background level  <cit>  even though arabidopsis ttg <dig> null mutants initiate very few trichomes  <cit> . similarly, our b. napus studies showed that over-expression or knockdown of ttg <dig> in the semi-glabrous westar background had little to no effect on trichome density, although these plants are still heterozygous and should eventually be re-evaluated in homozygous lines. in contrast, over-expression of bnt <dig> in the hairy atgl3+b. napus background  produced fully glabrous leaf and stem phenotypes, although the glabrous leaf phenotype was unstable in the only surviving t <dig> seed line when t <dig> plants showed a “reversion” to trichome densites intermediate between the semi-glabrous westar leaf and the hairy atgl3+ leaf. however, knockdown of ttg <dig> in this hairy atgl3+b. napus background produced stable plant lines  with broader trichome coverage, higher trichome densities, and longer trichomes, i.e., ultra-‘hairy canola’. these opposite trichome phenotypes produced when using the hairy atgl3+ background strongly suggest that the high transcript level for ttg <dig> in leaves of westar negatively impacts trichome development . in arabidopsis, transcription of the trichome outgrowth gene gl <dig> is controlled by a tri-protein activator complex gl1-gl3-ttg <dig>  with gl <dig> and gl <dig> binding directly to the gl <dig> promoter  <cit> . while atttg <dig> does not bind directly to the gl <dig> promoter, it is thought to be a positive regulator necessary for stabilizing arabidopsis gl1-gl <dig> di-protein complexes through its association with gl <dig>  instead, our q-pcr results support the role of bnttg <dig> as a negative regulator of trichome initiation in b. napus by the decreased expression of gl <dig> in q-pcr batch leaf experiments when an elevated gl <dig> level  was coupled with over-expression of bnttg <dig> .

manipulation of bnttg <dig> transcript levels appeared to raise the q-pcr batch leaf transcript level of atgl <dig> in both the glabrous o-3- <dig> over-expression plants and the ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> plants compared with westar and the atgl3+b. napus plants, even though bnttg <dig> batch leaf transcript levels were completely opposite in these k-5- <dig> and t <dig> o-3- <dig> plants. in fact, the levels of atgl <dig> were much higher in k-5- <dig> leaf batches than in atgl3+b. napus leaf batches. moreover, transcript levels for composite and individual bngl <dig> orthologues were much higher for atgl3+b. napus than for k-5- <dig> in both leaf batches and first leaf q-pcr experiments even though trichome length and coverage were only expanded in k-5- <dig>  these expression patterns should be explored in more detail using two ultra-hairy lines  and by replacing the atgl <dig> gene with a range of brassica gl <dig> orthologous genes to determine whether these expression patterns are plant-specific, gene-source specific, or a more generalized pattern.

trichome initiation is not affected in arabidopsis gl <dig> mutants, although shorter aborted trichome cells expand laterally over the leaf surface  <cit> . similar short trichomes are also observed in an arabidopsis gl <dig> mutant  <cit> . thus, the arabidopsis model suggests that increased expression of gl <dig>  is required for proper outgrowth of trichomes  <cit> . while tt1g mutations in reduce gl <dig> expression, expression of a 35s::r  transgene in a ttg <dig> arabidopsis background increases atgl <dig> expression  <cit> . similarly, an elevated atgl <dig> expression in arabidopsis bypasses the ttg <dig> requirement to induce gl <dig> expression  <cit> . likewise in b. napus, higher expression of gl <dig> occurs in leaf batches  of k-5- <dig> relative to atgl3+b. napus, and this batch leaf expression profile correlated with increased trichome length. however, aborted trichomes on the leaf surface of atgl3+b. napus did not expand laterally along the leaf surface, as in arabidopsis. instead, their growth was arrested immediately in b. napus after trichome initiation. these observations, together with the invariable  gl <dig> expression found in batch leaf q-pcr analysis of all four b. napus line, suggest that bngl <dig> also controls b. napus trichome length and out-growth in b. napus and that strong ttg <dig> transcription together with strong gl <dig> expression inhibits this process.

clusters of trichomes are found along the leaf margins of weak alleles of arabidopsis try and ttg <dig> mutants  <cit> . k-5- <dig> also showed trichome clustering on leaf margins, suggesting a role for bnttg <dig> in the lateral inhibition of trichome formation in neighbouring cells of b. napus. the composite weak expression of bntry in both glabrous and trichome-bearing q-pcr leaf batches, as well as the stronger expression of bntry orthologues in first leaves ultra-hairy k-5- <dig> and hairy atgl3+ plants suggest that try may have functions other than inhibiting trichome initiation in the brassicas. this hypothesis is supported by the high expression of bvtry in leaves with a dense coverage of trichomes in ultra-hairy b. villosa   <cit> .

high expression of the atgl <dig> affects transcription of bngl3
arabidopsis atgl <dig> expression is controlled by an autoregulatory feedback loop, such that it binds to its own promoter to negatively regulate its own gene expression  <cit> . in our b. napus experiments, over-expression of the atgl <dig> transgene resulted in decreased  expression of bngl <dig> compared to westar, suggesting that the b. napus gl <dig> promoter may be negatively regulated by an excess of atgl <dig>  amino acid alignments between atgl <dig> and its five bngl <dig> homologues show a range of homologies  that may impact on whether or not the bngl <dig> proteins can also bind to the bngl <dig> promoter. . the gl <dig> proteins might also compete for binding sites on gl <dig> promoters  <cit> . screening bngl <dig> proteins for sequences with binding capability to bngl <dig> and bngl <dig> promoters by conducting one-hybrid and bimolecular binding studies are next steps that could lead towards an understanding of how similar or distinct the b. napus trichome regulatory circuit is compared with the arabidopsis model.

bnttg <dig> knockdown in an atgl3-enhanced background affects a host of metabolite pathways in b. napus
arabidopsis bhlh genes, such as gl <dig>  egl <dig>  atmyc <dig>  and the flavonoid gene transparent testa  <dig> , are intertwined with ttg <dig> in several pathways. they participate in tri-protein complexes  <cit> , and they also regulate late-stage flavonoid biosynthesis genes . in arabidopsis, over-expression of atgl <dig> in a wild type background up-regulates expression of the structural genes dihydroflavonol 4-reductase  and anthocyanidin synthase  from the flavonoid pathway. the promoters of both dfr and ans are activated in arabidopsis by the mbw complex, and expression of both genes is down-regulated in ttg <dig> mutants  <cit> . similarly, strong expression of 35sp::atgl <dig> in b. napus resulted in increased red pigmentation in seedlings  and transcription of genes in the flavonoid pathway, but interfered somewhat with plant growth. growth was even more negatively impacted by strong atgl <dig> expression together with an up-regulation of bnttg <dig> in o-3- <dig> 

coupling strong atgl <dig> enhancement with the knockdown of bnttg <dig>  resulted in the decline of leaf flavonoid transcript levels to westar levels or lower and fully restored growth. more important, the combined impact of atgl <dig> expression and decreased bnttg <dig> transcription in k-5- <dig> had a massive impact on the number  of differentially expressed genes from a broad range of metabolic pathways producing phenylpropanoids, simple phenolics, shikimates, isoprenoids, terpenes, glucosinolates ,alkaloids, structural carbohydrates, lignin, pectin, and redox proteins important for cell wall growth, plant health, and stress protection. opposite q-pcr expression patterns were found for several of these genes between 1st true leaves of k-5- <dig> and t <dig> o-3-7- <dig> “revertants” or between other growth phenotypes. in contrast, the addition of the atgl <dig> gene alone had far less impact on leaf gene expression, such that only  <dig> unique genes and  <dig> degs were down-regulated and  <dig> unique degs and  <dig> common degs up-regulated in atgl3+b. napus leaves compared with westar control leaves, while the k-5- <dig> leaves had a reduction of  <dig>  unique degs and an induction of  <dig>  unique degs. potentially, bnttg <dig> protein titre is reduced in k-5- <dig> leaves, a situation which may positively affect  the availability of a large portion of gl <dig> protein tied up  in atgl3+b. napus and able to impact these other biochemical pathways. studies on atgl <dig> and bnttg <dig> protein availability and titre in non-trichome bearing cells of these unique lines may prove fruitful in understanding the mechanism by which these two genes interact to modify growth and metabolism.

CONCLUSIONS
this study is the first to identify the involvement of bnttg <dig> knockdown  in restoring growth and enhancing trichome density, coverage, and length and impacting the transcription of many different biochemical and transcription pathways in b. napus. it also highlights transcription factors and other gene targets which could be tested in bimolecular complementation experiments and dna binding studies to identify components that underly this broad effect on cell metabolism and growth. the fact that over-expression of bnttg <dig> in the atgl3+ background is highly lethal and represses trichome development , supports our hypothesis that ttg <dig> inhibits trichome development in b. napus. the seed lines generated from this study represent valuable germplasm with which to determine the nature of the instability of these latter plants. since the growth of the new ultra-hairy b. napus canola is now restored and trichome coverage is enhanced compared with the original atgl3+ hairy canola, the two novel plant lines  should now be advanced into field trials to test their agronomic characteristics and insect tolerance.
