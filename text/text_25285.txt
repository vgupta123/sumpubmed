BACKGROUND
among primary renal tumors the most common is renal cell carcinoma . although earlier detection of rcc has positively influenced patient outcomes  <cit> , predicting both disease progression and patient response to treatment is difficult, due in part to the lack of suitable molecular markers  <cit> .

fabp <dig> belongs to a mammalian family of at least nine proteins that are specifically expressed in diverse tissues such as liver, intestine, heart, adipose tissue, epidermis, brain, peripheral nervous system, and testis  <cit> . several members of the fabp family play important roles in regulating metabolism and have been implicated in contributing to the development of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome  <cit> .

studies on human tumors and tumor-derived cell lines have indicated both fabp7's potential involvement in tumorigenesis and usefulness as a tumor marker  <cit> . expression analyses have demonstrated fabp <dig> transcripts in tumors or urine of patients with rcc  <cit> , as well as in tissues in those with glioblastoma  <cit>  and melanoma  <cit> . fabp <dig> mrna  <cit>  and fabp <dig> protein  <cit>  are overexpressed in rcc. fabp <dig> overexpression correlates with shorter survival in patients with glioblastoma  <cit>  and melanoma  <cit> , but better outcomes in those with breast cancer  <cit> . fabp7's role as a tumor suppressor is suggested by the finding that its enforced overexpression inhibits proliferation of a breast cancer cell line  <cit> . these findings clearly indicate the importance of determining how fabp <dig> expression is regulated. nfi and pbx/pou binding sites have been found to be present in the fabp <dig> promoter in humans  <cit> . in glioma cell lines, nfi dephosphorylation is correlated with fabp <dig> expression  <cit> . in fact, all four members of the nfi family of transcription factors play key roles in the regulation of fabp <dig> in glioma cell lines  <cit> . sánchez-font et al. have suggested that fabp <dig> overexpression, controlled by the transcription factor pknox <dig>  contributes to down syndrome-associated neurological disorders  <cit> .

here, we investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling fabp <dig> expression in human rcc cell lines.

RESULTS
fabp <dig> expression by rcc cell lines
we previously analyzed fabp <dig> mrna expression in primary surgically resected rccs and were able to detect fabp <dig> mrna in the tumor, but not in normal tissue  <cit> . figure 1a and additional file  <dig> show the results of real-time polymerase chain reaction  analysis of six rcc cell lines for fabp <dig> transcripts. two rcc cell lines  exhibited strong fabp <dig> expression, in contrast to four other rcc cell lines  and a human embryonic kidney cell line . these results differ from our analysis of primary rccs, which expressed fabp <dig> at high frequency   <cit> . we also performed western blot analysis for fabp <dig> expression in these same cell lines . a band corresponding to the major  <dig> kda isoform  <cit>  was detected at the highest level in tuhr14tkb, whereas it was not detectably expressed by hek <dig> and other rcc cell lines . the <dig> kda fabp <dig> isoform potentially generated by alternative splicing  was not detected .

cis-acting elements in the fabp <dig> promoter
we prepared fabp7-luciferase constructs to determine the location of 5'-flanking fabp <dig> regulatory elements active in rcc cell lines. all promoter constructs extend from  <dig> base pairs  downstream from the transcription start site to various upstream sites as described in figure  <dig>  the promoter activity of the - <dig> to + <dig> fabp <dig> fragment in rcc cell lines was 3- to 21-fold higher than that of hek <dig> . fabp <dig> promoter activity did not correlate with mrna and protein expression. the promoter deletion analyses shown in figure 3a and additional file  <dig> demonstrates the presence of a strongly positive cis-regulatory element between nucleotide positions - <dig> and - <dig>  interestingly, a relatively small increase  was exhibited by the hek <dig> transfectant . in order to more precisely localize the promoter site, we conducted detailed deletion analysis between positions - <dig> and - <dig>  summarized in figure 3b and additional file  <dig>  interestingly, the positive regulatory region between - <dig> and - <dig> was more active in rcc cell lines than in hek <dig>  so we conducted more detail deletion analysis of the region between positions - <dig> and - <dig> . compared to the promoter activity of -36+ <dig> construct transfectant, a  <dig> to  <dig> fold increase in luciferase activity was observed with the -72+ <dig> transfectant. in contrast, no increase was observed in hek <dig> . the results demonstrate the presence of multiple positive cis-regulatory elements within the region bounded by nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> 

transcription factor binding to the fabp <dig> promoter
we analyzed the fabp <dig> promoter region in silico using the tfbind  <cit>  and tess  <cit>  programs and by visual inspection with the tess  <cit>  to identify transcription factors binding to the fabp <dig> promoter of - <dig> to - <dig>  oct <dig>  oct <dig>  brn <dig>  c/ebp-α, nfi, c/ebp-β, yy <dig>  and sp <dig> binding sites were found across the promoter region  .

we next performed mobility shift assays to determine the factors binding to the three rcc-specific up-regulated regions of the fabp <dig> promoter. three double-stranded oligonucleotides named upstream probe , middle probe , and downstream probe  , which represent the active regions within the - <dig> to - <dig> sequence  and used the double stranded oligonucleotides as gel shift probes.

the up detected a major band migrating at the same position in all nuclear extracts, and an additional hek293-specific species . a common shifted band  was observed that could be competed by the addition of excess amounts of cold double-stranded oct <dig> or oct <dig> oligonucleotides . however, the addition of anti-oct <dig> or anti-oct <dig> antibody to the binding reaction did not change the band shift pattern . interestingly, the addition of excess amounts of c/ebp-α, oct <dig>  or oct <dig> probes shifted the bands up  . we speculated that some protein-dna binding might prevent weak protein-dna binding shifted up by addition of the cold probe.

to investigate whether the hek293-specific band  was brn2-dependent, addition of brn <dig> antibody to the reactions resulted in a supershift . we could not make clear the reason why brn <dig> oligonucleotide did not change the band shift pattern. it might be the effect of band shift that shifted up the addition of excess amounts of probe . to demonstrate the specificity of the brn <dig> antibody used for these studies, we showed that the hek293-specific band detected by western blot analysis was weaker when brn <dig> was depleted using small interfering rna  . furthermore, the hek293-specific shifted band  was not apparent in brn <dig> specific sirna transfectant.

rcc cell lines expressed more than five times less brn <dig> mrna than hek293s  and brn <dig> protein expression was higher in hek <dig> than rcc cell lines . there was an inverse correlation between fabp <dig> promoter activity  and brn <dig> mrna expression , in hek293s and rccs . this result indicates that brn <dig> represses the fabp <dig> promoter.

bisgrove et al. reported that nfi binds to the region bounded by nucleotides - <dig> to - <dig> bp of the fabp <dig> promoter  <cit> , corresponding to the middle probe , and point mutations in this region attenuate fabp <dig> promoter activity. when we performed gel shift analysis with mp, a major dna-protein complex was observed in all seven cell lines . the band marked by the blue arrow was competed by an nfi oligonucleotide in hek <dig> cell line and tuhr14tkb cell line . addition of the anti-nfi antibody to the binding reaction supershifted the nfi-dna complex in hek <dig> and tuhr14tkb cell lines . tuhr14tkb's nfi-dna complexes migrated differently than those of the other cell lines . fabp <dig> expression  correlated with fabp <dig> promoter activation   and nfi gel shift patterns .

the nfi transcription factor family includes four genes: nfia, nfib, nfic and nfix  <cit> . in an effort to determine which nfi family member or members might interact with the fabp <dig> promoter, we determined nfi family members' mrna levels. nfia and nfic mrna levels were, respectively, weaker and stronger in all six rcc cell lines than in hek <dig> . nfib and nfix mrna levels were approximately the same in all seven cell lines .

when dp was subjected to gel shift analysis, only one weak band was observed . this band did not compete with any of the oligonucleotides representing transcription factor binding sites, whereas addition of excess amounts of c/ebp-β probe shifted the band up . in contrast, addition of yy <dig> antibody did not alter this band's mobility .

discussion
approximately 70% of rcc patients survive for  <dig> years. however, the presence of distant metastases dramatically lowers survival, indicating the importance of developing better biomarkers for predicting disease course and designing suitable therapies. overexpression of fabp <dig> in tumor tissue and urine of patients with rcc,  <cit>  led us to consider fabp <dig> as such a biomarker and to elucidate the regulation of its expression.

as an initial approach, we chose to study fabp <dig> expression in cell lines derived from human rccs and embryonic kidney. our finding of strong fabp <dig> mrna expression by two of six rcc cell lines  varies from our previous finding of 80%  overexpression by carcinoma compared to corresponding expression in normal tissues  <cit> . seliger et al. conducted studies related to ours that demonstrated fabp <dig> transcripts in  <dig> of  <dig> clear cell-type rcc lesions but only  <dig> of  <dig> rcc cell lines  <cit> . these observations may reflect the fact that higher grade  versus lower grade  tumors expressed significantly lower fabp <dig> mrna levels  <cit> . furthermore, achn and caki- <dig> cell line, which expressed fabp <dig> mrna weaker than other , isolated from malignant pleural effusion and cutaneous metastasis each  <cit> . and fabp <dig> mrna expression of 786-o cell lines was weaker than that of 769-p cell lines . that rcc cases with poorer prognoses tend to express lower fabp <dig> levels, is consistent with the fact that the 786-o cell line was isolated from a patient with a prognosis less favorable than the patient from which the 769-p cell line was derived  <cit> . several parallel studies have been conducted using other tumors. for example, primary versus metastatic melanomas express higher fabp <dig> mrna levels  <cit> . fabp7-positive, compared to fabp7-negative, breast cancer patients experienced significantly longer disease-free survival and breast cancer specific survival  <cit> . the role of fabp <dig> as a tumor suppressor in human mammary cells is suggested by the demonstration that its enforced overexpression inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation  <cit> . in contrast, a recent study showed that down-regulating fabp <dig> using rna interference techniques inhibited cell proliferation and migration but did not affect the invasive properties of the caki- <dig> rcc cell line  <cit> . this suggests that the role of fabp <dig> in tumorigenesis depends on cell-specific regulatory factors.

we noted a discrepancy between endogenous fabp <dig> mrna expression and the activity of the fabp <dig> promoter in cell lines derived from rccs  and that of a human embryonic kidney cell line  . these results are reminiscent of the report demonstrating that neither nfic nor nfix overexpression had any effect on endogenous fabp <dig> transcript levels although their overexpression decreased exogenous fabp <dig> promoter activity to 50%  <cit> .

a possible explanation for this discrepancy is the nucleosomal organization of a chromosomal versus an episomal promoter. the basic unit of chromatin is the nucleosomal core particle, containing  <dig> bp of dna that wraps twice around an octamer of core histones. the core histones bear a highly dynamic n-terminal amino acid tail approximately 20- <dig> residues long and rich in basic amino acids. these tails, which extend from the surface of the nucleosome, play an important role in folding of nucleosomal arrays into higher order chromatin structures that perform important functions in eukaryotic gene regulation  <cit> . methylation of promoter cpg islands can play important roles in gene silencing  <cit> . however, this mechanism does not likely apply to human fabp <dig>  since its promoter lacks a cpg island. we propose that an as-yet unidentified cis-acting negative regulatory element residing either farther upstream or downstream from the region we analyzed in this study may explain the discrepancy between fabp <dig> mrna levels and promoter activity.

gene expression can be negatively regulated post-transcriptionally by micrornas   <cit> , which play significant roles in cellular transformation and carcinogenesis by acting either as oncogenes or tumor suppressors  <cit> . a mechanism involving mirnas may explain the discrepancy between fabp <dig> mrna and protein expression levels.

bisgrove et al.  <cit>  reported that nfi is a key transcriptional activator of the fabp <dig> promoter in glioma cell lines. our fabp <dig> promoter analysis reported here also showed that deletion of the nfi binding site down-regulated promoter activity in the tuhr14tkb cell line , the only cell line positive for fabp <dig> protein expression. in glioma cell lines  <cit> , nfi-dna complexes were converted to a faster-migrating form by potato acid phosphatase treatment, indicating nfi activation by dephosphorylation  <cit> . our gel shift analysis also revealed a similar association between the presence of a faster-migrating band , fabp <dig> promoter activation , and fabp <dig> protein expression .

nfia and nfic were, respectively, weaker and stronger in all six rcc cell lines than in hek <dig> . in a glioma cell line, nfia and nfic sirnas inhibited and enhanced fabp <dig> promoter activity, respectively  <cit> , thus indicating that fabp <dig> promoter activity in rcc cell lines may be weaker than that in the hek <dig> cell line. this discrepancy might be attributed to a difference in fabp <dig> promoter regulation of nfia and nfic in rcc cell lines and glioma cell lines.

deletion of the mouse brn <dig> locus results in loss of specific neuronal lineages in the hypothalamus and consequent loss of the posterior pituitary gland  <cit> . a combination of three factors, ascl <dig>  brn <dig> and myt1l, suffice to rapidly and efficiently convert mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons in vitro  <cit> . brn <dig> may coordinate normal melanocytic differentiation, whereas brn <dig> can be re-activated in melanoma and may play a role in melanoma cell proliferation and tumorigenesis  <cit> . brn <dig> also plays an important role in keratinocyte differentiation and in the pathogenesis of lichen planus lesions  <cit> . our results indicate that brn <dig> represses the fabp <dig> promoter and suggests that regulation of fabp <dig> expression by brn <dig> differs between rccs and melanomas.

there is a contradiction between gel shift analysis by competing with oct <dig> or oct <dig> probe  and gel shift analysis adding anti-oct <dig> or anti-oct <dig> antibody . one probability is that oct <dig> and oct <dig> probes bind to other transcription factor. however, it might be rare case for one transcription factor to bind to fabp <dig> promoter, oct <dig> and oct <dig> probes. zwilling et al. reported that octl and oct <dig> interact with high mobility group protein  <dig>  <cit> . this indicates that high mobility group protein  <dig> may form complex with oct <dig> and oct <dig>  this putative complex may reflect band shift of upstream element competing with oct <dig> and oct <dig>  furthermore, oct <dig> and oct <dig> formed dimer on the consensus more  <cit> . same complex may form on upstream element of fabp <dig> promoter. forming oct1-oct <dig> complex might be disturbed in binding anti-oct <dig> and anti-oct <dig> antibodies to oct <dig> and oct <dig> respectively. other possibility is that anti-oct <dig> and anti-oct <dig> antibodies cannot bind to oct <dig> and oct <dig> in our gel shift condition.

our present finding that rcc cell lines differentially express fabp <dig> transcripts and protein, in contrast to the almost uniform overexpression of fabp <dig> transcripts by primary tumors, indicate the value of rcc cell lines for deciphering the mechanisms responsible for controlling fabp <dig> expression. our future studies will focus on analyses of additional rcc cell lines to determine whether the low frequency of fabp <dig> expression is a consequence of selecting tumor cells for in vitro growth, and if so, will provide new insights into regulation of fabp <dig> expression. it will be important to determine whether primary tumors express fabp <dig> at the same high level as its transcript. if so, this would provide compelling evidence for fabp7's etiological role in rcc, and encourage future studies to evaluate it as a diagnostic marker and as a therapeutic target.

CONCLUSIONS
a high percentage of primary rccs, but not rcc-derived cell lines, express high fabp <dig> mrna. the transcription factor brn <dig> binds to the cis-acting regions in the fabp <dig> promoter identified in the present studies. brn <dig> may repress the fabp <dig> promoter, because its expression inversely correlates with fabp <dig> promoter activity. nfi may also regulate fabp <dig> expression. future studies will focus on analyzing these and other regulatory molecules in order to help design new therapies for treating rcc.
