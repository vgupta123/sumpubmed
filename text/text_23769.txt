BACKGROUND
the 26s proteasome is an essential enzyme found in all eukaryotic cells  <cit>  consisting of a cylinder-shaped multimeric complex, the 20s proteasome core particle, capped at each end by another multimeric complex, the 19s regulatory unit. the atpase ring of the regulatory unit comprising six atpase subunits  associates directly with the 20s proteasome and is thought to play multiple roles within the complex  <cit> . the 20s proteasome degrades unfolded substrate proteins in an atp- and ubiquitin-independent manner  <cit> . it has been proposed that both unfolding and translocation of substrates are mediated by the six atpases  <cit> . crystallographic structural analysis shows that the ends of the 20s proteasome are in a closed state  <cit> . it has also been postulated that the atpases can open the proteasome channel leading to the proteolytic chamber within the 20s proteasome  <cit> . the 20s proteasome functions as the catalytic center of the 26s proteasome that can cleave peptides on the carboxyl side of hydrophobic, basic, and acidic amino acids in vitro that have been designated as chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like, and pgph activities, respectively  <cit> .

the entrance to the 20s proteasome cavity is closed  <cit> . the n-terminal tails of the different α-subunits adopt different conformations in the closed state and point inwards to block access through the proteasome channel  <cit> . due to the narrow entrance of the 20s proteasome, access is restricted. it is thought that channel gating is regulated by the atpase subunits in the 19s regulatory unit  <cit> . little is known about this process in eukaryotic proteasomes. the closed channel of the eukaryotic 20s proteasome can be stimulated by a variety of means; one of which is mild chemical treatment, such as the exposure to low concentrations of sds  <cit> . the stimulation may reflect opening of the proteasome channel that allows greater access of protein substrates to the proteolytic chamber. the n-terminal segments of various α-subunits that seal the central channel are generally rearranged to yield the activated form  <cit> .

the rpt6- <dig> saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant is temperature-sensitive for growth, being able to grow at 25°c but not at 37°c with cell division arrested in g2/metaphase  <cit> . normally, traffic through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is greatly increased in cells at an elevated temperature due to the abundance of misfolded or partially denatured protein substrates that must be removed. the defective proteasome in the rpt6- <dig> mutant is unable to process the increased protein traffic properly and cells eventually die due to the deleterious effects of accumulated misfolded proteins  <cit> .

the rpt6- <dig> deletion mutant has been used previously  <cit> . in this study, we isolated the 20s proteasome from the rpt6- <dig> mutant and compared its peptidase activities to those of the wild-type strain. surprisingly, distinct changes in peptidase activities and in subunit composition were observed in the 20s proteasome. a detailed comparative analysis using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry was then undertaken to investigate the molecular mechanism responsible for the observed changes.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
the purified 20s proteasome was subjected to two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis as described in horiguchi et al.  <cit> . the purified 20s proteasome  from each strain was mixed with  <dig> μl of ief sample buffer containing  <dig> m urea, 2% nonidet p- <dig>  5% mercaptoethanol, and  <dig> % pharmalyte  and applied to ipg drystrip . after rehydration for > <dig> h at room temperature, ief was conducted in gradient mode for  <dig> min. at 0– <dig> v ,  <dig> h at  <dig> v ,  <dig> h at 500– <dig> v  followed by  <dig> h at  <dig> v  at 15°c on a multiphor ii flat bed electrophoresis unit . after ief separation, the gel strips were equilibrated for  <dig> min in equilibration buffer a containing  <dig> mm tris-hcl, ph  <dig> ,  <dig> m urea, 30% glycerol, 1% sds, and  <dig> % dtt followed by equilibration buffer b for  <dig> min where dtt was replaced by  <dig> % iodoacetamide. the second dimension of separation was carried out in sds polyacrylamide vertical slab gels with 12% separating and 4% stacking gels and a constant current of  <dig> ma/gel. after electrophoresis, proteins were visualized by coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig> staining and all visible spots were selected for in-gel digestion.

in-gel digestion

RESULTS
assay of 20s proteasome activity and activation profile
the comparative study of the 20s proteasome purified from the rpt6- <dig> mutant to that of the wild-type strain was carried out using enzymatic and proteomic approaches. in yeast, the 20s proteasome is auto-inhibited by the n-terminal segments of α-subunits in the center of the heptameric α-ring. the 20s proteasome is usually purified in a latent state having low levels of peptidase activities  <cit>  that can be subsequently activated by a mild chaotropic agent, such as sds or linolenic acid  <cit> . these agents selectively denature the n-terminal region and open the α-channel of the 20s proteasome cavity  <cit> . by use of an enzymatic approach, peptidase activities of the 20s proteasome purified from the rpt6- <dig> mutant  and activation profiles were compared to those of the wild-type strain towards three peptidyl substrates; suc-llvy-mca for chymotrypsin-like activity , z-lle-mca for pgph activity , and boc-lrr-mca for trypsin-like activity . relative to the 20s proteasome purified from the wild-type strain , 20sr proteasome exhibited weak peptidase activities in the absence of sds . optimal activities were found at  <dig> % sds in both yeast strains as reported by others  <cit>  and that seemed to reflect a convergence . the sds appeared to inactivate lrr-activity as previously found by thomas et al.   <cit> . trypsin-like activity and its sds-mediated profile in the 20sr proteasome was evaluated using the peptidyl substrate boc-lrr-mca even though this type of peptidase is inactivated by sds. in the absence of sds, the 20sr proteasome hydrolyzed less peptidyl substrate than the 20sw proteasome, but both were almost equally active in its presence. this result suggests that the entrance of the α-channel in the 20sr proteasome is too narrow to allow passage of a peptidyl substrate to the catalytic chamber.

the polyunsaturated fatty acid, linolenic acid, is another well-known activator of the 20s proteasome  <cit>  and its effect on hydrolysis of peptidyl substrates was also evaluated . the obtained results were consistent with those of the sds-mediated activation profile excluding optimal activity, i.e., the activities of the 20sr proteasome in the absence of linolenic acid were very low, but optimal activities were not found to converge with those of the 20sw proteasome, suggesting that the 20sr proteasome was unable to be fully stimulated by either linolenic acid or the experimental conditions. our findings are similar to those of thomas et al.  <cit>  who reported linolenic acid-mediated stimulation of llvy-activity and lle-activity of the 20s proteasome from ostrich skeletal muscle at ph  <dig> , and inactivation of lrr-activity by the same acid. however, the linolenic acid-mediated optimal activities were found at ~ <dig> μg/ml linolenic acid in both strains under the experimental conditions. this result distinguished the 20sr proteasome from the 20sw proteasome. moreover, the same activity assay described above was carried out at 25°c under the same conditions in order to evaluate whether the low level of activities of the 20sr proteasome were altered by assay temperature. no significant changes of activities or activation profiles were detected . this result was consistent with the possibility of a gating defect in the 20sr proteasome channel.

effect of reaction ph on peptidase activities of the 20s proteasome
in order to obtain clearer evidence for weak activity of the 20sr proteasome, we examined the effect of reaction ph on the peptide-hydrolyzing activities. no significant changes were found for 20sr proteasome activities over a wide range of ph values . these results suggested that subunit composition of the 20sr proteasome might be related to the low activities. the llvy- and lle-activities of the 20s proteasome in both strains exhibited maximum values at neutral or weakly alkaline ph, whereas lrr-activities exhibited a maximum at alkaline ph. this observation is similar to the findings of yanagawa et al.  <cit>  who conducted a comparative study of the effect of reaction ph on three peptidase activities of the 20s proteasome from rice and spinach. based on the low level of activities and the activation profiles, we concluded that the 20s proteasome in rpt6- <dig> likely had a gating defect.

subunit compositional analysis of the 20s proteasome by one-dimensional electrophoresis
hoffman et al.  <cit>  identified two electrophoretic forms of the 20s proteasome from rabbit reticulocytes, a slow form  and a fast form , and demonstrated the latter to be less active in the hydrolysis of the fluorogenic peptide suc-llvy-mca. in this report, we conducted a comparative analysis of the migration of the intact 20s proteasome and its subunits by one-dimensional electrophoresis  to determine whether the low activity of the 20sr proteasome was related to its mobility. our data clearly demonstrated a distinct band in the nondenaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel without a significant change in mobility . but in sds-page, the banding pattern of the 20sr proteasome differed from that of the 20sw proteasome , suggesting that changes in the subunits in the 20sr proteasome were responsible for the low peptidase activities.

proteomic analysis and identification of subunits by mass spectrometry
to test whether the observed low levels of activities of the 20sr proteasome were a consequence of the changes in subunit, we attempted to analyze each subunit in detail by two-dimensional electrophoresis  followed by the sequence analysis of individual subunits extracted from the 2-d gel. the 2-de revealed substantial similarities in spotting patterns of subunits of the 20sr proteasome to that of the wild-type with the exception of two spots . all spots of the 20s proteasome separated by 2-de were identified by maldi-tof-ms . among the fourteen subunits of the 20s proteasome, only the β <dig> subunit could not be identified due to insufficient protein on the gel. two α-subunits  in rpt6- <dig> were found to differ from their wild-type counterparts in spotting pattern in both pi and molecular weight . representative pmf maps of the α1- and α7-subunits of both strains are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. in rpt6- <dig>  the α1-subunit shifted slightly and the α7-subunit shifted markedly towards the acidic side of the gel, while both migrated slowly in sds-page  indicating that the weak activities of the 20sr proteasome are a consequence of changes in these two α-subunits. at least two explanations can be offered to account for the lower activity of the 20s proteasome in the rpt6- <dig> mutant. one, the rpt6- <dig> mutation caused changes in the α-subunits of the 20s proteasome by interfering with assembly of the 26s proteasome. two, stress caused by the rpt6- <dig> mutation induced subsequent compensatory changes in the subunits.

coverage
the top blast hit for each spot, its accession number, and sequence coverage to the s. cerevisiae proteasomal subunit are shown. the peptide mass fingerprinting was performed using the protein spots from the wild-type strain as shown in figure  <dig>  the differentially spotted proteins were identified in both strains.

groll et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the channel of the 20s proteasome is too narrow for substrate entry, but that the proteasome may become active when the channel is open. as shown in their study, activity of the 20s proteasome is controlled by the α-channel. here, we identified two high molecular weight forms of the α-subunits in rpt6- <dig> that resulted in weak 20sr proteasome activity. we speculate that the α-subunit are differentially modified in the 20sr proteasome and block the gated channel that allows restricted entry of substrate into the proteasome catalytic cavity since the substrate specific activities in the absence of sds were low, but optimal activities in the presence of sds were found to converge with those of the 20sw proteasome .

to reconfirm the results described above, we characterized the differentially migrated subunits in the 20sr proteasome by western blotting. the results reconfirmed the slow migration of α <dig> and α <dig> in the 20sr proteasome compared to those of the 20sw proteasome . phosphorylation of the proteasome has been reported to modulate a number of functions including catalytic activity  <cit> . iwafune et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that the α7-subunit in yeast is a major phosphorylatable subunit. regulation of the proteasome complex by phosphorylation of the α7-subunit in cos- <dig> cells has been demonstrated by rivett and colleagues  <cit> . tokumoto et al.  <cit>  detected a high molecular weight phosphorylated α4-subunit in the 26s proteasome from immature xenopus oocyte. these findings led us to test whether the differentially migrating α-subunits in rpt6- <dig> were phosphorylated. no significant change in mobility or intensity was detected for α <dig> treated with alkaline phosphatase  or for the similarly treated α1-subunit .

the rpt6- <dig> mutant arrests cell division within one cycle at the restrictive temperature  <cit>  and under normal growth conditions, we found changes in the α1- and α7-subunits of the 20s proteasome in the rpt6- <dig> mutant. one question that remains to be clarified is whether the observed changes are affected at the restrictive temperature. the data presented in figure  <dig> indicate that the change in α <dig> in the rpt6- <dig> mutant grown at 25°c disappeared during the response to cell stress. interestingly, in parallel with the disappearance, normalization of llvy-hydrolyzing activity was observed in the absence of sds . one likely explanation of the data presented here is that the α1- and α7-subunits exist in the 20sr proteasome in an immature form that result in a gating defect in the proteasome channel. a qualitative change to these subunits occurred at 37°c to cause them to mature because under stressful conditions, the cell is in greatest need of optimal proteasome function. alternatively, newly synthesized proteasomes in the rpt6- <dig> mutant may be refractory to modification due to excessive stress at the restrictive temperature.

aexponentially-growing cells at 25°c were shifted to 37°c and incubated for  <dig> h. activity assays were carried out with the active q-sepharose fractions from both strains containing equal amounts of proteasome as described in the methods using suc-llvy-mca as a substrate in the presence  and absence of sds. the values are means ± sd of three independent experiments.

although the purified proteasomes from both strains produced single bands in nondenaturing-page , they differed in composition in 2-de . one possibility is that the compositional differences reflect differences in co-purified proteasome-interacting proteins . five proteins  found with the 20s proteasome were also identified by database searching . the protein, p <dig> was found in the wild-type strain but not in the rpt6- <dig> mutant. therefore, we cannot rule out the possibility that the pip, p <dig>  plays a supplementary role in normal 20s proteasome function in yeast.

to show that the changes found in the 20sr proteasome were dependent on the rpt6- <dig> mutation, the rpt6- <dig> strain was transformed with the wild-type allele as described in methods. the rpt <dig> allele was found to complement the temperature sensitivity of the mutant. the 20s proteasome purified from the transformant was analyzed to examine whether changes in the α-subunits and the weak peptidase activities were eliminated. interestingly, the banding pattern of the 20s proteasome subunits of the transformant was found to be similar to that of wild-type by sds-page analysis using a 12% polyacrylamide gel. further, the slow mobility of the α-subunits and the weak peptidase activities were rescued in the transformant as well .

CONCLUSIONS
the 20s proteasome purified from the rpt6- <dig> mutant exhibited low levels of peptidase activities compared to the wild-type strain. the activator-mediated activation profile of the 20s proteasome from rpt6- <dig> also differed from that observed in the wild-type 20s proteasome. the α1- and α7-subunits of the 20s proteasome in the rpt6- <dig> mutant were found to differ from their wild-type counterparts.
