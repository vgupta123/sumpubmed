BACKGROUND
coffee is one of the most valuable primary products in world trade, and its cultivation, processing, transportation and marketing provide employment for around  <dig> million people worldwide  <cit> . furthermore, this culture is crucial to the economies of many developing countries, and its international trade reaches up to us$ <dig> billion per year  <cit> . world coffee production is around  <dig> million metric tons, and brazil is the leading producer  <cit> .

coffea arabica is the main cultivated coffee species  worldwide  <cit> , and its production is commonly affected by different insect-pests. among these pests, the most damaging is the coffee berry borer , hypothenemus hampei  . cbb attacks and feeds on coffee berries, decreasing the quality and the flavour of the grain coffee and causing world-wide monetary losses of around us$ <dig> million annually  <cit> . a major part of the insect life cycle is spent inside the coffee beans, making control very difficult  <cit> . current methods used to control cbb are based on cultural, biological and predominantly chemical approaches. the use of the insecticide endosulfan is very widespread; however, cbb with high levels of resistance to endosulfan have already been detected and reported in new caledonia  <cit> . in addition, of the  <dig> species in genus coffea described, none have shown any natural resistance against cbb  <cit> , making it unlikely that control of this insect can be achieved by plant breeding alone.

biotechnology may be a promising alternative for h. hampei control. several genes are potentially available for this purpose, including bt toxins, digestive enzyme inhibitors, chitinases and lectins  <cit> . with respect to the enzyme inhibitor class, the expression of alpha-amylase inhibitors  from both scarlet runner bean  and common bean  has been shown to be effective in transgenic plants, showing high protection against seed weevils in pea  <cit> , azuki bean  <cit> , chickpea  <cit> , and cowpea  <cit> . with pea, complete protection against the pea weevil bruchus pisorum was shown under field conditions  <cit> . in all of these experiments, expression of the α-ai coding region was driven by the seed-specific promoter of p. vulgaris phytohemagglutinin. interestingly, both amylase inhibitors, α-ai <dig> from p. vulgaris and α-ai1-like amylase inhibitor from wild accessions of scarlet runner bean have shown to inhibit the α-amylases from h. hampei  <cit> .

here we describe the introduction of an expression cassette carrying the α-ai <dig> gene under phytohemagglutinin seed-specific promoter control in c. arabica plants using biolistics, followed by regeneration of coffee plants.  according to the molecular characterisation and in vitro assays, extracts from the transgenic plants with a relatively high level of expressed α-ai <dig> protein are active against coffee berry borer α-amylases, indicating that this transformation event with α-ai <dig> represents a promising method that can be applied to the control of cbb.

RESULTS
transformation of c. arabica plants
c. arabica plants were transformed using particle bombardment with vector pbin19α-ai <dig>  after  <dig> months of in vitro culture and selection of bombarded c. arabica calli had been bombarded ,  <dig> plantlets were obtained. all displayed normal subsequent development . six positive plants for α-ai <dig> gene were maintained in the greenhouse  and after two years the first flowers appeared, followed by fruit development , like occurs in non transformed coffee plants. out of the six plants, three were not able to produce fruits after three years of greenhouse cultivation. sterility in transgenic plants may be caused by somaclonal variation, generated as a result of tissue culture or caused by the position of the transgene in the genome. similar observations were found in other transgenic plants such as soybean and rice  <cit> .

transgenic seeds of t <dig> plants numbered  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were collected and used for molecular characterisation, an in vitro inhibitory assay, and the production of t <dig> plants from plants  <dig> and  <dig>  the coffee beans showed a normal level of germination, ranging from 40%  to 70% , in agreement with the data shown by valio  <cit> , which indicates that the expression of α-ai <dig> did not interfere with germination and seedling growth . the genomic dna from all eleven germinated t <dig> plants was evaluated using pcr.

molecular characterisation of the transformed plants
six pcr positive coffee plants  were obtained after biolistic transformation, showing the presence of both nptii and α-ai <dig> genes . the transformation efficiency obtained in this work was  <dig> % . although generation of spontaneous kanamycin resistance is very well documented  <cit> , the low efficiency may also be a consequence of unstable genome insertion.

the stable integration of the α-ai <dig> gene into the coffee genome was confirmed by southern blot analysis. the α-ai <dig> probe successfully hybridised with genomic dna samples from the six positive t <dig> plants, confirming the pcr results .

as for the t <dig> plants obtained from seeds of the primary transgenic coffee plants , eleven individuals were obtained and evaluated by pcr. all of them  were positive for the nptii and α-ai <dig> genes in these experiments , indicating that the genes were transferred by inheritance in transgenic c. arabica. normally, a classic proportion of three transgenic plants for one non-transgenic plant  is expected for c. arabica because it is an allotetraploid crop presenting a regular bivalent pairing of homologous chromosomes  <cit> . in our results we did not observe a 3: <dig> proportion, possibly due to the low number of t <dig> individuals analysed. alternatively, this proportion of positive t <dig> plants could be generated by a t <dig> plant with more than one insertion.

analysis of expressed α-ai <dig> in transgenic coffee seeds
to examine α-ai <dig> protein expression in coffee beans of t <dig> plants, crude extracts from transformed seeds were analysed using sds-page and immunoblots . the level of expression was evaluated by elisa assay . the immunoblot showed three positive bands of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> kda that were not present in the extracts of untransformed plants and corresponded to the protein found in p. vulgaris seed extracts . in the common bean, amylase inhibitor- <dig> is synthesised as a preproprotein, and in its mature form, it consists of two polypeptides of  <dig> and  <dig> kda  <cit> . differential processing of the polypeptide and glycan portions of the protein results in a series of bands on immunoblots, especially in transgenic seeds of different species where processing events may be different. for example, as many as  <dig> different immunoreactive polypeptides were found in tobacco seeds  <cit> . in transgenic peas expressing α-ai <dig>  three polypeptides were visualised on immunoblots  <cit> . the altered molecular mass of α-ai <dig> in the different transgenic plants may have occured due to a variation in the extent of glycosylation or the processing of the glycans  <cit> . even in p. vulgaris seeds, the subunits α and β of α-ai <dig> are not always glycosylated in the same way, generating polypeptide heterogeneity  <cit> . unexpectedly, differences in glycosylation between the inhibitor isolated from the common bean and from transgenic peas expressing α-ai <dig> resulted in differences in immunogenic properties between the two proteins. the protein made in peas caused immunological responses and inflammation in mice  <cit> . nevertheless, no difference in immunogenicity was observed in mice fed with transgenic chickpeas expressing α-ai <dig>  <cit> . as a consequence, it is difficult to predict if similar immunogenic alterations will occur in an inhibitor made by transgenic coffee plants.

one unit of h. hampei α-amylase activity was utilised in the inhibition assay.

using elisa assays, we detected different levels of recombinantly expressed α-ai <dig> in the different transformed plants . the highest level was found in plant  <dig> , in which α-ai <dig> comprised  <dig> % of the total seed protein extract. these variable protein concentration levels in transgenic plants may be explained by several factors, such as somaclonal variation  <cit> , mutations in the inserted gene  <cit> , genetic alterations caused by tissue culture  <cit> , different copy numbers of the inserted transgene  <cit> , or by the position of the transgene inside the plant genome  <cit> . in transgenic chickpeas and peas seeds, higher α-ai <dig> expression levels were observed:  <dig> - <dig> % in peas  <cit>  and  <dig> % in chickpea  <cit>  or  <dig> % in chickpea  <cit> .

the phytohemagglutinin  promoter used in this work was cloned from the p. vulgaris genome and first analysed in tobacco. the promoter showed similar seed-specific expression, in both,  tobacco and beans   <cit> . it is important to emphasise the α-ai <dig> coffee seed-specific expression driven by this promoter, as it decreases the chance of affecting non-target insects. because pollinators can increase coffee yields by  <dig> % and decrease the frequency of pea berries by 27%, the protection of non-target insects is fundamental for coffee crop production  <cit> .

inhibition of h. hampei α-amylases by α-ai <dig> expressed in transgenic coffee seeds
in vivo insect assays described in other works exhibited mortality ranging from  <dig> % to 100%  <cit> , depending on the inhibitor concentration in each tested plant. the high levels of amylase inhibitor may be related to the fact that in some studies  <cit> , seeds from homozygous plants were used. however, the coffee plants used here were hemizygous. valencia et al.  showed that an inhibitor from common bean inhibits the h. hampei gut amylases up to 95%. we tested the effect of extracts from transformed seeds, and the level of inhibition of amylase activity correlates with the level of inhibitor in the common bean  seeds . the plant with the highest amount of α-ai <dig> inhibitor  exhibited the strongest h. hampei α-amylases inhibition, and the inhibition levels reached by each transgenic plant were directly related to the α-ai <dig> concentration .

CONCLUSIONS
the data presented here lead to several important conclusions. from pcr and southern blot analysis, it was possible to conclude that the α-ai <dig> gene, fused under control of the phytohemagglutinin promoter and terminator, was inserted into the c. arabica genome. both the α-ai <dig> expression and inhibitor activity were confirmed in coffee seeds. additional tests will be necessary not only to confirm the in vivo efficiency of these transgenic plants against h. hampei, but also to analyse the inheritance of the inserted genes through different generations until attainment of a fully homozygous progeny . moreover, the presence of nptii will be evaluated to identify if this gene was inserted in any other locus in the genome, allowing its separation from α-ai <dig> through conventional breeding. finally, considering the long life cycle of the coffee plant, we consider these transformation events a crucial step that might control h. hampei, the main insect pest in coffee.
