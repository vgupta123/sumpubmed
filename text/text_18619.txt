BACKGROUND
there has been considerable focus in human genetics on characterizing rare variation in the human population, and the role these variants play in human diseases to account for the “missing heritability” in genome-wide association studies using common variants  <cit> . until recently, the discovery of genetic variants was the rate-limiting step due to the prohibitive cost of sequencing large numbers of samples using traditional sanger sequencing. over the past five years, next generation sequencing  technologies have replaced traditional sanger sequencing as the predominant method of dna sequencing  <cit> . the main advantage of ngs over traditional sanger sequencing is its cheaper cost and higher throughput. ngs has had a profound impact on the field of human genetics because it is now possible to sequence large numbers of individuals to fully describe the spectrum of human genetic variation, from common to rare variation  <cit> . in parallel to the developments of new sequencing technologies, improved methods have been developed to enrich specific subsets of the genome for next generation sequencing. while commonly referred to as exome sequencing, because in many cases protein coding regions have been enriched, in fact any portion of the genome can be chosen for target enrichment  <cit> . capture sequencing allows many individuals to be sequenced for particular regions of interest, as opposed to whole genome sequencing a smaller number samples at the same cost  <cit> . this also provides greater sensitivity for snp detection compared to whole genome sequencing  <cit> . exome capture sequencing has yielded many successful examples for uncovering causative mutations in mendelian disease  <cit> , and describing the full extent of rare variation in protein-coding portions of the genome that whole genome sequencing may have missed because high-coverage, whole genome sequencing is still not common practice  <cit> .

while the discovery of genetic variation is no longer a rate-limiting step for human genetic analysis, the application of ngs and sequence capture technologies can be limited by the amount of dna available  <cit> . in particular, probands that have been collected for a clinical study maybe difficult to sample again. previously collected dna samples gradually decay in quality over time, and non-invasive collection techniques, such as buccal swabs, may result in insufficient amounts of dna  <cit> . several rounds of ngs or capture array sequencing may deplete original stock aliquots of samples. whole genome amplification  is a method to overcome such challenges, and can yield micrograms of wga dna from nanogram starting amounts of template.

previous studies have shown that wga dna performs well on high-density snp genotyping arrays  <cit> . three recent studies have investigated the use of wga dna in ngs. murphy et. al.  <cit>  investigated the use of a wga protocol performed in situ on laser capture micro-dissection cancer cells for the discovery of structural variants in a tumor genome using illumina mate-pair sequencing. tao et. al.  <cit>  showed that wga dna has favorable sequence capture metrics when comparing to genomic dna when adapting the nimblegen capture array for use on the illumina ga sequencing platform. el sharawy et. al.  <cit>  investigated the use of wga dna in a ngs microdroplet-based pcr sample enrichment pipeline experiment of  <dig> exons with  <dig> hapmap samples. they showed there was strong genotype concordance with both genomic and wga dna snp calls to hapmap iii genotypes. in this paper we describe the results of variant calls using wga dna for a single sample for two separate capture sequencing experiments on the agilent sureselect platform, and compare them to variant calls made with genomic dna for the same samples. while the results in this study are based on a limited number of samples, our results suggest that wga samples have a high sensitivity in detecting variant alleles identified with genomic dna, and can be used effectively in re-sequencing studies.

RESULTS
capture metrics of wga and genomic dna
we analyzed capture sequencing metrics of genomic and wga sample pairs for two capture experiments, a chr <dig> custom array and a whole exome capture array. additional file  <dig> contains capture metrics from the program calculatehsmetrics from the software package picard  <cit> . the average target coverage for the whole exome capture experiments were 92x  and 80x . the average target coverage for the chr <dig> capture experiments were 432x  and 224x . wga samples in both capture experiments had a higher number of pf  reads thus higher average target because they were sequenced in a separate flow-cell lane, while the genomic dna samples were multiplexed. for both sequencing experiments a large percentage of reads were marked as duplicates, as the percentage of usable bases on target for each of the capture experiments does not exceed 40%. despite the high duplicate read fraction both samples in the whole exome capture experiment had 80% targeted of bases with at least 20x coverage. for the smaller chr <dig> capture experiment, over 90% of targeted bases had at least 20x coverage.

since the wga capture experiments had a larger sequencing library compared to the genomic, a random subset of reads were selected from the starting fastq files to match the number of pf reads of the genomic sequencing library . the average target coverage for the chr <dig> wga subsetted bam  is higher than the chr <dig> genomic experiment, even though the starting number of pf reads is the same. this can be attributed to higher percentage of usable bases on target, as calculated with hsmetrics. similarly, the whole-exome wga subsetted bam average target coverage  is less than the genomic sample, despite starting with the same number of pf reads. the percent usable bases on target are lower in the whole-exome wga subset than the whole exome genomic sequencing experiment.

next, we explored the relationship between gc% and median target coverage for both capture experiments. previous studies have shown that lower sequencing coverage occurs in regions with high gc%  <cit> . gc% of targets for each capture experiment was calculated. next, the targets were placed in four bins according to the first, median, and third quartiles of capture target gc%, based on the boxplots shown in additional file 2: figure s <dig>  in addition to boxplots of gc% of capture targets of the two experiments, additional file 2: figure s <dig> shows the gc% of the whole genome and chr <dig> for comparison. targets were placed in the appropriate bin and within each bin, a box plot of median target coverage was made for genomic and wga dna, as shown in figure  <dig>  the results show that for genomic dna, chr <dig> capture targets in the fourth bin  have lower coverage than targets in the other three bins. for the corresponding wga dna, targets in the first  and fourth bins have a similar distribution of median target coverage. whole exome capture targets in the fourth bin  had lower amounts of coverage than targets with lower gc% for both genomic and wga samples. since the chr <dig> capture targets were over a much smaller interval , its harder to make any definitive statement regarding gc% and lower sequencing coverage, but the patterns of coverage seen in both capture experiments examined here are in line with previous studies  <cit> .

overall variant counts and venn analysis
table  <dig> shows the counts and callset metrics of the individual snp and indel callsets, after post-call filtering . for all snp callsets the dbsnp fraction is 98%. the overall transition-transversion  ratio for the wga and genomic chr <dig> callsets are  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively. the overall tstv ratio for the wga and genomic whole-exome callsets are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. the tstv values of novel snps found in each of the capture experiments is considerably reduced, suggesting these may be false positive calls.

read coverages, snp and indel summaries.

we performed venn analysis of the wga and genomic callsets to see how variants overlapped based on coordinate intersection. figure  <dig> shows four venn diagrams for snp and indel sites in each of the capture experiments. visual inspection indicates there is a high fraction of site-level concordance of snp calls, with 97% and 99% of the union of snp sites lying in the intersection for the whole exome and chr <dig> capture callsets. slightly lower numbers of 87% and 90% were found for indel sites. overall tstv ratios for snps in the intersection were similar to those calculated for each individual callset. tstv ratios of novel sites were slightly higher in the intersection, when compared to the original callsets. the tstv values of the genomic and wga unique fractions for the whole-exome capture experiment are considerably lower, suggesting these are lower quality calls. the unique fractions of the chr <dig> capture experiment are much smaller, making it difficult to interpret the differences in value of their tstv ratios.

downsampling alignments and subsetting reads
since the wga samples were run as a single lane but the genomic samples were multiplexed, we downsampled reads from each bam to examine the effect of coverage on the numbers of discovered variants. a total of  <dig> bootstrap sub-samples of reads were performed . in addition to downsampling the reads from the aligned bam file, a subset of fastq reads were chosen at random to match the starting number pf reads in the genomic library for both experiments .

figure  <dig> shows the median number of variants discovered as a function of average target coverage for snps and indels, for each capture experiment. the randomly chosen subset of wga reads to match the number of pf reads in the genomic sequencing experiment is shown as genomic.matched on the x-axis, and sorted in ascending order of target coverage. as expected, downsampling bams reduces the number of called variants, with the original wga bam having the largest number of called variants. the datapoint that most closely matches the target coverage of the non-wga sample is 80x for the whole-exome plot. the median number of snps and indels found  closely match the numbers of variants found the in genomic derived variant calls listed in table  <dig>  the datapoint that most closely matches the target coverage non-wga sample is 200x for the chr <dig> plot. the median number of snps and indels found , again closely match what was found in the genomic derived calls listed in table  <dig> 

genotype concordance
we used two measures of genotype concordance, non-reference sensitivity  and non-reference discrepancy   <cit> , shown in additional file 3: figure s <dig>  to compare genotypes made with wga and genomic dna. nrs measures the proportion of sites called variant in the comparison callset  that are also called variant in the evaluation callset . nrd measures the proportion of differing genotypes between the wga and genomic callsets, at sites called in both data sets, excluding concordant homozygous reference calls.

the nrs and nrd values for snps and indels for each capture experiment are shown in table  <dig> and the concordance matrices from which they were calculated are shown in additional file 4: figure s <dig>  for the chr <dig> capture experiment, of the  <dig> sites that contribute to the decrease in snp nrs of the wga call set, six are heterozygous sites in the genomic dna that were not called in wga dna. of the  <dig> sites contributing to the decrease in indel nrs,  <dig> were heterozygous genotypes in genomic dna, that were evenly split as homozygous reference or no calls in wga dna. for the  <dig> sites contributing snp nrd, eight were wga heterozygous sites, called homozygous non-reference in genomic dna. the greatest contribution to indel nrd came from sites that were called heterozygous in wga dna, but homozygous reference in genomic dna.

next, genotype concordance for each bootstrap downsampled chr <dig> capture bam was calculated by comparing its calls to the ones made from the original genomic bam file. nrs and nrd values were summarized by calculating their median value across all  <dig> downsampled bams. in addition, nrs and nrd of the subsetted wga bam was calculated by comparing its genotypes to the original genomic bam. figure  <dig> shows the affect of downsampling and subsetting on genotype concordance metrics. unexpectedly, two of the three downsampled datasets have slightly higher snp and indel nrs values than the original wga callset. this includes the nrs of the 200x downsampled bam, which most closely matches the coverage of the genomic sample. similarly, the original wga callset has a higher nrd values than some of the lower coverage, downsampled bams . the indel nrd for the genomic matched wga bam is clearly an outlier on the graph. this might be attributed to sampling error, but since the wga fastq files were subsetted only once, its difficult to say. this unexpected pattern can potentially be attributed to the smaller capture interval in the chr <dig> experiment and the fewer numbers of variants called, as the relationship between concordance metrics and lower coverage, downsampled bams is clearer in the whole-exome capture experiment . also, since a technical replicate of genomic sequencing was not performed, it’s difficult to ascertain what the expected genotype discrepancies should be between genomic and wga derived variant calls.

the nrs and nrd values and the genotype concordance matrix from which they were calculated for the whole-exome capture experiment are also shown in table  <dig> and additional file 4: figure s <dig>  respectively. of the  <dig> sites that contribute to the decrease of snp nrs of the wga call set, the majority come from sites either called heterozygous or homozygous non-reference in genomic dna but were no calls in wga dna. the majority of sites contributing to the decrease of indel nrs come from sites called heterozygous in genomic dna, but called homozygous reference in wga dna. sites contributing most to snp nrd are heterozygous calls in genomic dna, called homozygous reference in wga dna, for both snp and indel variants. the concordance metrics of the wga whole exome downsampled bams to original genomic dna calls, also shown in figure  <dig>  reinforce the intuitive expectation that the lower coverage wga callsets result in higher nrd and lower nrs values. the one exception is the snp nrs of the genomic matched subsetted wga bam, which had a nrd value of 2%. this could be attributed to sampling error, since the subsetting was only performed once, and not multiple times like the downsampling. the snp and indel nrs of the downsampled 80x bams, which match the average coverage of the genomic bam, are only slightly lower than the original wga bam. also, the snp and indel nrd values are slightly higher than the original wga bam. still, in each comparison, the original wga call set had the lowest nrd and highest nrs values relative to lower coverage downsampled and subsetted callsets. as with the chr <dig> experiment, the genomic sequencing was not repeated, so it difficult to quantify the expected genotype discrepancies and sensitivity of the wga derived variant calls.

targets with higher amounts of gc% have lower amounts of median target coverage for both capture experiments and both types of dna, as described above. figure  <dig> shows nrs and nrd metrics for each bin, based on gc% of targets. for the original wga whole-exome callset, the greatest number of genotype discrepancies and lowest detection sensitivities, for both snp and indel variants, occur in targets with the highest gc%. the patterns are less clear for the original wga chr <dig> callset, again most likely attributable to the smaller size of capture region. for both snp and indel variants, the greatest numbers of genotype discrepancies are in targets with the highest gc%. the pattern is less clear for variant detection sensitivity, indels in target regions with the highest amount of gc% have the lowest sensitivity, but this is not true for snps.

allele bias in snp variant calls
to investigate whether there is any evidence of allele bias in snp variant calls, all calls from the original chr <dig> and whole-exome wga datasets were divided into four groups: concordant genotypes, unique genomic calls , discordant genotypes , and wga unique. in each group, the percentage of each six possible reference/alternate allele combinations was calculated. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  we tested to see if there were statistically different proportions of each reference/alternate allele combinations  between the four groups. the resulting p-values are in additional file  <dig>  for the whole-exome capture snps, there was a significant difference in proportion between concordant cg snps and each of the three other categories. also, there was a significant difference in proportion of gt snps between concordant and wga unique categories. for the chr <dig> capture set there was no significant difference in proportion of snps between any of the four categories for each of the  <dig> different allele combinations. the interpretation of the statistical analysis of allele bias must be tempered by the fact that the analysis is based on a small sample size of matched genomic / wga samples, lack of technical replicates, and the reduced target region for the chr <dig> capture experiment. but even with this in mind, results suggest that allele bias does not play a significant role in snp variant discovery with wga dna.

validation of snp variant calls
sequencing derived snp variant calls were validated by comparing genotypes to affymetrix  <dig>  human snp array genotypes for the same sample. the  <dig>  array has over  <dig>  variants covering the whole genome, hence only those array genotypes that overlapped a capture target interval were examined. for the whole-exome capture array there were a total of  <dig> overlapping snps and for the custom chr <dig> capture array there were a total of  <dig> overlapping snps. see the methods section for more details. the nrs and nrd metrics of the wga and genomic sequencing based snp genotypes when compared to affymetrix  <dig>  snp array genotypes for both capture experiments is shown in table  <dig>  the nrd for the wga whole-exome capture sequencing derived genotypes when compared to the snp array genotypes is  <dig> % and the nrs value is  <dig> %. the nrd for the genomic whole-exome capture sequencing derived genotypes when compared to the snp array genotypes is  <dig> % and the nrs value is  <dig> %.

nrs and nrd values for whole-exome and chr <dig> capture call sets when comparing to affymetrix  <dig>  genotypes.

the concordance matrix for the wga whole-exome comparison to capture array genotypes is shown in the top panel and the genomic concordance matrix is shown in the bottom panel in additional file 6: figure s <dig>  for sites that contribute to a decrease in whole-exome capture nrs, the read coverage and pileup of bases was investigated. for the  <dig> sites in the wga whole-exome capture call set that contribute to a decrease in nrs,  <dig> had minimal coverage and were called homozygous reference. the remaining sites have an overwhelming majority reads with mapping quality  <dig> spanning the snp position and were not called. similarly, for the  <dig> sites that contribute to the decrease in nrs in the genomic dna whole-exome capture derived genotypes,  <dig> had minimal coverage and were called homozygous reference. the remaining sites had reads spanning the snp position with mapping quality values of zero and not called. there are a total of  <dig> snp positions common to both wga and genomic callsets that contribute to a loss of nrs when comparing the affymetrix snp array genotypes.

the nrs and nrd values when comparing the wga, chr <dig> capture sequencing snp genotypes to the snp array genotypes are  <dig> % and  <dig> %. the nrs for the genomic dna, chr <dig> capture snp genotypes when compared to snp array genotypes is 83% and the nrd is  <dig> %. the concordance metrics for the chr <dig> custom array snp genotypes when compared to the snp array derived genotypes is shown in additional file 7: figure s <dig>  the top panel shows the concordance matrix for the wga chr <dig> capture array and in the bottom panel is the genomic chr <dig> concordance matrix. for both comparisons, the majority of sites that contribute to the loss of sensitivity in the sequencing derived snp calls are sites that were called heterozygote on the genotyping array. careful visual inspection and examination of read pileups in the wga and genomic bam files revealed no evidence of an alternate allele and hence were called homozygous reference. there are total of  <dig> snp position common to both wga and genomic call sets that contribute to a loss nrs when comparing to the affymetrix snp array genotypes.

allele bias in snp variant validation calls
to investigate if there were any biases in the comparisons of the sequencing derived genotypes to the affymetrix array based genotypes the percentage of each six possible reference/alternate allele combinations was calculated in sites that contributed to concordant, nrs, and nrd categories. the results are shown in figure  <dig>  to test if there were statistically different proportions of each reference/alternate allele combinations between groups we applied the same pairwise.fisher.test when comparing the wga derived snp calls to the genomic derived snp calls . the resulting p-values of the analysis are in additional file  <dig>  the only significant differences in proportion detected were at snps when comparing the chr <dig> genomic and whole exome capture calls to the corresponding affymetrix array derived genotypes.

CONCLUSIONS
the study described here provides an in-depth assessment of the suitability of wga dna for targeted resequencing and variant discovery using next generation sequencing. we evaluated whole exome as well as targeted genomic enrichment using agilent sureselect technology, and compared findings from wga samples to results obtained with genomic dna from the same individual, as well as validated a subset of snp variant calls with affymetrix snp array genotypes. overall, venn analysis showed that the numbers of snps and indels called in the whole exome and chr <dig> capture callsets using wga or genomic dna is very similar, with the vast majority of variant sites shared between datasets. the concordance metric nrs demonstrates that using wga dna has high sensitivity for snp sites with values of  <dig> % and  <dig> % for the whole exome and chr <dig> sequence capture callsets, respectively. the nrs for indels is lower at  <dig> % and  <dig> %. snp nrd values for the whole-exome and chr <dig> callset were both less than 1%, but were an order of magnitude higher for indel calls. the lower values of these metrics may be due to slight differences in alignment of reads between genomic and wga dna in regions that contain indel variants. the majority of discrepant genotypes between wga and genomic dna involve heterozygous genotypes and statistical analysis suggests that these are enriched for gc alleles, at least in the whole-exome capture data. validating a subset of the snp made with genomic and wga dna that overlap sites on the affymetrix  <dig>  snp array showed high sensitivity and high genotype accuracy for the whole exome capture callset. the sensitivity and genotype concordance numbers for the chr <dig> capture array were not as high, but the loss of sensitivity can be explained by lack of evidence of the alternate allele in the read pileup or poor zero mapping quality values spanning the snp position. downsampling and subsetting of reads to achieve lower coverage in wga callsets  consistently resulted in lower genotype concordance and sensitivity metrics for the whole exome capture experiment, in contrast to the chr <dig> capture experiment. this difference may be due to statistical fluctuations of read sampling in the downsampling process, combined with the much smaller size of the chr <dig> capture region. coverage and concordance metrics correlated with gc% of target intervals, with target intervals above the 3rd quartile of each respective capture array having less coverage and poorer concordance metrics. our work complements the study of elsharawy  <cit>  who used a greater number of matched genomic / wga samples in showing both genomic and wga samples had high concordance and sensitivity metrics to hapmap iii sites, but whose study examined only  <dig> exons. a limitation of our study is that we only have  <dig> genomic/wga sample pair for each of the capture experiments, and the chr <dig> experiment captured a much smaller region of genomic dna. since the genomic sequencing was not repeated, we cannot know the expected discrepancy for a technical replicate, but we were able to validate a subset of our snp calls that overlapped sites on the affymetrix snp array. thus, our conclusions about allele bias, and the relationship between gc% content and genotype concordance must be taken with caution, but overall suggest that wga samples can be used effectively in re-sequencing studies and thus offer a promising alternative for variant discovery studies using archived dna.
