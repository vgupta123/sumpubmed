BACKGROUND
the potassium voltage-gated channel, isk-related family, member  <dig> -gene is located on chromosome 21q <dig>  and stretches over three exons, with the coding  <dig> bp being confined to the third and last exon  <cit> . the encoded protein  is a single-span membrane protein of about  <dig>  kda that coassembles with kcnq <dig> , thus forming the slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium  channel of heart muscle, inner ear, and a variety of other tissues  <cit> . upon docking of kcne <dig> to kcnq <dig>  activation and deactivation kinetics of iks channels are slowed down by nearly two orders of magnitude  <cit> . this renders kcne <dig> an interesting candidate for studying the causes of cardiovascular diseases and congenital as well as aquired hearing loss. particularly, the inherited long-qt syndrome  has repeatedly been linked to polymorphisms of kcne <dig> . lqts occurs with or without accompanying deafness and is characterized by delayed ventricular repolarization, visible as a prolonged electrocardiographic qt interval. the dysfunction predisposes patients to ventricular tachyarrhythmia, syncope, and sudden cardiac death. as sudden death may occur with the first syncope and lqts diagnosis based solely on electrocardiography is neither sensitive nor specific enough, it is of outmost importance to screen subjects at risk for a genetic predisposition to lqts.

several population-wide screens have recently been carried out to check for the relevance of the supposed association between genomic kcne <dig> variants and qt length. two of these studies identified qt-modifying single nucleotide polymorphisms  in non-coding regions of the kcne <dig> locus, in particular in intron  <dig>  <cit>  and in a putative promoter region  <cit> . family based association analysis showed a significant association between qt length and an a/g-snp at nucleotide position  <dig>  that codes for a glycine/serine polymorphism at codon  <dig>   <cit> . the same snp is undisputably associated with mortality and t-wave alternans in electrocardiograms  <cit>  as well as with high noise susceptibility and noise-induced hearing loss  <cit> . on the other hand, an association between gly38ser and qt length has been questioned by other association studies  <cit> . different genetic backgrounds of the studied populations have been discussed to account for the conflicting results. for example, kcne <dig> may be in linkage disequilibrium to adjacent causal variants only in some ethnic groups, but not in others  <cit> . however, since all available association studies exclusively used genomic information, some additional factors might have had a confounding effect on the results of association studies. firstly, one of both alleles might have been silenced in some individuals, due to genomic imprinting or null mutations in the regulatory region. secondly, genomic recoding at the mrna level might have contributed to the observed patterns. according to this, an adenosine deaminase acting on rna  might sporadically have recoded the adenosine at kcne <dig> codon  <dig>  to inosine , which is equivalent to guanosine  for the translational machinery  <cit> . to pick up this thought we compared allele frequencies of genomic  and complementary dnas  from a total of  <dig> human individuals. furthermore to get an idea about the selective forces behind kcne <dig> evolution we analyzed the available human population genetic data  as well as orthologs  from  <dig> non-human mammals .

RESULTS
genotyping of human samples and allele frequencies in the gdna/cdna comparison
direct sequencing of kcne1-coding gdnas revealed that  <dig> out of  <dig> lymphoblastoid cell lines were heterozygous for gly38ser, while six and four cell lines were homozygote for 38ser and 38gly, respectively. kcne <dig> sequencing of gdnas of  <dig> brain samples  added another five heterozygotes gly38ser, four homozygotes 38ser, and five homozygotes 38gly. all genotypes were confirmed once  and twice  using a reverse pyrosequencing assay . we take the wide agreement of the results from direct sequencing and pyrosequencing and particularly the exclusive detection of one allele in homozygotes as evidence for the reliability of the present reverse pyrosequencing assay. twofold parallel pyrosequencing of cdnas coding for kcne <dig> widely reflected the patterns described for gdnas : heterozygotes displayed an about 50: <dig> distribution of 38gly- and 38ser-coding alleles. moreover, when homozygotes had been analysed, the pyrosequencing assay revealed an extensive  excess of either the 38gly- or the 38ser-coding allele. in contrast to the general agreement of the allele frequencies inferred from gdnas and cdnas, we found exclusively 38gly-coding alleles in the cdnas of three individuals  that had been genotyped as heterozygotes gly38ser. brain sample  <dig> was conspicuous on the gdna level, too: though clearly heterozygous, pyrosequencing persistently detected less 38ser-  than 38gly-coding alleles  in a total of eight parallel measurements.

*the genotype of brain sample  <dig> has been verified by a total of eight parallel measurements . it is marked with bold as it exerts an absolute depletion of 38ser-coding alleles  at the cdna level.

we additionally pyrosequenced the highly heterozygous a/g-snp rs <dig> of the housekeeping gene trna aspartic acid methyltransferase  <dig> . based on gdnas and cdnas we found no evidence for a complete depletion of one allele in the cdnas of  <dig> heterozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines. instead, all heterozygotes were confirmed on the cdna level. this suggests that neither rna extraction nor specific conditions of some of the samples affected the allele quantification of the kcne1-snp rs <dig> 

population genetic analyses of hapmap phase ii data
as can be seen from table  <dig>  the gly38ser polymorphism is present not only in our own sample, but also in the genepools of those populations that had been genotyped in the course of phase ii of the hapmap project . of particular interest is the finding of both alleles in sub-saharan yoruba, as this population is commonly regarded as the deepest coalescing among the sampled ones . thereafter, it is very likely that the a/g-snp at kcne <dig> codon  <dig> was already present before the divergence of modern humans. table  <dig> moreover illustrates a general trend for selection in favour of heterozygotes: compared to the expectation, there are persistently less observed homozygotes  and more observed heterozygotes  in central europeans, han chinese, and yoruba. consequently, fstat calculates a negative fixation index, fis, for these samples. in case of the yoruban sample, homozygotes 38ser are even absent, though  <dig> homozygotes 38ser are to be expected given the allele frequencies. the yoruban sample is also specific in that probability test statistic  indicates a significant  heterozygote excess exclusively in this sample, even when the p-value has been adjusted for multiple testing . finally, it is worth to note that japanese from tokyo represent the only exception from the general trend for selection in favour of heterozygotes: expected and observed genotype counts are the same with respect to homozygotes and nearly identical regarding the heterozygotes. we expect that a future extension of the hapmap dataset will change some details of the picture outlined above. for instance, it appears probable to us that additional data on the yoruban population will contribute homozygotes 38ser. it may moreover happen that the reported extent of heterozygote excess in central europeans, han chinese, and yoruba will change with additional data. however, we are confident that the general trends inferred from the present dataset  will be confirmed in the future.

han chinese,
comparison of the observed  and expected  genotype counts reveals a general trend for less observed homozygotes and more observed heterozygotes than expected. in case of the yoruban sample, the heterozygote excess is even significant .

evolution of the kcne <dig> gene in eutherian mammals
the gdnas and cdnas of the  <dig> non-human species either encode aspartate  or glutamate  at the codon position homolog to codon  <dig> in human kcne <dig>  there was no evidence for a polymorphism of the codon under scrutiny in any of the non-human species for which snp data were available at the time of the study . neither did databank mining reveal any hint for genomic recoding of this particular codon in the non-human sample, as indicated by identical triplets in the gdna/cdna comparison in bornean orangutan, house mouse, norway rat, guinea pig, european rabbit, cattle, and cat .

accession numbers of new entries are highlighted by "ne". sequences that have been used for paml analyses are labeled with "pa".

in line with the overall prevalence of gat  at the site corresponding to codon  <dig> in human kcne <dig>  baseml suggests gat as the ancestral character state at the base of the tree . mapping the extant as well as the ancestral character states onto the phylogeny in figure  <dig> suggests that only few evolutionary steps occurred since the last common ancestor of the studied species. thus, two independent synonymous substitutions from gat to gac can be assumed for the terminal branch to cat and for the internal branch uniting pika and european rabbit. moreover, the cattle and horse branches are characterized by a parallel non-synonymous substitution changing the coding from gat to gag. however, the associated exchange from asp to glu is conservative since both amino acids are negatively charged . the functional consequences of the asp/glu shift can thus be regarded as neglegible.

the human stem lineage represents the only exception from the wide phylogenetic conservation of codon  <dig> and its counterparts . according to the presence of the gly38ser polymorphism in all human populations studied , two non-synonymous transitions can be assumed for the branch leading to modern humans: 1) a change from gat to ggt, and, thus, from asp to glycine , and 2) a shift from ggt to agt, which corresponds to a gly to ser replacement at the amino acid level . both, the asp/gly shift  and the gly/ser shift  are moderately radical. the moderately radical character of the amino acid exchanges argues for their effectiveness without disrupting protein function . in accordance with the human-specificity of the ser38gly polymorphism, branch-site analysis  provides highly significant support  for the branch-site test of positive selection across the human foreground. not surprisingly, codon  <dig> of human kcne <dig> belongs to the specific site class  that is under positive selection across the human foreground , but is under negative selection  or neutral evolution  across the remaining phylogeny . the other codon sites belonging to this specific site class are codons  <dig> and  <dig>  the high ω-value assigned to the specific site class  most likely results from the short branch leading to modern humans. irrespectively, there is no doubt about the nature of the selective force acting particularly on codon  <dig> of human kcne <dig>  i.e. strong positive darwinian selection .

codon sites pinpointed as positively selected across the human foreground:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> .

motif search and western blotting
according to results from prosite motif search the human 38gly variant is characterized by a glycosaminoglycan attachment motif  spanning from amino acid positions 37– <dig> that is absent in the 38ser variant and the non-human kcne <dig> orthologs. motiv search moreover found motivs for n-glycosylation, protein kinase c phosphorylation, and n-myristoylation offside the glycosaminoglycan attachment motif . to adress the question whether the evolution of the gly38ser polymorphism in humans entailed differences in glycosylation, we expressed different kcne <dig> variants in human hek <dig> cells and analysed the kcne <dig> proteins by western blotting . beside the  <dig> kda kcne <dig> proteins, most probably representing the nascent forms  we could also detect slower migrating kcne <dig> proteins, representing the mature, posttranslationally modified proteins . the mobility shift resulted from n-glycosylation as addition of the n-glycosylation inhibitor tunicamycin resulted in complete loss of slower migrating kcne <dig> variants . however, both human variants and the chimpanzee ortholog of kcne <dig>  revealed no obvious differences in mobility. this shows that all kcne <dig> variants are highly n-glycosylated and suggests that the 38gly variant does not confer an extra glucosaminoglycan modification. therefore, we conclude that the presumed functional differences linked to the specific evolution of kcne <dig> codon  <dig> in humans are not due to differences in posttranslational modification. instead, they seem to be caused exclusively by the moderately radical character of the involved amino acid exchanges .

discussion
deviating allelic copy numbers in one heterozygote gly38ser brain sample
as outlined above, we consider the presented pyrosequencing results as very reliable, because all gdna based runs confirmed the genotypes inferred from direct sequencing. this applies particularly to brain sample  <dig> whose deviating allelic copy numbers had even been validated by a total of eight measurements. it can thus be excluded that technical problems account for the about 20: <dig> distribution of 38ser- and 38gly-coding alleles in the gdna of brain sample  <dig>  accumulating experimental evidence suggests that neural progenitor cells often display loss and/or gain of chromosomes. consequently, a considerable percentage of aneuploid neurons populate the mature brain  <cit> . chromosome painting studies, for instance, revealed approximately 4% chromosome  <dig> aneuploid cells  in normal adult human brain  <cit> . these aneuploid neurons are projected into the appropriate anatomical areas and appear to be functionally active  <cit> . in this light, genetic mosaicism must be considered a frequently observable feature of the human brain. the most likely explanation for the uneven distribution of chromosome  <dig> alleles in brain sample  <dig> is gain and/or loss of a chromosome  <dig> copy in a relatively high proportion of cells in the dissected cortex area. another possibility could be a uniparental disomy for chromosome  <dig> , since the sampled man was phenotypically normal, what is a general feature of upd <dig>  <cit> . however, as the question for the underlying mechanism is second ranked in the present context we did not further investigate the alternatives herein.

sporadic deficiency of 38ser-coding mrnas in heterozygote humans
four different mechanisms could principally explain the observed absence of 38ser-coding alleles in cdnas from three individuals with a heterozygous genotype : i) monoallelic expression of the 38gly-coding allele as a consequence of null mutations in the regulatory region of the 38ser-coding allele, ii) allelic dropout of the 38ser-coding allele, iii) monoallelic expression of the 38gly-coding allele due to silencing of the 38ser-coding allele by genomic imprinting, and iv) genomic recoding of 38ser-coding transcripts to 38gly-coding alleles by a to i editing. we consider it very unlikely that the observed pattern results from deleterious mutations in the regulatory region since null mutations should affect not only the 38ser-coding allele. allelic dropout can further be ruled out as the 38ser allele did not drop out when analysing the other  <dig> heterozygote samples. one possible explanation for the deviating allele frequencies in the three genomically heterozygous individuals is genomic imprinting, even though kcne <dig> does not belong to the known imprinted genes, neither in humans nor in mouse  <cit> . alternatively, genomic recoding at the mrna level might account for the observed pattern. according to this, an adar sporadically recodes the adenosine at kcne <dig> codon  <dig>  to inosine , which is equivalent to guanosine  for the translational machinery  <cit> . this assumption is additionally corroborated by a hint for a to i editing at kcne <dig> codon  <dig> in genbank entry bc <dig> . if one further considers evidence for genomic recoding of the human potassium voltage-gated channel, shaker-related subfamily, member  <dig>   <cit>  as well as of ion channels in diverse non-primate taxa such as rodents  <cit> , insects  <cit> , and molluscs  <cit> , genomic recoding might indeed be the reason for the observed specific allele frequencies in three humane heterozygotes. future investigations will finally clarify whether genomic imprinting or genomic recoding are causative for the sporadic occurence of deviating allele frequencies in the gdna/cdna comparison in humans. irrespectively, the present data provide first time evidence for the coincidence of positive selection at a polymorph codon site and the sporadic absence of one allele in the mrna of heterozygotes.

functional considerations in the light of kcne <dig> variance and divergence
the finding that the gly38ser polymorphism is a human-specific feature that emerged under positive selection poses the question for its adaptive value . given the relevance of iks channels for inner ear homeostasis and the function of muscles and neurons it is tempting to speculate that the evolution of the gly38ser polymorphism is connected to the physiological challenges of specific human features such as speech perception, upright and enduring walking, and advanced cognitive capabilities. regardless of these speculations, the evolution of the human-specific gly38ser polymorphism probably conferred some functional advantage at the cellular level. this conclusion agrees well with the results of a recent study showing an involvement of the gly38ser polymorphism in the fine-tuning of iks channels  <cit> . as we found no evidence for changes in glycosylation between the chimpanzee protein and the two human kcne <dig> variants , the functional relevance of the gly38ser polymorphism most probably results from the moderately radical character of the amino acid exchanges involved . while amino acid position  <dig> belongs to the extracellular n-terminus of human kcne <dig>  the two other amino acid sites pinpointed herein as positively selected  belong to the intracellular c-terminus  <cit> . as such they might be involved in the interaction with kcnq <dig>  namely in the regulation of channel assembly, open-state destabilization, and kinetics of channel deactivation  <cit> .

according to the population genetic data a subtle heterozygote advantage accounts for the maintenance of the gly38ser polymorphism in humans. however, the extent of such an heterozygote advantage might depend on the environment, since we found a significant heterozygote excess solely in yoruba from nigeria, but nearly no differences between the observed and expected genotype counts in japanese from tokyo . the depletion of 38ser homozygotes in the yoruban sample and particularly the sporadic absence of 38ser-coding mrnas in central europeans further suggest that the expression of the 38ser allele is disadvantageous under certain conditions. 38ser to 38gly recoding or monoallelic expression of the 38gly allele might then represent mechanisms to be functionally homozygote 38gly when required by specific physiological conditions. beyond this, there might be individual differences in the capability of genomic recoding or genomic imprinting. such a scenario could explain why we found a depletion of 38ser-coding alleles only in two out of  <dig> heterozygous cell lines and one out of five heterozygous brain samples.

CONCLUSIONS
it is well established that aberrant editing patterns can lead to diseases such as epilepsy  <cit> , depression  <cit> , amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  <cit>  and malignant gliomas  <cit> . likewise, genomic imprinting is assumed to play a role in the susceptibility to diverse diseases  <cit> . in extension of this, individual differences in the capability of suppressing the expression of the 38ser variant might predispose 38ser carriers more or less to lqts. for instance, sex-specific differences in the depletion of 38ser-coding mrnas could explain why the gly38ser polymorphism correlates significantly with qt length in men from north israel, but not in women  <cit> . furthermore, sporadic 38ser deficiency might have obscured the recognition of an associations between gly38ser and lqts in diverse central european cohorts . however, these are speculations since it remains an open question whether the present conclusions drawn from lymphoblastoid cell lines and brain samples can be transferred to heart tissue. provided that future investigations will confirm a sporadic depletion of 38ser- coding mrnas in heart of gly38ser heterozygotes and 38ser homozygotes, this would underline the relevance of mrna data in future association studies between gly38ser variant and lqts. for apparent reasons heart tissue can only be collected post mortem. another important question would thus be if peripheral blood lymphocytes reflect the recoding or imprinting pattern in heart tissue. only under such circumstances peripheral blood lymphocytes could be taken as a predictor for the situation in heart. irrespective of these considerations, the present evolutionary approach reveals an unusual, if not unique, pattern at the codon level, i.e. coincidence of positive darwinian selection and polymorphism with a sporadically suppressed expression of one allele. this further corroborates the previously demonstrated functional relevance of the gly38ser polymorphism of kcne <dig>  <cit> .
