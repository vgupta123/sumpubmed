BACKGROUND
scorpion morphology has changed little over the last four hundred million years. in the other hand, they naturally developed venom glands as a special weapon used in prey and defense. tityus stigmurus belongs to the buthidae family, widely distributed around the world and comprising all the species considered of medical interest  <cit> . in brazil, scorpions from the genus tityus are responsible for most reported envenomation accidents, primarily tityus serrulatus, tityus stigmurus and tityus bahiensis <cit> . t. stigmurus is the main causal agent of scorpionism in the northeast; its envenomation is often characterized by local symptoms, such as: pain , hyposthesia , edema , erythema  and paresthesia   <cit> . nishikawa  <cit>  reported that t. stigmurus venom is the most toxic  when compared to t. serrulatus and t. bahiensis. nevertheless, t. serrulatus is the only species that has been significantly studied.

in addition to their clinical relevance, scorpion venoms are known to contain a very complex mixture of biologically active compounds  <cit> . of these, neurotoxins are the most studied and play a key role in the pathogenesis of scorpionism. these toxins are small peptides that interact with several types of ion channels, modifying the electrical activity of excitable cells  <cit> . the most widely known ion channels recognized by these molecules are na+ channels  <cit> , k+ channels  <cit> , ryanodine sensitive ca2+ channels  <cit> , t-type ca2+ channels  <cit>  and cl- channels  <cit> . their properties make these peptides useful as molecular and pharmacological tools for studying ion channels. another noteworthy class of molecules present in the venom gland are antimicrobial peptides, which may be involved in ancient innate immunity  <cit> . there are an estimated  <dig>  distinct polypeptides found in the approximately  <dig> known scorpion species worldwide  <cit> , representing a broad scope for drug research and development.

the venoms of t. stigmurust. serrulatus and t. bahiensis have similar toxic components and display a high degree of cross reactivity between specific antiserums  <cit> . earlier studies reported the sequence of some t. stigmurus toxins, homologous to the previously known gama, iii- <dig> and iv- <dig> toxins from t. serrulatus. these were named tst- <dig>  tst- <dig> and tst- <dig>  respectively,  <cit>  and are toxic to mice, recognizing na-channels through different modes of action  <cit> . holaday et al.  <cit>  purified butantoxin, a k-channel blocker from the three medically important tityus species mentioned above. potassium channel toxins were also predicted in tityus stigmurus venom using a proteomic approach  <cit> .

although the scorpion venom repertoire has been extensively investigated by pcr-based methods conducted with cdna libraries  <cit> , this strategy, in addition to cloning, isolation and characterization procedures, is limited by the specificity of the pcr primers used. in recent years, the number of proteomic and transcriptomic analyses performed has increased  <cit> , since they are better able to assess venom diversity. thus, in addition to known venom peptides and proteins, non yet described molecules can also be obtained. moreover, transcriptomics has the advantage of providing insight into biological processes occurring in venom gland cells.

previous investigations have used milked scorpion glands to achieve an enriched toxin library  <cit> ; however, only one used a so called “replete” venom gland not actively engaged in regenerating venom  <cit> . few scorpion nucleotide sequences are currently deposited in public databases, particularly for the tityus genus, despite its clinical importance. the present study describes the transcriptomic expression of t. stigmurus scorpion from non-stimulated venom glands, using specimens collected in the urban area of natal, brazil.

RESULTS
overview of ests from the venom gland of t. stigmurus
after poor-quality sequences were discarded, the remaining  <dig> high-quality ests were used to analyze gene expression profile in the venom gland of t. stigmurus. ests were grouped into  <dig> clusters,  <dig> corresponding to ‘contigs’ and  <dig> to ‘singlets’ . as such, these clusters were considered putative unigenes, although some may still represent different segments of the same gene. all sequence data reported in this investigation have been submitted to the public database . the average length of ests was  <dig> pb and length distribution is shown in figure <dig> 

sequence clusters were denominated tsti0001c to tsti0037c, for clusters with more than one est, or tsti0038s to tsti0153s for those containing only one est. when compared to data from genbank and dbest, we found that of the  <dig> clusters  identified,  <dig> exhibited significant similarities to known cdna and protein sequences. this corresponds to  <dig> clones ; the remaining  <dig>  were not identified and defined as “no hit”. six clusters exclusively matching mitochondrial dnas, mrnas and ribosomal rnas were also found and excluded from quantitative analyses.

clusters were organized into three categories: proteins similar to well-known venom toxins, molecules with probable toxic activity and proteins associated with cellular functions. figure <dig> shows that ‘known toxins’ represent 41% of all cdnas  and  <dig> % of defined sequences, while ‘other possible venom molecules’ correspond to 34% of all cdnas  and  <dig> % of defined sequences. ‘cellular proteins’ represent  <dig> % of the total number of clones and 17% of the matching clones. the remaining sequences are transcripts that do not match database sequences .

table <dig> shows the twelve most abundant transcript groups, all related to ‘known toxins’ or ‘other possible venom molecules’ products, except for the “unknown function” and “arginine kinase” groups.

the  indicates detection of a putative signal peptide, predicted using the signalp  <dig>  program .  <dig> signal peptides were detected in some clusters.

known toxins
six known toxin-related groups were identified in the tityus stigmurus venom gland transcriptome: α-ktx-like, β-ktx-like, α-natx-like, β-natx-like, hypotensins and antimicrobial peptides. figure <dig> exhibits the repertoire of known toxins found in this investigation.

potassium channel toxins 
potassium channel toxins have been reported in almost all scorpion species studied. they are  <dig> to  <dig> amino acid residues in length and densely packed by three or four disulfide bridges  <cit> . ten clusters  were identified as putative α-ktx toxin precursors, the second most abundant of the ‘known toxins’. two  were similar to the short toxin structural class found in tityus serrulatus venom, consisting of tspep <dig>  tspep <dig> and tspep <dig>   <cit> . tsti0075s and tspep <dig> contain  <dig> amino acid residues and the predicted signal peptide differs in only two amino acids, meaning it may encode the same mature peptide. tsti0109s has a shorter sequence, with a length of  <dig> amino acids, and its predicted mature sequence shares 91% identity with tst- <dig>  previously recorded in t. stigmurus venom using a proteomic approach  <cit> . two other clusters  exhibited 68% and 93% identity with the t. costatus toxin α-ktx  <dig>   <cit> . other cysteine-rich sequences showed homology to alpha-ktx peptides, with tsti0016c the most representative containing  <dig> clones. tsti0016c is 60% identical to “cysteine-rich peptide clone 2”, a putative toxin from t. costatus <cit> . in regard to sequences matching β-ktx, we obtained  <dig> related clusters , all of which could be aligned to the “orphan” components tcokik, ttrkik, tdikik and bmtxkβ found in t. costatust. trivitattust. discrepans and mesobuthus marteensi, respectively . these components were assumed to be authentic orthologous genes and denominated as “orphan” since their function is not well defined  <cit> .

tsti0003c may be a new member of this orthologous genes family, displaying greater similarity to β-ktx genes from t. costatus  and t. trivitattus  when compared to the other family members .

sodium channel toxins 
the venom of scorpions from the buthidae family contains abundant sodium channel toxins, in contrast to non-buthidae scorpions. these neurotoxins are involved in envenomation lethality  <cit> . however, some reports focusing on molecular analysis of the scorpion venom repertoire have proved that variations in venom composition may occur due to uncontrolled external factors, including depletion and environmental conditions  <cit> . in addition, considering the relative number of clusters, low representation of sodium channel toxins in buthidae scorpions was previously found in the lychas mucronatus transcriptome, in which sodium toxins accounted for  <dig> % of clusters  <cit> . this finding is similar to that of our study on tityus stigmurus transcriptome, in which we obtained only two clusters  encoding for α-natx-like sequences and  <dig>  for β-natx-like sequences . this fact may be associated with lower lethality of tityus stigmurus human envenoming when compared to tityus serrulatus accidents.

another similar case was that of hottentota judaicus scorpion “resting” venom glands, where sodium channel toxins were underrepresented and the αnatx:βnatx ratio inversed  <cit> . sequences matching tst- <dig> , tst- <dig>  and tst- <dig>  were also found in this group.

hypotensins
bradikynin potentiating peptides , peptides with hypotension properties, have been described in different animal venoms, including snakes, frogs and scorpions  <cit> . these peptides usually inhibit angiotensin converting enzymes  and the breakdown of endogenous vasodilator bradykinin, leading to reduced systemic blood pressure  <cit> . recently, verano-braga  <cit>  discovered a group of bpps in tityus serrulatus venom  containing 24– <dig> amino acid residues. they display bradykinin-potentiating activity, without ace inhibition, and their anti-hypertension activity appears to be caused by nitric oxide -dependent mechanisms. interestingly, we identified one cluster  showing high identity with the abovementioned hypotensins in the middle-region. the tsti0006c cluster encodes a precursor with  <dig> amino acid residues and a putative  <dig> amino acid-long signal peptide . it is important to note that pharmacological activity in these peptides seems to be located towards the c-terminal, suggesting a post-translational modification in this region since the predicted mature peptide has  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> .

amps 
antimicrobial peptides are commonly found in scorpion transcriptomes  <cit> . they play an important role in innate immune systems and may depolarize neuronal cells inducing prey immobilization, as well as potentiate the action of other neurotoxins  <cit> . surprisingly, amps were the most abundant category among toxins and the second when considering the entire transcriptome . high expression levels in amps were previously reported in lychas mucronatus scorpions on hainan, a hot, humid island in southern china. these characteristics could cause greater susceptibility to pathogenic microbial infections  <cit> . interestingly, a similar climate is found in the city where t. stigmurus specimens were collected. in addition, t. stigmurus are frequently found in sewage pipes hunting for prey, mainly cockroaches. it is therefore not coincidence that many envenomation cases occur in bathrooms. thus, effective defenses are needed in this environment. tsti0001c is the most representative transcript in this category .

other possible venom molecules
some transcripts found in t. stigmurus venom glands resembled putative molecules with potential toxic activity and were therefore classified as ‘other possible venom molecules’. five groups fit into this category: lectins, metalloproteases, anionic peptides, hypothetical secreted peptides and cystein-rich peptides.

lectins
lectins have not been reported for scorpions in transcriptomic, proteomic or related approaches. as such, to the best of our knowledge, there are no scorpion lectin sequences currently deposited in public databases, although lectins have been isolated from scorpion venom and hemolymph using chromatographic procedures  <cit> . despite the lack of information on lectins in scorpion venoms, they have been studied in other venomous animals, such as fish, snakes and spiders  <cit>  and may be involved in innate immunity. our library contains two clusters  with arthropod lectin-like sequences.

anionic peptides
anionic peptide precursors are molecules with high acidic amino acid content. unexpectedly, this category exhibits the most expressed transcripts . anionic peptides have been recorded in both buthidae and non-buthidae scorpions  <cit> , although they seem much more abundant in the former. their function remains unclear, but one hypothesis suggests two possible roles: to help balance the ph value of the venom solution, since most scorpion venom peptides are basic, or to act synergistically with other peptides  <cit>  .

metalloproteases
alhough scorpion venom research has focused primarily on neurotoxic peptides, proteolytic activity has also been described  <cit> . two types of proteases have already been characterized in scorpion venom glands: serineproteases  and metalloproteases  <cit> . serine- and metalloproteases were also detected in venom transcriptomic analysis of other animals  <cit> . despite the lack of transcripts similar to spsvs, metalloproteases are significantly represented by  <dig> clusters . four of these are similar to antareases, a venom protein from t. serrulatus. antarease is a divalent ion-dependent protease that cleaves vesicle-associated membrane proteins  at specific sites, leading to significant alterations in vesicular transport and secretory mechanisms. this action may be involved in pathogenesis mechanisms, including acute pancreatitis induction  <cit> . an additional two clusters encode for putative m <dig> metalloprotease and angiotensin converting enzymes from the hottentotta judaicus scorpion.

hypothetical secreted peptides
several transcripts  were similar to hypothetical secreted peptides from other scorpions. the function of these peptides is unknown; however, according to our data, some clones appear to be conservative in scorpion and arachnid venom or salivary glands. further characterization is needed for clones belonging to this category. an interesting finding is the significantly expressed contig tsti022c , showing 91% identity with a partial mass spectrometry protein sequence  from a tityus stigmurus venom proteomic analysis  <cit> . another finding is igfbp  domain containing sequences . igfbps modulate the physiological actions of insulin-like growth factors  in several types of tissues  <cit> , including tumor cells  <cit> . other scorpion and insect venom molecules also had igfbp domains  <cit>  .

cysteine-rich secretory peptides
cystein-rich secretory peptides  are widely distributed in the animal, plant and fungal kingdoms, with variable primary sequences  <cit> , including different animal venoms  <cit> . the scp_crisp-like domain containing sequence is a cluster with  <dig> clones , similar to other arachnid and insect cysteine-rich peptides. interestingly, as with helothermine  <cit> , lizard venom crisps block ca++ transporting ryanodine receptors, while the opposite action is reported for neurotoxins belonging to the calcin family found in scorpions  <cit> .

the first analysis of a non-buthidae scorpion resulted in  <dig> high-quality ests, which allowed the authors to examine the molecular repertoire of the venom gland  <cit> . similar approaches have been applied with buthidae and non-buthidae scorpions species, showing marked differences in diversity and repertoire of toxin-like sequences  <cit> . the venom components commonly found in transcriptomics are sodium channel toxins, potassium channel toxins, calcines, amps, bpps, phospholipases a <dig>  anionic peptides and glycine-rich peptides. of these, only calcines, phospholipases a <dig> and glycine-rich peptides were not found in this study. the main novelty of this investigation is to present some poorly or as yet undescribed transcripts in scorpion venoms such as: lectins, metaloproteases, cystein-rich peptides and hypothetical secreted proteins.

scorpion venom proteome studies have been previously carried out, although most components have not been sequenced  <cit> . thus, a comparative proteomic analysis with other scorpion venoms is difficult to obtain. nevertheless, the following transcripts match proteins found in tityus sp. venom itself, using either proteomics or isolation and characterization approaches, as follows: tsti0022c , tsti0051s , tsti0033c , tsti0151s and tsti0048s , tsti0109s , tsti0140s , tsti0016c , tsti0075s , tsti0006c  and some antareases-like sequences .

cellular proteins
in addition to transcripts predicted to be involved in venom toxicity, there are other housekeeping genes in t. stigmurus venom glands. figure <dig> shows the  <dig> clones  found in this study corresponding to ‘cellular proteins’, most of which are responsible for cellular metabolism  and transcription/translation .

the majority of transcripts involved in ‘cellular metabolism’ are similar to cytochrome c oxidase , followed by arginine kinase . clusters tsti0014c, tsti0037c and tsti0065s are similar to cytochrome c oxidase subunits  <dig> or  <dig>  tsti0014c resembles cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> from centruroides noxius. the terminal oxidase in respiratory chains of eukaryotes and most bacteria, is a multi-chain transmembrane protein located in the inner membrane of mitochondria and the cell membrane of prokaryotes . in parallel, cluster tsti0013c  is similar to arginine kinase  from litopenaeus vanname shrimp. members of this enzyme family play a key role in animals as atp-buffering systems for cells with high and variable rates of atp turnover .

the venom gland is an organ specialized in venom production, with almost 75% of the transcripts ‘known’ or ‘possible’ toxins. we can therefore assume that a substantial metabolic expenditure is required for this task, resulting in a natural demand for energy and transcription/translation functions. the next most abundant transcripts were ‘structural proteins’  such as actin and myosin. the presence of these transcripts is not surprising, since telson is known to contain compressor muscles, whose function is to press the glands against the cuticle along its exterior lateral and ventral surfaces  <cit> . cluster tsti0018c  exhibits similarity with myosin light chain  <dig> from the avicularia avicularia spider, a ca2+-binding protein  .

other relevant categories were ‘cell regulation’ , ‘processing and sorting’  and transcripts with unknown functions . in the last, we found  <dig> clusters matching ‘hypothetical proteins’ from arachnids .

taken together, these results represent important clues for the characterization of cellular and molecular functions in scorpion venom glands. moreover, the repertoire generated in this approach is relevant in highlighting the transcripts of t. stigmurus venom glands, contributing to the international “genbank” database and allowing subsequent isolation and application of these molecules.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study describes the profile of gene expression present in the venom glands of tityus stigmurus scorpions using a transcriptomic approach. this profile shows a wide range of structural and functional putative molecules in tityus stigmurus venom glands. six known protein types were identified, including ‘potassium channel’  , ‘sodium channel’ , ‘hypotensins’ and ‘antimicrobial peptides’, and five atypical types of venom peptides and proteins, such as ‘lectins’, ‘anionic peptides’, ‘metalloproteases’, ‘hypothetical secreted peptides’ and ‘cystein-rich peptides’. this strategy confirms the highly specialized nature of scorpion venom glands as toxin producers, enabling the description, for the first time, of putative proteins involved in cellular processes relevant to venom gland function of t. stigmurus. in particular, transcripts encoding antimicrobial peptides and anionic peptides were the most representative transcripts in this database. the transcriptome of t. stigmurus did not show high expression of sodium channel toxins as one might expect from a buthidae scorpion, primarily for subfamily α. this type of toxin is the most studied among scorpions from the genus tityus and has often been related to the severity of poisoning. its absence may be associated to environmental conditions, where more antibacterial defenses may be required than neurotoxins for prey, since food is abundant. it may also be a characteristic of scorpion venom-filled glands in a resting stage.

this database of scorpion molecules described here may be an important resource for the investigation and characterization of proteins or peptides potentially applicable in pharmaceutical research and biotechnology.
