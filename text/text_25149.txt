BACKGROUND
hybridization is a phenomenon that happens when mating between individuals from different species generates viable offspring and is a process that is estimated to occur in approximately 25 % of all plant species  <cit> . hybridization can sometimes lead to introgression if f <dig> hybrids backcross to one or both parental species and foreign genetic material is integrated into the genomes of either parent  <cit> . if hybrids or backcrossed individuals have increased fitness and develop reproductive isolation, hybridization and introgression can lead to diversification and speciation , which has been demonstrated in for example wild sunflowers and louisiana irises  <cit> . in regions where previously geographically isolated species or populations meet, hybrid zones can form  <cit>  if hybridization and introgression happens. hybrid zones thus provide the opportunity to study evolutionary processes associated with interactions between species or differentiated populations. the genetic composition of hybrid zones depends to a large extent on the intensity of reproductive isolation and gene flow among interacting populations, which determines the frequency of f <dig> relative to introgressed f <dig> individuals .

in the past, hybrids were characterized solely based on morphology, however the use of morphological traits alone may not be sufficient to identify all hybrids or introgressed individuals  <cit> , which was demonstrated by hardig et al.  <cit>  that failed to detect several hybrids between salix eriocephala and s. sericea with only morphological characters. therefore, in addition to morphological characteristics, molecular markers provide a good tool for assessing the degree of gene flow and genetic structure of hybrid zones. due to the contrasting modes of inheritance of chloroplast and nuclear dna they are expected to generate different patterns of genetic diversity within and among populations  <cit> . thus a combination of nuclear and chloroplast markers can be used to disentangle the complex mode of gene flow in hybrid zones. for example, maternally inherited chloroplast markers allow the assessment of the maternal parent of the hybrids and the direction of hybrid matings. in addition, chloroplast dna should due to its smaller effective population size, be more sensitive to genetic drift and therefore display higher levels of population differentiation than nuclear dna  <cit> .

willows  is a plant genus with tree and shrub species that are common in riparian habitats worldwide. the genus contains about  <dig> species  <cit> , however due to an unusually complex taxonomy this number has varied greatly over time  <cit> . willow species are notoriously difficult to classify as they are often morphologically similar and display large intraspecific diversity. in addition, hybridization might further complicate classification as hybrids can display unusual morphologies. the majority of willow species are diploid with a basis chromosome number of n =  <dig>  however, ploidy levels can vary extensively both within and among species and range from diploids up to dodecaploids  <cit>  and possibly some of these polyploids are allopolyploids and the result of hybridization. the degree of hybridization has for centuries been a matter of great debate, and still is. in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s the general opinion was that hybridization was common and it was proposed that the great intraspecific morphological diversity was the result of hybridization  <cit> . still, some taxonomists believed that the role of hybridization was greatly exaggerated and that many so called hybrids were not hybrids, but mere variants within species. in order to fully understand the role of hybridization for the evolution of willows, more studies are indeed needed. nevertheless, there are several well-known cases of hybridization, for example between s. fragilis and s. alba in europe  <cit> , s. sericea and s. eriocephala in the u.s.  <cit>  and between species in the subg. vetrix e.g. s. caprea, s. cinerea, s. atrocinerea and s. aurita  <cit> .

salix viminalis l., s. dascyclados wimm. and s. schwerinii e. wolf are closely related basket willows in the subg. vetrix and are tall shrubs or trees found along streams and rivers and in other wet habitats  <cit> . salix viminalis has a huge natural distribution  <cit> , ranging from uk in the west to siberia in the east  and is the most well studied of the three species. it was in the past heavily used by humans for basketry and weaving but also for management of riverbanks and waterways  <cit> . trading of cutting materials has contributed to the dispersal of the species, which is the most likely reason why it is present in sweden, despite the fact that it is not naturally occurring in scandinavia  <cit> . salix viminalis and s. dasyclados are morphologically very similar and their distributions almost completely overlap . according to skvortsov  <cit> , the two species have taxonomically been constantly confused and since hybrids between s. viminalis and other species of subg. vetrix resemble s. dasyclados, s. dasyclados was also often regarded as a hybrid. however, skvortsov  <cit>  argued that no evidence exist that support a hybrid nature of s. dasyclados. s. schwerinii is found in east asia and parallels s. dasyclados and s. viminalis in a north-south direction over a long distance across siberia . according to skvortsov  <cit> , s. viminalis and s. schwerinii meet in many geographical regions, however, they are rarely found growing together, and s. schwerinii is regarded as “vicarious” to s. viminalis. in a previous study, large genetic differentiation was found between the species as fst was estimated to  <dig>  and coalescent simulations suggested a divergence time of around  <dig>  years, however sampling was done outside of the contact zone  <cit> .fig.  <dig> distribution ranges of the three willows species. modified from skvortsov  <cit> . orange represent s. dasyclados, blue represent s. schwerinii and yellow represent s. viminalis. note the almost complete overlap between s. dasyclados and s. viminalis and the parallell distribution of s. schwerinii. the map was created using arcgis® software by esri. arcgis® and arcmap™ are the intellectual property of esri and are used herein under license



interspecific crosses between s. viminalis × s. dasyclados and s. viminalis × s. schwerinii have been produced experimentally and pure species as well as hybrids have been extensively used in pre-breeding programs aiming at producing high-yielding varieties for biomass production in europe. for example, an experimental cross between s. viminalis ×   <cit>  has been used in several qtl studies of different traits . interestingly in a crossing experiment between s. viminalis × s. dasyclados it was found that the s. dasyclados parent was hexaploid and the offspring tetraploid  <cit> , indicating that some s. dasyclados individuals could be allopolyploids possessing genomes from several species. however, observations indicate that these three species are predominantly diploid.

in the present study we performed fine-scale genetic analysis of a contact zone with the three species salix dasyclados, s. schwerinii and s. viminalis located in the vicinity of the lake baikal in southern siberia. the main objectives were to morphologically and genetically characterize individuals in the contact zone and to estimate the frequency and direction of hybridization using  <dig> nuclear snp and four chloroplast ssr markers together with a set of morphological characters. samples were collected in fourteen populations. we specifically asked the following questions: i) is the contact zone a hybrid zone, that is, do we find hybrids or introgressed inidviduals? ii) if yes, what is the population structure of the hybrid zone? do we primarily find intermediate f <dig> hybrids or introgressed individuals? iii) is introgression uni- or bidirectional? iv) can morphology be used to predict the structure of the hybrid zone? v) what are the characteristics of the reproductive barriers between the species?

RESULTS
morphological classification
a total of  <dig> individuals were collected from fourteen populations and based on morphological characterization nineteen individuals  were classified as hybrids.

eleven were classified as s. viminalis × s. dasyclados hybrids, seven as s. viminalis × s. schwerinii hybrids and one as either a s. viminalis × s. dasyclados hybrid or a s. schwerinii × s. dasyclados hybrid . twenty-two individuals were classified as pure s. dasyclados,  <dig> as pure s. schwerinii and  <dig> as pure s. viminalis  . hybrids were encountered in eight different populations, two populations were composed of only s. schwerinii individuals and four populations were composed of only s. viminalis individuals . the populations with hybrids were located in the central parts of the sampled area, pure s. schwerinii populations were located in the eastern parts and populations with only s. viminalis were located in the western parts .fig.  <dig> population composition from analyses of nuclear snp genotypes, chloroplast haplotypes and morphological characters. for each population there are three bars. the leftmost depict results from the cluster analysis with the structure software on the nuclear snp markers and show for every population the number of individuals assigned to cluster  <dig>  and cluster  <dig> . the number of individuals with q-values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  are shown in red. the middle bars demonstrate the results from the classification based in morphological characters and shows for every population the frequency of individuals classified as s. viminalis , s. schwerinii , s. dasyclados , s. viminalis × s. schwerinii hybrids , s. viminalis × s. dasyclados hybrids  and s. schwerinii × s. dasyclados hybrids . the rightmost bars demonstrate the occurrence of chloroplast haplotypes in every population. note that kunerma and slyudyanka have only two bars, as no chloroplast haplotype data was available. the map was created using arcgis® software by esri. arcgis® and arcmap™ are the intellectual property of esri and are used herein under license



nuclear snp variation and population structure
seventy-nine individuals were successfully genotyped at  <dig> of the  <dig> nuclear snp loci, of which  <dig> were polymorphic in at least one of the individuals. both pure species and hybrids were present among these  <dig> individuals , thus they form a representative subset of all collected samples. two snps in s. schwerinii and three in s. viminalis deviated significantly from hardy-weinberg equilibrium  . one hundred and forty-six snps were polymorphic in both species,  <dig> were polymorphic only in s. viminalis and  <dig> were polymorphic only in s. schwerinii. no fixed snps were found. fst was estimated to  <dig>   in s. viminalis,  <dig>   in s. schwerinii and  <dig>  between the species . when all samples were included in clustering analysis with the structure software , the number of clusters  was estimated to  <dig>  both when the original method from pritchard et al.  <cit>  was used and with the Δk statistics given in evanno et al.  <cit>  . sixty-four individuals had q-values ≥  <dig>  and  <dig> of these were assigned to cluster  <dig> and twenty were assigned to cluster  <dig> . based on the morphological classification, all but two individuals that originated from cluster  <dig> were s. viminalis. the two other individuals were s. dasyclados, meaning that genetically s. dasyclados and s. viminalis are indistinguishable. in cluster  <dig>  nineteen out of the twenty individuals were morphologically s. schwerinii and one was a s. viminalis × s. schwerinii hybrid. individuals of s. viminalis origin were found in populations in the western parts of the sampled area and individuals with s. schwerinii origin were found in populations in the eastern parts .fig.  <dig> identification and classification of hybrids. a structure results showing the proportion of the genome of every individual originating from each of the two inferred clusters; medium-dark grey is cluster  <dig>  and light grey is cluster  <dig> . the bars between the two vertical black lines show the introgressed individuals with q-values between  <dig>  and  <dig> . b newhybrids classification for every individual with posterior probabilities for a given class; medium-dark grey is the s. viminalis class, light-grey is the s. schwerinii class, dark grey is the class with backcrosses to s. viminalis and medium-light grey is the class with backcrosses to s. schwerinii. the morphological classification of each individual sample is shown in the middle, colour coded as in fig.  <dig> 



hybrid identification
fifteen of the genotyped individuals  had q-values between  <dig>  and  <dig>  and were identified as hybrids . these individuals derive from six populations located in the centre of the sampling area . morphologically, only two were classified as hybrids , while eight were classified as s. schwerinii and three as s. viminalis  . as no q-value was close to  <dig>  , this was interpreted as no f <dig> hybrid was present among the individuals. instead, their q-values suggest that they were backcrosses both to s. viminalis and s. schwerinii. thirteen of the fifteen introgressed individuals had posterior probabilities >  <dig>  , of which seven were classified as s. schwerinii backcrosses, four as s. viminalis backcrosses and two as pure s. viminalis, while none was classified as f <dig> or f <dig> hybrids .table  <dig> classification based on q-values in structure, posterior probabilities in newhybrids and morphological characters

chloroplast ssr variation
seventy individuals originating from europe and the baikal region were successfully genotyped with the four chloroplast ssr markers. as expected, one allele per locus and individual was found for each of the markers. a total of seventeen alleles were detected and ccmp <dig> was the most variable with six alleles and ccmp <dig> the least variable with two alleles, ccmp <dig> had four and ccmp <dig> had five alleles. when combined, these alleles formed  <dig> different haplotypes. when only including the individuals from the baikal region  the phipt  was estimated to - <dig>   in s. viminalis, to  <dig>   in s. schwerinii and to - <dig>   between the species. thus, the chloroplast haplotypes did not display any significant genetic differentiation, either within or between the species . no sequence variation was found in the two sequenced chloroplast regions .

discussion
the three closely related basket willow species salix dasyclados, salix schwerinii and salix viminalis are phenotypically similar and several morphological characteristics are needed to distinguish them from each other. given that the three species recently diverged, it is possible that they would hybridize where they come into contact in nature, unless some strong reproductive barriers have evolved. to study this, individuals from all three species were sampled in fourteen populations in a region in southern siberia where the distributions of the species meet and overlap. 81 % of the genotyped individuals were assigned to one of two clusters; one composed of s. schwerinii and one of s. viminalis and s. dasyclados individuals. relatively high level of genetic differentiation was observed between the clusters , suggesting that they are largely reproductively isolated. however, 19 % of the genotyped individuals were identified as hybrids, which shows that the species boundaries are partly permeable. both the structure and the newhybrid analyses showed that none of these individuals were intermediate f <dig> hybrids but backcrosses to either s. schwerinii or s. viminalis. this observation demonstrates that introgression is bidirectional in this willow hybrid zone. furthermore, the absence of f <dig> hybrids is striking and is best explained by the presence of pre- and/or postmating reproductive barriers that form reproductive isolation between the species  <cit> . currently, we can only speculate about the nature of these barriers in this system and the relative contribution of different barriers. putative premating barriers are differences in flower phenologies or pollinator specificity  <cit>  and as willows generally are both wind and insect pollinated  <cit> , both are likely to be involved. we do not know whether or not s. schwerinii and s. viminalis display asynchronous flowering in the region of sampling. however, at our field site outside of uppsala in sweden , s. schwerinii plants flower considerably earlier than s. viminalis plants, bearing in mind that those s. viminalis plants originate from central europe and not from the region near lake baikal. possibly, postmating barriers are operating together with premating barriers to produce strong reproductive isolation, as premating barriers alone are often permeable and leaky  <cit> . however as artificial crosses between the species are routinely produced in our laboratory and f <dig> hybrids are fertile and also used to backcross to either parents, strong postmating barriers are unlikely to be present. the age of the hybrid zone may also affect the occurrence of f <dig> hybrids as in a very young zone, not enough time may have elapsed for intermediate hybrids to reach larger numbers. however as we found a substantial number of backcrossed individuals, the hybrid zone could not be very young. perhaps instead, the hybrid zone is relatively old and the intermediate hybrids have been lost as they are no longer being produced or produced at very low frequencies. it could also be, that environmental conditions and the relative proportion of species  <cit>  were conducive to hybridization during the formation of the hybrid zone but are no longer so.

an interesting observation was that chloroplast haplotypes were shared between the species and no genetic differentiation was found, even when including samples from europe. this could indeed be the result of homoplasy, however as extensive haplotype sharing has been reported in other willow  <cit>  and tree species, e.g. betula spp.  <cit>  and quercus spp.  <cit>  using entirely different markers, it is unlikely that homoplasy alone could create the observed pattern. instead, haplotype sharing is likely the result of past hybridization and/or introgression. the observation that none of the snps were fixed between the species furthermore supports the scenario that introgression happens where the two species meet. while this may well be the case, our data also suggest that to some degree the shared haplotypes and polymorphisms are ancestral polymorphism. shared ancestral polymorphism between species is expected from incomplete lineage sorting, which is particularly likely in species such as the willows that have large effective population sizes as it under those circumstances take very long time for alleles to go to fixation  <cit> . in a previous study, using sequences from s. viminalis and s. schwerinii individuals from europe and siberia, respectively, i.e. long way from the hybrid zone, divergence was estimated at  <dig>  ya  <cit> . the effective population size in our previous study was estimated to  <dig>  in both species and the generation time assumed to be 10 years. thus, the divergence time would be roughly  <dig>  ne and would be indeed insufficient to observe reciprocal monophyly. this shows that even if gene flow is not currently taking place, we expect to observe shared polymorphism due to historical gene flow and/or incomplete lineage sorting.

the chloroplast and nuclear dna gave contrasting results as there was no significant genetic differentiation with the chloroplast haplotypes, while with the nuclear genotypic data there was relatively high level of genetic differentiation. this pattern is a likely consequence of the differences in intraspecific gene flow that the nuclear and the chloroplast dna experience  <cit> . since nuclear dna is transmitted by both pollen and seeds and as chloroplast dna is transmitted only by seeds, intraspecific gene flow will be higher for nuclear dna compared to chloroplast dna. introgressed nuclear alleles will therefore be diluted and maintained at low frequencies, however introgressed chloroplast haplotypes will not be diluted to the same degree and can therefore persist in the population. this effect should be particularly significant in species where pollen can travel long distances by wind and where seeds are less prone to long distance dispersal. willow seeds are also primarily wind dispersed,  <cit> , however compared to pollen, seeds are expected to travel less far.

compared to the 19 % of the genotyped individuals that were assessed to be of hybrid origin, only 5 % were classified as hybrids using traditional morphological characteristics. most noteworthy was that eight individuals that were classified as pure s. schwerinii were in fact introgressed individuals. this demonstrates the difficulties and uncertainties in detecting hybrids solely based on morphology, which could be particularly difficult at low levels of introgression. another surprising finding was that individuals classified as s. dasyclados clustered with individuals classified as s. viminalis. as we were unable to distinguish the species from each other with this large set of markers, one conclusion could be that the sampled individuals should be regarded as one and the same species. still, they display enough morphological differences to be classified as different species by trained botanists. in order to solve this, more samples need to be analysed, both genetically and morphologically.

CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered a new hybrid zone between three willow species with rather high frequency of introgressed individuals, which were identified both with morphological characters and genotypic data. we found extensive sharing of chloroplast haplotypes between the species and a large number of shared nuclear polymorphisms, a pattern that is expected from introgression but also from ancestral polymorphisms that remain in the populations due to incomplete lineage sorting. we also demonstrated rather high levels of reproductive isolation between s. viminalis and s. schwerinii. this was further supported by the lack of intermediate f <dig> hybrids, which could be a consequence of some of reproductive barrier. in addition we found that introgression was bidirectional so that backcrosses happen with both s. schwerinii and s. viminalis. another surprising observation was the genetic similarities between s. dasyclados and s. viminalis, which leads us to doubt the taxonomic status of s. dasyclados.
