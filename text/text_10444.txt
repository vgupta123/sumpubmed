BACKGROUND
small interfering rna  molecules are capable of interrupting the translation of a specific protein by inducing post-transcriptional gene silencing. it is a promising method for silencing therapeutic target genes. a variety of delivery systems are proposed for the delivery of sirna into cells in vitro and in vivo. since phage-based vectors do not exhibit natural tropism towards mammalian cells and can be genetically modified for specific applications, modified phage-based vectors are an attractive alternative strategy for gene delivery. they have been successfully modified to deliver genes to target cells by the effective use of targeting ligands such as growth factors, antibodies, and viral capsid proteins  <cit> . to increase the density of ligand display on the phages, an epidermal growth factor -modified helper phage genome m13egfko7ct was established, which could produce egf-targeted phagemid particles  <cit> . the phagemid particles could deliver reporter genes into target cells; however, the efficiency of delivery was limited  <cit> . a topoisomerase i inhibitor such as camptothecin or hydroxycamptothecin  could substantially enhance the transduction of the phagemid gene delivery particles  <cit> . the recent studies showed that the cell-targeted phagemid particles could efficiently deliver sirna against akt into cell in the presence of hcpt  <cit> . but, no significant growth inhibition was observed. thus, to be an effective anti-cancer sirna delivery vector, more studies should be performed, such as carrying sirna against other oncogenes.

focal adhesion kinase , a non-receptor tyrosine kinase, has been implicated in several cellular processes such as proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and invasion. increased expression of fak has been found in various malignant tumors, including tumors derived from the lungs, breasts, head and neck, and ovaries  <cit> . therefore, fak is recognized as an important therapeutic target in the treatment of cancer. delivery of sifak by lipofectamine could significantly block the expression of fak and trigger cell death and block cell migration  <cit> . but, the sifak could not be delivered to target cells. to further investigate whether the egf-targeted phagemid particles in combination with rna interference  would represent an effective therapeutic approach, we used phagemid particles carrying sirna against fak to infect h <dig> cells and examined the therapeutic potential of this approach.

RESULTS
previous studies showed that the cell-targeted phagemid particles were efficient sirna delivery vectors in the presence of hcpt and they could efficiently deliver sirna against akt into targeted cells in the presence of hcpt  <cit> . but, no significant growth inhibition was observed. thus, to be an effective anti-cancer sirna delivery vector, more studies should be performed, such as carrying sirna against other oncogenes. in this study, we made phagemid particles carrying sirna against fak to infect h <dig> cells and examined the therapeutic potential of this approach. first, the short hairpin rna  against fak was subcloned into psi <dig> cmv-f <dig>  thus forming psilencer <dig> -sifak  . then, we purified ssdna from phagemid particles to analyze the ratio of phagemids to helper phage genomes packaged in the phagemid particles. the results indicated that almost all the dna packaged comprised phagemids . previously, the modified helper phage genome  m13egfko7ct was created to produce egf-targeted phagemid particles  <cit> . the m13egfko7ct plasmid was used to package psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles, following which the phagemid particles displayed the egf ligand. in the immunocytochemical assay, we found that h <dig> cells showed a strong positive egfr immunoreactivity, while very light immunostaining was observed in the u <dig> cells that were used as negative controls . therefore, we infected h <dig> cells with psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles. western blotting assay showed that the psi <dig> -sifak plasmid transfected by lipofectamine could significantly block the expression of fak. this was not observed in cells transduced with psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles without hcpt treatment. surprisingly, in hcpt treated-cells, the psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles could inhibit fak expression to a great extent. inhibition of fak expression was not found in the cells infected with mock phagemid particles . taken together, the vectors could deliver sirna to human carcinoma cells efficiently in the presence of hcpt. hcpt had been shown to increase the efficiency of transduction of the phagemid vectors  <cit> . however, the mechanism by which hcpt increased transgene expression was not fully understood  <cit> . it was thought to involve the activation of the host cell repair machinery in response to dna damage  <cit> ; however, further studies are required to confirm this.

a series of experiments were performed to determine whether the psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles could arrest h <dig> cell growth. cell growth was monitored by the mtt assay, and it was observed that all the cells grew at a similar rate at  <dig> and  <dig> h. however, a great difference began to appear at  <dig> and  <dig> h. in the presence of hcpt, the inhibitory rates were approximately 12–19% in parent and mock cells, compared with parent cells without hcpt. amazingly, the inhibitory rates reached approximately 52–61% in hcpt-treated cells infected with psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles, compared with the control cells. no significant growth inhibition was found in the cells infected with the mock vector or psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles in the absence of hcpt . in addition, we examined the growth arrest of the psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles at the 3-dimensional level. in the colony-forming ability assay, the number of colonies of psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles decreased by almost 54% in the presence of hcpt, compared with the control cells. in contrast, cells in other groups exhibited little change in the number of colonies . these data suggested that the treatment of psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles could dramatically reduce cell viability in the presence of hcpt.

furthermore, we quantified the effect of psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles on cell invasion. in the transwell invasion assay, the number of psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles transduced-cells  invading through the membrane coated with ecm gel was less than that of the control cells . the cell invasion was markedly reduced by approximately 50% in psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles transduced-cells , compared with the control cells; the other groups however showed no obvious change . thus, the above data indicated that the transfection of h <dig> cells with psi <dig> -sifak phagemid particles and the hcpt treatment could dramatically inhibit cell invasion.

rnai has revolutionized the biological sciences because it can selectively silence messenger rna  expression. however, the delivery of this rna into target cells represents the main barrier for using sirna as a novel drug against tumor targets. since filamentous phages only showed tropism for cells that expressed the appropriate receptors, this tropism could be conferred to phage particles by the expression of a targeting ligand on the phage coat  <cit> . therefore, phages would be an attractive alternative strategy for sirna delivery. this study demonstrated that egf-targeted phagemid particles in combination with rnai and the hcpt treatment represent a new therapeutic approach for silencing oncogenes. however, in order to act as a cancer gene-delivery vector, phage vectors should display other targeting ligands to increase their specificity for different types of tumors.
