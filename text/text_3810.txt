BACKGROUND
phages are believed to largely outnumber their bacterial hosts in the ecosystems  <cit>  and thus pose a significant impact on the diversification of bacteria. on the other hand, bacteria develop various defense mechanisms, such as innate and adaptive immunities to protect them against invading nucleic acids including phages and other elements such as plasmids and genomic islands. the crispr–cas  adaptive immune system is one of the mechanisms that prokaryotes have evolved to defend against invaders. the crispr–cas systems are widespread in prokaryote, and have been found in most of the archaea species and about half of the bacterial species .

the typical genomic architecture of a crispr–cas locus is composed of a crispr array, a locus of cas genes, and a leader region. generally in a crispr array, the nearly identical repeats  are separated by spacers of similar sizes: the spacers are the unique fragments acquired from foreign nucleic acid sequences. the leader sequence is an at rich ~100-500 bp nucleotide sequence, and it is believed to serve as a promoter element for its adjacent crispr transcription  <cit>  . the defense activity of the crispr-cas systems involves three steps: the acquisition of new spacers , biogenesis of crrnas , and the interference against cognate invaders guided by crrnas  <cit> . during the adaptation stage, the targeted nucleic acid sequence from the invader is integrated into the crispr array with the help of cas proteins, such as cas <dig>  cas <dig> as nuclease proteins  <cit> . during the expression and interference stages, the precursor crispr locus  is then transcribed and processed into short mature crispr rnas . together with a cas protein complex or a single cas protein—depending on the different type of interference mechanism —the crrna is guided to detect and further degrade the target dna or rna that contains the complementary sequence of the spacer .

at the broadest level, the crispr-cas systems can be divided into two classes. the class  <dig> system performs the function by a multisubunit cas protein complex, and the class  <dig> system requires only a single cas protein  in the crrna-effector complex  <cit> . the class  <dig> includes type i, iii, and iv systems, and the class  <dig> includes type ii and v systems  <cit> . the signature genes of type i-v systems are cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  csf <dig>  and cpf <dig>  respectively. five main types can be further divided into  <dig> distinct subtypes: types i a–f and u, types ii a–c, types iii a–d, a type iv and a type v based on the different combination of additional cas genes  <cit> . type i and ii crispr-cas systems provide the immunity against dna  <cit> , whereas type iii crispr-cas systems are believed to target either dna or rna  complex  has been demonstrated targets rna  <cit> ). the cpf1-family protein found in type v  crispr-cas systems has been experimentally demonstrated to perform dna interference in a recent study  <cit> .

the cas genes are usually believed to present in the direct vicinity of crispr loci  <cit> ; and in the cases when multiple crispr arrays exist, some may be distant to the cas genes. isolated crisprs, which lack nearby cas genes, were identified in a few species including listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans  <cit> , and enterococcus faecalis  <cit> . some of these isolated crisprs were observed to be expressed but not processed into small crrna , which indicates they may be the remnants of previous functional crispr–cas systems  <cit>  or be involved in the bacterial autoimmunity  <cit> . the spacer sequences in the orphan crisprs found in a. actinomycetemcomitans were antisense to bacterial self-coding genes  <cit> , which further suggests that the existence of orphan crisprs is related to the regulation of other gene expression  <cit> . in haloferax volcanii, which contains three crispr loci with almost identical repeat sequences, all three crispr loci were expressed, producing crispr rna ; however, it was found that not all crrnas can trigger successful interference  <cit> .

here we systematically examined the genomic location of the crispr–cas systems in the bacterial complete and draft genomes to quantify the tendency of co-localization of crispr array and cas genes, taking advantage of the recently updated classification of cas proteins by koonin and colleagues  <cit> . we further explored the possible explanations to the existence of isolated cas loci using representative species. from isolated crisprs , we collected highly suspicious crisprs that lack any spacer diversity  and named them false-crispr elements. it has been shown that some tandem repeats may be confused as crisprs as some of them may contain “repeat-spacer” like structures  <cit> , and staphylococcus aureus repeat  elements  could be confused as crisprs in staphylococcus aureus  <cit> . no study, however, has been carried out to systematically characterize these false-crisprs. we therefore classified the false-crisprs we identified into three categories based on their distribution in the genomes and “spacer” diversity: tandem repeats, star-like elements, and simple repeats. we note that some false-crispr elements were reported as crisprs in previous studies . we believe this would pose a severe problem if they get propagated into downstream analysis and annotations.

methods
identifying crispr-cas systems in bacterial genomes
we first used metacrt  <cit> , which we modified from crt  <cit>  , to predict the crispr arrays in complete bacterial and archaeal genomes. the genomes were downloaded in october  <dig> from the ncbi ftp website . we focused on complete reference genomes in this study, as crispr–cas systems may be found in separate contigs when draft genomes are used. however, for a few species we analyzed in detail, we augmented the list of genomes with draft genomes: including  <dig> draft genomes for streptococcus thermophilus and  <dig> draft genomes for staphylococcus aureus. in some cases, a long crispr may be split into multiple ones because of repeats containing excessive mutations or long spacers. to avoid such cases, crisprs that are close to each other  and share very similar repeat sequences were considered to be in the same locus. we then collected the consensus repeat for each putative crispr array. we clustered these consensus repeats at 90% sequence identity using cd-hit-est  <cit> . in this way, a “cluster” contains more than two crispr arrays, and a “singleton” refers to the repeats exclusively found within their corresponding crispr array.

we then used hmmscan  <cit>  to search putative proteins found in the genomes against a collection of cas families to predict putative cas proteins . in total, the collection contains  <dig> cas families, among which eight were identified from the human microbiomes   <cit> , and  <dig> were from a recent study  <cit> . since koonin and colleagues did not build models for the cas families they curated  <cit> , we used hmmbuild to construct hmm models for all of their families. considering that gene prediction is far from perfect for many genomes, for the genomes/contigs that contain crisprs but lack cas genes, we further used the fraggenescan  <cit> , a gene predictor we have developed for predicting complete as well as fragmented genes in genomic sequences, to re-predict the genes, and then performed cas gene prediction to rule out the possibility of missing cas genes because the genes were not predicted in the first place.

a cas locus defined in this study should contain at least three cas genes, at least one of which belongs to the universal cas genes for crispr adaptation  or the main components of interference module including cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  cas <dig>  csf <dig>  cas <dig>  cpf <dig>  <cit> .

determining the type of crispr-cas loci
the crispr, together with its nearby  cas genes, are defined as a crispr-cas locus. a crispr that lacks cas genes in its vicinity region is defined as an isolated crispr locus. conversely, a cas locus that does not have a nearby crispr array is called an isolated cas locus. the type of each crispr-cas locus is determined according to type signature cas genes  <cit> . we say the type assignment of a cas locus is confident if it has at least three type-consistent signature cas genes, except for type v. since only one signature gene cpf <dig> is reported for type v  <cit> , we assign type v based on a single signature gene, cpf <dig> 

calculating spacer diversity of a crispr
spacers in a true crispr array are likely to be distinct . spacer diversity, therefore, has been used as one of the indications of the activity of crispr–cas systems  <cit> . we define that a crispr contains diverse spacers if at least half of its spacers share no more than 70% sequence identity by cd-hit-est clustering  <cit> .

phylogenetic tree reconstruction
we build phylogenetic trees for selected species, using concatenated sequences of  <dig> marker genes predicted from their genomes  <cit> . to construct the phylogenetic tree, we utilized muscle  <cit>  to align the protein sequences, and applied the fasttree program  <cit>  to construct the neighbor-joining trees using the discrete gamma model with  <dig> rate categories.

availability of our results and software
we have made our results, including the crisprs, false-crisprs  at the crisprone website  for users to download. the crisprone website also provides online prediction of crispr–cas systems given genomic sequences, using a pipeline with integrated checking of false-crisprs.

RESULTS
distribution of crispr-cas systems in bacterial genomes
a total of  <dig> and  <dig> cas loci   were identified from  <dig> bacterial and  <dig> archaeal complete genomes, respectively. overall, seventy-nine percent  of them were confidently assigned to five main types , which includes  <dig>  type i cas loci,  <dig>  type ii cas loci ,  <dig>  type iii cas loci,  <dig> type iv cas loci , and  <dig> type v cas loci. these results suggest that the type i crispr-cas system is the major type found in the bacterial genomes, which is consistent with the results in previous studies  <cit> . since type iv and v crispr–cas systems are rare, in the following analyses, we focused on type i, ii and iii systems.

it has been found that many organisms lack cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes in their type iii crispr-cas loci, but the functionality of cas <dig> and cas <dig> could be provided in trans from an additional cas locus   <cit> . in our study, this scenario was also observed in type i crispr-cas loci . we found 13%  of type i and 49%  of type iii cas loci are devoid of cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes . among the cas loci lacking cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes,  <dig> type i  and  <dig>  type iii cas loci have adjacent crisprs and remote cas <dig> and/or cas <dig> genes in the same genome, suggesting that the cas <dig> and cas <dig> genes may function in trans. we found  <dig> type i and  <dig> type iii crispr-cas loci  lacking cas <dig> and cas <dig> in the genomes , which may result in losing the novel spacer acquisition ability of a crispr-cas system  while the interference ability may retain.table  <dig> distribution of cas1-cas <dig> genes pair together with crispr in three crispr-cas system types

a previous study  <cit>  has reported the distribution of the genomic distances between crispr arrays and cas loci . however, the distance distributions for each main type have not been estimated separately. we calculated and compared the distances between a crispr array and its nearest cas gene for the three main types . note that in this analysis we only include crisprs and cas loci within a  <dig>  bp window. the median distances between crisprs and the nearest cas genes are 179 bps, 103 bps, and 268 bps for type i, ii and iii systems, respectively. the pair-wise comparisons  indicate the distributions of three types of crispr-cas systems are significantly different. the results suggest that for type ii systems, their crisprs tend to be located closer to associated cas locus  than type i and type iii systems. in addition, among  <dig> type iv and 35 v crispr-cas loci, the median distance between type iv cas locus and its crispr is 137 bp and 147 bps, respectively.fig.  <dig> the distribution of the distance between crispr and the nearest cas gene for a type i, b type ii and c type iii systems. the red dash line shows the median distance




prevalence of isolated/orphan cas loci in bacterial genomes
although cas loci and crisprs tend to be clustered in the same genomic neighborhood, isolated cas loci  are found in genomes. in this study, if a cas locus  has no companion crispr array within a  <dig>  bp window, we call it an isolated locus. an isolated cas locus is considered an orphan if its companion crispr is lost from the genome. a total of  <dig>  species each were found to contain at least one isolated cas locus, resulting in a total of  <dig> and  <dig> isolated cas loci in bacterial and archaeal gnomes, respectively. 86%  of bacterial species and 31%  of archaeal species harbor only one isolated cas locus, although some may contain as many as four of such loci. in summary, among predicted cas loci, 12%  of type i, 22%  of type ii, and 28%  of type iii cas loci are found to be isolated. type iii crispr–cas systems have the highest ratio of isolated cas loci.

isolated cas loci are either remnants of crispr–cas systems without the immunity function, or they function together with remote crispr in the same genome. on the other hand, an orphan cas locus may be non-functional, or lose its immunity function but maintain other function . similarly, isolated crisprs can be non-functional , or work with distant cas locus in the same genome. below we present selected examples belonging to the different scenarios.

analysis of  <dig> streptococcus pyogenes isolates revealed a complete type i, a complete or partial  type ii crispr-cas system, and an isolated crispr associated with this species .  <dig> isolates harbor all elements, and others have some of the elements. the isolated crispr is likely to be an orphan that has lost its function, because 1) its repeat sequence is different from the repeats found in the type i and type ii systems, and 2) no spacer turnover was observed in this isolated crispr—the same set of spacers are found in this crispr across all six isolates harboring it . by contrast, crisprs associated with type i and type ii systems have diverse spacers across the different isolates. a branch  contains strains that have complete or partial loss of the type i and type ii crispr–cas systems: manfredo, mgas <dig>  mgas103; <dig> and alab <dig> have none of the systems; mgas <dig> has an incomplete type i system with cas locus but no crispr; and mgas <dig> has an incomplete type ii system with cas locus only. overall, the pattern of crispr gain and loss is consistent with the phylogenetic tree for this species , which may provide a snapshot of highly dynamic gain and loss of crispr-cas systems during the evolution of the s. pyogenes.fig.  <dig> crispr–cas systems in representative species: streptococcus pyogenes  and streptococcus thermophilus . the phylogenetic trees of the isolates are shown on the left . the tables on the right show the presence and/or absence of the individual components: colors indicate the presence, whereas white boxes indicate the absence. the numbers in the crispr columns indicate the number of spacers within corresponding crispr




the second example involves  <dig> streptococcus thermophilus strains. the total of four crispr-cas loci—including two type ii-a loci with different consensus repeats , a type iii-a system, and a type i-e system—were found in s. thermophilus : the activity of two type ii-a crispr-cas loci was demonstrated in the previous studies  <cit> , and type iii-a crispr-cas locus has been experimentally demonstrated to target the rna  <cit> . diverse spacers are found in the crisprs among these  <dig> isolates, consistent with a previous study  <cit> . complete and partial loss  of the different crispr–cas systems were observed in this species—eight of the “complete”  type iii-a cas loci lost their companion crisprs; by contrast, only three out of  <dig> type ii-a cas loci do not have companion crisprs. this is consistent with the statistics based on the crispr–cas systems in all species , which showed that type iii cas loci have the least tendency of co-locating with their companion crisprs among the three types of crispr–cas systems.

in the last example, isolated cas loci found in zymomonas mobilis are likely to function with remote crispr in the same genome. seven closely related strains  each harbor a cas locus containing type i-f signature genes, with crisprs distant in the genome. one strain , which is phylogenetically more distant from other strains, contains a type i-e cas locus and a crispr in the distance . all crisprs loci of type i-f, scattered in the genomes, share the same repeat sequence. the large variety of crispr length and spacer sequences, together with the “complete” subtype i cas loci, implies that the type i cas loci together with the remotely crispr loci may still be active.

curation of false-crisprs
a total of  <dig>  putative crisprs were predicted including  <dig>  from complete bacterial and  <dig> from archaeal genomes. all crisprs are first grouped based on their consensus repeat sequences , resulting in a total of  <dig> groups, each containing at least two crisprs and  <dig> singletons . groups of putative crisprs are then evaluated using two criteria.  are crisprs in a group tend to be located near cas genes? if not, are there cas loci in the same genomes though they are far from the crisprs?  do crisprs contain diverse spacers?

we consider a group of putative crisprs containing at least one crispr with companion cas genes a group of “real” crisprs . therefore, all of the putative crisprs belonging to this group are considered to be real crisprs . for example, the crispr found in aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strain  <dig> does not have nearby cas genes, but it shares similar repeat sequences  with other crisprs found together with subtype i-f cas genes in genomes including actinobacillus equuli subsp. equuli strain  <dig> and candidatus symbiobacter mobilis cr. in this way, we collected  <dig> real crispr clusters . reassuringly, almost all of these  real crisprs are found to have diverse spacers .table  <dig> characterization of the “crispr” clusters according to the cas genes and spacer diversity


descriptions of the columns: “% co-location” shows the percentage of crisprs co-locating with cas genes in each cluster; “d+” represents that crispr contains diverse spacers, whereas “d-” indicates no spacer diversity was observed; “short” represents short crisprs 




groups of putative crisprs that lack evidence  and are not similar to real crisprs , on the other hand, are likely to be the genomic elements that superficially reassemble the crispr’s repeat-spacer structure but are not real crisprs. as a result, we derived a total of  <dig> such elements, called false-crispr elements , from  <dig> clusters and  <dig> singletons of putative “crisprs”.

annotation of false-crispr elements
for each group of false-crisprs, we checked the spacer diversity of the “crisprs” in each group. further, we applied tandem repeat finder  <cit>  and repeatmask to check if a “crispr” is likely to be a tandem repeat or simple repeat due to the low complexity of dnas. we classified false-crisprs into four categories:  tandem repeats,  star-like elements,  simple repeats, and  unknown, for the crisprs that don’t fall into the other three categories . see fig.  <dig> for examples of the different categories, highlighting the differences of the different elements.fig.  <dig> an illustration of a typical crispr and other genomic elements that superficially reassemble the crispr’s repeat-spacer structure




tandem repeats
tandem repeats are the special sequences that are abundant in prokaryotic genomes. the region containing the tandem repeats is potentially hypermutable, which allows the bacteria to adapt to changing environments without increasing overall mutation rate  <cit> . the hypermutable tandem repeats may have very similar structure with crispr arrays. in total  <dig> out of  <dig>  false-crisprs  were predicted to be tandem repeats by tandem repeat finder  <cit> .

star-like elements
in the previous study, cramton et al.  <cit>  identified the staphylococcus aureus repeat  element, which contains the extraordinarily cg-rich repeats, and this repetitive element was found in up to  <dig> copies in a s. aureus genome. the structure of star-like elements could easily be confused with real crisprs. star-like elements contain the signature sequence ttgttgggccc  <cit> , we checked for this signature sequence in our collection of false-crisprs and found  <dig> of them contain this signature which were therefore classified as star-like elements.

simple repeats
we observed that some of the false-crisprs contain short  low-complexity repeats. using repeatmasker ,  <dig> false-crisprs were identified to contain the simple sets of dna repeats. for example, the false cripsr found in burkholderia pseudomallei  <dig>  contains  <dig> copies of sequence pattern gccgtt. six false-crisprs contain low complexity sequences, for example, the false-crispr in s. aureus tch <dig> , which is not star-like and tandem repeat, is identified as a-rich  and low complexity region.

real and false crisprs in s. aureus
in total,  <dig> crisprs  were identified by metacrt from 123 s. aureus complete genomes . six crisprs  are identified as real crisprs in our study. the  <dig> others are “false” crispr elements, among which  <dig> are tandem repeats, and  <dig> arrays are identified as star-like elements. in addition, we identified  <dig> real crisprs from s. aureus draft genomes, which far outnumbered the complete s. aureus genomes.

complete subtype iii-a crispr-cas systems were identified in three complete genomes  and two draft  genomes. crisprs are both found upstream and downstream of the cas locus in the same genome . other isolates share similar organization of the crispr–cas systems , but the length of the crisprs varies. the upstream crisprs contain between four  and  <dig>  repeats, and the downstream crisprs contain either four or five repeats. the two crisprs sandwiching the cas locus in s. aureus cig <dig>  share similar repeats but with similarity less than 90%, so they were grouped into two clusters . in addition to the two crisprs co-located with the cas locus, an orphan crispr was found in s. aureus cig <dig> which also shares similar repeat with the other two crisprs in this genome. we note that crisprs found in some isolates, including s. aureus  <dig> and s. aurues mshr  <dig>  share more similar repeats with s. epidermidis than s. aureus cig <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of the crisprs found in s. aureus. a the complete subtype iii-a crispr-cas systems identified in s. aureus 08ba <dig>  b the multiple alignments of all real crisprs grouped in seven clusters, using one representative repeat sequence for each cluster. s. aureus strain names are shown on the left. c the phylogenetic tree of the crisprs, built from the multiple alignment shown in . cig290a represents the repeat sequence in the orphan crispr in s. aureus cig <dig>  cig290b and cig290c represent the repeat sequence in the crisprs that are in the downstream and upstream of the cas locus in s. aureus cig <dig> , respectively. mshr1132a represents the repeat sequence in the orphan crispr in s. aureus mshr <dig>  whereas mshr1132b represents the repeat sequence in a crispr that is in the upstream of subtype iii-a cas locus 




notably, one of the false-crisprs we identified in s. aureus nctc <dig> was considered as a genuine crispr in a previous study  <cit>  which used high throughput rna-sequencing  to examine gene expression, including their predicted orphan “crispr”. in this s. aureus strain, we identified four false-crisprs including three star-like elements and one tandem repeat. one star-like element  was mistaken as a crispr in osmundson et al.  <cit>  . rna-seq reads were found covering all three star-like elements, including the one studied by osmundson et al.  <cit>  , suggesting that these elements were expressed. the tandem repeat is located between  <dig> – <dig>  bps within a protein-coding gene between  <dig> – <dig>  bps, which encodes for a fibrinogen-binding protein sdrc. this tandem repeat is found to be expressed , which is not surprising. however, the biological meaning of the other three false-crisprs  remains to be investigated.fig.  <dig> expression of false-crisprs found in s. aureus. the expression level of the elements was measured by reads per 25 bp per million total reads and the x-axis shows the position along the s. aureus  <dig> genome in nctc8325- <dig> , rn4220-prmc <dig>  and rn4220-prmc2-gp <dig>  cells. a the short crispr-like element, which was reported as a “crispr” in  <cit> . b the crispr-like element having overlap with a protein-coding gene is predicted to be tandem repeats. the regions containing star-like elements are represented by green lines. to evaluate the expression level of false-crisprs, we used tophat <dig>  <cit>  with default parameters to align the single-end reads, which were downloaded from ncbi sra , to the s. aureus nctc <dig> genome




false-crispr elements in existing collections of crisprs
since most existing methods for crispr identification are based on finding regions with repeat-and-spacer like structures, we expect to find false-crisprs in the collections of crisprs identified using these methods. we checked for presence of false-crisprs in biswas’ collection  <cit> , crisprbank  <cit> , crisprmap  <cit> , and the ncbi annotations  <cit> . because crisprmap only provides repeat sequences , we used similarity search to find false-crisprs in this collection: a repeat in crisprmap that shares 90% sequence identity, covering 90% of its length, with a false-crispr we identified is considered a potential false-crispr.

we found that  <dig> false-crisprs were collected in the early study conducted by biswas et al  <cit>  as crisprs, counting for  <dig> %  of their collection of predicted crisprs. among the  <dig> false-crisprs,  <dig> belong to tandem repeats, and  <dig> are star-like elements . we noticed that  <dig> out of the  <dig>  false-crisprs had only weak evidence of transcriptional direction prediction , an indirect evidence suggesting that they are unlikely to be real crisprs. we checked a more recent collection of crisprs from biswas et al  <cit> . among  <dig>  crisprs  collected in crisprbank ,  <dig>  are similar to false cripsrs, and most of them  were considered as weak predictions  by crisprdetect  <cit> . among  <dig> false-crisprs,  <dig> are identified as tandem repeats and  <dig> are classified as star-like elements .table  <dig> breakdown of the false-crisprs found in existing collections of crisprs




for the crisprmap  <cit>  collection,  <dig>  repeats are similar to false-crisprs, among which  <dig> and  <dig> are classified as tandem repeats and star-like elements, respectively . we further checked the crispr annotations provided by the ncbi  <cit>  which combined crt  <cit>  and piler-cr  <cit>  to predict cirpsrs, in archaeal and bacterial genomes. out of  <dig> crispr arrays  that were annotated in ncbi annotation files,  <dig>  could be identified as false-crisprs.

discussion
in this study, we provide an overview of the distribution of different types  of crispr-cas systems and also evaluate the crisprs and cas loci co-location tendency among currently available archaeal and bacterial complete genomes. our analysis has shown that isolated crisprs and cas loci could be the remnant of the non-functional crispr-cas systems, or they could function remotely with each other.

the existing, widely used crispr detection tools, such as crisprfinder  <cit>  and crt  <cit> , predict the crisprs primarily based on the typical structure of crisprs . however, this structure is easily confused with other kinds of elements such as tandem repeats, star-like elements and simple repeats. combing genomic context analysis and the diversity analysis of the “spacers,” we collected  <dig>  suspicious orphan crisprs, named false-crisprs.

although earlier simpler prediction methods  <cit>  will predict false positives, later methods  have lower levels of false positives . our results indicate that predictions of crispr solely based on the repeat-spacer structural patterns will pose a high risk of false positives, thus the use of additional information , proposed both in our study and recently developed approaches including crisprdetect  <cit> , could greatly improve real crispr identification. since about 50% of our false-crispr elements are identified as tandem repeats, we believe it is a useful step to run tandem repeat finder  <cit>  to filter out crispr predictions. our collection of false-crispr and their classifications can be utilized in further studies to reduce the false annotation of crispr.

there are still a significant number of false-crisprs  that remain unknown. we found that some repeat sequences of these unknown false-crisprs are extremely prevalent in their corresponding genomes, which may be caused by nucleotide composition bias. for example, false-crisprs found in the conexibacter woesei dsm  <dig> genome  and in the extremely low gc-content genome candidatus carsonella ruddii ht isolate thao <dig> genome  are likely to belong to this case. however, the unknown false-crisprs remain to be further investigated.

CONCLUSIONS
using available complete archaeal and bacterial genomes, we systematically studied isolated crisprs  and false-crisprs. we demonstrated that it is important to differentiate isolated and false-crisprs, and our curation of false-crisprs could be used to reduce the false annotation of crisprs, useful for improving the annotation of crispr–cas systems.
