BACKGROUND
turkey is a large and densely populated country . in turkey, tuberculosis remains an important public health concern with a case notification rate of  <dig> / <dig>  inhabitants in  <dig>  <cit> . in many of the studies, social aspect of tb is also underestimated. the men/women sex ratio shows a proportion much more important of men  than women which suffers from the disease. besides, the global drug resistance rates in men are twice higher than that of women. the 17– <dig> year group accounts for 80% of the studied strains, which shows that a young male population is specifically concerned by tuberculosis  <cit> . contrary to the picture of most european countries, where the last years have seen a tremendous amount of studies describing the population-based genetic structure of mycobacterium tuberculosis, no data of this kind are yet available for turkey, with the exception of a recent paper describing the diversity of phospholipases genes in  <dig> clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis  <cit> .

from a geographical, historical and anthropological aspect, turkey is a link between europe and asia, an early region of human settlement, located in the western part of eurasia  <cit> . various cultural and anthropological influences of early civilizations have left complex scars, making from turkey an anthropologically rich area. more evidence about the unique nature and complexity of human genetics in anatolia has been discovered, whether based on mitochondrial or on y chromosome diversity  <cit> . the existence of a hypothetical proto-indo-european language, whose link to anatolia appears likely, is another issue that reinforces the importance of turkey in human history, especially of the "indo-european" lineages  <cit> .

molecular characterization studies on m. tuberculosis in turkey until recently focused on the use of the "gold-standard" is6110-rflp method and on the description and characterization of multi-drug-resistance rates and their mechanisms, two issues of great importance for public-health  <cit> . however, to the best of our knowledge, no population-based data were available on the genetic diversity of m. tuberculosis in turkey. the goal of this study was to get an initial insight into the biodiversity of m. tuberculosis in turkey by studying a set of  <dig> dnas from anatolia by spoligotyping, a high throughput technique for which large polymorphism databases have been created  <cit> . these dnas originated from as many clinical isolates from tuberculosis patients resident in turkey. we show in this paper that a single genotype or "clonal complex"  accounts for one fourth of the total tb cases. a second genotype, st <dig>  may also bear some eastern mediterranean or asian specificity but remains to be more exhaustively investigated. the predominance of a specific clonal complex in turkey may argue in favour of a long-lasting presence of tuberculosis in this country and open new avenues of investigation to better understand why and how such a clone became predominant.

RESULTS
result of the genotyping analysis by spoligotyping
the global structure of the mycobacterium tuberculosis population by spoligotyping is shown on the figure  <dig>  our results provide a first raw information on the distribution of the spoligotypes within two cities of turkey. one spoligotype, st <dig>  is highly frequent. this spoligotype had already been detected in spoldb <dig> and designated as lam <dig>  given the absence of spacer 21– <dig> in this superfamily of genotypes  <cit> . another genotype, st <dig> , which remains undesignated for the time-being, is also frequent. we identified  <dig> different sts in the set of dnas originating from malatya  and  <dig> genotypes in the set of dnas originating in ankara . these results suggest that the genetic diversity in ankara is superior to the one found in malatya, which would be logical given that ankara is a larger city and the administrative capital of turkey. the data were further compared to the spoldb <dig> database  <cit> . nine spoligotypes from malatya were truly unique  whereas  <dig> were in cluster with other clinical isolates found in the database: st <dig> was created by match with a clinical isolate from sweden; st  <dig>  was created by a match between two clinical isolates t <dig> and t <dig>  which are presumed to be linked to st41; st <dig> was created by a match between two clinical isolates from turkey  and one from indonesia. the study shows that more than 58% of the patients in malatya and 38% in ankara, were gathered in only four different sts which are st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig> . it is likely that these tuberculosis genotypes are representative of strains that were introduced in turkey at a distant past. if we compare the distribution of these genotypes between the rest of the world and turkey, we note that st <dig> prevails largely in turkey  whereas st <dig> and st <dig> are distributed equally world-wide and in turkey. st <dig> is poorly prevalent in the world database  whereas highly frequent in our study, which also suggests a strong local phylogeographical specificity.

result of the genotypic analysis by is6110-rflp typing
the full results describing the complete molecular epidemiological analysis of the  <dig> clinical isolates, representative of as many patients from malatya will be reported elsewhere. however, when we looked at the is6110-rflp results on the isolates bearing st <dig>  we confirmed that most of them harbored a similar is <dig> pattern based on a 2-copy signature, at around  <dig>  kb and  <dig>  kb respectively . another subgroup of  <dig> clinical isolates harbored a slightly different 2-banded profile . the description of tb genotypes harboring two copies of is <dig> was already reported in previous studies  <cit> .

result of the genotypic analysis by miru-vntr typing
a total of  <dig> clinical isolates belonging to the st <dig> were further genotyped by miru-vntr typing. our aim was to apply this highly discriminant method to further distinguish between isolates with st <dig> spoligotypes. results are shown in table  <dig>  a main pattern, found in  <dig> clinical isolates was observed . another well represented variant pattern was found in  <dig> clinical isolates . when a minimum parsimonious tree was built by minimum spanning tree, a unique clonal complex was observed .

result of other databases search
the  <dig> pattern was introduced into the sitvit <dig> database . two isolates previously reported by l. cowan  and j. driscoll  bearing the same st <dig> spoligo and the same miru-vntr pattern were identified. this miru-vntr pattern was designated as vntr-international-type  number  <dig>  the second most represented allele  <dig> bore the vit number  <dig>  when the clinical isolates bearing this miru-vntr type value were compared to the is6110-rflp pattern of the same isolates , an homogenous cluster of four fully identical is6110-rflps with a double band at  <dig> – <dig>  kb was detected , thus suggesting the full linkage between the two markers.

when a search was made against another database, the new-york state spoligotyping database,  maintained at the wadworth center in albany, ny, we observed that st <dig>  was also found in  <dig> more clinical isolates in the usa, among which  <dig> were from turkish clinical isolates from the city of samsun, on the border of the black sea .

discussion
tuberculosis remains a great public health concern in turkey. the resistance to antituberculosis drugs, which represents a specific threat and as such deserves much attention, was recently the focus of many investigations in turkey  <cit> , however, molecular epidemiology is of more recent interest  <cit> . indeed, the unraveling of the effect of genetic variability of m. tuberculosis on the presentation of the disease remains a challenging poorly investigated issue, which consists in understanding why a strain may become prevalent in certain communities  <cit> . recent results obtained on the polymorphims of genes known to be involved in pathogenicity and virulence  may create a bridge between pathogenicity and population genetics studies  <cit> . however, the population-based genetic landscape of tuberculosis biodiversity was, to the best of our knowledge, unknown before this study and as such deserved such an attempt to define which genotypes are responsible of the tb cases in turkey, a subject which, given the highly complex anthropological structure of turkey, is of great interest for clinical scientists, bacteriologists, and evolutionary biologists.

a total of  <dig> dnas extracted from m. tuberculosis clinical isolates from tb turkish patients were genotyped by spoligotyping. a major genotype, as revealed by spoligotyping st <dig>  which misses spacer 20– <dig>  26– <dig> and 33– <dig>  and had been previously described under the designation of "lam7", represented up to one fourth of all tb isolates. when these genotypes were further investigated by is6110-rflp or by the highly discriminant miru-vntr technique, highly similar profiles were obtained suggesting that these strains define a true genotype family or clonal complex. this genotype is likely to be identical to the one described in table  <dig> by is6110-rflp and ptbn <dig> in a recent paper  <cit> . however, given the highly discriminative power of ptbn <dig> as a second genotyping method, and the difficulties to compare these patterns, a total of  <dig> subclusters were described initially . how these previous results correlate to miru-vntr-based or spoligotyping-based clustering remains to be further investigated.

the finding of another genotype st <dig> that was already detected in spoldb <dig> but without origin of potential phylogeographical specificity is intriguing. this genotype is currently under investigation and is also found to be present in bulgaria . whether this genotype also bears a larger eastern-mediterranean or middle eastern phylogeographical specificity remains speculative for the time-being.

the incidence of tuberculosis in turkey was recently estimated around  <dig>  new cases per  <dig>  inhabitants  <cit> . for a city such as malatya , which has a slightly superior incidence , the total estimated number of new cases per year would be n =  <dig>  thus, our sampling  represents the equivalent of a quarter of a two-year recruitment, which, we assume, is fully representative of the genetic diversity in malatya. in ankara, for which the recruitment was less important, similar genotyping results were obtained. in a third city from the border of the black sea , similar results were also obtained on  <dig> dnas by an independent team . thus the genotyping results obtained in ankara and malatya seems to be quite representative of anatolia, suggesting that the st41/vit <dig> and st41/vit <dig> could represent traces of a contemporary and/or historically endemic/epidemic clone in anatolia. if further investigations on isolates from the aegean, mediterranean and eastern sides of turkey confirm the prevalence of the st <dig> genotype, and provided that it is really ancient, one may expect that its distribution will vary depending on the human population structure in turkey. thus, the observed geographical variations in the frequency distribution of st <dig> may allow to precisely define its presumed origin. however one should be extremely cautious with such historical inferences. indeed, one should not forget that epidemics by their bursting nature, may rapidly promote the replacement of genotypes by others and that recent human migrations do complexify the issue  <cit> . turkey is a country where ancient central asian and european civilizations can be seen. preliminary phylogenetical results  suggest that the lam7-tur genotype family of m. tuberculosis may be related to the large lam <dig> superfamily of genotypes; however, another spoligotype, st <dig>  could also be the ancestor type of st <dig> and cannot be excluded at this step as a potential ancestor of st <dig>  further studies using combined miru-vntr-spoligotyping will facilitate the finding of the ancestor clone of the lam7-tur family.

CONCLUSIONS
we described a new phylogeographically-specific clone of m. tuberculosis, designated lam7-tur. further investigations to assess its frequency within all regions of turkey and its phylogeographical origin and phylogenetic position within the global m. tuberculosis phylogenetic tree will shed new light on its endemicity in asia minor.
