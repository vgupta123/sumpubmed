BACKGROUND
the polyfructan inulin is considered to act as a prebiotic, since it can modulate the composition and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota, which might potentially enhance the health of the host organism  <cit> . several studies have demonstrated that inulin can modulate the intestinal microbiota in pigs. in particular, bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were increased in different segments of the intestinal tract, when inulin was added in a concentration of  <dig> %  <cit>  and 4%  <cit>  to the diets. moreover, a decrease of clostridium perfringens in the porcine digesta of the colon and rectum  <cit>  or clostridium spp. and members of enterobacteriaceae in the porcine digesta and mucus in different segments of the intestine  <cit>  was reported after the dietary inclusion of inulin. these results are conflicting, as other studies could not demonstrate an effect of dietary inulin on the intestinal microbiota in piglets  <cit> .

to our best knowledge, no studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary inulin in gestating and lactating sows. however, this aspect might be interesting, since a modulation of the intestinal microbiota of the mother sows might also affect the bacterial community in the intestinal tract of their piglets. this sow-piglet-axis is particularly relevant, since the physiological condition of suckling piglets is closely connected with the mother sows in the first weeks of life, including energy and nutrient supply  <cit> , immunological protection  <cit>  and the microbial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that a probiotic treatment of sows altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota in their offspring  <cit> . however, no study has evaluated the potential of prebiotics with regard to the sow-piglet-axis up to now.

it was the aim of the present study to determine the effects of dietary inulin on the composition and metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota of gestating and lactating sows and their suckling piglets.

discussion
the physiological condition of suckling piglets is substantially influenced by their mother sows. besides the intake of colostrum and milk for delivering energy, nutrients, and, importantly, passive immunity, the close contact between sows and suckling piglets is of relevance for the microbial colonisation of the gastrointestinal tract of the newborns. in particular, the contact with mother’s faeces contributes to this microbial colonisation in their offspring  <cit> , and it can be hypothesised that a nutritional modulation of the intestinal microbiota of mother sows also affects the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract of their suckling piglets. this link between the intestinal microbiota of sows and piglets has already been demonstrated after a probiotic treatment of mother sows  <cit> , however, to our best knowledge, the potential of prebiotics has not been evaluated in this context up to now.

the present results demonstrated that dietary inulin increased the cell numbers of enterococci in sows’ faeces during the gestation and lactation period . moreover, a higher cell number of enterococci was also measured in the caecal digesta of the suckling piglets of the inulin treated sows , stressing the connection between the composition of the intestinal microbiota of mothers and their offspring. it should not go unmentioned that previous studies demonstrated decreased numbers of enterococci in the faeces of growing pigs  <cit>  respectively in the colonic digesta of newly weaned piglets  <cit>  when inulin was added to the diets. however, due to the higher cell numbers of enterococci at all measuring time points of the present study, a systematically enhancing effect of dietary inulin on the numbers of enterococci in sows can be assumed.

except for the numbers of enterococci, the bacterial groups in the faeces of the sows were not affected by the dietary inclusion of inulin . in particular, no differences in the cell numbers of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were observed between the control and inulin group, which is in contrast to previous studies  <cit> . bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are typically anticipated to be increased by the dietary inclusion of inulin  <cit> . however, the missing effect in the present study underlines other conflicting results reported in the literature, as some authors also could not demonstrate an effect of dietary inulin on bifidobacteria and lactobacilli  <cit>  or generally on the intestinal microbiota in pigs  <cit> .

interestingly, not only the cell numbers of enterococci, but also of some other bacterial groups in the digesta of the stomach and caecum of the suckling piglets differed depending on the dietary treatment of the mother sows. higher cell numbers of eubacteria  and c. leptum , but lower cell numbers of enterobacteria and l. amylovorus  were detected in the inulin group when compared to the control group . up to now, the reason for this observation remains unclear. as environmental conditions were kept similar between the inulin and control group and no additional feed was offered to the suckling piglets, exogenous factors might be excluded. in general, it should be considered that the study design did not allow an evaluation of digesta samples of the sows, particularly samples of the stomach or caecum, why comparisons between the gastrointestinal microbiota of the sows and piglets are limited. it might be that inulin also affected further bacterial groups in the gastrointestinal tract of the sows, but that the analysis of the faeces cannot completely reflect this dietary impact on the microbiota.

another explanation for the differences between the faecal microbiota of the sows and the gastrointestinal microbiota of the suckling piglets might be individual differences in the intestinal bacterial cell counts of the sows prior to the dietary inulin treatment. this factor was also assumed in the study of starke et al.  <cit> , where a probiotic enterococcus faecium strain not only affected the bacterial cell numbers in the faeces of mother sows. the authors  <cit>  also observed differences in the intestinal microbiota of suckling piglets, when the offspring of the probiotic and non-probiotic treated sows was compared. however, the probiotic enterococcus faecium strain did not modify the intestinal microbiota of sows and piglets in an equal manner.

only small effects of dietary inulin on the metabolic activity of the intestinal microbiota of sows and piglets were observed. however, the composition of the microbiota and the concentrations of the microbial metabolites in the faeces of the sows markedly differed depending on the reproductive stage. the bacterial cell counts were often reduced on day  <dig> p.p. compared to the days  <dig> a.p. and  <dig> p.p. significant differences  were demonstrated for eubacteria, lactobacilli, l. reuteri, l. amylovorus, l. johnsonii, l. mucosae, c. leptum, and c. coccoides in both groups. the reduced numbers of bacteria could be due to a lower feed intake before and after farrowing, which is commonly found in practice and was also observed in the present study. time-dependent changes were also detected for the concentrations of the bacterial metabolites in the faeces of the sows. higher concentrations of lactate  and propionic acid  were measured on day  <dig> a.p. compared to the days  <dig> and  <dig> p.p., and lower concentrations of acetic acid  were detected on day  <dig> a.p. compared to the days  <dig> and  <dig> p.p. the total concentrations of scfa  and the amounts of ammonia  were high on day  <dig> a.p., decreased until day  <dig> p.p. and subsequently increased until day  <dig> p.p. overall, it can be concluded that the faecal microbiota of the sows might be affected by changes in the feeding regimen during the parturition time, and adapted to increasing intakes of the lactation diet during the first days after farrowing.

CONCLUSIONS
the present results indicate that the addition of inulin to a gestation and lactation diet can not only modulate the intestinal microbiota of sows, but also of their offspring. a promotion or stabilization of the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract of suckling piglets might especially be beneficial with regard to the critical weaning time, which should be investigated in future studies.
