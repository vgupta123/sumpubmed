BACKGROUND
endosperm chalkiness is a varietal characteristic that negatively affects not only the appearance and milling properties but also the cooking texture and palatability of cooked rice  <cit> . chalky grains have a lower density of starch granules compared to vitreous ones, and are therefore more prone to breakage during milling  <cit> . in many rice-producing areas, high chalkiness is a major concern that decreases grain quality. in china, many early-season indica and japonica varieties are of high grain endosperm chalkiness and their market values are seriously affected  <cit> . therefore, one of the goals in rice breeding is to reduce chalkiness in rice varieties.

in rice grains, starch is the predominant storage substance that account for over 80% of the total dry mass. starch in rice endosperm is composed of relatively unbranched amylose  and highly branched amylopectin . recent work showed that multiple factors contribute to the formation of grain chalkiness, including starch synthesis, starch granule structure and arrangement  <cit> . for example, mutations in the wx  gene  and its regulator dull cause low amylose content  and hence whole opaque endosperm  <cit> . the amylose-extender mutant has reduced activity of branching enzyme ii , causing alteration in the fine structure of grain amylopectin  <cit> . the flo- <dig> floury endosperm mutant harbors mutations affecting rice branching enzyme i  activity  <cit> . the floury endosperm- <dig> mutant and the sugary- <dig> mutant are defective in pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase  and debranching enzymes  activity respectively  <cit> .

the formation of grain chalkiness can also be influenced by various external stresses during the grain-filling stage. temperatures higher than 26°c, for example, could easily cause chalky appearance and a reduction in grain weight  <cit> . microscopic observation showed that, compared with the translucent portion of rice endosperm that ripened under normal temperature which were filled with densely packed and polygonal granules, the chalky portion of high temperature-ripened grains were loosely packed with elliptical-shaped starch granules containing air spaces which caused random light reflection and hence chalky appearance  <cit> . these observations demonstrated that environmental stresses represent another major cause for grain chalkiness in rice. furthermore, imaging on endosperm amyloplast development of various japonica and indica rice lines indicated that starch synthesis in the rice grain may involve complicated genetic networks  <cit> . previous studies have detected many major quantitative trait loci  that may underlie chalkiness in rice  <cit> , however; only few qtls have been isolated and functionally analyzed  <cit> . thus, the molecular mechanisms underlying the formation of rice grain endosperm chalkiness still remain poorly understood.

in this study, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of the caryopses of a near-isogenic line cssl50- <dig>  and its low chalkiness parental line asominori. corroborated with the phenotypic and physico-biochemical observations, our genome-wide transcription analysis supports the notion that rice grain endosperm development is controlled by a delicate, but complex genetic network. notably, several pathways related to signal transduction, cell rescue/defense, transcription, protein degradation, carbohydrate metabolism and redox homeostasis were found to be predominant among the differentially expressed genes.

RESULTS
phenotypic and physiochemical properties of asominori and cssl50- <dig> grains
cssl50- <dig> is derived from the near-isogenic line cssl <dig> with a small substituted segment of chromosome  <dig> from the original donor ir <dig> in the largely asominori background  <cit> . cssl50- <dig> displays high chalkiness under normal field conditions whereas its parental line asominori has normal grains. therefore, cssl50- <dig> represents an ideal genetic material with relatively stabilized genetic background suitable for exploring the molecular mechanism of chalkiness formation.

cssl50- <dig> grains display higher chalkiness with less translucence, when compared with its parental line asominori . scanning electron microscopy showed that the chalky endosperm is comprised of round and loosely packed starch granules with large air spaces, in contrast to the translucent asominori grains that are filled with densely packed granules . cssl50- <dig> grains have a higher content of short-chain amylopectins , but less medium  or long  amylopectin chains . this observation is consistent with the rapid visco analyzer  profile which provides a comprehensive evaluation of the grain quality . the relatively lower ratio of medium or long chain amylopectin in cssl50- <dig> is correlated with the higher breakdown frequency of its starch granule when heated, indicating that the importance of the fine structure of amylopectin in normal starch granule appearance and degree of grain chalkiness  <cit> . overall, cssl50- <dig> has a higher percentage of grain with chalkiness , chalkiness percentages, degree of endosperm chalkiness , starch content, amylose content, sucrose content and protein content when compared with asominori . these results collectively indicate that the occurrence of grain chalkiness is associated with changes in starch granule shape, amylopectin chain-length profiles, amylose and protein content, and rva profile characteristics.

increased grain-filling rate and enhanced activities of starch enzymes in cssl50-1
the observation that cssl50- <dig> grains are high in short-chain amylopectin, but low in medium and long ones suggest that the grain-filling rate at early stage of grain development may be faster in cssl50- <dig> than in asominori. we thus measured the fresh and dry grain weight at several grain-filling stages  for cssl50- <dig> and asominori. the results indeed showed that grain-filling rate at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> daf is faster in cssl50- <dig> than that in asominori . in contrast, asominori exhibits a smooth and steady grain-filling course. these results suggest that the faster grain-filling pace before  <dig> daf in cssl50- <dig> could be an important contributing factor for the formation of chalkiness at the later stage of endosperm development. this notion is consistent with a previous study showing that a steady grain-filling rate is required for prevention of chalkiness in rice endosperm  <cit> . unexpectedly, no significant changes were detected in photosynthesis efficiency in cssl50- <dig> rice leaves during 10- <dig> daf of the grain filling stage, suggesting that photosynthesis efficiency is not tightly linked with chalkiness formation in rice grains .

since grains of cssl50- <dig> contain higher starch, amylose and sucrose contents compared with asominori, we speculated that enzymes involved in starch synthesis might be more robust in cssl50- <dig> than in asominori. to confirm this, the enzymatic activities of four major enzymes involved in grain starch synthesis were measured during the first  <dig> days after flowering. similar patterns were observed for susy in cssl50- <dig> and asominori, namely, its highest activity was detected at  <dig> daf, and its lowest activity detected at  <dig> daf . however, susy activity in cssl50- <dig> was higher than that in asominori at the  <dig> and  <dig> daf. similarly, at  <dig> daf, agpase, sbe and dbe activities were significantly higher in cssl50- <dig> compared to those in asominori . additionally, enzyme activities of susy at  <dig> daf and dbe at  <dig> daf were found to be lower in cssl50- <dig> than those in asominori . these results indicate that  <dig> daf is a critical time point for grain filling when many enzymes involved in starch synthesis exhibit maximum activities. we therefore used rnas extracted from  <dig> daf endosperms for subsequent microarray analysis.

transcriptome analysis of  <dig> daf caryopses of cssl50- <dig> and asominori
to investigate the underlying molecular basis for chalky endosperm formation, we used affymetrix genechips for a global transcriptome profiling analysis . a total of  <dig> transcripts were found to be differentially expressed between cssl50- <dig> and asominori with fdr ≤5% using the significance analysis of microarray  software. among these,  <dig> transcripts differ more than  <dig>  fold and  <dig> transcripts differ more than  <dig>  fold between asominori and cssl50- <dig>  fisher's exact test showed that  <dig> functional terms in biological process and two molecular function terms were significantly enriched among these genes . interesting categories that may be involved in rice endosperm development were carbohydrate metabolism, response to stress, transcription, hydrolase activity, and oxidoreductase activity. gene ontology  annotation of the  <dig> transcripts with ≥ <dig> fold change was listed in additional file  <dig> . genes in carbohydrate metabolism includes glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, alpha-amylase, and glycosyl hydrolases family  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> proteins. genes of the oxidoreductase activity group includes l-ascorbate peroxidase  <dig>  glutathione s-transferase, peroxidase  <dig>  and monodehydroascorbase reductase that are known to be involved in redox homeostasis. transcription factors include genes encoding one myb-like dna-binding domain containing protein, two ap <dig> domain proteins, one homeobox domain protein and one gaf domain containing protein. the functions of a large number of genes were classified as primary metabolic process, including genes encoding a u-box domain containing protein and an ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase that may be involved in protein degradation, several protein kinases for signaling transduction, two leucine-rich repeat family proteins that may be associated with defense response. these observations suggest that intricate a gene network may underlie the proper development of rice grain endosperms. to further improve the stringency, we applied one-way anova analysis on the differentially expressed genes identified by sam. this analysis identified  <dig> statistically differentially expression genes . following the functional categories given by go and the bioinformatics tool jafa http://jafa.burnham.org, we manually classified these genes into  <dig> major categories, including signal transduction, cell rescue/defense, transcription, protein degradation, carbohydrate metabolism, redox homeostasis, amino acid metabolism, cell cycle/biogenesis, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, substance transport, protein folding and transport, protein biosynthesis, organ development, energy pathway, rna processing, photosynthesis, and plant hormone biosynthesis . consistent with what we observed in go analysis ,  <dig> % of these genes belong to the first six functional groups , suggesting that the occurrence of endosperm chalkiness in rice might be closely related to these functional and regulatory pathways. in addition, only three genes associated with photosynthesis were differentially expressed between asominori and cssl50- <dig> , implying that photosynthesis efficiency may not play a significant role in the formation of chalkiness in rice.

enhanced sucrose and starch synthesis vs. disrupted cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin metabolism in cssl50-1
physio-biochemical analysis of chalky rice endosperm indicated that the change in starch composition is a major difference between chalky and non-chalky rice grains . go analysis also showed that genes associated with carbohydrate metabolism are significantly represented among the differentially expressed transcripts. as shown in additional file  <dig> , more than  <dig> genes are annotated to be associated with carbohydrate metabolism. of particular interest were several key genes that are known to be directly involved in the synthesis of starch and cell-wall related polysaccharides .

a closer examination of these carbohydrate metabolism genes revealed that the differentially expressed genes in cssl50- <dig> were in favor of enhancing sucrose, amylose, and amylopectin synthesis. as shown in figure  <dig>  two genes, sucrose phosphatase  and sucrose phosphate synthase  that directly catalyze sucrose synthesis, are up-regulated, whereas the enzyme β-fructofuranosidase that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose is down-regulated. the potentially accumulated sucrose , catalyzed by the reversible enzymatic activity of sucrose synthase  , may increase the concentration of udp-glucose, which can be converted into glucose-1-phosphate and subsequently converted into adp-glucose for starch synthesis. microarray data also revealed several additional enzymes that are up-regulated in cssl50- <dig> for the accumulation of adp-glucose:  up-regulation of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase to promote fructose-6-phosphate to glucose-6-phosphate conversion;  down-regulation of udp-glucose 4-epimerase to reduce conversion of udp-glucose to udp-galactose;  up-regulation of phosphoglycerate kinase and down-regulation of phosphoglycerate mutase for the accumulation of 3-phosphoglycerate, an activator for adp-glucose pyrophosphorylase that converts glucose-1-phosphate to adp-glucose  <cit> . in addition, several enzymes are regulated to promote starch component synthesis:  up-regulation of a gene encoding a protein of the glycosyltransferae family  <dig> for increased amylose content;  up-regulation of starch branching enzyme and starch debranching enzyme that promote amylopectin elongation and branching;  down-regulation of α-amylase and glycosyl hydrolase family  <dig> protein to reduce starch degradation to malto-oligosaccharide. therefore, the enhanced enzymatic activities for sucrose and starch synthesis correlate with the high content of sucrose, amylose, and starch in cssl50- <dig> 

in cssl50- <dig>  the enhancement of sucrose and starch  seems to be accompanied by a metabolic disorder of cell wall related polysaccharides. first, two cellulose synthase genes were down-regulated which may reduce cellulose synthesis; second, up-regulation of α-l-arabinofuranosidase and α-d-xylosidase and down-regulation of an xylanase inhibitor protein may promote hydrolysis of hemicellulose  <cit> . these observations seem to suggest that the enhancement of sucrose and starch synthesis is at the cost of cell wall related non-storage polysaccharides in cssl50- <dig>  such carbohydrate metabolism disorders may significantly contribute to the endosperm chalkiness during grain ripening.

increased expression of redox genes and a higher level ros homeostasis in cssl50-1
previous studies showed that rice grains develop chalkiness under adverse environmental conditions such as high temperatures  <cit> . go analysis also indicated significant enrichment in oxidoreductase activity in molecular function . about  <dig> genes fell in the category of redox homeostasis in our manual classification of differentially expressed genes . since reactive oxygen species  are well known to be involved in various stress responses, we first measured the concentration of h2o <dig>  a common ros, in cssl50- <dig> and asominori. the results showed that the  <dig> daf grains of cssl50- <dig> contained much higher h2o <dig> concentration  than that in asominori  . such an imbalance in ros concentrations and its consequence may contribute to the development of chalkiness in grain endosperm at later developmental stages.

our microarray analysis revealed that the major enzyme responsible for converting free radicals to h2o <dig>  the superoxide dismutase  gene, is up-regulated  <dig>  fold in cssl50- <dig>  genes encoding five other enzymes involved in h2o <dig> clearance, such as peroxiredoxin , ascorbate peroxidase , monodehydroascorbate reductase , and peroxiredoxin , are also up-regulated, except for two glutaredoxin genes . additionally, four genes involved in oxidized product clearance are regulated in favor of maintaining a homeostasis of these deleterious molecules in cssl50- <dig>  these are glutathione-s-transferase , glyoxalase , lipoxygenase- <dig> , and thioredoxin  . these enzymes function to remove oxidized proteins and lipids  <cit> . together, these observations suggest a close correlation between ros homeostasis and grain chalkiness.

a delicate but complicated gene network may underlie chalky rice grain formation
additional file  <dig>  lists the genes that were differentially expressed between cssl50- <dig> and asominori. in addition to those involved in starch and redox homeostasis that have been detailed above, genes involved in additional biological processes such as cell rescue/defense, hormone response, and protein biosynthesis and degradation are also differentially expressed between cssl50- <dig> and asominori. it is noteworthy that most genes involved in these pathways did not change significantly in terms of fold changes. such a result, however, is similar to a previous cdna array study of grain chalkiness under high temperature  <cit> . the subtle change in gene expression and the significant consequence in endosperm chalkiness formation seems to suggest that rice grain filling is a fine-tuned process which can be easily affected by genetic variations as well as fluctuations in environmental conditions. we therefore depicted a possible gene network according to the microarray data. as shown in figure  <dig>  in addition to the enhanced carbohydrate metabolisms for starch and suppressed non-starch polysaccharides and an elevated ros homeostasis, changes of gene expression levels in four additional pathways may also play roles in chalkiness formation of rice grains:  genes that are known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses, encoding those such as the nb-arc domain containing proteins, the leucine rich repeat family proteins and harpin-induced proteins, as well as heavy metal binding proteins and proteins involved in wound, senescence, light, uv and other stress responses;  genes involved in ros signaling such as phospholipase d, phosphatases, ca2+/ca2+-binding protein, g-proteins, and ras proteins;  hormone biosynthesis and signaling related genes, such as auxin, br , ga , ethylene  and cytokinin ;  genes involved in protein synthesis, such as those encoding ribosomal s <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  l10a- <dig> and l <dig> subunits and alanyl-, aspartyl-, lysyl-, phenylalanyl-trna synthetases and degradation, such as those encoding f-box, protease, peptidase, oligopeptidase, carboxy-peptidase, c-terminal hydrolase and transamidase. therefore, the formation of grain chalkiness likely involves alterations in multiple biological processes and multiple genetic pathways.

for confirmation,  <dig> transcripts were randomly chosen for semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis. the rt-pcr results correlate well with the microarray data, thus validating our microarray data .

discussion
cssl50- <dig> is an ideal material for exploring the molecular basis of rice grain chalkiness
grain endosperm chalkiness is a complex quantitative genetic trait and is controlled by multiple factors  <cit> . previous studies showed that there are as many as  <dig> qtls that may contribute to the percentages of grains with chalkiness  and degrees of endosperm chalkiness. these genes spread among  <dig> rice chromosomes as being located using seven different genetic populations  <cit> . in addition to genetic factors, rice grains are also sensitive to various environmental stresses and will easily form chalky endosperms under adverse conditions. changes in temperature and light, for example, are most effective at the milky stage of grain filling  <cit> . meanwhile, conditions of water and nutrient in the field also play important roles on grain chalkiness  <cit> .

despite its economic importance, only few genes have been functionally identified to be associated with endosperm chalkiness. this analysis, together with a previous transcriptome analysis on chalkiness formation under higher temperature  <cit> , has identified a set of differentially expressed genes that may contribute to endosperm chalkiness. the identified candidate genes may serve as excellent starting materials for dissecting the pathway controlling rice endosperm development at the molecular level. notably, most of these genes identified in this study belong to six major categories including cell rescue/defense, free radical clearance and redox homeostasis, signal transduction, hormone response, protein biosynthesis and degradation, and carbohydrate metabolism. our data also showed that, similar to the effect of high temperature, expression of numerous genes was affected under this genetic background, but surprisingly, quite a few of these genes were oppositely regulated in cssl50- <dig> when compared with the effect under the high temperature conditions. thus, the use of a genetically stabilized line for endosperm chalkiness study is complementary to the previous physical stress-based studies and should provide novel information regarding the molecular mechanism for chalky endosperm formation in rice.

enhanced starch synthesis causes imbalanced starch composition in cssl50-1
previously, chalky grains were found to have lower starch content  <cit> . for cssl50- <dig>  its grains contain higher percentage of sucrose, amylose, starch, and even protein content when compared with the normal rice cultivar asominori. enzymes, such as susy, agpase, sbe and dbe, exhibit higher activities at  <dig> daf in cssl50- <dig>  correlating with the higher expression levels of corresponding genes that were detected in our microarray data. since the shape and the arrangement of starch granule are closely related to endosperm chalkiness in rice  <cit> , it is reasonable to conclude that a coordinated and balanced action of starch synthetic enzymes are critical to the prevention of chalky endosperm formation.

endosperm development is a process of proper starch composition and accumulation  <cit> . gradual and smooth grain filling pace is required to form normal, translucent grains as seen in asominori. cssl50- <dig> has a higher grain-filling rate which may give insufficient time for long chain amylopectin to be synthesized, resulting in a relative higher percentage of short chain amylopectin  when compared with asominori. consistent with our results, the decrease of 10- <dig> dp amylopectin was also observed when rice grains ripened under high temperatures  <cit> . this is in line with our findings that both gene expression and the enzymatic activity of dbe are increased in cssl50- <dig>  interestingly, the synthesis of non-starch polysaccharides appears to be significantly retarded because of the down regulation of related genes such as cellulose synthase and the up-regulation of genes for degrading hemicellulose and pectin. therefore, the synthesis of cell wall related sugar might be sacrificed in cssl50- <dig>  in light of the importance of normal synthesis of starch and related polysaccharides, it is very likely that disorders in the enzyme activity and the expression of genes responsible for these events are among the major causes for endosperm chalkiness in cssl50- <dig> 

potential roles of ros in rice grain chalkiness formation
reactive oxygen species  are partially reduced forms of atmospheric oxygen . they typically result from the excitation of o <dig> to form singlet oxygen  or from the transfer of one, two or three electrons to o <dig> to form, respectively, a superoxide radical , hydrogen peroxide  or a hydroxyl radical   <cit> . among them, h2o <dig> is one of the most stable ros  <cit> . with both reducing and oxidizing properties, h2o <dig> has effects on almost all organisms, and can influence the life of every single cell. on one hand, h2o <dig> is highly reactive and toxic, and can lead to oxidative destruction of cells; on the other hand, it acts as a signaling molecule in regulating cell growth and development, cell proliferation, cell stress response, and signal transduction  <cit> . when accumulated at high enough concentrations, h2o <dig> can directly or indirectly oxidize enough of the cellular ascorbic acid and glutathione pool to alter the overall redox state of the cells. such high concentrations of h2o <dig> can also damage a large variety of biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and nucleic acids that are essential for the activity and integrity of the cells  <cit> . as sessile organisms, plants have evolved a high degree of developmental plasticity to optimize their growth and reproduction in response to various biotic and abiotic stresses  <cit> . under these conditions, the excessive h2o <dig> is efficiently scavenged by various antioxidative defense mechanisms in plant cells. the major ros-scavenging enzymes include ascorbate peroxidase , catalase , superoxide dismutase , glutathione peroxidase , monodehydroascorbate reductase , glutaredoxin  and peroxiredoxin . together with the antioxidants ascorbic acid and glutathione, these enzymes provide plant cells with highly efficient machinery for detoxifying h2o <dig> and other ros  <cit> .

in the present study, the expression levels of five genes involved in reactive oxygen species production and hemeostasis including superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase , monodehydroascorbate reductase  and peroxiredoxin  were found to be higher in cssl50- <dig> than those in asominori , suggesting that the antioxidative network in cssl50- <dig> is activated. this result is consistent with the higher concentration of h2o <dig> in cssl50- <dig>  in the 15th day of grain-filling period, the concentration of h2o <dig> in cssl50- <dig> reached  <dig> umol/g whereas that in asominori is only  <dig>  umol/g. the high concentration of h2o <dig> can provoke the defense system responsive to ros  stress in cssl50- <dig> to induce the expression of these antioxidative genes . unexpectedly, another one antioxidative gene  was found to be down-regulated in cssl50- <dig> compared to asominori , possibly due to more gsh to be needed for enhancing the functions of gst and glx genes .

in this study, we also found that the expression levels of gst, glx and trx genes are significantly higher in cssl50-1compared to those in asominori . in contrast, lox gene is down-regulated in cssl50- <dig> . gst is an antioxidative protein together with glutathione  to reduce oxidized biological macromolecule, and its expression can be strongly enhanced by abiotic and biotic stresses  <cit> . glyoxalase i can convert toxic 2-oxoaldehydes into less reactive 2-hydroxyacids using gsh as a cofactor  <cit> . thioredoxin  can reduce the oxidized proteins and peroxidative lipids  <cit> . however, lipoxygenase  <dig>  is one member of a family of enzymes that deoxygenate unsaturated fatty acids, thus initiating lipoperoxidation of membranes  <cit> . these results suggest that the antioxidative level in cssl50- <dig> is higher than that in asominori.

grain chalkiness involves coordinated regulation of multiple pathways
it has been known for a long time that adverse environmental conditions can easily cause chalkiness in rice grain. high-temperatures, for example, have been shown to cause changes in the expression of genes involved in starch synthesis and directly correlated with the extent of gains chalkiness  <cit> . drought stress, as well as sulphur deficiency which also activates antioxidation-related enzymes, can cause increased sucrose synthase activity and finally lead to the emergence of chalkiness too  <cit> . the reported studies show that exterior coercive conditions can break the oxidation-reduction balance, causing the change of carbohydrate metabolization in the rice plant, leading finally to the emergence of chalkiness. for example, 1) high-temperature stress can not only cause the change in the expression quantity of antioxidation-related genes, but also lead to the change in the expression quantity of carbon metabolism-related radical/protein, finally increasing the rice chalkiness  <cit>  . 2) drought and coldness coercive conditions can also change the expression levels of carbon metabolization-related genes in the rice plant  <cit>  . drought stress can also induce increase of sucrose synthase in the rice plant, finally leading to the emergence of chalkiness  <cit> , which agrees with the result of this experiment; namely, the sucrose synthase activity and seed grain filling rate in high-chalkiness cssl50- <dig> are remarkably higher than that in low-chalkiness asominori. 3) for the rice plant with outside trauma treatment, salt stress, and ray irradiation, except the activation of cell-defense related genes, the expression quantity of carbon-metabolization related genes is also changed  <cit> . 4) sulphur-deficiency can also bring about nutrition coercion of the rice plant, causing an increase in the activity of the rice's antioxidation-related enzymes, further leading to the emergence of rice chalkiness  <cit> .

reactive oxygen species , as represented by their most stable form h2o <dig>  <cit> , play important roles as signaling molecules in regulating plant growth and development including cell proliferation, cell stress response, and signal transduction  <cit> . h2o <dig> is known to be involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses. the observed drastic increase in h2o <dig> levels in cssl50- <dig> and the differential expression of several key regulatory genes involved on ros production and scavenge collectively suggest that ros may play a critical role in regulating rice endosperm chalkiness. changes in h2o <dig> levels may affect multiple metabolism pathways in the rice endosperm, causing chalkiness phenotypic change. further genetic and biochemical studies should further test such a possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
consistent with previous studies on the effect of adverse environmental conditions in causing chalky rice grain, our comparative transcriptome analysis of the caryopses of a near-isogenic line cssl50- <dig>  and its low chalkiness parental line asominori supports the notion that rice grain endosperm development is controlled by delicate, but complex genetic networks. notably, several pathways related to signal transduction, cell rescue/defense, transcription, protein degradation, carbohydrate metabolism and redox homeostasis were found to be predominant among the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that formation of rice endosperm chalkiness may involve coordinated regulation of multiple pathways. further refining of cssl50- <dig> as a useful genetic material will help eventual cloning and engineering the major genes underlying the formation of rice grain chalkiness.
