BACKGROUND
a typical neuron receives thousands of synaptic contacts  <cit> , and each postsynaptic site can express a number of neurotransmitter receptors. since neurons integrate signals from all receptors on their surface, their activity is determined by receptor sets and not by individual receptors.

functional receptor groups explain why a constitutive null-mutation of a neurotransmitter receptor often produces a mild phenotype, even when the receptor is known to be important in specific brain functions  <cit> . such minor functional effects can be explained by compensatory mechanisms in the developing brain, which at least partially depend on receptors that detect other neurotransmitters  <cit> .

similarly, the absence of an entire neurotransmitter may not have a major effect on brain development and function. serotonin  is an extremely abundant neurotransmitter in the brain: by some estimates, the density of serotonergic varicosities in the rat cerebral cortex is around 6·106/mm <dig>  with each cortical neuron receiving some  <dig> varicosities  <cit> . the density of serotonergic projections may exceed that of the brain capillary system  <cit>  and must carry a significant energetic cost. however, genetic mutations and pharmacological manipulations that eliminate virtually all 5-ht in the brain produce only subtle behavioral alterations, with no gross morphological or cellular changes  <cit> . abnormally low dopamine levels in the brain can be nearly asymptomatic until around 50-80% of the substantia nigra neurons are lost  <cit> , and ablation of dopaminergic neurons in neonatal rats does not result in any significant motor dysfunctions  <cit> . a lack of norepinephrine due to a genetic mutation in the dopamine-β-hydroxylase gene produces an unremarkable neurological phenotype in humans  <cit> . mammalian thalamic nuclei can function normally in the virtual absence of gabaergic interneurons, as has been shown in mice and rats  <cit> . experimental evidence shows that the lack of one neurotransmitter can be compensated for by changes in other neurotransmitters: for example, serotonergic processes have been shown to permanently extend into brain areas previously occupied by dopaminergic terminals  <cit> , and serotonin and/or dopamine may compensate for the lack of norepinephrine  <cit> . it should be noted that at least some adult neurons have the flexibility to switch from one neurotransmitter to another in response to the environment  <cit> .

these findings suggest that biological information in the brain is coded not by individual neurotransmitters or their receptors, but by finely-tuned neurotransmitter-receptor sets. while this hypothesis does not require that the receptors be physically linked, it is supported by the unexpected abundance of heteromeric receptor complexes  <cit> . for example, the serotonin 5-ht2a receptor can form complexes with the metabotropic glutamate mglur <dig> receptor  <cit>  and the dopamine d <dig> receptor  <cit> , which may play a major role in the action of antipsychotic drugs and hallucinogens. a heterocomplex is more than the sum of its individual receptors, since heteromerization can alter receptor mobility at the neuron surface, downstream signaling, and intracellular trafficking  <cit> .

understanding neurotransmitter receptor sets will require new analytical and theoretical approaches. functionally complete receptor sets have to be isolated and their dynamic properties investigated in specific brain regions and in individual cells  <cit> . while these studies pose technical challenges, they are likely to lead to major theoretical simplifications. some researchers have already used this approach with considerable success  <cit> . as a further step toward this goal, the present study used the allen human brain atlas  <cit>  to examine mrna expression associations among nearly all known g protein-coupled neurotransmitter receptors in the human brain.

RESULTS
the analysis used the mrna expression data of  <dig> g protein-coupled receptors  in  <dig> regions of six normal human brains presently available in the allen brain atlas database . the mrna amounts of many receptor pairs were very strongly correlated . the five strongest positive and negative correlations of each receptor are given in table  <dig>  the distribution of all  <dig> correlations had a nearly symmetric shape, with a single mode shifted toward the positive values . this distribution failed normality tests , but was well described by the beta distribution with the same range, mean and variance  . the distributions of several functionally meaningful subsets were not significantly different from the complete set : d =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ); : d =  <dig> , p = 1); : d =  <dig> , p =  <dig> ); : d =  <dig> , p = 1)).

the inter-subject correlations were obtained from  <dig> subjects .

the receptor numbers  are given in the left column and the correlations in the right column ). correlations with an absolute value of less than  <dig>  are not significant after the bonferroni correction  and should be interpreted with caution. the actual correlations may be somewhat stronger due the imperfect reliability of the expression data .

for compactness, the following abbreviations were used: gaba1 = gababr <dig>  gaba2 = gababr <dig> 

all statistically significant correlations among the receptors were plotted as a graph . the nociceptin receptor  had the highest vertex degree , due to its significant correlations with  <dig> receptors . the largest clique consisted of  <dig> completely interconnected vertices: the glutamate receptors mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  the adrenergic receptors α1b, α1d, β <dig>  the serotonin receptors 5-ht1a, 5-ht1f, 5-ht2a, the cholinergic receptors m <dig>  m <dig>  the histamine receptors h <dig>  h <dig>  the melanin-concentrating hormone mch <dig>  the neuropeptide y receptors y <dig>  y <dig>  the nociceptin receptor , and the somatostatin receptor sst <dig>  the distribution of the vertex degrees  appeared to be bimodal and did not follow the power law that is often observed in natural networks with high functional connectivity . however, a recent study has shown that a bimodal degree distribution can emerge in robust networks  <cit> .

next, the obtained correlation information was used to examine whether some receptors groups are more tightly interlinked than other receptors or, more presicely, whether the graph  can be broken down into distinct receptor communities. two community detection methods were used: the modularity algorithm and the clique percolation algorithm  <cit> . the modularity method revealed two major receptor communities . as recommended by palla et al.  <cit> , the clique percolation method was optimized using several correlation thresholds  and k-cliques of several sizes. the best separation was achieved with t =  <dig>  and k =  <dig>  which again revealed two distinct receptor communities . with the exception of one receptor , the separation among the receptors was identical to the one obtained with the modularity method. since the clique percolation method used more stringent criteria, it excluded some more weakly correlated receptors . these analyses suggest that the human brain has two functional receptor communities, within each of which the mrna levels are strongly correlated and can potentially affect each other. the first community contains the glutamate receptor mglur <dig>  the dopamine receptor d <dig>  the adrenergic receptor β <dig>  the serotonin receptors 5-ht1b, 5-ht2c, 5-ht <dig>  the cholinergic receptors m <dig> and m <dig>  the bradykinin receptors b <dig> and b <dig>  the cholecystokinin receptor cck <dig>  the crh receptor crf <dig>  the galanin receptor gal <dig>  the npy receptor y <dig>  the neurotensin receptor nt <dig>  the oxytocin receptor, the somatostatin receptors sst <dig> and sst <dig>  the tachykinin receptor nk <dig>  the vip receptor vpac <dig>  the purine receptor p2y <dig>  and the cannabinoid receptor cb <dig>  the second community contains the glutamate receptors mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  mglur <dig>  the dopamine receptor d <dig>  the adrenergic receptors α1b, α1d, β <dig>  the serotonin receptors 5-ht1a, 5-ht1f, 5-ht2a, 5-ht <dig>  the cholinergic receptors m <dig> and m <dig>  the histamine receptors h <dig> and h <dig>  the mch receptors mch <dig> and mch <dig>  the npy receptors y <dig> and y <dig>  the nociceptin receptor , the somatostatin receptor sst <dig>  and the vip receptor vpac <dig> 

discussion
the allen human brain atlas is a relatively new database  <cit>  that continues to be updated and refined. in the absence of generally accepted standards for how gene expression data should be normalized and presented, the published expression values should be treated with caution. the expression of many receptors is highly consistent across individuals, but some receptors show a high degree of variability . among them is the dopamine receptor  <dig> , which has been extensively studied because of a functionally important polymorphism in its exon  <dig>  <cit> . the origin of its inconsistent distribution across individuals is not clear and may be due to either unreliable detection or true expression differences in the population. notably, no relationship has been established between the drd <dig> alleles and their mrna levels  <cit> .

caution should also be exercised in the interpretation of mrna levels that show a consistent pattern across the subjects. for many receptors, the relationship between the mrna and protein quantities is often poorly understood, and a change in one of these measures may not indicate a change in the other. a recent large-scale study has shown that, on average, mrna levels explain around 40% of the variability in protein levels, and that the abundance of a protein is predominantly controlled by translation  <cit> . in addition, many neurotransmitter receptors operate in two different signaling modes: at the membrane surface through g-proteins and, when internalized, in an arrestin-dependent fashion  <cit> . neurotransmitter receptor genes can produce several mrna splice variants, some of which may be constitutively active   <cit> , or have different internalization properties  <cit> . also, protein molecules can be phosphorylated, glycosylated, and undergo other modifications  <cit> . these post-translational processes place severe limitations on functional inferences from mrna data. on the other hand, mrna quantification allows a high degree of specificity, which remains difficult to achieve in protein analyses. post-translational modifications of protein molecules and the absence of specific antibodies for a number of neurotransmitter receptors  currently do not allow large scale quantifications of proteins in the entire brain. even though the protein data remain limited, table  <dig> provides information about the possible inter-individual variability of the mrna levels of nearly all neurotransmitter receptors and will facilitate the interpretation of completed and future studies.

the analyzed mrna levels in brain structures reflect the cumulative gene expression in several types of neuronal and glial cells, with a possible contribution from endothelial and ependymal cells. this lack of spatial precision makes the obtained results too “coarse” for the modeling of local neural circuits. however, an association between the abundance of two receptors over many brain regions is functionally meaningful, just as biologically meaningful information can be obtained from the correlation between the population numbers of two species across geographic areas . hypofunction or hyperfunction of a receptor in a class of cells is likely to affect the activity of their local neuroecosystems, which may induce changes in the expression of receptors in other cells  <cit> . therefore, estimates of the most likely associations among receptors are important for the interpretation of receptor knockout models, as well as for the prediction of changes in other receptors associated with pharmacological targeting of a specific neurotransmitter receptor  <cit> . at present, no comprehensive quantitative analysis exists to facilitate these theoretical considerations, and published data are likely to be biased by hypothesis-driven approaches, funding agency priorities, and attracting nodes in researcher networks. while the current analysis is a step forward, major theoretical breakthroughs can be expected when technical capabilities become sufficiently advanced to dynamically monitor entire receptor sets in single neurons and glial cells  <cit> .

currently little information is available about the correlation between the mrna levels of receptors that form heteromeric complexes. among them, the complex between the metabotropic glutamate receptor mglur <dig> and the serotonin receptor 5-ht2a has been particularly well studied, partly because of its potential importance in schizophrenia and other related brain disorders  <cit> . it has been recently reported that the disruption of 5-ht2a receptor-dependent signaling can suppress mglur <dig> transcription through epigenetic modifications in the mglur <dig> gene promoter  <cit> . the present analysis found a highly significant positive correlation between the mrna levels of these two receptors . however, mglur <dig> had the highest positive correlations with the nociceptin receptor , the adrenergic α1d and β <dig> receptors, the histamine h <dig> receptor, and the purine p2y <dig> receptor; and the 5-ht2a receptor had the highest positive correlations with the histamine h <dig> receptor , the serotonin 5-ht1f receptor, the muscarinic cholinergic m <dig> receptor, and the melanin-concentrating hormone receptors mch <dig> and mch <dig> .

two receptor communities were extracted from the data . there are many neural circuits where these receptors interact, but it remains unclear whether the entire communities can be assigned a biologically meaningful role. it should be noted that many of the receptors in the two “minimal” communities  control global brain functions, such as wakefulness and sleep  <cit> . the two communities can be differentially affected in some brain disorders. for example, the 5-ht1a, 5-ht2a and 5-ht <dig> receptors belong to the same community  and are expressed by neurons in the medial prefrontal cortex  that project to the dorsal raphe nucleus and control serotonin release  <cit> . altered activity of these neurons has been implicated in mood disorders  <cit> . the exact structure of the communities is likely to become more refined as more data become available in the allen brain atlas. in general, receptor network analyses hold great promise for understanding the brain in health and disease, as has been demonstrated by recent research  <cit> .

the relatively simple distribution of correlations  raises interesting questions. theoretically, such a distribution can be obtained from a single dynamical interaction. depending on the numerical values of its coefficients, the same process can produce uncorrelated or highly correlated equilibrium values, even if the two receptors are strongly dynamically coupled  <cit> . since theoretically all receptors can be expressed by all brain cells and they can only differ in their equilibrium levels , such qualitative uniformity remains an intriguing possibility.

CONCLUSIONS
progress in neuroscience requires both accurate factual observations and complexity reduction. since information processing in the brain depends on thousands of unique neurotransmitter-receptor interactions, understanding how these neurotransmitter-receptor pairs operate in functional groups is not only a theoretical imperative, but also a practical necessity. the obtained results suggest that the apparent complexity of neurotransmitter signaling has an underlying global structure, which is not readily detectable if receptor interactions are studied in isolation.
