BACKGROUND
in drosophila the single stat , in conjunction with one cytokine , controls an array of developmental processes ranging from immune responses and heart development to the specification of border cells in the ovary and primordial germ cell formation in the gonads  <cit> . in contrast, mammals have seven stats   <cit> . although these stats recognize similar, if not identical, dna sequence motifs in vitro they execute cell- and context-specific functions in addition to overlapping and redundant functions. yet, cell-specific gene expression patterns are obtained despite different cells being exposed in vivo to similar, and in some cases identical, cytokines. the appropriate execution of these programs is determined by several regulatory layers  <cit> . these include a large number of membrane receptors that have the ability to differentially activate individual stats, cellular stat levels, the affinity of stats to receptors and their cognate jaks and possibly the ability of stats to recognize regulatory sequences only in certain contexts, such as composite promoter elements or chromatin configuration. in fact, evidence is emerging that specific chromatin remodeling is required for stat binding to a subset of loci  <cit> .

direct stat binding to cognate genomic targets will, at least in part, execute cytokine stimuli. with this in mind, new and critical insight into common and cell-specific functions of stats could come from genome-wide stat occupancy data sets. however, it is not clear to what extent different members of the stat family share genetic targets. in particular stat binding to the canonical gas  motif , the extent of cell specificity and the influence of stat concentration on their ability to occupy genomic sites are poorly understood. large-scale chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing  studies have explored in vivo binding of five different stats in a number of different cell types exposed to several cytokines. we have now comparatively reanalyzed this resource of  <dig> data sets and provide insight into the complexity of common and selective stat binding patterns that are unique to, as well as shared between, different cell lineages.

RESULTS
meta-analysis of chip-seq data sets reveals cell context as the major defining factor controlling stat binding to specific gas sites
the signal transducer and activator of transcription  family consist of seven transcription factors  called stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat <dig>  stat5a, stat5b and stat <dig>  which upon activation by cytokines bind to specific sequences called gas motifs   <cit> . to determine the extent of genomic binding of each stat member in various cell contexts, we collected available stat  chip-seq and control data sets from  <dig> independent studies   <cit>  and re-analyzed them using the same analysis pipeline . since the number of significant peaks is sensitive to algorithms  <cit> , we used three different peak-calling programs, macs , homer  and qeseq  as chen et al. suggested  <cit> . the combined peaks were categorized into three classes  according to the number of algorithms that detected the peaks . in this regard, the high- and intermediate-confidence peaks should be more reliable than low-confidence peaks due to the fact that any two different algorithms identified them as significant peaks .

comparative analysis of genome-wide stat binding data sets validated the cytokine-dependent nature of stat binding to dna. stat activation by cytokines induced a large number of genomic binding sites compared with corresponding unstimulated controls in all cases, regardless of the cell type and cytokine with the exception of stat5a-null cells . the treatment of stat5-null cells with growth hormone yielded no evident changes in the number of stat <dig> binding sites. even for the same stat, the number of binding sites greatly varied between different cell contexts. the total number of stat enriched binding sites ranged from several hundred to one hundred thousand depending on the cell type . as expected, low-confidence peaks  seem to be unreliable in some data sets . therefore, we only used high- and intermediate-peaks for the rest of the analyses. in addition to the quantitative aspect of genome-wide stat binding, we determined that cell context was the foremost defining factor in the establishment of genome-wide binding positions of stats. to estimate overall similarity of global stat binding sites, we performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering of  <dig> cell contexts based only on their genome-wide binding sites . these two-way comparisons elucidated the extent of distinct and overlapping stat occupancy between different cell types and individual stats. for instance, up to  <dig> samples obtained from t cell lineages with different stat members  and/or cytokine treatments  constituted the largest cluster on the heat map, whereas other cell contexts including mefs  and es  cells were distinct from this t cell group. this result demonstrates that the genomic binding capacity of stats is primarily defined by the cell type and less so by the individual stat protein. for example, the overlap of common binding sites between stats  <dig> and  <dig> in t cells  is greater that between stat <dig> in t cells and non-t cells .

stats regulate gene expression by cell-specific binding to distinct sets of gas motifs
the extent to which different members of transcription factor families bind to and occupy identical sites within the genome is a central issue, as different members of a given family activate distinct and cell-specific genetic programs  <cit> . in order to assess the extent of cell-type specific occupation of gas sites and infer their roles in gene regulation, we first identified all gas motifs around the peak center of stat binding sites  using the moods algorithm  <cit>  with the known stat position frequency matrix   <cit> . then, we measured chiped-tag density of all  <dig> chip-seqs around the center of the top  <dig>  highest peaks  in six representatives of the different cell types. this analysis demonstrated the existence of shared and cell-type specific stat binding sites with gas motifs . for each cell type approximately 50-85% of the stat binding sites were unique, even though most  of the sites contained gas motifs within a  <dig> bp perimeter from the center . for instance, 65% of stat <dig> binding sites in es cells did not coincide with the binding of any of the other stats in  <dig> different contexts , while stat binding sites in t cells largely overlapped . in female liver, less than 15% of stat <dig> binding sites were shared with any other stats in different cell types . this cell-type specificity of stat binding may contribute to the regulation of cell-type specific genes, which are involved in differentiation or developmental processes. to address this question, we assessed statistically significant functions of genes within flanking regions of stat binding sites in six different cell types using the great program  <cit> . each set of stat binding sites was indeed located near the genes that are particularly important for the respective cell types . in es cells stat <dig> bound to gas sites near genes involved in differentiation, maintenance and development of stem cells  and genes that are expressed in very early embryonic stages . in female liver, stat <dig> binding sites coincided with gas motifs located near genes contributing to metabolic processes, such as organic acids, carboxylic acids and lipid metabolic pathways . notably, the majority of these genes were specifically expressed in liver . overall, cell-type specific recognition of gas sites appears to be essential for maintaining cell identity as well as promoting proliferation and differentiation in response to cytokine signals.

gene sets targeted by all stat members independent of cell type and cytokine stimulus generate a jak-stat signature
the high degree of coinciding genomic occupancy by several, if not all, stat members in different t cell populations suggests that distinct cytokines are likely to control similar and overlapping gene sets. to characterize these gene sets, all stat binding sites from the  <dig> chip-seq data sets were integrated to define genome-wide cis-regulatory modules  associated with stat members. in general, crms are dna fragments that are recognized by more than one transcription factor  <cit> . therefore, we also asked whether additional transcription factors co-occupy these crms . the degree of evolutionary conservation of these crms between species measured by phastcons score  <cit>  was positively correlated with the number of overlaps . in general, high-confidence crms  were more conserved than intermediate-confidence sites . given the extent to which different stat members bound to identical genomic sites, the most conserved of these crms were of particular interest since they might constitute key cis-regulatory modules targeted primarily by any of the stats. to elucidate these crms called common stat-controlled crms , we identified genomic regions recognized by stats from at least  <dig> different chip-seq data sets. a total of  <dig> csccs were identified and  <dig> genes are located around the csccs .  <dig> out of  <dig> genes were located near the csccs which were simultaneously shared by stats across six representative cell types as shown in figure  <dig>  the majority of  <dig> csccs were located in promoter , intergenic and intronic sequences . the csccs tend to be located within promoter regions as compared with the distribution of all stat binding sites. functional clustering of nearby genes illustrated that these csccs were significantly associated with jak-stat signaling and interferon-gamma signaling pathways  . specifically, the stat <dig>  socs <dig>  socs <dig>  cish and irf <dig> genes, which are bona fide components of the jak-stat signaling pathway  <cit> , harbored these csccs in promoter proximal regions . all csccs were part of highly conserved sequences in vertebrates, and the peak centers of stat binding and gas sites coincided. although these csccs were recognized by the majority of stats in different cell contexts, we also detected cell-type specific crms which seem to be recognized by stats in only a few cell types. for example, two highly conserved crms in the socs <dig> upstream region were recognized only by stat <dig> in mefs and 3t3-l <dig> cells, by stat <dig> in macrophages and by stat <dig> in es cells. on the other hand, stat4/5/ <dig> in t cells and stat <dig> in liver tissues specifically bound to sites in the cish downstream region . these common and cell-specific bindings of stats to gas sites in crms likely reflect context-dependent gene regulations in different cell types via stats.

distinct transcription factors work in concert with stats
recent studies have revealed that several transcription factors  bind to the same cis-regulatory modules, thereby regulating nearby genes  <cit> . although the seven stat members recognize the same nucleotide consensus motif of ttcnnngaa, except for stat <dig>   <cit> , distinct sets of tfs might co-localize with stats and contribute to the diversity of stat binding sites depending on cell context. to address this question, we first identified the top three significantly over-represented motifs within +/−  <dig> bp flanking regions of the center of the top  <dig> stat binding sites  in six representative cell-types  using the meme-chip program   <cit> . this de novo motif identification analysis successfully identified the gas motif in all cell contexts as significant . in addition, unique sets of known tfs verified by the tomtom algorithm  <cit>  were detected along with gas motifs . the same analysis with stat <dig> and stat <dig> chip-seq sets also identified gas motifs as the most over-represented motifs validating our motif analysis scheme . upon ifnγ induction, the irf1/ <dig>  binding motif was the most significant motif associated with stat binding sites in macrophages but not in other cell types, while the esrrb  binding motif was only seen in es cells upon lif  treatment. binding motifs for runx <dig> , which is expressed in t cell lineages  <cit> , were identified in t cells upon il- <dig> induction. many stat5-bound sequences  in growth hormone stimulated liver contained hnf4a  binding motifs that were frequently found near liver specific genes  <cit> . these results are consistent with previous reports  <cit> . additionally, investigation of all the stat binding sites in different cell types demonstrated that these particular combinations of tfs were not only limited to subsets of the sequences where a given stat was highly enriched  but also could be found in the majority of stat <dig> binding sites in specific cell types .

in order to establish whether these crms are recognized by tfs in vivo, we integrated nine tf chip-seq experiments from mouse liver and 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit>  and drew peak density graphs over the stat binding sites of six representative cell types . as predicted by our analysis, cebp  a and hnf4a highly occupied stat <dig> binding sites in 3t3-l <dig> cells and liver, respectively. additionally, binding of cebpb, cebpd and gr , which are key tfs during early adipogenesis  <cit> , co-localized with stat <dig> in 3t3-l <dig> cells. also, binding of cebpa, foxa <dig>  and foxa <dig>  key regulators in initiating liver specification  <cit> , coincided with stat <dig>  however, e2f <dig> and p <dig>  were not related to stat <dig> binding in any cell type.

to validate whether these crms are correlated with expression of cell-specific genes, we incorporated nine rna-seq data sets derived from various tissues  <cit> . the significance of an association between the crms and gene expression was assessed by calculating empirical p-values from monte carlo procedures with  <dig> iterations for each tissue as described previously   <cit> . we found that these crms were significantly enriched near genes with higher expression levels in the respective cell type. for instance,  <dig> genes near stat3-associated crms in es cells were highly expressed in the es cells  but not in the other cell types, whereas expression of  <dig> genes near stat5-associated crms in liver was significantly elevated in liver . these results highlight that defined sets of cell-type specific transcription factors and stats cooperate via cell-type specific cis-regulatory modules to generate cell specific gene expression pattern, whereas stats control the jak-stat signaling related genes via the csccs .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we explored the extent to which gas motifs throughout the mammalian genome are occupied by any given stat in various cell types subjected to different cytokine stimuli. due to a paucity of available stat <dig>  stat <dig> and stat <dig> chip-seq data, results were mainly derived from stat <dig> chip-seq data sets. our meta-analysis confirmed the increment of stat binding on gas sites upon cytokine induction . most of the up to  <dig>  sequences occupied by stats  contained a gas motif . since the mouse genome harbors more than one million gas sites , up to 10% of these are occupied by stats at any given moment. however, the probability of being bound by a stat protein is not equal for all gas sites. john et al. demonstrated that up to 95% of de novo glucocorticoid receptor binding sites are pre-determined by chromatin accessibility  <cit> . in accordance with this, our meta-analysis of genome-wide stat binding sites in  <dig> different cell contexts showed that the binding of stats to gas sites was mostly defined by the cell type compared to other features such as the type of stats and the cytokine . therefore, the capacity of stats to access specific gas sites seems to be pre-determined by the cell type via open chromatin and this notion was validated by previous studies using dnase-seq and stat <dig> chip-seq in mouse liver  <cit> . in support of this, each cell type displayed a unique stat binding pattern. the majority of the stat-bound gas sites were located near genes with cell-specific expression patterns. this result can explain the cell-specific aspect of stats that transmits signals for the growth-, survival- and differentiation-related genes corresponding to a given cell type. in contrast to cell-type restricted binding obtained for most sites, we detected  <dig> highly conserved gas sites whose recognition by stats transcended cell types. these crccs, which were targeted by any member of the stat family regardless of cell type and cytokine stimulus, included classical jak-stat signature genes, such as stat <dig>  socs <dig>  socs <dig>  cish, ifnar <dig> and irf <dig> genes. thus, our analysis strengthens previous knowledge that stats recognize gas motifs nearby target genes upon cytokine induction and further shows that stats target cell-type specific as well as common jak-stat signature genes.

a previous study using an aneuploid mouse strain carrying human chromosome  <dig> revealed that transcriptional outputs are determined primarily by genetic sequence besides epigenetic and cellular environment  <cit> . several studies demonstrated that nucleosome positions are also determined by nucleotide sequences and therefore, successfully predicted ~50% of in vivo nucleosome positions solely based on dna sequences  <cit> . these findings highlighted the importance of dna sequences involved in gene regulation. in this regard, binding motifs for distinct transcription factors were enriched around the center of stat binding sites in specific cell types, suggesting that cell-specific gene regulation of stats might be driven by cooperative activity of cell-type restricted or enriched tfs. for instance, stat <dig> is known to interact with runx <dig> physically in vitro which is corroborated by our finding in t cells  <cit> . the binding motif of hnf4a, which is a key tf in liver  <cit> , coincided significantly with stat <dig> binding sites in liver, while none of the other stats showed any significant association with hnf4a in the different cell types. cebpa, which is sufficient to promote differentiation of growth-arrested 3t3-l <dig> cells  <cit> , was significantly over-represented within flanking regions of stat <dig> in 3t3-l <dig> cells. indeed, the integration of nine tf chip-seq data sets from liver and 3t3-l <dig> cells revealed that stat <dig> coincided with cell-enriched tfs. cebpa, cebpb, cebpd and gr coincided with stat <dig> in the 3t3-l <dig> cells, while cebpa, foxa <dig>  foxa <dig> and hnf4a significantly associated with stat <dig> binding sites in female mouse liver. however, e2f <dig> and p <dig> were not significantly associated with the stat <dig> binding sites in both cell types suggesting that only defined cell-specific co-tfs are related with stats. moreover, this finding is supported by a recent study demonstrating that smad <dig>  a master transcription factor generating cell-type specific effects of tgfβ signaling, coincided with oct <dig> in es cells, myod <dig> in myotubes and pu. <dig> in pro-b cells  <cit> . collectively, the cooperative activity of stats with associated tfs appeared to control cell-type specific genes in concordance with previous studies  <cit> , while the accessibility of their target gas sites seems to be pre-determined by epigenetic features including chromatin configurations  <cit> . future studies will be required to elucidate which tfs are pioneer factors that recruit co-tfs and/or influence chromatin modifications or bystanders.
