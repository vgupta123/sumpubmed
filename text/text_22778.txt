BACKGROUND
the white rot fungus rigidoporus microporus  syn. rigidoporus lignosus is the most destructive root pathogen of the tropical rubber tree, hevea brasiliensis muell. arg, which is the major source of natural rubber  <cit> . it is an economically important pathogen of h. brasiliensis with yearly economic losses of millions of dollars in the tropics. the control and management of the white rot disease of rubber in most tropical countries have been hampered due to limited knowledge of the population genetics of the different isolates  <cit> , as well as molecular basis of virulence mechanisms. additionally, members of the white rot basidiomycota fungi are known to play major roles in nutrient and carbon cycling in temperate and tropical forests  <cit> . it is therefore expected that the rigidoporus group will harbor a repertoire of a wide range of useful enzymes important for lignocellulose degradation with potential applications in bioenergy processing and utilization. however, there is presently no genomic or transcriptome resources available for any species within the genus, rigidoporus.

in nature, the fungus infects over forty other tropical tree species including tectonia grandis, artocarpus nobilis, theobroma cacao and cocos nucifera , but the pathogen is a problem mainly in rubber plantations in asia and africa. the pathogen was a major problem on 43 % of h. brasiliensis plantations in a survey conducted in malaysia in  <dig>  <cit> . in nigeria, r. microporus is responsible for 96 % of incidences of root diseases in rubber plantations  <cit> .

the fungus produces rhizomorphs which can grow several meters in the soil and attach to wood debris. above ground symptoms are only visible once the roots are completely damaged. the rhizomorphs remain in the soil after the death of trees and may serve as source of inoculum for infecting other trees or continue its survival by obtaining nutrients from dead wood  <cit> .

there is a high density of rhizomorphs and mycelia of the fungus in the soil of h. brasiliensis infected natural forests and plantations  <cit>  indicating its capacity for a saprotrophic lifestyle. besides being a serious pathogen, r. microporus is a typical white rot basidiomycete with the potential to degrade lignin and cellulose components of wood.

to obtain an overall view of all the processes that occur during fungal growth as well as during wood degradation, it is necessary to identify as many as possible genes that are expressed during the saprotrophic colonization. the use of high-throughput dna sequencing has facilitated the characterization and identification of phytopathogenic fungi genes expressed during developmental stages or fungal pathogenicity  <cit> . rna-seq technology applied in this study detects novel genes as well as provides information about previously uncharacterized genes. next-generation sequencing technologies have led to the generation of huge genomic and transcriptomic data that have improved our understanding of wood decay by white rot basidiomycetes. this revolution has evolved from single genome sequencing to large scale basidiomycete dual  and multiple  genome and transcriptome comparative analysis. the model white rot fungus, phanerochaete chrysosporium genome and transcriptome has been studied in detail, revealing a rich repertoire of lignocellulose degrading genes  <cit> . other white rot species with transcriptomic profile information on growth on various carbohydrate sources include fomitiporia mediterranea  <cit>  and pycnoporus cinnabarinus  <cit> . genome and transcriptome of the white rot fungi, phlebiopsis gigantea with resin and fatty acid degradation potential has also been studied  <cit> . on the other hand, there are very few studies on transcriptomic information regarding wood-decay basidiomycota with established parasitic and saprotrophic lifestyles. genome and microarray transcriptome studies of the conifer root and butt pathogen, heterobasidion annosum sensu lato  on pine wood revealed a plethora of glycoside hydrolases, multi copper oxidases and manganese peroxidase enzymes implicated in lignocellulose degradation  <cit> .

a search for r. microporus in the national center for biotechnology information  resource revealed no information relative to est , unigene and gene, while there are only  <dig> protein sequences deposited . genomic information related to the major pathogen host, h. brasiliensis has recently received more attention with the release of the draft genome sequence of the tree  <cit> . however, there is almost no information on the role of r. microporus during its saprotrophic lifestyle at the genomic and transcriptomic level. additionally, most rigidoporus species belong to the meripilus clade of the polyporales, one of the orders of agaricomycetes. the transcriptome sequence would also contribute to further enrich the power of comparative genomics information in this basidiomycete group. furthermore, the primary importance of the rigidoporus transcriptome resource is partly due to the negative impact of this pathogen to productivity of tropical rubber tree in several parts of the world. the economic loss is enormous not only in terms of wood production but also on indirect impacts on global latex production on an important raw material for automobile and airplane tyre production.

the objectives of this study were;  to study the transcript profiles of genes expressed during saprotrophic growth of r. microporus on h. brasiliensis  to get an insight on the potential ability of the fungus to degrade natural rubber latex produced by the host and  to provide genetic resources that would facilitate further research at the molecular and genetic levels of the lifestyle of this fungus. as there is presently no genomic data available for this fungus, we performed rna-seq de novo assembly and compared the transcriptomes of the fungus grown on nutrient media with and without rubber wood. the results generated in this study would provide insights on the genes utilized by this fungus for lignocellulose degradation of rubber wood and also serve as an important resource for future studies on this economically important pathogen.

RESULTS

discussion
lignocellulose, the most abundant source of terrestrial carbon and consisting of cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin and lignin is degraded basically by wood and litter decomposing fungi  <cit> . members of the white rot fungi belonging to the polyporales are active wood lignocellulose degraders  <cit> . rigidoporus microporus is a serious pathogen for rubber plantations in asia and africa. the pathogen spreads through root contact and continues to decay wood long after the tree has fallen  <cit> . it was shown in an earlier study that the isolate used for this transcriptome study caused a dry mass loss of 21 % of h. brasiliensis wood blocks after 6 months  <cit> . some studies have also shown the ability of the fungus to secret peroxidases and laccases. previous studies  <cit>  showed that lignin degradation by r. microporus involves the synergistic action of manganese peroxidase and laccase, and was enhanced by glucose oxidase. comparisons of laccase activity from the fungus and other white rot fungi have also been reported  <cit> .

in this study, we performed rna-seq de novo assembly of r. microporus during saprotrophic growth on rubber  with emphasis on lignocellulose degrading genes employed by the white rot fungus. we also identified potential genes which r. microporus could utilize to degrade natural rubber  produced by h. brasiliensis, since the fungus is able to survive in the living tree.

in order to generate a high percentage of annotation for the assembled unigenes, five different databases  were used in the annotation. analysis of the de novo assembly of the transcriptome of r. microporus on rubber wood produced  <dig>  annotated unigene coding transcripts. in this study, the transcriptome analysis was based on the differentially expressed transcripts between the two conditions, control and saprotrophic growth on rubber wood. the results showed that there was clearly, increased gene expression differences for the transcriptome in rubber wood compared to the control;  <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in rubber wood and  <dig> transcripts up-regulated in the control. there were over  <dig> lignocellulose associated transcripts differentially expressed in the transcriptome and the names of the enzymes were confirmed by comparing to the carbohydrate-active enzymes  database .

glycoside hydrolase family genes encoding for enzymes reported to be involved in cellulose hydrolysis and breakdown were detected in the r. microporus transcriptome. gh family genes; gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> were highly expressed in rubber wood. gh <dig> and gh <dig> family genes containing bond cleaving endoglucanases are known to attack β- <dig>  4-glycosidic bonds in non- crystalline cellulose, while gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> families act at the ends of cellulose chains  <cit> . interestingly, all gh <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in rubber wood. crystalline cellulose is degraded mainly by auxiliary activity family  lytic polysaccharide monooxygenase –lpmo, former gh <dig> family which is highly induced in our study  <cit> . transcriptomic studies also showed up-regulation of gh <dig> transcripts in wood for phanerochaete chrysosporium, p. carnosa and heterobasidion annosum  <cit> . relative high transcript levels of genes known to be involved in both crystalline and non-crystalline cellulose were present in the transcriptome. hemi-cellulose breakdown is more complex because of the presence of acetyl groups and covalent cross-linkages, thus degradation requires several backbone cleaving and de-branching enzymes  <cit> . gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  gh <dig>  ce <dig> and ce <dig> genes were strongly up-regulated in rubber wood and have been implicated in hemicellulose degradation. gh <dig> and gh <dig> family genes comprising xylanases are needed for xylan breakdown  <cit> . xylosidases from gh <dig> and gh <dig> families are involved in degradation of xylooligosaccharides to monosaccharides  <cit> . gh <dig> family comprises a variety of enzymes which cleave glycosidic linkages of hemicellulose  <cit> . interestingly, all gh <dig> and gh <dig> genes in the r. microporus transcriptome were up-regulated in rubber wood. hemicellulose breakdown also involves the actions of gh <dig> and gh <dig> , ce <dig>  and ce <dig>  which collectively complete the degradation process by cleaving backbone chains and side groups  <cit> . pectin breakdown is carried out by gh <dig> , gh <dig>  and gh <dig>  by cleaving of complex branching  <cit> . all gh <dig>  gh <dig> and gh <dig> transcripts were up-regulated in rubber wood indicating a potential implication in pectin degradation during saprotrophic growth. moreover, these genes might also be relevant for the pathogenic ability of this fungus, as gh <dig> family play an important role in pectin degradation in fungal pathogens  <cit> . ce family genes; chitin deacetylase  and pectine esterases  previously identified in genomes of some white rot polypores  <cit>  were found to be highly expressed in the transcriptome. several putative cephalosporin esterase  family genes not previously characterized in basidiomycetes were highly expressed in rubber wood. the enzyme cephalosporin esterase can deacetylate various cephalosporins. cephalosporin belongs to the group of β-lactam antibiotics produced by some fungi and horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to fungi has been proposed as part of its evolutionary origin  <cit> . the ce <dig> gene highly expressed in rubber wood share closest similarity  with the predicted cephalosporin esterase of the white rot fungus, fomitiporia mediterranea . further study and characterization of this gene could shed more light on its function in basidiomycetes.

a number of laccases and a large number of manganese peroxidases were highly induced in rubber wood. laccases together with the class ii heme-containing peroxidases  are the major enzyme machinery used by white rot basidiomycetes in lignin deconstruction  <cit> . manganese peroxidase  and lignin peroxidase  are the most effective lignin degrading enzymes with mnps more widely distributed in basidiomycetes and are currently receiving more attention as potential sources of ligninolytic enzymes  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> laccases and  <dig> mnps transcripts were significantly up-regulated in rubber wood, which might suggest potential relevance of these enzymes for lignin degradation. the mnp <dig> gene highly expressed in rubber wood share closest similarity  with the mnp <dig> of the white rot fungus, f. mediterranea . the number of significantly expressed mnps is high when compared to the number expressed in other white rot transcriptomic studies on wood degradation. microarray transcriptomic studies of h. annosum growing on a gradient of bark, heartwood and sapwood showed that a total of  <dig> mnps and  <dig> multicopper oxidases were significantly up-regulated  <cit> . rna-seq transcriptomic studies by using the model pycnoporus cinnabarinus white rot basidiomycete expressed  <dig> laccases and  <dig> mnp in birch wood  <cit> . these differences could be due to certain technical advantages of deep sequencing rna-seq technology  compared to microarray  <cit> . other probable reasons could be due to the fact that, the number and variety of enzymes employed in lignocellulose degradation is quite diverse and depends on substrate, lifestyle and fungal species  <cit> .

r. microporus produces extensive rhizomorphs in the soil surrounding rubber trees and its characteristic reddish brown basidiocarps are often on the roots and stems of a decaying tree. natural rubber latex  which flows from the laticifer tubes of the phloem in h. brasiliensis is a defence response to stem wounding. this process is exploited for tapping and collection of rubber latex when a cut is made on the bark of the tree. survival of the pathogen might require the ability to degrade or survive in latex rich environment of the rubber tree. a degradation pathway for the rubber tree latex has been proposed based on studies on the rubber latex degrading bacteria gordonia polyisoprenivorans  <cit> . a large number of unigenes that are directly implicated in rubber latex degradation pathway were expressed in the r. microporus transcriptome. in particular, multiple transcripts coding for the enzymes; acyl-coa synthetase, enoyl-coa hydratase and acyl-coa acetyltransferase were induced in both growth conditions  used in this study suggesting constitutive expression of some of the genes. the pathway shows that acyl-coa synthetase converts the organic acids derived from β-oxidation of the rubber latex into acyl-coa thioester. enoyl-coa hydratase is involved in isomerization while acyl-coa acetyltransferase releases acetyl-coa into the citric acid cycle  <cit> . the potential ability for rubber latex degradation by r. microporus is further underscored by the induction of several genes in the transcriptome that are involved in fatty acid degradation. this ability might be crucial for the survival of the pathogen on the living h. brasiliensis tree during necrotrophic growth. given the molecular evidence for a possible host jump from other trees to h. brasiliensis and the evolution of the pathogen in absence of h. brasiliensis  <cit> , r. microporus might have acquired genes that can effectively metabolize fatty acid secondary metabolites produced by the tree. the ability to metabolize and degrade fatty acid related secondary metabolites might be responsible for its ability to survive in the tree in the presence of latex.

our transcriptome analysis also included genes encoding important fungal proteins like abc transporters and hydrophobins. atp binding cassette  transporters have received much research attention in recent years because of their various predicted functions which includes transport of materials across biological membranes  <cit> . two abc transporter sub-families  which are present in genomes of other white rot polypores were induced in rubber wood, although the precise biological functions for most of the abc transporters still remain unknown. however, there are evidences for potential involvement of fungal abc transporters in tolerance and resistance to the chemical defense components of conifer trees. a role for a specific abc-g transporter in the monoterpene resistance has been demonstrated in the pine pathogen grosmannia clavigera  <cit>  and a similar role has been suggested for an abc-g transporter in the wood-decay fungus phlebiopsis gigantea  <cit> . several hydrophobin genes were differentially expressed in the r. microporus transcriptome on wood and non-wood media. hydrophobins are surface active proteins that have been reported to be implicated in different stages of the fungal lifestyles like fruiting body formation, hyphae growth and emergence, pathogenicity factors and biological control mechanism  <cit> . the number of expressed hydrophobin transcripts  is comparable to  <dig> transcripts expressed in microarray studies of heterobasidion sp. on pine wood  <cit> .

in order to further elucidate the mechanisms involved in wood degradation and utilization of the degradation products by r. microporus, we analyzed genes largely affected during carbohydrate metabolism. phosphoglucomutases and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, both involved in the final stages of glucose metabolism were down-regulated in rubber wood. the higher induction of these genes in the control might be due to more resource allocation due to the absence of lignocellulosic substrates in the control. in contrast, fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase i involved in the interconversion of glucose phosphate to fructose phosphate, isocitrate dehydrogenase  which converts isocitrate to 2-oxoglutarate and acetyl-coa synthetase which synthesizes acetyl-coa for the citric acid cycle were highly up-regulated in rubber wood. finally, genes which encode alcohol dehydrogenase was also documented. alcohol dehydrogenase facilitate the interconversion between alcohols and aldehydes or ketones with the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we present for the first time, the transcriptomic profile of genes expressed by the white rot fungus, r. microporus during saprotrophic growth on rubber  wood. the de novo rna-seq assembly and annotation revealed a very good coverage of the transcriptome. the assembled unigenes contained vast amount of genes encoding major lignocellulose degrading enzymes, especially manganese peroxidases. our results suggest that the fungus has the capacity to degrade both crystalline and non-crystalline cellulose, hemi-cellulose and pectin. transcriptome analysis also revealed a large number of peroxidases, laccases, aldo-keto reductases, alcohol oxidases, nadp oxidoreductases and copper radical oxidases utilized in lignin degradation of rubber wood. r. microporus also expressed numerous genes involved in fatty acid metabolism and breakdown; a feature supported by its ability to express genes involved in natural rubber latex degradation. pathway enrichment analysis also revealed some enzymes with potential application in biotechnology. high correlation between the differentially expressed gene assessed by qrt-pcr results and the rna-seq results also confirm the reliability of rna-seq technology. to conclude, the number of annotated unigenes  and expressed lignocellulose degrading transcripts  indicated that r. microporus is a necrotrophic/saprotrophic basidiomycete model with vast capacity to breakdown lignocelluloses.
