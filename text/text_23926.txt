BACKGROUND
the incidence of prostate cancer  is increasing worldwide though varies amongst different ethnic groups  <cit> . it is a common malignancy affecting global population of men and is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. the prevalence of this cancer is highest in the western countries and lowest in the asian countries  <cit> . despite its high prevalence, very little is known about the molecular mechanism of its tumorigenesis.

reports are there suggesting the involvement of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig>  x and the y encompassing several genetically susceptible loci  <cit>  though their precise roles still remain unclear. the advanced stage of pc shows complex chromosomal changes accumulated during the tumour progression  <cit> . loss of the y chromosome is a common chromosomal abnormality observed in the human pc  <cit>  and this occurs only in neoplastic, but not in stromal cells  <cit> . loss of genetic material may lead to the loss of putative tumour suppressor genes, which will ultimately lead to cancer. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that a normal human y chromosome transferred to a y chromosome lacking pc cell line pc <dig>  suppressed its tumorigenic property  <cit> . genetic predisposition of certain y chromosomal haplogroups towards pc strongly suggests a positive correlation  <cit> . however, study conducted on korean population showed lack of association between y chromosomal haplogroups and pc  <cit> . the involvement of several y linked genes and loci have been reported to be associated with the progression of pc  <cit> . the male sex determining gene sry is down regulated in pc and is a negative regulator of the androgen receptor  <cit> . sry does not express in any adult male tissue except the adult testis. however, sry is expressed in du <dig>  <cit> , androgen untreated lncap cells  <cit>  and prostate adenocarcinoma cell lines. thus, sry gene seems to play an important role for the development and progression of pc.

the human y chromosome is male specific, constitutively haploid, passed on from father to son and largely escapes meiotic recombination. approximately, 95%  of the human y chromosome represents non recombining region of y , also known as msy. similarly, 5%  of the y-chromosome is composed of pseudo-autosomal region  necessary for the pairing with the sex chromosomes. there are  <dig> msy specific sts markers encompassing the human y chromosome with an average spacing of  <dig> kb spanning over  <dig> loci  <cit> . deletion mapping based on the stss has advanced our understanding of the y chromosome structure and functions. previous studies were mostly conducted on three commercially available pc cell lines lncap, pc <dig> and du <dig> using chromosome banding techniques  <cit> , fluorescence in situ hybridization   <cit> , comparative genomic hybridization   <cit> , and spectral karyotyping   <cit> . however, none of these techniques provided evidence towards the involvement of y chromosome linked genes and loci. in the present study, we studied du <dig>  and lncap  cell lines using  <dig> stss specific to msy. du <dig> is hypotriploid having both  <dig> and  <dig> chromosomes with highest rate of occurrence and carries single y per cell. the y chromosome of du <dig> carries a translocated part of chromosome  <dig>  <cit> . lncap is hypotetraploid having  <dig> chromosomes occurring in 22% of the cells  <cit>  and carries  <dig> y chromosomes per cell  <cit> .

approximately, 20% of the human y chromosome harbours dyz <dig> satellite sequence  <cit> . dyz <dig> was identified as  <dig>  kb band generated on haeiii digestion of the human male genomic dna  <cit> . a normal human y chromosome contains approximately 4000– <dig> copies of the dyz <dig> arrays  <cit> . since dyz <dig> copies do not participate in recombination, it was deduced to have no functional or evolutionary advantage  <cit> . however, this is now reported to play a crucial role in chromatin folding and maintenance of the structural integrity of the y chromosome  <cit> .

with this background, we studied status of several y linked genes and loci and assessed copy number variation of dyz <dig> arrays using real time pcr in du <dig> and lncap cell lines. in addition, we sequenced the 3564 bp unit of dyz <dig> array and the coding region of sry gene from these cell lines.

RESULTS
status of the msy region in du145
the genomic dna from du <dig> and lncap was screened for the presence or absence of  <dig> stss specific to msy . these stss in both the cell lines were found to be intact.

multi-copy stss are indicated by star  and plus  sign denotes the presence of a particular sts.

herv <dig> provirus sequence recombination
human azfa region contains herv <dig> provirus a and b sequences and homologous recombination between these two regions accounts for most of the azfa deletions  <cit> . the azfa regions of du <dig> and lncap y chromosomes were found to remain intact showing the presence of usp9y and dby genes .

interstitial deletion mapping
there are known deletion patterns observed in different clinical conditions e.g. azfa, p5- proximal p <dig>  p5- distal p <dig>  azfc, gr/gr, b1/b <dig> and b2/b <dig> and tspy-tspy deletion  <cit> . we have screened stss encompassing these regions which were found to remain intact in du <dig> of lncap cells .

daz snv analysis
the normal y chromosome harbours four copies of daz gene  <cit> . the snv analysis of daz was conducted using appropriate enzymes  <cit>  to digest pcr products . the daz region in du <dig> and lncap showed presence of both alleles a and b for the snvs  screened. for daz-snv_vi and bpy <dig>  du <dig> showed both the alleles a and b while lncap had only allele a .

sry gene sequence
we amplified 824 bp fragment of the sry exon having 615 bp long coding fragment , cloned and sequenced. the sequences of the sry gene in both du <dig> and lncap were found to be intact .

status of the dyz <dig> array
for ascertaining structural status of the dyz <dig> array,  <dig> sets of primers were designed  to amplify  <dig> fragments  from a single  <dig>  kb array of dyz <dig> . the analysis of all the  <dig> combinations showed intact dyz <dig> arrays both in du <dig> and lncap.

copy number calculation of dyz <dig> using real time pcr
we calculated dyz <dig> copy number in du <dig> and lncap by real time pcr using sybr green chemistry employing absolute quantification method and a standard curve of cloned dyz <dig> plasmid using ten-fold dilutions starting with  <dig> crore  copies. the amplification plot, dissociation curve and standard curve are given in figure 5a, b, and c, respectively. figure 5d represents the number of dyz <dig> copies. du <dig> contains  <dig> copies, while lncap contains  <dig> copies per  <dig>  pg of genomic dna.

3564 bp array sequence of dyz1
four pcr amplified fragments  were cloned and sequenced. sequencing results showed insertion, deletion and several point mutations. compared to normal sequences of the dyz <dig>  the number of highly abundant “ttcca” repeats  <cit>  and its derivatives per 3564 bp  were found to be different amongst normal, du <dig> and lncap cells . the dyz <dig> sequences from both du <dig> and lncap cells were aligned with the reference sequence from ncbi database  using clustalw software . between du <dig> and the reference sequence;  <dig> point mutations, between du <dig> and lncap;  <dig> point mutations and between lncap and the reference sequence;  <dig> point mutations were detected. compared to the reference dyz <dig> sequence, du <dig> showed insertion of 16 bp in between the position of 1654- and 1655 bp, deletions of 1 bp at position 792 bp and 15 bp between 2606– <dig> position, respectively. lncap showed insertion of 15 bp between 1654- 1655 bp position and deletion of 114 bp between 2541–2657 bp. the regions showing major deletions are given in figure  <dig> . a comparison of lncap with du <dig> showed a net deletion of 99 bp in lncap. upon virtual restriction mapping of  <dig>  kb unit of dyz <dig> using restriction mapper version  <dig> software, loss and gain of several restriction sites were detected . compared to the reference sequence, a total of  <dig> restriction enzyme sites  were lost and eco57i site was gained in du <dig>  similarly, a total  <dig> restriction enzyme sites  were lost and eco57i site was gained in lncap. thus, one eco57i site was gained in both the cell lines. differences in the restriction site frequency were compared amongst du <dig>  lncap and the reference sequence . the result showed dyz <dig> arrays are uniquely affected in each category of cells.

the loss or gains of the restriction sites with respect to the reference sequence are highlighted in bold.

fish analysis
the prostate cells du <dig> might have encountered many changes including translocation of the part of 20th chromosome to the y chromosome. the du <dig> y chromosome was found to harbour only  <dig> copies of dyz <dig> which is far less than that in a normal y chromosome. the dyz <dig> constitutes approximately 20% of the normal human y chromosome needed for the maintenance of its structural and functional integrities. a decrease in the number of arrays seems to threaten the survival of y chromosome in du <dig> cell. to ascertain the presence or the absence of y chromosome in du <dig> cells, we conducted fish experiment using a labelled dyz <dig> probe. approximately,  <dig> nuclei and metaphases were screened. to rule out the possibility of experimental error, as a positive control, the metaphases from the normal human male were hybridized with dyz <dig> probe. several nuclei and metaphases in du <dig> were found to be devoid of dyz <dig> fluorescence signals. this way, approximately, 48% of du <dig> cells were found to have no y chromosome .

discussion
du <dig> and lncap cells originated from prostate tumours. despite involvement of several chromosomes in the etiology of pc, our focus remained on the y chromosome of the two cell lines to assess several y linked genes and dyz <dig> regions. sequences of the sry gene were found to be normal in both the cells. previous studies conducted on pc cell lines employed conventional g-banding, fish, cgh and sky approaches. however, these techniques owing to innate limitations, do not detect microdeletions. despite  <dig> stss encompassing azfa, azfb and azfc screened in this study, no microdeletions were detected suggesting that msy remained intact in both the cell lines.

in an earlier report, y chromosome was excluded from the cgh analysis because of the presence of a large heterochromatic region  <cit> . in this study, we particularly focused on the heterochromatic region dyz <dig> and assessed not only its copy number variation but also indels all along the length of the array. we detected  <dig> copies in du <dig> and that of  <dig> in lncap cells. significant difference in the copy number of dyz <dig> between du <dig> and lncap could be due to the unequal number of y chromosome per cell. it may be noted that du <dig> carries single y chromosome per cell coupled with a major translocation of part of 20th chromosome to the y chromosome, whereas lncap carries  <dig> y chromosomes per cell  <cit> . in an earlier study on the biopsied samples of pc, we detected  <dig> copies of the dyz <dig>  <cit>  which is in accordance with our present study.

though msy was intact in du <dig> and lncap cells but dyz <dig> was clearly affected showing insertion, deletion, frequent point mutations and copy number variations. these mutational events, not only shifts the frame of abundant “ttcca” repeats but also generate its derivatives leading to the shrinkage or expansion of the same. the insertion and deletion of 16 bp kept the frame unchanged and maintained the original length of array of 3564 bp in du <dig>  due to insertion of 15 bp and deletion of 114 bp, the lncap cells showed net loss of 99 bp in the array of 3564 bp . a normal array of 3564 bp harbours approximately  <dig> different restriction enzyme recognition sites  <cit> . we detected more loss of restriction sites in both the cell lines than that of their gains. startlingly, a single eco57i site was gained in both the cell types though its biological significance remained unclear. these results clearly suggest that dyz <dig> is indeed affected during the process of cells becoming cancerous. despite these changes, y chromosome survived in about 58% of du <dig> cells . most likely, such du <dig> cells have managed to retain the critical number of the dyz <dig> copies with near normal sequences needed for the sustenance of the y chromosome.

the african-american men have been found to show highest and japanese, the lowest incidences of pc in the world  <cit> . this suggests that males from different ethnicity and geographical regions may be different with respect to their susceptibility to develop prostate cancer. it may be noted that status of dyz <dig> was not assessed in the males from either of these populations. based on our study, we presume that besides susceptibility to pc, males from different ethnic and geographical regions may show sequence and copy number variations in the dyz <dig> arrays. however, this warrants a detailed analysis of sufficient number of pc males before a conclusion can be drawn. when, once this issue is fully resolved, dyz <dig> may be added amongst the list of possible bio-marker for dna based diagnosis using pc biopsied samples.

CONCLUSIONS
our study demonstrates that, msy region and sry gene both remain intact in du <dig> and lncap pc cell lines. since, dyz <dig> region is maximally affected both in terms of sequence and array’s copy number; this may be exploited as possible bio-marker for dna based diagnosis of pc together with other marker systems.
