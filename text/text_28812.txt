BACKGROUND
neuronal injury occurring with cerebral hypoxia-ischemia  has been attributed to overstimulation of n-methyl-d-aspartate  and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid  subtypes of glutamate receptors , oxidative stress, and activation of intrinsic program of apoptotic cell death  <cit> . one of the proteins that is induced under hypoxic-ischemic stress and initiates neuronal death program is ‘neuronal pentraxin 1′  . however, how np <dig> contributes to neuronal death is not completely understood. np <dig> is predominantly expressed in the central nervous system  and belongs to the ‘long pentraxins’ family of proteins; np <dig>  neuronal activity-regulated pentraxin , and neuronal pentraxin receptor   <cit> . neuronal pentraxins have high homology among human, mouse and rats  <cit> . the pentraxins have several structural and functional characteristics to form side-to-side and head-to-head multimeric aggregates  <cit>  and the ability to bind other proteins via a lectin-like domain.

proposed functions of nps include modulating synaptic uptake, synapse formation, and synaptic remodeling  <cit> . np <dig> has been reported to mediate synaptic clustering of ampa glutamate receptors  <cit> . in our previous studies, we have shown induction of np <dig> in neonatal mice brain following hi and injury to the cerebral cortex and hippocampal ca <dig> and ca <dig> brain regions  <cit> . we found that the increase in np <dig> induction occurs before the actual cell death, consistent with a role for np <dig> in the injury mechanisms. we also found that np <dig> co-localizes with amap glur <dig> receptors and enhanced glur <dig> membrane insertion at the synaptic sites as evident by np1-glur1-psd- <dig> co-clustering following ogd exposure  <cit> . it is known that various cell death mechanisms require de novo synthesis of both rna and lethal proteins  <cit> , and low neuronal activity triggers the intrinsic program of apoptotic cell death in mature neurons  <cit> . however, how induction of np <dig> expression leads to the propagation of neuronal death or survival of neurons in the absence of np <dig> expression is not completely understood. here, we report that the extracellular secretion of np <dig> is required to induce neuronal death in primary cortical neurons subjected to oxygen glucose deprivation  possibly through co-clustering with apma glur <dig> receptors at synaptic sites and enhanced excitotoxicity. our findings suggest that blockade of np <dig> induction and its extracellular release may be therapeutically relevant against hypoxic-ischemic injury in neonatal brain.

methods
embryonic cortical neuronal culture
the johns hopkins university institutional animal care and use committee approved all animal protocols used; they complied with the us nih guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. primary cortical neuronal cultures were prepared from embryonic day  <dig>  wild-type  and np1-knockout  mice as described previously  <cit> . np <dig> knockout mice were provided by dr. paul worley, dept. of neuroscience, school of medicine, johns hopkins university, baltimore, md, usa. primary cortical neurons were grown in a culture medium consisting of neurobasal™ medium , 2% b <dig> supplement , 2-mm l-glutamine, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin as described previously  <cit> . at 3 days in vitro , one-third of the media was replaced with fresh medium  containing cytosine arabinofuranoside  to arrest the growth of non-neuronal cells. experiments were conducted at div  <dig>  when cultures consisted primarily of neurons  .

induction of ogd, modeled in vitro, using cultured primary cortical neurons
to induce oxygen glucose deprived conditions, cultured cortical neurons at div  <dig> were exposed to ogd as described previously  <cit> . briefly, neurons were placed in glucose-free earl’s balanced salt solution  and then exposed to humidified 95% n2/5% co <dig> using anaerobic modular incubator chambers  for different time periods . control cultures were incubated with ebss with glucose and incubated in humidified 95% air/5% co <dig> for the same duration. after indicated periods of ogd, cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and harvested to examine various biochemical and morphological end points.

sds-page and western blot analyses
sds-page and immunoblotting were performed according to the method as described previously  <cit> . total proteins  were diluted in laemmli buffer containing 2-mercaptoethanol, heated to 95°c for 5 min, separated on a 4-20% gradient tris-glycine precast gel  at 120 v for  <dig>  h. blots were incubated with primary antibodies specific for np <dig> . hrp -conjugated secondary antibodies  were used at 1: <dig> dilutions for 1 h at room temperature. the hrp reaction product was visualized using an ecl western blotting detection kit . image films were scanned in gray scale  at a high resolution as tiff files. immunoreactive protein bands corresponding to the correct molecular mass of target protein were quantified by drawing rectangle around the individual band and the intensity was measured by densitometry using nih imagej software. values were normalized to internal standard actin, which also serve as a loading control, to make relative comparisons.

assessment of cell viability/toxicity
immediately after the indicated periods of ogd exposure, cell viability and cell death was determined by independent and complementary methods as described previously  <cit> .

mtt assay
mitochondrial dehydrogenase activity cleaves 3-- <dig> -diphenyl tetrazolium bromide , which is considered as a biochemical index for cellular viability. a quantitative colorimetric assay of mtt  <cit>  used to determine cell survival as described previously  <cit> . the results were expressed as a percentage of control cultures viability.

ldh assay
lactate dehydrogenase  activity released in the media after ogd exposure was measured using the cytotox <dig> non-radioactive cytotoxicity assay kit  as described previously  <cit> . percent cell death was determined using the formula: % cytotoxicity = ogd-induced ldh release /maximum ldh release  after correcting for baseline absorbance of ldh release at 490 nm.

tunel staining
the deadend fluorometric tunel system  was used to detect cell death in cultured primary cortical neurons exposed to ogd  as described previously  <cit> . this method allows direct detection of nuclear dna fragmentation, an important biochemical hallmark of cell death, by catalytically incorporating fluorescein-12-dutp at 3′-oh dna ends. primary cortical cultures grown on cover slips were processed according to manufacturers’ instructions. negative controls were performed under identical conditions except for the omission of terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase  from the reaction buffer. fluorescein fluorescence was visualized in a fluorescence microscope  with an excitation at 485 nm and an emission at 535 nm. dapi fluorescence  was visualized with an excitation and emission filters at 365 nm and 450 nm, respectively.

short interference rna  directed against np <dig> mrna
for np <dig> gene silencing experiments, we have used ntpx <dig> specific sirna constructs     generated using silencer™ sirna construction kit   and the commercially available control scramble sirna  following methods described previously  <cit> . the oligodeoxyribonucleotide sequences exhibited no similarity to any other known mammalian genes as determined by blast. experimental treatments were initiated ~ 48 h after transfection. using sirna specific for np <dig>  we have achieved >90% reduction in np <dig> protein levels compared to control ssirna.

quantification of np <dig> expression by real-time pcr
total rna was extracted from control and ogd-exposed primary cortical cultures using trizol reagent  according to manufacturer’s protocol. the cdna was synthesized from 1 μg of purified total rna using iscript™ cdna synthesis kit , following the manufacturer’s instructions. quantitative real-time pcr was performed in triplicate by using iq sybr green supermix on cfx96™ real-time system  as described previously  <cit> . the mrna level was normalized by housekeeping gene hprt  <cit> . the primers set used for np <dig>  were 5′-gct gcg aga gcc aga gca cc-3′  and 5′-ttg ccc gag ttg gct gag cg-3′ , and for hprt were 5′-cct ggc gtc gtg att agt gat g-3′  and 5′-cag agg gct aca atg tga tgg c-3′ .

immunofluorescence
live double-immunofluorescence staining of primary cortical cultures  with np <dig> was done as described previously  <cit> . briefly, cortical neurons, grown on coverslips, following exposure to ogd  were live labeled with both anti-np <dig>  and anti-glur <dig>  by adding directly to the medium and further incubated for 45 min at 37°c. neurons were then fixed with  <dig> % formaldehyde, and permeabilized cells were stained with anti-mouse alexa fluor  <dig>  and anti-rabbit alexa fluor  <dig> -conjugated secondary antibodies . slides were coverslipped with prolong mounting medium containing dapi   to stain nuclei. immunofluorescence was visualized using an inverted fluorescence microscope  at  <dig> × and zeiss axioimager m <dig>  at  <dig> × magnification.

statistical analysis
statistics were performed using graphpad prism software, version  <dig> . for one experimental and one control group, two-tailed student’s t-test was used to determine if differences exist between means. comparisons involving multiple groups were done by anova, followed by bonferroni/dunn post-hoc test where appropriate. significance level was assigned at p <  <dig> .

RESULTS
induction of np <dig> in primary cortical neurons exposed to oxygen glucose deprivation
primary cortical neuronal cultures at div <dig> were exposed to ogd for indicated times . control cultures were incubated with ebss containing glucose and exposed to humidified 95% air/5% co <dig> for the same duration of time. light microscopic analysis showed that control neurons were healthy and retained normal morphology, as indicated by larger size, phase brightness and intact processes. whereas, ogd exposed neurons showed characteristic morphological changes of dying cells, which were round, smaller and translucent with disintegration of processes and cell bodies compared to control normoxic neurons . in contrast, np1-ko cortical cultures retained normal neuronal morphology; intact processes and healthy cell bodies against ogd , similar to normoxia control cultures . this in vitro ogd model was used in subsequent experiments to determine the role of np <dig> and its specific requirement for ischemic neuronal death.figure  <dig> 
the ogd time-dependent progression of cytotoxicity in primary cortical neurons. primary cortical cultures at div  <dig> were submitted to ogd conditions for indicated time periods as described in the methods. light microscopic images show morphological evidence of degenerated neurons and disintegration of processes  of wt cortical neurons  and healthy cell bodies with intact processes of np1-ko neurons  observed following ogd exposure as compared to respective normoxia control neurons. scale bar, 100 μm.



next, we asked if np <dig> is induced in cultured primary cortical neurons in response to ogd. the rt-qpcr data showed ogd time-dependent increased expressions of np <dig> mrna  compared to that in normoxia controls . the increased expression of np <dig> mrna was further validated by western blot analyses . western blot analysis of total cellular extracts revealed a np1-specific immunoreactive protein band with apparent molecular mass of ~47 kda consistent with the expected size of np <dig>  <cit> . quantitative densitometry values of np <dig> protein normalized to β-actin  further confirmed ogd time-dependent increase of np <dig> protein levels, which reached the maximum  at 8 h of ogd, examined. the np <dig> protein levels in normoxia controls were low but detectable range.figure  <dig> 
the np <dig> induction is associated with ogd-induced cortical neuronal death. a) total cellular rna was extracted and np <dig> mrna expression levels were analyzed by rt-qpcr. data show relative quantification of nptx <dig> expression at different time periods of ogd exposure. fold induction is the ratio of np <dig> to internal control hprt, which remained stable throughout the ogd period . b) total cellular protein was analyzed by sds-page and immunoblotted for np <dig> protein using np1-specific antibody that detected np1-immunoreactive single band of molecular mass 47 kda. the β-actin serves as loading control. quantitative densitometry values normalized to β-actin  are also shown. representative bands are shown. c & d) ogd exposure of wt cortical neurons caused cell death, while np1-ko neurons were protected against ogd. quantification of cell death as indicated by ldh release showed ogd time dependent increase of ldh release at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and 8 h of ogd exposures of wt cortical neurons. ldh release remained at the control level or non-significant increase in ogd-exposed np1-ko neurons. data are expressed as % ldh release normalized to normoxia control . we found ~ 50% cytotoxicity occurred at 6 h of ogd.



ogd exposure caused cytotoxicity in wt neurons, whereas, np1-ko cortical neurons are protected against ogd
primary cortical neuronal cultures at div  <dig> were exposed to ogd for different time periods . ldh release cytotoxicity assay revealed ogd time-dependent increase in cell death in wt cortical cultures. ogd exposure  resulted 30-50%  cell death in wt cultures . in contrast, we observed very negligible change  in the release of ldh in np1-ko neurons as compared to the wt cells following ogd exposure. interestingly, np1-ko cortical neurons maintained morphological integrity for, at least, 8 h of ogd exposure, which were consistent with cell cytotoxicity as determined by % ldh release .

specific involvement of np <dig> in ogd-induced neuronal death
to determine the specificity of np <dig> induction in neuronal death, we transfected wt primary cortical neurons with either control scramble  or np1-sirna to knockdown np <dig> in wt neurons . using our established protocol, we found that np1-sirna almost completely knockdown np <dig> protein levels  compared to that in cells transfected with control ssirna . here, we asked that if the np <dig> induction is directly associated with neuronal death then knocking down of np <dig> protein will protect cortical neurons against ogd-induced death. ldh cytotoxicity , mtt cell viability  assays and tunel  staining for degenerated neurons  revealed that ogd exposure  resulted significant cell death  in wt neurons transfected with control scramble sirna. in contrast, primary cortical neurons transfected with np1-sirna, showed significantly decreased neurotoxicity and degenerated neurons  when submitted to ogd exposure . our results clearly demonstrate that np <dig> is specifically involved in hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death.figure  <dig> 
knockdown of np <dig> by sirna targeted against np <dig> mrna significantly protected against ogd-induced neuronal death. we have achieved >90% reduction in np <dig> protein compared to scramble sirna . ldh cytotoxicity and mtt cell viability  showed significantly less cell death in np1-sirna transfected wt cells vs. non-transfected cells following exposure to ogd . data are expressed as percent ldh release normalized to normoxia control  c) tunel staining of cortical neurons transfected with either control scramble or np1-sirna revealed significant increase in the number of tunel  cells in scramble ssirna transfected cultures, which was significantly reduced in np1-sirna transfected neurons. data are expressed as percent tunel/dapi cells .



enhanced neuronal death induced by conditioned media  from ogd-exposed wt primary cortical cultures
because of the secretory nature of np <dig> , we asked if np <dig> induction is associated with hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death, then extracellularly secreted np <dig> might be also contributing to the neuronal death observed. we collected the conditioned media  from control and ogd exposed wt cortical cultures  and concentrated using microsep™ 30k omega centrifugal devices . western blot analysis of wt control and ogd-exposed cm confirmed ogd time-dependent increase of np <dig> protein levels present in the wt-ogd cm . after confirming the presence of np <dig> in the wt-ogd cm, we added this cm to a subset of control cortical cultures at div  <dig> and incubated for additional 24 h. an additional group of the same cm-treated cultures were also exposed to ogd . ldh release cytotoxicity assay revealed that addition of wt-ogd cm to control normoxia cultures resulted significant cell death  similar to that observed with ogd exposed wt cultures . in addition, ogd exposure of the wt-ogd cm treated neurons further enhanced the cytotoxicity  .figure  <dig> 
ogd-conditioned culture media caused increased neuronal death in cortical neuronal cultures. primary cortical cultures at div  <dig> were exposed to ogd and conditioned media  were collected, centrifuged and concentrated as described in the methods. a) western blot analysis of cm from ogd-exposed wt primary cortical cultures showed ogd time-dependent increase of np <dig> protein levels. b) this cm of ogd exposed wt cultures  was added to a subset of control cortical cultures for 24 h . in addition, another subgroup of cells was also exposed to 6 h of ogd . data shown are mean ± sem  and repeated two times, **p <  <dig>  vs. normoxia controls; +p <  <dig>  vs. ogd only and control + wt-ogd cm group.



to specifically examine the role of np <dig> in neuronal death, we used cm collected separately from control, ogd-exposed wt  and np1-ko cortical cultures , concentrated as above, added to separate subsets of wt and np1-ko cultures at div  <dig>  and incubated for additional for 24 h . most interestingly, we found that wt-ogd cm caused neuronal death  when added to normal wt cultures . in contrast, the cm from ogd exposed np1-ko  did not cause any degeneration of processes and cell bodies and maintained normal neuronal morphology  when added to the normoxia wt cultures  similar to control cultures. on the other hand, wt-ogd cm caused neuronal death when added to np1-ko cultures , which otherwise showed neuroprotection against ogd. our findings confirm the specific involvement of np <dig> in neuronal death and neuronal survival in the absence of np <dig> protein expression. taken together, our results clearly demonstrate the role of extracellular np <dig> in ischemic neuronal death.figure  <dig> 
absence of np <dig> protein in np1-ko ogd conditioned medium does not cause neuronal death in wt normoxia cortical cultures. morphological evidence of degenerated cell bodies and processes reveal that wt ogd cm induced neuronal degeneration in control wt cultures  whereas, ogd conditioned np1-ko cm did not cause cell death in wt cultures . in contrast, np1-ko cortical cultures, which are protected against ogd, showed neuronal death when treated with wt-ogd cm . representative light microscopic images are shown, n =  <dig>  scale, 100 μm.



presence of np <dig> protein in the cm, but not the np <dig>  is involved in ogd-induced neurotoxicity
to further validate the specificity of np <dig> in neurotoxicity, we added cm from ogd-exposed np2-ko cultures  to a subset of wt normal cortical cultures. as we have observed in figure 4b and 5a, the ldh release cytotoxicity assay showed significantly increased neurotoxicity  when the np2-ko ogd cm was added to normal wt cortical cultures , similar to that observed in case of wt-ogd cm . western blot analysis of np2-ko ogd cm revealed increased levels of np <dig> protein present in the cm from ogd-exposed np2-ko cortical cultures. our results clearly delineate the involvement of np <dig>  but not the np <dig>  in ischemic neuronal death following ogd, suggesting the specificity of np <dig> in the neuronal injury mechanisms.figure  <dig> 
np2-ko ogd conditioned medium caused neurotoxicity and death in wt normoxia cortical cultures. quantification of cell death by ldh release assay revealed significantly higher percentage of cell death when wt-ogd cm was added to wt control cultures . b) the np2-ko ogd cm caused similar extent of cytotoxicity when added to the wt control cultures as compared to control cm . similarly, the np2-ko ogd cm in combination with ogd further enhanced cell death. data shown are mean ± sem  and repeated two times, **p <  <dig>  vs. normoxia controls. c) western blot analysis of ogd exposed np2-ko cm showed ogd time-dependent increased levels of np <dig> protein present in the np2-ko ogd cm, suggesting np <dig>  but not the np <dig>  contributes to neuronal death. representative bands are shown.



surface clustering of extracellular np <dig> with ampa glur <dig> receptors
previously we reported that ogd exposure promotes redistribution of ampa glur <dig> receptors at the postsynaptic membrane and significantly increased the np1-glur <dig> interactions at synaptic sites as evidenced by the higher percentage of np1/psd- <dig> co-localization and co-clustering with glur <dig> under similar ogd conditions  <cit> . we asked if extracellular release of np <dig> following ogd interacts with glur <dig>  live immunostaining with both np <dig> and glur <dig> antibodies showed intense increase of np1-glur <dig> co-clustering in the dendrites and axons of the ogd-exposed cortical neurons compared to the normoxia controls . our results suggest a relationship between extracellular release of np <dig> following np <dig> induction and synaptic clustering of glur <dig>  which in turn promote ogd-induced neuronal death.figure  <dig> 
extracellular release of np <dig> protein following ogd enhances interaction between np <dig> and glur <dig> at the synaptic sites. live immunostaining of div  <dig> primary cortical neurons with np <dig> and glur <dig> antibodies following ogd . immunofluorescence microscopy and merged images show increased number of np <dig>  and glur <dig>  co-localized clusters  at cortical dendrites and axons. representative images are shown, n =  <dig>  scale, 100 μm.



discussion
we found increased levels of np <dig> protein in the cm from ogd-exposed wt primary cortical neuronal cultures, and this cm caused substantial neurotoxicity when added to control cortical cultures. most strikingly, the cm from ogd-exposed np1-ko cortical cultures did not induce neurotoxicity to normal cortical cultures under identical conditions, and that np1-ko cells maintained characteristic features of healthy neuronal morphology with intact processes. first, we found induction of np <dig> following ogd exposure of cortical neurons and neuronal death, whereas, inhibition of np <dig> expression by np1-specific sirna exerts neuroprotection against ogd. our findings suggest that np <dig>  being a secretory protein, after induction following ogd undergoes release from neurons and this extracellular np <dig> is involved in ischemic neuronal death. here, we present evidence that extracellular secretion of np <dig> protein following exposure to ogd is necessary to induce ischemic neuronal death, suggesting a new extracellular pro-death function of np <dig> 

previously we have reported a role for np <dig> in neonatal hypoxic-ischemic brain injury and subcellular localization of np <dig> in to mitochondria enhanced mitochondria-mediated neuronal death . we also reported interactions of np1with excitatory ampa glur <dig> receptors and direct regulation of surface glur <dig> expression and synaptic clustering of np <dig> with glur <dig>  <cit> . these findings suggest the possibility that presynaptic npr which binds to np1; allowing np <dig> to trans-synaptically attach to the extracellular domain of glur <dig> at the postsynaptic specialization, thereby facilitating glutamate binding and, thus, enhancing excitotoxicity. in contrast, np1-ko neurons showed reduced cytotoxicity by limiting synaptic glur <dig> cluster formation due to absence of extracellular np <dig> at synaptic sites. we also found that this clustering activity involves physical association between np <dig> and glur <dig>  and that np <dig> exhibited profound synaptic co-clustering with glur <dig> following ogd  <cit> . thus, it is possible that extracellular np <dig> may disrupt inter-neuronal synaptic activity, which possibly contributes to the neuronal death in hypoxic-ischemic brain injury via clustering with glur <dig> 

based on cdna sequence, np <dig> is predicted to be secreted protein  <cit> , raising the possibility that it is present on the neuronal surface that enhances the toxicity of neuronal cells under hypoxic-ischemic stress. we performed a series of experiments to evaluate the importance of extracellular np <dig> in hypoxic-ischemic neuronal death. hypoxic-ischemic neuronal injury is triggered by the activation of glutamatergic excitotoxicity cascade  <cit>  and several downstream cytotoxic pathways  <cit> . it appear from our present findings that np <dig> is induced and released following ogd and recruited to surface glur <dig> subunits to form clusters at excitatory synapses, and increased np1-glur <dig> interactions sensitize neurons to ogd- induced neuronal death. these members of the long-pentraxin family, np <dig> and np <dig>  are exclusively expressed in the central neurons and are secretory from cells upon pathological stress. to further delineate the role of secretory nps in neuronal death, we found that it is np <dig> protein, not the np <dig>  is involved in neuronal death as evident by our findings that the cm from the ogd-exposed np2-ko cortical cultures caused neuronal death when added to the normal cortical cultures similar to that induced by wt-ogd cm. the role of np <dig> in neuronal death is also evidenced by the presence of increased amount of np <dig> protein in the np2-ko cm that caused neurotoxicity.

CONCLUSIONS
collectively, our results argue that extracellular secretion of np <dig> following ogd provides a mechanism that potentiates ischemic neuronal death possibly via ampa glur1-mediated function at the excitatory synapses, and that np <dig>  not its family member np <dig>  is involved in neuronal death mechanisms. our results suggest np <dig> as a practical target for preventing ischemic neuronal death.
