BACKGROUND
s. aureus is a globally important human pathogen, causing a variety of diseases such as pneumonia, skin and soft tissue infections, blood-stream infections, osteomyelitis, and endocarditis, as well as toxin-mediated syndromes like toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning  <cit> . since the onset of the pandemic waves of mrsa over the past decades, it has become the most common cause of both hospital- and community-acquired infection worldwide  <cit> . according to epidemiological data in  <dig>  the mean prevalence of mrsa across china was more than 50%, and in shanghai, the rate was over 80%  <cit> . to control the spread of mrsa in hospitals, measures such as universal hand hygiene practices have been introduced into shanghai teaching hospitals. however, as yet there are no programs to screen for asymptomatic mrsa carriers in chinese hospitals. a re-evaluation of the level of mrsa infection in shanghai teaching hospitals is required to evaluate the effect of the current infection control measures.

the major mrsa clones that cause infections worldwide belong to five pandemic mrsa lineages: cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  cc <dig>  and cc <dig>  <cit> . some virulence genes show strong associations with specific molecular types; for instance, the sea, sek, and seq genes were identified in all st <dig> strains. in contrast, st <dig> was strongly associated with the tst, seg, sei, sem, sen, and seo gene profiles  <cit> . conversely, the expression of core genome-encoded virulence genes varies between molecular types of s. aureus <cit> , indicating that discrete sequence types  may correlate with specific infection types. for example, the mrsa clone usa <dig> mainly causes skin and soft tissue infections  in the united states  <cit> . to the best of our knowledge, there is limited information characterizing the latest hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in hospitals in shanghai, china. therefore, we sought to determine the prevalence, molecular characteristics, and genotype-phenotype correlation of hospital-acquired s. aureus infections at one of the largest teaching hospitals in shanghai.

RESULTS
the population composition and types of infection caused by s. aureus
the clinical and demographic characteristics of the inpatients with s. aureus infection are listed in table  <dig>  among the  <dig> hospital-acquired s. aureus isolates obtained between january and december  <dig>  there were  <dig>  mrsa isolates and  <dig>  mssa isolates. from the clinical medical records, respiratory infection was the most frequently determined infection type caused by s. aureus;  <dig> %  of the isolates were from the respiratory tract, and most of the s. aureus isolates recovered from respiratory infection were mrsa . conversely, only  <dig> %  of isolates recovered from skin/soft tissue infections were methicillin resistant.

the sts of current mrsa and mssa epidemic strains in huashan hospital
all s. aureus isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing . there were  <dig> distinct sts identified within the  <dig> isolates , among which the most frequently represented were st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , st <dig> , and st <dig> . mssa isolates were associated with all  <dig> sts, with st <dig>  and st <dig>  being the two dominant types for mssa isolates. mrsa st <dig> was mainly recovered from respiratory specimens  and sterile body fluids , but was only found at a frequency of  <dig> % and  <dig> % in skin/soft tissue and blood infections, respectively. st <dig> isolates were most often present in respiratory specimens  and blood , but were isolated at a frequency of only  <dig> % and  <dig> % from sterile body fluids and skin/soft tissue samples, respectively. st <dig> strains were mainly found in urine samples . most other dispersed sts were associated with mssa strains causing skin/soft tissue infection  and bacteremia  .

sccmec types of  <dig> mrsa isolates from huashan hospital
sccmec types i–v were detected in this study. of the  <dig> mrsa strains,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % ,  <dig> % , and  <dig> %  were sccmec types i–v, respectively. three mrsa strains carrying sccmec were defined as non-typeable  . the predominant sts amongst the mrsa isolates were st239-sccmeciii  and st5-sccmecii . the other two most common mrsa sts were st1-sccmeciv  and st59-sccmeciv. st239-sccmeci, st239-sccmecii, st5-sccmeciii, and st5-sccmeciv strains were also detected in huashan hospital.

*sts with less than  <dig> isolates were not calculated in the percentage of sccmec type.

antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
we analyzed 608 s. aureus isolates with  <dig> different sts for antimicrobial resistance . all the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. resistance to penicillin  was observed most frequently, and st <dig> and st <dig> strains had significantly higher multiple antibiotic-resistance profiles when compared with other sts. st <dig> strains were more susceptible to rifampicin  and sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim  but more resistant to fosfomycin  than st <dig>  st <dig> isolates were susceptible to most antibiotics except penicillin , levofloxacin , cefoxitin , and cefazolin , while st <dig> strains were susceptible to most of the antibiotics except penicillin , levofloxacin , and erythromycin . st <dig> strains were only resistant to penicillin . in this study,  <dig> isolates of animal infection-associated st <dig> were identified, all of which were susceptible to cefoxitin. these isolates were only resistant to penicillin  and erythromycin .

a sts with less than  <dig> isolates were not calculated in the percentage of antibiotic resistance.

association of genotypes, and detection of the pvl, mupa, and qaca/b genes
ten  isolates were pvl-positive, and they displayed six different sts . four  pvl-positive isolates were st <dig>  two  isolates belonged to st <dig>  and one isolate each belonged to st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  with the exception of one st <dig> and one st <dig> mrsa isolate, all of the pvl-positive isolates were mssa. sixty  isolates were mupa-positive, and they displayed  <dig> different sts. twenty-one  mupa-positive isolates were st <dig>  twenty  isolates belonged to st <dig>  and seven  isolates belonged to st <dig>  there were two isolates each of st <dig>  st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  and one isolate belonged to each of the sts st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig>  most of the mupa-positive isolates were mrsa . seventy-two  isolates were qaca/b-positive and displayed eight different sts. thirty-eight  and twenty-eight  qaca/b-positive isolates were st <dig> and st <dig>  respectively, while the overall frequency of mrsa-type qaca/b-positive isolates was  <dig> % .

a sts with less than  <dig> isolates were not calculated in the percentage of genes present or mrsa/mssa.

the prevalence of different genotypes in different wards
to investigate whether there were epidemic s. aureus clones that could survive and spread in different wards, we next analyzed the icu, one of the largest comprehensive surgical wards, and two of the largest medical wards. as shown in figure  <dig>  different sts were detected in different wards, and each ward had its own dominant sts. st <dig> was a robust sequence type, and was prevalent in the icu and surgical ward, while st <dig> was prevalent in both medical wards and surgical wards. in medical wards, st <dig>  st <dig>  and st <dig> were the predominant three clones, whilst isolates belonging to other sts were recovered at a rate of three isolates per month. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  was used to compare the genetic variation of the dominant sts recovered from different wards. figure  <dig>  showed that the restriction profiles of the same epidemic s. aureus clones originating from the same wards were not identical. the major dna restriction pattern was named type a, and isolates with closely  or possibly related  restriction patterns were considered subtypes of a, and were designated type a <dig>  type a <dig>  and so on. those with more than six fragment differences were regarded as type b  <cit> . pfge type a <dig> was the major pattern of the prevalent clone st <dig> in the icu, but the pfge patterns of prevalent clone st <dig> in medical ward  <dig> were more dispersed.

discussion
surveillance data from china suggested that s. aureus infections account for a substantial burden of disease  <cit> . most of the individuals infected with hospital-onset s. aureus in this study were men , which was consistent with findings from a previous study  <cit> . unlike the incidence of community-onset s. aureus, which is highest in the younger age groups  <cit> , hospital-acquired s. aureus usually causes infections in immunocompromised populations aged 55 years or above. in our study, more than 60% of s. aureus isolates were isolated from this group, suggesting that the biology and pathogenesis of community-acquired s. aureus differs from that of hospital-acquired s. aureus. since the 1980s, mrsa has become a serious clinical problem worldwide. in shanghai, the mean prevalence of mrsa was over 80% in  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, it is very important to restrict the spread of mrsa in both hospitals and community settings. to control mrsa transmission, measures such as universal hand hygiene practices were introduced into shanghai teaching hospitals in  <dig>  this study demonstrated that mrsa healthcare-onset infections were still extremely frequent  in the central teaching hospital in shanghai in  <dig>  despite the application of infection control measures.

previous data demonstrated that the epidemic mrsa clones in asian countries belong to cc <dig>  and cc <dig> . the st <dig> mrsa clone was first discovered in brazil and has since become widely disseminated in various hospitals  <cit> . st <dig> has been the dominant clone in most of the cities in china since  <dig>  <cit> . in our study, st239-sccmeciii still presented as the most frequent mrsa st, with st5-sccmecii identified as the second most common epidemic mrsa clone. this clone was initially described as the main clone in the united states  <cit>  and japan  <cit> , and was subsequently detected in china  <cit> . st239-sccmeci, st239-sccmecii, st5-sccmeciii, and st5-sccmeciv were also detected in this study. the occurrence of different sccmec types in the same mrsa clonal lineage led to the hypothesis that these elements were acquired independently at several times through horizontal gene transfer  <cit> . multidrug-resistant clones st <dig> and st <dig> mainly caused respiratory-related infection in our study. this could explain why  <dig> % of isolates recovered from patients with respiratory infections were mrsa. st <dig> strains were isolated at a frequency of only  <dig>  and  <dig> % from skin/soft tissue and blood, respectively. st <dig> strains were isolated from  <dig> % of skin/soft tissue samples in this study, which was lower than in the study of yu et al.  <cit> , who demonstrated that st <dig> strains accounted for only  <dig> % of bloodstream infections. we found that st <dig> isolates were more susceptible to rifampicin and sulfamethoxazole plus trimethoprim, but more resistant to fosfomycin, than st <dig> strains. this implies that appropriate drug selection based on different mrsa types may reduce the reservoir of drug-resistant bacteria. different sts were associated with different virulence profiles, and the expression of core genome-encoded virulence genes differed between discrete molecular types of s. aureus <cit> . this could explain in part why different clonal types may be associated with specific infection types. li et al.  <cit>  recently identified a novel surface-anchored protein, sasx, as a crucial factor in promoting nasal colonization, immune evasion, and virulence, and as a probable main driving force of the asian st <dig> mrsa epidemic. therefore, possible mechanisms for the st <dig> mrsa epidemic in this region should be assessed in future studies.

the other two common mrsa sts were st1-sccmeciv and st59-sccmeciv, which closely resemble those of the well-known epidemic ca-mrsa clones. st <dig> bears the same st as mw <dig> , which was the first ca-mrsa strain reported in the united states  <cit> . the major asian ca-mrsa strain was st59-sccmeciv  <cit> , and was reported to be prevalent in skin and soft tissue infections. the molecular characteristics of the mssa isolates were genetically diverse in this study, and most mssa strains caused skin/soft tissue infection and bacteremia. st <dig> and st <dig> were the two dominant types. st <dig> was a double-locus variant of st <dig>  which was the predicted founder of the community-acquired st <dig> type. sixteen animal-associated clone types, including  <dig> st <dig> and one st <dig>  were also found in the present study. human infections caused by st <dig> isolates have been reported in many countries  <cit> . all of the st <dig> isolates in this study were mssa, and four carried the gene coding for pvl. pvl is suggested to be an important virulence factor in ca-mrsa isolates, and there is a strong epidemiological association between pvl genes and successful ca-mrsa lineages, especially in skin/soft tissue disease  <cit> . our data suggest that the external community acted as a significant reservoir of mrsa/mssa strains related to the skin/soft tissue disease that occurred in hospitals. for this reason, traditional infection control strategies aimed solely at the prevention of mrsa/mssa transmission in hospitals may be ineffective. new approaches, including public health measures that focus on the community as a source of mrsa/mssa, are needed to control this epidemic.

in  <dig>  infection control measures were introduced into shanghai teaching hospitals to help control the spread of mrsa. surface-active antiseptics such as chlorhexidine were strongly recommended as decolonization agents in our hospital, especially in the icu and surgical wards. emerging resistance to the use of these kinds of antiseptics was a particular concern. the qaca/b genes were found in  <dig> % of the s. aureus clinical isolates in our study. most of the qaca/b-positive clones were mrsa st <dig> and st <dig>  which are very prevalent in the icu and surgical ward, suggesting that the over-use of antiseptic agents has led to the emergence of mrsa strains with decreased antiseptic susceptibility. mupirocin treatment was another comprehensive strategy in reducing s. aureus colonization and infection in the hospital  <cit> . in our study,  <dig> % of isolates were mupa-positive, and the majority of mupa -positive isolates were mrsa types st <dig> and st <dig>  mupirocin resistance in s. aureus, especially in mrsa, has been reported in many studies  <cit> . mcneil et al. showed that 11% of s. aureus isolates from children with recurrent skin and soft tissue infections carried mupa. thus, detection of mupirocin resistance in s. aureus, particularly in mrsa, is necessary to maintain the usefulness of this agent for the treatment of s. aureus infections and for infection control.

the rates of hospital-acquired s. aureus infection varied between the different departments of huashan hospital. during the 12 months of this study,  <dig> patients were hospitalized in the icu for an aggregate of  <dig>  days, sustaining  <dig> hospital-acquired s. aureus infections. the rate of hospital-acquired s. aureus infection was  <dig>  per  <dig> icu-days. the other  <dig>  patients were hospitalized in different wards for an aggregate of  <dig>  days, sustaining  <dig> hospital-acquired s. aureus infections. the overall rate of hospital-acquired s. aureus infection in the other wards was  <dig>  per  <dig> hospitalized days. therefore, hospital-acquired s. aureus infections in the icu of the shanghai teaching hospital pose a greater threat to patient safety than those in the other wards.

finally, we found each ward had its own dominant sts. this is possibly because different sts exhibit distinct virulence profiles, and each st is related to specific infection types. in this study, we observed that the strains with the same mlst types did not necessarily have the same pfge profiles. pfge can detect genetic variation that accumulates relatively rapidly, and even minor genetic changes  can produce a three-fragment difference in the pfge gel banding pattern  <cit> . insertions, deletions, or the presence of plasmids can alter the pfge pattern without necessarily changing the dna sequence of the seven housekeeping genes used for mlst, creating diversity in pfge patterns in the face of homogeneity among mlst patterns obtained for the same isolates. from this point of view, pfge is more informative than mlst as it involves random screening of the entire genome, whereas mlst analysis is limited to nucleotides within the targeted genes.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, the present data indicate that there is still a high prevalence of mrsa infections in the teaching hospital in shanghai, china. the current infection control measures have failed to reduce rates of mrsa infections to acceptable levels for decolonization. the high proportion of multidrug-resistant and chlorhexidine-based antiseptic-resistant clones st <dig> and st <dig> in the icu and surgical wards supports the need for more effective infection control measures to curtail the colonization and dissemination of mrsa to hospitalized patients.
