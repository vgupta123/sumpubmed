BACKGROUND
as one of the most successful vertebrate colonizers in subterranean habitats, cavefishes attract interest because of their unusual regressive features, such as the rudimentary eyes and scales, and loss of pigmentation. as possible compensation, some constructive traits have evolved, such as elongated appendages and non-visual sensory systems  <cit> . nevertheless, biologists have long puzzled over these troglomorphic characters  <cit> , and the study of their relationship to their environment has been largely ignored  <cit> . although recent work on a traditional model, astyanax mexicanus, revealed some important advances  <cit> , especially in aspects of eye loss  <cit>  and identifying candidate genes underlying quantitative trait loci   <cit> , there is no whole genomic data available to unravel the evolution and general adaptation to dark subterranean life among other groups of distinct but closely-related cavefishes.

sinocyclocheilus  is endemic to china’s massive southwestern karst area, the northern part of which abuts the eastern part of the qinghai-tibetan plateau. this genus serves as an emerging cavefish model for its high species diversity and the phenotypic variation which has evolved in karst river systems. in a previous science letter in  <dig>  <cit> , we reported a global hotspot of biodiversity and the threats to it through a survey of cave species in southwestern china, with an illustration of a sinocyclocheilus cavefish, s. rhinocerous, which was collected from yunnan province. the present study deals with whole genome and transcriptome sequencing of three sinocyclocheilus species : the surface-dwelling s. grahami ; the semi-cave-dwelling s. rhinocerous ; and the cave-restricted s. anshuiensis . these species were carefully chosen as representatives of three key nodes on the path to obligate cave life, although almost all sinocyclocheilus species show some cave-related traits and habits  <cit> . we investigate whether whole genomic data would provide some clues about genetic adaptations to subterranean habitats, and whether the strict co-occurrence of the karstic landscape and sinocyclocheilus species might serve to reveal aspects of the biogeographic history of the uplift of the qinghai-tibetan plateau.fig.  <dig> comparison of biological traits, habitat and basic genomic information for the three sequenced sinocyclocheilus species. they are representative of surface-dwelling , semi-cave-dwelling  and cave-restricted  species, respectively. please note the regressive characters in the adult sa, such as loss of eyes, little scale covering and translucent skin



RESULTS
genome assembly, assessment and annotation
high-quality genomic dna was extracted from muscle tissues of the three sinocyclocheilus species, which were collected from yunnan  and guangxi  provinces in china . a series of sequencing libraries  were constructed and applied in a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy, and a total of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  gb of raw data were obtained for the sg, sr and sa fishes, respectively . the assembled genome sizes are approximately  <dig>  gb , and the calculated contig n <dig> and scaffold n <dig> values are 17– <dig> kb and  <dig> – <dig>  mb, respectively . the quality of the three genome assemblies was evaluated , and our assessment confirmed that all were high in quality and could be used for further comparative analyses. in addition, we employed a standard annotation pipeline to predict gene sets, resulting in approximately  <dig>  genes in the three fish genomes , which were double that of most diploid species . the further hox gene distribution analyses in three sinocyclocheilus species  and genome alignment between zebrafish and sg  provided more evidence to support the tetraploid nature of sinocyclocheilus.

phylogenetic relationships and divergence time
the collision between india and asia in the early cenozoic may have been the largest-ever orogenic event in the earth’s history  <cit> . it not only triggered the extraordinary uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau  <cit> , but also profoundly influenced the asian climate through the genesis of the asian monsoon  <cit> , the development of large-scale drainage patterns  <cit> , and especially, the speciation and biodiversity of the organisms living on and below the plateau . because sinocyclocheilus, the most species-rich cyprinid genus, is endemic to the massive southwestern karst area , it has been proposed that the development of this diversity was correlated with the cyclic uplift and planation of the qinghai-tibet plateau  <cit> . both the phylogenetic analyses of single-copy orthologous genes and of the mitochondrial dna datasets  supported this correlation, recovering the same relationships for the three sinocyclocheilus species studied here . the generated chronogram revealed that sr emerged first from the other two species at  <dig>  ma, and sg divided from sa at  <dig>  ma. these divergence times are similar to those obtained for other speciation events of congeners inferred from a more comprehensive study of cyprininae phylogeny  <cit> . these splitting events occurred during the initial and final phases, respectively, of the second tectonic uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau , a time when evidence shows that the limestone region they lived in had been experiencing large-scale karst development  <cit> . the frequent capture and isolation of the subterranean river systems along with the karst development were regarded as the key reasons for speciation in this genus  <cit> , although the complete picture will remain unknown until more species have been examined. the ancient separation revealed here might be one of the reasons to explain the high species diversity within a relatively narrow distribution area  .fig.  <dig> phylogenomic analysis and demographic histories of the three sinocyclocheilus species. a phylogenomic relationships inferred from  <dig>  orthologous genes of the three sinocyclocheilus and six other teleost species , with the branch lengths scaled to estimated divergence times . the numbers besides the branch indicated expanded  and contracted  gene families since the split from a most recent common ancestor . b demographic histories were reconstructed using the pairwise sequentially markovian coalescent  model. the uplift process of the qinghai-tibet plateau since  <dig>  ma was obtained from a published paper  <cit>  and other significant environmental events, such as the atmospheric surface air temperature and eurasian ice volume for the past 3 ma, were taken from the national centers for environmental information . the time range of three rounds of intense uplift  is highlighted in lilac. all three species have similar patterns of decrease under the qingzang and kunhuang movement, but a subsequent divergent trend under the gonghe movement



population history
a reconstruction of the population demography of the three sinocyclocheilus species has revealed a similar start but a subsequent divergent trend from  <dig> to 107 years ago . it seems that the population demography has a greater correlation with the uplifting of the qinghai-tibet plateau than other significant environmental events, such as the eurasian ice volume or the atmospheric surface air temperature. in a relatively short period of time , all three species underwent two rounds of population decline, which occurred following two intense uplift phases in the third tectonic uplift of the qinghai-tibet plateau  <cit> . these two phases of movements at qingzang  and kunhuang  uplifted the plateau from an average of < <dig>  m up to  <dig>  m, followed by the intensification of the asian monsoon and increased precipitation  <cit> , in addition to the large-scale development of glaciers  <cit> . the patterns of coincident population declines in the three species are believed to be a response of a common background following the intense uplift of the plateau that may have been unfavorable to them . however, two events of unusual population expansion were also detected after these events. one was recognized in sr during the interglacial period , a period during which sg and sa kept their low populations, which hints at the presence of extensive subterranean water systems in the sr-native luoping basin at this time. another was observed for sg from  <dig>  ma when its main distribution area, the paleo-lake dianchi, was coincidentally documented from geological sediments to have been some three times larger than at present  <cit> . range expansion along new river channels might accompany plateau uplift, thereby providing some fish the opportunity to increase their population sizes as reported in the typical plateau schizothoracine fish schizopygopsis pylzovi  <cit>  and gymnocypris chilianensis  <cit> .

variations of eye structures and related genetic and expression responses
cavefishes often display regressive features, such as the degeneration of the eyes, which often develop normally during embryogenesis but subsequently arrest, degenerate or sink beneath the skin  <cit> . in the three adult sinocyclocheilus fishes in this study, sg has normal-sized eyes with a lens and retinal structures; sr has small eyes with a reduced lens and retinal cell density; and sa has lost its external eyeballs and lens, and the retina has degenerated to become merely disorganized and indistinguishable cellular layers . the recently published a. mexicanus genome identified many specific candidate genes under eye-related qtl, and revealed expression differences in several development stages  <cit> . in our study, we analyzed the genetic changes of these existing crystallin and opsin genes and also presented copy number variations among cave-dwelling and surface-dwelling fishes. our comparative genomic data suggested that several opsin genes, including lws <dig> , rh2- <dig> and rh2- <dig> , have been lost in sinocyclocheilus, and that rh2- <dig> has been lost in sa . in dim conditions, long wavelength light is rapidly attenuated  <cit> , and it seems rational that the long and middle wavelength-sensitive genes were lost specifically in sa. the results from transcriptomic analyses of eyes also unsurprisingly showed significantly lower expression levels of most visual opsin genes in sa when compared with sg and sr . development and maintenance of photoreceptors requires a series of transcriptional factors. as expected, nine important transcriptional factors, including crx, nrl, otx <dig>  otx <dig>  nr2e <dig>  ggca1a, gnat <dig>  gnat <dig> and rorb, were significantly down-regulated in sa . these results are consistent with those found for astyanax cavefishes  <cit>  and for other sinocyclocheilus species  <cit> , which supports the hypothesis that down-regulation of rhodopsin might play a critical role in eye degradation of cavefishes  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparison of retinal structures among the three sinocyclocheilus species. phenotypes and h&e stained sections of eyes from top to bottom are those in a sg, b sr and c sa, respectively. gcl, ganglion cell layer; inl, inner nuclear layer; ipl, inner plexiform layer; is, inner segment; onl, outer nuclear layer; opl, outer plexiform layer; os, outer segment; rcl, relict cell layer; rpe, retinal pigmented epithelium



by screening crystallin genes in the three sinocyclocheilus genomes, we found that copy numbers of most genes were lower than those of the diploid zebrafish . transcriptomic data further demonstrated that the expression levels of most crystallin genes were maintained at high levels in sg, but were not expressed in sa . we also observed that several crystallin genes in sa  have evolved into pseudogenes due to existing premature stop codons . previous studies in astyanax found that the expression of crystallin genes were down-regulated in the development of cavefish lens  <cit> , suggesting that the lens plays a critical role in promoting cell survival in the development of eyes  <cit> . in particular, β- and γ-crystallins play a pivotal role in retinal tissue remodeling and repair, and also strongly enhance axon regeneration of retinal ganglion cells  <cit> . hence, the lack, or down-regulation, of crystallin gene expression in sa supports its phenotype of a visual system in which both the lens and retina have degenerated. interestingly, we also found that sa has two copies of hsp90α <dig>  and hsp90a <dig>   genes, while both sg and sr have only one. meanwhile, the expression levels of hsp90α in sa eyes were much higher than those in sg and sr . these observations provide further evidence to support a novel role of hsp90α in lens apoptosis and eye degeneration of cavefishes  <cit> .

different mechanisms of albinism compared with astyanax
in order to check the mechanisms of loss of pigmentation in sa skin, we compared melanogenesis-related genes in the three sinocyclocheilus genomes. in astyanax, the albinism of some cave populations is caused by the deletions of oca <dig> gene exon regions, which disturbs the upstream steps of the melanin synthesis pathway  <cit> . although similar deletions of oca <dig> genes were not found in either of the two copies in sa , nor were any identical mutations specifically present in sa and astyanax cave populations, some other new mutations were identified , and the transcriptome analysis performed on the skin of sg, sr and sa indicated that the expression of oca <dig> gene in sa was the lowest . in the melanin synthesis pathway, several enzymes work downstream, such as tyr , a key rate-limiting enzyme, and tyrp <dig>   <cit> . more interestingly, we found that tyr has an amino acid mutation  in sa , which was identical to that identified in caucasian human patients   <cit> . meanwhile, the expression levels of sa genes in the melanogenesis pathway in the skin transcriptomes were the lowest, especially tyr and tyrp <dig>  with significantly lower expression levels in sa compared with sg . it seems that similar phenotypes in sinocyclocheilus cavefish might evolve by different mechanisms from astyanax. furthermore, we found that the mpv <dig> protein in sa had a deletion in the signal region compared with zebrafish, sg and sr , and the expression level of mpv <dig> in sa is the lowest . a previous study shows that the deletion in mpv <dig> can cause the tra mutant phenotype in zebrafish, and cause a loss  of iridophores throughout larval and adult stages  <cit> . this study also pointed out that differentiated iridophores were required for the accumulation and maintenance of melanophores during pigment pattern formation  <cit> , and a parallel study showed that the interaction between iridophores and other chromatophores is critical in the stripe formation of zebrafish  <cit> . thus we infer that the deletion of mpv <dig> might cause the loss of iridophores, which affected the formation of melanophores, and consequently played a role in the albinism of sa.

gene mutation and loss in scale degeneration
a previous study has indicated that mutations in the ectodysplasin-a receptor  encoding locus can lead to complete scale loss in fish such as medaka  <cit> . for this reason, two copies of edar gene  in the three sinocyclocheilus genomes were identified and checked. interestingly, one of the proteins, edar <dig>  has deletions in the signal peptide and partial extracellular regions in all three sinocyclocheilus species, which may lead to functional changes or loss in this copy . for the other protein copy, edar <dig>  only sa has the signal peptide region and partial extracellular regions totally deleted when compared with sg and sr . this deletion in sa may lead to a functional disorder in guiding the edar protein transfer across the membrane, thus generating fewer scales at the skin surface of sa . coincidentally, two important genes, lamb <dig> and col7a, were also lost from the sa genome, which may cause a defect in the anchoring between the epidermis and dermis, resulting in friction and skin fragility  <cit>  in the scale covering.

possible hearing loss in sa
the hearing of cavefishes is interesting but less studied than the other functions discussed above. we found the deletion of mpv <dig> gene, which we mentioned in the section on albinism, may also have some influence in hearing. a previous study reported that mpv17-deficient mice suffered from degeneration of cochlea and loss of sensorineural hearing at 2 months old  <cit> . another gene, ush2a, has also changed in sa, especially two amino acid sites, r334s  <cit>  and v382a  <cit>  , which may affect splicing and the termination codon . it has been proved that the encoded protein of ush is found in the basement membrane and may be related to the development of the inner ear  <cit> . these mutations in sa may cause its sensorineural deafness. there are no similar changes in sg and sr . reconstructions of the saccular otolith morphology using synchrotron x-ray microtomography among these three species show that the ventral surface of this otolith in sa is seriously aberrant, and the degree of corrosion has distinctly increased in the following order: sg < sr < sa . both the anatomy of the swim bladder  and the numbers of neuromasts and scales of the trunk lateral line system  also indicate these hearing-related organs in sa have different degrees of weakness. our data together indicated that the cave-restricted species sa might have reduced hearing, which could be similar with that demonstrated in amblyopsid cavefishes  <cit> . furthermore, a comparison of the distribution of neuromasts on the head  also suggested that the response to vibration of these three species was sg > sr > sa, which is different from the general pattern in astyanax  <cit> .fig.  <dig> 
i the distributions of superficial neuromasts on the head and ii morphology of saccular otolith in the inner ear among the three sinocyclocheilus species. the superficial neuromasts after daspei staining from the plates i-, i- and i- represent sg, sr and sa, respectively. the photos from left to right show the lateral view, dorsal view and ventral view. these figures show that the numbers of neuromasts in the adult fishes decline in the following order: sg > sr > sa. the morphology of the saccular otoliths was reconstructed based on synchrotron x-ray microtomography. the plates ii-, ii- and ii- represent sg, sr and sa, respectively. the photos from left to right show the location of saccular otoliths in the inner ear, the dorsal view and ventral view of its morphology. the ventral of saccular otolith in sa is seriously aberrant, with a deep and expanded central pit, encircled by another lateral sulcus. the degree of corrosion increase is in the following order: sg < sr < sa. scale bar: 1 mm



different immune responses to specific habitats
the immune activities of sa may be lower than its epigean counterparts because it probably lives in a less diverse microbial environment. the fact that sa is more susceptible to disease in captivity might support this inference . we found relatively fewer copies of immune genes in sa when compared with those in sg and sr . however, one important innate immune group, the tlr  gene family, showed some degree of expansion in sa , through the duplication of tlr <dig> and tlr <dig> in the sa genome. this suggests that these three species may have evolved differential immune activities for innate immunity and adaptive immunity according to their different habitats. interestingly, the semi-cave-dwelling sr had substantially more copy numbers of immune genes than sg and sa , which may be a result of an adaptation to heterogeneous elements between epigean and hypogean habitats, as found in the amphibious mudskippers  <cit> .

lack of diurnal rhythms
previous research reported that some cavefishes lack diurnal rhythms when living in perpetual darkness  <cit> . for example, cave populations of a. mexicanus have a phenotype of reduced sleep in comparison to their surface relatives  <cit> . we found that both the two copies of skp <dig> in sa had deletions in the n-terminal end of its protein . since skp <dig> is one of the components of the skp1-cul1-fbxl <dig>  protein complex, and the scf complex is most relevant in the mammalian clock mechanism  <cit> , the deletions in skp <dig> might lead to some dysfunction in scf, which suggests weaker light rhythms in sa. meanwhile, the transcriptomic analysis of the eye demonstrated that expression levels of the rhythm pathway genes decrease in the order sg > sr > sa .

low fecundity in sa
although low fecundity is often assumed to be normal in cave species  <cit> , there is little empirical evidence, and the different fecundity levels between surface and cave forms sometimes seem to be habitat plastic . we know of no study on the fecundity of the cave-dwelling sinocyclocheilus species. our analysis of the absolute fecundity  of sg and sa ) indicated that the fecundity in cave sinocyclocheilus species is much less than surface congeners. interestingly, one related gene, creb3l <dig>  was found to have been lost in the sa genome. it has been reported that creb3l <dig> can regulate the expression of genes required for germ cell survival, although it is insufficient to disrupt the normal fertility in mice  <cit> .

enhancement of taste
taste buds are enhanced in some cavefishes, such as astyanax  <cit> . we applied the taste-related gene sequences of zebrafish to blast to the three sinocyclocheilus genomes, and unexpectedly found that one taste receptor gene, the tast1r2- <dig>  was significantly expanded  and one important transcription factor, the prox <dig> gene, had threefold copies in these three species compared with zebrafish . however, if these expansions were correlated to the overall enhancement of taste in the three sinocyclocheilus species  we still need further testing. some taste receptor genes, such as tas1r <dig> and tas2r200- <dig>  were specifically duplicated in the sa genome  , which suggests a further improvement in the sense of taste in the cave-restricted sa. a preliminary study of the distribution of taste buds within the jaws of these three species also indicated that their numbers increase in a sequence from sg < sr < sa .

CONCLUSIONS
this paper focused on comparative genomic and transcriptomic studies of three sinocyclocheilus species, representative of surface-dwelling , semi-cave-dwelling  and cave-restricted  species. we found that speciation and population dynamics of these fishes are closely related to the uplifting stages of the qinghai-tibetan plateau. comparative genome analysis revealed many genetic changes, such as gene loss, pseudogenes, mutations and down-regulation, which were associated with regressive features , and some gene expansions suggest that constructive features  have evolved in caves . the most important genetic changes in the cave-restricted sa are summarized in fig.  <dig>  among them, some changes are similar to those in other cavefishes  from very different parts of the world , but some are not . although the incidence of gene losses and expansions in cave-restricted sa corresponds to the distinct phenotype variations, the changes seem to be fixed in its genome rather than in other mechanisms. the genetic changes found at the genome level in this study, although needing further functional confirmation, still give some good clues to understanding the mysteries of cave adaptation.fig.  <dig> summary of the most important genetic changes in the cave-restricted sa. the main results are outlined as follows: lws <dig>  rh2- <dig>  rh2- <dig> and rh2- <dig> are lost in sa. several crystallin genes, including crygmx in the sr and cryball <dig>  crygm2d <dig>  crygm <dig> and crygmx in sa, have evolved into pseudogenes. sa has two hsp90α genes while sg and sr have only one; meanwhile, the expression of hsp90α in sa eyes is higher than that in sg and sr. mpv <dig> has a deletion in the signal region in the sa genome. ush2a has two amino acid changes, i.e. r334s and v382a. tyr has a nucleotide mutation  in one copy of the sa genome. two copies of edar gene in sa represent deletions, and lamb <dig> and col7a were lost. two copies of skp <dig> protein in sa have deletions in the n-terminal end. prox <dig> and tast1r2- <dig> are under expansions in the three sinocyclocheilus species genomes, and tas1r <dig> and tas2r200- <dig> are specifically duplicated in the sa genome. red, gene loss; green, gene expansion; purple, pseudogene; orange, mutation or deletion



in the history of cave biology research, people have often been confused by the plethora of views and terms, such as disuse, preadaptation, opportunism, compensation, regressive evolution, etc. adaptations to cave living are complicated because there is no morphological ‘archetype’ for cave animals, and the characters show a highly diverse mix  <cit> . there is still a long way to go before this work can be applied to general evolutionary theory. as the first report on cavefish genomes among distinct species in sinocyclocheilus, our work provides not only insights into genetic mechanisms of cave adaptation, but is also a fundamental resource for better understanding of cavefish biology.
