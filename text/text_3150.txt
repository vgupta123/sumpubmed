BACKGROUND
one of the major costs of group-living is its inherent risk of pathogen infection for group members  <cit> . while solitary species can only use personal immune responses to fight against infections, group-living species also possess the unique capability of mounting collective immune defenses, a phenomenon called social immunity  <cit> . over the last two decades, a growing number of studies showed that multiple forms of social immunity can be expressed in species with permanent and obligatory social life, such as eusocial insects . these studies were of great interest for the development of research on social immunity in insects, because they demonstrated that the high risks of pathogen infection associated with obligatory and complex forms of social life were likely to select for the emergence of collective defenses against pathogens  <cit> . however, they were of limited relevance to understand whether social immunity only emerged in eusocial systems and therefore represents a secondary trait derived from eusociality, or whether it also occurs in less derived forms of group-living and thus possibly plays a central role in the early evolution of group living organisms  <cit> .

one method to address this issue is to investigate the occurrence of social immunity in species with temporary and facultative group-living. this is the case of species with family life, which represents a common form of group-living in insects  <cit> , can be temporary and facultative such as in precocial species  <cit>  and is generally considered as a major step in the evolutionary route to eusocial systems  <cit> . in insects, family life is broadly associated with the expression of care to the eggs and/or juveniles, such as protection against predators, clutch displacement and food provisioning  <cit> . family life may also include forms of social immunity before egg hatching. for instance, parents groom their eggs to prevent the development of fungal spores in the european earwig forficula auricularia  <cit> , apply bacteria with antifungal properties to brood cell prior to oviposition in the european beewolf philanthus triangulum  <cit> , coat their nest with antimicrobial secretions in the housefly musca domestica  <cit>  or prophylactically avoid nest sites with high microbial pressure in the burying beetle nicrophorus vespilloides  <cit> . although pre-hatching forms of social immunity have been well studied in insects, surprisingly little is known about the nature and occurrence of the post-hatching ones . only recent studies showed that parental anal exudates and larval secretions exhibit antimicrobial properties in the burying beetles  <cit> . in this species, however, larvae feed on the carcass serving as nesting habitat, so that these antimicrobial mechanisms could also reflect evolutionary responses to competition with microbes over food access and/or to the extraordinarily high microbial pressure in this specific habitat.

in this study, we investigated whether social immunity occurs in the form of the production of feces with antimicrobial activity in the european earwig f. auricularia, an insect with temporary and facultative family life. in this species, mothers provide care to their offspring in soil burrows for several months, during which all family members - once hatched - line ground and walls with their feces pellets  <cit> . earwig maternal care can take multiple forms, such as egg and juveniles  attendance and food provisioning through regurgitation, which have been shown to enhance offspring fitness  <cit> . nevertheless, nymph survival does not require maternal care, as nymphs are mobile at hatching and can forage for themselves  <cit> . here, we first tested whether  earwig feces provides a form of social immunity by inhibiting the development of bacteria and fungus into the nest, and determined whether these effects were independent of the consumed food and nesting material. we then investigated whether  antimicrobial activity was stronger in maternal compared to nymphal feces, as expected under the assumption that it reflects a post-hatching form of maternal care. finally, we tested whether  the antimicrobial activity of feces is a socially-mediated trait that is triggered or inhibited by experiencing mother-offspring interactions  <cit> . if antimicrobial properties are induced by mother-offspring interactions, we predict that the feces produced by isolated individuals show lower antimicrobial activities. conversely, we predict higher antimicrobial activities in feces produced by the isolated individuals if the costs of producing antimicrobial agents in the feces entail a mother-offspring conflict, in which each party tries to reduce its own investment into the production of antimicrobial components while benefiting from that of the other.

methods
insect rearing and feces collection
we collected feces pellets in 17 f. auricularia families composed of one mother and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   nymphs. these mothers were the first laboratory-born generation of individuals field sampled in  <dig> in dolcedo, italy, and then maintained under standard laboratory conditions . to determine whether the occurrence of mother-offspring interactions influences the antimicrobial properties of maternal and nymphal feces, the  <dig> families were randomly distributed among two groups at egg hatching. in the first group, we experimentally prevented mother-offspring interactions by separating mothers from their clutch of nymphs one day after egg hatching . by contrast, mothers in the second group were separated from their nymphs ten days after egg hatching . these separations were done by transferring the mother and the clutch of nymphs to two new petri dishes. at day  <dig>  mothers and groups of nymphs from family groups were separated and transferred into two new petri dishes, in which they were maintained until feces collection at day  <dig> . this manipulation was also done on the individuals from the isolation groups to standardize the experimental process. the transfer and three day delay between separation and feces collection ensured that the collected feces was relatively fresh and in large enough quantity to conduct the radial diffusion assays.

individuals received ad libitum standardized food  from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  and ad libitum green-colored pollen  from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  under these conditions, orphaning does not affect nymph quality in terms of developmental time and survival rate . the use of colored pollen is common in earwig experiments  and was used here to disentangle feces pellets from sand grains in the rearing containers. at day  <dig>  all  feces pellets present in each petri dish were collected using a sterile 10 μl pipette tip. for each petri dish, the total amount of collected pellets was weighed to the nearest  <dig>  μg , then suspended in 500 μl sterile nacl solution  and finally stored at 4°c. this feces solution was used  <dig>  ±  <dig>  days  later to conduct the radial diffusion assays . all petri dishes  contained humid sand as substrate and a plastic shelter as a nest. they were maintained in a climate chamber at 60% humidity, constant 20°c and 10:14 h light/dark cycle during the course of the experiment.

radial diffusion assays
we tested the antimicrobial properties of maternal and nymphal feces using a total of  <dig> radial diffusion assays against two gram+ bacteria, one gram- bacteria, and two fungi species . radial diffusion assays were conducted in petri dishes  filled with pda  covered with a solution of  <dig> bacteria or spores/ml. four samples were tested per plate. to this end, each fourth of a pda plate received a blank disc  in its center, on which 10 μl of feces solution was preliminary applied. the same process was used to conduct a total of  <dig> controls , in which we tested whether growth inhibition could result from the nacl solution used to dilute the feces , the food eaten by the tested individuals  or the sand on which feces has been released . after inoculation, each plate was incubated at 36°c/24 h for bacteria and at 20°c/48 h or 20°c/72 h for the fungus . at the end of the incubation, the zone of clearance  was measured three times per sample and then averaged to give one mean value called antimicrobial activity.

the radial diffusion assays were conducted against five microbial species covering a spectrum of groups that have the capability to grow into earwig burrows. first, we used staphylococcus aureus , which is a gram+ bacteria known to secrete a range of enzymes and toxins associated with several diseases in vertebrates and invertebrates  <cit> . second, bacillus subtilis  is another gram+ bacteria, which is a facultative pathogen commonly found in the soil  <cit> . third, escherichia coli  is a gram- bacteria typically found in the intestinal tracts of mammals and insects  <cit> . fourth, saccharomyces cerevisiae  is a fungus known to cause lethal infections in invertebrates  <cit> . finally, aspergillus niger  is a fungus growing on rotten plant material that can be an opportunistic pathogen  <cit> .

statistical analyses
we first tested the effect of feces producer , family life  and their interaction on the log-transformed amount of feces produced between day  <dig> and  <dig>  using a linear model. because inhibition zones do not follow normal distributions and include a substantial number of zeros across the radial diffusion assays , the significance of the effects of feces producer and family life on antimicrobial activity were then tested using a series of randomized analysis of variance . this non-parametric method allows estimating the significance of a factor  by running a series of 10’ <dig> anova, in which the response variable  is permuted across the explanatory factors . finally, we conducted pairwise comparisons between the antimicrobial activities of the controls  and the ones of the maternal or the nymphal feces using mann–whitney rank tests, in which the significance level α =  <dig>  was adjusted for multiple testing to α =  <dig>  using bonferonni correction. all statistical analyses were conducted using the software r v <dig> . <dig> . the r script to conduct randomized anova is available on demand.

RESULTS
each mother produced on average  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg  of feces between day  <dig> and day  <dig>  this quantity was smaller than the  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mg of feces produced by the clutch of nymphs during the same period of time  χ21 =  <dig> , p <  <dig> ). the total amount of feces produced over three days was independent of family isolation , or of an interaction between family isolation and feces producer .

inhibition zones were found in  <dig>  assays against b. subtilis,  <dig>  against s. aureus,  <dig>  against s. cerevisiae,  <dig>  against a. niger, but none  against e. coli. maternal feces inhibited the growth of at least one microbial species in  <dig>  of the  <dig> tested families, while nymphal feces had inhibition effects in every sample from the  <dig>  families. none of the controls  showed antimicrobial activity in any of the  <dig> assays .figure  <dig>

the antimicrobial activity of maternal and nymphal feces produced over three days depended on the feces producer and the microbial species, but not on the occurrence of mother-offspring interactions . specifically, antimicrobial activities against a. niger and s. cerevisae were lower in maternal compared to nymphal feces, whereas antimicrobial activities against b. subtilis and s. aureus were independent of feces producer . except against e. coli, each type of feces showed higher antimicrobial activity than the controls . the general antibacterial activity of nymphal feces against s. aureus was mostly driven by three points in the data set . if these three points were excluded, the resulting mean antibacterial activity of nymphal feces against s. aureus would become null and thus smaller than the one of maternal feces  and similar to the controls .table  <dig>

in line with the prediction that antifungal components are more concentrated in maternal than nymphal feces, we found that the antimicrobial activities per mg of feces against b. subtilis and s. aureus were larger in maternal compared to nymphal feces . by contrast, feces producer did not influence such activity against s. cerevisae . overall, the occurrence of mother-offspring interactions did not shape the antimicrobial activities per mg of feces against b. subtilis, s. aureus and s. cerevisae . however, it interacted with feces producer to shape the antimicrobial activity per mg of feces against a. niger . specifically, the presence of mother-offspring interactions canceled the antimicrobial activity of maternal feces  but had no effect on the one of nymphal feces . note that this interaction was only marginally non-significant when analyzing the overall antimicrobial activity of maternal feces produced over three days .figure  <dig>

discussion
gaining a better understanding of the evolution of the multiple forms of group-living requires insights into the mechanisms that help individuals to limit the inherent risk of infection. here, we demonstrate that lining nests with feces inhibits microbial development in the european earwig. specifically, earwig feces showed antimicrobial activities against two gram+ bacteria  and two fungi . these antimicrobial properties are likely to provide immune benefits to earwig family members, as many microbial entomopathogens have the capability to grow under the underground conditions provided by insect nests , several of them are known to frequently attack earwig nests  <cit> , and a recent study showed that even the development of non-entomopathogenic fungus into the nest comes with detrimental effects on earwig fitness  <cit> . together with the fact that earwig nymphs produce more feces when encountering related compared to unrelated conspecific juveniles  <cit> , these results thus support that feces production at least partly reflects a kin-triggered form of social immunity.

the maintenance of feces in the nest is a poorly studied phenomenon in eusocial insects  <cit> , in which colony members are generally assumed to evacuate feces into specific nest chambers to prevent microbial development in the colony . this phenomenon has nevertheless been reported in two non-eusocial insects exclusively feeding on their nesting material, the wood cockroach cryptocercus punctulatus and the burying beetle n. vespilloides  <cit> , for which the use of anal exudates  into the nest has been proposed to have at least partially evolved to limit competition with microbes over food access  <cit> .

our study shows that the total amount of feces produced by mothers over three days did not exhibit higher antimicrobial activities than the one produced by nymphs, revealing that feces antimicrobial activity is not a simple form of post-hatching maternal care. instead, we show that nymphs contributed more to antifungal nest protection than mothers, mostly due to their overall larger production of feces . this higher feces production also allowed nymphs to compensate for the lower intrinsic antibacterial activity of their feces  against gram+ bacteria, thus exhibiting an overall antimicrobial activity comparable to the one of maternal feces. this age-specific effect on the antimicrobial activity per mg of feces suggests differences in composition between nymphal and maternal feces. feces compositions could differ in terms of quantity and/or quality of residual compounds of their personal immunity, which are known to be present in the feces and to become stronger with aging in other insect species  <cit> . another discrepancy in feces composition could result from differing hindgut flora of mothers and nymphs. the insects gut includes a great variety of symbiotic microorganisms that are crucial for growth and protection against infections  <cit> , but that also change with aging  <cit> . finally, nymphal and maternal feces could vary in terms of chemical products released during defecation. for instance, earwigs possess a pygidial gland on their abdomen that releases chemicals with antimicrobial properties  <cit> . disentangling among these three non-mutually exclusive hypotheses will be addressed in further studies by investigating the presence of immune components and antimicrobial chemicals inside the feces, as well as by characterizing earwig gut flora.

we found that the antimicrobial activity of maternal feces depended on preliminary interactions with their nymphs. specifically, family interactions inhibited the antimicrobial activity of maternal feces against s. cerevisiae, whereas they had no effect on the one of nymphal feces. this latter result contrasts with the one found in the burying beetle n. vespilloides, in which the absence of tending parents lowered the level of antibacterial activity in larvae exudates  <cit> . in earwigs, our result first reveals that the presence and/or quantity of the compounds mediating the antimicrobial activity of maternal feces against s. cerevisiae are socially-dependent. more generally, it suggests that mothers can adapt their investment into such a form of social immunity to the investment expressed by their nymphs. assuming that investment into social immunity is energetically costly , such maternal strategy could be adaptive and allow mothers to re-allocate their energy into other important life-history traits, such as forms of care and future reproduction  <cit> . nevertheless, the effect of family life on feces antimicrobial activities was absent with the four other tested microbial species, indicating that the compounds mediating this activity are fixed during the period of family life. these compounds do not come from the environment, as there was no antimicrobial activity in the food consumed by the individuals and in the sand covering the rearing containers.

a somewhat surprising result of our study was the large number of feces samples with no antimicrobial activity. these negative assays are unlikely to reflect a problem in our methodology, as radial diffusion assay is a standard procedure that has been commonly used to test antimicrobial activities in other insect species . they are also unlikely to reflect that feces antimicrobial activity is a family-trait only expressed in a limited number of families, since we showed that the occurrence  of feces antimicrobial activities was not necessarily the same between nymphs and mothers from the same family. conversely, our result could reflect a form of specificity in the immune responses mediated by the feces, which is in line with the fact that almost every feces sample inhibited the growth of at least one of the tested microbes. another explanation could be that feces producers need some cues to switch on antimicrobial activity in their feces. these cues are unlikely to come from our standardized rearing environment, but might reflect that some field sampled mothers have been naturally exposed to pathogens prior sampling, and that such exposure affected the immunity of their own descendants through transgenerational immune priming  <cit> . however, the occurrence of transgenerational immune priming remains to be tested in f. auricularia.

although earwig feces showed antimicrobial activity against the two tested gram+ bacteria, this activity was absent against the gram- bacteria e. coli. this lack of activity against e. coli has been reported in the antimicrobial secretions of other insect, such as the burying beetle n. vespilloides  <cit> . it may reflect either  higher physiological costs of mounting antimicrobial protection against gram- bacteria  <cit> ,  low selection pressure to mount defenses against gram- bacteria, e.g. because they are not present in their natural habitat or are important symbiotic organisms in the gut flora , or  specific resistance of the tested bacterial strain against the antimicrobial compounds present in earwig feces. further studies should address this issue.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, we demonstrate that social immunity in the form of lining nest with antimicrobial compounds can emerge and persist in species with primitive forms of group-living. mounting collective defenses against microbial development could therefore be a widespread phenomenon across social systems and an important one in the early evolution of social life, as it does not require that individuals live in permanent and obligatory groups, and/or that group members compete with microbes for access to nest material as a food source. interestingly, these results also emphasize that defecation does not only reflect individual needs of waste disposal, but can be under selection for its importance in other crucial life-history traits  <cit> .
