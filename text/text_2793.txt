BACKGROUND
the tracheobronchial tree, a dichotomous branching structure that begins at the larynx and ends after  <dig> branches at the alveoli, is lined by an epithelium comprised of  <dig> major cell types, including ciliated, secretory, undifferentiated columnar and basal cells  <cit> . the airway epithelium is exposed directly to environmental xenobiotics, particulates, pathogens and other toxic substances suspended in inhaled air  <cit> . of these, chronic cigarette smoking, with its  <dig> xenobiotics and >  <dig> oxidants per puff, is a major cause of airway disease, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and bronchogenic carcinoma  <cit> . it is the airway epithelium that exhibits the first abnormalities relevant to copd and lung cancer, and it is the small airway epithelium  that is the primary site of the early manifestations of the majority of smoking-induced lung disease  <cit> . as compared to proximal airways, the small airway epithelium has unique morphologic features with a decrease in the frequency of basal cells and mucus-secreting cells accompanied by increased numbers of clara cells, a secretory cell subtype critical for the maintenance of the structural and functional integrity at the airway-alveoli interface  <cit> .

our group  <cit>  and others  <cit>  have carried out several studies using gene expression microarrays to assess the transcriptome of the human airway epithelium, demonstrating that smoking modulates the expression of hundreds of genes. the advent of rna-seq technology, in which the entire polyadenylated transcriptome is sequenced  <cit> , is capable of building on this microarray data to provide additional insights into the transcriptome of the airway epithelium and its response to cigarette smoke. because rna-seq provides direct sequencing information of all polyadenylated mrnas and is not limited by probe design, rna-seq data has inherently less noise and higher specificity, and, importantly, provides quantitative information on mrna transcript number  <cit> . with high sensitivity and low background, rna-seq has a dynamic range of >  <dig> -fold, is highly reproducible, yields digital information not requiring normalization, and can distinguish individual members of highly homologous gene families  <cit> . in the context of this background, the focus of this study is to utilize massive parallel sequencing to quantify the complete transcriptome of the human sae in healthy nonsmokers and healthy smokers.

RESULTS
study population and sae sampling
sae samples from  <dig> healthy nonsmokers and  <dig> healthy smokers were analyzed using mrna-seq . all individuals had no significant prior medical history and a normal physical examination. to minimize the influence of potential confounding variables, only males of african-american ancestry were assessed. the nonsmokers were younger . there were no differences be-tween the two groups with respect to pulmonary function criteria . the smoking status was confirmed by urinary tobacco metabolites . the number of cells recovered ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  ×  <dig>  with > 97% epithelial cells in all cases . there was no difference between the two groups with respect to the proportions of each of the four major cell types, with the exception of ciliated cells, which were significantly lower in the healthy smokers compared to the healthy nonsmokers .

data processing and quality control
the cdna generated from sae samples was run in a single lane per subject on illumina flow cells. a total of  <dig> million,  <dig> base pair single end reads were generated, yielding  <dig>  gigabases of sequence. these sequences were aligned using bowtie version  <dig>  . to correct for transcript length and depth of coverage, raw reads were converted into reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads   <cit> . rpkm was then assessed across the entirety of reads with reference to exons, introns and intergenic regions. a comparison was made between the expression levels of exons and intergenic regions to define a threshold value above which there was the highest confidence in the validity of the expression value . this was performed by generating a false discovery rate for a range of expression values across all subjects, resulting in the adoption of a cut-off value of  <dig>  rpkm, representing an optimal compromise between false positive and false negative values . all subsequent analyses were based on the application of this expression threshold.

of the  <dig>  annotated genes in the human genome version  <dig> reference  <cit> ,  <dig>   were expressed in sae at greater than the rpkm cut-off value of  <dig> . the average expression level was  <dig>  rpkm  and the average among subject coefficient of variation in rkpm was  <dig> . this cut off may be conservative due to overestimation of the number of intronic and intergenic reads. based on a survey of a random intergenic domain on the genome, we estimate that ~50% of the reads mapped to intergenic and intronic regions correspond to repetitive elements. these probably represent mismapping of reads that properly belong polyadenylated mrnas that contain the same repetitive elements. if the impact was to drop the threshold from  <dig> , as used here, to  <dig> , the number of expressed genes would increase from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . it is estimated that  <dig> rpkm corresponds to one mrna per cell. as a result, we believe there is little significant biology lost by using a conservative cut off  of  <dig>   vs a more stringent cut off of  <dig>  .

a subset of  <dig> genes with rpkm differing by >  <dig> logs was confirmed by taqman realtime quantitative pcr with relative quantitation, using rrna for normalization. the overall correlation between expression levels determined by these  <dig> methods was very strong  .

comparison of sae gene expression to other tissue transcriptomes
rna-seq allows absolute quantitation of mrna levels and for the fractional contribution of individual transcripts to the total mrna population to be assessed  <cit> . in some tissues, transcripts from a relatively small number of genes account for much of the total cellular poly+ rna pool . in the case of liver, the single most highly expressed gene contributes 10% of the total mrna molecules and the top ten collectively contribute 37%  <cit> . in colon, by contrast, the single top mrna contributes only 2% of the total mrna and the top ten contribute 9% <cit> . of the total sae transcripts identified in healthy nonsmokers, 13% mapped to the scgb1a <dig> gene . the top  <dig> genes contributed 24% of the total mrna .

 <dig> listed are the top  <dig> most highly expressed sae enriched genes.

ubiquitous and sae-enriched genes
to categorize the sae-expressed genes in healthy nonsmokers as ubiquitous  or genes expressed in an sae-enriched fashion, a comparison was made between the  <dig>  genes identified by ramsköld et al  <cit>  to be ubiquitously expressed in various human tissues and the  <dig>  genes expressed in human sae. the data showed that  <dig>   of the genes identified by ramsköld et al  <cit>  as ubiquitously expressed genes were also expressed by human sae, indicating that 48% of the sae transcriptome is comprised of ubiquitously expressed genes. the remaining 52% were designated as "sae-enriched" genes.

the most highly expressed sae-enriched gene  was scgb1a <dig>  which is expressed primarily by clara cells located in small airways  <cit> . rna-seq fragments mapped to all three exons of the scgb1a <dig> gene at very high density . other highly expressed sae-enriched genes included secretoglobin, family 3a, member  <dig>  secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor , chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> , tubulin polymerization-promoting protein family member  <dig>  and cd <dig> 

to further characterize the sae transcriptome, gene expression levels derived from rna-seq data were divided into three groups. "low" expression was assigned as significantly expressed . "medium" expression was defined at between  <dig> and  <dig> rpkm and "high" expression was defined as >  <dig> rpkm . analyses of the frequency distribution of ubiquitous and sae-enriched refseq-annotated genes revealed that considerably more of the sae-enriched gene set were expressed at lower levels  compared to the ubiquitous genes .

prior to the advent of rna-seq method, information about the transcriptome of airway epithelium was derived from gene expression microarrays  <cit> . to assess the concordance of expression pattern by rna-seq and microarrays, all genes expressed by rna-seq were evaluated as to whether they were identified as expressed in all microarrays, a subset of microarrays or not represented on the microarray . for ubiquitous genes, the percentage of genes identified by rna-seq also identified as expressed in > 50% of subjects by microarray was greater for highly expressed genes  than medium expressed genes . only  <dig> % of ubiquitous genes with low expression identified by rna-seq were scored as expressed by microarray . similarly, for the sae-enriched genes, the percent of genes identified by rna-seq and in > 50% of subjects by microarray was greater for highly expressed genes , compared to medium expressed genes , and even more so for genes with low expression . thus, overall, the two methods are broadly in agreement, but rna-seq provides more information, not only quantitative data, but also identification of expression of genes with low expression levels.

functional assessment of ubiquitous and sae-enriched genes
to better understand biologic functions enriched in the sae transcriptome, the gene lists were assigned to functional categories using gene ontology molecular functions and the expression levels for ubiquitous and sae-enriched genes were compared . in some functional categories such as signal transduction, the allotment of genes to the sae-enriched and ubiquitous categories, as well as the distribution of expression levels within those categories, was similar to that for all genes . but several deviations from the expected distribution were observed. for example, for the functional category "translation", many more genes were classified as ubiquitous compared to sae-enriched and those that were sae-enriched were expressed at higher levels than expected based on all genes. by contrast, in the category "immunity", the number of genes in the sae-enriched category was higher than expected but distribution of expression level was in line with the average expression of all genes. the median expression levels among the various categories allowed quantification of these differences. the median expression levels for the sae-enriched genes were lower than that for the ubiquitous genes in all categories. for example, for the ubiquitous genes, the median levels ranged from  <dig>  rpkm for membrane receptors to  <dig>  rpkm for translation, whereas, for the sae-enriched genes, the median levels ranged from  <dig>  for membrane receptors to  <dig>  rpkm for translation. on the average, the most highly expressed category was "translation, ubiquitous" genes , whereas the lowest was "membrane receptors, sae-enriched" .

the human sae is made up of  <dig> major cell types including ciliated cells , undifferentiated columnar cells , basal cells  and secretory cells . the sae also has rare neuroendocrine cells   <cit> . the availability of cell type-specific gene lists, together with the ability of rna-seq to quantify mrna abundance, allows the contributions of these cell types to the sae transcriptome to be assessed quantitatively. when compared to all genes of the sae-enriched transcriptome, genes encoding cilia components were expressed at much higher levels and genes encoding neuroendocrine cell genes were expressed at much lower levels . on the other hand, genes identified as representative of the basal cells and secretory cells were expressed at levels comparable with the average level for sae-enriched genes. the highest expressed cilia-related genes included tubulin β2c and α1a subunits, tektin and a number of dynein subunits with rpkm of >  <dig> . by contrast, neuroendocrine genes such as secreogranin ii  and chromogranin a  were expressed at <  <dig> rpkm with the exception of enolase  <dig>  which may not be neuroendocrine cell-specific  <cit> . among the mucus-secreting cell genes, trefoil factor  <dig> and two mucin genes, muc <dig> and muc5b, were the most highly expressed . for the basal cell genes, when assessed in the context of all sae genes, malat <dig> , cst <dig> cystatin c  and pfn <dig> profilin  <dig>  were the most highly expressed.

 <dig> list includes genes known to be enriched in expression in ciliated cells   <cit> , secretory cells , basal cells   <cit> , and neuroendocrine cells   <cit> . the small airway epithelium expression level was determined and the top  <dig> highly expressed  were tabulated in descending order of expression level.

to obtain insight into transcriptional regulation of the sae of nonsmokers, the sae-enriched transcriptome was surveyed for the most highly expressed transcription factors in various structural categories . among the top  <dig> most highly expressed, the helix-turn-helix dominated, with the basic helix-loop-helix and β-scaffold categories next. interestingly, the top  <dig> most highly expressed sae-enriched transcription factors all have previously been established as having a role in airway biology and/or lung cancer, including foxj <dig>  elf <dig>  trim <dig>  sox <dig>  and foxa <dig>  <cit> . rna-seq analysis also revealed high expression levels for a variety of pathway-specific transcription factors, including two  related to notch signaling.

 <dig> the top  <dig> dna-binding transcription factors were identified in the highly expressed sae-enriched list for n =  <dig> healthy nonsmokers. they were categorized by transcription factor family and sorted in descending order of expression within each category.

to quantify the expression of the receptors and ligands that may be involved in epithelial maintenance, the most highly expressed transmembrane receptors in different structural categories were identified . discoidin domain receptor tyrosine kinase  <dig> , a collagen receptor associated with poor prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer, was the most highly expressed transmembrane receptor  <cit> . there were a significant number of g protein coupled,  <dig> transmembrane receptors in the highly expressed category, including a homophilic cadherin-coupled receptor  and the complement 5a receptors, as well as  <dig> orphan receptors . in addition to ddr <dig>  there were also a number of highly expressed tyrosine kinase receptors among the top  <dig>  including fibroblast growth factor receptors  and the insulin like growth factor  <dig> receptor . interestingly, the receptors for oxytocin and natriuretic peptide were also expressed at a high level.

 <dig> the top  <dig> transmembrane receptors were identified in the highly expressed sae-enriched list for n =  <dig> healthy nonsmokers. they were categorized by structural family and sorted in descending order of expres-sion within each category.

with respect to ligands and growth factors, the most highly expressed included multiple chemokines mdk, cxcl <dig>  cx3cl <dig> and cxcl <dig> . no known ligand of the top  <dig> most highly expressed receptors was expressed at rpkm >  <dig> in the sae-enriched transcriptome, nor was any known receptor for the top  <dig> highly expressed ligands expressed in the sae-enriched transcriptome at rpkm >  <dig>  this observation is of interest, as it suggests that much of the biology of the sae relates to interactions of the sae as target  or source  of external stimuli modulating sae function or vice versa.

gene families
one advantage of rna-seq compared to microarray is that transcripts can be unequivocally mapped to a single member of a gene family when sequence is similar but not identical. thus, rna-seq can be used to identify and quantify highly homologous genes, something not possible with hybridization-based microarrays  <cit> . to quantify sae expression of homologous gene families in healthy nonsmokers, we identified all gene pairs with ≥ 90% sequence identity and assessed expression level by rna-seq in healthy nonsmokers. for example, in the cluster on chromosome  <dig> containing cyp2a <dig>  cyp2a <dig> and cyp2a <dig> , it was possible to map the reads to the different genes and show that expression of cyp2a <dig>  > cyp2a <dig>  > cyp2a <dig> . in the gsta cluster on chromosome  <dig> , a clear assignment of reads permitted the expression order of gsta <dig>  > gsta <dig>  > gsta <dig>  > gsta <dig> . as another example, in the metallothionein gene cluster on chromosome  <dig> , it was evident that expression level for mt1e  > mt1ll  > mt1m . among the other highly expressed homologous gene families in the sae were the α and β tubulins, annexins, glutathione s-transferase mu family, cytosolic phenol-preferring sulfotransferase family, α amylase, and nodal modulator . in all cases, the rna-seq allows the individual transcripts to be definitively distributed among family members.

effect of smoking on the sae transcriptome
the preceding analyses of sae-specific and ubiquitous transcripts are based exclusively on the rna-seq data from n =  <dig> nonsmokers. rna-seq data was also collected for n =  <dig> healthy smokers, who had a mean smoking history of  <dig> pack-yr . extensive transcription data based on the microarray methods has shown that smoking makes a substantial impact on gene expression in airway epithelium  <cit> . quantitative comparison by rna-seq of sae gene expression of healthy smokers vs healthy nonsmokers showed there was no gross effect of smoking on the overall distribution of the sae transcriptome in nonsmokers and smokers . however, there were changes in expression of individual genes with smoking, constituting  <dig> to 13% of the ubiquitous genes and  <dig> to 14% of the sae-enriched genes . in both categories, smoking responsiveness was slightly more noticeable in genes with medium and high expression than in genes with low expression.

to assess the quantitative effects of smoking, a modified volcano plot was devised in which the absolute change was plotted as a function of p value . the data show that, for both the ubiquitous and for the sae-enriched transcriptome, the number of genes down-regulated by smoking was substantially higher than that number of genes up-regulated by smoking. this was particularly noticeable among the ubiquitous genes.

because of the extensive microarray data on the response of airway epithelium to smoking, we sought to validate the rna-seq data by comparing the response to smoking as measured by the two different methods. micorarray data from a cohort of  <dig> healthy smokers and  <dig> non-smokers were used to generate a list of  <dig> genes represented by  <dig> probesets that were smoking-responsive  according to microarray. the fold-change by microarray was plotted against the fold change by rna-seq with an overall very strong correlation . there were no genes for which the direction of regulation by smoking differed between microarray and rna-seq method. therefore, rna-seq comprehensively captures the effect of smoking as determined by microarray method, thereby validating both approaches. the ability of the microarray method to capture the smoking-dependent gene expression detected by rna-seq was then assessed. rna-seq method using n =  <dig> nonsmokers and n =  <dig> smokers captured  <dig> smoking-dependent genes . for these genes, the impact of smoking as determined by microarray was generally similar . while rna-seq faithfully captures the effects of smoking as determined by microarray, the microarray method is less discriminating in capturing the smoking-dependent expression determined by rna-seq, consistent with the higher sensitivity of the latter method.

to assign function to smoking dependent genes, gene ontology searches of the biological process term were used to classify the expression of the smoking-suppressed and smoking-repressed genes . this analysis also showed that, in almost all categories, the expression of more genes was suppressed than induced. of interest, a comparison of function in the ubiquitous and sae-enriched categories pointed to some contrasts of potential significance. for example, among genes involved in transport, there were more smoking-induced sae-enriched genes than ubiquitous genes and also a higher proportion of smoking-inducible genes in the sae-enriched group compared to ubiquitous category. similarly, among proteases and anti-proteases, there was some smoking-inducibility in the sae-enriched genes, but none for ubiquitous genes.

in contrast to microarray data that suggests that cytochrome p <dig> genes and oxidant-related genes are those most highly induced by smoking  <cit> , quantitative rna-seq analysis demonstrated the largest up-regulation of a gene by smoking was β-microseminoprotein  and chromosome  <dig> open reading frame  <dig> . the most smoking-repressed genes were scgb1a <dig> and scgb3a <dig>  which were also the two most highly expressed sae genes in nonsmokers. the smoking-induced down-regulation of scgb1a <dig> gene expression was dramatic, with an absolute decrease in median rpkm from  <dig>   to  <dig>  .

 <dig> the top  <dig> genes were identified in four categories of genes most affected by smoking; largest absolute increase, largest absolute decrease, novel genes up-regulated by smoking and low level expressed genes suppressed by smoking. they were sorted in descending order of absolute difference in expression within each category and identified as being from the ubiquitous or small airway epithelium-enriched groups.

 <dig> benjamini-hochberg corrected p value. where the gene is not represented on the microarray or the affymetrix present call "p" is less than 25% of subjects, it is so indicated.

to detect novel smoking-dependent genes, we exploited the ability of rna-seq to quantify expression of genes with low expression. among the novel smoking-inducible and smoking-suppressed genes with low level expression were the smoking-inducible genes that had been previously identified by microarray   <cit> , but also newly identified smoking-induced genes, such as the oxido-reductase akr1b <dig> and transcription factor tprxl . similarly, new smoking-repressed genes were identified, including transcription factor pax <dig> and azu <dig>  an inflammatory mediator  <cit> .

based on the number of sae-enriched, smoking-dependent transport genes , we examined the expression of ion transport genes with low overall expression . the significance of this gene group is evident in the fact that polymorphisms in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator  gene, a chloride transporter, result in cystic fibrosis, a lethal hereditary disorder with a dramatic pulmonary phenotype  <cit> . cftr expression levels were in the range of  <dig> to  <dig> rpkm corresponding to an average of ~ <dig> to  <dig> mrna molecules per cell, a similar value to that estimated by polymerase chain reaction methodology  <cit> . there was no difference in cftr expression level between nonsmokers and smokers . in contrast, there were smoking-inducible transporters including the cftr related atp-binding cassette, sub-family c, member  <dig> , l-type calcium channel, voltage-dependent, gamma subunit  <dig> , and cyclic nucleotide gated channel, beta  <dig> . there were also significantly smoking-suppressed ion transporters, including solute carrier family  <dig>  member  <dig>  and potassium voltage-gated channel, shaw-related subfamily, member  <dig>  detected .

effect of smoking on alternative splicing
among the advantages of rna-seq is the ability to easily quantify different isoforms of one gene generated by alternate splicing. the frequencies of reads that span one or more splice junction were used to assess the relative levels of different isoforms separately in smokers and nonsmokers. interestingly, comparison of the splicing events between nonsmokers and smokers to the expected distribution revealed no divergence . this was true for both the ubiquitous and sae-enriched genes, suggesting there are no major smoking-dependent differences in splicing patterns.

discussion
the small airway epithelium, the cell population lining the bronchial tree ≥  <dig> generations, plays a central role in normal lung function and in the pathogenesis of many lung disorders  <cit> . among the most common sae-associated diseases are those caused by cigarette smoking, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  and lung adenocarcinoma. the development of massive parallel rna sequencing  technology permits quantitative assessment of poly+ mrna levels to a high degree of sensitivity  <cit> . compared to hybridization-based methodologies of transcriptome analysis, rna-seq has low background, broad dynamic range and high specificity  <cit> . using this approach, we have built upon the body of microarray-generated data to provide quantitative characterization of the transcriptome of the normal healthy human sae and characterize how it changes with smoking  <cit> . by comparing the sae rna-seq data to that of other tissues and organs, the present study grouped the sae transcriptome into  <dig> categories:  ubiquitous genes, i.e., sae genes shared with other organs and tissues, and  sae-enriched genes, i.e., those expressed by the sae, but not in the majority of other organs and tissues. using this classification, and based on the capacity of rna-seq to provide quantification of mrna, we further characterized the effect of smoking on the sae transcriptome.

sae-enriched transcripts
comparison of the expression profile of different tissues by rna-seq and serial analysis of gene expression  allows the identification of ubiquitous and tissue specific genes  <cit> . by comparing to the rna-seq data obtained for other organs and tissues, we found that among  <dig>  genes expressed in the sae, 52% of genes are enriched in the sae in a relatively selective manner and 48% of genes are ubiquitous. interestingly, the sae transcriptome includes more tissue-characteristic rnas than other epithelial  and non-epithelial  tissues, where ubiquitous genes contribute to  <dig> to 85% of the transcriptome  <cit> . this may reflect the high purity of the epithelial cells obtained by bronchial brushing . notably, sae genes with low expression levels contributed to 36% of the sae-enriched and only 2% of ubiquitous genes, indicating that molecular uniqueness of the sae is determined to a considerable degree by the transcripts with a low abundance. from the functional perspective, ubiquitous sae genes dominated in the categories related to housekeeping biologic processes such as translation and transcription, whereas sae-enriched genes were prevalent in more specific categories such as immunity, signal transduction, adhesion, and ion transport.

sae transcriptome specialization
specialized biological properties of a given organ or tissue are determined by a unique pattern of genes expressed in distinct cell populations typical for each tissue. the human sae is composed of various cell types, including ciliated, secretory , basal, undifferentiated columnar, and rare neuroendocrine cells  <cit> . although most of the sae-enriched genes are represented by low expressed transcripts, the top  <dig> highly expressed sae-enriched genes accounted for about 20% of the total sae mrna, suggesting that a limited number of genes may dictate the specific pattern of biological processes dominating in the sae under steady-state conditions. detailed analysis of the most highly expressed sae-enriched genes revealed a unique pattern of epithelial differentiation and molecular functions.

secretory differentiation
genes related to secretory epithelial differentiation dominated the most highly expressed sae-enriched genes. of the total sae transcripts identified, 13% mapped to the secretoglobin scgb1a <dig>  the high level of expression of scgb1a <dig> is expected in the sae, where clara cells are enriched and play an important role in the pulmonary host defense  <cit> . scgb1a <dig>  is involved in regulation of critical processes in the distal airways such as protection against oxidative stress, maintenance of the normal airway lining fluid homeostasis, regulation of inflammation and airway reactivity during respiratory infection, and control of macrophage activation in the lung  <cit> . another secretoglobin, scgb3a <dig>  originally called hin- <dig>  was the second-highest expressed sae-enriched gene. previous studies have identified the lungs as major site of scgb3a <dig> in humans  <cit> . expression of scgb3a <dig> is induced during epithelial differentiation and restricted to terminally differentiated airway epithelial cells and down-regulated in cancer  <cit> . there is evidence that scgb3a <dig> is also produced by clara cells  <cit>  and exerts growth-inhibitory activities  <cit> . consistent with its putative tumor-suppressor function, scgb3a <dig>  is aberrantly methylated in various types of cancer, including lung carcinomas  <cit> . based on previous observations, the quantitative data in the present study suggests that scgb3a <dig> could be a major steady-state tumor-suppressor gene in the human sae.

high expression of clara cell-associated secretoglobin genes in the sae was accompanied with enrichment of transcription factors forkhead box a <dig> , nk <dig> homeobox  <dig> , foxa <dig>  and ccaat/enhancer binding protein, alpha , transcription factors that constitute a major regulatory network for the development and maintenance of sae and clara cell differentiation  <cit> . nkx2- <dig> interacts with foxa <dig>  <cit> , foxa <dig> and foxa <dig> complement each other  <cit> , and both nkx2- <dig> and foxa <dig> are thought to act upstream of c/ebpα in lung epithelial differentiation  <cit> . a number of secretory genes, not previously described for the human sae, were identified by rna-seq as highly abundant sae-enriched genes, including tetraspanin- <dig> , a protein involved in secretory pathways in glandular cells  <cit> , cytochrome cyp4b <dig>  a cyp family member localized within the secretory granules of the respiratory mucosa  <cit> , and microseminoprotein-beta , an androgen-responsive secretory protein regulating cell growth and apoptosis  <cit> .

mucosal host defense
secretory leukocyte peptidase inhibitor  and polymeric immunoglobulin receptor , two key components of the mucosal defense system, were among the most highly expressed sae-enriched genes. slpi has multiple contributions to pulmonary defense, including its ability to neutralize neutrophil elastase, one of the major mediators of lung derangement associated with inflammatory diseases, direct antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities, and augmentation of anti-oxidant resistance by increasing glutathione levels in the respiratory surface fluid  <cit> . pigr is essential for the transepithelial basal-to-apical transport of the polymeric immunoglobulin iga to the epithelial surface, where it functions to sample and neutralize luminal pathogens  <cit> . lipocalin  <dig> , a siderophore-binding antimicrobial protein secreted by pulmonary epithelial cells  <cit> , and the whey acid protein four-disulfide core domain  <dig> , a slpi-related gene with potential innate immune functions  <cit> , were also among the most abundant genes enriched in the sae. among the most highly expressed genes in the sae was elf <dig>  a helix-loop-helix transcription factor expressed in diverse epithelial tissues implicated in the regulation of inflammatory responses  <cit> . in the context that the airway epithelium is at the interface of the environment  and potential inflammatory/immune mediators , the host defense genes identified in the present study as the most abundant sae genes may play a central role in both mediating and controlling the responses of the airway to environmental xenobiotics and pathogens.

anti-oxidant protection
the ability to resist deleterious effects of the oxidative stress is critical for the sae, continuously interacting with oxidants present in the inhaled air. apart from the secretory genes with anti-oxidant functions such as scgb1a <dig> and slpi, a number of other genes directly related to the protection from oxidative stress, including glutathione s-transferases pi  <dig> and alpha  <dig>  and glutathione peroxidase  <dig> , were identified as highly expressed sae-enriched genes. one of these components, gpx <dig>  also known as clara cell-specific protein cc <dig>  is selectively expressed by clara cells  <cit> , suggesting that high abundance of both secretory and oxidative stress-related features in the sae might reflect a secretory cell origin of at least some of the anti-oxidant mechanisms in the human sae.

mucociliary differentiation
consistent with the abundance of ciliated cells in the human sae, transcription factor foxj <dig>  the major regulator of ciliogenesis and ciliated cell differentiation in the airway epithelium  <cit> , was among the top  <dig> sae-enriched genes and the most highly expressed transcription factor. other cilia-related genes enriched in the sae were tektin- <dig> and - <dig>  structural determinants of the basal bodies of cilia  <cit> , cilia apical structure protein sentan  <cit> , dynein chains dnai <dig>  dnali <dig>  dnai <dig> and sperm associated antigen spag <dig>  the classic components of motile cilia  <cit> . in addition to these well-known genes, rna-seq analysis revealed that several recently discovered cilia-related genes were highly enriched in the human sae, including the member of the membrane-spanning 4-domain family ms4a8b, which has high sequence homology to cilia-associated gene l985p  <cit> .

surprisingly, a considerable number of mucus-related genes, such as trefoil factor  <dig>  <cit> , mucin  <dig> and mucin 5b  <cit> , were highly expressed in the sae transcriptome along with agr <dig>  a secretory factor related to goblet cell differentiation  <cit> . of note, as compared to the large airways, where secreted polymeric mucins are abundant  <cit> , the sae transcriptome was enriched in membrane-tethered mucins such as muc <dig>  muc <dig>  muc <dig>  muc <dig>  muc <dig>  and muc <dig>  which have various signaling functions  <cit> .

stem/progenitor cell features
although clara cells are considered to be stem/progenitor cells of the mouse bronchiolar epithelium  <cit> , the identity of stem/progenitor cell population of the sae in humans is unknown. several genes related to stem/progenitor cells were identified in the present study as sae-enriched genes, including aquaporin- <dig>  a marker of basal cell and suprabasal cell populations with progenitor cell function described for the human tracheobronchial epithelium  <cit>  and aldehyde dehydrogenase aldh <dig>  a marker of normal and malignant stem cells in various tissues  <cit> . it is notable that among the top  <dig> highly-expressed sae-enriched transcription factors were elf <dig>  which promotes epithelial morphogenesis  <cit> , and embryonic stem cell-related gene sox <dig>  recently shown to be important for the progenitor cell function of the airway basal cells and clara cells and induction of the airway epithelial cell phenotype in mice  <cit> . due to its high sensitivity, rna-seq analysis also identified markers of the putative stem/progenitor cells previously found in the airway epithelium with relatively low frequency, such as keratin  <dig>  a marker of a basal cell subpopulation  <cit> , and surfactant protein c, a gene ascribed to a unique population of bronchoalveolar stem cells in mice  <cit> . together, the rna-seq data of the present study demonstrates sae expression of multiple pathways potentially relevant for the maintenance of hu-man sae via local stem/progenitor cell activity.

the most highly expressed transmembrane receptor in sae of nonsmokers was ddr <dig> , a receptor tyrosine kinase  <cit> . expression of the ddr <dig> protein is located on the basolateral surface of human bronchial epithelium, where it interacts with type iv collagen with consequent activation of its tyrosine kinase activity. the second most abundant sae-enriched receptor was celsr <dig> , a g protein coupled receptor known to be critical for branching morphogenesis in mouse lung  <cit> . the most highly expressed sae-enriched ligand was midkine , which has a role in lung morphogenesis and is believed to be essential for vascular maintenance in the adult lung  <cit> . in mouse, midkine expression is controlled by nkx2- <dig>  <cit>  which, as mentioned above, is also highly expressed in the human sae. among the highly expressed ligands, there was a clear prevalence of chemokines such as mdk, cxcl <dig> and cx3cl <dig>  consistent with this observation, expression of diverse cytokines by airway epithelium and cell lines derived from airway epithelium is well established and epithelial derived chemokines are recognized to play an important role in attracting immune and inflammatory cells  <cit> .

the rna-seq data also pointed to potentially novel aspects of cell signaling in epithelial biology. for example, the oxytocin receptor  was expressed at high levels in all subjects who were male. this was initially surprising due to roles of oxytocin in childbirth, lactation and brain biology  <cit>  but, relevant to the airway epithelium, a role for oxytocin in autocrine signaling in small cell lung cancer has been described  <cit> .

gene family members
rna-seq offers the potential advantage of distinguishing expression levels among different members of closely related gene families with potentially different functions, whereas cross hybridization among probes often makes this a challenge using microarrays  <cit> . for example, the rna-seq analysis permitted quantification of the expression levels of  <dig> highly different homologous members of the cytochrome p <dig> family  <dig>  subfamily a, cyp2a <dig>  cyp2a <dig> and cyp2a <dig>  rna-seq allowed the transcripts to be unambiguously attributed primarily to cyp2a <dig> which is responsible for metabolism of the cigarette smoke specific carcinogen 4--1--1-butanone  <cit> . on the other hand, the family member cyp2a <dig> has different substrate specificity dictated by critical amino acid differences between these otherwise closely related proteins  <cit> . the significance of these differences are underscored by the variant cyp2a13* <dig>  which is associated with decreased incidences of lung adenocarcinoma in smokers  <cit> .

sae transcriptome response to smoking
extensive microarray studies have identified a dramatic effect of smoking on the gene expression profile of human airway epithelium  <cit> . by using rpkm quantification as a measure of smoking-dependent changes in sae transcript levels, the present study expands the insights into the airway epithelial response to smoking. the quantitative rna-seq analysis revealed that smoking suppressed the expression level of a greater number of genes than it induced. interestingly, among the up-regulated genes, smoking has a larger effect on sae-enriched genes rather than the ubiquitous genes. from the functional perspective, the sae-enriched smoking-up-regulated genes were related to transcription, signal transduction, protease/antiprotease homeostasis, and immunity.

the top  <dig> sae-enriched genes, the clara cell associated genes scgb1a <dig> and scgb3a <dig>  were both down-regulated by smoking with a large magnitude of change in expression levels. smoking and especially copd have been associated with the loss of clara cells and the levels of scgb1a <dig> in both induced sputum and serum are lower in smokers with copd as compared to both nonsmokers and healthy smokers  <cit> . it is possible that down-regulation of clara cell secretoglobins, with their anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory and tumor-suppressor activities  <cit> , is a critical component of smoking-related development of copd. the decreased number of scgb1a1-expressing clara cells in smokers is generally accompanied by an increased frequency of mucin-secreting cells  <cit> . indeed, a subset of highly expressed sae-enriched genes, such as c20orf <dig> , and msmb, both associated with mucin-producing secretory cell phenotype  <cit> , were among the smoking-induced genes with the highest amplitude of up-regulation. other genes related to a secretory phenotype such as wfdc <dig>  tspan <dig>  tff <dig>  s100p, and short plunc, were also induced by smoking; each of these genes has been associated with epithelial carcinogenesis  <cit> . thus, a broad induction of a mucin-producing cell secretory program, characteristic of epithelial malignancies, may represent an early molecular phenotype relevant to smoking-induced carcinogenesis in the distal airways.

other smoking-induced changes among the highly expressed sae-enriched genes included up-regulation of oxidative stress-related genes aldh3a <dig> and gsta <dig>  also associated with cancer development  <cit> , and down-regulation of genes associated with epithelial differentiation such as cd <dig>  c9orf <dig> , and luminal cell-associated keratin  <dig> <cit> . some of these changes have not been previously detected by microarrays, likely due to microarray saturation of signal with high levels of expression and/or higher sensitivity of the rna-seq methodology to gene expression changes with relatively low overall fold-difference between the groups.

the ability of rna-seq to assess genes with low steady-state expression was utilized in the present study to characterize the effect of smoking on the expression of low abundance sae genes. although some of changes, such as up-regulation of oxidative stress-responsive genes akr1b <dig>  cabyr, and cyp1b <dig> have been previously reported  <cit> , rna-seq quantification revealed a number of novel smoking-responsive genes, including smoking-induced nos <dig>  a gene encoding nitric oxide isoform usually expressed by endothelial cells but induced in the airway epithelium in association with squamous differentiation  <cit> , and smoking-suppressed ly6/neurotoxin  <dig> , an allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors  <cit> .

functional classification of the low level, smoking-related genes also identified the class of ion transport genes as being modulated by smoking. one example was cngb <dig>  a smoking-induced gene that encodes a cyclic nucleotide gated channel that was first identified for its role in light activated cellular polarization in retinal photoreceptor cells  <cit>  and linked to olfactory receptor function  <cit> . the discovery that airway ciliated cells have olfactory receptors that operate by the same signal transduction pathways as visual rhodopsin  <cit>  suggests a role for cngb <dig> in airway epithelial function. also notable among smoking-dependent genes were a series of ion channels whose overall low expression level in the sae may reflect expression predominantly in neuroendocrine cells which constitute <  <dig> % of total airway epithelium. for example, cacng <dig>  the gamma subunit of a voltage gated calcium channel, is a smoking-induced gene. previous reports suggest that this gamma subunit is expressed primarily in brain  <cit>  but expression of voltage gated calcium channels in neuroendocrine cells and neuroendocrine-derived tumors has been demonstrated  <cit> .

splicing
the mrna sequence reads across exon junctions permit quantitative assessment of the splicing pattern for all genes. by comparing splice events for smokers and nonsmokers, we were able to demonstrate there are no overall smoking-dependent changes in the patterns of splicing for either ubiquitous or sae-enriched genes. this was surprising, since there are known to be substantial genome wide differences in splicing between normal airway epithelium and lung cancer  <cit> , suggesting those splicing-related changes are late events and are not represented in non-transformed airway epithelial cells.

CONCLUSIONS
rna-seq method provides wide dynamic range and low noise. application of rna-seq to sae allowed the unequivocal identification of highly expressed ubiquitous and sae-enriched genes. functional assignment of highly expressed genes showed clara cell specific genes were most abundantly expressed. but genes characteristic of minor cell types such as neuroendocrine cells were also evident. comparison of the transcriptome of nonsmokers to that of healthy smokers allowed the response of sae to cigarette smoke to be quantified and novel smoking-responsive genes to be identified.
