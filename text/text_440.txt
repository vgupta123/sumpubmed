BACKGROUND
dna microarray technology has proven valuable for improving the efficiency of traditional approaches for studying genome structure and function  <cit> . microarray technology allows for the simultaneous examination of thousands of genes for applications ranging from transcriptional profiling   <cit>  to genomic comparisons   <cit> . although microarrays have proven useful, further developments are required to standardize physical and experimental designs  <cit> . in particular, important issues remaining include how to account for and normalize data for probe-to-probe variations, how to address differences between laboratories , and how to determine whether the array is reporting biologically accurate results  <cit> . probe to probe variation is especially important when using arrays to look for copy number and/or presence or absence of genes in comparative studies. that is, probes of variable sequence all designed against the same gene can have different affinities for the target sequence, bringing into question the number of probes required for each target and how this issue changes as a function of probe length and characteristics of the target organism's genome. here, we describe an analysis of the probe to probe variations for an in situ synthesized oligonucleotide array comprised of 60mers designed against the recently sequenced genome of burkholderia cenocepacia j <dig>  b. cenocepacia is a particularly useful model organism for the studies described here. specifically, its genome is gc rich , which challenges the design  and application  of whole-genome microarrays in this organism.

as array technology grows in popularity, issues regarding probe design and repeatability are beginning to be addressed by things such as improved construction methods and standardization of techniques. new array designs such as agilent's ink-jet spotted arrays,  <cit>  have made custom arrays simple to design and construct. this enhanced construction combined with ongoing genome sequencing projects  has made microarray technology applicable to any well-studied organism. however, the increased demand for custom arrays illuminates the challenge that lies within the area of probe design. it is well documented that probe specificity and sensitivity depend on multiple factors including uniqueness, gc content, steric hindrance, and distance from the 3' end of the orf  <cit> . additionally, it has been observed that probes with different sequences designed for the same gene yield different affinities for targets  <cit> . thermodynamic models of probes have been created in an attempt to predict the performance  <cit> . however, theoretical prediction has thus far proven to be a difficult task and often requires additional experimental data  <cit> .

analysis concentrating on the effect of probe sequence on gene expression data has been explored, but the majority of published data has focused on 25mer probes utilized on affymetrix chips. due to the affymetrix platform design as single channel arrays with short probes, data analysis requires sophisticated algorithms comparing perfect match and mismatch probes in an attempt to account for non-specific binding and probe affinity  <cit> . this study will explore alternative probe designs for a custom 60mer agilent ink-jet spotted array that is amenable to competitive hybridization studies . as such, data analysis methods are based on ratios of competing fluorescence, which is expected to minimize the effects of individual probe affinity  <cit> . in addition, longer probes have been shown to decrease non-specific binding and increase overall probe affinity  <cit> .

we designed an oligonucleotide array comprised of  <dig> probes complimentary to the recently sequenced genome of b. cenocepacia j <dig>  an opportunistic pathogen of particular importance to cystic fibrosis research  <cit> . on the array, 9– <dig> replicates of a primary probe  and 4– <dig> alternative probes with unique sequences were included for a set of  <dig> genes . we will report on the quality of the array as a whole as defined by the overall microarray signal to noise ratio and reproducibility between array replicates. we will describe signal variation of primary probe replicates and alternative probes and discuss the identification of probes that produced outlier signals or signal ratios as defined by a variety of different criteria. finally, we will report on the ability of different probe design subscores to predict poor probe performance.

RESULTS
the overall objective of this study was to examine the importance of having multiple probes directed against the same target for an in situ synthesized 60mer oligonucleotide array. we will first discuss the overall quality of the oligonucleotide array, followed with an analysis of primary and alternative probe reproducibility, and conclude with a presentation of outliers. as seen in table  <dig>  this array includes  <dig> replicate probes to examine inter-probe  variance and  <dig> alternative probe designs to explore intra-probe variance.

overall quality of custom oligonucleotide array
prior to examining inter- and intra-probe variance, it was important to first examine the overall array quality as a possible source of variance within our studies. as shown in figure  <dig>  both replicates of the array show similar fluorescence ratios for the same probes, a high signal to noise ratio, and consistent spot morphology. replicates were significantly correlated . an additional measure of overall array quality is the average signal to noise ratio /σbackground). for a normal distribution, a value for s/n greater than  <dig> indicates that the signal is significantly different than the background  <cit> . more generally, s/n ratios greater than  <dig> are considered indicative of high quality arrays  <cit> . the average s/n for these arrays was  <dig> with a range of 4– <dig>  for all probes. thus, the overall reproducibility and quality of this custom designed oligonucleotide array is a minimal consideration in our further analysis. rather, we are able to focus specifically on the determination of probe variation within an array for probes of identical sequence or alternative sequence directed against the same target. this issue is of particular importance not only in studies of gene expression but also gene copy number  where differences in probe affinities are a primary concern  <cit> .

primary probe reproducibility
we designed this array to contain up to  <dig> replicates of the same probe  for  <dig> genes . this allowed us to i) determine if the location of the probe within the microarray had any effect on reported signal intensity values and ratios and ii) obtain relevant statistics for comparisons with alternative probes. overall, the primary probes exhibited excellent reproducibility. chauvenet's criterion, used to identify outliers, distinguishes an acceptable range for data points based on the mean and standard deviation of the group. the number of measurements in the sample set defines how many standard deviations from the mean are acceptable; the larger the set the larger  the acceptable range. for this study the number of acceptable standard deviations ranged from  <dig> – <dig>  for group sizes ranging from 5– <dig>  <cit> . using chauvenet's criterion,  <dig> of  <dig> sets of primary probes included one probe that was defined as an outlier in signal intensity for either heat shock, pre-heat shock, or both conditions. however, of the total number of primary probes, only  <dig> %  were defined as outliers, which is well within a 95% confidence interval.

one advantage of using arrays amenable to dual-channel, competitive hybridization methods is the ability to minimize any differences in probe affinity. that is, since the observed signal intensity is a function of both probe affinity and target concentration, and since probe affinity is thought to be relatively constant over a range of target concentrations, then division of signal intensity values minimizes any affect of probe affinity on observed signal ratios. if the ratio of heat shock to pre-heat shock is greater than  <dig>  the gene is considered to be up-regulated, if this ratio is below  <dig>  the gene is down-regulated, and between these limits there is no significant change in gene expression. of the primary probes, only  <dig> of  <dig> sets had one or more probes return ratios that provided different up/down calls than the majority. moreover, only  <dig> % of all primary probes had ratios that differed significantly from the rest of the subset. the majority of these discrepancies were probe replicates with ratios that were centered at the cut-off value . in fact, if the cut-off values are extended from  <dig>  and  <dig>  to  <dig>  and  <dig>  then only  <dig> probe sets of  <dig> had outlying probes.

because each replicate contained the same sequence, the errors produced amongst primary probe sets were a result of experimental variations as well as spatial variations within each array. given the excellent overall consistency of primary probes, less than 5% were identified as expression outliers or yielded different results when taking the ratio, it is clear that these experimental variations  and spot to spot variation are minimal for these arrays. in addition, outliers of up/down calls were only  <dig> % suggesting that taking the ratio minimizes the effects of probe affinity. we next focused our efforts on examining variance associated with probes of alternative sequence directed against the same target gene.

alternative probe reproducibility
we applied the same analysis described above for the primary probes to the entire probe set  for a particular target. in this analysis primary probe replicates were represented by the mean of the whole set. z-values were calculated for both heat shock and pre-heat shock gene expression  and chauvenet's criterion was applied to them. based on this analysis,  <dig> of  <dig> probe sets produced a probe with outlier signals,  <dig> of which were primary probes.  <dig> % of the total number of alternative probes returned signal values that were considered outliers. recall that the primary probes had a  <dig> % outlier rate due to natural variations . under the assumption of additive error, at best only 6% error is due to differences in sequences. if this assumption cannot be made, however, the outlier rate is still less than 10%, which is sufficient for arrays . this surprisingly small number of outliers and can be linked to the high quality of agilent arrays and the specificity of 60mer probes.

figures 3b–3d provide examples of probe sets with reproducible values and sets that contained probes that returned outlier signal calls. the probe alternatives in figure 3b have very similar signal intensity and ratios that deliver the same conclusion of no change in gene expression. a probe set where no probes were deemed outliers  is shown in figure 3c, however probes bcal1925_ <dig> and bcal1925_ <dig> return different conclusions than the majority of probes in the set. alternatively, in figure 3d probe bcal1467_ <dig> is identified as an outlier but the ratios of each probe concludes there is no change in expression. this is an example where outliers in magnitude of fluorescence are nullified by taking the ratio of the two dyes.

these results suggest that agreement of probe conclusion must also be considered as a measure of proper design . of the total probe sets,  <dig> of  <dig> revealed at least one probe with a different conclusion than the rest. of the  <dig> sets,  <dig> sets had only one differing probe, nine had two differing probes, and five were three-three splits. in addition, in  <dig> of these probe sets the primary probe was in the minority of gene expression conclusions . including half the probes in a split set, about  <dig> % of probes will produce a different gene expression finding than the majority of probes designed for each gene. again, this is similar to the frequency of outliers and is a reasonable amount of error. however, as shown in figure  <dig>  outliers do not necessarily produce faulty conclusions. in fact, only eight of the total  <dig> probes producing faulty conclusions were outliers. therefore, being identified as an outlier in expression level does not necessarily contribute to a different conclusion. this further justifies the theory that taking the ratio of expression levels will minimize the effects of differing probe affinity. for gene expression analysis, errors in conclusions may be more important than actual signal intensity outliers. it appears that error is minimized if data analysis includes taking the ratio rather than by examining gene expression levels only.

prediction of outliers
the program used to design the probes includes subscores for four values: gc content, internal repeat, binding energy and self-annealment. the gc content subscore is strictly based on the percent of gc nucleotides in the oligo sequence, while the other subscores involve more complicated algorithms. internal repeat compares the oligo sequence to its compressed version and the binding energy is of the oligo and its most homologous sequence. finally, self-annealment predicts secondary structure due to self-annealment of the oligo  <cit> .

ideally, one could use these, or similar criteria, to predict probe performance without additional experimental data. however, our analyses indicate that there is no significant relationship between probe design subscore and z-value  or subscore and expression conclusion for this array . this result is not uncommon and is often noted as the inability to predict probe specificity without some preliminary experimental data  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, four major themes were examined: i) overall reproducibility of the arrays, ii) performance of primary probe replicates, iii) performance of alternative probes, and iv) predictive measures for bad probes. overall the arrays appeared to be very reproducible; images of the arrays, including spot intensity and quality, were well replicated and probe performance between two replicates was the same. the high quality of the arrays endorses their application in bacterial studies. primary probes also appeared to be reproducible within a single array with only about  <dig> % identified as outliers. alternative probes were slightly more problematic with closer to 10% outliers and 8% yielding different gene expression conclusions, yet these values are still within a tolerable amount of error for most microarray applications. assuming independent probabilities of being identified as an outlier, including three probes against the same target would substantially reduce microarray error. it appears that analyzing the data using ratios of gene expression allows one to compensate for different probe affinities and non-specific binding. since most two-color array studies compare an experimental condition in one dye channel to a control in the other, actual fluorescence/gene expression level is unimportant so long as the ratios of the two channels yields accurate and repeatable results. since the percent of outliers identified while examining ratios is lower than the percent of outliers identified using signal intensity level, this appears to be a reasonable conclusion. finally, factors used by this particular design program to select probes did not predict poorly performing probes.
