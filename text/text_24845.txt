BACKGROUND
to overcome environmental stresses, plants have developed the ability to perceive and respond to these diverse external signals using specialized physiological and biochemical strategies  <cit> . plant stress responses are generally controlled by a network of specialized genes that are intricately regulated by specific transcription factors   <cit> . the wrky tfs are important members of the stress-related tfs involved in regulating the plant’s environmental stress responses  <cit> . the wrky tf family was named based on the presence of a  <dig> amino acid  wrky domain that is defined by a highly conserved wrkygqk heptapeptide at the n-terminus and a zinc-finger-like motif at the c-terminus. wrky proteins can be classified into three groups  based on the number of wrky domains and the pattern of the zinc-finger motif  <cit> .

the wrky tf family is a large conserved family of tfs that has been reported in many plants  <cit> . wrky tfs have been found to be responsive to various abiotic stresses, including salinity, drought, cold, heat, and abscisic acid  signaling  <cit> . for instance, the nacl-inducible atwrky <dig> and atwrky <dig> mediate abiotic stresses  <cit> . atwrky <dig> is involved in plant responses to aba and drought tolerance  <cit> , and atwrky <dig> mediates the cold sensitivity of mature pollen in arabidopsis <cit> . wrky <dig>  wrky <dig>  and wrky <dig> interact with abar and negatively regulate aba signaling  <cit> . alleles of oswrky45- <dig> and oswrky45- <dig> play different roles in aba signaling and salt stress tolerance in rice  <cit> . wrky <dig> antagonistically interacts with vq <dig> to modulate salinity stress tolerance  <cit> . additionally, bcwrky <dig>  a novel cold-inducible gene from pak-choi  enhances the cold, salt and dehydration stress tolerance in transgenic tobacco  <cit> .

because of the functional complexity of the wrky genes involved in environmental stresses, many approaches have been used to explore the unknown mechanisms of the stress response processes. previous studies have demonstrated the power of co-expression analysis as a candidate discovery tool  <cit> , which encouraged us to explore this approach for the identification of genes putatively involved in these interesting biological processes. additionally, a co-expression analysis of oswrkys under biotic and abiotic stress conditions has been reported  <cit> .

pak-choi is an important brassica crop with exceptional cold resistance  <cit> , and its nearest genetic relative that has been sequenced is chinese cabbage   <cit> , which provides an effective model for pak-choi research. although wrkys have been reported to mediate various stresses, the number of wrky members in pak-choi and their roles in response to abiotic stress tolerance were still unknown. here, we cloned and identified  <dig> stress-inducible wrky orthologs from pak-choi, and we systematically investigated their organization, subcellular localization, and expression patterns under multiple abiotic stresses. in addition, we simultaneously measured co-expression of the stress-inducible wrky orthologs in pak-choi and arabidopsis thaliana. we subsequently established a co-regulatory network of stress-inducible bcwrkys to multiple abiotic stresses, and indicated the possible interactions of stress-inducible bcwrky gene pairs.

RESULTS
cloning stress-inducible bcwrky genes from pak-choi
we isolated  <dig> bcwrky genes from a multiple abiotic stress-treated pak-choi cdna library using a homology cloning method, which was based on sequence information from the a. thaliana wrky gene family and the chinese cabbage chiifu genome. we first designed degenerate and oligo  primers to amplify the conserved regions of wrky orthologs. based on the pcr products’ sequencing results, we designed gene-specific primers  and performed 5′-and 3′-race to amplify the full-length cdna sequences of bcwrkys from the stress-induced pak-choi cdna library. the stress-inducible pak-choi wrky genes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig>  base pairs  and included  <dig> orfs. these orfs were confirmed by sequencing, and the sequences were submitted to genbank . the bcwrky genes were named based on their similarity to the atwrky orthologs, and the molecular properties and sequence characteristics of the putative bcwrky proteins were also analyzed. among the  <dig> bcwrky proteins, the isoelectric point ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig> , and the molecular weight ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  kda .

phylogenetic analysis and identification of conserved motifs
to investigate the phylogenetic relationship and structural features of the wrky proteins in pak-choi, an unrooted maximum likelihood  phylogenetic tree and a linear distribution map of the conserved motifs in the putative bcwrky proteins were produced . these were based on the multiple sequence alignment of the  <dig> putative bcwrky proteins, ranging in size from  <dig> to  <dig>  aa, using clustalw in mega  <dig> software  and the meme suite to detect conserved motifs in the bcwrky protein sequences. the bcwrkys were organized into three large clades, containing wrky members that had the same or similar conserved motif distributions. the three clades were named i, ii , and iii, based on the number of wrky domains and the type of zinc finger in the c-terminal wrky domain. group i consisted of  <dig> members containing two wrky domains, while groups ii and iii contained  <dig> and nine members, respectively, and each member contained only one wrky domain . the distributions of different motifs formed groups, and the shared motifs appeared in all groups, such as motif  <dig>  motif  <dig>  and motif  <dig> . of the eight motifs, motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  which represented the distribution of c-or n-terminal wrky domains, respectively, were both contained in the wrky aa residues, and motif  <dig> contained nuclear localization signal  sequences, which could represent the nls distribution of bcwrky proteins . group i shared conserved motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  except for bcwrky <dig>  which lacked motif  <dig>  group ii contained five subgroups  based on zinc finger types and consisted of  <dig> wrky members, which contained several common and specific motifs, such as motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> that were shared by group ii, and motifs  <dig> and  <dig> that were only found in group iia and iib .

significant motifs  of more than  <dig> amino acid length were predicted by meme search.

alignment and comparison of wrky domains
to compare phylogenetic relationships among the wrky domains,  <dig> wrky domains that contained the highly conserved n-terminal wrkygqk motif and c-terminal zinc finger were extracted and aligned from  <dig> bcwrky proteins. the wrky domains were classified into the eight subgroups and named ict, int, iia-e, and iii . eleven members of group i, which contained two wrky domains, including a c-or n-terminal wrky domain, were separately divided into groups int and ict. the  <dig> wrky domains of group ii each contained one wrkygqk motif and a c2c2-type zinc finger motif , and could be classified into five distinct subgroups  based on different conserved motifs contained in the wrky domain. group iia was comprised of bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky <dig>  and bcwrky <dig>  which each contained motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the wrky domain and motifs  <dig> and  <dig> outside of the wrky domain. group iib had nine members that each contained motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the wrky domain and motifs  <dig> and  <dig> outside of the wrky domain. group iic and iid had  <dig> and eight members, respectively, and contained motifs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> in the wrky domains, but the motif positions were different. the conserved motifs of group iid only occurred at the c-terminus of the wrky proteins. the group iie wrky domains only contained motifs  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . group iii had nine wrky members that only shared motifs  <dig> and  <dig>  and whose wrky domains contained the c2hc-type  of zinc finger motif . the patterns of wrky domains and zinc finger motifs in the bcwrky proteins were similar to the patterns of arabidopsis wrky domains  and were consistent with a previous study on groups ii  and iii   <cit> .

by comparing the  <dig> wrky domains, a phylogenetic tree with five clades was constructed . in terms of the eight wrky domain patterns, the ict group was placed in clade i, and the next branch, clade ii, consisted of group iic. this was considered as an intermediate between clades i and iii, which involved groups ict and int. while clade iii, including the int group, was placed as an original node, the remaining  <dig> domains were clustered into clade iv  and clade v . these results illustrated the evolution of pak-choi wrky domains from group i to group ii or iii . for example, bcwrky <dig> and bcwrky <dig>  belonged to group iic, but they were clustered into the int group in the phylogenetic tree , and bcwrky <dig> protein belonged to group i, containing two wrky domains, but clustered into the iic group in the phylogenetic tree . a similar evolutionary pattern for wrky domains has been reported in arabidopsis and rice  <cit> .

subcellular localization analysis of bcwrkys
to investigate the subcellular localization of putative bcwrky proteins, we used nlstradamus with the default settings. we found  <dig> bcwrky proteins contained nlss. additionally, we used nucpred and wolf psort to predict the nuclear localization scores of the bcwrky proteins. fifty bcwrky proteins had a nucpres-score of ≥  <dig>  and  <dig> had nuclear localization scores of ≥  <dig>  using wolf psort . a consensus of the results generated predicted that most bcwrkys  localized at the nucleus . additionally, we used a transient expression system in onion epidermal cells to test the subcellular localization of bcwrky proteins. the yellow fluorescent marker protein  was fused to bcwrky <dig> and bcwrky <dig> and the expression of the fusion genes was tracked by the marker’s signal . when yfp alone was expressed the fluorescence was observed in the cytosol and nucleus , while the yellow fluorescence of the bcwrky25-yfp and bcwrky40-yfp fusions were observed in the nuclear region . thus, bcwrky <dig> and  <dig> were localized to the nucleus, which agreed with the protein subcellular localization prediction. these results indicate that the properties of the bcwrky proteins define them as transcription factors.

expression patterns of bcwrkys under multiple abiotic stresses
among the  <dig> isolated wrky genes,  <dig> genes were detected and found to be significantly induced in response to aba and abiotic stresses in pak-choi leaves. of the  <dig> expressed stress-inducible bcwrkys,  <dig> were up-regulated in at least one of the five treatments  and six genes were down-regulated under heat treatment . during multiple abiotic stress treatments, bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> were all highly expressed during an aba treatment time course. similarly, bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> under cold stress treatments, had significantly upgraded expression levels. a heat treatment also strongly induced high expression levels in some genes, such as bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . additionally, bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> had high expression levels under salt treatment and osmotic treatment. meanwhile, most bcwrkys’ expression levels peaked at the 12-h or 24-h time-points. however, the expression peaks for bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> occurred at the 1-h time-point and bcwrky <dig> and bcwrky <dig> peaked at the 6-h time-point under cold treatment . interestingly, bcwrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> were all predominantly expressed in response to multiple stress treatments, and the simultaneous expression of the bcwrkys was detected. these expression processes exhibited some low to high or high to low curve changes over the  <dig> h time course, showing that the inducible responses of bcwrkys to multiple abiotic stresses is a dynamic process. the results indicated that stress-inducible bcwrkys were strongly induced and coordinately mediated in response to multiple abiotic stresses in pak-choi leaves.

co-regulatory networks of bcwrkys in response to multiple abiotic stresses
co-regulatory networks were established based on the pearson correlation coefficient of stress-inducible bcwrky gene pairs using log <dig> transformed qpcr data . all pearson correlations that were significant at the  <dig>  significance level  were collected and visualized by cytoscape  <dig>  to construct stress co-regulatory networks of bcwrkys. there were  <dig> nodes representing  <dig> stress-inducible bcwrkys separately connected by  <dig> edges, which represented the pearson correlation coefficients of the co-regulatory gene pairs . in the co-regulatory networks, most co-regulatory gene pairs  appeared to have positive significant correlations, except for four bcwrky gene pairs, bcwrky2-bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky6-bcwrky <dig>  bcwrky6-bcwrky <dig>  and bcwrky6-bcwrky <dig>  which had negative correlations . in addition, bcwrky6-bcwrky <dig> had a large negative correlation at the  <dig>  significance level. among  <dig> positively correlated gene pairs,  <dig> and  <dig> gene pairs were significant at the  <dig>  and  <dig>  levels, respectively . among the  <dig> mutually linked nodes, brwtky <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> had more edges, with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively . these results suggested that they represented central nodes in the co-regulatory networks of bcwrkys in response to multiple abiotic stresses. all data used to calculate the correlations are shown in additional file 3: table s <dig> 

to validate the co-regulatory relationships of the bcwrky genes, we constructed an evident interaction co-regulatory network of wrky orthologs through the string  <dig>  database based on the stress-inducible bcwrky orthologs in arabidopsis . among the  <dig> co-regulatory wrky members, each of them existed in at least two mutual relationships with others in the given datasets . those were further verified, and they supported the co-regulatory networks of stress-inducible bcwrkys in which wrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> represented central nodes.

discussion
this study reported the isolation and identification of  <dig> stress-inducible bcwrky genes  using a homologous gene cloning method from a stress-induced pak-choi cdna library. we also systematically surveyed the structure, phylogeny, and conserved motifs of the bcwrkys and measured the putative protein localization. in addition, a co-expression analysis of bcwrkys was performed to explore the co-regulatory information of wrky tfs. based on a sequence alignment of the bcwrky domains , we clearly found phenomena similar to those previously reported  <cit> . this indicated that possessing different numbers of wrky domains and zinc finger motifs, and structural variations of the wrky domain, may produce some novel wrky members . for example, the bcwrky <dig> protein contains two of the same type of wrky domains, belonging to group i; however, in a phylogenetic analysis it can be clustered together with group iic members, while bcwrky <dig> with wrky domain features of group iic was clustered into a clade with group iid members because of the absence of some motifs . these results also support the belief that group i wrkys may represent the ancestral form of the wrky family  <cit> . additionally, the conservation of wrky domains implies a conserved function for wrky tfs  <cit> . for example, the subcellular localization of bcwrky <dig> and bcwrky <dig> proteins was in the nucleus, which was appropriate for tfs, thus supporting their classification as functional tfs  <cit> .

although the mechanisms of the wrkys’ responses to multiple abiotic stresses needs further investigation, the co-expression analysis, which has the ability to measure large numbers of gene expressions, provides a powerful tool for identifying groups of genes and discovering novel regulators involved in the signal transport of plant stress responses. previous studies have performed co-expression analyses  <cit> , and found many unknown relationships and novel genes encoding proteins involved in similar expression patterns under different conditions. the co-expression analysis of arabidopsis and pak-choi wrky orthologs  indicated co-regulatory relationships and key regulators of  <dig> stress-inducible bcwrkys in response to multiple abiotic stresses, and it further indicated the important roles of the wrky tf mutual interactions to mediate complex biological processes  <cit> . these findings will help in identifying and understanding more interactive relationships among the wrkys and will elucidate more co-regulatory relationships for wrkys under multiple abiotic stresses.

CONCLUSIONS
this study isolated and characterized  <dig> pak-choi stress-inducible wrky genes, indicated that  <dig> bcwrky genes co-regulated multiple abiotic stress responses in pak-choi leaves, and established a co-regulatory network of stress-inducible bcwrkys. the co-regulatory network showed that wrky <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were central regulators and had potentially interactive relationships. this study also revealed a method of measuring the common and distinct functions of stress-inducible bcwrkys among multiple abiotic stress responses, which may aid in exploring the molecular mechanisms of wrkys in response to abiotic stresses in plants.
