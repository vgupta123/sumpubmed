BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa, an ubiquitous environmental gram-negative microrganism, is one of most important opportunistic bacteria in hospital-acquired infections  <cit> . it is responsible for acute and chronic lung infections in artificially ventilated  <cit>  and in cystic fibrosis patients  <cit> , and for septicemia in immunocompromised patients, including transplant and cancer patients, as well as patients with severe burn wounds. nosocomial p. aeruginosa strains are characterized by an intrinsic resistance to various antimicrobial agents and common antibiotic therapies. the low permeability of the major outer membrane porins and the presence of multiple drug efflux pumps are factors that contribute to mechanisms of drug resistance in this species  <cit> . this high resistance leads to several therapeutic complications and is associated with treatment failure and death. the development of a vaccine against p. aeruginosa for active and/or passive immunization is therefore necessary as another approach to therapy.

despite high numbers of patients who may develop p. aeruginosa infections and the threat of antibiotic treatment failure due to bacterial resistance, there is surprisingly no p. aeruginosa vaccine currently available on the market, although many attempts have been made in the past. a number of different vaccines and several monoclonal antibodies have been developed in the last decades for active and passive vaccination against p. aeruginosa  <cit> . different antigens of p. aeruginosa, such as the outer membrane proteins , lps, toxins, pili and flagella, have been investigated as possible targets for the development of vaccines. vaccination with outer membrane protein antigens has been shown to be efficacious against p. aeruginosa infection in a number of studies using killed whole cells  <cit> , purified outer membrane preparations  <cit> , isolated outer membrane proteins  <cit> , protein fusions, or synthetic peptides representing protective epitopes  <cit> . the p. aeruginosa major constitutive porin protein, oprf, which has previously been shown to be antigenic  <cit>  and has high homology among pseudomonas strains  <cit> , was also chosen as a vaccine target  <cit> . this protein has been shown to provide protection in a mouse model of systemic infection  <cit> , a mouse burn infection model, and rodent models of acute  <cit>  and chronic lung infection  <cit> .

while many of experimental vaccines and monoclonal antibodies have been tested in preclinical trials, few have reached clinical phases because it is difficult to study cystic fibrosis patients, in which improved antibiotic therapy impaired a proper evaluation of the vaccine's efficacies  <cit>  and none of these vaccines has obtained market authorization  <cit> . new promising perspectives for the development of vaccination strategies against various types of pathogens are the use of antigen-pulsed dendritic cells  as biological immunizing agents  <cit> .

dcs are specialized antigen-presenting cells that play a dual role in inducing adaptive immune responses to foreign antigens and in maintaining t cell tolerance to self  <cit> . although there are still numerous controversial and unresolved issues surrounding dc-mediated immune responses against pathogens  <cit> , the role of dcs in immunity to p. aeruginosa is undisputed  <cit> . moreover, dcs have a central role in developing new vaccine strategies due to some prominent features, such as location, antigen handling, maturation, and subsets  <cit> .

we designed and tested the efficacy of oprf-pulsed dcs for a vaccine based upon adoptive transfer in mice with p. aeruginosa infection. to overcome the problem of quantity and purity related to the purification of oprf from bacterial outer membrane, we resorted to recombinant oprf, c-terminal part of which carries an important protective epitope  <cit> . the results reported in this paper demonstrate the ability of mouse dcs pulsed with purified or recombinant oprf to protect mice against p. aeruginosa infection and inflammation.

RESULTS
native or recombinant oprf activate dcs in vitro
to assess the immunogenic capacity of native or recombinant oprf, we evaluated levels of costimulatory antigen expression  and cytokine production of dcs pulsed with different concentrations  of either native or recombinant oprf or lps, as a positive control. similar to lps, both porins increased cd <dig> and cd <dig> expression in a dose-dependent manner . class ii mhc antigen expression was also significantly increased by  <dig> μg/ml of both porins . in terms of cytokine production, both porins induced equivalent levels of tnf-α production, which was partially toll like receptor 4-dependent for the native porin but almost totally tlr4-independent for the recombinant porin , a finding confirming the absence of lps contamination in the his-oprf preparation. interestingly, levels of il-12p <dig> production were higher and those of il- <dig> and il- <dig> lower in dcs stimulated with the recombinant porin as compared to the native porin , a finding suggesting the superior capacity of the recombinant oprf to activate dcs for th <dig> priming.

oprf-pulsed dcs protect mice from pao <dig> infection

as a similar degree of protection in terms of reduced bacterial clearance was also observed upon infecting the mice intratracheally , we concluded that the lower airways of the lung are the sites of both the induction and expression phase of the dc-induced resistance against p. aeruginosa.

to correlate vaccine-induced resistance with pattern of inflammatory and th cytokine production in mice with infection, levels of pro-inflammatory  or anti-inflammatory  cytokines were measured in the lung homogenates and those of th <dig>  or th <dig>  in antigen-stimulated tlns. the results show that levels of tnf-α were significantly reduced whereas those of il-12p <dig> and il- <dig> both increased in vaccinated mice . in the tlns, the levels of th1/ifn-γ production were increased in mice vaccinated with dcs pulsed with either porin, while those of th2/il- <dig> were decreased, particularly with the his-oprf-pulsed dcs. interestingly, mice vaccinated with his-oprf-pulsed dcs also showed increased levels of il- <dig> production. as in cystic fibrosis  patients priming of the cellular immune system towards a th1-like pattern seems to be of potential advantage  <cit> , while pulmonary th <dig> responses are seen in cf patients with pseudomonas pneumonia  <cit> , our data suggest that vaccine-induced resistance correlates with the activation of protective th <dig> cell responses and decrease of non-protective th <dig> responses.

to correlate these findings with levels of pulmonary inflammation, we evaluated sections of lungs from uninfected, infected or vaccinated mice for inflammatory cell recruitment and lung injury . in the fig. 4a and 4b haematoxylin-eosin sections from mice infected with pao <dig> strain show the presence of lung parenchyma, with an evident inflammatory infiltrate, mainly constituted of polymorphous granulocytes, involving small bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli, up to the formation of abscesses with tissue necrosis.

in contrast, inflammatory cell recruitment was greatly reduced in the lungs of mice vaccinated with n-orpf-pulsed dcs  or his-oprf-pulsed dcs .

oprf-pulsed dcs protect mice from infection with the clinical isolate
because chronic lung infections with p. aeruginosa are associated with the diversification of the persisting clone into different morphotypes  <cit>  and p. aeruginosa isolates from chronic cf lung infections are phenotypically quite distinct from those causing acute infections in other settings  <cit> , we assessed whether the vaccinating potential of porin-pulsed dcs would extend to a mucoid strain isolated from cf patients. to this purpose, mice were treated, infected and evaluated for microbiological and immunological parameters as above. figures 5a, b and  <dig> show the cumulative results of these experiments. consistent with the high virulence of mucoid bacterial strains  <cit> , the clearance of the bacteria from the lung was delayed, as judged by the high level of bacterial colonization at  <dig> days after infection . nevertheless, treatment with either type of pulsed dcs significantly reduced bacterial growth, although to a lesser extent compared to pao1-infected mice . although levels of th <dig> cytokines  were significantly higher and those of th2/il- <dig> lower in dcs-vaccinated mice as compared to untreated mice, levels of tnf-α were not significantly decreased in dcs-treated versus untreated mice. moreover, although increased if compared to untreated mice, levels of il- <dig> were not as high as those induced in pao1-infected mice . lung inflammatory cell recruitment was significantly reduced by treatment with either type of pulsed dcs, although to a lesser extent compared to pao1-infected mice . together, our data indicate that porin-pulsed dcs may induce immune protection against pulmonary infection by p. aeruginosa with a significant reduction of inflammation.

it is believed that the initial site of colonization by p. aeruginosa is localized to the upper respiratory epithelium; therefore, inducing mucosal immunity to this pathogen appears to be an ideal strategy for the prevention of infection. previous studies suggested that systemic immunity, from either oral vaccination  <cit>  or i.p. vaccination  <cit>  with p. aeruginosa vaccine constructs, was as effective as mucosal delivery of the vaccine in a mucosal challenge.

we found here that peripheral delivery of porin-pulsed dcs also resulted in active immunization against pseudomonas pneumonia. protection occurred against pneumonia induced by either intranasal or intratracheal delivery of the bacteria, a finding consistent with the above-mentioned studies and confirming that peripheral immunization may result in mucosal and parenchymal protection at distal sites.

protection was associated with increased bacterial clearance, decreased inflammatory pathology and the occurrence of th <dig> immunity in the draining lymph nodes. although antibodies have a crucial role in protection against p. aeruginosa infection, cell-mediated immunity is also important in the clearance of the bacterium. the observation that the occurrence of a protective th <dig> reactivity coexisted with the detection of significant levels of il- <dig> is intriguing. it is known that high levels of il- <dig> are associated with protection in patients with cf and il- <dig> is required for the induction of regulatory t cells dampening inflammation in infections  <cit> . whether il- <dig> produced in dcs-vaccinated mice may serve to support the growth of regulatory t cells preventing prolonged inflammation is an attractive working hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
there is surprisingly no p. aeruginosa vaccine currently available on the market, although many attempts have been made in the past. this raises the question as to whether p. aeruginosa is an antigenically variable microorganism that can escape immune recognition and/or induce immunological non-responsiveness as is seen with other bacteria such as borrelia, bordetella or neisseria. because the organism has the ability to undergo phenotypic variation due to changing environmental conditions such as in the airways of cf patients  <cit> , the highly conserved antigens such as oprs represent ideal candidates for vaccines. however, despite highly efficient technologies to express proteins and to purify protein and carbohydrate antigens in high yields under good manufacturing practices standards, the lack of a protective p. aeruginosa vaccine is a reality. our study would suggest that the use of porin-pulsed dcs may represent a possible candidate vaccine against pseudomonas infection. as dcs conferred protection against both the conventional pao <dig> strain and the more virulent mucoid strain, this finding highlights the potential of dcs to overcome the mucin-dependent negative regulation of immune responses to p. aeruginosa  <cit> .

confirming the efficacy of several tested opr vaccine preparations in generating protection against different p. aeruginosa challenges in preclinical studies  <cit> , oprf-pulsed dcs not only induced th <dig> resistance to the infection but also ameliorate inflammatory pathology. this finding is of relevance considering the contribution of a self-sustaining cycle of airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation to lung disease in cf  <cit> . cf lung disease is characterized by neutrophilic airway inflammation, increased expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and infection by a narrow repertoire of bacterial pathogens, with p. aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacia complex being the most clinically significant pathogens. current therapy for cf lung disease relies on antibiotics to treat bacterial infection combined with airway clearance strategies to mobilize viscid secretions. however, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to be beneficial for patients with cf  <cit> , especially for younger patients with mild disease. recent data indicate that tlr4- and flagellin-induced signals mediate most of the acute inflammatory response to pseudomonas  <cit> . the fact that dcs activation by recombinant oprf occurred independently of tlr <dig> would suggest that avoiding the damaging inflammatory pathway to the bacterium may be of benefit in vaccine-induced protection. overall, our study points to the successful combination of recombinant porins and dcs for vaccine-induced protection in the relative absence of innate danger signals. however, much needs to be done to work out principles that govern the regulation of the human immune system in vivo in patients with pneumonia, including the immunobiology of dcs in immune resistance to pseudomonas.
