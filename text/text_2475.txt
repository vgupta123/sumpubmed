BACKGROUND
dna methyltransferases  catalyze the addition of methyl residues to cytosine bases within cpg dinucleotides to increase the information content of the genome. to date, dna methylation is the best studied epigenetic modification and is found in the genomes of vertebrates, plants and fungi as well as some species of bacteria and invertebrates  <cit> . in mammals, the bulk of dna methylation patterns are established during gametogenesis and early embryogenesis and as such dna methylation is an essential developmental process. dna methylation is important for the silencing of tandem and interspersed repeat elements and for genomic imprinting and x-chromosome inactivation  <cit> . several human disorders are linked to abnormalities in dna methylation profiles; they include cancer, rett syndrome, icf syndrome, as well as genomic imprinting diseases such as angelman, prader-willi and beckwith-wiedemann syndromes  <cit> .

dnmt enzymes are related by the well-conserved motifs in their catalytic domains and are required for two types of methyltransferase activity, de novo and maintenance methylation. dnmt <dig> is considered the major maintenance methyltransferase as it is the only dnmt known to exhibit a strong affinity for targeting hemimethylated dna  <cit> . mouse embryos made completely deficient in this enzyme through gene targeting die prior to midgestation and exhibit a 95% loss of methylation when compared to normal embryos  <cit> . homozygous dnmt1-deficient embryos have hypomethylated repeat element sequences and biallelic expression of imprinted genes  <cit> . an oocyte-specific transcript, dnmt1o, results from the alternative splicing of 5' sex-specific exons within dnmt <dig>  <cit> . heterozygous embryos derived from dnmt1o null females show abnormalities in the methylation imprint maintenance and die pre-natally  <cit> . while dnmt <dig> is the best conserved of the eukaryotic dnmts and possesses all the conserved motifs required for dnmt function, dnmt <dig> has recently been shown to specifically methylate position  <dig> in trnaasp  <cit> .

in contrast to the predominant maintenance activity of dnmt <dig> and dnmt1o, studies have revealed that dnmt3a and dnmt3b transfer methyl groups to hemimethylated and unmethylated substrates at roughly equivalent rates  <cit> . gene targeting studies have shown that dnmt3a-/- mice survive a few weeks post-natally, while dnmt3b-/- embryos die prior to birth  <cit> . dnmt3l also belongs to the dnmt <dig> subfamily because of the cysteine rich motif it shares with dnmt3a and dnmt3b. however unlike any of the other dnmts that have been characterized, dnmt3l lacks the conserved motifs necessary for enzymatic function and therefore lacks dnmt catalytic activity. instead dnmt3l has been shown to be a potent stimulator of dnmt3a and dnmt3b by changing their conformation and favouring their binding to adomet and target sequences  <cit> . remarkably, dnmt3l gene targeting experiments have shown it to be essential for normal spermatogenesis, in particular for meiosis, and required for the methylation of dna within the differentially methylated regions  of imprinted genes in both oocytes and male germ cells  <cit> .

genomic imprinting refers to those genes, numbering roughly  <dig> to date, which are expressed exclusively from one allele in a parent of origin specific manner. the parental allele specific expression of imprinted genes requires some epigenetic modification to differentially mark the two alleles during germ cell development. studies have revealed the majority of imprinted genes to be regulated by imprinting control elements  which harbour allele specific dna methylation  <cit> . in the male germ line, dna methylation imprint establishment on paternally methylated genes is initiated pre-natally in prospermatogonia  <cit> , while maternally methylated imprinted genes acquire their methylation imprint during the postnatal growth phase of oogenesis  <cit> .

although dna methylation is a well studied aspect of imprinted gene regulation, until recently little has been understood about which enzymes are involved in the de novo methylation that marks imprinted genes during gametogenesis. while dnmt3l gene targeting studies clearly showed this enzyme to be essential for the establishment of methylation imprints in both germ lines  <cit> , the involvement of dnmt3a and dnmt3b in genomic imprinting remained unclear because of the poor survival and development of dnmt3a and dnmt3b null mice  <cit> . conditional germ cell specific knockouts of these enzymes showed that dnmt3a, in a manner similar to dnmt3l, is essential for the de novo methylation of imprinted genes in male and female germ cells  <cit> .

we have previously investigated the temporal dynamics that underlie methylation imprint establishment in oocytes  <cit> . here, we examined the expression patterns of the dnmt <dig> family of enzymes during oocyte development in normal and dnmt-deficient mice in an effort to better understand the role these enzymes play in establishing and/or maintaining dna methylation patterns during gametogenesis. we used real-time rt-pcr  to profile the expression of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l in postnatal oocytes at five different developmental time points and investigated the influence of oocyte diameter on expression patterns. we also determined which dnmt3a isoforms were expressed in growing oocytes. to better understand the role dnmt3l plays in establishing methylation imprints, we studied the methylation profile of multiple imprinted genes in dnmt3l deficient oocytes at  <dig> dpp, the time point when we have previously shown the majority of dna methylation to be established in oocytes. while dnmt3l clearly has an essential role in ensuring the methylation and silencing of retrotransposons in male germ cells, it is unknown whether it serves the same function in the female germ line. we therefore also investigated the methylation profiles of iaps and line- <dig> elements in dnmt3l null oocytes. finally, hypothesizing that these enzymes may be coordinately regulated during development, we monitored the effect of dnmt3l and dnmt1o depletion on the expression profiles of the other dnmts.

RESULTS
developmental profile of dnmt3a, dnmt3b, and dnmt3l during postnatal oocyte growth
we determined the expression dynamics of dna methyltransferases in oocytes at five time points spanning the period of postnatal oocyte growth: at  <dig> dpp, oocytes collected were from primordial follicles that had not yet entered the growth phase and measured roughly 10– <dig> μm in diameter;  <dig> dpp represented a pool of early-growing oocytes ranging greatly from  <dig> to  <dig> μm in diameter with roughly half measuring  <dig> μm or less; at  <dig> dpp our samples consisted of mid-growing oocytes up to  <dig> μm in diameter with only about 5% of oocytes measuring less than  <dig> μm; fully grown gv stage oocytes were collected at  <dig> dpp; and mature ovulated metaphase ii  oocytes were isolated from superovulated  <dig> week old females.

to normalize for variations in rna input and extraction efficiency, amplification of spiked rabbit α-globin was performed for every experiment  <cit> . the choice of an exogenous normalizer stemmed from the absence of genes known to be expressed at a constant level throughout oogenesis . the standard curve method was used to determine the fold changes in expression which were then calibrated to the mii oocyte sample. the qrt-pcr results plotted depict the mean from one representative experiment where each sample was repeated in triplicate.

qrt-pcr results for dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l are depicted in figures 1a, b, and 1c, respectively. expression of these transcripts increased from  <dig> dpp oocytes to  <dig> dpp oocytes, where expression peaked and then decreased slightly in mii oocytes, coinciding with the loss of transcripts which occurs in oocytes after meiotic maturation  <cit> . in the case of dnmt3a, the relative expression at  <dig> dpp was significantly higher than the expression measured at  <dig> dpp ; while there was no significant difference between the same timepoints for dnmt3b or dnmt3l. dnmt3b expression was significantly upregulated between  <dig> and  <dig> dpp , suggesting a more gradual accumulation of transcripts in mid-growing oocytes . the increase in dnmt3l expression was highly significant between  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp  and showed the greatest fold increase observed for any of the genes or timepoints. with respect to changes occurring during the later stages of oocyte growth, a further significant increase in expression was seen for both dnmt3a and dnmt3l between the  <dig> dpp and full grown gv stage oocytes at  <dig> dpp. this late increase may correlate with previously observed findings that a subset of maternally methylated imprinted genes acquires methylation late during oogenesis  <cit> . another representative replicate showing similar dynamics in expression is included in the additional files .

relationship of oocyte diameter on dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt3l and dnmt1o expression
having previously determined that oocyte diameter at  <dig> dpp correlates with dna methylation levels on the imprinted gene snrpn  <cit> , we determined whether the expression levels of dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt3l and dnmt1o also changed with increasing oocyte diameter. oocytes at  <dig> dpp were collected and pooled according to their diameter: "small" referring to oocytes  <dig> to  <dig> μm in diameter and "big" referring to oocytes  <dig> to  <dig> μm in diameter. for each of the dnmt genes examined,  <dig> to  <dig> μm oocytes showed significantly higher  levels of transcripts . for both dnmt3a and dnmt3b, relative expression levels in "big" oocytes were roughly  <dig> times higher than that in "small" oocytes at  <dig> dpp. dnmt1o showed a less marked increase with oocyte diameter, with larger oocytes only showing a two-fold increase in expression. the most dramatic increase in transcript level as a result of increased oocyte diameter was seen for dnmt3l, with the expression in  <dig> to  <dig> μm oocytes being  <dig> times that seen in  <dig> to  <dig> μm oocytes.

dna methylation profile of snrpn, peg <dig>  igf2r, h <dig>  and retrotransposons iap and line- <dig> in dnmt3l-/- oocytes
to better understand the nature of the methylation imprint defect in dnmt3l-/- oocytes, we investigated the methylation profile of three maternally methylated imprinted genes and one paternally methylated imprinted gene in  <dig> dpp oocytes . using bisulfite sequencing, we analyzed all four genes in one pooled sample of oocytes and found the regions within the snrpn, peg <dig> and igf2r dmrs sequenced to be unmethylated . to control for somatic cell contamination we determined the methylation status of h <dig>  which is methylated in male germ cells but not in oocytes, and found it to be unmethylated in our  <dig> dpp sample. surprisingly, although we found the maternally methylated imprinted genes to be unmethylated, cpg sites analyzed within the iap ltr from the same set of oocytes remained normally methylated . fisher's exact analysis using wild-type iap bisulfite data for this time point  <cit>  showed that the cpg methylation levels obtained between wild type and dnmt3l depleted oocytes were not significantly different .

southern analysis with methylation sensitive enzymes using iap 5' ltr and line- <dig> 5' utr probes also showed these sequences to be normally methylated in mature metaphase ii oocytes therefore suggesting that in contrast to male germ cells, dnmt3l is not required for establishment or maintenance of retrotransposon methylation in the female germ line . while there did appear to be a slight hypomethylation of these sequences in homozygous mutant oocytes, it is important to note that these sequences are not normally fully methylated in wild-type oocytes and when compared to the dramatic differences previously observed in male germ cells  <cit>  the overall pattern of digestion is not significantly different. somatic cumulus cells also showed no difference in retrotransposon methylation levels .

expression of dnmt <dig> transcripts in dnmt1o and dnmt3l depleted oocytes
in addition to our objective of determining the developmental dynamics of the dnmt <dig> genes in postnatal oocytes summarized in figure  <dig>  we also wished to investigate whether the expression of these transcripts changed in response to the depletion of dnmt3l or dnmt1o. we chose to compare expression profiles after depletion of these two dnmts in particular because the former provides a mouse model where maternal methylation imprints are affected  <cit> , while the latter represents a model where oocyte methylation imprint patterns are unchanged  <cit> . again, we used qrt-pcr to look at the expression of dnmt3a and dnmt3b in oocytes isolated from heterozygous and homozygous dnmt3l females at  <dig> dpp  and  <dig> dpp . expression results were calibrated to the value obtained for the heterozygous oocytes and normalized to rabbit α-globin transcript levels. when compared to the heterozygous oocytes transcript levels, dnmt3a and dnmt3b relative expression was up-regulated in response to dnmt3l depletion, increasing roughly 2- and 3-fold respectively. the increase in dnmt3b expression was highly significant  while the increase in dnmt3a expression only approached significance but was reproducible. we also analyzed dnmt3l expression levels and found heterozygous  <dig> dpp oocytes to have  <dig> times the transcript levels as homozygous mutant  <dig> dpp oocytes , confirming the purity of our samples . analysis of dnmt3a and dnmt3b expression changes as a result of dnmt3l depletion in  <dig> dpp gv oocytes also showed up-regulation of dnmt3a and dnmt3b, although not to the same degree as that seen at  <dig> dpp .

these changes at the rna expression level were also investigated by western blot analysis for dnmt3a and dnmt3b in  <dig> dpp wild-type and homozygous dnmt3l oocytes . this also allowed us to examine which isoforms of the de novo methyltransferases are present in growing oocytes. as shown in figure 5a, both dnmt3a isoforms, dnmt3a and dnmt3a <dig>  were detected in  <dig> dpp growing oocytes. qrt-pcr analysis also showed the transcript variants of dnmt3a to be of similar abundance in growing oocytes . although we saw an increase in dnmt3a expression in dnmt3l depleted oocytes, a comparable increase in the amount of either dnmt3a isoform in the absence of dnmt3l was not observed when compared to the loading control . in contrast, the significant increase in expression found for dnmt3b in dnmt3l -/- oocytes was also seen at the protein level . it appears that the major isoform of dnmt3b in growing oocytes is dnmt3b <dig>  since the band migrates to the same height as the main isoform in type b spermatogonia  <cit> .

we next looked at the changes in expression of dnmt3a, dnmt3b, and dnmt3l in  <dig> dpp and  <dig> dpp oocytes isolated from dnmt1o heterozygous and homozygous mice and found a similar pattern of transcriptional up-regulation seen in the case of dnmt3l depleted oocytes. two independent experiments each performed in triplicate on two different pools of both heterozygous and homozygous oocytes showed that while dnmt3l transcript levels were not affected, the de novo dnmts, dnmt3a and dnmt3b, showed an increase in relative expression, with a roughly  <dig>  and  <dig> fold increase respectively in  <dig> dpp homozygous oocytes . dnmt3b was consistently up-regulated to a greater extent than dnmt3a at all time points and as a result of either dnmt1o or dnmt3l depletion. at  <dig> dpp, no reproducible change in dnmt3a, dnmt3b or dnmt3l expression levels were observed in dnmt1o null oocytes . we confirmed the purity of our germ cell preparations by determining dnmt1o expression levels in both heterozygote and homozygote dnmt1o deficient oocytes and found expression in the heterozygote oocytes to be roughly  <dig> times that seen in homozygote oocytes .

discussion & 
CONCLUSIONS
the establishment and maintenance of dna methylation patterns on imprinted genes and repeated sequences are essential for normal gametogenesis and embryogenesis in mammals. however, the developmental expression dynamics of the dnmt enzymes responsible for establishing and maintaining these dna methylation patterns are not well understood, particularly in female germ cells. in the present study, we used qrt-pcr to determine the expression profiles of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l in postnatal oocytes during the period when methylation patterns are being established. we also examined whether expression of these transcripts is related to oocyte diameter, investigated the transcript variants and protein isoforms of dnmt3a and dnmt3b found in growing oocytes, and determined the effect of depleting two dnmt enzymes, dnmt1o and dnmt3l, on the relative expression of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l. in addition to exploring the expression dynamics of the de novo enzymes in dnmt3l homozygous oocytes, we also investigated the methylation defects in these oocytes, with a particular interest in determining the effect of dnmt3l depletion on the methylation status of retrotransposons in female germ cells.

developmental profile of dnmt3a, dnmt3b, and dnmt3l during postnatal oocyte growth and comparison to their expression during spermatogenesis
several reports have provided some detail on the expression of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l in mouse oocytes. the staining of adult ovaries with x-gal to reveal the accumulation of a β-geo marker driven by the endogenous dnmt3l promoter showed dnmt3l to be accumulated in growing oocytes  <cit> . we have previously used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to determine the expression profile of these transcripts during postnatal female germ cell development and showed that they are expressed in growing oocytes  <cit> . qrt-pcr has been used to determine the expression patterns of these dnmts in the ovary, and while dnmt3a and dnmt3b expression appeared to be stable across the time points examined, dnmt3l expression clearly peaked post-natally  <cit> . still, because of the large population of somatic cells in the ovary, a more thorough assessment of the expression of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l in isolated female germ cells remained necessary to better understand the developmental profile of these dnmts during oogenesis. our results suggest that dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l have similar expression profiles, with their expression peaking during the crucial period in postnatal oocyte development when maternal methylation imprints are established  <cit> . analysis of the differences between the relative expression of the dnmts suggests that dnmt3l and dnmt3a are the most highly upregulated enzymes, consistent with their essential role and cooperation in establishing maternal methylation imprints  <cit> . the increased sensitivity offered by using qrt-pcr has allowed us to detect dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l transcripts in mii oocytes which we did not observe in our preliminary analysis  <cit> . this raises the possibility that these enzymes are stored as maternal transcripts and may play a role in de novo and/or maintenance methylation during preimplantation development.

in addition to studies focusing on female germ cells, the expression of these enzymes in mice has also been investigated during murine spermatogenesis. depletion of dnmt3a and dnmt3l in male germ cells leads to impaired spermatogenesis  <cit> . expression of dnmt3l appears to be confined to a brief perinatal period during which it is highly expressed in non-dividing spermatogonial stem cell precursors  <cit> . the testis-wide and germ cell specific expression of the dnmt <dig> transcripts has been examined using a qrt-pcr approach  <cit> . in the developing testis, dnmt3a and dnmt3l have similar expression profiles with expression peaking pre-natally at  <dig>  dpc, while dnmt3b expression peaks post-natally at  <dig> dpp  <cit> .

comparing the developmental expression profile of dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l in oocytes and the expression patterns previously described in the male germ line, sex-specific differences in the expression of this family of enzymes are apparent . the perinatal expression of both dnmt3a and dnmt3l in male germ cells fits well with the timing of methylation pattern establishment during spermatogenesis. both paternally methylated imprinted genes and repeat sequences begin to acquire methylation pre-natally in prospermatogonia and dna methylation patterns continue to be established and maintained peri-natally  <cit> . in contrast, dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l are expressed in postnatal growing oocytes during the period when maternally methylated imprinted genes and repeat elements acquire methylation  <cit> .

increased dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt3l and dnmt1o expression correlated with an increase in oocyte diameter
we have previously shown that methylation acquisition within the dmr of at least one imprinted gene is related to oocyte diameter  <cit> . hiura et al.   <cit>  and bao et al.   <cit>  also found that a certain threshold in oocyte diameter is necessary for epigenetic modifications to have been thoroughly established in oocytes. preliminary semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis suggested to us that the expression of dnmt3l may be influenced by oocyte diameter  <cit> . here, using a qrt-pcr approach we confirmed dnmt3l expression to be correlated to oocyte diameter and also found dnmt3a, dnmt3b as well as dnmt1o expression to significantly increase with increasing oocyte diameter. postnatal oogenesis is a period during which the oocyte grows greatly in volume and accumulates a variety of factors necessary for meiotic maturation and early preimplantation development  <cit> . the increase in transcription that accompanies this growth period also leads to elevated expression levels of dnmt3a, dnmt3b, dnmt3l and dnmt1o in fully grown oocytes.

aberrant methylation of snrpn, peg <dig>  and igf2r but normal methylation of iap and line- <dig> retrotransposons in growing dnmt3l-/- oocytes
it has been previously reported that depletion of dnmt3l in the oocyte results in impaired establishment of dna methylation patterns on imprinted genes inheriting a maternal methylation mark  <cit> . although abnormal methylation of the snrpn and peg <dig> dmrs was described in mature mii oocytes  <cit> , it remained unknown if different dmrs showed the same methylation defect and if this defect occurred early or late during female germ cell development. here, we analyzed the methylation profile of snrpn, igf2r, and peg <dig> in dnmt3l deficient mid-growing oocytes. we have previously observed methylation levels on these  <dig> genes at  <dig> dpp to be between  <dig> and 80%  <cit> . in keeping with the previously reported snrpn and peg <dig> results  <cit> , we found snrpn, peg <dig> and igf2r to be unmethylated in dnmt3l-/-  <dig> dpp oocytes, suggesting that dnmt3l is involved in the earliest stages of maternal methylation imprint acquisition.

in addition to analyzing imprinted gene methylation, we also examined the methylation status of the iap 5' ltr and the line- <dig> 5' utr in both growing and mature oocyte samples and found these retrotransposable elements to be normally methylated when compared to prior analysis of these same regions in oocytes  <cit> . while the methylation status of retrotransposons in dnmt3l homozygous oocytes was unknown, previous experiments suggested these sequences to be unaffected in post-implantation dnmt3l+/- embryos derived from the fertilization of dnmt3l deficient oocytes  <cit> . detailed studies have clearly shown that dnmt3l is required for establishing methylation on ltr and non-ltr retrotransposable elements in the male germ line and that this role for dnmt3l is important for ensuring normal meiosis  <cit> . in contrast, our analysis indicates that dnmt3l is not required for the establishment of methylation patterns on iaps or line-1s in oocytes. in contrast to sperm, iap and line- <dig> elements are not fully methylated in mature wild-type oocytes. this may be additional evidence of some different requirement of the two parental germ lines on methylation-dependent retrotransposon silencing. together, these observations suggest germ line specific functions for dnmt3l and demonstrate that its involvement in retrotransposon silencing is restricted to male germ cells. analysis of iap ltr methylation in dnmt3a depleted oocytes showed these repeats to be hypomethylated  <cit> . it remains possible that other factors together with dnmt3a are involved in retrotransposable elements methylation during oocyte development. interestingly, a recent report suggests the involvement of lsh, a member of the snf2-helicase family of chromatin remodellers, in retrotransposon silencing in female germ cells  <cit> .

up-regulation of the de novo dnmts in dnmt1o and dnmt3l depleted oocytes
in contrast to the dnmt3l knockout, where genomic imprints are not established  <cit> , depletion of dnmt1o does not affect the acquisition of genomic imprints  <cit> . to determine whether dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l are coordinately regulated or if they can compensate for each other, the expression profiles of these enzymes were compared between heterozygous and homozygous oocytes for both models. qrt-pcr results indicated that in response to dnmt1o depletion, the expression of the de novo dnmts, dnmt3a and dnmt3b, was up-regulated in  <dig> dpp gv oocytes, while dnmt3l, which lacks dna methyltransferase activity, showed no significant change. dnmt3a and dnmt3b were also up-regulated in the  <dig> dpp dnmt3l-/- oocytes analyzed. while the increase in dnmt3a expression was modest, dnmt3b expression was significantly upregulated in both dnmt1o and dnmt3l depleted oocytes with a parallel increase in protein expression observed in dnmt3l depleted  <dig> dpp oocytes. similarly, gius et al.   <cit>  also observed a three-fold increase in dnmt3b transcripts in a dnmt <dig> knockout cell line. these findings suggest that in the absence of one dnmt, a compensatory feedback mechanism may exist which leads to the up-regulation of dnmt3b in an attempt to rescue the defect in de novo and/or maintenance methylation.

it is possible that while such an upregulation may play a role in maintaining dna methylation on retrotransposons and other repeat sequences in the genome of dnmt3l-/- mice, it is unable to maintain methylation on imprinted sequences due to the absence of dnmt3l. the activation of retrotransposons in the male germ line has been shown to have deleterious consequences on meiosis  <cit> . iap transposons also appear to be resistant to active demethylation 'reprogramming' in primordial germ cells and zygotes  <cit> . in this report the authors speculate that maintaining these elements methylated may prevent their transposition and consequently avert the introduction of deleterious mutations in the genomes of gametes and preimplantation embryos. therefore, the upregulation of dnmts may be an additional mechanism which has evolved to ensure the silencing of these elements in the female germline. however, upregulation of a dnmt not normally expressed at high levels at a certain stage of oocyte development could potentially also have negative repercussions and contribute to aberrant methylation patterns in dnmt knock-out oocytes.

recent analysis of stochastic imprinting events in the progeny of dnmt3l-/- females showed that sporadically, in some embryos derived from dnmt3l null oocytes, maternal dmrs were methylated and imprinted expression was normal  <cit> . the authors suggest that in the absence of dnmt3l, the other dnmts or additional factors may act to rescue imprint establishment in the germline  <cit> . it is possible that the up-regulation of dnmt3b that we observed in dnmt3l-/- growing oocytes may contribute to this rescue. interestingly, for igf2r, one of the sequenced molecules was methylated at  <dig> of the  <dig> cpg sites analyzed . this observation may be reflective of the stochastic imprinting event also observed by arnaud et al. and may be a result of the rare instance where the upregulation of the other dnmts was able to rescue the methylation imprint. the overall failure of the dmrs to be methylated during oogenesis in dnmt3l-/- oocytes which are 'over-expressing' dnmt3b may be due to the inefficient targeting of the enzymes in the absence of dnmt3l. previous data have shown maternally imprinted genes in dnmt3l -/- mature mii oocytes to be unmethylated  <cit> . therefore an alternative possibility to reconcile the results presented here with those described by arnaud et al. is that in the absence of dnmt3l the dmrs acquire methylation during preimplantation development perhaps as a result of increased expression of dnmt3a and dnmt3b which are carried over as maternal transcripts.

prior studies have pointed to the interaction and interdependence of dnmt enzymes. in vitro studies have suggested that dnmt3l can stimulate de novo methylation catalyzed by dnmt3a at several ices  <cit> . physical interactions between dnmt3l and the c-terminal domain of both dnmt3a and dnmt3b, as well as interactions between dnmt <dig> and dnmt3a or dnmt3b have been described  <cit> . together with these studies, the qrt-pcr results described here suggest that dnmt3a, dnmt3b and dnmt3l are developmentally and may be coordinately regulated to ensure the proper methylation of both imprinted and non-imprinted sequences in the female germ line.
