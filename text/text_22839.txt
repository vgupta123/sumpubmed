BACKGROUND
bdellovibrios are gram-negative bacteria, which are characterized by predatory behavior and an obligatory parasitic life cycle  <cit> . bdellovibrios are largely found in wet, aerobic environments and were first isolated from soil in the early 1960's, where they are commonly encountered  <cit> . however, they can also be found in fresh and brackish water, sewage, and seawater  <cit> . another environmental niche in which bdellovibrios have been associated with are biofilms  <cit> . it is believed that biofilms provide optimal conditions for bdellovibrio survival as bdellovibrios can benefit from higher prey density, which is necessary for its survival  <cit> .

although the life cycle of bdellovibrio has been extensively investigated, very little is known about the mechanisms involved in predation and the genetic network regulating the developmental stages of bdellovibrio. in a recent study it was demonstrated that type iv pili play a role in bdellovibrio predation  <cit> . other mechanisms implicated in predation include motility and chemotaxis  <cit> .

one of the major difficulties hampering genetic manipulation in bdellovibrio is its prey dependency. thus, it may be difficult to introduce mutations in bdellovibrio genes that are directly involved in predation, without the potential risk of compromising the viability of the mutant cells. an important discovery made early in the study of bdellovibrio was that mutants that no longer require host cells for growth can be isolated  <cit> . these host-independent  or prey-independent mutants complete the transition from attack phase to growth phase and back again on standard complex bacteriological media. furthermore, these mutants retain their ability to grow on prey and are termed "facultative". though the genetic basis of the hi phenotype is not yet fully known  <cit> , hi bdellovibrio isolates are more amenable for genetic analysis than the host-dependent wild type, since individual mutant colonies can be isolated on plates and mutations that confer defects in predation do not necessarily prevent growth. thus, facultative hi bdellovibrio can facilitate acquisition and isolation of mutations in genes that are required for predation without compromising the viability of the mutant cells  <cit> .

in a previous study we showed that b. bacteriovorus 109j could attack and reduce existing escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens biofilms  <cit> . in this study we describe a new technique in which the facultative nature of the hi mutants is exploited in order to isolate genes that are required for predation of surface attached host cells. a b. bacteriovorus 109j hi transposon mutant library was generated using a mariner-based transposon delivery plasmid pbt <dig>  and the resulting transposon mutants were screened for their ability to reduce host cells grown as a biofilm. the transposon insertion site was mapped in selected mutants, and mutants were further characterized for their ability to attack surface attached host cells.

RESULTS
isolation of facultative hi mutants
using an hi enrichment protocol  <cit>  twenty-five hi mutants were isolated from six independent enrichment cultures. the selected hi colonies were evaluated by pcr, using 16s rrna primers that specifically target bdellovibrionaceae  <cit>  and primers that amplify the hit locus of b. bacteriovorus  <cit> . pcr reactions had confirmed that the selected hi colonies were derivatives of bdellovibrio . sequence analysis of the hit locus revealed no sequence deviation between b. bacteriovorus 109j wt strain and the hi-a variant, as was previously noted for other hi variants  <cit> . in order to assess the facultative behavior of the hi mutants and to demonstrate that the mutants retained their ability to attack surface attached and planktonicly grown host cells, three random hi mutants  were spotted on a lawn of host bacteria. after  <dig> hr, a clear lytic halo appeared at the point of inoculation . a lytic halo also appeared where the filtered b. bacteriovorus wild-type lysate  was spotted  but did not emerge where ddnb buffer alone  or heat killed hi-a mutant were inoculated . additionally, the effects of b. bacteriovorus hi mutants on e. coli biofilms were measured. e. coli biofilms  were formed in  <dig> well microtiter plates for ~ <dig> hrs. thereafter the medium was removed and the wells were washed with ddnb medium as described in the materials and methods. the e. coli biofilms were exposed for  <dig> hr to the hi mutants, b. bacteriovorus lysate or ddnb. as shown in fig. 1b , the untreated  <dig> hr-old biofilm was easily visualized with cv-staining. treatment with  <dig> ×  <dig> pfu of b. bacteriovorus  or  <dig> ×  <dig> cfu hi mutants  markedly reduced the cv-staining compared to the ddnb or heat killed hi-a control . quantification of the effect of b. bacteriovorus on e. coli biofilms over time revealed a 69% reduction in cv staining at  <dig> hr post-treatment and an 81% reduction after  <dig> hr , compared to the initial time point . a reduction of 63%, 55%, and 52% was observed following a  <dig> hr exposure period to hi mutants a, b, c, and a decrease of 70%, 62%, and 63% following  <dig> hr of incubation . in contrast, only a 22% and  <dig> % reduction in cv staining was measured after  <dig> hr in the control sample treated with ddnb and heat killed hi-a respectively . the ability of the hi mutants to reduce host cells grown planktonicly was also examined in standard induced lysates. all hi mutants, as well as b. bacteriovorus were able to reduce the planktonic population by ~ <dig> logs in the first  <dig> hr of predation with no reduction occurring when ddnb alone or hi heat killed mutant a was added .

construction of a b. bacteriovorus hi transposon mutant library, and isolation of mutants defective in biofilm predation
to isolate hi mutants defective in biofilm predation, a mariner-based transposon was used to mutagenize b. bacteriovorus hi. mutant hi colonies were placed into  <dig> flat-bottom  <dig> well dishes. for isolating hi mutants impaired in their ability to reduce surface attached bacteria, the hi transposon mutant library was grown in pye medium for  <dig> hr. thereafter, a 96-prong multi-well transfer device was used to transfer aliquots of mutant libraries into a preformed e. coli biofilm  that was developed in  <dig> well plates or on lawns of prey cells . using this approach  <dig> hi transposon mutants that were unable to reduce the preformed biofilms  were isolated. these mutants were termed biofilm predation mutants . no difference in growth rate was observed between bpm mutants and the hi recipient when grown in pye medium .

molecular characterization of biofilm predation mutants
in order to identify the gene disrupted in each of the mutants, the dna sequence flanking the insertion elements was determined for the first  <dig> of the  <dig> mutants isolated. typically, 200– <dig> bp of the dna sequence flanking the transposon insertions was obtained using the arbitrary pcr method . this dna sequence was compared with genbank using the blastx and blastn programs. the results from the analyses of  <dig> selected mutants are presented in table  <dig>  the mutants selected for further evaluation fall into three broad groups that were previously suggested to have a role in predation  <cit>  and therefore selected for additional study. the first group comprises strains with their mutation in genes required for flagella synthesis . the second group comprises of mutations in genes involved in pilus assembly . in a third class, the insertion element was mapped in a gene, which has a putative role in chemotaxis .

flagella, pilus and chemotaxis play a role in biofilm predation
it was previously demonstrated that swimming motility is required for the predatory lifecycle of b. bacteriovorus  <cit> . we have identified the b. bacteriovorus 109j homologues of two flge genes and a flgj gene, based on the degree of similarity of the predicted polypeptide encoded by the dna sequence flanking the insertion in the strain carrying allele bpm- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to the b. bacteriovorus hd  <dig> flge genes and flgj . both flge and flgj are thought to participate in flagellar hook and rod assembly  <cit> . when spotted on a lawn of host bacteria, bpm- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were unable to form lytic halos . furthermore no reduction of e. coli biofilm was detected following a  <dig> hr incubation period with the selected mutants . a reduction of  <dig> %, 14% and  <dig> % in cv staining was measured following a  <dig> hr incubation period with bpm- <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> respectively, compared to 70% decrease in the biofilms treated with the recipient hi-a .

another surface organelle that was recently shown to have a role in predation are pili  <cit> . here too we have isolated homologues of pilt, pilq, and piln , an insertion in a putative pilus assembly gene cluster , as well as two genes that, like pili, are thought to be required for gliding motility . the ability of bpm- <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> to form lytic halos on lawns of host cells and to reduce an existing e. coli biofilm was greatly impaired compared to the hi recipient strain , with only a  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % reduction in biofilm staining for each of the mutants . in contrast, bpm- <dig> and  <dig> did show an ability to form lytic halos and reduce the pre-formed biofilm by  <dig> % and  <dig> % ; however, the biofilm reduction brought about by mutants bpm- <dig> and  <dig> was still significantly less than the biofilm reduction caused by b. bacteriovorus wt treatment . bpm- <dig> in which the insertion element was mapped to a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein was also incapable of forming lytic halos on lawns of host cells  as well as being extremely weakened in its ability to reduce a pre-formed biofilm, with a reduction of  <dig> % after a  <dig> hr incubation period .

during the biofilm reduction screen,  <dig> biofilm reduction mutants out of  <dig>  hi transposon mutants  were isolated, thus the majority of the mutants did not seem to be impaired in their ability to prey on biofilms. to further verify that the decrease in the hi ability to reduce a biofilm was not caused by the transposon element, we have randomly picked two hi transposon mutants for additional evaluation and quantification of their ability to reduce biofilms. as seen in fig 3a–c  the hi randomly selected transposon mutants were able to form lytic halos as well as reduce the pre-formed biofilm to a similar or higher degree as the hi-a recipient which did not harbor the transposon.

discussion
for years most of what has been learned about bdellovibrio biology and development has come from biochemical, physiological and observational studies  <cit> . the availability of new molecular tools  <cit>  and the recent genome sequence of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig>  <cit>  improved our ability to study the biology of this unique microorganism. despite the recent developments in bdellovibrio research, many questions regarding the mechanisms involved in host-predator interaction still remain unclear. in an attempt to gain better insight into these issues, we have utilized the facultative predatory characteristics of b. bacteriovorus hi mutants and transposon mutagenesis, to produce a b. bacteriovorus hi random mutant library that could be screened for isolates that are unable to prey on host cells grown as a biofilm.

using previously described enrichment protocol  <cit>  numerous hi mutants were isolated from independent enrichment cultures. specific primers for targeting b. bacteriovorus and bdellovibrionaceae  <cit>  were used in a pcr reaction, verifying the selected colonies as being derivatives of bdellovibrio. when grown in the presence of host cells, all of the isolated hi mutants were able to form plaques in double-layered agar plates . further evaluation of three randomly selected hi mutants  confirmed that the hi mutants retained their parasitic capacities and were able to prey on host cells . the facultative predatory behavior of hi mutants is a well-established and documented phenomenon  <cit> . hi mutants were previously utilized to examine the role played by type iv pili, flagella  <cit>  and the significance of the hit locus  on predation  <cit> .

in order to isolate genes that might have a role in host-prey interaction we have employed a mariner-based transposon delivery system, previously applied to other bacteria  <cit> , to randomly mutagenize a b. bacteriovorus hi isolate. this is the first time to our knowledge that random in-vivo transposon mutagenesis of bdellovibrio has been demonstrated. in this study we have focused our efforts on screening and isolating genes that impact the ability of the predator to prey upon surface attached host cells. the ability of bdellovibrio to prey on biofilms is considered to be of ecological importance, as it was proposed that biofilms can serve as a natural reservoir for bdellovibrio in nature  <cit> . working with pre-formed biofilms developed in static microtiter plates and flow cell systems, we have previously demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus does have the ability to penetrate and reduce biofilms, and the action of this predator is not restricted to the surface of the biofilm; moreover, it was apparent that the predator not only survived in biofilms, but could feed, proliferate and escape in order to start a new cycle of predation  <cit> .

out of the ~ <dig>  hi transposon mutants that were screened we have identified  <dig> isolates that were reduced in their ability to prey on surface attached host cells, which we termed biofilm predation mutants . an arbitrary pcr method was used to determine the dna sequence flanking the insertion elements of the first randomly selected  <dig> mutants. for this study and as a proof of principle demonstrating the aptitude of the system, we have selected  <dig> mutants in whom the disrupted genes fall into three broad groups, which were previously suggested to have a role in predation: flagella, pili and chemotaxis. out of the ~ <dig>  transposon mutants examined, 99% did not display any reduction in their ability to reduce biofilms. to verify that the transposon element does not alter the predation ability of hi mutant when inserted in what seems to be non-essential predation genes, we have randomly selected two hi transposon mutants in whom the insertion was mapped to genes with high sequence identity to a b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> putative histidine kinase  and a putative antimicrobial peptide transport  . as was demonstrated  no drop in biofilm predation was observed for these random mutants, compared to the hi-a recipient strain.

since attack-phase bdellovibrio are highly motile, it is possible that motility may be critical for the survival of the predator in its natural habitat. furthermore, it was suggested that motility might be essential to generate the forces required for attachment and penetration of the prey. in  <dig>  koval and colleagues inhibited the flagellar motor by expression of antisense rna complementary to the motab transcript. in their work they demonstrated that b. bacteriovorus conjugated with the motab antisense expression construct were markedly impaired in their ability to escape from the bdelloplast, and that a functional mota is required in the predator lifecycle of bdellovibrio  <cit> . in another study a flic mutant of b. bacteriovorus was constructed. it was shown that the flagellin gene  could be successfully inactivated only in hi mutants. in predation experiments the motility minus hi bdellovibrio flic <dig> mutant did have a certain ability to enter the periplasm of their prey, but failed to lyse prey and showed only a partial ability to form clearing of soft agar overly containing e. coli prey  <cit> .

three flagellum hi mutants incapable of reducing surface attached host cells were isolated . in two of the mutants  the disrupted genes had a 99% identity to b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> flge genes  or the flagellar hook protein  <cit> . the third mutation  was mapped to a gene exhibiting a 96% identity to the flagellar protein flgj of hd <dig> strain  which was also shown to be essential for hook assembly and a functional flagellum  <cit> . biofilms are commonly composed of bacterial cells embedded in thick extracellular polymer substances , which can provide protection against various environmental factors  <cit>  as well as act as a barrier that can limit the ability of invertebrates, protozoan and bacteriophage to penetrate and access the cells within the biofilm  <cit> . nonetheless, biofilm eps and cell thickness does not seem to obstruct b. bacteriovorus biofilm predation, as it was demonstrated that the predator was able to significantly reduce "mature" biofilms grown in flow cell systems  <cit> . thus, motility likely has a significant role in providing the predator with the mechanical force required to "break" through the dense biofilm biomass.

the second group of hi mutants isolated had transposon elements inserted in genes that are similar to genes with a known role in pilus assembly or function. type iv pili in bacterial species are well characterized and have been shown to be involved in functions including host cell adherence, invasion, twitching, and fruiting body formation  <cit> . it was proposed that bdellovibrio might use pili as a mechanism of entering the prey cell. at least four clusters of pil genes were found on the chromosome of b. bacteriovorus hd <dig>  as were numerous dispersed pil genes coding for type iv pili  <cit> . in a recent study it was established that the interruption of pila gene, encoding the type iv pilus fiber protein, in b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> hi mutants, abolished the hi predatory capability in liquid prey cultures and on immobilized prey, leading to the conclusion that pili are essential and play a critical role in bdellovibrio predation  <cit> . the transposon insertions in bpm- <dig> and  <dig> were found to be in two genes that have high similarity to putative b. bacteriovorus hd <dig> pilus assembly protein pilt  and piln . bpm- <dig> was similar  to the hd <dig> pilq gene , which is involved in forming a functional channel or outer membrane pore through which the pilus is extruded or retracted  <cit> .

like bpm- <dig>  bpm- <dig>  which had close similarity to the hd <dig> putative protein bd <dig>  was found to lie closely to the prey interaction  locus. the hit locus was previously identified and attributed to the hi phenotype  <cit> . although no function could be assigned to any orf at this locus, hit seems to be a part of a transcriptional unit together with a gene coding for a cell wall-associated protein with a cellulose-binding domain , the flagellar pilus assembly genes tada  and tadb , and additional pil genes that encode structural elements of a type iv pilus. as type iv pili are known to have a function in twitching motility  <cit> , adventurous gliding is also believed to provide a means for microbes to travel in environments with a low water content, such as might be found in biofilms, microbial mats, and soil  <cit> , as well as aiding in host cell infection in some apicomplexan parasites  <cit> . we have found that a putative disruption in the aglr gene bd <dig>  or in a putative protein located in adjoining gliding motility cluster bd <dig> , lessen the ability of the predator to reduce thick biofilms developed on  <dig> well plates, but did not seem to have an effect when spotted on prey lawns, as it was shown that both mutants had the capacity to form halos on thin lawns of host cells . this result suggests that gliding might indeed be involved in motility within the biofilm in which cell density and eps can affect other propelling mechanisms such as swimming.

like flagella and pili, chemotaxis was also proposed to play a role in predation. studies have confirmed that b. bacteriovorus does have a chemotactic response towards amino acids and high concentration of prey cells  <cit> . disruption of the mcp <dig> gene, encoding a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein, and an mvin homolog, did not eliminate predation but did give rise to b. bacteriovorus mutants that were less efficient in predators suggesting that chemotaxis plays a role in directing bdellovibrio towards its prey  <cit> . in bpm- <dig> the mutation insertion was mapped to a gene exhibiting a 90% identity to the mcp methyl chemotaxis protein of b. bacteriovorus . like the flagella and pili mutants, described above, the mcp putative mutant was also greatly deficient in its ability to attack surface attached bacteria , suggesting that chemotaxis might play a role in directing the predator towards the prey within the tightly packed biofilm mass.

CONCLUSIONS
our results demonstrate that motility systems are required for predation of bacterial biofilms. we are currently focusing our efforts on evaluating the role of other factors that were singled out through our study. we believe that the methods developed here coupled with the genetic tools already available, should allow to broaden our understanding of factors important for host-predator interactions as well as the biology of this unique organism.
