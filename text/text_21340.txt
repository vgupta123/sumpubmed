BACKGROUND
plants show a high level of plasticity and adapt to changing environmental conditions by extensive modifications in developmental programmes. a striking example concerns the plant's capacity to implement cell pluripotency and totipotency programmes  <cit> . in pluripotency, a single cell gives rise to most, but not all, of the various cell types that make up a plant. in totipotency, a single cell can develop into an embryo , thereby producing a new adult organism. during both of these programmes, a single differentiated somatic cell re-enters the cell cycle via the cell-reactivation process. cell reactivation proceeds in two phases  <cit> . some cells, dispersed within the mesophyll tissue of in vitro plantlets seem particularly responsive when induced in an appropriate culture medium. once induced, these cells - referred to as 'competent' cells - become committed to different morphogenetic pathways such as organogenesis and callogenesis  or somatic embryogenesis . however, not all competent cells are able to re-enter the cell cycle and undergo cellular division  and are referred to as 'reactivating cells' . in contrast, if competent cells are able to undergo mitosis they are referred to as 'fully reactivated cells' .

in the context of our research into plant cell reactivation in chicory, we had previously used the interspecific hybrid '474'   <cit> . in this model, somatic embryos can develop rapidly, in high numbers, and directly from single reactivated cells of different vegetative or reproductive explants   <cit> . previous studies have shown that the cell reactivation process takes place between d <dig> and d <dig> in in vitro cultures of the hybrid '474'  <cit> . unfortunately, the interspecific hybrid '474' is unsuitable for genetic analyses because of its sterility, and two new experimental genotypes were, therefore, selected: i) a responsive genotype was identified as highly embryogenic in a hybrid population of the hungarian cultivar koospol  and labelled k <dig> and ii) a non-responsive genotype, labelled c <dig>  was identified as nonembryogenic among the descendants produced by repeated selfing of the k <dig> genotype  <cit> .

the generation of subtractive cdna libraries  and sequencing of ests enabled our laboratory to obtain preliminary molecular information concerning differences in gene expression between the two genotypes  <cit> . this study showed that several genes were differentially expressed between the  <dig> genotypes during somatic embryogenesis and that a gene, encoding a potential arabinogalactan protein  , was significantly over-expressed in the embryogenic k <dig> genotype as compared to the non-embryogenic genotype c <dig>  such an observation is interesting as we had previously shown that the β-d  <dig>  glucosyl yariv reagent  that specifically binds agps blocked somatic embryo production in chicory root explants  <cit> . these two results could suggest that agps are involved in cell reactivation in chicory. agps are a class of cell wall proteoglycans usually containing a hydroxyproline-rich core protein backbone linked to a very large carbohydrate moiety representing 90-98% of the molecular mass  <cit> . agps are widely distributed in higher plants  <cit>  where they are believed to play multiple roles in vegetative-, reproductive-, and cellular-growth and development  <cit> . agps have also been associated with the cell re-differentiation process in both carrot and chicory  <cit> .

β-glc y is a synthetic molecule that specifically interacts with agps in a non-covalent manner  <cit>  and has been used to selectively precipitate agps in muro thereby interfering with their functional activity  <cit> . the use of β-glc y has been shown to inhibit cell growth  <cit> , to alter cell elongation in arabidopsis roots  <cit> , to modify programmed cell death and differentiation  <cit> , to inhibit pollen tube growth  <cit> , and to inhibit both se  <cit>  and zygotic embryo development  <cit> .

in this study we used  <dig> different genotypes  together with β-glc y-treatment in an original approach to discriminate cell reactivation from in vitro morphogenesis and to analyse cell events during se induction in chicory. transcriptomic analyses were performed on probes  pre-selected by ssh. microarrays representing  <dig>  unique genes were used to investigate the expression profiles of the two chicory genotypes in the presence and absence of β-glc y.

RESULTS
 <dig>  cytological characterization of cell reactivation  events in chicory
the k <dig> but not c <dig> genotype shows complete cell reactivation  and somatic embryogenesis  in cultured leaves
we have previously reported preliminary cytological studies on cell reactivation in k <dig> and c <dig> chicory explants from greenhouse-grown plants  <cit> . here, we present detailed cytological analyses of the two phases that occur during cell reactivation in explants obtained from in vitro-grown plantlets of these  <dig> genotypes .

the first phase of cell reactivation involved several stages of cell reorganisation. at d <dig>  leaves from 6-week old plantlets  contained 5- <dig> layers of differentiated spongy mesophyll tissue but no palisade mesophyll bordered by a thin epidermis . differentiated mesophyll cells were rectangular and characterized by the presence of a thin cell wall lined with a layer of cytoplasm, a turgid single vacuole and a small nucleus . in addition, numerous chloroplasts  were observed adjacent to the cell wall. these chloroplasts were flattened and stained strongly with tbo suggesting the presence of high amounts of proteins. observation of day  <dig> explants revealed that a small proportion of cells had started to undergo structural reorganisations associated with the first phase of cell reactivation . this first phase can be divided into  <dig> stages . the first stage  involved modifications to the nucleus that became more spherical and was therefore more easily distinguished in a section plane. in addition, a small nucleolus also appeared .

the next stage  was characterised by a large increase in nuclear volume, as well as by important modifications in the structure and distribution of other cellular components . chloroplasts became more spherical and stained less strongly with tbo. these organelles were located near to the cell wall  and were also observed next to the nucleus . in some cases plastids formed a perinuclear crown. in conclusion, this first cell reactivation phase occurs in both k <dig> and c <dig> genotypes and is characterised by an important reorganisation in cellular structure with significant increases in both nuclear-  and nucleolar- volumes  as compared to d <dig> explants. cells in this first phase of cell reactivation are considered as reactivating cells .

further examination revealed that only the responsive genotype k <dig> was capable of undergoing the second phase of cell reactivation . in this phase, chloroplasts are absent or, if present, have become disorganised and some organelles appeared to be fused together. the centrally-positioned nucleus increased in volume  and contained a large unique, , nucleolus. cytoplasmic strands became associated with the nucleus and the vacuole fragmented. the second cell reactivation phase is therefore characterised by profound modifications to the structure of organelles and different cell compartments, together with increases in both nuclear-  and nucleolar-  volumes as compared to the first cell reactivation phase. our results also showed that second phase reactivated cells are able to re-enter the cell-cycle and divide  via a segmentation pathway and can therefore be considered as fully reactivated cells  according to the definition of verdeil et al.  <cit> . daughter-cells first appeared within the original volume of the frc and gave rise to a multi-cellular somatic embryo .

these results demonstrate that k <dig> and c <dig> genotypes show important differences in their capacity to undergo cell reactivation. while k <dig> is able to complete the  <dig> cell reactivation phases, c <dig> cells remain blocked in the first phase. in the latter genotype, no frcs are formed, and mitoses and multi-cellular structures are absent at d <dig> 

somatic embryogenesis  but not cell reactivation  is blocked in the k <dig> genotype by β-glc y
we had previously demonstrated that se in chicory roots was blocked by treatment with β-glc y suggesting that this reagent represents a useful tool for investigating se in this species. in order to see whether β-glc y also blocked se in the k <dig> embryogenic genotype we cultured leaf explants for  <dig> days in se induction medium containing β-glc y . control samples  were cultured for  <dig> days in se medium with no β-glc y. the appearance of k <dig> leaf explants cultured for  <dig> days in the absence of β-glc y  is shown in fig. 2b. at this stage explants appeared as curled-up green fragments  and somatic embryos could be observed as white structures on the cut borders. closer examination  indicated that different embryo developmental stages  could be identified. in contrast, k <dig> genotype leaf explants cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of β-glc y  do not produce somatic embryos . in these explants β-glc y was visible as red dots within the leaf blade. these results clearly indicate that β-glc y is able to block se in the k <dig> genotype.

in order to see whether β-glc y inhibition of se is permanent we cultured explants for  <dig> days in se induction medium containing β-glc y, followed by transfer to medium lacking β-glc y for a further  <dig> days . our results  show that at  <dig> days the red dots  had disappeared and that somatic embryos were visible. further observations  indicated that the embryos appeared very rapidly,  following transfer to medium lacking β-glc y. these results indicate that β-glc y inhibition of se is reversible in the k <dig> genotype. identical treatments with the c <dig> genotype  confirmed that this genotype is not capable of producing somatic embryos in the conditions examined.

taken together, these results confirmed 1) that the k <dig> genotype, but not the c <dig> genotype, was responsive  when leaf explants were cultured in se induction medium and 2) that the 11-day β-glc y-treatment blocked the in vitro morphogenetic development in the k <dig> chicory genotype. our results also show that the inhibitory effect of β-glc y on se in k <dig> leaf explants is not permanent and can be rapidly reversed as was previously observed in root explants of the chicory hybrid '474'  <cit> . interestingly, reversible inhibition by β-glc y has also been reported in the case of pollen tube growth in several species  <cit> , as well as in zygotic embryo differentiation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

our results indicated that se in the k <dig> genotype was reversibly blocked by β-glc y. in order to see whether this inhibition concerned cell reactivation and/or the subsequent morphogenetic pathway we analyzed sections of leaf explants cultured for  <dig> days in se induction medium containing β-glc y. our results  showed that although β-glc y had a significant effect on cell reactivation , it did not completely block this process in the k <dig> genotype. since no somatic embryos can be observed in explants cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of β-glc y, this would suggest that the main inhibitory effect of this reagent acts on the morphogenetic pathway following cell reactivation. the observation  that embryos are rapidly formed following β-glc y removal could suggest that cells remain blocked at the frc stage thereby allowing rapid morphogenetic development once the inhibitor is eliminated. similar analyses of c <dig> genotype explants indicated that only rcs were present in both the presence and absence of β-glc y .

se inhibition by β-glc y is potentially associated with cell wall modifications
observations of sections from leaf explants  cultured for  <dig> days in the presence of β-glc y indicated that the yariv reagent was present as an orange coloration surrounding certain mesophyll cells . no coloration was observed inside these cells. such an observation is logical since the β-glc y molecule is small enough to penetrate the intercellular space of plant tissues, but too large to cross the plasma membrane  <cit> . since β-glc y is known to interact with agps  <cit>  our results could suggest that β-glc y co-localised with cell wall agps.

visual inspection of mesophyll cell walls coloured orange by β-glc y suggested that they were thicker than the walls of neighbouring mesophyll cells not coloured by β-glc y . interestingly, such cell wall thickening in the presence of β-glc y was also observed during cell reactivation in the chicory '474' hybrid  <cit> . in this case, further studies  <cit>  indicated that callose was deposited around frcs. these results could suggest that the β-glc y reagent modifies cell wall assembly in chicory, possibly by preventing the incorporation of secreted material into the cell wall as previously observed in lilly  <cit> . in this species, β-glc y binds to agps and destabilizes cell wall assembly by blocking the deposition of pectin material in the cell wall. in addition, the periplasmic space expands as a result of the accumulation of vesicles containing agps and pectins, and synthesis of callose is simultaneously induced. a direct link between agps and pectin has also been previously observed in carrot  <cit>  where it has been shown that cell wall agps may be covalently linked to pectin containing a homogalacturonan structural element.

 <dig>  transcriptome profiling during cell reactivation in chicory
transcriptome profiling identifies genes differentially regulated between embryogenic and non-embryogenic genotypes
our detailed microscopic analyses had shown that while both k <dig> and c <dig> genotypes undergo the first phase of cell reactivation, only k <dig> undergoes the second phase, followed by the formation of somatic embryos. in order to learn more about the molecular bases of these biological processes we performed transcriptome profiling using chicory specific microarrays corresponding to  <dig>  genes previously identified in a chicory ssh library  <cit> .

in a first experiment we compared the expression profiles of d <dig> leaf explants under se induction conditions versus d <dig> for both genotypes. expression profiles are represented as a venn diagram in fig.  <dig> . seventy-five  out of the  <dig>  genes analysed were found specifically or differentially expressed in e,  <dig>  genes were found specifically regulated in ne, and  <dig> genes were similarly regulated in both e and ne genotypes. these results suggest that the  <dig>  genes specifically or differentially regulated in the k <dig> and c <dig> genotypes during in vitro induction of se could be involved in the different cell fate and se pathways taken by these  <dig> genotypes. it is possible that the group of  <dig> genes regulated similarly in both genotypes might represent a common stress response to the induction culture conditions and/or these genes might be involved in the cell reactivation process common to both genotypes.

transcriptome profiling and β-glc y-treatment identifies genes potentially involved in the se morphogenetic pathway
our cytological analyses  indicated that β-glc y-treatment inhibits the morphogenetic pathway leading to somatic embryo formation but has little effect on the cell reactivation process. the yariv reagent therefore represents a useful tool to separate cell reactivation events from the se pathway. in order to specifically identify genes potentially involved in these different processes we performed transcriptome profiling on both k <dig> and c <dig> leaf explants cultured for  <dig> days in the presence/absence of β-glc y . an initial examination of our results had shown that the expression profiles of d <dig> k59- and c15-explants did not show any significant differences , thereby allowing a direct comparison of the results obtained separately  for both genotypes.

our results  indicate that only relatively few genes  show changes in gene expression in the presence of β-glc y. of these  <dig> genes,  <dig>  genes were both differentially expressed between k <dig> and c <dig> during se induction and affected by β-glc y-treatment. these results suggest that these genes could be involved in the morphogenetic pathway leading to somatic embryo formation in chicory. among the  <dig> genes,  <dig> encode cell wall proteins: arabinogalactan-protein , and remorin . the other  <dig> genes are not directly related to the cell wall-compartment and include  <dig> s proteasome aaa atpase subunit  <dig> , non-specific lipid transfer proteins , metallothionein- <dig> , hmg-coa reductase , and snakin  <dig>  .

the gene encoding the peptide core of a putative agp  was differentially expressed in k <dig>  and c <dig>  genotypes during se induction, and repressed  by β-glc y-treatment . such an observation is in agreement with our previous results in chicory  <cit> , as well as affymetrix transcriptome analyses in arabidopsis cells  <cit>  showing that the expression levels of  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes encoding an agp core polypeptide were modified by β-glc y treatment. in arabidopsis cells, no agp gene was induced more than 2-fold following  <dig> h β-glc y-treatment but several agps were down-regulated more than 2-fold. these results, together with the observations  <cit>  that agps are associated with the cell re-differentiation process in both carrot and chicory provide strong support for the role of the putative agp  in chicory se. only one agp-like gene  was represented on our microarray design since it was the only one whose differential expression was confirmed by q-rt-pcr  <cit> . nevertheless, it would obviously be interesting to investigate the effect of β-glc y-treatment on the expression of other chicory agp genes.

our results  also showed that a second 'cell wall gene' rem, a remorin encoding gene , was specifically up-regulated during se induction in k <dig> cells, but not in c <dig> cells. the gene was also down-regulated by β-glc y treatment in both genotypes. remorins were first discovered in a screen for plasma membrane proteins differentially phosphorylated in the presence of oligogalacturonides  <cit>  and were recently reviewed  <cit> . the observation that a chicory rem  was down-regulated by β-glc y could be related to the fact that such treatment immobilises oligogalacturonic acids  and polygalacturonic acids  in the periplasmic space  <cit> . our results showed that both rem  and agp  were up-regulated in the k <dig> genotype during se induction. these observations suggest that cell wall reorganization could play an important role in se, with agp potentially contributing to the transport of pectin-like material  <cit>  or covalent linkages  <cit> , and remorin being involved in oga-/pga-binding and signalling  <cit> . interestingly, we have previously shown that se in chicory involves a complete re-organisation of cell wall architecture and pectin modifications  <cit> .

of the other 'non-cell wall genes' potentially involved in se, rpt <dig> encoding the regulatory aaa atpase subunit  <dig> of the  <dig> s proteasome, was up-regulated during the induction phase in k <dig>  but not c <dig> . β-glc y-treatment considerably down-regulated rpt6-expression in both genotypes. the proteasome pathway is one of the most elaborate regulatory mechanisms in plants  <cit>  and has been shown to be involved in plant development. for example mg <dig>  a specific inhibitor of the  <dig> s proteasome, interferes with the entry of plant cells into the s phase of the cell cycle  <cit>  as well as the passage g2/metaphase in yeast  <cit> . the observation that rpt6-expression is genotype-dependant and modified by β-glc y-treatment in chicory could suggest that the responsiveness to the induction of in vitro morphogenesis might be proteasome-mediated. in this case, it is possible that rpt <dig> could influence the transition from rc to frc status and, consequently, cell fate determination in chicory explants.

our results  also showed that two genes encoding nsltps  were differentially expressed between k <dig> and c <dig> during se induction. β-glcy-treatment down-regulated the expression of these  <dig> genes in both genotypes. the first gene  shares sequence homology with sdi- <dig> from helianthus annuus and the second gene  shares sequence homology with dea <dig> from lycopersicon esculentum. the presence of nsltps during se has previously been reported in other species such as grapevine  <cit>  and carrot  <cit> . in the latter species, it was shown  <cit>  that nsltp gene expression followed, rather than preceded se. interestingly, we have previously shown  <cit>  that a 9-kda acidic nsltp-like protein was secreted by the embryogenic cells of roots in the chicory interspecific hybrid '474' and that se in chicory is also associated with increases in phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerols thereby suggesting that changes in lipid and fatty acid composition might be involved in this process  <cit> .

another gene, metallothionein- <dig>  was down-regulated in k <dig> but not c <dig> during in vitro induction, and up-regulated in both genotypes by β-glcy . the described role of metallothioneins is to bind metals and these proteins are therefore involved in plant responses to salinity and oxidative stress  <cit> . alterations in the cellular redox status have been shown to be associated with in vitro se  <cit> . in chicory, glutathione s-tranferases  that belong to a complex anti-oxidant mechanism within the cell, together with catalase  and mt <dig>  were found to be more abundant or exclusively present in a non-embryogenic subtractive library  <cit> . such an observation could suggest that 'low' levels of oxidative stress are associated with a non-embryogenic status in chicory and that 'higher' levels are associated with se events. the fact that mt <dig> was down-regulated in k <dig> during se induction is in agreement with this hypothesis. in this case it is possible that the up-regulation of mt <dig> observed during β-glcy-treatment not only protects the cells against oxidative stress, but also modifies the cellular redox status thereby impeding se formation.

finally, two other genes with a less evident role in se events were also differentially regulated between the two genotypes during se induction. 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coa reductase  encodes an enzyme in the mevalonate pathway  <cit>  and our results  showed that the corresponding chicory gene  was down-regulated in the embryogenic genotype k <dig> during in vitro induction. such an observation is interesting since we had previously shown that the corresponding transcript was abundant in a non-embryogenic subtractive library  <cit> . the fact that β-glc y-treatment up-regulated the hmg-coa reductase gene in both chicory genotypes also suggests that the expression of this gene is negatively correlated with se. the last differentially-regulated gene snakin  <dig>  is putatively involved in developmental regulation processes and in defence  <cit> . our results  showed that the gene  was up-regulated in c <dig>  but not k <dig>  during in vitro se induction. β-glc y-treatment down-regulated sn <dig> gene expression in both genotypes.

β-glc y-treatment affects the expression profiles of genes not involved in se
our results showed that β-glc y-treatment modified the expression profiles of  <dig> genes not involved in se . these genes encode polygalacturonase inhibiting protein , extracellular dermal glycoprotein precursor , protease inhibitor ,  <dig> s proteasome alpha subunit b , protein kinase family protein , adp ribosylation factor gtpase activating protein , lateral organ boundaries domain protein  <dig> , peroxidase , quinone reductase , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , and serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor .

the observed modifications in the expression profiles of these genes can be most likely interpreted as a direct or indirect response of plant cells to β-glc y independent of se-related events. for example, pgip  is a secreted protein involved in plant defence at the cell wall  <cit>  where it is believed to modulate the activities of fungal polygalacturonases targeting cell wall pectins  <cit> . in lilly, β-glc y has been shown  <cit>  to block pectin-containing vesicules in the periplasmic space and it is therefore possible that the exposure of explants to this reagent interferes with correct cell wall assembly thereby provoking a defence response involving pgip gene up-regulation. similarly, a chicory homologue  of arabidopsis agd <dig>  an adp-ribosylation factor gtpase activating protein  was up-regulated during β-glc y-treatment . arabidopsis contains  <dig> proteins with arfgap domains termed agd proteins  <cit> . the gtp-bound form of arf is essential for the maintenance of normal golgi morphology  <cit>  and correct cell wall assembly  <cit> . it is therefore possible that β-glc y interferes with correct cell wall assembly thereby provoking modifications in a gene  involved in this process.

β-glc y treatment mimics wound- and pathogenic-like effects
previous studies  <cit>  have shown that β-glc y-treatment induces a wound response in arabidopsis cells including modifications in gene expression. similarly, comparative studies of wound and stress signalling  <cit>  have revealed the existence of extensive cross-talk in arabidopsis and other species. interestingly, a number of reported mimetic effects between the response to β-glc y and the responses to wounding and pathogen attack in chicory have also been reported  <cit> . examination of our results  showed that, of the  <dig> genes whose expression was modified by β-glc y,  <dig> also showed similar modifications to wounding or pathogen treatment. such an observation suggests that β-glc y-treatment in chicory mimics a wounding-/pathogen-response. in other plants, β-glc y-treatment has been shown to induce different effects depending upon the explant type, culture medium and species. for example, in rose cell suspension cultures, a 7-day β-glc y-treatment did not lead to a loss of viability  <cit> , whereas in arabidopsis cells, β-glc y-treatment led to loss of viability, and programmed cell death  <cit> . in chicory, we did not observe any necrosis or collapsed cells in either macroscopic or microscopic leaf samples suggesting that the 'wounding' effect of β-glc y-treatment in our system remains relatively mild despite the modifications observed in 'defence' gene expression profiles.

CONCLUSIONS
the two analysed chicory genotypes differed in their morphogenetic capacities. the c <dig> unresponsive  genotype was able to enter the first phase of cell reactivation, but not the second phase, and was therefore unable to express any morphogenetic pathway. in contrast, the k <dig> responsive  genotype was able to enter both the first and second phases of cell reactivation and was therefore able to undergo se. β-glc y had little effect on the first phase of cell reactivation but proved to be a successful tool to reversibly block se in the k <dig> genotype. the use of this reagent together with transcriptome profiling allowed us to identify  <dig> genes that are potentially involved in the second phase of cell reactivation and/or se in chicory explants. two  of the  <dig> genes were associated with cell wall activities underlying the importance of this cellular compartment in developmental processes. overall, this study allowed us to obtain a detailed description of cell reactivation events in chicory at the cellular and transcriptomic levels and to identify key genes potentially involved in this complex process.
