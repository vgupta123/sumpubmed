BACKGROUND
fibronectin  is a glycoprotein composed of two nearly identical ~ <dig> kda subunits linked covalently near their c termini by a pair of disulfide bonds  <cit> . each subunit is a mosaic of a series of repeating modules:  <dig> type i,  <dig> type ii,  <dig> to  <dig>  type iii modules, and a variable  sequence that is not homologous to other parts of fn. the  <dig> type iii modules called extradomain a  and extradomain b  are subject to alternative splicing  <cit> . on the basis of its solubility, fn is subdivided into two forms: soluble plasma fn and less-soluble cellular fn  <cit> . plasma fn that is synthesized in hepatocytes contains neither eda nor edb whereas cellular fn  contains variable amounts of either or both eda and edb. in plasma fn dimers, only one of the subunits contains the v region, whereas almost all cellular fn subunits contain this region  <cit> . plasma fn is an abundant soluble constituent in plasma with a concentration about  <dig> μg/ml  <cit> ; and cellular fn is an extracellular matrix that provides the architectural scaffolding in tissues  <cit> .

fn is a multifunctional molecule involving many physiological and pathological processes such as infections with different viruses  <cit> , cellular adhesion, embryogenesis, tissue damage and repair  <cit> , atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction  <cit>  and tumor therapy  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that fn is involved in the virus infection, including rabies virus  <cit> , human immunodeficiency virus   <cit> , cytomegalovirus  <cit> , rous sarcoma virus   <cit>  and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus  <cit> . recently, the interaction of hepatitis b virus  with fn has been investigated by several laboratories and their results have clarified that fn is related to hbv infection  <cit> .

hbv infection is a worldwide public health problem, especially in the eastern countries. globally, more than  <dig> million people are infected by hbv and 10~25% of them die of either liver cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit> . preventing the evolvement from transient hbv infection into chronic hbv, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, human beings are encountering tremendous challenge. there are several therapeutic agents including interferon-α , peglyated ifn  and four oral nucleotide analogues  currently approved for the treatment of chronic hbv  <cit> . but there are no proteases as drugs in the therapeutic agents.

previous studies have shown that fn is involved in hbv infection, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. budkowska and colleagues  <cit>  have found that fn of human liver sinusoids is able to bind to hbv via the pre-s <dig> domain. this in vivo interaction of hbv with liver fn may play a role in the initial steps of virus's entry into the target cells, subsequently mediating by specific hepatocyte receptors. fn expression increases markedly in sinusoidal endothelial cells, and the matrixes deposit by these cells stimulate the conversion of liver lipocytes to myofibroblasts in rat hepatic fibrosis model. matsui et al.  <cit>  reported that cellular fn participates in the hepatic fibrogenesis and the hepatocellular carcinoma. in  <dig>  wang and colleagues  <cit>  used an antisense oligonucleotide , fibronectin antibody, and a small molecular compound to treat hepg <dig> . <dig> cell line, targeting to fn. their results showed that a decrease in the concentration of fn has an anti-hbv activity in hepg <dig> . <dig> cells.

earthworms have long been used as materials to make drug for antipyretic and diuretic purposes in chinese traditional medicine. furthermore, some of earthworm proteases have been prepared into enteric-coated capsules for clinical use in china for more than  <dig> years  <cit> . nakajima and co-workers  <cit>  characterized six isozymes of serine proteases with fibrinolytic activity from the earthworm . on the basis of their cleavage specificity against peptide substrates, some isozymes have both trypsin- and chymotrypsin-like activities, and some act in elastase-like function. investigations of the enzymes are focused on cardiovascular system for a long time in this lab  <cit> . we found that the proteases can activate not only prothrombin but also plasminogen. however, whether the earthworm e. fetida synthesizes a protease to degrade fn rapidly has been still unknown.

in this study, we show a novel protease from e. fetida, which cleaves fn much more quickly than the other serum proteins in vitro and in vivo. sequentially, the cleavage sites on fn by efnase and the effect on the production of hbv antigens are also exhibited.

efnase was purified by affinity chromatography as described  <cit> . briefly, crude earthworm proteases were obtained from the ammonium sulfate precipitation of the soluble proteins of earthworm e. fetida. efnase was purified on a 4-aminobenzamidine dihydrochloride-coupled sepharose cl-6b affinity column  eluted with a gradient of denaturant from  <dig>  to  <dig> m . eight amino acid residues of the n-terminus were sequenced .

human serum fibronectin digested by efnase
human serum  was incubated with different concentrations of efnase  at 37°c. after  <dig> min incubation, aliquots were taken and diluted  immediately. the reaction was terminated by addition of  <dig> × sample buffer and boiling for  <dig> min. samples  were electrophoresed on 8% sds-page. the protein bands in the gel were visualized with coomassie brilliant blue r- <dig>  then, under the same conditions, the serum degradation in the presence of efnase  was observed at different time intervals. serum in the absence of efnase and in the presence of trypsin  was used as negative and positive controls, respectively.

identification of 'fibronectin' in the serum using mass spectrometry
the quick-diminished protein band 'fibronectin' was digested by trypsin and subjected to maldi-tof ms  <cit> . the protein band of interest was excised from the gel and cut into small pieces. another piece from a protein-free region of the gel was used as a parallel control for the digestion to identify trypsin autoproteolysis products.  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> in 50% acetonitrile was added to wash the gel particles and the gel particles dried in a vacuum centrifuge.  <dig> mm dithiothreitol in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> was added, enough to cover the gel pieces and reduce at 56°c for  <dig> hr. cooled to room temperature, the dithiothreitol solution was replaced roughly by the same volume  <dig> mm iodoacetamide in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig>  samples were incubated at room temperature in the dark with occasional vortexing for  <dig> min. the gel pieces were washed with  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> for  <dig> min while vortexing. they were dehydrated with  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> in 50% acetonitrile and rehydrated with  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig> and dehydrated again. the liquid phase was removed and the gel pieces dried in a vacuum centrifuge. the gel particles were rehydrated in  <dig> mm nh4hco <dig>  containing  <dig> – <dig>  mg/ml trypsin by vortexing for  <dig> min. after incubated at 37°c for 12– <dig> h, the peptides were recovered from the gel particles and used for maldi-tof ms analysis . the peptide fingerprint was processed in the ncbi database using the mascot search program.

proof of the band 'fibronectin' by western blotting
western blotting was performed to prove the character of the protein 'fibronectin'  <cit> . different concentrations of efnase were incubated with human serum at 37°c for  <dig> h or efnase  was incubated with human serum at 37°c for different time intervals. aliquots were taken for 8% sds-page. the proteins in the gel were electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membrane . the membrane was blocked in phosphate buffer solution  containing  <dig> % nonfat milk and then incubated with primary fibronectin antibody at 37°c for  <dig> h. after rinsing with pbs plus  <dig> % tween  <dig> , the membrane was subsequently exposed to the second antibody peroxidase-conjuated igg in the same solution at 37°c for  <dig> h. immunoreactive proteins were visualized by  <dig> '-diaminobenzidine  staining, which generated a brown-colored product.

fibronectin concentration change after oral administration of efnase
six male rats  were fasted overnight. before oral administration of efnase, blood samples were drawn from the ocular vein into tubes. then efnase was given by gavage. blood samples were drawn at different time intervals . sera were prepared and stored at -20°c until determination. western blotting of the sera was conducted as mentioned above to test the change of fn. the concentrations of fn in sera were determined by elisa as described by Özkan et al  <cit>  with some modification. sera samples were diluted 1: <dig> and  <dig> μl aliquots were deposited on  <dig> well microtitration plates . the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h followed by five washing with pbst buffer. then the plates were blocked with 5% horse serum in pbs at 37°c for  <dig> h. the primary fibronectin antibody  was added 50μl per well and the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. the plates were then washed five times with pbst. peroxidase-conjuated ig g  was added  <dig> μl per well and the plates were incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. after the plates were washed five times with pbst, substrate solution   <dig> μl were dispensed per well with a multichannel pipet. the reaction was stopped by adding  <dig> μl/well  <dig>  m sulfuric acid. after sufficient color development, absorbance values were determined with an elisa reader at a wavelength of  <dig> nm immediately.

enzymolysis sites on fibronectin by efnase
to investigate enzymolysis characteristics of efnase, fn from human plasma was used. first, fn  incubated with efnase at different final concentrations  at 37°c for  <dig> min to determine the suitable concentration of efnase to cleave fn. then the proper concentration of efnase  was incubated with fn for  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> min, respectively. the cleaved products were electrophoresed on 8% reduced and non-reduced sds-page and electrotransferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane . after staining with commassie brilliant blue r- <dig>  the main digested fragments were cut out for amino acid sequencing to identify the main cleavage sites.

treatment of hepg <dig> . <dig> cells by efnase and lamivudine
hepg <dig> . <dig> cells were seeded  <dig> ×  <dig> cells per well in 96-well cell culture plates  <cit> . efnase and lamivudine  were added to the media  <dig> days after seeding. cells were grown in the presence of efnase or lamivudine for  <dig> days with changes of medium every  <dig> days. six days after treatment by efnase or lamivudine. the culture supernatants were collected and subjected to hbsag and hbeag analysis.

assays of hepatitis b surface antigen and hepatitis b e antigen
hepatitis b surface antigen  and hepatitis b e antigen  in culture media were determined using diagnostic kits for hbsag and for hbeag as described in the manufacturer's manual . the inhibition rates were calculated according to the following formula: inhibition rate  = /acontrol × 100%  <cit> .

cell viability assay
a colorimetric assay using cck- <dig> was to assess cell viability  <cit> . after the cells in 96-well plates were treated with efnase or lamivudine, the media were aspirated, and  <dig> μl of cck- <dig>  was added to each well and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. the absorbance at  <dig> nm that stands for cell growth was measured with the reference wavelength at  <dig> nm.

RESULTS
degradation of fibronectin in the presence of earthworm fibronectinase
the earthworm protease purified by ammonia sulfate precipitation followed by ionic and affinity chromatography columns showed a single band on sds-page with an apparent molecular mass of ~ <dig> kda . the n-terminal region was sequenced and the first eight amino acid residues were ivggiear. the assay in the presence of chromozym try  showed the specific activity of this protease was  <dig> units. one enzymic unit is defined as one mg of enzyme causing conversion of  <dig> μm of substrate per minute at 25°c.

sds-page of the human serum treated by different protease concentration was showed in additional file 1a. observably, a band of ~ <dig> kda protein in serum was rapidly degraded  in the presence of the protease  . serum in the absence of the protease was used as a negative control, showing little changes in the protein bands in serum . trypsin  used as a positive control  depicted a relatively low hydrolytic activity on the ~ <dig> kda protein by the densitomitric scanning analysis . this suggests that the earthworm protease has a significant high enzymic activity on the ~ <dig> kda protein.

now, the ~ <dig> kda protein should be identified. mass spectrometry was first employed . analysis on maldi-tof ms showed a peptide fingerprint of 'fibronectin' with degradation by trypsin. the database searching results indicated that the protein was 'fibronectin' with a molecular mass of ~ <dig>  da. among  <dig> peptides,  <dig> matched to the theoretical protonated molecular masses of fn tryptic fragments within  <dig> ppm . the sequences of the matched peptides  were showed in figure  <dig> 

to further prove the band of 'fibronectin', western blotting was employed. the fibronectin antibody was able to recognize the serum protein well. when different concentrations of the earthworm protease  were incubated with human serum at 37°c for  <dig> h , the ~ <dig> kda serum protein was rapidly degraded. furthermore, in the presence of the protease , the serum protein was markedly digested in  <dig> min . the digestion also showed concentration- and time-dependent character.

sequentially, the effect of efnase on fn in vivo should be investigated. as shown in figure 5a, a typical western blot pictured the degradation of fn in the rat serum after oral administration of efnase. the gray density of fn band was descent and then ascent. the relative content of serum fn significantly decreased from  <dig> to  <dig> h. elisa results showed that the mean lowest fn concentration in blood occurred at ~ <dig> h . therefore, the serum protein is fibronectin  and thus the protease is called earthworm fibronectinase .

cleavage sites on fibronectin
the digested fn fragments released from the incubation with efnase were shown in figure  <dig>  human plasma fibronectin existed mainly as  <dig> kda monomer on the reduced sds-page . as the enzyme concentration increased, the ~ <dig> kda monomer was degraded, resulting in some smaller polypeptides  and exhibiting a concentration-dependent character. almost none of intact fn remained when efnase concentration was  <dig> μm. thus,  <dig>  μm of efnase was employed to carry out the time-dependent experiment . on the gel, fn monomer disappeared within  <dig> min followed by appearance of digested bands. on reducing  and non-reducing  sds-page, over ten digested fragments appeared. with reference to the complete primary structure of human fn , four cleavage sites were determined . seven fragments  cleaved at r259/a <dig> , two  at k1557/t <dig> , one  at r2039/h <dig>  and one  at r1005/g <dig>  were exhibited. band  <dig> represented an n-terminal region fragment.

the amino acid sequence of fn is referred to fibronectin  <dig> isoform  <dig> preproprotein .

the schematic diagram of the modular structure of fn monomer is showed in figure  <dig>  the four cleavage sites are also indicated on the diagram. from n-terminal to c-terminal, the first cleavage site on fn is r259/a <dig>  this domain contains the n-terminal region that is involved in crosslinking to coagulation factor xiiia. five type i repeats are also in this region, which is bound to fibrin, heparin and bacteria. from figure 6a, bands  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> appear quickly, showing the sensitive site of r259/a <dig> to efnase. according to the n-terminal amino acid sequence  and the apparent molecular mass , we deduced band  <dig> is the fragment from q <dig> to r <dig>  the second cleavage site is at r1005/g <dig> . the collagen and gelation binding domain is reported to localize between r259/a <dig> and r1005/g <dig>  <cit> . the third cleavage site is at k1557/t <dig>  the important integrin-recognition motif rgd  is located in this part. the strongest heparin-binding site is between the third and the fourth cleavage site. a binding site for hbsag is from the variable sequence  to c-terminus  <cit> . the fourth cleavage site  is located at this region.

the main cleavage sites were at r and k, indicating a trypsin alkaline serine-like protease of efnase. bsa was used as a control for the degradation, but the efnase  depicted a little hydrolysis on bsa . this suggests again that efnase has a relatively high specificity to fn.

hbsag and hbeag assays after the cells treated by efnase and lamivudine
because fibronectinolysis may disturb the virus binding activity to fn, efnase was used to treat hepg <dig> . <dig> cells to test its potential function in hbv infection. hepg <dig> . <dig> cells were the clonal cells derived from hepg <dig> cells, transfected with a plasmid containing hbv dna. the cells secreted not only all hbv proteins but also hepatitis b virions, whilst they were remarkably down-regulated by lamivudine  <cit> . as shown in figure 8a and 8b, efnase and lamivudine were observed to inhibit the secretion of hbsag and hbeag in hepg <dig> . <dig> cell culture medium. the elisa results indicated that the secretion of hbeag was decreased by efnase much more obvious than by lamivudine. however, the inhibition of hbsag secretion in the presence of efnase was less than lamivudine under the experimental conditions.

to assess the potential toxicity of efnase and lamivudine to hepg <dig> . <dig> cells, the viability of treated cells was examined. the results showed that cell viability had little change when the concentration of efnase was lower than  <dig> nm under the experimental conditions . lamivudine had little impact on the cell growth when its concentration reached  <dig> μm .

discussion
in this study, the earthworm fnase has been found to recognize the ~ <dig> kda protein from human serum and digest it rapidly. we think that this serum protein is fn because of the following results.  the molecular mass of the protein is ~ <dig> kda, approximately equal to fn .  the n-terminal amino acid sequence is identical to that of fn .  the mass-spectrum shows a fingerprint of fn for the trypsin digested serum protein. finally,  efnase degrades the purified fn at the specific cleavage sites as mentioned above.

it is necessary to explain why we call the earthworm protease as efnase. first, we have known that r and k are the main cleavage sites for the protease, exhibiting the trypsin alkaline serine-like activity.  <dig>  μm of the protease digests fn within  <dig> min, showing a high hydrolytic activity to fn. definitely, the protease is able to recognize fn from a great number of proteins contained in human serum. under the same conditions, trypsin as a control did not rapidly degrade the serum fn. the earthworm protease did not quickly digest bsa and the other serum proteins. by in vivo experiments we have demonstrated that the relative concentration of the serum fn will decrease when the earthworm protease are orally administrated to rats. these results have given us an enlightenment to consider the protease as an fnase.

as shown in the previous studies, the earthworm e. fetida contains  <dig> trypsin-like proteases and their molecular masses are around  <dig> kda  <cit> . the apparent molecular mass of the earthworm fnase is ~ <dig> kda , similar to these proteases. the n-terminal sequence  of efnase showed identical to that of one isozymes of the earthworm protease . however, the complete gene and the intact amino acid sequence of efnase have not been clarified. whether efnase is efp-iii- <dig> remains further investigated.

to study the cleavage site of efnase on fn, we have employed plasma fn as the substrate. although plasma fn is distinct from cellular fn in some functions  <cit> , most of the amino acid sequence is similar between plasma fn and cellular fn except eda, edb and v regions. plasma fn is much more soluble than the tissue fn. thus, it is convenient for us to analyze the degraded fragments of plasma fn in the presence of efnase. from the results of plasma fn, we could predict some changes of cellular fn in the presence of the earthworm proteases. in fact, our unpublished data show that the concentration of cellular fn in the hbv transgenic mice livers is indeed decreased.

one of the important functions of fn is virus-binding activity. a high concentration of fn in blood improves the transmission frequency of hepatitis viruses  <cit> . several domains have been reported to participate in the viruses binding to fn . liu and co-workers  <cit>  have shown that fn <dig>  mediates ihnv attachment and cell entry. hiv-1iiib specifically interacts with the iii1-c region within fn and the interaction may play a role in facilitating hiv infection in vivo  <cit> . the c-terminal 120– <dig> kda fragment that carries the cell-binding activity bound influenza a  virus most efficiently  <cit> . a binding site for hbsag has been found in heparin binding region ii, and between the variable sequence  and c-terminus  <cit> . this virus-binding ability may explain the high rate of transmission of virus infections by plasma derivates enriched in fn  <cit> . in this study, we hypothesized that the cleavage of fn by efnase may have the possibility to influence the binding activity of viruses to fn and virus infections. however, the fn fragments may elicit quite different function from the intact molecule  <cit> . the cleavage products increase or decrease the binding effect needs further investigation.

for the cytological experiments, hbsag and hbeag secreted by hepg <dig> . <dig> cells were both inhibited when the cells were treated with efnase, especially the hbeag decreases more obviously. hbeag has the best correlation to the presence of infectious hbv. it is an important marker of the infection. once hbeag seroconversion takes place, there may be transition to the nonreplicative phase, characterized by normal serum liver enzymes and low hbv dna levels and reduced hepatic necroinflammation  <cit> . the significant clearance of hbeag by efnase may endow efnase a potential product to treat hbv infection diseases.

the mechanism for efnase to decrease hbeag level in the hepg <dig> . <dig> cell culture is due to two possibilities.  the cleavage of fn by efnase may disturb the virus-binding activity and may inhibit the initial steps of the virus entry into target cells.  efnase degrades hbeag directly to decrease the level of the antigen in the medium. but, this possibility should not exist because hbsag would be digested if the efnase substrate specificity was so broad that all the proteins in the medium should be destroyed. in general, the mechanism for efnase to decreases hbeag remains further to be studied.

we have tried to find a drug with the same mechanism as a positive control to the inhibition of the antigens preduced by hepg <dig> . <dig> cells. but no drug with such a characteristic was found. lamivudine is selected because it is the first-line drug in treating chronic hbv infections on clinic  <cit> . in research on hbv infections, lamivudine is commonly used as a positive control. meanwhile, lamivudine, an oral antiviral agent, has the same administration route with efnase.

we adopted an oral administration route of the protease to develop an oral administration dosage form. the fn concentration in serum decreased when efnase was orally administrated to rats. as we know, earthworm proteases have been formulated into the oral enteric-soluble capsules which protect the enzymes from degradation in stomach. this formulation whose efficiency is certified has been successfully used on clinic for more than ten years  <cit> . furthermore, previous  <cit>  and our present  investigations on the absorption of the proteases indicate that the proteases could be partially absorbed from intestines to blood.

as mentioned above, the enzyme has a high activity to hydrolyze fn in serum. however, the protease could hydrolyze some other proteins under the experimental conditions . furthermore, this protease is supposed to digest some other proteins on the hepg  <dig> . <dig> cells or in the serum of rats although we didn't detect the degradation of the proteins.

an important cleavage site should be emphasized here is r1005/g <dig>  which is involved in the binding of collagen . cutting at this site may destroy the interaction between fn and collagen. in fact, some hbv infection evolves into liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. fn is important in the fibrogenesis. during the early phase of active fibroplasia, fn production increases dramatically, and this augmentation is associated with the fibroblast proliferation thereafter responsible for excessive synthesis and deposition of the collagen protein. fn associated with collagen through the specific binding sites, which promotes the formation of fibre. the hydrolysis of fn by efnase not only decreases fn concentration directly, but also prevents the association of collagen to fn, which probably delay the formation of fibre.

the current therapeutic agents  used for the treatment of chronic hbv are mainly prevent the replicate of the viruses. but once the cirrhosis has occurred, it is difficult to be reversed  <cit> . efnase is supposed to be able to prevent both the processes, which has some advantage over interferon and nucleoside analogues. thus we think that efnase may have the potential to be developed into a new medicine to treat chronic hbv, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma patients.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, a novel efnase that cleaved fn much faster than the other proteins in mammal serum was purified from e. fetida. the results suggest that efnase may have the potential to inhibit hbv infection through its suppressing the level of fn and hbeag.
