BACKGROUND
gene duplication is a major driver for the emergence of organismal complexity and evolutionary innovations  <cit> . tandem duplication is the most common route to the formation of clustered paralogous genes  <cit> . a newly duplicated gene must diverge from its progenitor gene in coding sequence or expression, or it will degenerate due to redundancy  <cit> . to acquire novel transcription patterns, tandemly duplicated genes need to interrupt expression similarity due to shared upstream cis-elements upon origin  <cit>  and transcriptional interference contributed by physical proximity  <cit> . despite the challenges, functionally important gene clusters consisting of paralogs with distinct expression patterns are found in a wide range of species, including human  <cit> . therefore, it is important to understand the origin and maintenance of expression divergence between tandem paralogs.

ccctc-binding factor , the only known human insulator protein, plays a master role in determining the transcriptional landscape of genomes. when bound to insulator sequences , ctcf can prevent repressive heterochromatin from spreading into neighboring regions  <cit> . in addition, ctcf interferes with enhancer-promoter communication  <cit>  and guides long-range chromatin interactions  <cit> . because changes in epigenetic marks play roles in regulatory divergence of duplicated genes , we hypothesize that ctcf also plays a role. using human rna-seq and chip-seq data , we examined how ctcf drives regulatory divergence of duplicated genes, especially tandemly arrayed paralogs.

RESULTS
in the genome, adjacent genes are coexpressed due to a common origin  <cit> , cofunctionality  <cit> , or deleterious transcriptional interference  <cit> . using rna-seq data from six human adult tissues  <cit> , we measured gene expression dissimilarity between adjacent genes in terms of expression profile or expression level using expd1-r or expdeuc , respectively. expd1-r focused on changes in the shape across the tissue dimension, while expdeuc focused on summed changes in abundance. we studied divergences in both profiles and abundances because previous studies have shown that the observations from the two aspects did not necessarily produce consistent results  <cit> , possibly due to different underlying mechanisms controlling the properties  <cit> .

mammalian genes close to each other have similar expression profiles  <cit> . ctcf-binding sites can prevent undesirable crosstalk between active and inactive genomic regions  <cit> . dna methylation upstream of a gene can inhibit its transcriptional initiation  <cit> . to determine if the effect of intergenic distance, the number of ctcf-binding sites, and dna methylation is related to shared evolutionary origin, we measured expd1-r and expdeuc in non-paralogous adjacent genes. non-paralogous gene pairs with a longer intergenic distance , more overlapping ctcf-binding sites , or a larger difference in upstream dna methylation  had greater expd1-r or expdeuc . although d, #ctcf, and Δcpgo/e were interrelated , partial correlation analyses  suggested that the effects of d, #ctcf, and Δcpgo/e on generating expression dissimilarity between adjacent genes was independent. d had the largest direct influence on expd1-r, and Δcpgo/e had the largest direct influence on expdeuc. #ctcf had a weak but significant effect on expd1-r and an intermediate effect on expdeuc . although ctcf binding can vary among cell types  <cit> , when we define #ctcf using joint ctcf chip-seq peaks  instead of overlapping ctcf peaks, the results did not change .table  <dig> rank correlations  and partial rank correlations  of the genomic properties with expression dissimilarities  of the non-paralogous adjacent genes

mechanisms generating coding sequence divergence, such as change in protein structure or splicing, between paralogous genes have been intensively investigated . by contrast, mechanisms generating expression divergence have garnered less attention. although #ctcf was not the strongest determinant of expression divergence in non-paralogous adjacent gene pairs , for adjacent paralogs, #ctcf had the greatest direct influence on expd1-r and expdeuc, followed by Δcpgo/e . repeating analysis based on an independently generated and unpublished rna-seq dataset including  <dig> human tissues  produced a result consistent with table  <dig> and  <dig> , suggesting the robustness of the pattern found.table  <dig> rank correlations  and partial rank correlations  of the examined genomic properties with expression dissimilarities  of the paralogous adjacent genes

we classified adjacent paralogs into three groups according the orientations: head-to-head, head-to-tail and tail-to-tail  <cit> . although reduced sample sizes resulted in reduced statistical significance, the pattern of the greatest impact #ctcf on expression divergences held regardless of the orientation of paralogs . using microarray expression data, a previous study found that intergenic distance was related to expression divergence for tandemly arrayed paralogs  <cit> . however, microarray data is known to have cross-hybridization related biases  <cit> , and we found no direct association between intergenic distance and expression divergence for tandemly arrayed paralogs after controlling for #ctcf and Δcpgo/e . taken together, these results suggest that ctcf-binding sites play a very significant, if not primary, role in driving expression divergence of tandemly duplicated genes.table  <dig> rank correlations  and partial rank correlations  of the examined genomic properties with expression dissimilarities  of the adjacent paralogous genes of different orientations.

there are two hypotheses to explain the influence of ctcf-binding sites in driving expression divergence of tandem paralogs. first, tandem paralogs that arose in genomic regions with high densities of ctcf-binding sites nearby are more likely to be preserved due to immediate independence of gene regulation. second, ctcf-binding sites accumulated over time to enhance independent gene regulation of tandem paralogs, especially those have been functionally diverged. if the first hypothesis is correct, there would be no correlation between the divergence time of paralogs  and #ctcf. however, we observed a positive correlation between ds or tphy and #ctcf , suggesting that the second hypothesis is correct. #ctcf had stronger rank correlation , which is positive, to ds  than d and Δcpgo/e . partial correlation analyses further suggested that the increase of #ctcf with ds  is not caused by the change in d or Δcpgo/e or their combined effect over time . by contrast, the insignificant partial correlation of d with respect to ds  indicated that the increase d over time can be explained by the increase in the number of ctcf-binding sites and the associated changes in dna methylation.table  <dig> rank correlations  and partial rank correlations  of the examined genomic properties with the divergence time of the paralogous adjacent genes.

to determine whether tandem paralogs with specific functions tend to have a greater number of intervening ctcf-binding sites, we performed enrichment analyses in gene ontology  terms. to eliminate the potential effect of duplicability in go analysis  <cit> , paralogous and non-paralogous gene pairs were analyzed separately. to control for the potential effect of gene density  <cit> , #ctcf/d was used instead of #ctcf . gene pairs in the top quartile of ctcf-binding site density  were compared against the bottom three quartiles. enriched/depleted go terms for the paralog group were substantially different from those in the non-paralog group . only two go terms  had the same enrichment status  in both groups. tandemly duplicated genes with a higher density of intervening ctcf-binding sites tended to specifically encode proteins involved in gene expression , metabolic processes , or cellular processes  through dna binding , smad binding , growth factor binding , or kinase interaction  in receptor complexes  or intracellular regions  . this result implied that the densities of ctcf binding sites between tandem paralogs were not contributed by the genomic background.table  <dig> enriched/depleted go terms at level  <dig> for genes with high #ctcf/d flanking regions

genomic regions of high densities of ctcf binding sites can emerge through stochastic evolutionary processes. to examine if high ctcf-binding site density between tandem duplicates is the outcome of gradual ctcf-binding site accumulation by natural selection, we focused on the subset of  <dig> paralogous pairs in which at least one paralog had one of the abovementioned enriched go categories. in this subset of tandem paralogs, ρp of #ctcf vs. ds  after controlling for d and Δcpgo/e was stronger  than that observed in the full set of adjacent paralogs  . when #ctcf was defined by joint ctcf chip-seq peaks rather than overlapping ctcf peaks, the results were similar . therefore, the trend to accumulate ctcf-binding sites following a tandem duplication event resulted in more ctcf-binding sites  between paralogs, especially for those with enriched go-categories shown in table  <dig> 

CONCLUSIONS
combining human genomic and transcriptomic data, this study demonstrates that ctcf and its binding sites play a major role driving the expression evolution of tandemly duplicated genes. following tandem duplication events, ctcf-binding sites gradually accumulate between the paralogs to increase their divergences in expression profile and their divergences in expression level. the role of ctcf-binding sites is not limited to the insulation of dna methylation domains, because the effects of #ctcf on expd1-r  were still significant even after controlling for Δcpgo/e . thus, ctcf, a conserved regulatory protein  <cit> , affects the expression evolution of adjacent genes in genomes from flies  <cit>  to humans and is important for the evolution of organismal complexity in animals.
