BACKGROUND
the vacuolar h+- atpase is a  <dig> kda protein complex essential for all eukaryotes. the translocation of protons energised by the hydrolysis of atp drives secondary transport across endomembranes generating a proton motive force  <cit> . this emphasises its importance for the maintenance of the intracellular ph and in ion homeostasis  <cit> . in addition, the v-atpase is essential for sorting proteins within the secretory pathway  <cit> , cell elongation in conjunction with plant development  <cit>  and was postulated to be a key player in membrane fusion events in s. cerevisiae  <cit> .

the v-atpase is a bidomain enzyme complex comprising the cytosolic v <dig> sector and the transmembrane v <dig> sector. both to be considered two functionally coupled subenzymes  <cit> . the chemical energy from atp-hydrolysis within the catalytic head of the v1-domain is transduced into the rotation of the membrane-integral proteolipid ring that transports protons across endomembranes  <cit> . the atp-hydrolysing hexameric head of alternatingly arranged subunits vha-a and vha-b forms the core complex of the v <dig> sector, while the proton-translocating sector v <dig> is dominated by a ring of most likely six proton-binding proteolipid subunits  <cit> . the proteolipid ring and the membrane integral portion of the  <dig> kda subunit vha-a catalyse the proton translocation across the membrane  <cit> . the proteolipid subunits of the v-atpase are homologous to subunit c of the f-atpsynthases and evolved by fused gene duplication from a common ancestor  <cit> . accordingly, the subunit c of f-atpsynthase is characterised by two transmembrane helices, whereas vha-c possesses four transmembrane segments with only one proton binding site conserved at the fourth helix  <cit> . though vha-c" maintained two conserved glutamate residues during evolution which are located at helices  <dig> and  <dig>  only the first one is functional  <cit> . it is due to structural peculiarities like the different positions of the catalytic glutamate residues, the low level of identity between vha-c and vha-c" and the presence of an additional helical segment in vha-c" that the transmembrane topology is still subject of controversial discussion. particularly, the hydrophobicity of the first helix remains unclear leading to topological predictions with either four or five transmembrane segments  <cit> . furthermore, the helix  <dig> of the yeast vha-c" was demonstrated to be essential for vha-activity  <cit>  whereas nishi et al.   <cit>  reported its insignificance for proton transport. however, this helix  <dig> is missing in plants and yeast. Δvma16-  mutants were successfully complemented with arabidopsis atvha-c"  <cit> .

the small hydrophobic subunit vha-e was first identified in bovine brain atpase  <cit> . recently the vha-e homologue vma9p was identified in yeast  <cit> . two unexplored vha-e isoforms exist in a. thaliana  <cit> . current knowledge on vha-e is restricted to its importance in v-atpase assembly and function in yeast  <cit> .

in recent years the orientation of the c-terminus of vma16p was investigated intensively by exploring the accessibility of fused protein tags with tag-specific antibodies or proteolysis in the presence or absence of detergents, respectively  <cit> .

to address these open question with an alternative technique, we applied in vivo fret measurements to analyse the orientation of the c-terminus of vha-c" relative to well characterised proteins like vha-c and vha-a. the fret results demonstrate a high structural similarity of vha-c" and vha-c. additional fret-experiments indicate the presence of more than one vha-e copy in the vha-complex. vha-c" and vha-e isoform  <dig> assemble in distinct complexes with different subcellular localisation, whereas vha-c" and vha-e isoform  <dig> are incorporated in the same complex.

RESULTS
in silico sequence analysis
two isoforms of vha-c" were identified in the a. thaliana genome  <cit> . the isoforms at2g <dig>  and at4g <dig>  are identical except of three amino acids at the n-terminus. compared to the corresponding yeast proteolipid vma16p plant vha-c" lacks the first transmembrane helix resulting in a protein consisting of  <dig> aminoacids instead of  <dig>  the remaining transmembrane segments of vha-c" are highly conserved:  <dig> out of  <dig> aa are similar and  <dig> identical among the analysed sequences . the vha-e amino acid sequences from a. thaliana, b. taurus, s. cerevisiae and m. sexta are identical to 17–32%, and the identity between both a. thaliana isoforms is 85%. two transmembrane regions were identified comprised of aa 2– <dig> and 30– <dig> of atvha-e <dig> . to compare functional elements in vha-c and vha-c", a hybrid proteolipid  was constructed consisting of vha-c helices 3– <dig> and vha-c" helices 3– <dig>  the variant is characterised by the presence of four predicted transmembrane segments. this helix arrangement matches the suggested ancestral topology of vha-c- and vha-c"-subunits. the molecular mass of the hybrid protein as calculated with protparam was  <dig>  da as compared to  <dig>  da of vha-c and  <dig>  da of vha-c", and the isoelectric point ip was  <dig>  which was similar to that of vha-c" .

transcript analysis of proteolipid subunits
transcript analysis of vha-c isoforms by rt-pcr revealed the preferential presence of vha-c <dig> and scarcely detected vha-c <dig> in either roots or leaves of a. thaliana . vha-c <dig> transcript was detected in leaf tissue , although vha-c <dig> was described as being expressed in a rather root specific manner before  <cit> . our results are in line with a recent proteomics approach where vha-c <dig> was identified at the tonoplast of a. thaliana leaf tissue  <cit> . the analysis of vha-c" isoforms in a. thaliana revealed an almost exclusive expression of vha-c" <dig> with only marginal expression of vha-c" <dig> . water as template served as a negative control in additional rt-pcrs and amplification products were absent as expected. these data supported the decision to subsequently focus the study on vha-c" <dig> and to use vha-c <dig> as reference in mesophyll protoplasts, except of the study on the subcellular localisation which also included vha-c" <dig> 

subcellular localisation
a set of genetic fusions between fluorescent proteins and vha-subunits was produced in order to investigate the subcellular distribution of the proteolipid subunits as well as of the vha-e isoforms. besides full length constructs of vha-c <dig>  vha-c" <dig>  vha-c" <dig>  vha-e <dig> and vha-e <dig> truncated variants of vha-c <dig> and vha-c" <dig> were generated. the truncated variants comprised only the third and fourth helices of the proteolipid subunits vha-c <dig> and vha-c" <dig>  whereas the full length vha-subunits and the truncated vha-c were fused to the n-terminus of the fluorescent protein, the truncated vha-c" was fused to the c-terminus of cfp and yfp, respectively. furthermore, helices three and four of vha-c and helices three and four were linked and fused to a fluorescent protein. this construct was denominated hybrid proteolipid subunit. the yfp fusion proteins were transiently expressed in a. thaliana mesophyll protoplasts. fluorescence of v0-subunit constructs was observed at their corresponding destination endomembrane compartments within 3– <dig> hours. in the subsequent hours no indications were found for further alterations of the detected subcellular localisation, e.g. due to significant protein expression and accumulation.

analysis of vha-c" revealed a distribution of both vha-c" isoforms restricted to parts of the endomembrane system. thus, fusion protein was detected in the er-network and associated globular structures, but was absent from the tonoplast . the truncated vha-c" <dig> behaved in a similar manner. in contrast, the hybrid proteolipid subunit was localised at the tonoplast. the localisation pattern was similar to that previously reported for vha-c and vha-e  <cit> . the vha-e isoforms revealed a distinct subcellular localisation. the vha-e2-fusion protein gave a pattern alike that of vha-c", while the vha-e <dig> accumulated to low levels in the er . this particular image resembled that from previous observations for the tgn-specific subunit vha-a <dig>  <cit> .

stoichiometry of vha-e and vha-c"
to address the question whether one or more copies of vha-c" <dig> and vha-e <dig> assemble within the complex, protoplasts were co-transfected with two vectors each of the vha-subunits fused to cfp or yfp and analysed for fret-efficiency between the reporters in vivo. an increase in energy transfer efficiency was expected for those subunits that are known to be incorporated into the complex with several copies like vha-c. indeed, vha-c showed a rate of energy transfer as high as  <dig> %, whereas vha-c" yielded only  <dig> % indicating its presence as monomer in the complex . no significant difference was identified by student's t-test  between the vha-c"-cfp/vha-c"-yfp- and the vha-e1-cfp/vha-c"-yfp-dataset, which serves as negative control. a fret value of 8–10% was defined in earlier studies to mark the background level in the absence of structural interaction-based fret due to the low signal intensity in the fret-channel  <cit> . despite the background level, the low signal intensity is also affected by the variability of cfp- and yfp reference measurements. furthermore, the 10% fret efficiency corresponds to a distance of approximately  <dig>  nm and hence exceeds the diameter of the proteolipid ring, which was estimated to be 6– <dig>  nm  <cit> . the fret-data based conclusion on a single vha-c" subunit was confirmed by a bimolecular fluorescence complementation approach. cotransfection with two vha-c"-constructs fused either to the c- or n-terminal fragment of yfp failed in functional fluorophore formation. in a converse manner, the control with cotransfected constructs coding solely for complementary n- and c-terminal fragments of yfp in the cytosol displayed a higher level of fluorophore formation. interestingly, coexpression of vha-c"-yfp and its truncated counterpart vha-c"trunc fused to cfp revealed a fret efficiency of  <dig> %, thus indicating the co-existence of both proteins in single v-atpase complexes. measurements involving vha-e fused to cfp and yfp, respectively, indicated the presence of more than one copy of vha-e in the complex. the observed fret efficiency was in the range of 20–25% for the combinations of vha-e1/e <dig>  vha-e2/e <dig> and vha-e1/e <dig>  apparently, a significant preference for isoform-specific interactions does not exist for the vha-e1/e <dig> isoforms  .

fret between transmembrane vha-proteolipid subunits
the relationship between structure and assembly was studied using fret efficiency determinations between vha-c fused to yfp as acceptor and the proteolipid constructs fused to cfp as donor. the latter set of contructs consisted of the full length vha-c" <dig>  the truncated variants vha-ctrunc and vha-c"trunc as well as the hybrid proteolipid containing helices  <dig> and  <dig> each of vha-c <dig> and vha-c" <dig>  in this approach no significant difference could be observed for vha-c <dig>  vha-c" <dig>  vha-c"1trunc and the hybrid proteolipid subunit . the fret efficiencies ranged between 20–23%, whereas the incorporation of vha-ctrunc increased the fret efficiency to very high  <dig> % . a similar effect was observed upon introducing vha-c"-yfp  and vha-a-yfp  as acceptor partners for vha-ctrunc fused to cfp .

fret between proteolipid subunits-cfp-fusions and vha-a-yfp
the next set of experiments addressed the structural interrelation between vha-a and the proteolipid subunits. vha-c <dig> and vha-c" <dig> yielded similar fret efficiencies in the range of 25–32% with vha-a. however, the datasets differed slightly according to t-test evaluation . the fret efficiency value increased strongly between vha-a and vha-ctrunc, vha-c"trunc and the hybrid form, respectively, with fret values in the range of  <dig>  to  <dig> % . vha-c"trunc is characterised by the absence of a functional glutamate residue, while the hybrid lacks a functional glutamate at helix  <dig> .

fret efficiency between vha-e-cfp and the acceptors vha-a-yfp, vha-c-yfp and vha-c"-yfp
both vha-e isoforms were characterised by an energy transfer of approximately 20% relative to vha-a and vha-c. no significant difference was observed for vha-e <dig> and vha-e <dig> . only vha-c" showed a specifity for vha-e <dig>  while vha-e <dig> revealed marginal efficiency  consistent with its distinct subcellular localisation  .

fret efficiency between vha-a-yfp and vha-a-cfp
fret is occasionally considered as sensitive to artefacts. to address this important issue subsequent experiments investigated  the assembly of v <dig> and v <dig> subunits to a complete v-atpase complex and  potential artefacts as a consequence of overexpression, which should fail to associate in v0-v <dig> complexes. protoplasts were co-transfected exemplarily with vha-a-yfp and vha-a-cfp. the fret-efficiency between both labelled subunits was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , hence demonstrating the efficient association of the subsectors v <dig> and v <dig> each bearing fluorophore fusions.

discussion
the presented experiments on subcellular localisation and quantitative in vivo fret were performed to gain new insight in the function and isoform specifity of the proteolipid subunit vha-c" and the membrane integral subunit vha-e. in addition the fret-measurements addressed the stoichiometry of vha-subunits and the relative distances of the labeled termini. the energy transfer observed between cfp-labeled vha-e <dig>  vha-e <dig>  vha-c <dig>  vha-c" and yfp-labeled vha-a proved that the complete v0-complex is formed under conditions of fusion protein overexpression. this conclusion is supported by the observed energy transfer between multiple combinations of differently labeled proteolipids as well as between proteolipids and vha-e. functional incorporation of vha-fusion proteins in the complex has been demonstrated before:  without losing their function transgenic arabidopsis thaliana were complemented with gfp-tagged vha-a isoforms  <cit> .  co-expression of vha-a-yfp and vha-c-cfp in rice protoplasts displayed an increase in fret-efficiency in response to salinity in a salt sensitive line but not in the salt tolerant line pokkali. hence, these results demonstrate structural implication of salinity by decreasing the proteolipid ring diameter.  the obvious structural alterations were accompanied by increased vacuolar acidification as expected for a decreased h+/atp ratio  <cit> . furthermore, vha-a as well as vha-e were reported to require fully assembled v0-complexes to exit the er. unassembled vha-a gets rapidly degraded in yeast  <cit> . in addition, the highly hydrophobic subunit vha-e is postulated to associate with both the vha-a and the proteolipid ring  <cit> . except of the peripheral subunits vha-c and vha-h, which were demonstrated to be not essential for assembly in yeast  <cit> , overexpression of individual v1-subunits results mainly in a destabilised and rapidly degraded fraction of excessively formed proteins similar to vha-a. this was demonstrated for plant, yeast and insect v-atpase subunits  <cit> . all these independent approaches confirm the validity of our approach since the modified v0-sectors associate with the v1-subsectors as demonstrated by the efficient energy transfer between vha-a-cfp and vha-a-yfp. although the ratio of endogenous subunits and their corresponding fluorescent fusion proteins was not determined, the observed rates of energy transfer demonstrate the coexistence of cfp- and yfp-labeled subunits within single complexes. the absence of vha-e and vha-c" at the tonoplast is in agreement with published data on purified tonoplast proteins isolated and analyzed by mass spectrometry from tobacco  <cit>  or a. thaliana  <cit> . most vha-polypeptides including the hydrophobic vha-a and vha-c were identified in the tonoplast fraction, while vha-c" and vha-e were undetectable. the reticulate distribution of vha-c" and vha-e <dig> resembles the pattern which was reported previously for the er-network and associated golgi-bodies  <cit> . in contrast, vha-e <dig> was found in bodies which appeared only partially to be associated with the er. the structures resembled the subcellular localisation of the tgn-specific vha-a <dig> isoform  <cit> . in agreement with the different subcellular localisation, energy transfer was not observed between the fret pairs vha-c"-cfp and vha-e1-yfp. since the localisation of vha-c" in plants also resembles the localisation of vha-c" in mice  <cit> , the er and golgi-specificity of vha-c" might be a general feature of vha-c" in  eukaryotes.

misfolded proteins of the secretory pathway often accumulate in the er. this mechanism is referred to as unfolded protein response   <cit> . it is rather unlikely that this process is causially responsible for the subcellular distribution observed for vha-c" and vha-e <dig>  besides the truncated vha-c", the truncated vha-c-yfp as well as the hybrid proteolipid subunit represent highly artificial proteolipid subunits that probably are strongly affected in their function. both were not retained in the er but were directed to the tonoplast. overexpression of the er- and golgi-specific vha-a isoform stv1p resulted in at least partial replacement of the vacuolar isoform vph1p in yeast, but not in retaining at the er  <cit> . a similar effect cannot be excluded for the plant isoforms but also cannot provide an explanation for the exclusive localisation of vha-c" and vha-e in the er but also the golgi. the proteolipid subunits of v-atpase are closely related to subunit c of the f-atpsynthase. however during evolution, vha-c underwent a gene duplication event with fusion of the coding regions likely generating an intermediate form with two catalytic glutamate residues  <cit> . while vha-c lost the n-terminal one of these two catalytic glutamate residues, vha-c" still is characterised by the presence of two conserved glutamate residues located in the helices  <dig> and  <dig>  <cit> . both helices are equivalent to tm <dig> of the f-atpase subunit c, but only the glu of tm <dig> is functional  <cit> . thus, vha-c" interacts and can be crosslinked with vha-a via tm <dig>  <cit> . in contrast to the structural relationship between vha-c" and the atpsynthase subunit c and thus between vha-c and vha-c", a cytosolic orientation of the vha-c" n-terminus and the presence of  <dig> transmembrane regions was reported  <cit> . aviezar-hagai et al.  <cit>  as well as kawasaki-nishi et al.  <cit>  provided evidence for the presence of  <dig> transmembrane helices, with a cytosolic orientation of helix  <dig> as well as of the c-terminus. recently, fusion proteins of vha-c and vha-c" were expressed in yeast strains disrupted in vha-c". the vha-c-c" construct complemented the vma- phenotype in yeast  <cit> . the fret-results of our work comply with the topology models of lumen-exposed c- and n-termini suggested by flannery et al.  <cit>  and wang et al.  <cit>  since very similar transfer efficiencies were obtained in our experiments involving vha-c" and vha-c, respectively. additional support for this particular model derives from the incorporation of the hybrid proteolipid subunit into the complex, which appeared to be recognised as vha-c-like. surprisingly high fret-efficiencies were detected between the hybrid protein and the truncated vha-c", respectively, as donors and vha-a as acceptor, whereas energy transfer between vha-c and the truncated vha-c" or the hybrid protein was similar to the energy transfer observed between vha-c-cfp and vha-c-yfp. the result can tentatively be explained by an increased probability for a confirmation where the proteolipid ring stays in a position with the truncated vha-c" and the hybrid proteolipid subunit, respectively, residing next to vha-a. this arrangement might be a steric effect caused by the position of the fluorophore at the n-terminus of vha-c" helix  <dig> or by the lack of a catalytically active helix, which was demonstrated to alter its confirmation when it passes the vha-a during the catalytic cycle  <cit> . in this scenario, the fluorophores fused to the proteolipid subunit and to vha-a, respectively, are localised in close vicinity at the proteolipid/vha-a interface leading to the observed increase in fret efficiency. in contrast, the truncated vha-c-cfp showed a high energy transfer with vha-c-yfp and vha-a-yfp as acceptor, respectively. this demonstrates the reduction of the average distances between the proteolipid subunits and between vha-a and the truncated vha-c and is suggested to indicate the reduction of the proteolipid ring diameter by the replacement of the native proteolipids with  <dig> by truncated subunits with only  <dig> transmembrane helices. in a simplified calculation, incorporation of each molecule of truncated vha-c instead of vha-c may decrease the circumference by 1/12th part due to the lack of two transmembrane helices out of  <dig>  assuming a proteolipid ring diameter of initially  <dig>  nm, an increase of fret-efficiency from approximately 20% to 40% would correspond to the replacement of two subunits vha-c by the truncated vha-c. acclimatory alterations of the proteolipid ring diameter in response to salinity were reported before for the v-atpase of oryza sativa  <cit>  and mesembryanthemum crystallinum, but postulated to be caused by a reduced number of proteolipids  <cit> .

gibson et al.  <cit>  suggested a dimerization of vha-c" in yeast whereas powell et al.  <cit>  could identify only one copy of vha-c" within the vha-complex. our results of low fret efficiency between vha-c"-cfp and vha-c"-yfp and the absence of yfp-fluorescence in vha-c"-splityfp approaches indicate the presence of monomeric vha-c". the afore reported dimerization might be caused by v <dig> trans complexes or fusion pore formation as postulated by peters et al.  <cit>  and thus represents a close arrangement of two proteolipid rings. the fret-pair vha-c"-cfp and vha-e2-yfp may be taken as a negative control as both subunits are located in distinct complexes. the slightly higher fret-efficiency between vha-c"-cfp and vha-c"-yfp might be caused by temporary v <dig> trans complexes as well, but in this scenario the distance between the fluorophores would span two membranes and thus exceed  <dig> nm.

the membrane integral subunit vha-e is encoded by two isogenes in a. thaliana. the yfp-fusions vha-e1-yfp and vha-e2-yfp differed in their subcellular localisation but both were absent from the tonoplast. since the v-atpase is active in the vacuolar membrane, vha-e is not essential for proton pumping activity. based on the vha-e isoforms, three types of v-atpases are suggested to be formed, which differ in their subcellular localisation .  v-atpases containing vha-e <dig> are localised to the putative tgn.  v-atpase containing vha-e <dig>  remain in the er and  v-atpases lacking both vha-e isoforms can be found at the tonoplast. these findings suggest a role of vha-e in v-atpase sorting along the secretory pathway rather than in catalysis. in addition, more than one copy of vha-e was identified within the complex by fret independent of the isoforms. up to now, vha-e was reported to be monomeric  <cit> . the fret-efficiency was approximately 20% for the fret pairs vha-e-cfp/vha-a-yfp and vha-e-cfp/vha-c-yfp. thus, vha-e seems to reside next to the interface of vha-a and vha-c.

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, vha-c" is a single copy subunit within the v-atpase complex and localises to the er and golgi, but is absent from the tonoplast. its structure resembles that of vha-c with the exception of the catalytically essential glutamate residue, which is localised in the second helix instead in the fourth. the plant v0-sector was identified as highly flexible complex, which tolerates the incorporation of truncated as well as hybrid proteolipid subunits. the structural flexibility may be the basis of a long term regulation of v-atpase activity by alterations of the proteolipid ring diameter, allowing the adaptation to environmental stress conditions like salinity by tuning transport capacity and coupling ratio  <cit> . the subunit vha-e consists of two membrane integral helices and is incorporated into the vha-complex with more than one copy. the vha-e isoforms in a. thaliana showed a distinct subcellular localisation, however, both were absent from the tonoplast like vha-c" confirming previous proteomics studies  <cit> . since the v-atpase is active at the tonoplast, vha-c" as well as vha-e isoforms can not be essential for proton transport in plant v-atpase. it should be noted that although regulatory modulation of the v-atpase activity by vha-c" and vha-e can not be fully excluded, it seems more likely that these subunits are involved in organelle-specific assembly or sorting of v-atpases along the secretory pathway. the er-specific v-atpase complexes contain vha-c" and vha-e <dig>  while the putative tgn-specific complex contains vha-e <dig> and the vacuolar complex neither vha-c" nor vha-e.
