BACKGROUND
pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous gram negative bacterium and an opportunistic human pathogen, in particular responsible for the chronic lung infection of cystic fibrosis patients. p. aeruginosa produces rhamnolipids, which are glycolipidic biosurfactants consisting of one or two hydrophilic l-rhamnose molecules  and of a hydrophobic fatty acid moiety, see  <cit>  for review. rhamnolipids are involved in a number of functions, such as the uptake of poorly soluble substrates, surface motility, biofilm development, or interaction with the immune system  <cit> , and are considered as virulence factors. most of the rhamnolipid biosynthetic pathway is clearly established  <cit> : rmla, rmlb, rmlc, and rmld are responsible for dtdp-l-rhamnose synthesis from glucose-1-phosphate, while rhla supplies the acyl moieties by converting two molecules of β-hydroxylacyl-acyl carrier protein  in one molecule of β-d- alkanoic acid . finally, the rhamnosyltransferase rhlb links one l-rhamnose molecule to one haa to yield one mono-rhamnolipid, which either will be the final product or will be the substrate of the second rhamnosyltransferase rhlc to obtain one di-rhamnolipid. rhlg was described as an nadph-dependent β-ketoacyl reductase specifically involved in rhamnolipid synthesis  <cit> . it was proposed to work just upstream of rhla, converting one β-ketoacyl-acp molecule in one β-hydroxylacyl-acp  <cit> . these conclusions were based on: i) the amino acid sequence similarities between rhlg and fabg, which is part of the general fatty acid synthetic pathway; ii) the absence of rhamnolipid production by an rhlg mutant of p. aeruginosa pao1; and iii) similarities between the promoters of the rhlg gene and of the rhlab operon, suggesting a coordinated expression of the genes involved in rhamnolipid synthesis  <cit> . however, two subsequent articles questioned the rhlg function. a structural and biochemical study of rhlg confirmed that it is an nadph-dependent β-ketoacyl reductase, but indicated that the rhlg substrates are not carried by the acp  <cit> . zhu and rock  <cit>  then reported that rhlg was not required for rhamnolipid synthesis in the heterologous host escherichia coli and that rhlg mutants of p. aeruginosa pa <dig> and pao <dig> were not affected in rhamnolipid production. these authors concluded that rhlg plays no role in rhamnolipid formation and that its physiological substrate remains to be identified  <cit> . the transcriptional regulation of the rhlg gene has not been so far studied in more details than in  <cit> . among the rhamnolipid-related genes, the rhlab operon was the first and most extensively studied at the transcription level. these works led to the discovery of the rhlri quorum sensing  system, which is encoded by genes lying just downstream of rhlab and is required for rhlab transcription  <cit> . rhlri is a luxri-type qs system  <cit> , rhli synthesizing the communication molecule n-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone  which binds to the transcription regulator rhlr. medina et al.  <cit>  showed that rhlr directly binds to a specific dna sequence upstream of rhla, regardless of the presence or not of c4-hsl. without c4-hsl, rhlr would act as a transcriptional repressor of rhlab, whereas rhlr/c4-hsl would activate transcription. it should be noted that the rhlri system is embedded within a complex qs network including the lasri system with its autoinducer n--l-homoserine lactone  and the pseudomonas quinolone signal  system  <cit> , but rhlr is the main direct qs regulator of rhlab transcription  <cit> . a single transcription start site identified upstream of rhla could result from two putative promoters, one of which would dependent on the alternative sigma factor σ <dig>  and the other on the primary sigma factor σ <dig> <cit> . rhamnolipid production was indeed impaired in rpon mutants  <cit> , but subsequent data showed that the rhlr/c4-hsl complex activates the rhla promoter independently from σ <dig> <cit>  and it remains unclear if the latter acts only indirectly on rhlab transcription. determining the 5′ end of rhlg mrnas by primer extension led to the identification of two overlapping promoters likely dependent on the sigma factors σ <dig> and σ <dig> <cit> . these promoters are preceded by a putative “lux box” which could be a lasr and/or rhlr target sequence  <cit> . since the rhlg mrna concentration was only slightly lower in a lasr mutant than in the wildtype strain, it was concluded that lasr is not a direct activator of rhlg transcription, but it remained possible that rhlr plays this role  <cit> . rhlg was thus proposed to be regulated similarly as the rhlab operon  <cit> , consistently with the notion that the encoded enzymes belong to the same biosynthesis pathway. it turned out later that the transcription of the pa1131-rhlc and the rmlbdac operons is also mainly dependent on rhlr/c4-hsl, and the pa1131-rhlc promoter was proposed to be σ54-dependent  <cit> .

in previous works, we examined the effect of hyperosmotic stress on rhamnolipid production, accumulation of qs communications molecules, and expression levels of related key genes  <cit> . we observed that hyperosmotic condition led to down-regulations of rhlab and rhlc and prevented rhamnolipid production. these works prompted us to investigate in more details the transcriptional regulation of rhlg and to compare its transcription pattern to the rhlab and rhlc ones. here, we mapped the rhlg promoters, confirming that the σ70-dependent promoter is functional and identifying a third promoter dependent on the alternative sigma factor algu. on the contrary to rhlab and rhlc, rhlg was down-regulated by quorum sensing and induced under hyperosmotic stress. we constructed single pao <dig> mutants with deletions in rhlg or pa <dig> , and the double rhlg/pa <dig> mutant. the phenotypes of the mutants confirmed that rhlg is not involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis.

RESULTS
rhlg transcription is dependent on three sigma factors: σ <dig>  algu and σ54
we used 5′-race pcr to determine which promoter mainly controls rhlg transcription when cells were grown during 24 h in ppgas medium, which favors rhamnolipid production  <cit> . we used the p. aeruginosa pao <dig> strain containing pab <dig>  which carries the luxcdabe operon under the control of the rhlg promoter region , extending from −  <dig> to − <dig> relative to the first base of the rhlg translation initiation codon. we chose this strain since the multi-copy pab <dig> plasmid led to higher amounts of mrnas than the genomic mono-copy rhlg gene, thereby facilitating the experiment. three internal luxcdabe primers were used to synthesize cdnas and amplify them by pcr. a mix of two dna fragments, both of ~  <dig> pb was obtained after the last pcr. they were sequenced, identifying two different transcription start sites at positions − <dig> and − <dig> relative to the rhlg translation initiation codon . the weakest signal  corresponded to the transcription start site previously identified by campos garcia et al. <cit>  as arising from a σ70-dependent promoter. the strongest signal  revealed a novel transcription start site preceded by the sequence caacct − n16 − tctg, which is similar to the consensus sequence for algu-dependent promoters, gaactt − n16–17 − tctg  <cit> . algu is the extra-cytoplasmic function  sigma factor involved in alginate overproduction leading to mucoidy, response to some stresses, and biofilm stability  <cit> .

the pab <dig> plasmid was primarily constructed to quantify the prrhlg activity in the course of bacterial growth by measuring the luminescence resulting from the luxcdabe proteins. to verify the role of algu in the transcription of rhlg, p. aeruginosa pao <dig> and its algu mutant strain paou  <cit>  were transformed by pab <dig>  and pab <dig>  strains were grown in ppgas medium and luminescence was followed during 30 h. figure 2a shows that the prrhlg activity was ~3-fold lower in p. aeruginosa paou than in pao <dig> during stationary phase . to ascertain that the results were not biased by the reporter gene and/or vector, we assayed rhlg mrna levels by quantitative reverse transcription-pcr  in plasmid-free paou and pao <dig> strains at 20 h of growth. the rhlg mrnas were 3-fold less abundant in paou than in the wildtype strain pao <dig> . these results confirmed the involvement of algu in rhlg transcription, in agreement with the sequence of the novel promoter identified by our 5′-race pcr experiment.

we did not identify the transcription start site at position − <dig>  resulting from a σ54-dependent promoter  <cit> . to rule out the involvement of σ <dig> in our strain and conditions, we used the prrhlg::luxcdabe fusion in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  which was constructed from pao <dig> by deleting a large part of the rpon gene encoding σ <dig> <cit> . the luminescence was  <dig>  to  <dig> fold lower in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> than in pao <dig> from  <dig> to 30 h of growth , indicating that σ <dig> plays indeed an important role in rhlg transcription. this was furthermore confirmed by qrt-pcr, which showed that rhlg mrnas were 5-fold less abundant in pao <dig> than in pao <dig> at 20 h of growth in ppgas . altogether, three promoters, each dependent on a distinct sigma factor , are thus involved in rhlg transcription.

the quorum sensing signal molecule c4-hsl inhibits rhlg transcription
since the putative “lux box” found in the rhlg promoter region  was proposed to be the binding site of the quorum sensing regulator rhlr  <cit> , we examined the prrhlg activity in p. aeruginosa pdo <dig> strain in which the rhli gene is inactivated  <cit> . this gene encodes the rhli enzyme responsible for the synthesis of c4-hsl which activates rhlr. the prrhlg::luxcdabe fusion led to luminescence values about  <dig> -fold higher in p. aeruginosa pdo <dig> than in pao <dig> during stationary phase , ie when c4-hsl accumulates to high concentrations in culture medium  <cit> . consistently, the rhlg mrna level assayed by qrt-pcr was  <dig> -fold fold higher in pdo <dig> than in pao <dig> at 20 h of growth . these results were surprising since they indicated that the prrhlg activity was inhibited by the rhl qs system. to further investigate this point, we first added c4-hsl at a final concentration of 10 μm to the ppgas medium when inoculating p. aeruginosa pdo <dig>  this led to luminescence levels similar to those of pao <dig> , confirming that c4-hsl has a negative effect on the prrhlg activity.

prrhlg activity is induced under hyperosmotic stress
we previously showed that hyperosmotic stress  abolishes rhamnolipid production and inhibits the transcription of genes involved in rhamnolipid synthesis  and in c4-hsl synthesis   <cit> . in ppgas culture, we observed by qrt-pcr performed on the same mrna extraction as in  <cit>  that the amount of rhlg mrna was  <dig> -fold higher after 20 h of growth in hyperosmotic condition  . this observation was confirmed using the prrhlg::luxcdabe fusion: the luminescence indeed increased until 24 h of growth in hyperosmotic condition, while it decreased in the absence of nacl from 16 h . the delay in luminescence increase observed in the presence of nacl probably corresponded to the growth lag due to the hyperosmotic condition . we previously observed that the presence of the osmoprotectant glycine betaine during hyperosmotic stress in ppgas medium did not improve growth, but at least partially prevented the down-regulation of rhlab, rhlc, and rhli genes and partially restored rhamnolipid production  <cit> . similarly, glycine betaine prevented the increase of prrhlg activity under hyperosmotic stress, the prrhlg activity being even lower in the presence of  <dig>  m nacl and glycine betaine than in regular ppgas .

to determine which of the rhlg promoters is responsible for this response to hyperosmotic condition, we used the pao <dig>  and paou  strains. no significant difference was observed when comparing the prrhlg activity in the pao <dig> and pao <dig> strains, showing that σ <dig> is not involved in prrhlg induction in hyperosmotic condition . on the opposite, the prrhlg activity remained low under hyperosmotic stress in the paou mutant , showing that algu is responsible for increasing the rhlg transcription in this environmental condition. qrt-pcr assays confirmed this result, since we observed a  <dig>  fold increase in rhlg mrna level after 20 h of growth under hyperosmotic condition in pao <dig>  but not in paou .

rhamnolipid and pqs productions are not altered in a rhlg mutant
since data from campos-garcia et al. <cit>  and from zhu and rock  <cit>  were discordant, and since our data showed that rhlg is not coordinately regulated with the other genes involved in biosurfactant biosynthesis , we constructed our own rhlg mutant  of pao <dig> in order to clarify the rhlg involvement in rhamnolipid production. rhamnolipids produced by the strains were then quantified both intra- and extra-cellularly. in paogab compared to pao <dig>  we observed a slight decrease  of extra-cellular production that complementation by rhlg did not restore. no difference at all was observed in the intracellular fraction . our results were thus concordant with  <cit> , but discordant from  <cit>  where rhamnolipid production was totally suppressed. the acp <dig> mutant used in  <cit>  was constructed by inserting a tetracycline resistance cassette within rhlg, which could have a polar effect on the expression of the downstream gene, pa <dig>  our paogab mutant was constructed using a cre-lox system which allows the construction of deletion mutant without antibiotic resistance gene to avoid altering the expression of downstream gene  <cit> . we suspected that campos-garcia et al. observations could result from a defective expression of pa <dig>  or of both rhlg and pa <dig>  we therefore constructed a pa <dig> single deletion mutant and a double rhlg/pa <dig> mutant. these two mutants displayed similar levels of rhamnolipid production as the paogab and pao <dig> strains , showing that neither rhlg nor pa <dig> is involved in rhamnolipid biosynthesis.

since β-ketoacyl-acp, a potential substrate of rhlg, is a precursor for both rhamnolipid and pqs biosynthesis  <cit> , we further examined pqs production, but no significant difference was observed between pao <dig> and paogab .

discussion
although rhamnolipid production is well described in p. aeruginosa, only few reports investigated the involvement of rhlg in this biosynthesis pathway. we focused our study on transcriptional regulation. a previous study  <cit>  identified two sigma factors involved in rhlg transcription, σ <dig> and σ <dig>  promoter mapping led us to discover an additional promoter and a third sigma factor involved: algu. since rhlg has been found to be involved in rhamnolipid production  <cit> , and since the authors described a “lux box” potentially recognized by rhlr/c4-hsl, it was suggested that rhlg was regulated similarly as the other genes involved in the rhamnolipid biosynthesis . here we found that it was not the case. whereas c4-hsl is required for rhlab transcription  <cit> , we observed that it has a negative effect on rhlg promoter activity. the “lux box” overlaps the algu-dependent promoter  and it is possible that the binding of rhlr/c4-hsl onto the “lux box” prevents the activity of this promoter. in support of this hypothesis, transcriptional fusions showed that algu is the main sigma factor for rhlg transcription during stationary phase  , when c4-hsl reaches its maximal concentration  <cit> . we also observed that rhlg promoter activity and mrna level were increased under hyperosmotic stress conditions. this result is in agreement with the above hypothesis since c4-hsl production is reduced under hyperosmotic stress  <cit> , whereas algu activity is induced in this condition  <cit> . we confirmed that the increase of rhlg promoter activity under hyperosmotic stress was dependent on algu but not on σ <dig>  by contrast, rhlab and rhlc mrna levels were reported to be lower under osmotic stress and rhamnolipid production was abolished  <cit> . it should be noted that the “lux box” found in rhlg promoter region  does not match exactly the consensus  and is closely related neither to an rhl-responsive nor to a las-specific binding sequence as defined in  <cit> . the consequence of such an unusual “lux box” is unknown, but we cannot exclude that this sequence is actually not a rhlr binding site and that rhlr/c4-hsl acts indirectly on rhlg transcription, for example by inducing the expressing of a gene encoding an unknown rhlg repressor.

consistently with the inverse regulation of rhlg and the genes involved in rhamnolipid synthesis, rhamnolipid production was not dramatically impaired in the rhlg null mutant that we constructed in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  in agreement with zhu and rock  <cit>  data. this raises the question of the rhlg function. rhlg was confirmed to be an nadph-dependent β-ketoacyl reductase, but its substrates are not carried by the acp  <cit> . since we observed an increase of rhlg transcription under hyperosmotic stress, we examined if rhlg was involved in osmotic stress response, but no difference was observed in terms of growth and survival between the rhlg mutant and its parental pao <dig> strain after osmotic stress . we furthermore tested a number of phenotypes related to rhamnolipids production , but the rhlg mutant displayed no difference compared to pao <dig> . since rhlg likely forms an operon with the pa <dig> gene of unknown function  <cit> , we furthermore constructed the single pa <dig> mutant and the double rhlg/pa <dig> mutant. they both failed to display a phenotype related to rhamnolipid production or to any of the other tested characteristics .

CONCLUSIONS
we present here the first detailed study of rhlg transcription, revealing a complex regulation since it relies on three sigma factors and is negatively affected by cell-to-cell communication molecule c4-hsl. rhlg transcription is induced by hyperosmotic stress via the ecf sigma factor algu and inversely regulated compared to the genes involved in rhamnolipid synthesis. finally, we definitely ruled out that neither rhlg nor the downstream pa <dig> gene are required for rhamnolipid production, but we failed to identify a function in which these genes are involved.
