BACKGROUND
hox genes encode a large family of closely-related transcription factors from the homeobox class that is characterised by a  <dig> amino acids region called the homeodomain  <cit> . these genes play crucial roles in the development of metazoans, principally by controlling the patterning along the anteroposterior axis in a wide variety of animals . their role in the tetrapod limb differentiation is also well-known . hox genes are usually organized in clusters whose genomic organization reflects domains of expression along the anteroposterior axis   <cit> , as well as, in some species, timing of expression during development   <cit> . members of this gene family have been reported in both bilaterians  and cnidarians , which suggests that hox genes emerged prior to the divergence between bilaterians and cnidarians  <cit> .

the parahox genes, gsx , xlox  and cdx , are closely related to the hox genes, and are also involved in developmental processes. like the hox genes, they encompass a homeodomain region and form a cluster, at least in chordates   <cit> . it is widely believed that the presence of a cluster of three parahox genes, although observed so far only in chordates, is ancestral to bilaterians  <cit> .

hox and parahox genes have been classified in homology groups, which serve as basis to study their evolutionary relationships  <cit>  and infer their origin in early metazoans  <cit> . in vertebrates, hox genes are classified in  <dig> paralogous groups   <cit>  that can themselves be grouped in broader classes, known as anterior , central  and posterior  . in some studies, the pg <dig> proteins have been proposed to form a 4th independent class , although their homeodomain shows a high similarity with that of pg <dig> proteins  <cit>  . hox genes from non-vertebrate bilaterian species have been assigned to the aforementioned classes, suggesting that these classes represent ancient types of hox genes. the parahox genes form three groups, named gsx, xlox and cdx  <cit> , yet, they are more closely related to some hox pgs than to each other. gsx genes have been reported to be closer to hox anterior group genes, xlox to pg <dig> genes, and cdx to hox posterior genes  <cit> . this has lead to the model that the hox and parahox clusters arose through the duplication of a hypothetical protohox cluster .

most studies aiming at understanding hox and parahox gene evolution used phylogenetic tree reconstruction based on multiple alignments of their homeodomain. such trees often lack resolution  <cit> , thereby preventing a clear assignment of sequences in homology groups . nodes of the trees frequently have low statistical support values that can be explained by the short length of the homeodomain  and its strong conservation  <cit> . different tree reconstruction methods may furthermore produce conflicting results, giving rise to controversial conclusions  <cit> . complementary methods, such as sequence similarity, position of the genes in the cluster and hox/parahox signatures  <cit> , thus may provide crucial information about the evolution of these genes.

hoxpred  <cit>  is a hox-dedicated program designed to classify hox protein sequences, without phylogenetic reconstructions. figure  <dig> illustrates the general approach; see  <cit>  for a full description of the method. the underlying principle is an extension of the hox signatures. however, instead of attempting to explicitly discover the few key positions that would define a given homology group, the homeodomain is considered in its entirety as a motif, and described as a generalised profile . optimal combinations of such profiles allow the classification of sequences, through a supervised classification approach  in which discriminant functions are trained to assign sequences to predefined homology groups . this technique thus differs from pattern search techniques  where a sequence either matches or not a given pattern that describes qualitatively a motif. the profiles used here are quantitative motif descriptors that are more flexible  <cit> , and that take into account amino acid substitutability for all positions of the motif in a residue-specific way i.e. substitution g to a is less penalized than g to w. the discriminant functions of hoxpred moreover allows to use the information of multiple profiles, which increases the accuracy of the predictions  <cit> . these discriminant functions finally return posterior probabilities for all possible homology groups, thereby providing confidence estimates for the predictions  <cit>  . hoxpred was originally designed for vertebrate sequences classification, and has already proven successful in clarifying the evolutionary history of the hoxc1a genes in teleost fish  <cit> .

although the origin and evolution of the hox and parahox genes have been addressed by a huge number of studies over this last decade, several fundamental and unsolved questions remain  <cit> . how did this family emerge in early metazoans? what are the evolutionary relationships between hox and parahox genes? how do cnidarian genes relate to the different classes of bilaterian hox and parahox genes? how did central and posterior genes evolve among bilaterians?

we wondered whether a non-tree-based approach could shed light on these crucial questions. in this study, we re-analyzed all published sequence datasets and several newly-sequenced genomes using new versions of the hoxpred program. the extensive evaluation of hoxpred predictions confirmed its accuracy on bilaterian sequences. its computational efficiency allowed us to simultaneously investigate  <dig> metazoan species accounting for more than  <dig>  homeodomain genes, and infer evolutionary scenarios for the emergence of homologous groups. we found that among the central hox genes, pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig> and pg <dig> were likely present in the last common ancestor of bilaterians . pg <dig> emerged in vertebrates. for the posterior hox genes, pg <dig> would have been present in urbilateria; new paralogous groups then emerged in deuterostomes . pg <dig> appears in vertebrates, suggesting that the amphioxus hox <dig> gene is not related to this pg <dig>  altogether, our results favor the independent duplication model over the 'deuterostome posterior flexibility' model alone, for the evolution of the posterior hox genes. regarding cnidarians, our results clearly indicate the presence of central hox genes, an observation which contradicts commonly-accepted views  <cit> . our analysis of parahox genes indicates that gsx is related to pg <dig> rather than to pg <dig>  across all metazoans. the parahox cdx gene would be closer to central than to posterior genes. the xlox genes from bilaterians appear mostly related to pg <dig>  while the few known cnidarian xlox are closer to the central group. the evolutionary scenario of xlox thus remains unclear. nevertheless, these results, coherent with our hox analysis, suggest three possible models for the early evolution of hox and parahox genes from an ancestral protohox cluster.

RESULTS
hoxpred, an accurate tool to classify bilaterian hox and parahox genes
we developed three new versions of hoxpred  <cit>  to study the hox and parahox genes at the scale of the metazoans . the "bilateria" version aims at classifying hox and parahox genes. the "bilateria_relaxed" and "vertebrate_relaxed" versions have been designed to study the evolutionary relationships between hox and parahox genes. these versions were constructed and evaluated as in  <cit> . the prior probability for the control  group is very high in order to avoid misclassifications. hoxpred consequently shows tendency to classify divergent sequences into the ctl group, rather than any other group  <cit> . to assess the quality of the predictions, we applied the three new versions of hoxpred on a large set of  <dig> homeodomain sequences from  <dig> non-vertebrate species spanning various bilaterian phylogenetic groups, and which include well-characterized hox and parahox genes . overall, the accuracy of all versions is high . as expected, the "bilateria" version provides an efficient and very stringent classification of hox and parahox sequences : most hox and parahox genes are correctly assigned to their class or group while non-hox sequences are consistently classified in the control group. the two "relaxed" versions also provide correct predictions for hox genes, with accuracy values higher than  <dig> .

to further investigate the evolution of hox genes and the usefulness of hoxpred for its study, we applied the three new versions of hoxpred on a comprehensive dataset of  <dig>  homeodomain sequences, from the uniprotkb database and  <dig> completely sequenced bilaterian genomes. to our knowledge, this is the first study on hox sequences conducted on such a large scale. all results are freely available from the datab'hox database  <cit> , through a friendly web interface enabling complex queries and providing links to external databases. the hoxpred program is accessible on the same website  <cit> . multiple alignments of hox and parahox sequences ordered by pgs, are also available from this website and in the additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> summarize the results obtained for the  <dig> species whose genome is completely sequenced:  <dig> lophotrochozoans  ,  <dig> ecdysozoan , and  <dig> deuterostomes . results for capitella sp. i and branchiostoma floridae are coherent with published studies  <cit> . of particular interest, we identified  <dig> hox genes in the lottia genome and found that these genes are clustered on a single scaffold and display the same orientation except for one of them, the last posterior gene similar to capitella post <dig>  similarly, the  <dig> daphnia genes are found on a single scaffold. a complex situation is found in helobdella where  <dig> hox genes are found on several different scaffolds. we also identified parahox genes . while a single parahox gene  is found in daphnia, the  <dig> types of parahox genes are found in lophotrochozoans and deuterostomes  and they are mostly organised into two- or three-genes clusters.

hoxpred therefore appears to be a suitable tool to identify hox and parahox genes and we therefore used these identifications to address unsolved questions about the evolution of these genes.

a global model for the evolution of posterior hox genes
posterior hox genes of non-vertebrate bilaterians, including deuterostomes such as cephalochordates, urochordates, and ambulacraria , can not be confidently related to specific vertebrate pg using phylogenetic analyses  <cit>  . it has been therefore proposed that the blurred relationships between hox posterior genes would be explained by an accelerated evolution rate of these genes, a process called 'deuterostome posterior flexibility'  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis suggests multiple independent duplications to shape the posterior portion of the hox clusters  <cit> . we used hoxpred to analyse the bilaterian posterior hox genes .

hoxpred assigned all amphioxus posterior genes to pg <dig> and pg <dig>  to the exception of hox <dig>  predicted as pg <dig> . the latter has not been classified into any particular homology group with phylogenetic approaches, but it was clustered with pg <dig> with low statistical values  <cit> . our own phylogenetic analyses show that the amphioxus hox <dig> clustered with pg <dig> sequences, with a high posterior probability of  <dig>  for the bayesian tree . our data therefore suggest that the amphioxus hox11- <dig> genes would have arisen from duplications of hox9- and hox10-like genes, independent to those which produced the vertebrate pg <dig> to pg <dig> posterior hox genes. hoxpred prediction for the hox <dig> gene thus brings additional support for an independent origin of the amphioxus and vertebrate hox <dig> genes  <cit> . the assignment of hox <dig> to pg <dig> suggests that a pg <dig> gene was present in the chordate ancestor. the intriguing interspersed order of the pg <dig> and pg <dig> genes  might be compatible with duplication of a hox9-hox <dig> genes segment. comparison of surrounding non-coding sequence may give further insights into the duplication events.

in the case of the urochordate oikopleura dioica, hox <dig> and hox <dig> were classified into the pg <dig> and pg <dig>  respectively, while both hox <dig> and hox <dig> were assigned to pg <dig> . these genes should be respectively renamed, e.g. hox12a and hox12b. the ambulacraria posterior genes  were all assigned to pg <dig>  hoxpred also systematically classified ecdyosozoan posterior hox sequences in pg <dig>  finally, in lophotrochozans, the predictions were ambiguous: post <dig> and post <dig> both alternated between pg <dig>  pg <dig> and ctl, likely because these sequences are quite divergent  <cit> . an alternative hypothesis is that this uncertainty reflects an affinity for both pg <dig> and pg <dig>  already present in an ancestral bilaterian pg9/pg12-like posterior gene and retained in lophotrochozoans.

hoxpred predictions of posterior sequences have strong statistical support, with posterior probabilities similarly high as anterior or central sequences . however, as many of the predictions fall in the pg <dig> and pg <dig> groups, we conducted additional statistical tests  to provide evidences that neither the pg <dig> nor pg <dig> acts as a general 'hox class' that would attract hox sequences irrespective of their real identity.

our analysis of hoxpred assignments favors the hypothesis of multiple independent duplications over the 'deuterostome posterior flexibility' hypothesis alone, and allows to propose a global model for posterior genes evolution in bilaterians . in this model, we have only considered the pg <dig> predictions for protostomes, since the pg <dig> predictions in lophotrochozoans do not seem consistent. these predictions could be artifactual and might not indicate the presence of a pg <dig> gene in the protostome ancestor. although poorly parsimonious in terms of duplication events, our model is supported by  the fact that urochordates, rather than cephalochordates, would be closer to vertebrates  <cit> , thereby challenging the view that the amphioxus hox cluster is the archetypal cluster from which aroused the vertebrate clusters - interestingly, there are more hoxpred predictions in common between vertebrates and urochordates than with cephalochordates;  many gene families, such as the bhlh family of transcription factors, have undergone multiple duplications specifically in the amphioxus  <cit> ;  deuterostome posterior flexibity has been questioned in ambulacraria  <cit> ;  the amphioxus and vertebrate hox <dig> genes do not group together in phylogenetic trees  <cit> .

the bilaterian central genes enigma
while evolutionary relationships between central genes from pg <dig> and pg <dig> across bilaterians were quite well resolved, phylogenetic approaches failed to decipher the relationships between the other three central genes, eventually classified in a single broad pg6- <dig> group  <cit> . hoxpred predictions for pg <dig> and pg <dig> were consistent with tree-based annotation . for pg6- <dig>  we found that ecdysozoan and lophotrochozoan genes are predicted into pg <dig> and pg <dig>  with a strong tendency towards ubx, abd-a, lox <dig> and lox <dig> predicted as pg <dig>  and ftz, antp and lox <dig> predicted as pg <dig> . ambulacraria and cephalochordates predictions are restricted to pg <dig>  whereas urochordates only have pg <dig> predictions. vertebrates is the only phylogenetic group having pg <dig> predictions, in addition to pg <dig> and pg <dig>  these data suggest that pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig> and pg <dig> would have been present in the last common ancestor of all bilaterians , and pg <dig> would have emerged in vertebrates. the deuterostome predictions call for caution, as they would imply a loss of pg <dig> along with an expansion of pg <dig> genes in both ambulacraria and cephalochordates, and a loss of pg <dig> in urochordates, a scenario which seems poorly parsimonious. however, urochordates have clearly lost members of many gene families  <cit>  and similar poorly parsimonious scenarios have been proposed for other genes families, for example the iroquois/irx genes  <cit> .

identification of hox genes in cnidaria
reconstructing the hox repertoire of the cnidaria/bilateria ancestor is a notorious challenge, as cnidarian 'hox-like' genes are difficult to relate to the bilaterian homologous groups with traditionnal sequence similarity-based or phylogenetic analyses. the various phylogenetic studies published so far yielded a somewhat confuse picture  <cit> . we analysed the hoxpred assignments for all the homeobox genes from the fully sequenced nematostella vectensis genome, as well as for  <dig> additional homeodomain sequences, from  <dig> other cnidarian species . using the "bilateria" version of hoxpred, we found that most cnidarian hox and parahox genes were classified as ctl, at the exception of a few anterior and gsx genes. this is not surprising given the divergent nature of the cnidarian hox and parahox genes with respect to those from bilaterians. the "relaxed" versions of hoxpred, however, allow to classify cnidarian genes. the cnidarian hox genes fall in anterior, central and posterior groups predictions which strongly contradict the commonly accepted idea of a lack of central hox genes in cnidaria  <cit> , but see alternative hypotheses  <cit> . genes predicted as central include anthox <dig> and anthox1a from the anthozoan nematostella, which have been difficult to relate to a bilaterian group of homology, considered as either central/posterior  <cit> , posterior  <cit> , cnidarian-specific  <cit>  or even non-hox  <cit> . still, they are usually considered as non-anterior hox genes  <cit> ; their classification by hoxpred in the central group is therefore in agreement with this view. predictions as central genes also encompass genes from hydrozoans  and a scyphozoan . within the anterior group, we found predictions for pg <dig> and pg <dig> that corroborate phylogenetic analyses  <cit> , but not for pg <dig> in contradiction to what has been reported in  <cit> . predictions as posterior genes, only found in hydrozoans and scyphozoans, are compatible with previous assignments  <cit> . however, most of the genes predicted as posterior by the "bilateria_relaxed" version of hoxpred are classified as central genes with the "vertebrate_relaxed" version, apart from scox <dig> that is predicted as posterior by the two "relaxed" versions. this uncertainty may reflect that these genes may have arisen from an ancestral central/posterior gene.

in summary, our analysis indicates that cnidarians would possess three to four types of hox genes, namely anterior pg <dig>  anterior pg <dig>  central, and posterior  and therefore suggest that these three to four categories of hox genes were already present in the last common ancestor of cnidarians and bilaterians .

parahox predictions: implications for the protohox models
the parahox cluster of genes has long been supposed to be the sister cluster of the hox cluster, with the gsx, xlox and cdx genes corresponding to the anterior, pg <dig> and posterior groups, respectively  <cit> . this view has been recently challenged by analyses of cnidaria data, by questioning both the cluster duplication model  <cit>  and the grouping of parahox genes with the hox homology groups  <cit> . assuming that hox and parahox are nevertheless sister clusters which derived from a single ancestral protohox cluster , we tried to determine how the parahox genes can be related to the hox genes. to do this we adopted a "hox-centric" view, i.e. we used the "relaxed" versions of hoxpred to assign parahox genes in hox pgs . our attempt to perform the reverse analysis  remained inconclusive due to the very small size of the training dataset.

we found that gsx and xlox genes were consistently predicted as anterior/pg <dig> across bilaterians. gsx is similarly predicted as anterior/pg <dig> in cnidarians and placozoans. the few xlox genes from cnidarians predicted as central could indicate that cnidarians xlox would have emerged from a central-like gene and are therefore distinct from the bilaterian pg3-derived xlox genes. alternatively, cnidarians xlox might be related to bilaterian xlox, but because of derived sequences as compared to their bilaterian counterpart, they may have been misclassified by hoxpred. our results do not support the traditional grouping of gsx with pg <dig>  but are consistent with a recent phylogenetic analysis that regroups gsx and xlox into a pg2/pg <dig> group  <cit> . cdx genes are consistently predicted in the central group, rather than in the posterior group.

taken together with our data on cnidarian hox genes, the cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor would have had a minimal hox repertoire of four genes, composed of anterior/pg <dig>  anterior/pg <dig>  central and posterior, and a minimal parahox repertoire of two genes . our results are coherent with three main protohox models that seem equally parsimonious :  a four-gene protohox cluster   <cit>  - the four genes would have been conserved in the hox cluster and two genes  would have been lost in the parahox cluster;  a three-gene protohox cluster  - previously proposed  <cit>  but where the central genes would have emerged specifically in bilaterians and not in cnidarians - one duplication would have produced the posterior and central hox genes and one loss would explain the absence of anterior/pg <dig> parahox genes;  a two-gene protohox cluster  - this is somewhat different to a previously suggested two-gene protohox model   <cit>  - in our model, the ancestral anterior/pg <dig> and central/posterior genes would have respectively given rise to the hox genes of the pg <dig>  pg <dig> and of the central, posterior groups, by two duplication events. in the three proposed models, gsx and cdx derive from ancestral anterior/pg3-like and central-like genes, respectively; xlox might have evolved from a pg3-like gene by duplication prior to the cnidarians/bilaterians split, or independently in bilaterians  and cnidarians .

CONCLUSIONS
the extensions of hoxpred presented here fulfill the needs for automatic hox classification across all bilaterians. this method is well-suited for the ever-growing amount of sequences to analyse, by combining predictive accuracy and time efficiency . hoxpred is easily accessible to the community through a user-friendly web page  <cit> . the hoxpred automatic classification for thousands of homeodomain sequences are provided in the freely available datab'hox database  <cit> . this new resource thereby offers supplementary information to the existing database homeodb  <cit> , a manually curated database of homeobox genes with annotations based on published articles - when possible, links to homeodb are provided from datab'hox.

our analyses illustrate the capacity of hoxpred to provide valuable predictions in ongoing genome projects. it is particularly appropriate for dispersed hox clusters, as it directly pinpoints the potential hox sequences. beyond its classification purposes, we showed that hoxpred can also serve to study the evolution of hox genes in metazoans. in this respect, we propose here evolutionary scenarios for several crucial questions. bilaterian posterior hox genes would have arisen from an ancestral pg <dig>  with new homology groups arising in chordates, and in ambulacraria . our model favours independent duplications, or a mixture of the two processes as suggested in  <cit> , over the "deuterostome posterior flexibility" hypothesis alone. it would be beneficial for the community to revise the nomenclature of the posterior hox genes in non-vertebrate deuterostomes, so that the number of a gene with respect to its position within the cluster would not be confused with its homology group. our evolutionary scenario for bilaterian central genes suggests that urbilateria would have possessed central genes from pg <dig>  pg <dig>  pg <dig> and pg7; pg <dig> appearing later in vertebrates. besides, our results bring additional support to the grouping of the central protostome genes into ubd-a-type and ftz/antp/lox <dig>  we also provide further insights into the notoriously controversial relationships between cnidaria and bilateria hox genes. our analysis suggests that the cnidarian/bilaterian ancestor would have had a minimal hox repertoire of four genes, from the anterior/pg <dig>  anterior/pg <dig>  central and posterior groups. hoxpred thus yields stimulating results in the context of the current views, by indicating the presence of cnidarian central gene. regarding the parahox genes, we suggest that gsx derived from an ancestral pg3-like gene, while cdx would be closer to the central  genes, which is coherent with our data on cnidarian hox genes. xlox would have independently emerged from a pg3-like gene in bilaterians and from a central-like gene in cnidarians, or alternatively emerged earlier, from a pg3-like gene. taken together, our results are consistent with three possible models for the early evolution of hox and parahox genes: a two-gene , a three-gene , or a four-gene  protohox model.
