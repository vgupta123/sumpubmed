BACKGROUND
epigenetics refers to modifications in gene expression that are controlled by heritable but potentially reversible changes in dna methylation and/or chromatin structure. nucleosome remodelling complexes twist and slide nucleosomes in an atp-dependent manner facilitating the accessibility of the dna to transcription factors. post-translational modifications of the n-terminal tails of histones within a nucleosome correlate with transcriptional regulation. variant histones that can replace canonical histones in a nucleosome between s phases in a dynamic manner, harbour distinct information to respond to dna damage. methylation at the c- <dig> position of cytosine residues in cpg dinucleotides by dna methyltransferases facilitates static long-term gene silencing and confers genome stability through repression of transposons and repetitive dna elements. perturbationof epigenetic balances may lead to alteration in gene expression, ultimately resulting in cellular transformation and tumorigenesis .

the histone proteins that package dna into chromatin play key roles in the regulation of transcription. the n-terminal tails of these proteins are subjected to several post-translational modifications such as acetylation, deacetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, sumoylation, and adp-ribosylation  <cit> . the combination of these covalent modifications gives rise to what is known as the "histone code"  <cit> . transcription becomes active when histones are acetylated by histone acetyltransferases , silenced when histones are deacetylated by histone deacetylases  and silenced or activated when methylated by histone methyltransferases   <cit> . in addition several studies have shown that chromatin modifiers regulate the expression of different sets of genes involved in tumorigenesis  <cit> .

the histone acetyltransferases ep <dig> and crebbp acetylateseveral lysine residues on histone proteins h2a, h2b, h <dig>  h <dig>  and pcaf acetylates histone h <dig>  these enzymes also acetylate several non-histone proteins such as p <dig>  β-catenin, gata and hmgi  <cit> . histone deacetylases are grouped into three classes based on homology to yeast histone deacetylases. class i histone deacetylases, _hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig> and hdac8_, are homologous to yeast rpd <dig>  class ii histone deacetylases, _hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac7a, hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and hdac11_, share homology with yeast hda <dig>  the third class of human histone deacetylases has seven members, sirt1- <dig>  withhomology to yeast sir <dig>  <cit> .

several lysine residues on h <dig> and h <dig> are subjected to methylation by lysinemethyltransferases and a few arginine residues are methylated by arginine methyltransferases. the histone lysine methyltransferases, suv39h1and suv39h <dig> are members of the suv <dig> family of set domain containing proteins  <cit> . methylation of h <dig> k <dig> by suv39h <dig> and suv39h <dig> is associated with transcriptional repression. the methylation of h <dig> k <dig> by set7/ <dig> is associated with transcriptional activation. ezh <dig>  a member of the set <dig> family of hmts, methylates h <dig> lysine  <dig>  resulting in gene silencing  <cit> . carm <dig> is a histonearginine methyltransferase and methylates arginine  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of h <dig>  <cit> .

several findings have suggested a role for hats, hdacs and hmts in cancer. ep <dig> and crebbp, are fused to mll in acute myeloid leukaemia  <cit> . ep <dig> somatic mutations coupled with the deletion of the second allele were reported in different primary tumours and cell lines  <cit> . hdac <dig> overexpression occurs in gastric cancer  <cit>  and modulates breast cancer progression  <cit> . a class  <dig> hdac, sirt <dig>  was identified as an nad-dependent p <dig> deacetylase  <cit> . insirt <dig> deficient mice, p <dig> hyperacetylation was observed and p53-dependent apoptosis was affected  <cit> . in the double knockout suv39h1/suv39h <dig> mouse the reduced level of h <dig> k <dig> methylation is associated with genomeinstability and predisposition to cancer  <cit> . another indication suggesting suv39h <dig> might be important in cancer, comes from the study revealing the interaction of suv39h <dig> with rb and also that rb mutants found in human cancers fail to bind suv39h <dig>  <cit> . overexpression of ezh <dig> is associated with progression of prostate cancer and aggressiveness of breast cancer  <cit> .

epigenetic modifications appear to occur in specific patterns during neoplastic transformation. for example, a profile of cpg island hypermethylation for each tumour type allows classification using hierarchical clustering  <cit> . a seminal report has shown that the global loss of monoacetylation and trimethylation of histone h <dig> is a common hallmark of human tumor cells  <cit> . more recently it has also been reportedthat changes in global levels of individual histone modifications assayed at the tissue level are associated with cancer and that these changes are predictive of clinical outcome in prostate cancer  <cit> .

understanding the molecular details behind epigenetics and cancer holds potentially important prospects for medical treatment, and might allow the identification of new targets for drug development  <cit> . we carried out sequence and expression analysis of selected members of the  <dig> classes of histone modifier genes: hats , hdacs , and hmts  in  <dig> samples representing  <dig> different solid tumour types. this represents the most comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of the profiles of chromatin modifier enzymes in human cancers done to date.

RESULTS
differential expression of histone modifier genes
the expression levels of the  <dig> chromatin modifier genes were analysed using qrt-pcr in  <dig> cancer cell lines  and  <dig> primary samples:  <dig> colorectal tumour/normal pairs,  <dig> renal tumour/normal pairs,  <dig> breast tumours,  <dig> normal breast tissue samples,  <dig> ovarian tumours,  <dig> glioblastomas,  <dig> bladder tumours, and  <dig> normal bladder tissue samples. to capture intra-assay variability all qrt-pcr reactions were carried out in triplicate.

the expression data analysis strategy used is shown in schematic form in figure  <dig>  normalisation of the expression levels to an endogenous housekeeping gene has been proposed  <cit>  to account for sample to sample variations. the accuracy of normalising to such an internal control gene rests mainly on the assumption that this reference gene is unregulated and that it is thus constantly expressed across samples. however, as many studies have now shown, see e.g  <cit> , traditional housekeeping genes such as gapdh do show significant variability across samples. it is therefore necessary to consider a set of candidate reference genes and to choose the most stable subset for normalisation. here we carried out rt-pcrfor a total of eight candidate housekeeping genes  across the whole sample set. the normalisation was done for tissues and cell-lines separately using a three-step procedure. first, expression values were normalised to correct for variable amplification efficiencies across genes, as previouslyreported  <cit> . second, we determined a subset of housekeeping genes that were stably expressed relative to the variability exhibited by the target genes. to do this we first computed gene stability measures by modifying the method of  <cit>  to use ratios of "efficiency corrected" ct values  <cit> . this ensured that the variability computed was less confounded by gene amplification efficiency differences across samples and not confoundedby sample loading variations  <cit> . we then used these measures to model thestability of candidate housekeeping genes using a randomised test of variance. we found that the expression level of housekeeping genes was morevariable in cell lines as compared to tissue samples. thus, whereas for thetissue samples the stable subset included all eight housekeeping genes, forcell lines the stable subset did not include b2m, hprt,and rpl <dig>  finally, to rigorously quantify the normalisation errors incurred we fitted a linear model to the expression ratios obtained throughstep  <dig> by including all stable housekeeping genes, efficiency, and replicate measurements  ×  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig>  measurements for tissues,and  ×  <dig> ×  <dig> =  <dig>  measurements for cell lines). the output of the model was an estimated matrix vg, which contained the normalised relative expression ratios by gene  and samples  . fitting a model to data as was done here provided us with an appropriate framework in which to carry out subsequent robust inferences using a bootstrapping procedure  <cit> .

one important aspect was to determine which genes could be used to differentiate between tumour and normal tissues based on expression analysis . inspection of the data from the paired and unpaired tissues suggested for example differential expression of hdac <dig>  sirt <dig>  suv39h <dig> and ezh <dig> . to test this, we used the non-parametric wilcoxon rank sum test as it makes no assumptions about the distribution of expression values within tissue types and is robust to possible unrepresentative outliers in the tissue sets. to further check therobustness of the p-values from the rank sum test we used the bootstrappingresidual method  <cit>  to model noise due to unstable housekeeping gene expression. we therefore generated an additional  <dig> vg matrices representing perturbations around the estimated vg. a robustness measure for each tumour/normal tissue pair p-value was then obtained as thenumber of times  the test was significant at a  <dig>  significance level . this showed that colorectal tumours were distinguished as a group from normal colorectal tissues by the expression of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac7a, sirt <dig>  and suv39h <dig>  in pairwise comparisons, all colorectal cancers showed significantly lower expression  of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  and sirt <dig> than their respective normals, except for two colorectal tumours showing higher expression of hdac <dig>  higher expression of hdac7a and suv39h <dig> was observed in most colorectal tumours. however,  <dig> colorectal tumours showed lower expression of hdac7a. renal tumours were distinguished as a group from normal renal tissues by the expressionof ezh <dig> . in pairwise comparisons with their matched normal tissue all renal tumours expressed higher levels of ezh <dig>  breast tumours were distinguished as a group from normal breast tissues by the expression of ezh <dig>  crebbp and hdac <dig>  although the number of normal breast samples available was small the analysis is robust statistically and it is reassuring to see thatfor the single gene  out of the  <dig> that are discriminatory and for which independent data exists the results are concordant with our findings   <cit> . bladder tumours could not be distinguished as a group from the bladder normal tissues based on the individual expression of any of the genes analysed. further insight however was obtained by application of independent component analysis  <cit>  .

histone modifier genes have tissue-type specific patterns of expression
we also noted what appeared to be distinct expression profiles for each tissue type . to investigate this further we clustered the samples based on the similarity of expression across genes and then visualized the data in a matrix format. we first used unsupervised approaches because we were interested in discovering novel associations without influence from prior knowledge. unsupervised algorithms that have been used extensively for expression analysis include hierarchical clustering  <cit>  and k-means  <cit> . however, both have limitations: k-means is biased as it requires the number of clusters to be specified in advance whereas hierarchical clustering does not allow this number to be rigorouslyinferred. the problem of inferring the number of clusters has been addressed  <cit>  in the context of a gaussian mixture model. there the bayesian information criterion  was used to infer the number of clusters. an alternative to bic is provided by the variational bayesian approach  <cit> . this approach implements an ensemble learning algorithm for the cluster parameters and provides a rigorous framework in which to infer the optimal number of clusters  <cit>  . moreover, in common with the method in  <cit>  it provides a framework in which to test the robustness ofthe clusters to noise. prior knowledge may be easily incorporated, althoughfor this unsupervised analysis we have implemented a version with complete uninformative priors. the results of unsupervised clustering using the ensemble-learning algorithm as applied to the normalised expression matrix vg are summarised in table  <dig>  on the set of  <dig> target genes, the algorithm predicted the presence of six clusters . one included most breast samples, a second included the renal and bladder samples, and athird included most colorectal samples. the ovarian samples were distributed between two main clusters , one of which shared with glioblastomas. we compared this clustering pattern with the one obtained using hierarchical clustering and found that the patterns were mostly concordant .

new insights were obtained using independent component analysis  <cit> , whichis described in detail in methods. the aim here was two-fold. one goal was to find in an unsupervised manner data projections that may be of specific biological interest and to find the major players  defining these projections. secondly, ica allows the inherent dimensionality of the data set to be inferred via a dimensional reduction step in which gaussian noise-like dimensions are filtered out  <cit> . applying a maximum likelihood version of ica we were able to infer only seven robust projections or modes. thus, ica removed a five dimensional gene subspace for which the data variance was smallest and along which the data distribution was gaussian. out of the seven modes, four were particularly interesting  clearly discriminating the various tumour types from each other or from their normal counterparts. for example, ml-ic <dig> showed a projection that separated tumour from normal tissues across four different tissue types, which we verified with a wilcoxon rank sum test . taken together with its corresponding projection along genes this mode defines a pattern of relative over-and-underactivation of the twelve genes that discriminates tumours from normals and that may have biological significance. similarly, the other modes  suggested that sirt <dig> and crebbp to be among the top genes discriminating the various tissue types. an ensemble learning clustering over the four genes with the best signal tonoise ratios  confirmed that even with a small number of genes we could separate tissue types from each other.

the unsupervised clustering results strongly suggest that cancer tissues may be distinguished from each other on the basis of the expression profiles of  <dig> or less chromatin modifier genes. many classification algorithms exist and have been applied extensively to gene expression data . because of the relatively large number of classes  and the small number of predictors  our classification problem is well suited for a parametric mixture model based approach  <cit> . here we adapted the variational bayesian gaussian mixturemodel to the supervised setting. to ensure robustness of the results to noise we restricted the classifier to be in a seven dimensional gene subspace spanned by the genes with the best overall signal to noise ratios . two methods of internal cross-validation were used to partition the sample set into training and test sets. in the leave-one-out method, one sample from each tissue type was selected at random and placed in the test set. in the second method we placed 20% of randomly selected samples from each type in the test set. for a given classifier we learned from the training set the meansand variances of the clusters associated with each tissue type. this was done on a tissue-type basis. we then assigned the test samples to a tissue type using a linear discriminant classifier . the error rates of the classifier on the training and test sets were recorded. this was then repeated for  <dig> different randomly selected partitions of the sample set into training and test subsets. the average and standard deviation of theerror rates over these  <dig> runs were then computed. finally, all these steps were repeated for all possible numbers and combinations of genes out of the initial set of seven. that is, for each possible subset of  containing at least two genes  we did the analysis described above recording the average error rate on the test set together with its standard deviation . from the classificationresults  we found that based on this data set we can very accurately predict tissue type on the basis of very few genes. with as few as three genes  we can obtain prediction rates over 80%. moreover, we can see  that in fact many optimal classifiers exist. one possible choice would be the classifier , which gave averageprediction rates of 87% and 86% for the training and test sets, respectively. using all  <dig> target genes in the classifier we obtained 92% ± 1% and 86% ± 5% prediction rates for the training and test sets, respectively. we found however this last result not to be robust to noise arising from non-ideal housekeeping gene conditions which is why we focused on the genes with best signal-to-noise ratios. to test our classifier further we validatedour results against  <dig> independent breast tumour samples, which became available after our initial analysis. we found that with the optimal two-gene classifier  about 80% of these independent breast tumour samples could be correctly classified. this classifier's prediction rate on the training set was 76%  and 74%  respectively.

even though the accuracy and reproducibility of microarray experiments is questionable, particularly, when the focus is on a small number of genes, we decided to test our results further by studying the expression profiles of our chromatin modifier genes in an external independent microarray data set  <cit> . out of the  <dig> histone modifier genes studied using rt-pcr there were  <dig> that were profiled in this microarray study  across many different cancer types including  <dig> breast,  <dig> renal,  <dig> colorectal and  <dig> ovary samples. we first applied the wilcoxon rank sum test to see whether the  <dig> genes profiled in  <cit>  could discriminate any of these four tissue types from each other . we found that many of the genes were discriminatory, yet when compared with our study the number of genes discriminating any given pair of tissue types was significantly smaller . thus, for a given pair of tissue types thenumber of discriminatory genes varied from  <dig> to  <dig> , whilst for our study this number varied from  <dig> to  <dig> . applying, on the microarray data, the same classification algorithm and internal cross validation as before, showed that the genes were not able toconsistently classify samples according to tissue type , or with our optimal 4-gene classifier ). however, when we considered classifying only two tissue types at a time, we obtained much better classification rates. thus, using internal cross validation with a 20% test set partition and using the discriminatory genes as classifier genes we found in some cases excellent prediction rates. for example, usingthe classifier  we obtained 94% prediction rates for discriminating colorectal from renal tumour samples. we confirmed this by unsupervised clustering which clearly separated colorectal from renal tumours . in summary, theseanalyses support the existence of tissue-specific patterns of expression ofchromatin modifier genes.

mutations of hdac <dig>  suv39h <dig>  and suv39h <dig> in epithelial cancers are rare
we also screened hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  suv39h <dig>  and suv39h <dig> for mutations in  <dig> cancer cell lines and  <dig> primary tumours. themutations and sequence alterations identified in these genes are summarizedin tables  <dig> and  <dig> 

hdac <dig> was analysed by sscp, and a silent polymorphism was identified in one breast tumour sample.

hdac <dig> was analysed with both sscp and dhplc. a single nucleotide deletion was found in a colorectal cancer cell line , causing a frameshift starting at amino acid  <dig> of the protein and resulting in the addition of  <dig> amino acids to its c-terminal. a insertion of a cag triplet was identified in the 5'utr at nucleotide  <dig>  in 18% of the cancer samples. this insertion was shown to be germline in all samples for which matched normal dna was available for testing. this 5'utr alteration was found using capillary electrophoresis in only 10% of  <dig> normal dna controls . no correlation was foundbetween the cag insertion and expression levels of hdac <dig> . in addition four cancer samples with intronic polymorphisms were also identified.

suv39h <dig> was analysed by sscp and capillary electrophoresis based heteroduplex analysis . a nonsense mutation 862c>t causing the disruption of the protein's set domain , was found in one ovariancancer cell line . a silent polymorphism and an intronic sequence variant were also identified.

suv39h <dig> was screened by sscp. an insertion of a single t in the 5'utr  was found in a primary breast tumour. this alteration wassomatic. a missense sequence alteration, r74q , was identified in 4% of the cancer samples. this alteration was proven to be germline in the  <dig> primary tumours where normal tissue was available for testing, and represents a probable polymorphism. two silent polymorphisms were also identified.

discussion
the rationale to study the alterations of chromatin modifier genes in cancer samples and their respective normal tissues seemed obvious to us given the biology and the previous indications for their involvement in tumorigenesis. the mutational analysis reported here, and previous work by our group and others, shows that inactivating mutations of histone modifiers are rare, although ep <dig> and crebbp are targets of chromosomal translocations in human leukaemias and ep <dig> and crebbp are an uncommon target of mutations in epithelial cancers  <cit> . a finding that needs confirmation in a larger association study isthe observation that the cag insertion identified in the 5'utr of hdac <dig> could be associated with cancer predisposition.

the expression profile of selected chromatin remodelling genes from the three classes of histone modifiers was analysed in a large sample panel. this represents the most comprehensive analysis of the expression alterations of these important genes in human cancers and their corresponding normal tissues. the analysis was done rigorously with normalization of expression levels in comparison with several stable housekeeping genes and in relation to a universal reference rna. by fittinga linear regression model to the data we could quantify the residual error due to unstable housekeeping gene expression and determine that the expression levels of the  <dig> chromatin modifier genes varied significantly across samples. the main findings of the analysis were: 1- that there are tissue-specific histone-modifier gene expression signatures ; 2- that for certain tissue types there are significant expression changes between normal and malignant cells;and 3- that expression patterns in cell lines are frequently significantlydifferent from the corresponding primary tumours.

the existence of characteristic histone modifier gene expression signaturesin different tissues is a remarkable finding particularly when taken in thecontext of the recent reports of global and characteristic changes in histone modification in cancer  <cit> . ensemble learning and hierarchical clustering algorithms applied on the normalized expression ratios of the  <dig> chromatin remodelling genes successfully separated the tumour samples according to their tissue types . we verified that the clusters obtained using the ensemble learning algorithm are robust to both the algorithm initialisation point and the error due to unstable housekeeping gene expression. this was done rigorously by bootstrapping residuals in thelinear model  <cit>  and building consensus groups over a large number  of clustering runs. as few as five genes  were informative enough to group the samples successfully according to tissue type . in an independent microarray data set we found that these chromatin modifier genes were also able to discriminate samples according to tissue type, although the degree of discrimination was much smaller. these findings suggest a mechanistic link between the gene expression changes reported here and global tumour-specific histone modifications reported by others.

the expression levels of some of the genes could also be used to distinguish between tumour and the respective normal tissue. hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac7a, sirt <dig>  and suv39h <dig> expression profiles were distinctive for colorectal cancers and normal colorectal mucosa. ezh <dig> expression was found to be informative in distinguishing renal tumour and normal renal tissue pairs, and also breast tumours from breast normal tissues. breast tumours and normals were also distinguished by the expression profile of hdac <dig> and crebbp. using ica we alsofound a pattern of relative expression over all  <dig> genes  that is able to discriminate tumours from normals acrossfour different tissue types . these findings raise the prospect that there will be a therapeutic index when using drugs that target these enzymes in the clinic.

comparison of normalized expression ratios of tumours with their relevant cancer cell lines revealed significant differences highlighting some of theproblems of using cell lines as models of cancer . breast cell lines showed downregulation of hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  hdac <dig>  ezh <dig>  ep <dig>  and pcaf compared to breast tumours. crebbp and suv39h <dig> upregulation was observed in breast cell lines compared tobreast tumours. colorectal cell lines showed sirt <dig>  ezh <dig>  pcaf underexpression and suv39h <dig> overexpression compared to colorectal tumours. pcaf downregulation was seen in ovarian cell lines compared to ovarian tumours. this raises problematic questions about using cell lines to model primary tumours, for example when doing hdac inhibitor compound screening.

chromatin remodelling genes and their involvement in transcriptional regulation has been the focus of previous studies although none as systematic as what we report here. overexpression of hdac <dig> has been seen in gastric and breast cancers  <cit> . in our study we did not observe significant expression changes of hdac <dig> when comparing tumour and normal tissue samples, except for colorectal cancers. ezh <dig> overexpression was previously seen in prostate cancer  <cit> . subsequently, it was shown that ezh <dig> overexpression was associated with the aggressivenessof breast cancer  <cit> . our results confirm that overexpression of ezh <dig> is found in breast tumours compared to the normal breast samples and shows for the first time ezh <dig> overexpression in renal tumours. overexpression of hdac <dig> was recently reported in colon cancer  <cit> . in our series hdac <dig> overexpression was observed in 50% of colorectal tumours compared to their normal pairs.

CONCLUSIONS
our findings have implications for tumour biology, differences in histone modifications between tumour types and the application of histone-modification-altering drugs. ongoing work aims at correlating histone modifier gene expression with global histone modification patterns and obtaining a more systematic analysis of all known histone modifiers enzymes using custom gene arrays.
