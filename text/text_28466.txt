BACKGROUND
hepatitis b virus  is an etiological agent of acute and chronic liver disease. despite the introduction of hbv vaccination programs in the last decade, hepatitis b remains a largely disseminated disease, with an estimated  <dig> million people chronically infected around the world, and over  <dig> billion people who have already been infected with the virus. it is estimated that between  <dig> and  <dig> million people die annually as a consequence of the infection  <cit> .

based on sequence divergence in the entire genome exceeding 8%, hbv is classified into eight genotypes   that are related to their geographical origin. most genotypes have been recently divided into subgenotypes with distinct virological and epidemiological properties. in addition, recombination among hbv genotypes increases the variability of hbv  <cit> . genotype a is present in europe, india, africa and americas. genotype a is subdivided into three subgroups or subgenotypes . isolates belonging to subgroup aa/a <dig> have been identified in populations and descendents of african countries  <cit> . subgenotype ae/a <dig> has a european origin, whereas subgenotype a <dig> has been identified in central and west africa  <cit> . genotypes b and c are predominant in china, japan and southeast asia. genotype d is widespread, predominating in the mediterranean area and in the middle east region. genotype e appears to derive from west africa. genotype f is found in the aboriginal populations of the central and south america. genotype h has been described in mexico and central america  <cit> . genotype g has been first identified in france and the united states  <cit> , and recently detected in mexico  <cit> . it seems that genotype g prevails in restricted areas in the world, possibly disseminating via particular routes of transmission  <cit> . genotype g has been found in a relatively high frequency  in mexican men who have sex with men  <cit> . genotype g is usually coinfected with genotype a  <cit>  or, less frequently, with genotype h  <cit> . hbv genotype g is distinct from the genomes of the other seven genotypes in that it possesses a 36-nt insertion at the 5' end of the core  gene and translational stop codons at positions  <dig> and  <dig> in the pre-c region, preventing hbeag synthesis  <cit> . despite these stop codons, patients infected with genotype g have been found positive for hepatitis b e antigen   <cit> . this could be explained by the fact that genotype g is commonly found in coinfection with genotype a. however, at least one case of monoinfection with genotype g alone has been described  <cit> . this could suggest that hbeag is dispensable for viral replication. when searched for, genotype g has not been identified in several countries, and seems to be an extremely rare genotype in japan  <cit> .

in brazil, genotypes a, d and f are the most prevalent  <cit> . in previous studies conducted in the general brazilian- or in the afro-brazilian population, subgenotype a <dig> was the most frequent subgenotype  <cit> .

lamivudine is an oral nucleoside analogue inhibiting the reverse transcriptase activity of hiv and hbv  <cit> . this drug is widely used in the treatment of hepatitis b and as part of the treatment of hiv infection. a period of one year of therapy in hbeag positive patients has been associated with hbeag loss in 17–33% of patients and hbeag seroconversion rates of 16–18%  <cit> . hbeag seroconversion is the result of a profound suppression of viral replication, since it has only been found in patients with a reduction in hbv dna to < <dig> copies/ml  <cit> . the major limitation in the use of lamivudine is the selection of resistant mutations that may arise and accumulate during therapy. these mutations usually affect the ymdd motif located in the c domain of the hbv reverse transcriptase , by replacement of a methionine residue at position  <dig> to either valine  or isoleucine   <cit> . the proportion of patients in whom ymdd variants are detectable increases with time on lamivudine therapy, rising from around 15–25% after one year of treatment to 70% by four years  <cit> . in addition, a second lamivudine resistance mutation , located in the b domain of rt, has been identified  <cit> . this second mutation is associated with prolonged lamivudine treatment. such double mutations have notably been reported in studies performed with hiv-hbv co-infected patients  <cit> . more than 90% of the hiv-hbv co-infected patients under lamivudine treatment display the double resistant mutation rtl180m/rtm204v  <cit> .

hepatitis b acute exacerbation may occur after the appearance of ymdd mutants  <cit> , accompanied by a rapid increase of viral load and serum aminotransferase levels  <cit> . such exacerbations appear to be more severe than those occurring during the natural course of wild type hbv chronic infection  <cit> . at present, management of patients with lamivudine mutations rests on addition or replacement with other antiviral agents as adefovir dipivoxil or entecavir, which may effectively suppress the ymdd mutants  <cit> .

the aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence of hbv dna and viral load variations in patients receiving lamivudine for a long period for hbv treatment, to characterize hbv genotypes, and to determine the frequency and nature of lamivudine resistance mutations. furthermore the entire nucleotide sequences of three genotype g isolates recovered from this work were determined.

RESULTS
serological patterns and distribution of hbv genotypes
among  <dig> hbsag positive patients under long-term lamivudine treatment, only four  were tested negative for hbv dna by nested pcr. all four were hiv negative, one was hbeag positive and three were anti-hbe positive . thirteen patients, all men, were co-infected with hiv,  <dig> of them belonging to risk groups associated with sexual transmission .

nd, not determined

the genotype/subgenotype distribution of the hbv isolates showed a predominance of genotype a, subgenotype a <dig> . noteworthy, three isolates belonged to genotype g, a genotype which had never been described in brazil. genotypes a <dig>  c, d and f were also identified.

the deduced amino acid sequences of the hbv dna polymerase demonstrated that 20/ <dig>  isolates had lamivudine resistance mutations. the proportion of mutants varied from 60% to 100%, depending on the genotype, with the exception of genotype d, for which none of the three isolates was mutated. fifteen patients showed the well-known double rtl180m/rtm204v mutation. two others  displayed a third mutation  related to lamivudine resistance  <cit> . at last, three patients displayed a single  or double  mutation leading to the yidd motif.

patients infected with isolates showing lamivudine resistance mutations had hbv loads varying from  <dig> ×  <dig> to  <dig> ×  <dig> copies/ml . interestingly, values not very different  were found in treated patients without mutations. median values of virus load were significantly higher in patients with hbeag  than in patients with anti-hbe antibodies  .

failure to lamivudine treatment  was evaluated by medical staff based in rapid increase of serum alanine aminotransferase  levels, sometimes accompanied by detection of a rebound of hbv load. there was a good correlation between phenotypic resistance and detection of lamivudine mutations. indeed, 20/ <dig>  patients showing phenotypic resistance displayed lamivudine resistant mutations, whereas 8/ <dig>  who had no medical signs did not .

complete sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of genotype g isolates
as mentioned above, 3/ <dig> patients were infected with the rare hbv genotype g . all three were men who reported sexual relationships with men. two of them were co-infected with hiv and were hbeag positive: patient 09-hgg had very high levels of hbeag, and was negative for anti-hbe, whereas patient 05-hgg had low levels of hbeag and anti-hbe. the third patient  was anti-hbe positive .

hbv/g has been commonly found in patients coinfected with an hbv isolate belonging to genotype a  <cit> . whether the three hbv/g isolates from this study were associated with an hbv isolate belonging to another genotype was evaluated by pcr-rflp analysis of the pre-s/s genomic region. digestion of pcr products derived from sample 09-hgg with ecori restriction endonuclease  showed the presence of two hbv populations, one without ecori site  and the other with one ecori site . a similar experiment performed with bamhi restriction enzyme  suggested a coinfection of patient 09-hgg with three hbv isolates, including g and a <dig>  furthermore, restriction digests of the two other hbv/g isolates from this study  showed the presence of additional, faint dna bands, not explainable by incomplete digestion, but suggesting the occurrence of coinfection with low titers of hbv genotypes other than g. such bands were not observed with isolates not belonging to genotype g.

complete nucleotide sequences of the three hbv/g isolates  were determined. all three had  <dig> bp and showed a 36-nt insertion at the 5' end of the c gene, a 3-nt deletion in the pre-s <dig> region, and stop codons at positions  <dig> and  <dig> of the pre-core region, i.e. all features characteristics of genotype g  <cit> . phylogenetic trees based on the complete genome  and on entire pre-s/s, pre-core/core and x  regions confirmed the classification of isolates 09-hgg, 05-hgg and 06-hac into genotype g. it was observed that the three brazilian g  isolates were divergent between them and from those described before. hbv/g-br isolates had a mean sequence divergence  higher than that observed between the eight previously described hbv/g isolates from other geographic regions . such a divergence was even higher  when pre-s/s region alone was analyzed. genotypes f and h were the genotypes  most distant from the hbv/g-br isolates .

sequence divergences are expressed in percents

deduced amino acid sequences of pre-s <dig> region were well conserved among all g isolates. the three g isolates belonged to subtype adw <dig> . pre-s <dig> and s regions of isolates 06-hac and 09-hgg displayed several aminoacid variations that are present in the sequence consensus of genotypes h and f, whereas isolate 05-hgg showed aminoacid variations related to genotype a . variations t <dig>  and m <dig>  were observed in all three hbv/g-br. the last one resulted from the lamivudine resistance mutation at rtl180m position.

discussion
lamivudine resistance is due to aminoacid substitutions in the ymdd motif of the rt domain of the hbv polymerase. the resistance occurs by replacement of a methionine residue at position rt <dig> by either valine  or isoleucine , accompanied or not by a substitution at position rt <dig>  <cit>  and more rarely by a substitution at position rt <dig>  <cit> . the occurrence of mutations rtl180m and rtv173l has been associated with prolonged lamivudine treatment  <cit> . single mutants in the ymdd motif  replicate substantially more slowly in vitro than the wild type. mutations at positions rt <dig> and rt <dig> may thus act as compensatory changes which partially restore the replication fitness of the virus. the triple mutation rtv173l/rtl180m/rtm204v/i results in concomitant amino acid substitutions e164d and i195m in the small s protein. it has been shown that this triple mutant has a reduced in vitro affinity to anti-hbs antibodies, similar to what occurs with the hepatitis b vaccine escape mutant g145r  <cit> .

here, most patients under prolonged lamivudine treatment displayed hbv dna in serum. lamivudine resistant mutations were observed in 67% of the cases, while 33% did not display recognized resistance mutations. in a previous study, performed with hiv infected patients with occult hbv infection , the group of patients without resistance mutations had a lower mean viral load than patients with resistance mutations  <cit> . however, in the present study, where all patients were hbsag positive, no significant viral load differences were observed between those with and without lamivudine resistance mutations. in another study involving hbsag positive, hiv infected patients, almost 50% who were hbv dna positive did not display lamivudine resistance mutations. furthermore, high hbv load was observed in at least one of these patients  <cit> . more detailed investigations of these patients, including adherence to treatment and eventual presence of quasispecies with resistant strains as minor populations, should be conducted. understanding the circumstances and the molecular mechanisms leading to the circulation in relative high titers of hbv isolates with or without lamivudine resistance after prolonged utilization of the drug, may help to guide future therapies.

recent studies have suggested that the rate of lamivudine resistance was higher in patients infected with hbv genotype a than in those with genotype d  <cit> . here it was not possible to correlate lamivudine resistant mutations and genotype. large surveys should be conducted to clarify the role of hbv genotype in the response of treatment.

the three hbv/g isolates described here displayed lamivudine resistance mutations. in previous studies, no particular association has been made between hbv/g and lamivudine resistance. hbv/g was discovered in san francisco  <cit> , where a large community of homosexual men lives. in a recent study conducted in mexico, hbv/g was found exclusively in men who have sex with men  <cit> . here, the three hbv/g isolates infected homosexual men. this supports the hypothesis of a major dissemination of hbv/g isolates in homosexual men.

hbv/g displays two stop codons in the precore region, abolishing hbeag synthesis  <cit> . despite this, a large proportion of patients infected with hbv/g are positive for hbeag. the reason is that hbv/g is usually found in coinfection with hbv isolates from other genotypes, mainly genotype a  <cit> . until recently, it was uncertain whether hbv/g could be found in monoinfections. strong evidence of hbv/g monoinfection was obtained in  <dig> by chudy and colleagues  <cit> . hbv/g replication increased markedly when coinfected with hbv isolates from other genotypes  <cit> . the dynamics of co-infection of hbv/g with other genotypes would indicate that coinfection with genotype a is much more advantageous for enhanced replication than that occurring with other genotypes, including genotype c. indeed, coinfection with hbv/a is frequent in individuals infected with hbv/g  <cit> . here, the three hbv/g infected patients displayed different hbeag/anti-hbe status. two were hbeag positive. one of them  was strongly positive while the other  has low titres of both hbeag, and anti-hbe antibodies. the third sample was anti-hbe positive. despite this variability, all three hbv/g samples seem to be cases of coinfection. as stated before  <cit> , monoinfections should produce low serum hbv dna titers, almost at the limit of detection. here it was possible to amplify complete hbv/g genomes, that could hardly be done in the case of hbv/g monoinfection. hbv/g isolates of the present work displayed lamivudine mutations. to determine if there exists an association between brazilian hbv/g and lamivudine mutations, large surveys should be conducted among men who have sex with men.

the three hbv/g isolates characterized here had mean sequence variations  higher than those  observed between hbv/g isolates from other geographic regions. phylogenetic trees based on pre-s/s, pre-core/core and x regions confirmed the classification of isolates 09-hgg, 05-hgg and 06-hac into genotype g. in the case of isolate 05-hgg, the presence of amino acids characteristics of genotype a in pre-s <dig> and s regions does not allow excluding the occurrence of a recombination event. nucleotide sequencing of individual clones will be necessary to test this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
a high proportion  of long term lamivudine treated patients were hbv dna positive. most samples displayed recognized lamivudine resistant mutations with viral loads sufficiently high to be transmissible. genotypes c and g, rarely or never detected before in south america, were identified. disparities in routes of transmission  and in pathogenic properties  might explain the presence of these genotypes in the population studied. all three hbv/g isolates detected here displayed lamivudine mutations and showed large genetic variations between them. large surveys conducted in the population of men who have sex with men should be useful to better characterize hbv genotype g.
