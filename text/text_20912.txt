BACKGROUND
plants are exposed to an innumerable number of pathogenic organisms on a daily basis. however, because of immunity mechanisms only a few pathogens can infect and cause diseases in a particular crop species. one of the less understood immunity mechanisms is nonhost resistance , exhibited by all members of a plant species against non adapted pathogens
 <cit> . the main nhr mechanisms were thought to be 1) incompatibility of non adapted pathogen with the physiology of nonhost plants and 2) inability of non adapted pathogens to overcome the plant defenses
 <cit> . the first gene known to confer arabidopsis nhr against a non adapted bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola, is nonhost <dig>  which encodes a glycerol kinase
 <cit> . nho <dig> has also been shown to play an important role in the expression of gene-specific resistance against a bacterial pathogen
 <cit> .

nhr acts in two layers against the biotrophic fungal pathogens
 <cit> . the first layer of nhr suppresses the invasion by non adapted pathogens at the pre-haustorial level. three nhr genes, pen <dig>  pen <dig> and pen <dig>  required for penetration resistance of arabidopsis against the non adapted barley biotrophic fungal pathogen, blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei have been isolated
 <cit> . these genes act at the prehaustorial stage of the pathogen invasion
 <cit> . pen <dig> encodes a soluble n-ethylmalemide sensitive attached receptor  protein, which is involved in vesicle fusion and exocytosis of toxic compounds to the pathogen infection sites
 <cit> . pen <dig> encodes a glycosyl hydrolase, which has been localized to the peroxisomes
 <cit> . pen <dig> encodes an atp-binding cassette  protein of the plasma membrane
 <cit> . cytological studies have demonstrated that pen <dig> and pen <dig> work together to generate and transport toxic chemicals into the infection sites
 <cit> . the first layer of nhr prevents the biotrophic fungal pathogens from penetration and development of feeding structures, haustoria. fungal pathogens that overcome the first layer of nhr encounter a post-haustorial defense mechanism. some of the genes involved in the second layer of nhr in arabidopsis are eds <dig>  pad <dig> and sag <dig> that are involved in plant defenses
 <cit> . downstream antagonistic defense pathways regulated by salicylic acid  and the jasmonic acid  are activated upon infection with biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens, respectively
 <cit> . sa and ja pathways are shown to be involved in the expression of nonhost resistance against the cowpea rust, uromyces vignae, in arabidopsis
 <cit> . similarly, studies of mutants lacking pen <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> established that sa and ja pathways are also involved in the expression of nonhost resistance in arabidopsis against the soybean pathogen phakopsora pachyrhizi that causes the asian soybean rust
 <cit> .

recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns  of non adapted pathogens by pamp recognition receptors  triggers the pamp-triggered immunity  in nonhost species
 <cit> . recent studies have shown that pti plays a major role in nhr
 <cit> . both chemical and physical barriers induced by pti restrict non-adapted pathogens from invading nonhost species. physical barriers include callose deposition at the infection sites and preformed barriers such as waxy coating on leaves. chemical barriers include deposition of various reactive oxygen species  such as hydrogen peroxide and phenolic compounds at the infection site
 <cit> .

the plant responses to pathogenic invasions can be classified into two broad groups, pti and the effector-triggered immunity  activated by strain-specific effectors. both pti and eti play roles in providing nonhost resistance of plant species against non-adaptive or nonhost pathogens. it is speculated that pti and eti play an increasingly major and a minor role, respectively, in conferring nonhost resistance as the evolutionary distance between the nonhost and the nonhost pathogen species widens
 <cit> . conversely, eti and pti play an increasingly major and a minor role, respectively, in expression of nonhost resistance as the evolutionary distance between the nonhost and nonhost pathogens reduces.

soybean  is one of the most important oil seed crops, a major source of livestock feed and an important biodiesel crop. unfortunately, soybean is also a host of many pathogens that cause several serious diseases resulting in an estimated annual yield loss of $ <dig>  billion dollars
 <cit> . in the united states, the estimated annual soybean yield losses just from the oomycete pathogen, p. sojae, have been valued to be over  <dig> million dollars
 <cit> . although various rps  genes are utilized in generating phytophthora resistant soybean cultivars
 <cit> , resistance conferred by these genes is effective only against a set of p. sojae races and is not durable. partial resistance governed by quantitative trait loci  confers broad-spectrum resistance against p. sojae races in soybean. however, the level of partial resistance is not adequate enough to prevent significant crop losses
 <cit> . thus, it is essential to identify and use nhr mechanisms to provide soybean with broad-spectrum and durable resistance against this pathogen. as a first step towards achieving this goal, we have applied a forward genetic approach to identify and map the arabidopsis thaliana nhr gene, pss <dig>  which provides resistance against the oomycete pathogen p. sojae. pss <dig> is also required for immunity of arabidopsis against the fungal pathogen, fusarium virguliforme that causes the sudden death syndrome  in soybean.

RESULTS
arabidopsis pen1- <dig> mutant, but not nho <dig> mutant, is penetrated to single cells by the soybean pathogen p. sojae
arabidopsis nho <dig> and pen1- <dig> mutants are defective in nhr mechanisms against the bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. phaseolicola <cit>  and the powdery mildew fungus, blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei <cit> , respectively. we investigated if the soybean pathogen p. sojae infects either of the two mutants. ten-day-old seedlings grown in autoclaved double distilled water were inoculated with p. sojae zoospore suspensions and incubated for two days in the dark at 22°c. the inoculated seedlings were then stained with trypan blue dye and observed under a light microscope
 <cit> . the pathogen did not penetrate either the wild-type ecotype columbia- <dig>  or the nho <dig> mutant . p. sojae however penetrated single cells in pen1- <dig> . these results indicated that in the pen1- <dig> mutant, the pre-haustorial nhr against p. sojae is compromised.

identification of phytophthorasojaesusceptible  putative mutants
we mutagenized pen1- <dig>  compromised in pre-invasive immunity against p. sojae, with ethyl methane sulfonate  to identify mutants that are compromised in post-invasive immunity mechanisms. over  <dig>  m <dig> plants were planted and m <dig> seeds of these plants were harvested individually. three hundred and seventy-nine randomly selected m <dig> families were grown to score for the chlorophyll mutants, a marker for determining the extent of ems-induced mutation. about 5% of the families segregated for albino plants , which suggested that the mutant population contained sufficient random point mutations and was suitable for screening. approximately ≥  <dig> seedlings of each m <dig> family were grown aseptically in 24-well microtiter plates in sterile water at 22°c for  <dig> days before inoculating with p. sojae zoospores. following inoculation, seedlings were incubated for two days at 22°c in the dark, and then seedlings were stained with trypan blue for identifying putative mutants via staining of dead infected cells
 <cit> . from screening  <dig>  m <dig> families, we identified  <dig> putative mutants that were penetrated by p. sojae to multiple cells. the putative mutants were named as phytophthorasojaesusceptible  <dig>  through pss <dig>  subsequently, a detached leaf inoculation technique, previously reported for soybean, was applied in screening the putative mutants to identify the homozygous mutant plants
 <cit> . we have applied a mapping approach in classifying these putative mutants. a homozygous mutant m <dig> family  of the putative mutant pss <dig> showing complete loss of both pre- and post-haustorial nhr against p. sojae was selected. in successive generations, the selected pss <dig> mutant family was consistently infected by p. sojae. this mutant was phenotypically different from the pen1- <dig> because death in the mutant seedlings occurs in multiple cells as compared to in single cells in the pen1- <dig> mutant . although the p. sojae zoospores germinated and were able to form appresoria at the infection site, its growth was arrested immediately following germination on wild type col- <dig> leaves. the pen <dig> mutant showed occasional death in single cells following p. sojae infection.

to determine the extent of p. sojae growth in infected tissues, detached pss <dig> leaves were collected  <dig> hours post inoculation  with p. sojae zoospore suspensions or treatments with water droplets. leaves were then stained with aniline blue and the ultraviolet epiflourescence was visualized using a zeiss axioplan ii compound microscope
 <cit> . extensive colonization by the pathogen was observed in the pss <dig> mutant . aniline blue stains the callose deposition and papillae formation and can be used to visualize fungal structures such as runner hyphae
 <cit> . callose deposition and papillae formation have previously been used as markers for attempted penetration by fungal pathogen
 <cit> . following inoculation with p. sojae zoospores, pss <dig> leaves showed extensive callose deposition and papillae formation across the infected leaf tissue as compared to pen1- <dig> and col- <dig> . neither callose deposition nor papillae formation was detected in detached leaves that were treated with water droplets . at  <dig> hpi, extensive growth of the secondary hyphae was observed in p. sojae infected leaves of pss <dig> but not that of col- <dig> and pen1- <dig> .
 <cit> .  and , col-0;  and , pen1-1; and  and , pss <dig> leaves that were stained with aniline blue to detect callose deposition  <dig> hours post inoculation  with p. sojae by epifluorescence of the aniline blue. , 50x magnification; and , 200x magnification. arrows indicate sites of callose deposition  and secondary hyphae . the experiment was repeated twice with similar results. b, leaves of  <dig> day old col- <dig>  pen1- <dig> and pss <dig> seedlings were inoculated with p. sojae zoospores and stained with trypan blue and visualized under a zeiss axioplan ii compound microscope under bright field illumination
 <cit> .  and , col-0;  and , pen1-1; and  and , pss <dig> leaves that were stained with trypan blue to detect cell death and fungal structures  <dig> days following inoculation with p. sojae zoospores. arrows indicate reproductive structures, oogonia , sporangia  and secondary hyphae , which were visible in infected pss <dig> leaves. , 100x magnification; and , 200x magnification. the experiment was repeated twice with similar results.

to determine if p. sojae became adapted to the arabidopsis pss <dig> mutant, we conducted microscopic study of the diseased lesions of the detached pss <dig> leaves  <dig> days post-inoculation  with the zoospore suspensions of the oomycete . we observed enhanced hyphal growth and formation of reproductive structures, sporangia and oogonia on pss <dig> leaves . thus, we conclude that a gene mutated in pss <dig> is crucial for pre- and post-invasive nonhost immunity of arabidopsis against the soybean pathogen, p. sojae. we named this gene pss <dig> 

arabidopsis ecotypes showed leakiness in their nhr responses to p. sojae
columbia- <dig>  and landsberg erecta  are the two most well characterized ecotypes of arabidopsis thaliana for mapping and gene cloning experiments
 <cit> . we investigated if the ecotype ler was completely immune to p. sojae so that it could be crossed to pss <dig> for generating mapping populations. however, ler showed leakiness in its immune response against p. sojae and a significant proportion  of the ler seedlings were infected by p. sojae . this result is not very surprising because the arabidopsis ecotype l. erecta has recently been found to show susceptibility to another oomycete pathogen, pythium irregulare <cit> . we therefore inoculated  <dig> a. thaliana ecotypes with p. sojae zoospores and discovered that ecotypes, bensheim, nossen- <dig>  and niederzenz- <dig>  were completely immune to the pathogen . we selected nd- <dig> for mapping experiments because it is morphologically similar to col- <dig>  furthermore, a few molecular markers polymorphic between nd- <dig> and col- <dig> were already available
 <cit> .

 <dig> no detectable host response after inoculation with p. sojae spores.  <dig> visible necrosis at the inoculation site was observed.

pss <dig> is required for nonhost resistance of arabidopsis against p. sojae
forty-two f2: <dig> families developed from the cross between pss <dig> and nd- <dig> were evaluated for segregation of host responses to the pathogen infection. at least  <dig> progenies of each f <dig> plants were scored for disease phenotypes. the segregation of alleles at the pss <dig> locus among the f2: <dig> families fit to the 1:2: <dig> genotypic ratio for a single gene model . this observation suggested that pss <dig> is a single gene with no apparent epistatic effect from pen <dig> 

in addition to these  <dig> f2: <dig> families, we determined the phenotypes of additional families. in this experiment, only eight progenies per family were screened to identify the f2: <dig> families that carry pss <dig> in homozygous condition. to further confirm that pss <dig> is a single gene with no epistatic effect from pen <dig>  we evaluated the segregation of the pen <dig> alleles among  <dig> f2: <dig> families, homozygous for the pss <dig> allele, using the dcaps marker for pen <dig> alleles
 <cit> . pen <dig> alleles segregated in a 1:2: <dig> ratio  among the  <dig> families, homozygous for the pss <dig> allele . this result suggested an independent segregation for the two genes. among the  <dig> homozygous families for the pss <dig> allele, four were shown to carry the pen <dig> allele in homozygous condition. if the pen <dig> allele was epistatic to pss <dig> and pss <dig> were to encode only a post-invasive resistance mechanism, then the pen <dig> allele should have been in recessive homozygous condition among the pss <dig> homozygous families. thus, pss <dig> encodes a new form of penetration resistance.

expression of p. sojae effector genes in pss <dig> during infection
to determine the extent of p. sojae-gene expression, we selected two effector genes to conduct rt-pcr. it has been shown that p. sojae carries over  <dig> candidate effector proteins containing n-terminal rxlr-deer motifs
 <cit> . we studied the expression of psavh <dig> and psavh <dig> <cit>  in pss <dig>  pen <dig> and col- <dig> following inoculation with p. sojae. both effector p. sojae genes were highly expressed in the pss <dig> mutant as compared to pen <dig> and col- <dig> . this result indicates that the p. sojae colonized to a greater extent in pss <dig> as compared that in pen1- <dig> or col- <dig> 

mapping of the pss <dig> gene
in order to map the pss <dig> gene, we applied bulked segregant analysis 
 <cit> . four bulks of p. sojae susceptible plants each carrying 7– <dig> f2: <dig> susceptible families and one bulk of p. sojae resistant plants containing two homozygous  and six heterozygous  f2: <dig> families were generated. these five bulks and col- <dig> and nd- <dig> were included in bsa. we used sequence-based polymorphic 
 <cit> , sslp and caps markers in conducting bsa.

the pss <dig> region was putatively mapped to the south arm of chromosome  <dig> . to develop a high-density map of the pss <dig> region, five sbp markers from this region were generated. sbp_ <dig>  marker showed a recombination event with the pss <dig> locus in the f2: <dig> family  <dig> suggesting that pss <dig> is located south of this marker . no recombination was observed between pss <dig> and sbp_ <dig>  marker, located at the telomeric end of chromosome  <dig> . the physical distance between sbp_ <dig>  and sbp_ <dig>  is ~ <dig>  mb.

the arabidopsis pss <dig> mutant is infected by the fungal pathogen, fusarium virguliforme, which causes sudden death syndrome in soybean
we investigated if pss <dig> controls arabidopsis nhr against the fungal pathogen, f. virguliforme that causes sudden death syndrome  in soybean. from the segregating materials used for mapping the pss <dig> gene, we selected six f2: <dig> families that were homozygous for either pss <dig> or pss <dig> alleles  and used these families in determining the role of pss <dig> in nhr of arabidopsis against f. virguliforme. seedlings of the selected families were grown in 24-well microtiter plates for  <dig> days and then inoculated with f. virguliforme conidial spores. infected seedlings were stained with trypan blue and observed under a light microscope . significant proportions of seedlings in six families carrying the pss <dig> allele were infected by the fungal pathogen . this result suggests that pss <dig> is also essential for nhr against the soybean pathogen, f. virguliforme.

pss <dig> is not required for nhr of arabidopsis against the non-adaptive pathogen pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea that causes bacterial blight in soybean
we investigated if pss <dig> is required for nhr of arabidopsis against the bacterial pathogen, pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea  that causes bacterial blight in soybean
 <cit> . we inoculated the six f2: <dig> families homozygous for pss <dig> and five f2: <dig> families homozygous for the pss <dig> allele with psg . we observed no association of pss <dig> and pss <dig> alleles with the colony forming units  of the bacterial pathogen. we classified the responses of the selected families into two broad groups, one with cfu comparable to those observed for col- <dig> and nd-0; and the other one with five- or more-fold lesser cfu as compared to those observed in col- <dig> and nd- <dig>  surprisingly, pen1- <dig> consistently showed about 4-5-fold less bacterial growth as compared to that in col- <dig> . to determine if pen <dig> is required for growth of psg, we genotyped the selected susceptible and resistant f2: <dig> families for the pen <dig> locus . no association was observed between alleles at the pen <dig> locus and the levels of psg cfu. these results suggested that an unknown mutation in the pen1- <dig> genotype is most likely involved in enhancing resistance of arabidopsis against psg  and the unknown gene could be a negative regulator of disease resistance.

discussion
transfer of nhr mechanisms across species may lead to development of broad-spectrum and durable resistance in economically important crop species. identification of nho <dig> and pen genes established the molecular basis of nhr. it also suggested the feasibility of transferring single gene-encoded nhr across plant species for creating durable and broad-spectrum resistance
 <cit> .

here we have described the arabidopsis pss <dig> locus that carries one of the nonhost resistance genes conferring immunity of arabidopsis against two important soybean pathogens, p. sojae and f. virguliforme. considering the disease phenotypes observed in detached leaves of pss <dig> as opposed to that in detached leaves of the pen1- <dig> mutant following p. sojae inoculation , the nhr mechanism governed by pss <dig> is most likely important not only to provide penetration resistance, but also to confer necessary protection against further spread of the pathogen. pss <dig> supports secondary hyphal growth and sporulation of p. sojae . these observations suggest that pss <dig> encodes a nhr defense mechanism that regulates both penetration and post-penetration resistance. it has been shown that the nhr mechanism at the post-haustorial stage is most important in sow thistle for providing resistance against a poorly adapted powdery mildew fungus, golovinomyces cichoracearum umsg1
 <cit> . similar mechanism could also be important for nhr of arabidopsis against the non-adapted oomycete pathogen, p. sojae.

segregation data from a cross between pss <dig> and nd- <dig> revealed 1:2: <dig> genotypic segregation ratio for the alleles at the pss <dig> locus ; and therefore, it is a single gene. alleles at the pen <dig> locus segregated independently of the alleles at the pss <dig> locus . the p. sojae susceptible phenotype of the pss <dig> allele is manifested even in the presence of pen <dig>  thus, pss <dig> controls a novel defense mechanism for penetration resistance against the oomycete pathogen, p. sojae and the fungal pathogen, f. virguliforme. pen genes have been shown to regulate two distinct nhr mechanisms that are involved in penetration resistance. monogenic inheritance of pss <dig> with no epistatic effect from pen <dig> suggests that an additional arabidopsis nhr mechanism is operative against penetration by oomycete and fusarium pathogens. pss <dig> is located in an approximately  <dig>  mb region flanked by two sequence-based polymorphic markers, sbp_ <dig>  and the telomere-specific sbp_ <dig>  . this region does not contain any characterized plant defense or disease resistance genes. thus, most likely we have identified a novel nonhost resistance mechanism in arabidopsis.

the important hallmarks of a successful adapted pathogen are its ability to establish feeding structures, derive nutrition from the host and finally to complete its lifecycle in the host plant
 <cit> . aniline blue staining has previously been used to show oomycete feeding structures such as runner hyphae
 <cit> . we observed secondary hyphae even after  <dig> hpi suggesting that p. sojae is able to form feeding structures in pss <dig> leaves at a very early stage following inoculation . sporangia are specialized asexual reproductive structures of oomycetes which can either germinate into hyphae or release about 10– <dig> zoospores to complete the asexual life-cycle. the male and female reproductive structures, antheridia and oogonia, are fused to develop oospores and complete the sexual life
 <cit> . p. sojae developed both sporangia and oogonia in infected pss <dig> leaves; and thus, completed its life cycle in this mutant . in contrast, in pen1- <dig> leaves the pathogen was able to penetrate single cells, which die following penetration; while in the wild type col- <dig> leaves, germinated p. sojae zoospores failed to penetrate host cells .

lack of epistasis of pen <dig> on pss <dig> , growth of secondary hyphae and rapid induction of effector genes in the pss <dig> mutant, and most importantly completion of the p. sojae’s life cycle in infected pss <dig> mutant leaves suggest that pss <dig> encodes a novel nhr mechanism that regulates both pre- and post-invasive resistance of arabidopsis against the nonhost pathogen. transfer of this to soybean could play an important role in creating broad-spectrum disease resistant not only against p. sojae, but also f. virguliforme. it is also possible that pss <dig> encoded resistance may be applicable to fighting diseases caused by oomycete pathogens in other crop species; such as potatoes and tomatoes.

it has been shown that lack of either of a functional pathway, the pen1/snap33/vamp721/ <dig> or the indole- glucosinolates/metabolites pathway, involving the pen2/pen <dig> activity is sufficient to allow a non-adapted fungal pathogen to enter arabidopsis mutant plants at a rate similar to that in an adapted host
 <cit> . however, a complete loss of the subsequent post-invasion resistance mechanism encoded by plant defense genes pad <dig> and sag <dig> is necessary for a nonhost plant species to become a host for such non-adapted fungal pathogens
 <cit> . in light of the critical role of the post-invasion genes as determinants of the nonhost status of arabidopsis against non-adapted fungal pathogens, pss1’s role at both pre- and post-haustorial levels in conferring nhr of arabidopsis against p. sojae is novel.

in vivo trans-specific gene silencing in fusarium verticillioides from transgenic tobacco provides molecular evidence suggesting a possible short biotrophic phase in fusarium species <cit> . f. virguliforme has been considered to be semi-biotrophic fungus with its ability to feed on live host soybean cells
 <cit> . thus, most likely pss <dig> may regulate the immunity against both hemibiotrophs, p. sojae and f. virguliforme, by using the same mechanism. the differing lifestyles of the two pathogens, p. sojae and f. virguliforme and the importance of pss <dig> in providing nonhost resistance against both of these pathogens hints at a crucial role of this gene in broader nonhost resistance of the model plant, arabidopsis.

CONCLUSIONS
analyses of the segregants homozygous for alleles at both pen <dig> and pss <dig> loci revealed that pen <dig> does not have any epistatic effect on the pss <dig> function. the present study thus revealed a novel nonhost gene, pss <dig>  which confers immunity of arabidopsis against two non-adaptive soybean pathogens, p. sojae and f. virguliforme. responses of pss <dig> and pen1- <dig> to p. sojae invasion were distinct and pss <dig> acts at both pre- and post-haustorial levels, while pen <dig> acts at the pre-haustorial level. identification and further characterization of the gene would provide us further insights about this new form of nonhost resistance against two non-adaptive soybean pathogens. this study thus laid the foundation for possible development of soybean germplasm with durable resistance against two serious pathogens.
