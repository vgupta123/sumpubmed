BACKGROUND
proanthocyanidins  are a subgroup of a large class of plant secondary metabolites known as flavonoids. due to their important roles in plant defense and their beneficial role in human health, our understanding of pas as well as the general flavonoid biosynthetic pathway has greatly improved in the past decades . a general pa synthesis pathway is summarized in fig.  <dig>  the mechanisms regulating the transcription of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway genes are well studied in the model systems arabidopsis  and maize   <cit> . transcriptional regulation of the genes encoding the key enzymes of the flavonoid pathway is mediated by members of three protein families: the r2r3-myb transcription factors, the myc-like basic helix-loop-helix  proteins and the wd <dig> repeat proteins .fig.  <dig> working model of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin synthesis pathway adapted from  <cit> . enzymes are represented in uppercase bold letters; the products in the pathway are given in black boxes. the enzymes involved in the pathway are shown as follows: chs, chalcone synthase; chi, chalcone isomerase; f3h, flavanone-3β-hydroxylase; dfr, dihydroflavonol-4-reductase; ldox, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; fls, flavonol synthase; lar, leucoanthocyanidin reductase; anr, anthocyanidin reductase; and ufgt, udp-glc:flavonoid-3-o-glucosyltransferase



the regulation of proanthocyanidin  synthesis has been well characterized by the analysis of transparent testa  mutants that fail to accumulate pas in the seed coat  <cit> . three tt loci, tt <dig>  tt <dig> and ttg <dig>  which encode r2r3-myb, bhlh and wd <dig> repeat proteins respectively, are necessary for proper temporal and spatial accumulation of pas  <cit> . the combinatorial interactions of different members from these three protein families determine the specificity of target gene activation  <cit> . this interaction has been shown for several flavonoids synthesis regulators isolated from arabidopsis  <cit> , zea mays  <cit>  and petunia hybrida . the three proteins interact and form a ternary transcriptional protein complex to activate “late” pa-specific genes including dfr , ldox  and ban   <cit> . another three tt loci, tt <dig>  tt <dig> and ttg <dig> that encode a mads box protein, a zinc-finger protein and a wrky transcription factor, respectively, are also important for pa synthesis  <cit> . these proteins have been shown to regulate the expression of ban protein through a posttranscriptional mechanism and thus are involved in the differentiation of pa-accumulating cells  <cit> .

the tt <dig> gene product  is a key regulator of pa synthesis and confers target gene specificity to the myb-bhlh-wd <dig> complex. it is specifically expressed in pa-accumulating cells in arabidopsis but can induce ectopic expression of the ban gene when constitutively expressed in the presence of a functional tt <dig> protein  <cit> . tt <dig> belongs to the large r2r3-myb protein family that has  <dig> members in arabidopsis. these proteins are typically involved in many aspects of plant secondary metabolism, plant cell identity and cell fate determination  <cit> . members of the r2r3-myb protein family are characterized by the presence of two highly conserved head-to-tail myb motifs in the n-terminal region, the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats, although their c-terminal regions are very divergent. each of the r2r <dig> repeats consists of three α-helices  <cit> ; helix  <dig> of each motif is involved in interaction with dna and helix  <dig> of the r <dig> repeat is important for corresponding bhlh recognition.

in addition to arabidopsis, the tt2-like pa-specific r2r3-myb transcription factors  have been characterized in grape , lotus , poplar , persimmon , clover  and medicago  . in grape, two tt2-like myb tfs  have been identified {bogs,  <dig> #594}{terrier,  <dig> #9}. these tfs exhibit tissue-specific functions in inducing pa structural gene expression and synthesis: vvmybpa <dig> is mainly expressed in seeds; and vvmybpa <dig> is mainly in expressed in exocarp of young berries and in the leaves. similar observations were reported in lotus, in which three copies of tt2-like r2r3-myb tfs were identified that differed in organ-specific expression and responsiveness to stress {yoshida,  <dig> #775}. each of the tfs mentioned above is capable of activating the anr promoter in transient reporter assays. in poplar, a myb <dig> gene encoding a tt2-like tf was recently shown to be responsive to wounding, pathogen presence and uv-b irradiation, consistent with the biological roles of pas in anti-herbivore, anti-pathogen and uv damage protection {mellway,  <dig> #823}. overexpression of myb <dig> in poplar resulted in transcriptional activation of the genes encoding enzymes of the full pa biosynthesis pathway from pal <dig> to anr and lar, but not fls, which is specific to flavonol synthesis.

there are a variety of plant-based foods and beverages that serve as natural sources of flavonoids, including cacao, red wine, grape, apple and cranberries. among those, cacao has an extraordinarily high amount of flavonoid, especially pas  <cit> , which make up about 10–14 % of dry weight in mature beans  <cit> . the development of cacao and flavonoid  synthesis has been described previously  <cit> . the development of cacao fruits can be divided into three phases  <cit> . following pollination and fertilization, the first phase of fruit development is initiated and fruit begins to expand slowly at a rate of about 30–40 cm3/ week  <cit> . this phase lasts 6– <dig> weeks until the first division of the fertilized egg, which initiates the second phase of pod development. at the second phase, fruits expand more rapidly at a rate of about 110–130 cm3/week, and embryos enlarge but remain unpigmented till they reach the length of ovules at about 14– <dig> weeks after pollination  <cit> . when the fruits are 14– <dig> weeks old, the pericarp begins to change color from green to orange , denoting onset of the third phase, ripening. ripe pod color varies from bright red, purple, green, yellow and multi-colored patterns, dependent on genotype. during the third phase, the increase in the fruit external dimensions gradually slows and finally ceases. the seeds begin to solidify and their dry weight increases rapidly at a rate of about 20–40 mg/day. seed length remains constant as they continue to accumulate anthocyanins and gradually darken until maturity at about 20 weeks after pollination .

this research describes the isolation and characterization of a cacao gene, tc-mybpa, which encodes an r2r3-myb transcription factor involved in regulating the biosynthesis of cacao pas. constitutive expression of tc-mybpa in the arabidopsis tt <dig> mutant not only successfully complemented its primary phenotype  but also resulted in increased anthocyanin accumulation in young seedlings, suggesting that tc-mybpa may regulate both the anthocyanin and pa pathways in cacao.

RESULTS
the cacao tc-mybpa gene encodes an r2r3-myb transcription factor
four putative tc-mybpa cdna sequences were identified in a collection of theobroma cacao expressed sequence tags   <cit>  by querying the cacao esttik database  with the protein sequence of arabidopsis tt <dig> . this cacao est database contains  <dig> cdna libraries constructed from different organs; two main genotypes and different stress conditions thus could be considered as an exhaustive collection of cacao expressed genes  <cit> . ests showing sequence similarity to the tt <dig> gene were assembled into a contig to recover full-length open reading frames  by alignment with cdnas of homologous genes from other species and predictions from the orf finder program . the full-length coding sequence of tc-mybpa was amplified by rt-pcr using cdnas isolated from young leaves of cacao , in which pas are actively synthesized and accumulated  <cit> . the isolated orf was named tc-mybpa . by searching the newly assembled cacao genome  <cit> , we identified the tc-mybpa gene  that is 1477-bp long with two exons. it is not associated with any currently identified quantitative trait loci  related to flavonoids. however, the tc-mybpa is very closely associated with  <dig> out of  <dig> dfr orthologous genes located near the bottom of chromosome  <dig>  we also searched the whole cacao genome with the protein sequence of arabidopsis tt <dig> to check if there are other possible homologues genes. the search revealed  <dig> candidate genes with higher score than tc-mybpa . however, we didn’t find any confident hits by searching their putative protein sequences back to the cacao est database. considering that this est database contains a variety of tissues that have been shown to synthesize and accumulate pas  <cit> , including leaves, roots, flowers, pods, seeds, and seed testa, the  <dig> candidate genes maybe be peudogenes and not express at all.

the 864-bp orf of tc-mybpa encodes a protein of  <dig> amino acids that shares 68 % identity with grape vvmybpa <dig>  a protein sequence alignment of tc-mybpa with other pa- and anthocyanin-regulating myb proteins revealed that tc-mybpa contains an n-terminal r2r <dig> repeat that corresponds to the dna-binding domain of plant myb-type proteins . like the high sequence similarity observed between the r2r <dig> repeat regions shared by  <dig> members of arabidopsis  <cit> , the tc-mybpa r2r <dig> repeat region is highly conserved when compared to other plant r2r <dig> mybs. the tc-mybpa n-terminal region also contains the lx2x3lx6lx3r motif for interaction with bhlh partners in the r <dig> repeat region  <cit> , whereas the c-terminal region shows little homology to the myb proteins included in this comparison.

to investigate these relationships more closely, a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the full-length amino acid sequences of tc-mybpa and sequences of all functionally tested mybs involved in regulating proanthocyanidin and anthocyanin biosynthesis, as well as mybs associated with several other biological processes . by searching the cacao est database using tblastn with the protein sequence of putative cacao myb tc-mybpa as the query, three est contigs  containing myb-like proteins were also identified as the next best cacao matches to tc-mybpa. the results show that the putative cacao proanthocyanidin regulatory protein tc-mybpa is most closely related to the grape pa regulatory myb protein vvmybpa <dig> and clusters in the same clade with all the anthocyanidin and proanthocyanidin regulatory myb proteins.

this clade also includes vvmyb5a and vvmyb5b from grape, which are involved in regulating the entire flavonoid pathway, and phph <dig> from petunia, which is involved in regulating vacuolar ph. r2r3-type myb proteins that regulate other biochemical and physiological processes such as phlobaphene and flavonol synthesis, cell shape determination and trichome development clustered into separate subgroups. the other three cacao myb-like proteins cluster together with mybs that have functions other than proanthocyanidin regulation, such as flavonoid pathway regulation , cell shape determination  and anthocyanidin synthesis regulation . zmc <dig>  the maize anthocyanin synthesis regulator that was shown to activate the arabidopsis anr promoter  <cit> , clustered together in the same subgroup with attt <dig> and vvmyppa <dig>  which are functionally verified pa regulators. this was consistent with the protein alignment analysis in which zmc <dig> was more similar to pa regulatory mybs than to anthocyanin regulatory mybs. protein alignment also revealed that some conserved amino acids present in the n-terminal region of tc-mybpa as well as all pa regulatory myb proteins and zmc <dig> were absent in all the other anthocyanin myb factors ; this could indicate similarity in function. these included, according to position on tc-mybpa, his <dig>  gly <dig>  ile <dig>  asp <dig>  glu <dig>  and ile <dig> fig.  <dig> comparison of the amino acid sequences of tc-mybpa and various plant myb transcription factors. a alignment of the deduced amino acid sequences of the r2r3-myb proteins functioning in anthocyanin and pa synthesis, including tc-mybpa , zmc <dig> , vvmybpa <dig>  vvmybpa <dig>  vvmyba <dig>  vvmyba <dig> , ptmyb <dig> , ljtt2a, ljtt2b, ljtt2c , and arabidopsis regulators attt <dig>  atpap <dig> and atpap <dig>  the r <dig> and r <dig> repeats of the myb domain are indicated above the alignment. identical amino acids are indicated in black, similar amino acids in gray. arrowheads indicate amino acids that are conserved in all pa-regulating mybs but absent in anthocyanin-regulating mybs. sequences were aligned using the clustalw program and were displayed using the genedoc program. b phylogenetic tree showing selected plant myb transcription factors from genbank. human c-myb is included as an outgroup. functions of the myb proteins are given on the right side in bold. the alignment was performed using the clustalw program and the tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining algorithm of the mega package . the scale bar represents  <dig>  substitutions per site and the numbers next to each node are bootstrap values from  <dig> replicates. the genbank accession numbers of the myb proteins are as follows: atgl <dig> , zmp , zmc <dig> , vvmyba <dig> , vvmyba <dig> , atpap <dig> , phan <dig> , leant <dig> , osmyb <dig> , ammixta , atmyb <dig> , atmyb <dig> , pmmybf <dig> , phph <dig> , atpap <dig> , atmybwer , vvmyb5a , vvmyb5b , vvmybpa <dig> , vvmybpa <dig> , c-myb , ptmyb <dig> , phmyb <dig> , ljtt2a , ljtt2b , ljtt2c , attt <dig> , mtmybpar , tamyb <dig>  also included in the tree are one putative cacao pa specific myb , and three myb-like proteins found in the cacao est collections 



in summary, the tc-mybpa protein sequence includes conserved r2r <dig> regions typical of plant myb transcription factors. moreover, in tc-mybpa, we were able to detect conserved amino acid homologies shared with all the tt2-like myb regulators but absent in anthocyanin regulators. these conserved amino acids appear to be specific to this clade and may be used to identify candidate pa-specific myb regulators from other plant species.

expression of tc-mybpa correlates with pa accumulation in theobroma cacao
we have previous identified and functionally verified key pa biosynthesis structural genes tcanr, tcans and tclar  <cit> . a scan of the promoter sequences in the palace database  <cit>  of these pa synthesis genes revealed several target motifs of myb transcription factors on each of them . interestingly, mybcore, the key cis-regulatory element for binding pa synthesis regulating myb transcription factors  <cit> , was found in all of them, suggesting that they could all be downstream targets of the putative tc-mybpa. to assess the involvement of tc-mybpa in pa biosynthesis, the expression of the putative tc-mybpa gene was examined in tissue samples from different developmental stages of leaves, flowers and pods in which pas accumulate. in addition, the expression of the cacao pa biosynthesis structural genes tcanr, tcans and tclar were also examined.

a strong positive correlation of expression levels of the putative tc-mybpa and the structural genes was observed in all tissues. the steady state levels of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar transcripts were highest in young leaves and decreased in older leaves . relatively high levels were present in flower tissues. we also measured the accumulation of total soluble pas  and insoluble pas in the different tissues by dmaca assay and butanol-hcl assay respectively . both cacao leaves and flowers contained significant levels of pas. the highest total soluble pas were detected in the youngest leaves , fig. 3b). much lower amounts were detected in older leaves. total insoluble pas were relatively lower in young leaves and continued to increase as the leaves aged and became harder. insoluble pas reached their maximum level in lignified stage e leaves . pa levels were also considerable in flowers, with higher soluble pas levels observed in unopened flowers than in opened flowers, and the levels of the insoluble fraction relatively the same in the two stages of flower development .fig.  <dig> expression of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar genes and accumulation of pas in theobroma cacao  leaves and flowers at various developmental stages. a transcript levels of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar. expression was determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and was calculated relative to the expression of tcactin in each sample. b levels of soluble pas expressed as mg pa per g of fresh weight. c levels of insoluble pas expressed as mg pa per g of fresh weight. all data are presented as means ± se, for gene expression data, n ≥  <dig>  for pa level data, n ≥  <dig>  fw, fresh weight



figure  <dig> shows both the expression patterns of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar  and pa levels in whole cacao pods early in their development when the pods are too small to separate ovules and exocarp . the expression of both tc-mybpa and the three pa structural genes shared a similar pattern. their expression was relatively high at two weeks after pollination  and remained high at  <dig> wap, followed by a significant decrease at  <dig> wap . levels of soluble pas were already close to maximum  at the earliest sampling time point , whereas insoluble pas reached maximum levels at  <dig> wap .fig.  <dig> expression of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar genes and accumulation of pas in whole pods of theobroma cacao  during early stages of pod development . a transcript levels of tcanr, tcans and tclar. expression was determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and was calculated relative to the expression of tcactin in each sample. b levels of total soluble pas expressed as mg pas per g of fresh weight. c levels of total insoluble pas expressed as μg pas per g of fresh weight. all data are presented as means ± se. for gene expression data, n ≥  <dig>  for pa accumulation data, n ≥  <dig>  fw, fresh weight



at  <dig> wap, the pods were large enough to allow dissection into exocarp and ovule samples for separate analysis. expression patterns of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar genes and pa levels in cacao pod exocarp tissues were examined at two-week intervals, from  <dig> wap to  <dig> wap, when pods fully ripened. the expression of all four genes examined was similar . they were all relatively high from  <dig> wap to  <dig> wap but decreased significantly at  <dig> wap, increasing again at  <dig> wap and reaching a maximum at  <dig> wap. in accordance with gene expression patterns, the deposition of both soluble and insoluble pas continued to increase during the development of the pods, reaching a maximum  around the time of ripening , while a pause of the pa accumulation occurred at  <dig> wap, at which time point, soluble pas were about the same level as  <dig> wap and insoluble pas slightly decreased.fig.  <dig> expression of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar genes and accumulation of pas in pod exocarp of theobroma cacao  during pod development . a transcript levels of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar. expression was determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and was calculated relative to the expression of tcactin in each sample. b levels of total soluble pas expressed as mg pas per g of fresh weight. c levels of total insoluble pas expressed as μg pas per g of fresh weight. all data are presented as means ± se, for gene expression data, n ≥  <dig>  for pa level data, n ≥  <dig>  fw, fresh weight



unlike the co-regulated pattern of gene expression in exocarp, the expression pattern of tc-mybpa and tcans differed quite significantly from that of tcanr and tclar in ovules . the expression of tcanr and tclar in ovules was quite similar, maintaining relatively high levels before  <dig> wap but significantly decreasing at  <dig> wap, then increasing at  <dig> wap and dropping again at  <dig> wap. the overall expression level of tclar was lower than that of tcanr. in contrast, neither tc-mybpa nor tcans expression decreased at  <dig> wap but remained relatively stable  throughout pod development, from  <dig> wap to  <dig> wap, although a slight increase did occur after  <dig> wap followed by slight decrease at  <dig> wap. the pa concentrations of both soluble and insoluble fractions in cacao ovules were lower than in exocarp . the ovule soluble pa accumulation was relatively low before  <dig> wap and significantly increased at  <dig> wap, reaching a maximum at  <dig> wap . however, throughout the development of ovules, insoluble pa levels increased at a relatively constant rate from  <dig> wap.fig.  <dig> expression of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar genes and accumulation of pas in ovules of theobroma cacao  during pod development . a transcript levels of tc-mybpa, tcanr, tcans and tclar. expression was determined by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and was calculated relative to the expression of tcactin in each sample. b levels of total soluble pas expressed as mg pas per g of fresh weight. c levels of total insoluble pas expressed as ug pas per g of fresh weight. all data are presented as means ± se, for gene expression data, n ≥  <dig>  for pa level data, n ≥  <dig>  fw, fresh weight



the coordinated expression of tc-mybpa and tcans suggest that tc-mybpa may contribute to the regulation of anthocyanin synthesis as well as pa synthesis. nevertheless, the regulation of the pa-specific genes tcanr and tclar may also involve other transcription factors such as bhlh and wd <dig> repeat proteins whose interactions with tc-mybpa determine their specific expression patterns, which are slightly different from tcans. to gain a better understanding of their regulation, further characterization and expression analysis of bhlh and wd <dig> genes will be helpful.

tc-mybpa complements the pa-deficient phenotype of the arabidopsis tt <dig> mutant
based on the very high degree of sequence conservation with arabidopsis tt <dig>  we hypothesized that the candidate gene tc-mybpa encodes a protein transcription factor that participates in the regulation of the pa biosynthesis genes lar, anr and ldox. to test this hypothesis, a genetic complementation test was performed by introduction of a constitutively expressed tc-mycpa coding sequence into the arabidopsis tt <dig> mutant  <cit> , creating tc-mybpa-tt <dig> transgenic plants. twenty one hygromycin-resistant transgenic t <dig> plants were generated and all of them developed a normal phenotype regarding general plant health, vigor, size and height. three independent hygromycin-resistant transgenic t <dig> plants of tc-mybpa-tt <dig> were selected because of their increased seed coat color by visual observation. after staining with dimethylaminocinnamaldehyde , a dye that can specifically interact with pas and present a blue reaction product  <cit> ,  <dig> lines  stained blue with dmaca , suggesting deposition of pas in the seed coat. the other lines that did not develop an increased seed coat color also did not stain blue with dmaca . in line  <dig>  the dmaca staining resulted in nearly the same intense color as in col-0; while in line  <dig>  the blue color was less intense than in col- <dig>  suggesting decreased pa levels compared to wild-type. rt-pcr using rna extracted from t <dig> seedlings confirmed expression of the tc-mybpa gene in these transgenic lines and indicated that line  <dig> had the highest expression level, which correlated with the highest pa levels as suggested by dmaca staining . pa levels in the two tc-mybpa-tt <dig> lines were 2-8-fold higher than in the tt <dig> background . tc-mybpa-tt <dig> line  <dig>  which had the highest tc-mybpa expression, had nearly the same pa concentration as in the col- <dig> seeds. in the young seedlings, two transgenic lines  accumulated elevated levels of anthocyanins in the hypocotyls compared to tt <dig> mutant plants. line  <dig>  which has the highest tc-mybpa gene expression level, accumulated the most red/purple anthocyanin pigments.fig.  <dig> complementation of the pa-deficient tt <dig> mutant phenotype by constitutively expressing tc-mybpa. a 7-day old seedlings of and dmaca stained seeds from col- <dig>  the tt <dig> mutant  and three independent t <dig> transgenic lines of tt- 35s:tc-mybpa. the bar represents 1 mm. b rt-pcr analysis of tc-mybpa and atubiquitin transcripts in total rna from the young seedlings shown in . pcr products from the tc-mybpa-pgem plasmid were loaded on the last lane as a positive control for the tc-mybpa primer set and as a negative control for the atubiquitin primer set. c, pa levels in mature seeds of plants shown in . pa levels were determined by extraction and dmaca reaction using procyanidin b <dig> as a standard. all the data are presented as means ± se, n =  <dig>  **p <  <dig>  versus tt2; ***p <  <dig>  versus tt <dig>  fw, fresh weight



in order to confirm that tc-mybpa activates pa synthesis genes, we used semi-quantitative rt-pcr to examine the expression of relevant genes in young seedlings of transgenic tc-mybpa-tt <dig> lines, untransformed tt <dig> mutant and wild-type plants . expression levels were measured for the pa-related structural genes  as well as the general flavonoid pathway genes , a flavonol-specific gene  and an anthocyanin-specific gene . gene expression of dfr and ldox was at about the same level as in the wild-type  control and the tt <dig> mutant, a result consistent with their contribution to anthocyanidin synthesis. in all transgenic lines, overexpression of tc-mybpa was found to activate the flavonoid late biosynthesis genes  <cit>  related to pa synthesis . there was a 2-fold increase of dfr gene expression in all transgenic lines, and an approximate  <dig> - <dig> -fold increase of ldox gene expression. ban was not expressed in either tt <dig> or col- <dig> seedlings but it was significantly activated in the transgenic lines, suggesting that tc-mybpa controls its activation. however, no significant gene activation was detected for all the other flavonoid genes including chs, chi, f3h representing the general flavonoid pathway, fls representing the flavonol-specific pathway and ufgt representing the anthocyanin-specific pathway.fig.  <dig> semi-quantitative rt-pcr analysis of expression of flavonoid structural genes in young seedlings of the same arabidopsis lines analyzed in fig.  <dig>  dfr, dihydroflavonol reductase; ldox, leucoanthocyanidin dioxygenase; ban, banyuls ; ufgt, udp-glc flavonoid glucosyltransferase; chs, chalcone synthase; chi, chalcone isomerase; f3h, flavonoid 3’-hydroxylase; fls, flavonol synthase, ubi, ubiquitin



discussion
in this study, amino acid sequence motifs specific to the pa-regulating clade of myb transcription factors from other species were used to identify a candidate cacao ortholog. we compared five genes from four species including arabidopsis and lotus tt <dig>  <cit> , grape vvmybpa <dig> and vvmybpa <dig>  <cit>  and poplar myb <dig>  <cit> . each of these has been experimentally demonstrated to play a key role in regulating the transcription of pa biosynthesis genes. arabidopsis and lotus tt <dig>  poplar myb <dig> and grape vvmybpa <dig> formed a phylogenetic cluster with zmc <dig> from maize, which has been shown to activate the arabidopsis anr promoter  <cit> . however, cacao tc-mybpa and grape vvmybpa <dig> are not in the clade that contains most of the pa-regulating mybs; they formed another cluster that is significantly closer to the tt2/c <dig> clade than to other functionally unrelated myb regulators. by contrast, the multiple protein sequence alignment including all the known pa and anthocyanin-regulatory myb proteins revealed some pa specific motifs in the n-terminal domain. five sites  were conserved in all pa-specific mybs, including zmc <dig>  but were absent from all other anthocyanin-specific mybs. the discrepancy between the phylogenetic analysis, which showed a separate clade of tc-mybpa and vvmybpa <dig> distinct from all other pa-regulatory mybs, and the protein alignment, which clearly showed highly conserved pa-specific protein motifs in all pa mybs, may result from the low homology c-terminal domain of those r2r <dig> myb proteins. similar to the results of bogs et al.  <cit> , none of the conserved motifs in the c-terminal domain described by stracke et al.  <cit>  were found. by contrast, phylogenic analysis seems to be a strong predictor of the anthocyanin regulatory myb proteins, with all the functionally proven anthocyanin specific myb transcription factors falling into the same subgroup . interestingly, grape and cacao also share the distinction, together with tea, of being commercial species containing the highest levels of pa in all commonly consumed foods  <cit> .

the analysis of pa levels during leaf development revealed that pa synthesis in cacao leaves occurs at higher levels in young leaves then in older leaves. this correlates with the synthesis of anthocyanins, which are present at a much higher concentrations in younger stage leaves than in mature leaves  <cit> . anthocyanin and pa synthesis share common structural enzymes in the pa synthesis pathway, including anthocyanin synthase , which produces cyanidins used in the anr reaction leading to epicatechins and in the ufgt reaction leading to anthocyanidins. consistent with the pa and anthocyanin accumulation patterns, the cacao pa-specific structural genes anr and lar and the anthocyanin pa-common gene ans were all co-regulated in developing leaves and more highly expressed in younger leaves compared to older leaves. expression of the tc-mybpa gene correlated well with pa accumulation rates and expression of the pa biosynthetic genes tcanr, tcans and tcanr. similar results were observed from tc-mybpa transcript profiling in young pods and exocarp tissues, in which tc-mybpa exhibits the exactly same pattern with the co-regulated pa synthesis genes tcanr, tcans and tcanr, suggesting that the tc-mybpa protein is involved in regulation of pa biosynthesis in leaves, young pods and exocarp.

in cacao reproductive tissues, pa synthesis began in developing flowers prior to pollination and continued in fruits until maturation, while anthocyanin synthesis began at the onset of fruit ripening and paralleled pa synthesis until maturation. distinct from co-regulated expression of tcans, tcanr and tclar genes in fruit exocarp, the tcans gene had a different expression pattern from that of tcanr and tclar in ovules. tcanr and tclar were still co-regulated in ovules throughout developmental stages and both dropped at  <dig> wap when fruit ripening commences and anthocyanin synthesis begins, while tcans expression remained relatively high at  <dig> wap, likely contributing to anthocyanin synthesis. surprisingly, tc-mybpa shared the same expression pattern with tcans rather than with the pa-specific genes tcanr and tclar, and the expression level remained stable, showing no decrease at  <dig> wap. similar observations were observed regarding the expression pattern of vvmybpa <dig> in grape skins, in which vvmybpa <dig> retained a relatively high transcript level two weeks after the onset of ripening and pa synthesis completely stopped when anthocyanin synthesis began  <cit> . one interpretation is that the high levels of vvmybpa <dig> could also contribute to anthocyanin synthesis, as it could activate the promoter of the vvans  gene. overall, the expression pattern of tc-mybpa suggests that the encoded protein is involved in regulation of pa biosynthesis; moreover, it may also be involved in regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis.

overexpression of tc-mybpa in the arabidopsis tt <dig> mutant complemented the pa-deficient phenotype in arabidopsis mature seeds . this indicated that this r2r3-type myb transcription factor was able to substitute for the function of the key arabidopsis pa regulator tt <dig>  in contrast to grape vvmybpa <dig> , which can induce ectopic pa accumulation when overexpressed in arabidopsis, tc-mybpa-tt <dig> transgenic plants accumulated pas only in the seed coat. this tissue specific phenotype was similar to arabidopsis tt <dig>  which also failed to induce pa accumulation in tissues other than seed coat when ectopically expressed. gene expression analysis of tc-mybpa-tt <dig> transgenic plants showed that overexpression of tc-mybpa induced only late flavonoid biosynthetic genes, dfr, ldox and ban, similar to arabidopsis tt <dig>  which also controls only the late flavonoid biosynthetic genes dfr and ban  <cit> . by contrast, vvmybpa <dig> regulates the entire flavonoid pathway branch leading to pa synthesis, including both early and late flavonoid biosynthetic genes  <cit> .

in transgenic arabidopsis expressing the tc-mybpa gene, an increased accumulation of anthocyanins was also observed in hypocotyls of young seedlings; especially in line  <dig>  which showed an obvious visual color difference compared to untransformed controls. this could be explained by the ability of tc-mybpa to induce the expression of ldox , which is a structural gene contributing to both the anthocyanin and the proanthocyanin pathway. this is different from the arabidopsis tt <dig> myb transcription factor, which has been shown to involved specifically in the genetic control of flavonoid late biosynthesis genes  including dfr, ldox and ban only in seeds  <cit> . however, both ban and tt <dig> are not expressed in seedlings, while both dfr and ldox are expressed in seedlings, contributing to anthocyanin synthesis. their expression is controlled by another myb transcription factor, atpap <dig> , whereas over-expression of attt <dig> did not increase the expression levels of lbgs in seedlings, with the exception of ban, suggesting its specific involvement in pa synthesis  <cit> . the activity of tc-mybpa was in contrast to grape vvmybpa <dig>  although vvmybpa <dig> could activate the vvldox gene promoter in transient reporter gene assays, it failed to induce anthocyanin synthesis when overexpressed in arabidopsis  <cit> . bogs et al. also showed that anthocyanin synthesis in grape was regulated by another myb transcription factor vvmyba <dig>  <cit> . however, the data from this research in transgenic arabidopsis demonstrated that activation of anthocyanin synthesis was consistent with the tc-mybpa gene expression pattern in cacao, which was co-regulated with the tcans gene and coincided with anthocyanin synthesis. taken together, in cacao, tc-mybpa appeared to be capable of regulating both the pa and anthocyanin pathway by activating late pa biosynthetic genes. potentially, this could provide a means to manipulate the amount and composition of pas and anthocyanin together in cacao and possibly in other fruits. the different activities of the related myb transcription factor genes from diverse species could reflect the evolutionary specialization of duplicated gene family members which appears to have taken slightly different functions over evolutionary time and can account in part for the differences in pa and anthocyanin accumulation patterns in these species.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, our results support the conclusion that tc-mybpa from cacao is involved in regulation of transcription of several pa biosynthesis genes. this is based on several lines of evidence. first, protein sequence comparison showed that tc-mybpa was most similar to the grape pa transcriptional regulator vvmybpa <dig> and shared the conserved motifs of all the other functionally characterized r2r3-myb pa synthesis regulators. second, transcript profiling showed that tc-mybpa was expressed in all tissues accumulating pas and consistently co-regulated with pa biosynthesis structural genes including tcanr, tcans and tclar. third, over-expression of tc-mybpa in arabidopsis was able to functionally complement the pa-deficient phenotype in the seeds of the tt <dig> mutant and resulted in a significant increase of pa accumulation compared to the tt <dig> mutant. this was the result of activation of the pa biosynthetic genes including dfr, ldox and anr as shown by gene expression analysis of transgenic plants relative to untransformed tt <dig> and col- <dig> plants.
