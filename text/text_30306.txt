BACKGROUND
transcriptional activation of the human interferon β  gene is governed by an enhancer, termed the enhanceosome. this enhancer is located in the human genome on chromosome  <dig> and forms a region of length  <dig> bp, which is  <dig> bp upstream of ifn- β. the enhanceosome is one of the best studied enhancers  <cit> . it is an excellent example of combinatorial interaction between distinct regulatory elements. this enhancer is bound by nf- κb , atf-2/c-jun and interferon regulatory factor  proteins. the first two proteins are heterodimers. all together these transcriptional activators have well characterized eight binding sites in the enhanceosome ; see  <cit>  for a review. nf- κb and atf-2/c-jun proteins recognize two positive regulatory domains : prd ii and prd iv, respectively, while irfs recognize the other two domains: prd i and prd iii. notably, many neighbouring binding sites in the enhanceosome overlap.

the process of activation of interferon β is quite intricate and highly ordered as described for example in  <cit> . since  <dig> high resolution crystal structures that concern portions of the enhanceosome with portions of relevant transcription factors are known . as a result of molecular dynamics simulations of different motif combinations of the enhanceosome it was argued  <cit>  that the specificity of the enhancer is attained in this case via cooperative binding of the neighbouring partners.

it was proposed by arnosti and kulkarni  <cit>  that enhancers exhibit a wide spectrum of adopted constraints put on the structure of their transcription factor  binding sites, ranging from those with a very flexible structure, termed billboards, and ending up in enhancers with a very rigid structure, whose primary example is the enhanceosome. rigidity of the enhanceosome shows up when one changes the arrangement of the transcription factor binding sites  of the involved transcriptional activators of ifn- β: even slight change in distance or orientation of tfbs results in a dramatic drop of the activity of gene expression  <cit> .

in addition to the above mentioned transcriptional activators, an important role in fine tuning the specificity in gene expression is played by architectural proteins of the mammalian high mobility group hmg i  <cit> . hmg i and hmg y are alternative rna splicing variants encoded by the same gene. it is known that the role of hmg i proteins in the first step of enhanceosome assembly is the recruitment of nf- κb and atf-2/c-jun by allosteric changes induced in the dna  <cit> . however, in the second step, upon completion of the enhanceosome assembly process, it is required that hmg i proteins form protein-protein interactions with the activators. hmg i proteins have three binding sites in positive regulatory domains of the enhanceosome: two in prd iv, and one in prd ii, which we refer to as hmg-a, hmg-b and hmg-c, respectively.

the functional role of the involved tfs on the level of expression of ifn- β is not precisely determined yet. for example it has been recently reported  <cit>  that the role of these tfs is not so symmetrical as one might expect. the authors report that the role of irfs is critical for the expression of inf- β when performing an experiment in a transgenic mouse, but it is not so with the nf- κb subunits . in another work in the same vein  <cit>  it has been reported that the ifn- β enhanceosome region is not sufficient for maximal gene induction in response to stimulation with bacterial lipopolysaccharide . this study also identified a cluster of nf- κb sites in the 3’ downstream region of the gene.

given the above remarks, we set out a hypothesis that smaller subunits of the enhanceosome may entail tf complex formation in other regulatory regions. more specifically we want to investigate which dimers  involved in enhanceosome assembly  are preferably used in other regulatory elements.

in order to address these questions we applied taco  <cit> , our recently developed tool to predict tf dimers from dna sequence by incorporating position weight matrices  and information about regions of open chromatin. the selection of statistically overrepresented dimer structures  is done in a cell-type–specific manner, as described earlier  <cit> . here, we consider  <dig> transfac motifs  <cit>  that represent transcriptional activators and hmg i binding affinities with hits in the enhanceosome. we also used in this experiment dnase-seq data for  <dig> human cell types. we found  <dig> dimer predictions that matched the positioning on the enhanceosome with ± <dig> bp tolerance.

analysis of the above mentioned computational experiment suggests the following key observations:  among transcriptional activators only the irf proteins form a homodimer that is utilized on a genome-wide scale,  all other predicted dimers involve hmg i proteins and atf-2/c-jun or irf transcription factors,  the majority of dimer instances is located within introns of genes.

we also repeated the same experiment with mouse genome and mouse dnase-seq data for  <dig> cell types. in this case,  <dig> predictions matched those present in the mouse enhanceosome with ± <dig> bp tolerance. the key observations for the mouse enhanceosome are similar to the above observations for human. a noticeable relation linking predictions in human and in mouse is that even though the latter form a subset of the former, every predicted dimer structure in mouse is also predicted in human with exactly the same arrangement. it is also noteworthy that genes that contain predicted dimer instances in human and in mouse have similar go term annotations .

RESULTS
predicted dimers in various cell types
for our experiment we selected  <dig> transfac pwms that represent proteins which are involved in enhanceosome assembly . figure  <dig> presents the enhanceosome sequence together with positions and orientation of the pwm hits along that sequence. among all predictions returned by taco, some did not match the structure of the dimer binding the enhanceosome as known from the literature. since the 3d structure of the enhanceosome may have slightly affected the offset of the involved dimers through allosteric effects, in selecting the predictions we allowed a ± <dig> bp margin on the predicted offset with respect to the offset derived from the published enhanceosome structure. in this way we ended up with  <dig> predictions for the human enhanceosome . a similar table with mouse predictions was also obtained .
fig.  <dig> motif hits along the enhanceosome sequence. for the selected  <dig> transfac pwms, their hits  are presented along the enhanceosome sequence. colored rectangles represent binding sites of the enhanceosome activators as reported by  <cit> . it should be noted that in most cases a pwm represents binding affinity for a dimer



in human the total number of different predicted dimer structures was  <dig>  while for mouse it was  <dig>  they covered  <dig> for human, and  <dig> for mouse cell types. one human cell type  had  <dig> different dimers predicted . in mouse the cell type with the largest number of predicted dimers  was treg .

following the positions of hits in the enhanceosome we grouped our predictions into four groups: hmg-a; atf <dig> , atf2; hmg-b , and irf-b; hmg-c . figure  <dig> shows positions of predicted dimers mapped to the enhanceosome sequence; it also shows the above mentioned four groups of predicted dimers. note that  <dig> of these  <dig> genome-wide overrepresented dimer structures were characterized by a motif spacing  <dig> bp tighter than in the original enhanceosome.

in boldface are indicated the dimers that were also predicted in mouse. numbers in parentheses show the number of cell types in which the dimer was predicted



it is interesting to notice that in both cases when a given dimer type was predicted in the largest number of cell types  the cell types related to a given dimer are very much the same. table  <dig> illustrates this situation – all rows, except the last two, are identical. a very similar property holds for the dimer type irf-a; irf-b .
note that m-cd14+_ro <dig> is an abbreviation for monocytes-cd14+_ro01746



predicted dimer binding sites are enriched in regulatory states
in order to check whether positions of instances of predicted dimers are enriched in chromatin states associated with regulatory function, we used the data deposited from the encode project for broad chromhmm  <cit> . in this version there are chromhmm data  available for  <dig> human cell types, out of which four cell types were present in our study: gm <dig>  hmec, huvec and k <dig>  in total,  <dig> dimers were predicted in the above mentioned cell types .


predictions are referred to by their hypothesis_id number. for a given cell type the data from chromhmm for that cell type assigns, to each position in open chromatin, one of the  <dig> possible hmm states that describe predicted state of activity for that position. a dimer instance may have more than one state assigned to the genomic locus it covers. in order to assign a unique state to each instance, we decided to choose the state of the midpoint of the instance as representative.

in order to help assessing whether dimer instances are enriched in regulatory states related to promoter/enhancer elements we divided the set of all states into two groups: g-plus group consisting of: ‘strong_enhancer’, ‘active_promoter’, ‘weak_promoter’, and ‘weak_enhancer’, with g-minus consisting of the remaining states. figure  <dig> shows a histogram of chromhmm states assigned to dimer occurrences, where group g-minus forms one category, and g-plus is split into four subgroups, as indicated above. it is quite clear that overwhelming majority of dimer instances is assigned a regulatory state in g-plus. in order to assess a p-value of obtaining at least that many occurrences in g-plus group, this could be considered as a binomial process. a more detailed statistics is given in .
fig.  <dig> breakdown of chromhmm states with respect to dimer occurrences. for each predicted dimer in four human cell types: huvec, k <dig>  hmec, and gm <dig>  a breakdown is shown between chromhmm regulatory states , split into four groups, and the remaining states that compose the g-minus group. x-axis shows the number of dimer occurrences



dimer instances are mainly located within introns
next we investigated how far are located predicted dimer instances with respect to a nearest gene. table  <dig> shows, for each predicted dimer, the total number of instances  and the number of instances that are located within a gene. it clearly follows from that table that for all dimers most of their instances are located within a gene, which must be an intron, since we have masked all the exons. distribution of the distances from a dimer instance to the closest gene is shown in fig.  <dig>  observe that dimer instances that are not located within a gene are rather far from the nearest gene . same observation holds for mouse as well, but here the spectrum of medians is bit smaller, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> kbp.
fig.  <dig> distribution of distances from a dimer instance to the closest gene. for each predicted dimer in human cell types, the distribution of basepair distances from a dimer instance to the closest gene is shown as a boxplot. grouping of dimers into dimer types is indicated. the boxplots for dimers that were predicted both in human and in mouse are shown in green



dimer instances located near transcription start site of a gene are enriched for being part of a computationally predicted enhancer
as an additional sanity check, we selected all  <dig> human genes that contain within  <dig> kb for their transcription start site  at least one instance of a predicted dimer. we restricted our attention to only those genes that contain at least three instances within the  <dig> kb distance from their tss. in this way we reduced the number of genes to  <dig>  next we applied a computational tool, billboard  <cit> , to predict enhancers within the  <dig> kb area around tss of each of the  <dig> genes. the salient feature of billboard is that, with the help of an informant species, it discovers evolutionarily conserved arrangements of tfbs. within a short window  arbitrary permutations of tfbss are allowed. for this experiment we chose five informant species: mouse, rat, macaque, opossum, and chicken. of the  <dig> human genes, six did not have any ortholog in any of the five informant species, so they had to be removed from further analysis. the remaining  <dig> genes had in total  <dig> dimer instances within ± <dig> kb of the tss. we run billboard on these  <dig> human genes to find positions of predicted enhancers. as a result  <dig> dimer instances  ended up within a predicted enhancer . on average, the number of informant species supporting a given billboard prediction was  <dig> . additional file  <dig> contains information about the selected human genes and the outcome of this computational experiment.

gene ontology enrichment of dimer selected genes
in order to elucidate a potential regulatory function of predicted dimers we investigated genes which are located in the neighbourhood of dimer instances. a gene is said to be selected by a dimer instance if it is the closest gene to that instance: either the instance is located within the gene, or else the distance between the midpoint of the instance and the closest nucleotide position within the gene is minimal . we group the selected genes, for a given dimer, into  <dig> sets: those that contain an instance of the dimer within its introns , and those located within  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  bp from an instance of the dimer are denoted q <dig>  q <dig>  q <dig>  q <dig>  q <dig>  and q <dig>  respectively.

in addition to this, we also performed for each dimer a global analysis consisting of taking as qx  set union of all sets qx over all considered cell types.

below we discuss enriched go terms for dimer selected genes, separately for each of the four dimer types. we mainly focus on q <dig> sets of genes since for these genes there were the most statistically significant go enrichment terms. here we consider all go enriched terms for all gene categories having enrichment with fdr rate < <dig>  . under this threshold there were no enriched terms for the dimers of type irf-b; hmg-c.

for dimers of type hmg-a; atf <dig> there were only  <dig> cell types with many enriched terms for genes in set q <dig> , all of them being blood microvascular endothelial cells. the biological process  enriched terms for q <dig> genes selected by dimers of this type are: ‘regulation of rho protein signal transduction’, ‘focal adhesion assembly’, ‘regulation of phosphate metabolic process’, ‘establishment or maintenance of cell polarity’, and ‘actin cytoskeleton organization’. for cellular component  domain the enriched terms include: ‘focal adhension’, ‘cytoskeleton’, ‘cell cortex’, ‘neuron projection’, and ‘cell-cell junction’. finally, for molecular function  domain we have the following enriched terms: ‘cytoskeletal protein binding’, ‘ras/rho guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity’, and ‘protein tyrosine kinase activity’. it is also noticeable that the set of genes located within  <dig> bp of a dimer instance  has enriched a bp term ‘positive regulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of stat protein’. as an illustration, fig.  <dig> shows a complete set of enriched go terms for just one dimer  of type hmg-a; atf <dig> for all the  <dig> human cell types that this dimer was predicted.
fig.  <dig> heat map for gene ontology enriched terms. enriched gene ontology terms associated with genes that contain instances of the dimer m00750; m <dig>  shown as a heatmap. this dimer is of type hmg-a; atf <dig>  we show enrichment p-values for the global instances  and for each of the  <dig> human cell types in which the dimer was predicted



an interesting collection of enriched terms is for genes selected by dimers of type atf2; hmg-b. for bp domain the enriched terms include: ‘axon guidance’, ‘cell junction assembly’, ‘regulation of signal transduction’, ‘transmembrane receptor protein tyrosine kinase signalling pathway’, ‘wound healing’, and ‘actin filament organization’. enriched go terms for cc domain include: ‘neuron projection’, ‘adherence junction’, and ‘actin cytoskeleton’, while terms for mf domain are: ‘actin binding’, and ‘rho/ras guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity’.

the third dimer type, irf-a; irf-b, does not have a very pronounced set of enriched terms for q <dig> genes. instead it has an interesting set of enriched terms for q2–q <dig> sets of genes. notably, the bp enriched term ‘isg15-protein conjugation’ is enriched for all queries q1–q <dig>  a bp term ‘negative regulation of type i interferon production’ is enriched for many cell types. likewise the bp terms ‘defense response to virus’, ‘defense response to other organism’, and ‘nls-bearing protein import into nucleus’ are enriched for q <dig> and q <dig> queries. also query q <dig> has a very wide spectrum of bp enriched terms. these are mainly involved in defense response and in the adaptive immune system.

enriched go terms for q <dig> and q <dig> selected genes are similar between human and mouse
in order to assess similarity of enriched terms between human and mouse we performed the following experiment. for a given dimer d that was predicted in human and mouse cell types we consider all pairs of cell types  such that d was predicted in human cell type ch, as well as in mouse cell type cm. for i= <dig> …, <dig>  let gh denote the qi selected genes that are also selected by dimer d in ch. in a similar way we define genes gm selected in cm. let tgh and tgm denote the set of all go terms enriched for genes in gh and in gm, respectively. we assess statistical significance of the intersection of these two sets by performing fisher’s exact test, considering as universe the set of all go terms that can be assigned to human or mouse genes, correspondingly.

we address here only dimers of type hmg-a; atf <dig> and irf-a; irf-b. only go terms for genes selected by q <dig> and q <dig> queries had statistically significant intersections between human and mouse. table  <dig> contains mean values for these distributions. we also present there p-values for fisher’s exact test for global instances for each dimer and each pair of cell types . it clearly follows from that table that enriched go terms for q <dig> selected human and mouse genes are quite similar to each other for dimers of type hmg-a; atf <dig>  it is less so for dimers of type irf-a; irf-b and for q <dig> selected genes, but still in some cases the enriched terms are reasonably similar.p-values  for the fisher’s exact test for similarity of go terms enriched for human and mouse selected genes. here we report only q <dig> and q <dig> selected genes

column ‘p-value q <dig> global’ refers to p-value of fisher’s exact test for globaly selected genes . column ‘best q <dig> p-value’ shows minus log to the base  <dig> of the best reported p-value, names in brackets are cell types in human/mouse for which this p-value was achieved. same explanation applies to q <dig>  here are the abbreviations of the cell type names:  hdl = hmvec-dly-neo, hda = hmvec-dad, hlb = hmvec-lbl, hll = hmvec-lly, gm = gm <dig>  cd = cd2+_ro <dig>  mon = monocytes-cd14+_ro <dig>  thw = th2_wb54553204;   <dig> = 416b, spl = spleen, ch = ch <dig>  thy = thymus, tra = treg-activated, tr = treg, bcl = b-cell_



q <dig> and q <dig> selected genes for human and mouse are in close homology
in the same spirit we assessed similarity of genes selected by the same dimer in human and in mouse. here we have to preprocess the data so that fisher’s exact test is applicable. given a dimer d and selected genes: gh, in human and gm, in mouse, the main issue is how to interpret intersection of gh and gm. for this end, we use orthology relation between human and mouse genes. since this relation is of many-to-many kind, it follows that we should take the smallest partition of gh and the smallest partition of gm, so that if two genes g <dig> g <dig> in one set are orthologs to a common gene in another set, then g <dig> g <dig> belong to the same block of the partition. see methods section for a more detailed description. now, intersection between gh and gm is interpreted as the number of partition blocks, say of gh, that have a corresponding partition block in gm related by at least one orthology relation between members of these blocks. the universe is then taken as the number of equivalence classes in the set union of human and mouse genes.

discussion
of the  <dig> predicted dimers in the human enhanceosome,  <dig> dimers were constructed from an architectural protein of high mobility group i  and one of the two transcriptional activators: atf-2/c-jun and interferon regulatory factor . in total these heterodimers fall into three types, depending on their binding location in the enhanceosome: the leftmost enhanceosome binding position of hmg i  with atf-2/c-jun, atf-2/c-jun with the middle enhanceosome binding position of hmg i , and irf with the rightmost enhanceosome binding position of hmg i . the remaining  <dig> dimers constituted homodimeric arrangement of irf with itself. it is remarkable that nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer complex of activated b cells  did not show up in this analysis. it should be kept in mind that dimers predicted by taco are only those that show overepresentation in terms of binding instances in a particular cell type over the background. hence, if a certain dimer was not predicted it does not mean that this dimer configuration is not plausible.

in total the dimers were predicted in  <dig> human cell types: two from encode tier  <dig> , three from encode tier  <dig> , and the rest of cell types are from encode tier  <dig>  most of the cells with predicted dimers are from blood tissues: monocytes, b cells, b-lymphocyte, t cells, t regulatory cells, and t helper cells – all of them of normal karyotype, but also some diseased cells, mainly leukemia . it is noticeable that for all types of dimers, except atf2; hmg-b, the predicted cell types that contain the dimer are mainly blood cells. for both dimers of type atf2; hmg-b the predicted cell types are leukemia , prostate , and epithelium .

we also performed a similar analysis in mouse cell types. we have found  <dig> dimers present in  <dig> cell types. it is remarkable that the structure  of all these dimers matched exactly the structure of dimers predicted in human. it is also noticeable that the  <dig> dimers predicted both in human and in mouse exhibit the highest number of human cells containing them.

interestingly,  <dig> dimer structures predicted in human out of  <dig>  were characterized by a motif spacing  <dig> bp tighter than in the original enhanceosome. what is more interesting is that the remaining  <dig> dimers  are all of the same type hmg-a; atf <dig> and are therefore located on the enhanceosome leftmost side of the sequence. all of the above mentioned  <dig> dimer structures are located inside the enhanceosome. an additional support that we are not discussing here is that the above mentioned  <dig> dimers are predicted in mouse with exactly the same offset, and the other  <dig> mouse dimers, having the same offset as in human, turn out to be  <dig> bp tighter than in the original mouse enhanceosome. a possible mechanistic explanation of this phenomenon is that a  <dig> bp wider offset between tfs that are located inside of the big protein complex which binds the enhanceosome is caused by the overall three-dimensional structure of the complex, with weaker constraints imposed on the sides of the enhanceosome complex.

as a sanity check we investigated chromhmm states assigned to genomic dimer instances. in an overwhelming number of cases these instances were assigned to an enhancer or promoter state. more than half of the instances are located within a gene . moreover, using an enhancer annotation tool, billboard, we searched the ± <dig> kb area around tss of human genes that contain at least three dimer instances. with help of five informant species, we concluded that in  <dig> % of the  <dig> instances they were included in a predicted enhancer. this supports the hypothesis that the predicted dimers, being part of the human enhanceosome, are also utilized in the genome by other enhancers.

in order to analyze genes which contain in their vicinity a dimer instance, we defined  <dig> groups, which we call queries: genes containing a dimer instance , and queries q <dig> through q <dig> that consist of genes that the closest distance to a dimer instance is less than  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  <dig>   <dig> , and  <dig>  base pairs. next, for each dimer we performed gene ontology analysis for each of the above mentioned queries. we have also compared enriched go terms for similarity between human and mouse. the performed fisher’s exact test suggests that the enriched terms for queries q <dig> and q <dig> are significantly similar between human and mouse. even stronger similarity is observed for comparison of human/mouse genes selected by these two queries. for this we adopted fisher’s exact test by utilizing the orthology relation between human and mouse genes.

CONCLUSIONS
we have performed a comprehensive search of overrepresented dimers composed of transcription factors that constitute the human enhanceosome. we searched over many cell types, both in human and in mouse. the predicted dimers were grouped into  <dig> types, according to their binding position in the enhanceosome: hmg-a; atf <dig>  atf2; hmg-b, irf-a; irf-b, and irf-b; hmg-c. here hmg-{a, b, c} represents three binding sites of the architectural protein hmg i in the enhanceosome. no other combinations of tfs and/or architectural proteins were predicted. the majority of cell types in which these dimers were discovered were various kinds of blood tissues.

despite the fact that we allowed for dimer spacing variability up to ± <dig> bp comparing to the enhancesome sequence, most of the predicted dimers were exactly  <dig> bp wider than suggested by the motifs within the enhanceosome. the remaining  <dig> dimer predictions were of the same type hmg-a; atf <dig>  located on the side of the enhanceosome. since in most of the cases the predicted dimer binding sites were associated with a state of regulatory character, we assumed that the role of these dimers is being a part of enhancers other than the enhanceosome. we observe that dimer instances are preferentially located within introns of genes and that those instances that are located near tss of a gene are preferentially included in computationally predicted enhancers .

gene ontology analysis for the groups of genes that are located near dimer binding sites shows that these dimers are possibly involved in various kinds of activities: the first two types seem to be involved in regulation of signal transduction and in ras guanyl-nucleotide exchange factor activity. on the other hand, the third type of dimers is mainly involved in defense response and in the adaptive immune system. predicted dimers for mouse, even though they form a subset of those in human, have similar properties. the enriched gene ontology terms for the corresponding human and mouse genes are similar. also the corresponding genes, related by orthology relation, are similar between human and mouse.
