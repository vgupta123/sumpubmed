BACKGROUND
poly-adp-ribosylation reactions occur both in multi- and unicellular organisms and play a major role in a wide range of biological processes, such as maintenance of genomic stability, transcriptional regulation and cell death . the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of poly-adp-ribose was named poly-adp-ribose polymerase  . for a long time, parp- <dig> was thought to be the only enzyme with poly-adp-ribosylation activity in mammalian cells; however, primary cells derived from parp- <dig> knockout mice can still synthesize poly-adp-ribose polymers after dna damage  <cit> . this led to the identification of five novel poly-adp-ribosylating enzymes, indicating that parp- <dig> belongs to a family of at least six members . parp- <dig> and parp- <dig> can homo- and heterodimerize and display partially redundant functions as indicated by the embryonic lethality of the parp1-parp2-double gene disruption .

mouse parp- <dig> was described as a  <dig> kda nuclear protein with poly-adp-ribosylating activity  <cit> . the amino-terminal region of parp- <dig> , containing the dna binding sap domain, has no significant homology with any other parp  <cit> . however, it is rich in basic amino acids , which are likely to be involved in dna binding . on the other hand, these basic residues could be involved in the nuclear and/or nucleolar targeting of the protein  <cit> . previous studies suggested that the nuclear localization signal  of mparp- <dig> is indeed located in the amino-terminal part between aa 1– <dig> of the protein  <cit> . meder et al. postulated a bipartite nls for parp- <dig>  but did not provide further experimental evidences to support their hypothesis  <cit> . interestingly, the amino-terminal region of human and mouse parp- <dig> shows higher sequence variability compared to the highly conserved carboxy-terminal catalytic region . in cells, parp- <dig> has been described to regulate different processes via protein-protein interactions mediated by its amino-terminal domain .

karyopherins, including both importins and exportins, consitute a conserved family of mobile targeting receptors that mediate the bidirectional trafficking of macromolecules across the nuclear envelope  <cit> . most karyopherins interact directly with cargo molecules that contain nuclear import and export signals. however, importin α functions as an adaptor that links classical nls -containing proteins to importin β, which, in turn, docks the ternary complex at the nuclear-pore complex . the importin α/β heterodimer is predicted to target hundreds of proteins to the npc and facilitate their translocation across the nuclear envelope  <cit> . the importin α gene family has undergone considerable expansion during the course of eukaryotic evolution. whereas the yeast s. cerevisiae genome encodes a single importin α, the human genome encodes six genes that fall into three phylogenetically distinct groups  <cit> .

the nuclear targeting signal in the simian virus  <dig>  large t antigen was characterized more than  <dig> years ago  <cit> . since then, several pathways for nucleocytoplasmic transport have been described, of which the classical nuclear import pathway is the best characterized. cnlss are typified by either a single cluster of basic amino acids  or two clusters of basic amino acids separated by a 10– <dig> amino acid linker . the sv <dig> large t antigen  and nucleoplasmin  cnlss are the prototypic monopartite and bipartite cnls  <cit> . through alanine scanning of the myc, monopartite sv <dig>  and artificial bipartite sv <dig> cnls, hodel and colleagues found that the binding affinity of a cnls for importin measured in vitro correlated with the steady state nuclear accumulation and import rate of the corresponding cnls cargo in vivo  <cit> .

here, we demonstrate that lysine  <dig> in the dna binding domain  of parp- <dig>  which lies within a predicted cnls motif, is required for complex formation with the importin proteins and subsequent nuclear import of parp- <dig> 

RESULTS
lysine  <dig> and/or lysine  <dig> of parp- <dig> are required for nuclear translocation of parp-2
previous experiments with gfp-fusion proteins revealed that the nuclear targeting signal of parp- <dig> may be localized between aa 1– <dig> . this region of the protein was previously postulated to contain a bipartite cnls; however, this sequence would be an atypical bipartite cnls as the linker separating the two basic regions is longer than the typical 10– <dig> amino acid linker. this region does contain a predicted monopartite cnls that closely matches the canonical sv <dig> cnls sequence. to assess whether these sequences are important for nuclear translocation of parp- <dig>  mutant forms of parp- <dig>  k19/20r, k36/37r, and k19/20/36/37r, were generated by replacing the lysine residues with arginine residues to maintain the positive charge of the amino acids . to exclude the possibility that these amino acid changes altered the stability of the mutated parp- <dig>  wild type and all mutant forms were expressed as ha-tagged proteins in 293t cells and detected by immunoblot using an anti-ha antibody . immunoblot analysis revealed that all mutants were expressed at a level comparable to wild type parp- <dig> 

the parp- <dig> mutants were transiently transfected and localization was assayed by microscopy of parp- <dig> proteins. while wild type parp- <dig> and the k19/20r mutant localized in the nucleus, the k19/20/36/37r and k36/37r mutants exclusively localized in the cytoplasm . to investigate whether substitution of k <dig> and k <dig> with other amino acids altered the localization of parp- <dig>  similar experiments were repeated with different amino acid susbstitutions. overexpression of parp- <dig> with k19/ <dig>  k36/ <dig> or all four residues mutated to glutamate or methionine showed that k → e or k → m substitution of k36/ <dig>  but not of k19/ <dig> altered the localization of parp- <dig> to a similar extent as the k → r substitution , suggesting that k <dig> and/or k <dig> are required for the nuclear translocation of parp- <dig>  whereas k <dig> and k <dig> did not seem to play a role in this process.

leptomycin b does not change cellular localization of parp- <dig> mutant k36/37r
next, we investigated whether the cytoplasmic localization of the mutated parp- <dig> protein k36/37r is caused by an abrogated nuclear import or by an accelerated nuclear export of a transiently nuclear localized parp- <dig> mutant. cells were transfected with wild type or mutant parp- <dig> and subsequently treated with leptomycin b , a well-characterized inhibitor of crm-1-mediated nuclear export  <cit> . treatment with lmb did not induce any changes in the cellular localization of the parp- <dig> mutant k36/37r , indicating that k <dig> and/or k <dig> are more likely to impact nuclear import of parp- <dig> than a classical nes-mediated export process.

lysine  <dig> but not lysine  <dig> of parp- <dig> is required for nuclear localization of parp-2
in order to further investigate the requirement for k <dig> and k <dig> in the nuclear localization of parp- <dig>  k → r single mutants were created at each position. interestingly, similar experiments performed with the wild type and the single mutants of parp- <dig> possessing k36r and k37r substitutions revealed, that both mutants were stably expressed at levels comparable to wild type parp- <dig> and that only lysine  <dig> was important for the nuclear accumulation of parp- <dig> . in contrast to earlier reports  <cit> , no nucleolar staining was observed under the tested conditions. these experiments identified k <dig> as an important residue for the nuclear localization of parp- <dig> in vivo.

lysine  <dig> is important for binding to importin α3
one possibility to confirm the functional cnls targeting sequence is to perform interaction studies with the classical nls import receptor, importin α. in order to test whether parp- <dig> interacts with importin α, we performed gst pull-down experiments with different recombinant purified gst-fusion proteins of human importin α  and cell extracts containing overexpressed wild type or different mutated parp- <dig> proteins. parp- <dig> was detected in the bound fraction following the pull-down assay by western blot analysis. wild type parp- <dig> formed a complex with importin α <dig> and to a very weak extent also with importin α <dig> and importin α <dig>  but not with importin α <dig> . experiments with purified wild type and mutated parp- <dig>  revealed that the mutant proteins k36/37r and k36r did not bind importin α <dig>  while the k37r mutant did bind, suggesting that k <dig> is a critical residue of parp- <dig> essential for its interaction with importin α <dig> and its nuclear translocation .

discussion
parp- <dig> regulates different cellular functions. here, we provide both biochemical and functional evidence that substitution of lysine residue  <dig> efficiently inhibits localization of parp- <dig> to the nucleus. functional analyses revealed that lysine  <dig> is important for complex formation with importin α <dig> 

lysine residues are central components of classical nls motifs  as their positive charge mediates the interaction with importin receptors  <cit> . here we provide evidence that k <dig> of parp- <dig> is an important residue required for the nuclear translocation of parp- <dig> and for complex formation with importin α <dig>  as mutation of this residue was sufficient to disrupt association with the import machinery and subsequently alter parp- <dig> nuclear localization. interestingly, lysine  <dig> is conserved between mouse and human parp- <dig>  suggesting that the described findings might also apply for the human counterpart. together, our data indicate that the nuclear import of human and murine parp- <dig> is mediated by a conserved classical monopartite nls but not through a bipartite nls as previously proposed  <cit> .

the formation of the importin-α/β-cnls cargo ternary complex is the first step in the nuclear transport of hundreds of different nuclear proteins, and, as such, is tightly regulated  <cit> . the relationship of importin α/β with its cnls cargo is by necessity bipolar, because it forms highly selective and tight complexes in the cytoplasm and then switches to an extremely low affinity state in the nucleus to release the cargo. when importin α is not bound to importin β, an autoinhibitory sequence within the amino-terminal domain apparently interacts with the nls-binding pocket  <cit> . this interaction is not exceptionally strong because cnls cargos can still bind to importin α in the absence of importin β, albeit with significantly lower affinity. the order of importin α binding to cnls cargo and importin β is not known. the observed lack of importin α <dig> binding by the parp- <dig> mutant  clearly indicates that this lysine is required for the interaction with importin α and subsequently for nuclear translocation.

recently, it has become evident that importin α receptors have independent roles in the assembly of macromolecular structures. genetic analyses of yeast importin α mutants identified several alleles that confer defects in chromosome and nuclear segregation, altered mitotic spindle structure and deficits in the ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation pathway  <cit> . mechanistic studies on the roles of importin αs in mitosis, spindle assembly and nuclear envelope biogenesis point more directly to activities which are independent of the housekeeping roles of importin α in nuclear transport. the observed interaction of parp- <dig> with importin α might thus not only be important for its nuclear translocation but might have an additional physiological function in maintaining the integrity of the genome. inactivation of the parp- <dig> gene in mice revealed that parp- <dig> may be involved in the surveillance and maintenance of genome integrity, indicated by the sensitivity of these mice to ionizing radiation  <cit> .

others have reported that parp- <dig> is enriched within the whole nucleolus and partially colocalizes with the nucleolar factor nucleophosmin/b <dig>  <cit> . using partial cdna fragments in-frame with the carboxy-terminus of egfp the authors described a putative nuclear localization signal and a nucleolar localization signal within the amino-terminal domain of parp- <dig> . our studies revealed that overexpressed parp- <dig> was only found equally distributed in the nucleus, but in contradiction to this previous report, was never observed in the nucleolus of the cell. this discrepancy could be explained by the different experimental approaches used. meder et al. studied the nucleolar localization of parp- <dig> with gfp-fusion proteins, while our studies were performed with non-gfp tagged full-length proteins. remarkably, parp- <dig> nucleolar accumulation was not observed when endogenous or overexpressed parp- <dig> localization was analyzed by a conventional immunofluorecence protocol as described in methods using specific anti-parp- <dig> antibodies . only applying the fixation protocol described in meder et al.  <cit> , which led to the decomposition of the cell and loss of cytoplasm, revealed the reported nucleolar staining of parp- <dig>  suggesting that the fixation protocol influences the nucleolar localization of proteins or the detection of proteins within the nucleolus.

recently, acetylation of lysine residues by histone acetyltransferases , such as p300/cbp  and pcaf , has been proposed as a new mechanism for modulating cellular localization  <cit> . hats trigger the transfer of an acetyl group from acetyl coenzyme a to the epsilon-amino group of a lysine residue not only on core histones but also on about  <dig> transcription factors and on more than  <dig> other proteins  <cit> . we recently published that both lysines  <dig> and  <dig> of parp- <dig> are indeed acetylated in vitro and in vivo and that acetylation influences both dna binding and auto-adp-ribosylation of parp- <dig>  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
taken together, our results provide evidence that parp- <dig> accumulates in the nucleus and that lysine  <dig>  which is located within a monopartite cnls, is important for binding of parp- <dig> to importin α <dig> and for the nuclear translocation of parp- <dig>
