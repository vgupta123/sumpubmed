BACKGROUND
nontyphoidal salmonella is a zoonotic agent of significant food and feed safety concerns. in the united states, an estimated  <dig> million cases of foodborne salmonellosis occur each year, resulting in the highest numbers of hospitalizations and deaths among  <dig> major pathogens  <cit> . salmonella also represented the leading cause of foodborne disease outbreaks during 1998– <dig>  with 77 % of illnesses broadly attributed across multiple food commodities, including produce, eggs, poultry, and meats  <cit> . moreover, salmonella remains a major microbial hazard in animal feed and pet food  <cit> . the safety of these feed commodities impacts not only animal health but also the health of humans consuming foods of animal origin or handling pet food  <cit> . for instance, several multistate outbreaks of human salmonellosis linked to tainted pet food have been reported recently  <cit> .

to reduce salmonella outbreaks and illnesses associated with food and feed products, a multifaceted approach from farm to table is required. methods that can quickly and reliably detect salmonella in these commodities are especially valuable in order to promptly identify contamination problems along the production chain. however, rapid, reliable, and robust detection of salmonella in food and feed remains elusive  <cit> . conventional culture methods are reliable but time consuming and labor intensive, taking days even weeks for a definitive result  <cit> . a growing number of molecular methods, including pcr and real-time quantitative pcr  have been developed and applied to detect salmonella in a variety of food and feed products . despite being rapid, specific, and sensitive, pcr-based nucleic acid amplification tests  require a sophisticated thermal cycling instrument and are also susceptible to inhibitors in food and feed matrices  <cit> , limiting their wider application.

recently, an isothermal naat termed loop-mediated isothermal amplification  has emerged as a promising alternative to pcr for the detection of salmonella in food . lamp employs four to six specially designed primers and a strand-displacing bst dna polymerase to amplify up to  <dig> copies of target dna within an hour  <cit> . two distinct advantages of lamp over pcr are running at a constant temperature  and tolerance to assay inhibitors  <cit> , which eliminate the need for a thermocycler or complicated sample preparation steps. other attractive features of lamp include high specificity, sensitivity, speed, and robustness  <cit> . nonetheless, lamp has not yet been evaluated in feed samples, which encompass a group of rather diverse and complex matrices.

efficient sample analysis with lamp depends not only on the performance of dna amplification but also the method used for monitoring the reaction  <cit> . to date, multiple techniques have been used to detect lamp products, including naked eye, gel electrophoresis, turbidity, fluorescence, among others  <cit> . bioluminescent monitoring of lamp products was demonstrated recently via a novel reporter, bioluminescent assay in real-time   <cit> . in essence, bart monitors the inorganic pyrophosphate produced during the lamp reaction by converting it to atp which is simultaneously utilized by firefly luciferase to emit light  <cit> . the time needed to reach peak light output is reflective of the concentration of original target dna; therefore, lamp-bart allows real-time quantification with a simple, portable light detector  <cit> . when applied in detecting genetically modified maize, lamp-bart was shown to be an effective and sensitive technique with significant potential for quantification  <cit> . a commercially available 3m molecular detection assay  salmonella  also builds upon the lamp-bart technology.

in this study, we aimed to develop and optimize an in-house salmonella lamp-bart assay and to apply the assay in various types of food and feed samples. the assay’s performance was compared with that of a conventional lamp assay and the commercially available 3m mda salmonella.

RESULTS
the optimized lamp-bart assay
the final lamp-bart reaction mix in a total volume of 25 μl contained all core reagents listed in the methods section and two  and trehalose) out of the four facilitators evaluated. kcl was excluded from the mixture due to significantly greater tmax values when added individually or in combination with other facilitators . dithiothreitol  was not included since it did not improve the overall assay performance in terms of tmax values or false positive rates. it is noteworthy that trehalose, when added alone or together with other facilitators, consistently gave the optimum assay performance. fig.  <dig> shows the amplification graphs when running the assays with the optimized reagent mix compared to the prototypic one. besides decreased tmax values , the light intensity was also greater using the optimized mix.fig.  <dig> lamp-bart amplification graphs generated when running the assays with optimized or prototypic reagent mixes. samples  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> were run using optimized and prototypic  <cit>  reagent mixes, respectively. sample  <dig> to  <dig> and  <dig> to  <dig> were water samples run using the optimized and prototypic mixes, respectively



assay specificity
all three assays  demonstrated 100 % specificity when testing the  <dig> bacterial strains. for the  <dig> salmonella strains of  <dig> serovars, the mean tmax values ranged from  <dig>  to 17 min with an average of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  min by lamp-bart and from  <dig>  to 27 min with an average of 18 ±  <dig>  min by 3m mda salmonella, whereas the mean tt values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  min with an average of 15 ±  <dig>  min by conventional lamp. the overall ranking of assay rapidity was lamp-bart > conventional lamp > 3m mda salmonella . for the  <dig> non-salmonella strains, no tmax or tt value was obtained, suggesting negative results by all three assays.

assay sensitivity and quantification capability


based on the standard curves generated , linear relationships were observed for templates ranging from  <dig>  ×  <dig> to  <dig>  × 102 cfu/reaction with correlation coefficients  at  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for lamp-bart, conventional lamp, and 3m mda salmonella, respectively. when taking into consideration the 36 cfu/reaction level, the r <dig> values dropped to  <dig>  and  <dig>  for conventional lamp and 3m mda salmonella, respectively, but increased to  <dig>  for lamp-bart .

rapid and sensitive detection of salmonella in spiked food and feed samples
all of the uninoculated controls tested negative for salmonella . aerobic plate counts among food types averaged 102-103 cfu/g in cantaloupe and tomato, 104 cfu/g in ground beef and ground turkey, and non-detectable  in shell eggs. among feed types, the aerobic plate counts averaged 102 cfu/g in dog food, 103 cfu/g in chicken feed, and 104 cfu/g in cattle feed.

table  <dig> summarizes the sensitivity of all three assays when testing 10-fold serial dilutions of salmonella strains of various serovars in spiked food and feed samples based on three independent repeats. in the majority of food types, the detection limits for lamp-bart and conventional lamp were around 2 × 104 cfu per 25 g  except in ground turkey and ground beef, for which the detection limits were 10-fold higher. in one or two out of three repeats, conventional lamp and lamp-bart, respectively, achieved positive results in ground beef at the 2× 104 cfu/25 g level. the 3m mda salmonella assay was capable of detecting 104 cfu per 25 g in shell eggs and tomato in some repeats but required at least 105 cfu/25 g in cantaloupe and ground beef and as high as 108 cfu/25 g in ground turkey. in feed samples, regardless of feed type, all three assays required at least 105 cfu/25 g for detection and 106 cfu/25 g was consistently needed to detect salmonella newport  <dig> h in cattle feed by 3m mda salmonella .table  <dig> the sensitivity of lamp-bart, conventional lamp, and 3m mda salmonella in spiked food and feed samples based on three independent repeats

discussion
coupling a promising isothermal naat with a novel bioluminescent reporter, the salmonella lamp-bart assay developed in this study was rapid , specific , sensitive , quantitative , and robust . after 24 h enrichment, the assay accurately detected 1–3 cfu/25 g of salmonella in all food/feed types tested except cattle feed. this is the first study evaluating lamp-bart for salmonella detection in a large variety of food and feed samples.

previously, the lamp-bart combination has been successfully explored in detecting chlamydia trachomatis, clostridium difficile, and gmo  and forms the basis of several commercially available 3m mdas  <cit> . a major advantage of bart over fluorescence or turbidity monitoring of lamp reactions is the requirement of rather simple, robust, and low-cost hardware. for instance, a portable photodiode-based reader  was used in the c. trachomatis, c. difficile, and gmo studies . in the present study, the assay was conducted in a one-step, closed-tube format in the 3m mds <dig> instrument providing temperature control  for lamp and bioluminescence readings for bart simultaneously. this feature of bart may potentially lead to the development of field-deployable assays that can be used in resource-limited areas.

the lamp portion of the assay was essentially the same as the conventional lamp included for comparison, which used slightly modified primer sequences  from those published previously  <cit> . these modifications were necessary based on preliminary evaluation of the combined lamp-bart performance . it is notable that multiple lamp assays have been recently developed and applied in detecting salmonella in food, and reported to be rapid, specific, and sensitive . the inva-based lamp was chosen in this study as the prototype for assay development and comparison purposes since it has been extensively evaluated in eggs and produce, and for robustness and comparison with qpcr  <cit> .table  <dig> primers used for detecting salmonella by lamp-bart and conventional lamp, in comparison with the primer set published previously

besides lamp reagents, the optimized lamp-bart reaction mix contained four essential reagents for bart  and atp sulfurylase to convert inorganic pyrophosphate produced during the lamp reaction to atp, and luciferin and firefly luciferase to utilize atp to generate light) and two  out of four facilitators  described previously  <cit> . this is the first study evaluating the effects of these facilitators on lamp-based assays. in pcr reactions, both dtt and trehalose enhanced amplification efficiency by stabilizing the taq dna polymerase, while trehalose also lowered dna melting temperature  <cit> . pvp has been shown to enhance pcr by reversing the inhibitory effect of polyphenolic contaminants  <cit> . increasing kcl concentrations in the pcr buffer has been reported to cause preferential amplification of shorter dnas as longer dnas denatured slower due to the stabilizing effect of potassium ions on the double-stranded structure  <cit> . our data suggested the inclusion of pvp and trehalose but not dtt or kcl. notably, the intermediate and final lamp products are a mixture of stem-loop dnas with various stem lengths  <cit> . the amplification of longer ones was likely inhibited by increased kcl in the mix, as indicated by significantly greater tmax values when kcl was added.

in pure-culture testing, all three assays  possessed similar specificity and sensitivity. lamp-bart was consistently faster than conventional lamp, while 3m mda salmonella was the slowest. besides tmax , the time to the first inflexion point of the curve  could also be used to characterize the lamp-bart amplification kinetics  <cit> , further shortening the time taken to report positive results. the finding of 100 % specificity among  <dig> bacterial strains including all six subspecies of s. enterica and s. bongori corroborated previous reports on multiple salmonella lamp assays using various collections of bacterial strains . the detection limit of 36 cfu/reaction also fell within the range  reported previously for multiple salmonella lamp assays . the three lamp-bart assays described recently had detection limits of  <dig>  copies of c. trachomatis dna,  <dig> copies of c. difficile dna, and  <dig> copies of gmo target, respectively . however, the detection limit of 3m mda salmonella in pure culture has not been reported.

different from the sigmoidal shape typical of fluorescence and turbidity measurements, lamp-bart possessed unique assay kinetics as shown in the bell-shape light output curves , possibly leading to better quantification capability  <cit> . the chlamydia lamp-bart assay had an r <dig> of  <dig> for dna templates ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> copies per reaction, but the linearity was greatly compromised for templates below  <dig> copies  <cit> . in the present study, the lamp-bart assay had r <dig> of  <dig>  for salmonella cells ranging from  <dig> to 106 cfu/reaction and the value increased to  <dig>  when the 101 cfu level was added. this was superior to either conventional lamp or 3m mda salmonella. previously, r <dig> for conventional lamp was  <dig>  for salmonella cells ranging from  <dig> to 105 cfu/reaction  <cit> . the 3m mda salmonella was designed to be a qualitative assay, i.e., presence or absence; therefore, its quantification capability has not been examined previously.

among most food/feed types tested, the three assays detected down to 2 ×  <dig> - 2 × 106 cfu/25 g  without enrichment, while 108 cfu/25 g was required by 3m mda salmonella for detection in ground turkey . to our knowledge, this is the first time lamp-based assays were evaluated in various feed samples and the second time in ground beef and ground turkey  <cit> . the reduced sensitivity  observed in these food/feed types suggested that relatively high background flora  and/or complex matrices may have affected the assay performance. in particular, ground turkey with high average apc of 104 cfu/g showed a strong inhibition on the 3m mda salmonella where all matrix control samples returned negative results. a recent study comparing 3m mda salmonella and iso  <dig> for the detection of salmonella in retail meat samples also reported inhibition of the 3m assay by a turkey meat preparation  with many ingredients, possibly due to spice  <cit> . the ground turkey used in the present study contained 7 % fat, which may have negatively influenced the 3m mda salmonella outcome.

coupled with enrichment, the three assays accurately detected 1–3 cfu/25 g of salmonella in all food/feed types tested except in cattle feed when tested by 3m mda salmonella, for which 101 cfu per 25 g was required . the findings in produce and shell eggs agreed with several recent reports on the capability of conventional lamp in detecting low-level salmonella in these food types  <cit> . however, the detection of low-level salmonella in feed samples has not been reported previously. similar to the trend shown in food/feed sensitivity testing, all three assays were less effective  in detecting feed samples than food samples, suggesting matrix effects caused by many ingredients commonly present in feed rations. this effect was even more apparent in cattle feed where only one repeat at the 100 cfu/25 g level was positive by lamp-bart and conventional lamp and none by 3m mda salmonella. another recent study using 3m mda salmonella in water sources also showed it to be less effective than pcr in detecting salmonella  <cit> . it is hypothesized that natural flora present in cattle feed or compounds released during processing may have affected salmonella survival and growth during enrichment, causing the low sensitivity in detection. further studies are warranted to optimize detection in feed commodities. finally, agreeable with pure-culture testing data, lamp-bart was consistently faster than conventional lamp, while 3m mda salmonella was the slowest when food/feed samples were tested.

CONCLUSIONS
the salmonella lamp-bart assay developed in this study was rapid, specific, sensitive, quantitative, and robust. upon further validation including independent validation and collaborative studies, it may become a valuable tool for routine screening of salmonella in various types of food and feed samples.
