BACKGROUND
several studies on reprogramming human somatic cells to induced pluripotent stem cells  have demonstrated that the transduction of only a few transcription factors  is sufficient for resetting differentiated cells into a molecular state similar to embryonic stem cells . while takahashi et al.  <cit>  and wernig et al.  <cit>  obtained ips cells by transduction of the tfs oct <dig>  sox <dig>  klf <dig>  and c-myc, yu et al.  <cit>  achieved similar results with a transcription factor set composed of oct <dig>  sox <dig>  nanog, and lin <dig>  only the tfs oct <dig> and sox <dig> are common in both approaches and huangfu et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that ips cells can be derived at higher efficiencies by the transduction of these two factors in combination with the supplementation with the histone deacetylase inhibitor -valproic acid.

the tf oct <dig> is known as a key regulator for maintaining pluripotency in the mammalian embryo  <cit> . the hmg-box containing tf sox <dig> interacts with oct <dig> and the sox2/oct <dig> heterodimer complex is able to promote selective gene activation or repression during mammalian embryogenesis  <cit> .

functional data on oct <dig> regulatory action is available from heterogeneous sources: to reveal dna-protein binding events of oct <dig>  sox <dig> and of the pluripotency associated tf nanog, chromatin immuno-precipitation followed by microarray experiments  has been performed using hescs  <cit> . additionally, sequence motifs have been identified, for example the octamer motif atttgcat interacting with pou domain factors like the homeodomain containing tf oct <dig> and a motif recognized by the sox2/oct <dig> heterodimer complex  <cit> . mapping of these known transcription factor binding motifs to the promoter sequences of putative oct <dig> target genes provides additional evidence for direct binding events.

although chip-on-chip experiments and sequence-based methods have the ability to detect such putative protein-dna binding sites, these techniques do not allow inference of directional transcriptional dependencies between dna binding and the effect on regulation of gene expression. in order to test the regulatory influence of oct <dig> to the transcription rate of its target genes, babaie et al.  <cit>  performed rna interference-mediated suppression of oct <dig> function in the h <dig> hesc line and analyzed the resulting global gene expression changes by microarray experiments. transcriptional changes induced by oct <dig> knockdown are expected to include genes linked with pluripotency, and genes activated upon differentiation along the trophoblast lineage  <cit> .

chip-on-chip experiments, promoter sequence analysis and rna interference provide complementary pieces of information on transcriptional dependencies. in this study, we performed an integrated analysis of these methods in the context of oct <dig> dependent regulation of pluripotency and differentiation along the trophoblast lineage in hescs in order to construct a core network composed of the genes that were detected by all individual experimental approaches. using this conservative selection, we observed a  <dig> â€“ <dig>  fold increase of functional information content compared to single experiment analysis. in order to extend the analysis of oct <dig> regulation, we performed a comprehensive in silico promoter sequence analysis with the oct <dig> target genes and identified binding sites related to potential co-factors of oct <dig> 

RESULTS
analysis of individual experimental methods
we performed a re-analysis of the oct <dig>  sox <dig> and nanog chip-on-chip data from hescs   <cit>  including the mapping of the  <dig> mer oligonucleotide probes to an updated ncbi build . in total,  <dig>  oligonucleotides matched to their original position  whereas  <dig>  probes were mapped more than  <dig> bp away from their original position. processing of the uniquely-mapped probes includes background correction, normalization, fold-enrichment and peak identification and resulted in  <dig> potential oct <dig> target genes . figure 1b shows a histogram of the distances between binding sites and transcription start sites  for the  <dig> direct oct <dig> target genes. most oct <dig> binding sites  are located less then  <dig> kb upstream of the tss.  <dig> % of all binding sites are located less then  <dig> kb upstream of the tss and a second accumulation of binding sites is observed in the region between - <dig> kb to - <dig> kb with nearly a quarter  of all binding sites.

because protein-dna binding events do not give information on the direction of the regulatory influence of the tf with respect to the transcription rate of its target genes, we complemented the results of the oct <dig> chip-on-chip experiment with the results of the rnai mediated oct <dig> silencing in hescs  performed by babaie et al.  <cit> . identifier mapping of the different chip platforms  resulted in  <dig>  genes that were represented as cdna clones on the microarray  and that had promoter regions covered by the agilent tiling arrays. from the originally published  <dig> oct <dig> target genes  <cit> ,  <dig> were also represented on the cdna microarray. from the  <dig>  genes that show significantly altered expression  <dig> hours after the oct <dig> knock down,  <dig> genes  were also identified as direct oct <dig> target genes.

in order to obtain an even more stringent set of oct <dig> target genes, we searched the promoter sequences of the targets for the occurrence of the known oct4-related octamer and sox-oct joint motifs within a distance of  <dig> kb upstream of the respective tsss . even though we neglect information on binding events caused by oct4-dna interactions mediated by unknown cofactors and heterodimer complexes, our results reflect confirmed functional circuitries dependent on direct oct <dig> and sox-oct binding. the combination of the three approaches resulted in a set of  <dig> genes . nevertheless, it has to be mentioned that a motif could be mapped to the genomic environment of a chip-on-chip derived significant peak  for only a third of these genes, whereas for the remaining genes the genomic position of the mapped motif is further away from the centre of the peaks.

the complete results of the individual studies  are summarized in additional file  <dig> 

positional distribution of oct <dig> transcription factor binding sites 
oct <dig> target genes
among the  <dig> genes, several well-known targets of oct <dig> can be found as well as genes whose regulatory interaction with oct <dig> is less well-described. in general, oct <dig> binds to and regulates diverse classes of genes encoding for example transcription factors , transcriptional regulators , regulators of kinase, transferase, and catalytic activity , members of the wnt receptor signalling pathway , and growth factors . a functional classification of the  <dig> oct <dig> target genes is given in additional file  <dig> 

as an example, figure  <dig> illustrates chip-on-chip data results in the promoter regions of two target genes. figure 3a shows two identified peaks located approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site of cdx <dig> . a binding event was identified for nanog at the same genomic positions but not for sox <dig>  additionally, the octamer motif was found approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. oct <dig> negatively regulates the transcription of cdx <dig>  as it is significantly up-regulated upon oct <dig> knockdown  <cit> . this observation is in line with the function of cdx <dig> which encodes a protein that is important in a broad range of cellular functions such as trophoblast differentiation in human and mouse  <cit>  to maintenance of the intestinal epithelial lining of both the small and large intestine  <cit> . furthermore, it has been shown that oct <dig> directly regulates the expression of cdx <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells  <cit> .

as a second example, figure 3b shows two identified peaks located approximately  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp upstream of the tss of foxd <dig> . binding events were identified for nanog at the same genomic position but not for sox <dig>  the octamer motif was found approximately  <dig> bp upstream of the tss. moreover, oct <dig> has a positive regulatory influence on the transcription of foxd <dig> as it is significantly down-regulated  <dig> hours after rnai mediated oct <dig> depletion  <cit> . this observation is consistent with the function of foxd <dig> in mouse embryonic stem cells, as it is required for maintenance of progenitor cells in the inner cell mass and in the trophoblast  <cit> . additionally, it has been shown that foxd <dig> has an important role in repressing differentiation, promoting self-renewal, and maintaining survival of mouse escs  <cit> .

further evidence for the regulatory influence of oct <dig> on the  <dig> target genes has been agglomerated from published experimental studies. additional file  <dig> contains a glossary for the  <dig> core oct <dig> target genes that summarizes further independent published experimental validations on the regulatory influence of oct <dig> to its presented target genes.

integration of data enriches functional content of oct <dig> target gene set
enrichment analysis  <cit>  revealed that the functional information content of the gene set is accelerated  by integrating the results of the individual studies. figure  <dig> shows the increase in the percentage of genes connected to gene ontology terms, for example "go:0003700: transcription factor activity", with respect to the original set of chip-on-chip targets , the re-analyzed set of chip-on-chip target genes , the additional filtering according to the rnai experiment  and additional motif mapping . the same trend can be observed with other go terms such as "go:0030154: cell differentiation", "go:0045165: cell fate commitment", "go:0009790: embryonic development", "go:0008283: cell proliferation", and others . table  <dig> shows the top enriched gene ontology terms .

oct <dig> core regulatory network
the resulting oct <dig> core regulatory network, also incorporating the information on direct target genes from the re-analyzed sox <dig>  and nanog  chip-on-chip experiments, is shown in figure  <dig>  the network distinguishes genes that are suppressed  from those that are activated  by oct <dig>  among the  <dig> genes a high fraction is annotated with transcription factor activity . furthermore, a classification in hescs specific genes  and genes that are associated with the process of differentiation  was performed by accessing several further public sources  <cit> . white boxed genes could not be annotated using these sources, but the information about up or down regulation after the oct <dig> knock-down indicates, whether the respective gene is functional connected to the process of differentiation or to the maintenance of pluripotency.

an additional level of gene regulation has been added to this core oct <dig> target network by further literature and database mining . this additional figure shows the core network extended by known up- and downstream target genes of the respective tfs as given by transfac  <cit>  and by another published work  <cit> .

further interactions of the oct <dig> target genes were revealed using the consensuspathdb  <cit> , a database that integrates the content of  <dig> different interaction databases with heterogeneous foci. as an example, additional file  <dig> shows known interaction partners of cdx <dig>  among these interactions, interestingly, a physical interaction is observed between cdx <dig> and pax <dig>  that is another important differentiation associated tf included in the presented set of oct <dig> target genes. the core oct <dig> network is represented in sbml format  which can be used for further studies, e.g, mathematical modelling.

de novo motif discovery
transcription factor co-localizations targeted by multiple transcription factors are sites that integrate the external signalling pathways to the transcriptional regulatory circuitry governed by oct <dig>  sox <dig>  and nanog and these sites may serve as focal points for the assembly of further regulatory nucleoprotein complexes  <cit> . in order to test for further regulatory co-factors of oct <dig>  we performed a de novo motif discovery analysis based on specific promoter regions of the  <dig> direct oct <dig> target genes derived from the re-analysis of the chip-on-chip data . the selected sub-sequences were repeat-masked  <cit>  and used as input for several de novo motif discovery algorithms . we identified  <dig> unique sequence motifs of higher quality . these motifs were compared against two existing databases of known motifs  using the stamp tool  <cit>  . motifs similar to the octamer and sox-oct joint motifs were discovered. additionally, sequence motifs were identified that are potentially recognized by factors involved in maintaining pluripotency and development. for the  <dig> core oct <dig> target genes, figure  <dig> lists the individual genes that contain the discovered motifs within their promoter regions.

interestingly, we identified a motif similar to the binding site of myc-max , a heterodimer of the transcription factors c-myc and max, a pre-requisite for c-myc transcriptional activity that leads to cell growth and proliferation  <cit> . c-myc has been utilized in a set of four transcription factors for deriving ips cells from somatic cells  <cit> . the c-myc related motif was identified in the promoter region of pip5k1c which encodes pipki gamma of the phophatidylinsitol pathway  <cit> . c-myc is even further connected to the presented oct <dig> regulatory network as it is a direct target of tcf <dig>  whose transcription is enhanced by oct <dig> function and which is a ctnnb <dig> binding protein that regulates wnt signalling, cell cycle, and cell proliferation  <cit> . moreover, c-myc is a direct target of e2f/dp, a complex essential for cell proliferation  <cit> . additionally, e2f/dp directly binds to orc1l , another member of the network which encodes for a chromatin binding protein that plays a role in dna replication initiation and mitotic cell cycle, induces caspase activation, cell surface exposure of phosphatidylserine, and dna fragmentation during apoptosis  <cit> . a motif similar to the binding site of e2f- <dig> was obtained by the de novo motif discovery. based on an analogous de novo motif discovery performed on the sub-sequences of validated peak regions taken from the promoter regions of the  <dig> core oct <dig> target genes only, a motif similar to the binding site of e2f was obtained  and could be mapped to the promoter regions of orc1l and further oct <dig> target genes .

discussion
we have performed an integrative study of complementary experimental techniques in order to identify the core gene regulatory network of oct <dig> in the context of maintaining pluripotency and preventing differentiation along the trophoblast lineage. this network represents a rather conservative selection since we have chosen only genes with high evidence that showed significant results in chip-on-chip analysis, rnai analysis and promoter sequence analysis.

although the presented network is rather conservative and potentially neglects genes regulated by oct <dig> together with unknown interaction partners, it represents the functional regulatory circuitry of direct oct <dig> target genes in hescs as deduced by the available data. it is a well-known problem of both chip-on-chip experiments and motif prediction analyses to generate a large number of false positives. additionally, rnai experiments do not only reveal direct but â€“ to a much higher extent â€“ indirect targets. thus, having a rather conservative process for identifying oct <dig> target genes has the benefit of narrowing down this large number of false positives. an indicator of this is the fact that the integration of the different experiments purifies and enriches functional content of the resulting targets in all investigated functional classes by factors of  <dig>  â€“  <dig> as is shown in figure  <dig> 

recent studies report oct4/oct <dig> expression in the adult, most frequently in the bone marrow of both humans and mice, particularly in hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells as well as in various sub-populations of multipotent progenitors  <cit> . it has been suggested that oct <dig> may not only be crucial for the maintenance of pluripotency in embryonic cells but may also play an important role for the self-renewal of somatic stem cells  <cit> . however, lengner et al.  <cit>  have shown that oct <dig>  even if expressed at low levels in somatic cells, is dispensable for the self-renewal of somatic stem cells, and for the regeneration of tissue in the adult, and is only rarely activated in somatic tumors. based on these observations, we do not consider oct4/oct <dig> to be a key player for transcriptional regulation of pluripotency in either mesenchymal stem cells and other adult stem cells. the identified core regulatory network of oct <dig> was created in the context of human embryonic stem cells for maintaining pluripotency and preventing differentiation along the trophoblast lineage.

our de novo motif discovery approach did not only reveal known oct <dig> binding sites but also motifs similar to binding sites recognized by regulators that are known to interact with components of the oct <dig> regulatory network as well as genes that may have important functions as downstream effectors of oct <dig> but not yet described. besides the co-factors presented above, a predominantly occurring motif is similar to a binding site recognized by sp <dig> , a transcription regulator that plays a role in tgf beta induced cell migration and mesenchymal transition, regulates angiogenesis, heart contraction, and aberrant expression is associated with several types of cancer. yang et al. proposed that sp <dig> or sp <dig> play a critical role in controlling the transcriptional activity of oct <dig> by direct binding and an overexpression study showed that sp <dig> positively regulates oct <dig> promoter activity  <cit> . the sp <dig> motif was identified within the promoter regions of oct <dig> and of other oct <dig> target genes . sp <dig> is closely connected to the network as it binds to fgf <dig>  c-myc, hoxb <dig>  spp <dig> , and interacts with egr- <dig>  moreover, sp <dig> interacts with cp2a, a tf which in turn regulates pax <dig>  <cit>  , a transcription factor which is a member of the differentiation related oct <dig> target genes. from the mouse model it is known that sp <dig> binds to foxa <dig> and cdx <dig>  egr- <dig>  is a transcription factor that acts in apoptosis, angiogenesis, cell differentiation, regulates tnf production, cell proliferation and adhesion and aberrant expression of the gene is associated with several types of cancer. hoxb <dig>  is a transcriptional activator and functions in dna double strand break repair by nonhomologous end joining. both, egr- <dig> and hoxb <dig> bind to the promoter region of fgf <dig> and a motif similar to the binding site of egr- <dig> was obtained .

as another example, the de novo motif discovery identified a binding site similar to a motif recognized by stat <dig> , a gene that mediates dna replication, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle regulation. it is known that stat <dig> binds to c-myc and is upregulated by sp <dig>  several of the oct <dig> target genes show a putative stat <dig> binding site within their promoter region .

hnf4a  has a known binding site similar to one of the obtained motifs. it is a transcription factor that inhibits gh <dig> induced stat <dig> and jak <dig> phosphorylation and functions in hepatocyte differentiation and blood coagulation. hnf4a expression is upregulated by sp <dig> and is a target of gata <dig>  a transcription factor which is a member of the differentiation related oct <dig> target genes. rab5a and tgif <dig> show a putative hnf4a binding site within their promoter region .

pax <dig>  is a putative rna polymerase ii transcription factor that acts in positive regulation of cell proliferation and motifs similar to the known binding site for pax <dig> were obtained. pax <dig> itself has a binding site for hnf4a which is a downstream target of gata <dig>  <cit> . there are putative pax <dig> binding sites within the promoter regions of several oct <dig> target genes .

the computed oct <dig> core regulatory network can be utilized in multiple ways. well-characterized oct <dig> target genes will help in extending the oct <dig> network by suggesting further experimental work. the relatively high proportion of tfs in the oct <dig> target set can be used for further inhibition studies or protein-dna binding experiments. this leads to an extended radius of the network. for example, additional file  <dig> shows that oct <dig> has a positive regulatory effect on fgf <dig>  fgf <dig> re-stimulation experiments performed by greber et al. in hescs revealed bmp <dig> as a downstream target of fgf <dig> signaling  <cit> . bmp <dig> expression was activated upon oct <dig> knockdown in the original experiment as well, so both experiments consistently confirm that bmp <dig> is a negatively regulated downtream target of oct <dig>  such an extended network and even the constructed core regulatory network will ultimately help in the study of stemness and early embryogenesis. figure  <dig> shows functional enrichment for "embryonic development" that is increasing from 8%â€“30% with the integrative approach.

finally, the identification of targets and co-factors of oct <dig> might help in the design of ips reprogramming protocols that use different tfs in order to generate and monitor cell status. c-myc has already been successfully applied within a set of tfs for generating ips cells through reprogramming. figure  <dig> gives a guided hint for testing a variety of these co-factors.

CONCLUSIONS
the oct <dig> dependent functional transcriptional regulatory network important in the analysis of human stem cell characteristics and cellular differentiation was reconstructed using an integrative approach. functional information is largely enriched using an overlay of different experimental results. the de novo motif discovery points out several well known regulators closely connected to the network as well as less described potential downstream regulators of pluripotency and differentiation.
