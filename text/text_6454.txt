BACKGROUND
the origin of the first photosynthetic organelle  is explained by primary endosymbiosis, whereby a non-photosynthetic protist engulfed and retained a cyanobacterium as a cytoplasmic organelle  <cit> . a variety of plastid-derived and some nuclear sequence data, as well as plastid-associated traits such as the composition and evolutionary history of the protein translocons  <cit> , and solute transporters embedded in the inner organelle membrane suggest that descendants of this 'primary' photosynthetic eukaryote were the ancestors of the putative supergroup plantae. the plantae is comprised of the red, green , and glaucophyte algae  <cit> . via eukaryote-eukaryote  endosymbiosis, photosynthesis and its associated genes spread thereafter into other eukaryotic groups . despite its importance to eukaryote evolution, our understanding of primary plastid origin remains limited because the endosymbiosis occurred >  <dig> billion years ago  <cit> . this dilemma has, however, a potential solution given the recently clarified evolutionary history of paulinella chromatophora. this little-known testate, filose amoeba  <cit> , which is a cercomonad species , contains two blue-green photosynthetic inclusions termed chromatophores  <cit> . there are no known fossils of paulinella, however, euglyphid-like testate amoebae have a long fossil history, occurring in sediments dated from  <dig> –  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . importantly, p. chromatophora is the only known case of an independent primary photosynthetic organelle acquisition , putatively recapitulating the process that gave rise to the plantae plastid  <cit> . this makes p. chromatophora an outstanding model for elucidating plastid acquisition and post-endosymbiotic genome evolution. two key reasons why it is believed the chromatophores  of p. chromatophora are bona fide organelles rather than temporary photosynthetic inclusions  are the apparent regulation of plastid division by the amoeba and the loss of 2/ <dig> of plastid coding potential through outright gene loss or transfer to the nucleus . paulinella plastid genome size is, however, far greater than the ca. 100– <dig> kb for typical plastid genomes from algae and plants suggesting it is likely a "work in progress" .

since its discovery by lauterborn  <cit> , four different paulinella species have been reported – the photoautotrophic p. chromatophora, which contains two plastids, is clearly separated from its three heterotrophic sister species that lack a plastid , although all share a typical oval-shaped cell morphology that consists of five rows of silicate scales . the phylogenetic relationship between these four paulinella species is unknown because of a lack of sequence data from heterotrophic paulinella species. however, it is obvious that p. chromatophora  and euglypha are closely related based on nuclear ssu rdna trees  <cit> . the derived position of p. chromatophora among the paulinellidae and the known ability of p. ovalis to ingest cyanobacteria  <cit>  make it a reasonable assumption that the primary plastid endosymbiosis occurred in p. chromatophora after its split from heterotrophic ancestors.

the minimum age of the endosymbiosis is postulated to be ca.  <dig> ma based on the mode and tempo of plastid genome reduction  <cit> . given these data, it is of high interest to isolate other photosynthetic paulinella strains/species to facilitate in-depth study of post-endosymbiotic genome evolution in distinct lineages that potentially share a common ancestral endosymbiont. paulinella chromatophora has been reported from around the world, including sites in switzerland  <cit> , the united kingdom  <cit> , and the united states  <cit> , however these were simple statements of occurrence without the deposition of voucher samples. this depauperate history of collection apparently reflects the rarity of p. chromatophora in nature and difficulties in its culture. therefore, all morphological and ultrastructural studies stem from samples collected in germany  <cit> . recent molecular phylogenetic and genomic studies also relied on strain m0880/a that was isolated in germany  <cit> . here, we isolated photosynthetic paulinella cells from several freshwater sites in japan and established a new strain in culture . we then conducted comparative morphological and molecular phylogenetic analysis of these taxa, focusing on the japanese fk <dig> and the german m0880/a strains.

RESULTS
morphology and ultrastructure of paulinella
morphological comparisons between paulinella fk <dig> and m0880/a strains were done using scanning electron microscopy . the general morphological characters we observed for m0880/a  are similar to the original description  <cit>  and a previous study  <cit> . the test is ovoid  and covered with silica scale plates. the anterior end has a narrow aperture  that is comprised of three oral scales  extending from the cell body as a "neck" . within this neck, two slightly curved oral scales abut each other between a membranous operculum with the third scale covering the edge of the two oral scales . below the oral scales, five descending columns of scales cover the test. a total of  <dig> –  <dig> scales are found in each column with the first row containing four scales instead of five . the scales around the anterior and posterior cell regions are smaller than in the middle. three or four rows of scales from the posterior end have dozens of pustules on the surface of each scale. the external surface of the rest of the body scales is smooth. the internal surface of the scales that are shown in fig. 1d  have  <dig> –  <dig> pores per scale which were reported as "sieve-plates" in a previous study  <cit> .

cells of strain fk <dig> are clearly distinguished from the original description of p. chromatophora . these paulinella cells are of a relatively smaller size  than in m0880/a  and there are between  <dig> –  <dig> scales per column. there are more distinctive, multiple fine pores on the external surface of scales in fk <dig> than in m0880/a . the fine-pored external surface was reported in newly formed scales in the heterotrophic species p. ovalis  <cit> . another heterotrophic species, p. indentata has a single row of fine-pores along the scale but three or four rows on the end of the scales  <cit> . there are five oral scales in the aperture , which is comprised of two main scales between a membranous operculum and three thinner scales that cover the main oral scales . the oral scales of fk <dig> are not projected outward to the same extent as in m0880/a , and the first row of body scales consists of five not four scales . pustules on the four rows of posterior scales  are more distinct than those in the m0880/a strain. the size of pustule-covered scales gradually increases from the centre to the outside in a counter-clockwise direction. around  <dig> –  <dig> internal "sieve-plate" pores are also found in fk <dig> and are detectable in sem images taken from outside the cell, particularly in the posterior region .

molecular phylogenetic analysis
given the obvious morphological differences described above, we used gene sequences to test the evolutionary relationship between the two strains. multiple markers were used for this purpose and we first present maximum likelihood  trees inferred from nuclear 18s rdna and a concatenated data set of plastid 16s + 23s rdna . given that filose amoebae such as p. chromatophora and euglypha are consistently recovered as members of the rhizaria , we chose to include only 18s rdna sequences from members of this putative supergroup  <cit> . the 18s rdna tree shows a monophyletic grouping of the two paulinella strains, suggesting they share a common photosynthetic 'host' ancestor. this hypothesis is substantiated by the plastid rdna tree , that shows a monophyletic grouping of m0880/a and fk <dig> as sister to synechococcus- and prochlorococcus-type cyanobacteria as previously described for m0880/a  <cit> . the 18s rdna tree provides high bootstrap and bayesian support  for a clade that unites both p. chromatophora strains with a group of uncultured marine environmental samples . because there are no sequence data available from heterotrophic paulinella species with a taxonomic identification, we could not provisionally identify the source of the environmental samples. however, given that all described photosynthetic p. chromatophora are derived from freshwater environments  <cit>  and the present work], these environmental sequences likely represent a marine sister group within the paulinellidae . the paulinellidae is closely related  to other euglyphids such as tracheoeuglypha, cyphoderia, and euglypha species.

trees inferred from actin and ftsz protein sequences are shown in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. the actin tree provides both bootstrap and bayesian support for the existence of a branch that unites m0880/a and fk <dig> , which in turn is sister to other euglyphid taxa  within the rhizaria. the overall topology for rhizaria actins  is consistent with previous analyses  <cit> . this monophyletic clade, although surrounded by many internal nodes that are only weakly supported, shows unequivocal sequence divergence between m0880/a and fk <dig>  pairwise analysis of synonymous  and non-synonymous  substitution rates between the paulinella actin coding regions are  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively . this ratio is comparable to actin sequence differences between two green algal ostreococcus species , two multicelluar liverworts , and different genera of yeasts . these results suggest that m0880/a and fk <dig> are significantly diverged from each other and likely constitute distinct species. this hypothesis is consistent with the plastid-derived gene data for rdna  and ftsz . interestingly, the estimated ks value between ftsz sequences from m0880/a and fk <dig> exceed the expected confidence limits  likely indicating these plastid-encoded genes are undergoing a high nucleotide substitution rate possibly as a result of the genome reduction process. taken together, our results indicate that after the single acquisition of the photosynthetic organelle, the p. chromatophora ancestor gave rise to at least two distinct lineages.

to advance our understanding of photosynthetic paulinella, we generated plastid-encoded 16s rdna sequences from environmental samples from four different sites in japan. we amplified the gene directly using a small number of cells that were manually isolated from materials collected at each site . the expanded rdna tree of photosynthetic paulinella  shows that all of the isolates cluster together with robust bootstrap and bayesian support  with a sister-group relationship to synechococcus/prochlorococcus, confirming the single origin of the plastid in these paulinella. the phylogeny also indicates that the paulinella isolates are split into two distinct clades. one clade includes the m0880/a strain that is closely related to isolates from kaga and kanazawa- <dig> and - <dig>  whereas the second includes the newly isolated fk01strain and a field isolate from lake kawaguchi . this topology is surprising because it does not provide evidence for geographic separation , but rather shows the german strain m0880/a might share a most recent common ancestor with japanese isolates . it is possible, however, that photosynthetic paulinella species are globally distributed and we simply lack data from other sites to demonstrate this result. in any case, our results suggest these fascinating organisms are unlikely to be a relict branch of filose amoebal evolution but may be broadly distributed with many more living taxa than previously thought. assessing further the biodiversity of this group and providing a taxonomic description of species are key next steps in understanding the biology of paulinella .

CONCLUSIONS
our results provide sufficient data to address the major aims of this study. the morphological and molecular data show that m0880/a and the newly isolated fk <dig> are distinct species , whereas phylogenetic analyses of these strains and other cells collected in nature demonstrate that all of the photosynthetic paulinella share a plastid derived from a single primary endosymbiosis. this is an important finding because the genus paulinella provides a set of diverged lineages that can be used to study the process of post-endosymbiotic plastid evolution using genomic and proteomic methods. one keystone process in this regard is endosymbiotic gene transfer , driven by a gene transfer ratchet  that relocates endosymbiont genes to the host nucleus. this is followed in some cases by endosymbiont gene activation and import of the encoded proteins into the plastid. how this occurs in related lineages and which genes are the primary targets for egt can now be explored in detail by studying the nuclear genome of different photosynthetic paulinella. nowack and colleagues  <cit>  reported that many cyanobacterial transporters were lost in the endosymbiont genome but the question remains whether they vanished or have been transferred to the nucleus for co-option in other host functions or retargeting to the organelle. a recent study by nakayama and ishida  <cit>  described for the first time a nuclear encoded photosynthetic gene in fk <dig> of cyanobacterial origin. the cdna encoding psae contains a putative polyadenylation signal  and a poly sequence at the 3' terminus, whereas the nuclear locus contains two putative spliceosomal introns. these data provide strong evidence for egt of the psae gene and we expect to find many more examples of this phenomenon when the nuclear genome of paulinella species is completed . in this regard, the current tree provides at least two distinct clades in which such questions about post-endosymbiotic egt can be studied using genomic methods. preliminary sequence data from the fk <dig> plastid genome, for example, show that it differs both with respect to gene content and gene order when compared to the published  <cit>  m0880/a genome .
