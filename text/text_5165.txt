BACKGROUND
developing methodologies for quantitative analysis, both experimental and mathematical, of complex biochemical networks has become one of the central themes of post-genomic biochemistry and mathematical biology. several disparate approaches, including metabolic control analysis   <cit> , flux balance analysis   <cit> , and correlation metric construction   <cit> , share many commonalities. the objective of this work is to provide a unifying mathematical framework and a thermodynamic basis for these approaches. the thermodynamic basis is the nonequilibrium steady-state  theory  <cit>  originally developed to describe macromolecular, free-energy transduction  <cit> , and the mathematical methods are based on linear analysis near a ness.

the physical concept of a ness  applies to that of a driven system, such as a living organism, with a constant flow of matter  through the system and a corresponding dissipation of free energy  <cit> . even though a ness looks remarkably similar to a thermodynamic equilibrium, in that chemical concentrations reach stationary values, the concentrations are maintained constant in a ness by balancing influxes and effuxes, rather than by balancing the forward and backward fluxes of each elementary reaction as in thermodynamic equilibrium. to an observer concerned only with the chemical concentrations, a ness would seem to be a true equilibrium; but, in fact, it represents a pseudo-equilibrium, where the work done to drive the system appears as heat, and deserves further consideration  <cit> .

we distinguish between two types of linear analysis:  linear stability analysis  <cit> , and  control analysis  that addresses how the steady-state shifts in response to certain perturbations to the system. these perturbations may be deterministic–leading to mca–or stochastic–leading to cmc. as expected, the matrix a obtained in linear stability analysis, the flux control-coefficient matrix c in mca, the stoichiometric matrix s of fba, and the correlation matrix r from cmc are intimately related. we develop the relationships in the context of complex biochemical networks and their ness thermodynamics. we show that all the key matrices in mca and cmc can be computed if one knows the fluxes, chemical potential differences, and the stoichiometric matrix.

the theoretical concept of a ness provides valuable mathematical and thermodynamic properties. although many of the approaches mentioned above have provided a mathematical treatment of ness, many have never explicitly taken the related thermodynamics into account. the key insight is to consider concentrations as measures of potentials, providing a relationship between potential differences , fluxes , and resistances. it becomes immediately clear that the resistances are related to reaction effectors, such as the expression levels of enzymes, that affect both the forward and backward fluxes of a given reaction, but do not change the chemical potential difference. it is this thermodynamic perspective of a ness that can be used to develop a comprehensive theory that unites these approaches.

in the context of the newly developed biochemical circuit theory   <cit> , the flux j of each metabolic reaction in a ness metabolic network is decomposed into j = φ+ - φ- and the chemical potential difference of the reaction in the ness is Δμ = kbt ln, where kb is boltzmann's constant and t is absolute temperature. therefore, knowing the chemical potential difference and the flux of a reaction gives

  φ+=j1−eΔμ/kbtandφ−=jeΔμ/kbt1−eΔμ/kbt. 

furthermore, if the standard-state free energy of reaction Δμo is known from equilibrium thermodynamics, then e/kbt determines the ratio of the metabolites' concentrations, products to reactants, in ness.

in many theoretical approaches, metabolic networks and signaling pathways are often separated into disparate mechanisms with only peripheral interactions. this is far from reality, however, as these mechanisms are intimately intertwined and often indistinguishable. for example, in whole-body metabolism, glucose and fatty acids serve as the fuel for cellular metabolism, but also as signals for insulin secretion in pancreatic β-cells and ketogenesis in hepatocytes, where cellular organelles, such as mitochondria, play a key role in the handshake between metabolism and signaling. ultimately, our goal is to understand how these cellular systems behave in response to stress and disease  <cit> . it is in applying the unified mathematical framework that includes the thermodynamic perspective to these processes that we believe the most significant contributions will be made.

in application, the concepts presented here allows one who has the stoichiometric matrix, s, and measures the correlation matrix, r, to obtain the control coefficients, and vice versa . furthermore, by incorporating the thermodynamic aspect, one is able to take full advantage of the thermodynamic properties, such as standard free energies of formation, which are typically more complete, more consistent, and more well analyzed than the kinetic information  <cit> . this is advantageous in a field where the availability of kinetic parameters is a limiting factor. however, available data remains incomplete, and missing thermodynamic and kinetic data must continually be obtained  <cit> .

basic kinetic equations for biochemical networks
let us consider a network of m biochemical reactions involving n biochemical species xi . the jth biochemical reaction  is characterized by a set of stoichiometric coefficients ν={νij} and κ={κij} such that

  ν1jx1+ν2jx2+⋯+νnjxn⇌k−jk+jκ1jx1+κ2jx2+⋯+κnjxn. 

some of the integer ν's and κ's can be zero. the n × m matrix s = κ - ν is known as the stoichiometric matrix. eq.  assumes that the forward and backward reaction kinetics are characterized by the constants k+j and k−j. in cases where the kinetic scheme involves intermediate steps , each of the intermediate steps can be incorporated as reactions in the form of eq. , requiring additional kinetic parameters, and the stoichiometric matrix can be constructed to include elementary reactions representing actual interaction events. segel  <cit> , for example, details how the michaelis-menten mechanism is expressed in terms of eq. .

for the reaction system , kinetic equations of the time-dependent concentration changes for each biochemical species can be written according to the law of mass action as  <cit> 

  dxidt=∑j=1m+jie, 

where we use xℓto denote the concentration of respective xℓ, and jie  are external injection fluxes to species i . we use the convention that subscripts index species and superscripts index reactions. to further simplify the notation, we introduce forward and backward fluxes jj=φ+j−φ−j <cit> :

 φ+j=k+jν1jν2j⋯νnj,φ−j=k−jκ−jκ2j⋯κnj. 

then eq.  becomes dx/dt = sj + je, in which x and je are n-dimensional column vectors, and j is an m-dimensional column vector.

in a closed reaction system, je =  <dig>  in this case, it can be shown that thermodynamic equilibrium is the only positive stationary solution to eq. : the internal fluxes j = φ+ - φ- =  <dig> for each and every reaction. for a closed biochemical reaction system, since all the fluxes are necessarily zero in its unique equilibrium , all the control coefficients are necessarily zero. therefore, in a ness, at least one injection flux and one effux are nonzero , or certain concentrations xi are held at constant levels. the former case is referred to as "external flux injection," while the latter is referred to as "external concentration clamping." a distinction between these two "forcing" mechanisms greatly clarifies many controversial issues concerning ness.

steady-state concentrations
in the equilibrium state of a closed reaction system, φ+ = φ- and the ratio of chemical concentrations is independent of the amount of material and the initial condition:

 κ−jκ2j⋯κnjν1jν2j⋯νnj=k+jk−j, 

giving rise to the concept of chemical equilibrium constants. such a system of biochemical reactions is non-dissipative and is associated with a number of conserved quantities. an essential mathematical characteristic of the closed system is that its equilibrium point is degenerate , i.e., there is no unique stationary solution for different initial conditions.

for an open system that approaches a ness, the stationary solution is not usually degenerate. if we assume {xi∗} is an asymptotically stable ness, small differences in the initial condition should lead to the same ness. we use the notations s to denote the set of concentrations of internal species and i to denote the concentrations of external species which are clamped or independently varied.

in the linear regime near the ness  <cit> ,

  ddt=∑j=1naijxj∗, 

in which δxj = xj - xj∗ and

 aij=∑ℓ=1m. 

a = {aij} is called the linear stability matrix. we introduce the n × m matrix r = {rij=νijφ+j−κijφ−j}, such that a = srt. we also denote a- <dig> = b.

if the nonlinear dynamics scheme of eq.  conserves certain quantities, such as total element, motif, or enzyme concentrations, s does not have full rank and a is singular  <cit> . in such cases, it is possible to transform a into a nonsingular matrix by replacing its linearly dependent rows with vectors in its left null space . by doing so, one removes the redundancies from the original dynamics scheme. a more detailed mathematical analysis will be published elsewhere. both here and below, a is understood to be the transformed nonsingular matrix.

RESULTS
metabolic control analysis
eq.  is a general scheme for biochemical reaction networks. for metabolic reactions involving enzymes, the enzyme and the enzyme-substrate complexes are treated as additional "species." in this section, however, we study mca, and assume that every reaction involves an enzyme which is not explicitly expressed as a species. rather, we assume enzyme activity is absorbed into the rate constants for the forward and backward reactions. this is clearly not an accurate approximation for many enzymatic reaction mechanisms. nevertheless, it provides a first-order approximation for treating a metabolic network. more complex rate laws for enzymatic reactions have been discussed for biochemical systems analysis  <cit> .

mca focuses on how the ness {xi∗} shifts in response to a perturbation to the amount of enzyme for a reaction or a perturbation to its substrate  concentration. without losing generality, we assume these perturbations are made to the enzyme for the mth reaction or the nth  species.

elasticity coefficients
first, we consider the case where the concentration of external species n is changed: xn∗→xn∗+δxn. before reaching a new ness, the local response is only in the flux of the reactions involving xn. the immediate, local change is characterized by

  εnm≜xn∗jm=νnmφ+m−κnmφ−mφ+m−φ−m=rnmjm 

which is called the scaled, local elasticity-coefficient  <cit> . these coefficients are elements of the scaled, local, elasticity-coefficient matrix, ε = - <dig> rt. here, we use the same notation used by heinrich and schuster  <cit> , where  denotes the diagonal matrix containing the components of the vector v along its diagonal. the unscaled, local, elasticity-coefficient matrix is given by ε' =  ε - <dig> = rt - <dig>  the prime symbol is used to distinguish unscaled coefficients from scaled coefficients, both here and in what is to follow.

the coefficient ε should be set apart from the coefficient ε, which characterizes the steady-state response  <cit> . when a new ness is established, the concentrations {xi}  satisfy

  ∑j=1n−1aijδxjxj∗=−ainδxnxn∗. 

solving eq. , we have δxi/xi∗=binδxn/bnnxn∗ where bin is the nth column vector of the matrix a- <dig>  the new ness established near {xi∗} is {xi∗+δxi}, and the new fluxes, jm + δjm, are given by

  δjm=δφ+m−δφ−m=∑ℓ=1nδxℓxℓ∗=∑ℓ=1nbℓnδxnbnnxn∗. 

hence, the scaled, steady-state elasticity-coefficient is  <cit> 

  εnm≜xn∗jm=∑ℓ=1nbℓnbnn, 

which may also be known as a response coefficient  <cit> . these coefficients are elements of the scaled, steady-state, elasticity-coefficient matrix, ε = - <dig> rtb - <dig>  here,  denotes the diagonal matrix containing only the diagonal components of the matrix b along its diagonal. the unscaled, steady-state, elasticity-coefficient matrix is given by ε' =  ε - <dig> = rtb - <dig> - <dig> 

as we shall show, some connectivity theorems for the two quantities ε and ε are different. in principle, the ε can be experimentally measured as a system response, but obtaining ε can be more difficult since it is a transient response that must be measured individually.

control coefficients
next, we consider the case where the enzyme for the mth reaction em is changed: em → em + δem. since we have assumed that the rate constants for reaction m, k±m, are linearly proportional to the concentration of the enzyme catalyzing reaction m, em, we have

 emk+m=emk−m= <dig>  

when em → em + δem, the new ness satisfies  <cit> 

  ∑j1naijδxjxj∗=δemem. 

solving for δxj/xj∗ , we have

  δxjxj∗∑j=1nbji=δemem. 

from eq. , we get the scaled, concentration control-coefficient  <cit> ,

  c^mm≜emxj∗=−∑j=1nbji=, 

which is an element of the scaled, concentration, control-coefficient matrix given by c^ = -bs. the unscaled, concentration, control-coefficient matrix is c^′ =  c^ - <dig> = -bs.

combining eqs.  and , we get the scaled, flux control-coefficient  <cit> ,

  cjm≜emjm=δmm−∑ℓ=1n∑i=1nbℓi, 

where δmm is the kronecker delta function. these coefficients are elements of the scaled, flux, control-coefficient matrix given by c = i - - <dig> rtbs . the unscaled, flux, control-coefficient matrix is c' =  c - <dig> = i - rtbs.

summation and connectivity theorems
among ε, ε, c, and c^, we have the following relationships. first, note the relationships

  c^=−ε)−1 s, 

  c=i+εc^, 

between the scaled coefficients, and similarly,

  c^′=−−1s, 

  c′=i+ε′c^′, 

between the unscaled coefficients.

second, from eqs. –, it is straightforward to show that if there is no injection flux, i.e., in ness sj = -je =  <dig>  we have

  c^1m×1=0n× <dig>  

  c1m ×  <dig> = 1m ×  <dig>  

where 1i × j and 0i × j denote the i × j matrices of ones and zeros, respectively. eqs.  and  are known as the summation theorems for the scaled control-coefficients. for the unscaled control-coefficients, we have the generalized summation theorems, c'k = k and c^′k=0n×, where k is the m ×  loop  matrix, i.e., its columns form a basis of the nullspace of s so that sk = 0n ×   <cit> .

euler's theorem on homogeneous functions can be used to understand the significance of the injection fluxes  <cit> . if there are no injection fluxes and a ness is sustained by clamped concentrations, the steady-state fluxes are homogeneous functions of the enzyme concentrations with order  <dig>  that is to say that, assuming every reaction in the system is catalyzed by an enzyme, if every enzyme concentration is simultaneously doubled, the flux in each reaction doubles. this leads to the summation theorem for the flux control-coefficients. on the other hand, if there are no clamped concentrations and a ness is sustained by injection fluxes, the steady-state fluxes are homogeneous functions of enzyme concentrations with order  <dig>  a similar argument exists for steady-state concentrations as a function of enzyme concentrations, leading to the summation theorem for the concentration control-coefficients.

third, bsrt = i ⇒  = rtb, which yields the connectivity theorems for the scaled coefficients:

  c^ε=−i,c^ε=−b− <dig>  

  cε = 0m × n,   cε = 0m × n, 

and the generalized connectivity theorems for the unscaled coefficients  <cit> :

  c^′ε′=−i,c^′ε′=− b−1− <dig>  

  c'ε' = 0m × n,   c'ε' = 0m × n. 

finally, by combining the generalized summation and connectivity theorems, we get

  =−in×n), 

which is the central equation in mca  <cit> . the matrix  has been proved to be invertible  <cit> . therefore, if the local elasticity-coefficients are known, the control-coefficients can be calculated.

using the steady-state elasticity-coefficients, we have

  =− b−1−1). 

the matrix  is also invertible . therefore, if the steady-state elasticity-coefficients are known, the control-coefficients can be calculated. this is an important result because ε can be experimentally measured as a system response, but obtaining ε can be more difficult since it is a transient response and must be measured individually.

biochemical potential and its control analysis
the most notable difference between bct and other theories of biochemical networks is its sound thermodynamics basis  <cit> . bct articulates the fluxes j and chemical potential differences Δμ as two, complementary, key characteristics of a reaction in a ness. kirchhoff's flux and potential laws are manifestations of the fundamental laws of physical chemistry, namely conservation of mass and conservation of energy  <cit> .

both j and Δμ can be written in terms of the forward and backward fluxes φ+ and φ- as given in eq. , and vice versa. in general, the flux j and the chemical potential difference Δμ are nonlinearly related  <cit> :

  j=φ+=φ−. 

in the linear regime with small flux and chemical potential difference, j and Δμ are linearly related with the biochemical conductance being φ+/kbt   <cit> . in the nonlinear regime, if a perturbation on a reaction is from its upstream, we can assume the φ- is relatively unperturbed. then we have δj/δΔμ = -φ+/kbt. similarly, if the reaction is perturbed from its downstream, then δj/δΔμ = -φ-/kbt.

combining bct and mca, we can define the scaled, local elasticity-coefficients for chemical potentials  <cit> 

  nm≜xn∗Δμm=kbtΔμm 

as elements of the matrix εΔμ = kbt - <dig> st, the scaled, steady-state elasticity-coefficients for chemical potentials

  nm≜xn∗Δμm=kbt∑ℓ=1nbℓnΔμmbnn 

as elements of the matrix εΔμ = kbt - <dig> stb - <dig>  and the scaled, potential control-coefficients  <cit> 

  nm≜enΔμm=−kbt∑ℓ=1n∑i=1nbℓiΔμm 

as elements of the matrix cΔμ = -kbt - <dig> stbs , where reaction potentials and substrate concentrations in the reference state are used for normalization. the corresponding unscaled coefficients are given in matrix form as

 ' =  εΔμ - <dig> = kbtst - <dig>  

 ' =  εΔμ - <dig> = kbtstb - <dig> - <dig>  

 ' =  cΔμ - <dig> = -kbtstbs. 

note the appearance of the matrices st, stb, and stbs in the local and steady-state elasticity-coefficients and the control-coefficient for the potentials, as compared to the matricies rt, rtb, and rtbs in the coefficients for the fluxes. furthermore, note the relationships

  c^{Δμ=εΔμc^, 

  ′=′c^′. 

eqs.  and  in combination yield the summation  <cit>  and connectivity theorems for the scaled coefficients, under consideration of the steady-state condition,

  cΔμ1m ×  <dig> = 0m ×  <dig>  

  cΔμε = -εΔμ,   cΔμε = -εΔμ. 

eq.  can also be derived using the homogeneous function theory . for the unscaled coefficients, we get the generalized summation and connectivity theorems by combining eqs.  and  so that

  ' k = 0m × , 

  ' ε' = -',   ' ε' = -'. 

eq.  is a manifestation of kirchhoff's loop law  <cit> .

by combining the generalized summation and connectivity theorems, we get

  ′c^′)=−′0n×−i). 

the matrix  has been proved to be invertible  <cit> . therefore, if the local elasticity-coefficients are known, the control-coefficients can be calculated. using the steady-state elasticity-coefficients, we have

  ′c^′)=−′0n×− b−1−1). 

the matrix  has an inverse . therefore, if the steady-state elasticity-coefficients are known, the control-coefficients can be calculated.

correlation metric construction
correlation metric construction  focuses on how the ness {xi∗} fluctuates in response to a random stochastic perturbation to the concentration level of an external species xn ∈ i. we assume the perturbation is small. hence, the linear analysis is appropriate.

if the random perturbation has a sufficiently long correlation time compared to the relaxations of all the reactions in the system, then we are dealing with a shift in the ness where, according to eq. ,

 δxi/xi∗=binδxn/bnnxn∗. 

from the time series of {δxi} with an uncorrelated perturbation on δxn, we have

  〈δxiδxj〉〈2〉〈2〉= <dig> 

for i, j =  <dig>   <dig>  ..., n.

cmc extracts information from reaction systems by using perturbations with insufficiently long correlation times. δxn is a markov process characterized by

  ddt=−kdδxn+aξ, 

where kd controls the relaxation time of the perturbation, a is its random amplitude with gaussian distribution, and ξ is a uncorrelated noise. δxn in eq.  is called an ornstein-uhlenbeck  process with auto-covariance function

  g≜〈δxnδxn〉=a22kde−kd|τ|. 

with this type of random perturbation, the temporal correlations between the concentration fluctuations give information on the connectivity of a network following the kinetic equation 

  ddt=∑j=1n−1δxj+ainxn∗δxn 

for i =  <dig>   <dig>  ...,. more precisely , instead of eq.  cmc follows an autoregressive  process, the discrete version of an ou process, with discrete time t, 2t, ...,

 δxi=∑i=1nijδxj−binaξn, 

in which a˜˜ij=aij/xj∗−δinkd. the discrete ar and continuous ou models give essentially the same result.

let's rewrite the a matrix into a  ×  matrix a˜={a˜ij=aij/xj∗,i,j= <dig> ,...,n−1}. then the stationary solution to eqs.  and  is

  δxi=∑ℓ=1n−1∫0t)iℓaℓnxn∗δxndη, 

which leads to

  〈δxiδxj〉=∑ℓ,m=1n−1∫0∞∫0∞iℓaℓnamnxn∗xn∗jmgdηdζ. 

two limits of eq.  are particularly interesting. if the correlation time of g in eq.  is ≫ all the relaxation times of a˜, then we have eq. . on the other hand, if the correlation time for the random perturbation is ≪ all the relaxation times of a˜, we have

  〈δxiδxj〉=∑ℓ=1n−1〈δxiδxℓ〉jℓ. 

the matrix r=ea˜t is the fundamental solution to the linear kinetic equation . rij is the response curve, as a function of t, for the ith species to an impulse of the jth species at time  <dig>  the relation between the correlation matrix and the fundamental solution is expected for a linear system. for directly connected species i and j, the r′ij≠ <dig>  whereas if i and j are not directly connected, r′ij= <dig>  analytic solutions for completely linear systems have been derived and analyzed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
rate limiting step: largest flux control-coefficient and smallest biochemical conductance
both flux control-coefficients and biochemical conductances can be used as indicators for rate-limiting steps in a biochemical network  <cit> . traditionally the rate-limiting step is understood in terms of the highest "activation barrier" in the pathway. here we use a simple example to demonstrate that these concepts are intimately related. mathematically, the highest activation barrier is also related to the mean first-passage time in stochastic dynamics  <cit> .

let's consider the linear pathway

  x0⇌k−1k1x1⇌k−2k2x2⇌k−3k3⋯⇌xn−2⇌k−kn−1xn−1⇌k−nkn−1xn 

under ness with clamped concentrations x <dig> and xn for x <dig> and xn, respectively. analogous to a continuous energy landscape, we have the discrete energy function

 ej=−kbtln⁡, 

for j =  <dig>   <dig> ..., n. if there is a rate-limiting step, say for example that reaction j is nearly irreversible, then ej is maximal and that is where the highest energy barrier is located. we now show that it is also where the largest flux control-coefficient and the smallest conductance are.

the ness flux of reaction system  can be solved for analytically to yield  <cit> 

  j=k1k2⋯knk−1k−2⋯k−nx0−xn1k−n+knk−nk−+knkn−1k−nk−k−+⋯+knkn−1⋯k2k−nk−⋯k− <dig>  

therefore, the flux control-coefficient is

  cℓj=eℓj=knkn−1⋯kℓ+1k−nk−n⋯k−k−ℓ1k−n+knk−nk−+knkn−1k−nk−k−+⋯+knkn−1⋯k2k−nk−⋯k− <dig>  

which reaches its maximum at maximal ej. the biochemical conductance, on the other hand, is

 |jΔμℓ|=jkbt−1=jkbj− <dig>  

which is at its minimum when φ+ℓ  reaches its minimum. for small flux, φ+ℓ  reaches its minimum also at maximal ej where concentration xℓis the lowest.

note that with j given, the smallest conductance also corresponds to the largest |Δμ|. in general, the rate-limiting step is not necessarily where the k's are smallest. the most efficient situation for reaction system  is when all the conductances are equal. this result is analogous to the constant torque principle suggested for molecular motors  <cit> .

flux-controlled and concentration-controlled biochemical networks
the analysis provided in the present paper poses the following biological question. when is a ness of a biochemical network controlled by a constant flux injection and when is it controlled by a clamped concentration ? clearly in real biological systems, the appropriate answer is a combination of both. just as a real battery, having both finite internal resistance and conductance, in an electrical circuit is a combination of constant-current  and constant-voltage  ideal batteries, so too would a real biological system be a combination of constant flux injections and clamped concentrations  <cit> . nevertheless, a brief discussion on this topic provides insights into the control of biochemical networks.

first, let's see what are the respective consequences of these two different types of "forcing" to a biochemical system. for a constant flux injection j to a simple unimolecular reaction in a ness, we have the heat dissipation rate 

  hdr=−jΔμ=kbtjln⁡. 

this indicates that for the same injection flux j a reaction with larger φ-  dissipates a smaller amount of heat. for a constant clamped chemical potential Δμ, we have

  hdr=Δμφ−. 

we note that hdr increases with φ- for the constant potential difference  case. these results are analogous to an electric circuit in which the heat dissipation equals i2r and u2/r, respectively.

this observation leads us to the following hypothesis. in a biochemical network for biosynthesis, the fluxes are essential for supply and demand. hence, such networks will in general have large conductances in order to minimize the energy waste and be efficient. on the other hand, in a biochemical network for cellular signaling, the concentrations are the essential signal. thus, in this case the conductances are generally small in order to minimize the energy waste.

relation to the biochemical systems analysis
mca shares an intimate relationship with the biochemical systems analysis  originally proposed by m.a. savageau  <cit> . a critique of bsa can be found in  <cit> . bsa assumes that each metabolic reaction is catalyzed by an enzyme with rapid pseudo-steady-state enzyme-substrate complexes. this assumption leads to an explicit mathematical expression for the flux j in the enzymatic reaction as a rational function of the concentration of a substrate x  <cit> , such that

  j=α0⋯β0⋯, 

where k ≤ l due to substrate saturation or effector inhibition. the coefficients ai, bi, α <dig>  and β <dig> contain the concentrations of all the other substrates. bsa provides insight to the properties of ai and bj. the network of metabolic reactions is then modeled  <cit>  by a system of enzymatic reactions with a rate law given in the form of .

in terms of eq.  the local elasticity-coefficient for the flux j can be written as

  ε=xx+a1+xx+a2+⋯+xx+ak−xx+b1−xx+b2−⋯−xx+bl, 

which also has the standard form of a pade approximation  <cit> . furthermore, bsa proposed  <cit>  to approximate  by a power-law expression

  j≈cx1ε1x2ε2⋯xnεn, 

which is essentially the integral form of the definition of local elasticity-coefficients.

in contrast, mca assumes no specific rate laws for an enzymatic reaction except that the rate is linearly proportional to the enzyme concentration. this assumption is certainly valid for most biochemical reactions except when a substrate concentration is significantly less than that of an enzyme.
