BACKGROUND
freshwater acidification is an important stressor that affects the structure of zooplankton communities in lake ecosystems. acidification may arise from natural processes such as spring acid episodes  <cit> , acid rock drainage  <cit>  and volcanism  <cit> , or from anthropogenic activities including fossil fuels burning  <cit> , agriculture measures  <cit> , dredging of waterways  <cit>  and mining-related processes   <cit> . ph levels below 5– <dig> generally decrease the zooplankton species richness compared to circumneutral ph conditions  <cit> . among the zooplankton, crustaceans of the genus daphnia are usually less abundant in acidified lakes while other  cladocerans, calanoid copepods, and insects  may increase in importance or even become dominating  <cit> . the mechanisms behind these changes in the zooplankton community structure are manifold. they include a differential physiological sensitivity to acid stress  <cit> , a differential tolerance against toxic metal species  <cit> , which become more soluble under acidic conditions, as well as altered biotic interactions arising from the effect of ph on phytoplankton and planktivore communities  <cit> .

it is well-known that the physiological sensitivity of aquatic animals to acidic conditions is associated with iono- and osmoregulatory processes  <cit> . faced with the continuous diffusive gain of water and loss of ions, freshwater animals generally have to minimize their whole-body permeability to water and/or ions and additionally require compensatory uptake mechanisms for sodium and chloride to maintain a steady-state ion balance  <cit> . while data on whole-body water permeability of freshwater zooplankton are essentially lacking  <cit> , there is some information on sodium permeability. in general, acid-tolerant species such as aquatic insects have a relatively low sodium permeability in comparison to cladocerans  <cit> . in the acid-sensitive daphnids, the inability to survive long term below ph  <dig> is correlated with the net loss of body sodium due to an accelerated rate of na+ loss and a reduced rate of na+ uptake  <cit> , a process that is additionally influenced by the ambient calcium concentration  <cit> .

the acidification-induced impairment of sodium uptake in daphnids suggests that the transport of sodium across the epipodites – the so-called 'branchial sacs'  <cit>  – is linked with proton extrusion  <cit> , as it is in the gills of other freshwater animals such as fish and crayfish  <cit> . the protons arise from the catalyzed hydration of co <dig> by a cytoplasmic carbonic anhydrase in the ionoregulatory epithelia. this reaction produces  which is then excreted in exchange for chloride  <cit> . the interdependence between ionoregulatory processes, acid-base balance, and co <dig> transport explains the strong impact of acid stress on the physiology of many freshwater animals. however, in contrast to the detailed information on teleost fish  <cit>  and crayfish  <cit> , the physiological implications of acid stress in daphnids have remained largely unexplored. daphnids are important model organisms in ecotoxicology, and there is a growing interest in establishing mechanistic links between molecular stress responses and organismal stress responses  <cit> . understanding the specific physiology of daphnia may help to elucidate the modes of action of environmental toxicants  <cit> .

the present study provides the experimental, methodical, and conceptual framework to analyze the acid-stress physiology of daphnids. preliminary tests with daphnia pulex yielded the appropriate acclimation conditions which guaranteed the survival, growth, and reproduction under acidic  and circumneutral conditions . based on these stable laboratory populations, we determined the buffer characteristics from microliter hemolymph samples, analyzed the extracellular acid-base state by microspectralfluorometry using the ph-sensitive dye csnarf- <dig>  and studied the responses to a short-term exposure to severe acid stress . circulation, ventilation and respiration were additionally analyzed and served as diagnostic indicators for the interpretation of acid-base disturbances. moreover, reproduction was monitored to assess acidification-induced changes in maintenance costs and energy-and-mass budget. finally, the implications of the presence or absence of an extracellular carbonic anhydrase for acid-base balance and circulatory co <dig> transport are discussed.

RESULTS
acid-base balance under normal conditions
a rather alkaline extracellular ph of  <dig>  ±  <dig>   was measured in the heart region of animals which were raised and examined under normal conditions . by taking the characteristics and the variability of the hemolymph buffer curves  into account, the mean in vivo ph corresponded to an equilibrium pco <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kpa  and a hemolymph bicarbonate concentration of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm . the derived pco <dig> value is a representative measure of the extracellular pco <dig> in the heart reagion as long as the co2+h2o↔h++ reaction in the hemolymph can reasonably be assumed to be in equilibrium. the information on the hemolymph buffer curves and the extracellular ph was used to assess the capacity of the extracellular compartment to buffer hydrogen ions of metabolic origin. the hemolymph had a total buffer value  of  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ph- <dig> . bicarbonate covered 93% of βt, and the non-bicarbonate buffer value  was  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ph- <dig> 

buffer curves were obtained by measuring the ph of hemolymph samples in dependence on co <dig> partial pressure . the three buffer curves of each acclimation group were simultaneously fitted by the binary buffer model , using pk'a as a shared parameter. this means that the value of this parameter was forced to be the same for all three buffer curves. given are the best-fit parameter values  for the strong ion difference , the concentration  and pk'a value of the non-bicarbonate buffer, and the the standard error of the fit . the number for the degrees of freedom  was  <dig>  the reverse determination of pco <dig> from ph is exemplified as follows. given the in vivo ph of  <dig> , the three calibration buffer curves of the ph  <dig>  acclimation group yielded pco <dig> values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kpa,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kpa, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kpa. these individual means were finally averaged to yield an overall mean of  <dig>  kpa with a standard error of  <dig>  kpa. this standard error therefore reflects the variability among the buffer curves.

given the extracellular ph of  <dig> , which is markedly higher than the circumneutral values of other water-breathing crustaceans   <cit> , one is tempted to assume that daphnia pulex is in a state of permanent respiratory alkalosis. indeed, the filter-feeding mode of life of daphnids is inevitably associated with high ventilation rates   <cit> , which should favor the wash-out of carbon dioxide from the hemolymph. however, the present study gave no indication for a respiratory hypocapnia in d. pulex, since the extracellular ph suggested an equilibrium pco <dig> of  <dig>  kpa, which is higher than the typical pco <dig> values  in the prebranchial and postbranchial hemolymph of other water-breathing crustaceans. if the equilibrium pco <dig> in the postbranchial hemolymph of d. pulex would approach the low value of, say,  <dig>  kpa, an extreme alkalosis  would occur. taking the scaling relationship between metabolic rate and body size into account  <cit> , the exceptional acid-base state of these small crustaceans seems to be determined by two main factors:  a high, specific metabolic rate, which contributes to the elevated pco <dig> levels, and  a high bicarbonate buffer value, which might be a pre-adaptive feature to cope with a highly variable, physiologically challenging environment.

one may argue that the in vivo results are to some extent influenced by the experimental procedures, which required the microinjection of a ph-sensitive dye into the circulatory system of immobilized animals. previous studies  <cit>  have shown that the immobilization does not induce any noticable physiological disturbances, provided that the animals have the chance to acclimate to the experimental conditions for at least  <dig> min. immobilized animals of d. magna, for example, exhibit the typical resting values in heart rate  and appendage beating rate  and respond in a predictable manner to changes in abiotic  <cit>  and biotic factors  <cit> . the microinjection procecure, however, is known to induce a bradycardia in d. magna  <cit>  and it did so in d. pulex. our microinjected control animals  had a fh of  <dig> ±  <dig> min- <dig> , which was significantly lower than that of non-injected animals . in contrast, there was no significant effect on fa . the slower fh was very likely caused by the increase in hemolymph viscosity due to the injection of the dye-coupled 70-kda dextrans. given the 34% reduction in fh, one may suppose a pertubation in the hemolymph partial pressures of respiratory gases including the pco <dig>  theoretical analyses in terms of the co <dig> transport model, which is described below, revealed that the mean extracellular pco <dig> would be 8% smaller in the absence of a bradycardia. an effect of this magnitude does not invalidate the findings about the exceptional acid-base state of d. pulex.

physiological and visible effects of chronic exposure to acidic conditions
animals raised and tested under acidic conditions  had extracellular ph values of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  , respectively. these values were  <dig> – <dig>  ph units lower than that of the control  animals. the differences in extracellular ph among the acclimation groups were statistically significant . the extracellular pco <dig>  of the ph  <dig>  acclimated animals was virtually the same as that of the control group. in contrast, ph  <dig>  animals had a significantly lower extracellular pco <dig> of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  kpa .

the slight acidosis in the extracellular fluid was associated with a significant  reduction in hemolymph bicarbonate concentration to  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm in ph  <dig>  animals and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm in ph  <dig>  animals . reductions of similar relative magnitude have been observed in freshwater crayfish  <cit> . this depletion in hemolymph bicarbonate, by the entry of acidic equivalents from the ambient medium , caused a proportional reduction in the bicarbonate buffer value . the ph  <dig>  animals partly compensated the 30% reduction in βb by increasing the non-bicarbonate buffer value  from  <dig>  to  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ph- <dig>  while ph  <dig>  animals experienced a 65% loss in βb . although the compensatory increase in βa was almost negligible, the ph  <dig>  animals still had significant reserves in βa which are available in the case of a progressive acidosis .

heart rate , ventilation rate , and oxygen consumption rate () were additionally monitored as diagnostic indicators for the mechanistic interpretation of acid-base disturbances. compared to the control group, animals raised and tested under ph  <dig>  showed a 20% higher fh, a 14% higher fa and a 38% higher  , supposedly to meet the increased maintenance requirements for ion regulation. these systemic adjustments had no influence on extracellular pco <dig>  the acidosis of the ph  <dig>  animals  was therefore of metabolic rather than of respiratory origin. in agreement with the convention in acid-stress physiology  <cit> , the term 'metabolic acidosis' is used here irrespective of whether the protons originate endogenously in connection with lactic acid production or exogenously, by the influx of h+ down the large medium-to-hemolymph h+ gradient. the metabolic acidosis was very likely caused by an influx of acidic equivalents from the ambient medium, since the sustained circulation and ventilation argue against the possibility of an activation of anaerobic support mechanisms.

compared to the control group, the ph  <dig>  animals experienced a  <dig> -unit decrease in extracellular ph , which can be characterized as metabolic acidosis with respiratory compensation as indicated by the reduced extracellular pco <dig>  since the oxygen consumption rate  did not change significantly in comparison to the control animals , the main reasons for the reduced extracellular pco <dig> are the 34–46% increased ventilation and perfusion rates  as well as an enhanced permeability of the integument for respiratory gases, probably due to a thinner carapace. the latter explanation is consistent with the observation of the softer carapaces, which occurred only in the ph  <dig>  animals. as in acid-stressed freshwater crayfish  <cit> , the softer  carapace of ph  <dig>  animals may indicate a poor calcification resulting from exoskeletal caco <dig> erosion and reduced calcium and basic equivalent () uptake during the postmoult stage.

one may wonder why the acidification-induced increase in  was only present in the ph  <dig>  animals but absent in the ph  <dig>  animals. the  is expressed here as specific rate , which is normalized to cubic body length rather than to body weight. it is common practice to estimate the body weight of daphnids from body length using scaling relationships . however, we discarded this estimation because of the uncertainty about the influence of acidification on the relationship between body length and body weight. in the ph  <dig>  animals, a reduction in the amount of metabolically active biomass  could have masked the supposed extra costs for ion regulation. evidence for this explanation comes from the comparison of brood sizes of those animals which were analyzed in the respiration experiment. the egg numbers of ph  <dig>  animals  were significantly lower than those of the ph  <dig>  animals  and ph  <dig>  animals  . all eggs were of early developmental stage and accounted for very little respiration in the brooding females  <cit> . nevertheless, the reduced allocation of resources into reproduction implies an acidification-induced disturbance in the energy and mass budgets of the ph  <dig>  animals. indeed, these animals showed the highest degree of transparency owing to the decreased appearance of orange-colored fat cells. fat cells store carbohydrates and lipids  <cit> , the latter in form of droplets which are usually colored, owing to the presence of carotinoids  <cit> . in addition, fat cells produce hemoglobin  <cit>  and are supposed to be involved in vitellogenin synthesis  <cit> . whether the acidification-induced disturbance in the energy and mass budgets results solely from the increased maintenance costs for ion homeostasis or, additionally, from a reduced assimilation rate  needs further investigation.

it is important to note that no diapausing eggs occurred in ph  <dig>  animals during the six-month experimental period. obviously, the physiologically demanding condition of ph  <dig>  was either not associated with an activation of the stress-signaling cascade responsible for production of male offspring  <cit>  or males did not survive until maturity. the ph  <dig>  animals, in contrast, were distinguished by the repeated occurrence of parthenogenic eggs with a white cover layer which probably resulted from a fungal infection. although there are some reports on increased fungal parasitism in daphnids  <cit>  and crayfish  <cit>  under various stress conditions, it remains to be clarified whether acid stress leads to an increased susceptibility of daphnids to fungal parasites  <cit> .

the role of acclimation in the tolerance to severe acid stress
the tolerance to a short-term exposure to severe acid stress  was examined in the control and acid-acclimated animals. the animals were initially exposed to their respective acclimation ph before the ambient ph was set to ph  <dig>  and then to ph  <dig>  . upon exposure to ambient ph  <dig> , all groups experienced an acidosis, but were able to stabilize their extracellular ph at a level  <dig> – <dig>  ph units below the respective pre-exposure value . this response was caused by a 'metabolic acid load' of  <dig>  meq l- <dig> ,  <dig>  meq l- <dig> , and  <dig>  meq l- <dig> . while the fh remained unaffected in all groups , diverging responses were found in fa . the fa response spectrum comprised a transient depression in ph  <dig>  animals, an irregular beating behavior in ph  <dig>  animals, and a sustained beating activity in ph  <dig>  animals.

during the subsequent 18-min exposure to ambient ph  <dig> , the ph homeostasis collapsed in all acclimation groups. the extracellular ph showed a progressive decline , which corresponded to a net flux of acidic equivalents from the ambient medium into the hemolymph of  <dig> meq l- <dig> h- <dig> ,  <dig> meq l- <dig> h- <dig> , and  <dig> meq l- <dig> h- <dig> . this massive net influx of acidic equivalents is in line with reports on the breakdown of ion regulation  <cit> . in d. magna, severe acid stress resulted in a 60–70% inhibition of the unidirectional sodium influx and a 130% increase in sodium outflux  <cit> . within one hour, these animals lost 30–50% of their body sodium. the whole-body sodium concentration of d. magna is 26– <dig> mmol - <dig>  <cit> , assuming a wet-to-dry mass ratio of 10: <dig>  <cit> . this whole-body concentration is consistent with a hemolymph concentration of  <dig> mm sodium  <cit> , taking into account that the hemolymph comprises 60% of the body volume  <cit>  and that the extracellular fluid contains the main portion of whole-body sodium. the estimated net efflux of sodium  from the hemolymph of d. magna compares well with the net influx of acidic equivalents into the hemolymph of d. pulex . this shows that the disturbance in acid-base balance mirrors the disturbance in ion regulation and vice versa.

during the exposure to ambient ph  <dig> , the fa decreased strongly in all groups, whereas fh remained apparently unaffected . however, the subsequent recovery period revealed a  heart arrest and a deformation of heart structure in the ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig>  animals. their extracellular ph values during the recovery period remained  <dig>  ph units below initial  values. the ph  <dig>  animals, in contrast, were able to reduce the difference between the pre- and post-exposure values to  <dig>  units. this was the only group which survived the severe-acid test.

of all acclimation groups, the ph  <dig>  animals had the highest tolerance to severe acid stress as indicated by the lowest net influx of acidic equivalents . this implies a lower disturbance of extracellular ion regulation in the ph  <dig>  animals compared to the other two acclimation groups, which may explain the unique ability to sustain heart-beating activity in the former and heart arrest in the latter. the results of the severe-acid test further suggest that the acclimation to ambient ph  <dig>  induced a compensatory increase in active ion transport and/or a reduction in the epithelial permeability for sodium and hydrogen ions. however, the suggested reduction in epithelial ion permeability contrasts with the increased integumental permeability for respiratory gases arising from the impaired carapace formation. it therefore seems that active compensation in ion transport is the more likely defence mechanism.

interdependence between acid-base balance and co <dig> transport
information on extracellular ph in the heart region and on hemolymph bicarbonate concentration made it possible to determine the local pco <dig> in the pericardial hemolymph. in daphnids, the pericardial space receives hemolymph from the carapace lacuna, which is an important site of gas exchange  <cit> , and from the dorsal lacuna, which is fed by the current leaving the intestinal lacuna  <cit> . in the carapace lacuna, the pco <dig> is low due to the transintegumental diffusion of co <dig> from the hemolymph into the ambient medium. in the intestinal lacuna , the pco <dig> is high because metabolically produced co <dig> is released into the hemolymph. the local pco <dig> in the pericardial space therefore assumes an intermediate value that lies between the two pco <dig> extremes. the magnitude of the pco <dig> differences in the circulatory system strongly depends on the presence or absence of a carbonic anhydrase . in the absence of a ca, the interconversion between co <dig> and  proceeds slowly  <cit> . for example, a  <dig> mm bicarbonate solution with a non-bicarbonate buffer value of 2– <dig> meq l- <dig> ph- <dig> needs 3– <dig> s for a half-change in hydrogen concentration following the abrupt increase in pco <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig> kpa  <cit> . these half-equilibration times apply to 37°c, so even longer would be needed at 20°c. given a hemolymph circulation time of  <dig> s in a  <dig>  mm d. magna at 20°c  to simulate the transport of co <dig> from the tissue via the hemolymph to the ambient medium. to obtain a ph of  <dig>  at the entrance of the inner hemolymph lacuna , the krogh constant for the diffusion of co <dig> in chitin  was set to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> nmol s- <dig> mm- <dig> kpa- <dig>  to our knowledge, there are no experimental data in the literature on krogh's diffusion constant for co <dig> in chitin. nevertheless, the chosen k value is plausible insofar as it is of the same order of magnitude as krogh's diffusion constant for o <dig> in chitin   <cit> . the similarity in both values seems to contradict the well-known fact that krogh's diffusion constant for co <dig> in water and aqueous tissues is 20– <dig> times higher than that for o <dig>  a phenomenon that is explained by the higher capacitance  coefficient of co <dig> in aqueous media  <cit> . the cuticle of arthropods, however, is primarily composed of chitin fibers which are embedded in a more or less hydrated protein matrix  <cit> . among the different layers , the exocuticle is relatively dehydrated  <cit>  and may therefore establish a similar diffusion barrier for o <dig> and co <dig> 

the co <dig> transport model made it possible to follow the changes in extracellular acid-base variables during a full circulation cycle . the extracellular pco <dig> in the three hemolymph compartments varies largely between  <dig> – <dig>  kpa, whereas the extracellular ph remains confined to the narrow range of ph  <dig> – <dig> . the small changes in bicarbonate concentration  reflect the slow interconversion between co <dig> and . compared to bicarbonate, the carbonate and non-bicarbonate buffers show concentration changes in opposite direction as they are involved in the buffering of hydrogen ions arising from the hydration of co <dig> and subsequent dissociation of carbonic acid.

the simulation provides a plausible prediction of the extracellular co <dig> and ph gradients that would develop in the absence of a hemolymph ca. however, a screening of the d. pulex genome database  <cit>  unexpectedly revealed  <dig> genes with ca-like coding sequences . these genes belong to two evolutionarily unrelated ca gene families   <cit> . the derived amino-acid sequences were aligned with selected metazoan sequences   <cit>  and classified in terms of their putative destination   <cit> , based on sequence features and the known localization of cas from crab  <cit> , mosquito  <cit> , and man  <cit> . the phylogenetic analysis of α-ca sequences showed a distinct separation between mitochondrial and cytoplasmic, ca-related, membrane-bound and transmembrane, and secretory proteins . among the  <dig> α-cas from d. pulex were  <dig> sequences  with an n-terminal signal peptide for secretory export. seven of these putative extracellular isoforms are currently supported by est data. so far, nothing is is known about the extracellular target sites. to account for the possibility of ca secretion into the hemolymph, we simulated a second scenario, in which a hemolymph ca accelerates the interconversion between co <dig> and  by a factor of  <dig>  <cit> , which is sufficiently large to establish an equilibrium. krogh's diffusion constant for co <dig> in chitin was slightly reduced to  <dig>  × 10- <dig> nmol s- <dig> mm- <dig> kpa- <dig> to obtain a ph of  <dig>  at the entrance of the inner hemolymph lacuna . compared to the uncatalyzed case, the catalyzed hydration/dehydration of co <dig> significantly reduced the variations in extracellular pco <dig> to the narrow range of  <dig> – <dig>  kpa , indicating that less co <dig> is transported as physically dissolved gas. instead, more co <dig> is transported in the chemically combined form as reflected by the large variation in bicarbonate concentration. moreover, the extracellular ph varied substantially between the 'prebranchial' value of  <dig>   and the 'postbranchial' value of  <dig>  .

given are the protein names, gene model names and protein identification numbers of those loci which were annotated in the present study. protein ids indicate manually curated gene models that may differ from those contained in the 'filtered models v <dig> ' set   <cit> . the reference id can be used to retrieve the corresponding models from the filtered models set v <dig> .

the two simulated scenarios represent a coherent description of the physiological implications arising from the presence or absence of a ca in the hemolymph of d. pulex. the selected values for the global adjustment parameter k remain within reasonable bounds that made it impossible to put more weight to one of the two models. nevertheless, the predicted extracellular pco <dig> and ph gradients represent a working hypothesis that will be tested in subsequent experiments. ph imaging techniques, for example, should have the resolution power to detect a spatial in vivo gradient as large as  <dig> – <dig>  ph units to verify or falsify the assumption of ca activity in the circulatory system of d. pulex. further in vivo experiments may include the application of a strong diffusible ca inhibitor or the microinjection of an exogenous ca  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
chronic acid exposure induced pronounced effects in extracellular ph, bicarbonate concentration and co <dig> partial pressure, as well as in circulation, ventilation and energy metabolism. compensatory changes in extracellular non-bicarbonate buffering capacity and the improved tolerance to severe acid stress indicated the activation of defense mechanisms. the physiological changes were associated with an impairment of carapace formation and with reductions in reserve materials and reproduction. mechanistic analyses of the interdependence between extracellular acid-base balance and co <dig> transport led to the identification and classification of  <dig> carbonic anhydrase isoforms which are encoded in the genome of d. pulex. the multitude of physiological information that can be acquired from these transparent crustaceans via optical techniques underlines the great advantage of daphnia pulex as a model system for environmental studies. proteomic analyses are underway to identify the molecular mechanisms and target genes involved in daphnia's responses to a variety of environmental stresses including freshwater acidification.
