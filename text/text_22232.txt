BACKGROUND
ca2+ is a crucial second messenger utilized in a diverse range of cellular processes in the development of multicellular organisms  <cit> . since changes in cytosolic ca2+ trigger calcium-dependent cellular responses by activating signaling and transcriptional cascades mediated by ca2+-dependent proteins  <cit> , the levels of cytosolic ca2+ need to be highly regulated to effect appropriate developmental signaling responses. the major intracellular store of ca2+ is the endoplasmic reticulum  from where ca2+ is mobilized for signaling processes  <cit> . developmental regulation of ca2+ release from the er is critical for patterning the body plan of the vertebrate embryo  <cit> . in dorso-ventral patterning, cytosolic ca2+ activates protein kinase c and calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase ii enzymes that promote ventral fate through activation of the transcriptional regulator nfat  <cit> , and inhibits dorsal fate by antagonising components of the canonical wnt/β-catenin pathway  <cit> . the developmental regulation of the ca2+ flux between the er lumen and the cytosol, and the replenishment of ca2+ stores from extracellular ca2+ is thus likely to play a significant role in the signaling pathways that specify changes in cell phenotype.

while the ip <dig> receptor-mediated release of ca2+ from the er into the cytosol and the serca pumps that regulate ca2+ influx back into the er are well understood  <cit> , the molecular nature of the components that regulate the replenishment of ca2+ stores from the extracellular space after depletion of er stores have only recently been elucidated  <cit> . stim <dig> and orai <dig>  have been identified as critical regulators of er ca2+ homeostasis in mammalian cells  <cit> . stim <dig> is predominantly localized in the er membrane where it functions as the essential molecular sensor of er ca2+ levels. when levels are sufficiently depleted stim <dig> triggers ca2+ entry through highly selective store-operated ca2+ channels in the plasma membrane, also referred to as ca2+-release activated channels  in lymphocytes  <cit> . ca2+-depletion induces rapid aggregation of stim <dig> polypeptides within the er membrane and their subsequent translocation to specific regions of the er membrane juxtaposed to the plasma membrane  <cit> . at these sites stim <dig> activates ca2+ entry through soc channels by interacting with the cytosolic domains of orai <dig> proteins, the key molecular subunits of soc channels  <cit> . the structurally related family member stim <dig> appears to independently regulate basal er ca2+ levels  <cit>  and can also antagonise the function of stim <dig>  <cit> . both stim <dig> and stim <dig> have also been implicated in store-independent regulation of ca2+ entry  <cit> , suggesting that stim proteins may have broad roles in modulating store-operated and store-independent ca2+entry pathways in a variety of cell types.

stim <dig> and stim <dig> are known to be widely expressed in embryonic and adult tissues  <cit> , and recent genetic knockout analyses in mice indicate they have overlapping but not identical functions, and that both are required for survival beyond the first few weeks of life  <cit> . the important physiological role of stim-mediated ca2+ entry through soc  channels has been demonstrated in t lymphocyte activation and contractile function of skeletal muscle  <cit> . stim <dig> and stim <dig> expression are both critical for soc influx and nfat nuclear translocation and cytokine production in mouse t lymphocytes, as well as for the development of regulatory t cells  <cit> . defective soc entry in human lymphocytes results in severe combined immunodeficiency  <cit> . in murine skeletal muscle stim <dig> expression is also required for nfat-mediated activation of gene expression during myogenesis, with stim1-deficiency causing skeletal myopathy  <cit> . these data suggest that stim proteins might participate in calcium signaling networks by activating calcineurin/nfat pathways that intersect with other signaling pathways to regulate a wide range of developmental processes  <cit>  and are frequently deregulated in tumorigenesis  <cit> . while nfatc proteins are restricted to vertebrates, calcineurin genes are found in invertebrate organisms such as drosophila melanogaster where they, like their mammalian counterparts, have important roles in muscle development and regulation of the immune response  <cit> .

in this study we have utilized drosophila as a model to investigate the role of dstim in developmental processes in vivo, and to identify potential signaling pathways that intersect with dstim function. the single drosophila stim homologue is structurally similar to both stim <dig> and stim <dig>  <cit>  and was identified as an essential regulator of soc entry independently of mammalian stims  <cit> . dstim interacts with a single dorai protein  to activate ca2+ entry through soc channels in a similar way to the mammalian counterparts  <cit> . we have generated transgenic drosophila expressing full-length uas-dstim cdna and uas-dstim rnai constructs to determine the effects of stim <dig> overexpression and stim <dig> knockdown, respectively, in tissues expressing gal <dig> under the influence of developmentally regulated cell type-specific promoters  <cit> . we demonstrate an essential role for dstim in larval development and survival, and a tissue-specific role in cell fate specification of mechanosensory bristles in the notum and in specification of wing vein thickness. these studies are the first to demonstrate an important developmental role for the ca2+ entry regulator stim <dig> in tissue patterning.

RESULTS
dstim expression in early drosophila embryos
to detect dstim rna expression during embryonic development we performed whole mount in situ hybridization using dig-labelled rna probes . dstim rna was maternally deposited in the drosophila egg , with transcript levels decreasing as development proceeded through stages of early nuclear division, pole cell formation, syncytial blastoderm and cellularisation . dstim transcripts appeared to be specifically excluded from pole cells . during gastrulation and towards the initiation of germ-band extension transcripts were concentrated within invaginating tissues, within the ventral and cephalic furrows . this was most likely the first evidence of zygotic expression. as the germ-band fully extended, dstim transcripts appeared to be expressed in the anterior and posterior midgut primordia, and dstim expression persisted in the midgut through germ-band retraction when the anterior and posterior midguts fuse . during these stages dstim rna also appeared uniformly expressed at low levels in the ectoderm. at the start of dorsal closure dstim expression was maintained in the midgut and also appeared in the malphigian tubules, salivary glands and in specific cells clustered at intervals along the ventral midline within the central nervous system  . at later stages, approaching completion of embryonic development, dstim transcripts appeared to be uniformly expressed throughout the midgut, across the entire epidermis and in cell clusters in the cns. at all stages, control hybridization with sense rna probes produced negligible background staining .

we then assessed the localization of dstim protein by immunofluorescent staining and observed similar expression patterns to those observed with in situ hybridization . dstim first appeared to be associated with newly formed cell membranes of the blastoderm stage embryo, over the entire cell surface of each cell . the localization of dstim appeared more intense at the apical capping of cells, but uniform around the lateral and basal membranes. cytoplasmic dstim was detected in pole cells , in contrast to the absence of dstim transcripts in these cells . at later stage embryos, dstim was most evident along the ventral midline in cells situated at regular intervals between the anterior and posterior commissures of the cns , corresponding to the position of glial cells. high levels of dstim were also detected in cells of the salivary gland . embryos stained with peptide-blocked antibody were negative, demonstrating the specificity of the immunolocalization .

dstim expression in larval tissues
during the late stages of larval growth and development , dstim transcripts were uniformly expressed in wing, eye and leg imaginal discs. in the wing disc dstim transcripts were evenly distributed, with no apparent preferential localization to specific compartments, boundaries or regions . while hybridization appeared more intense within tissue folds, similar staining with sense rna probes demonstrated this to be a non-specific artifact . similar uniform patterns of expression were observed in the eye and leg discs . by immunostaining we found that dstim was uniformly expressed in the wing discs, where it was found both at the apical and basal surfaces of the columnar epithelial cells, with no evidence of a polarized distribution . this non-polarised distribution is in contrast to that of armadillo  which is localized to apical adherens junctions   <cit> , or discs large , which is primarily associated with the apico-lateral septate junctions   <cit> . wing discs incubated with peptide-blocked antibody exhibited negligible background staining, confirming the specificity of immunolocalization of dstim .

validation of dstimrnai and dstimfl expression in transgenic flies
to study the role of dstim in the fly we generated and analyzed two independent p{uas-dstimrnai} transformant lines. to determine whether dstimrnai could efficiently and specifically interfere with dstim transcripts, the level of dstim expression was analyzed by in situ hybridization and immunofluorescence in third instar wing imaginal discs expressing dstimrnai driven by en.gal <dig>  <cit> . markedly reduced levels of dstim transcripts and protein were seen within the posterior wing compartment compared to the anterior compartment expressing endogenous levels of dstim, which corresponded to the known expression domain of engrailed . substantial reduction of dstim trancripts was also observed in the stage  <dig> embryo expressing dstimrnai driven by en.gal <dig>  with loss of expression in ectodermal stripes corresponding to sites of engrailed expression . in addition, transient co-expression of dstimrnai with dstimfl in s <dig> cells reduced expression of dstim protein to background levels as measured by western blotting . these data provide evidence that dstimrnai was expressed in the correct domain in transgenic embryos and caused substantial posttranscriptional interference with dstim. analysis of the effects of dstimrnai expression in the wings of flies lacking one functional copy of dstim  showed that the level of rnai-mediated silencing was not equivalent to a complete knockout of gene expression but represented a substantial knockdown. no off-target 19-mer matches were detected when the  <dig> bp dsrna sequence was analysed using the dsrna verification algorithm at . moreover, adult patterning defects produced from en.gal <dig> and sd.gal <dig>  driven expression of dstimrnai could be completely rescued by co-expression of dstimfl, indicating that observed phenotypes were the result of specific reduction in dstim levels.

for analysis of dstim overexpression, four independent p{uas-dstimfl} transformant lines were generated and characterized. analysis of dstimfl expression using the en.gal <dig> driver showed dstim transcripts and protein were significantly upregulated in the posterior wing compartment .

modulating dstim expression in early development
rnai-mediated knockdown
to study the effect of dstimrnai during embryogenesis we used the da.gal <dig> and e22c.gal <dig> drivers to induce ubiquitous expression of rnai in the embryo. this resulted in late 2nd to early 3rd instar larval lethality, with considerable variability between the progeny. larvae appeared contracted and not highly active, but detailed examination indicated they were normal in size with normal patterning of denticle belts. an obvious characteristic of all transgenic larvae was the transparency of fat body cells, suggestive of inadequate nutrition or storage of nutrients. the specific cause of larval immobility and death was not determined.

transgenic overexpression
the da.gal <dig> and e22c.gal <dig> drivers were also used to analyze the effects of dstimfl overexpression during embryogenesis. embryos expressing dstimfl did not survive beyond the early 3rd instar larval stage, with lethality at a similar stage to embryos expressing dstimrnai. these data indicate that neither overexpression nor reduction of dstim expression in the early embryo cause major problems with embryonic patterning but most likely cause more subtle defects in muscle or neural development necessary for nutrition that are incompatible with larval hatching and survival. we did not ascertain whether the same cell lineages were affected in embryos expressing dstimfl and in those expressing dstimrnai.

modulating dstim expression in the eye
rnai-mediated knockdown
since dstim is highly expressed in the eye imaginal disc, we firstly used the ey.gal <dig> driver to induce expression of dstimrnai during early specification and growth of the eye disc  <cit> . expression of dstimrnai resulted in no observable phenotypic abnormalities in eye development , indicating that the levels of endogenous dstim expression are not essential for the proper patterning and development of the eye, or that sufficient dstim is still translated to perform its normal function during eye development.

we next used three gal <dig> drivers to induce expression of dstimrnai in different cell populations during later stages of eye development: gmr.gal <dig> to drive expression in all disc cells formed behind the morphogenetic furrow, lz.gal <dig> to drive expression in cone and pigment cells and photoreceptors, and sca.gal <dig> to drive expression in sensory organ precursors  <cit> . expression of dstimrnai using any of these drivers had no observable effects on eye phenotype .

transgenic overexpression
when dstimfl was overexpressed in the eye imaginal disc using the ey.gal <dig> driver adult eyes were significantly smaller than those of wild-type flies , with abnormally shaped ommatidia . rather than the normal hexagonal lattice with bristles positioned at alternating vertices, the facets had a tetragonal  configuration with bristles at each corner. some vertices had duplicated bristles due to the altered packing of the facets. tangential sections through the eye revealed normal numbers and orientation of photoreceptors in each tetragonal ommatidial unit .

overexpression of dstimfl at later stages using gmr.gal <dig>  sca.gal <dig> and lz.gal <dig> drivers had no visible effects on eye size, but resulted in loss of interommatidial bristles, giving rise to a 'shaven' phenotype . interommatidial bristles were absent when dstimfl was expressed within the bristle progenitor cells under the influence of the gmr.gal <dig>  and sca.gal <dig>  drivers, as well as when dstimfl was expressed in ommatidial cells but not in the bristle progenitors under the influence of the lz.gal <dig> driver . these observations suggest that the effects of dstimfl overexpression are not restricted to a specific cell population within the developing eye. flies expressing dstimfl driven by gmr.gal <dig> and lz.gal <dig> also had mild roughening of the eye , although tangential sections showed no abnormalities in the photoreceptor clusters that generally underlie a roughened phenotype .

modulating dstim expression in the notum
we analyzed the role of dstim in the development of the notum by inducing expression of dstimrnai and dstimfl in the mesothoracic disc using the pnr.gal <dig> driver. expression of dstimrnai resulted in a partially bald notum, with loss of mechanosensory bristles . microchaetes were missing from the domain of highest pannier expression  <cit> , while macrochaetes, which develop later than machrochaetes, appeared to be largely unaffected. in contrast, overexpression of dstimfl driven by pnr.gal <dig> and sca.gal <dig> in sensory organ precursors and ms <dig> gal <dig>  produced misorientated and twin-shafted mechanosensory bristles , with microchaetes again being mostly affected. thus dstimrnai and overexpression of dstim have opposite effects on the development of mechanosensory bristles.

modulating dstim expression in the wing
to determine the role of dstim in patterning of the fly wing several gal <dig> drivers were used to target expression of dstimrnai and dstimfl in different compartments of the developing wing: en.gal <dig> in the posterior wing compartment ; ms <dig> gal <dig> in the dorsal compartment of the wing pouch  <cit> ; sd.gal <dig> in the entire wing pouch  <cit> , 32b.gal <dig> in the entire wing disc  <cit> , and sca.gal <dig> in sensory organ precursors.

rnai-mediated knockdown
we observed that expression of dstimrnai induced by all gal <dig> drivers except sca.gal <dig> caused thickening of wing veins, with no other patterning abnormalities being evident . the severity of the phenotype was increased by either the copy number of transgenes, or when the temperature was increased to 25°c or to 29°c to enhance gal <dig> activity . expression of dstimrnai in the dorsal wing pouch using the m <dig> gal <dig> driver produced the most severe phenotype, with pronounced thickening of veins iii, iv and v . vein thickening was confined to the posterior wing when en.gal <dig> was used to drive dstimrnai . vein thickening was associated with an apparent reduction in wing blade size, most evident when expression of dstimrnai was induced with ms <dig> gal <dig> and sd.gal <dig> drivers . the smaller wing size may be the result of inadequate wing inflation  <cit> .

to determine whether the effects of rnai were hypomorphic or nullimorphic, we tested the effects of dstimrnai induced with the en.gal <dig> driver in a dstim hemizygous background using the dfsd72a strain which expresses only one copy of dstim. we observed a severely enhanced 'thick vein' phenotype , demonstrating that while dstimrnai caused specific and efficient posttranscriptional silencing of dstim  the level of silencing was not equivalent to a complete 'knockout', but rather represented a 'knockdown'. the 'thick vein' phenotype observed with dstimrnai was completely reversed when dstimrnai was co-expressed with dstimfl driven by en.gal <dig> , further demonstrating that the observed silencing correlates with a "knockdown' effect, but also validating that re-expression of dstim rescues the phenotype observed consequent to reduced dstim levels.

transgenic overexpression
we next analyzed the effects of overexpressing dstimfl in the developing wing and observed significant wing margin defects with the en.gal <dig>  sd.gal <dig> and 32b.gal <dig> drivers . when expression of dstimfl was induced by en.gal <dig> wings displayed regions of margin loss  confined to the posterior wing margin , while both anterior and posterior wing margins were notched when expression was induced by 32b.gal <dig> and sd.gal <dig> drivers . whichever of these drivers was used, the margin at the distal wing tip was never compromised. expression of dstimfl in the dorsal compartment driven by ms <dig> gal <dig> had no effect on the wing margin, but resulted in smaller sized wings , which were blistered as a result of uneven growth of the dorsal compartment relative to the ventral compartment which does not express ms <dig> gal <dig>  increasing the number of transgene copies or increasing the temperature to 29°c led to further reduction in wing size , loss of some mechanosensory bristles along the wing margin, and multiple wing hairs   as well as duplication of campaniform sensilla  . duplication of margin bristles was observed when dstimfl expression was driven by two copies of sca.gal <dig> . some wings also exhibited irregular venation, with appearance of ectopic veins in the i-ii region and deltas at the ends of veins iv and v . distal loss of vein v was seen when expression was driven by ms <dig> gal <dig> . to determine whether reduced wing size of flies expressing dstimfl was due to increased cell death, 3rd instar wing discs were stained with acridine orange. limited cell death was seen in control ms <dig> gal <dig> wing discs, while cells in wing discs expressing dstimfl driven by ms <dig> gal <dig> showed extensive acridine orange staining , indicative of an increased rate of apoptosis.

genetic interactions between dstim and notch signaling in the wing
the notch signaling pathway plays an important role in developmental processes of the fly notum, eye and wing that were influenced by altering dstim expression levels. in the wing, notch signaling specifies both the patterning of vein thickness and the development of the wing margin. we thus investigated whether dstim interacts genetically with notch in wing development. we determined whether notch signaling is suppressed in the dstim transgenic wings, by analyzing the effects of dstimrnaiand dstimfl expression in dfn81k <dig> flies that lack one functional notch allele. flies hemizygous for notch n81k1) displayed mildly thickened veins, deltas at the distal ends of wing veins and margin defects particularly at the distal tip . this vein patterning phenotype was essentially identical to dstimrnai driven by en.gal <dig> introduced from the male parent , and less severe than when introduced from the female parent . rnai-mediated knockdown of dstim driven by en.gal <dig> on the dfn81k <dig> background significantly enhanced vein thickening in the posterior region of the wing but had no additional effects on patterning of the wing margins . expression of a constitutively activated notch allele  induced by a maternally introduced en.gal <dig> caused a reduction in the length of lateral vein v . co-expression of tnΔbrv with dstimrnai resulted in mutual suppression of both phenotypes . overexpression of dstimfl on the dfn81k background significantly enhanced margin loss .

these data demonstrate that the effects of rnai-mediated knockdown of dstim on wing vein thickness and transgenic overexpression of dstim on wing margin loss are both enhanced in a notch deficiency background, indicating a potential genetic interaction between dstim and notch in wing development

effects of dstim expression on wingless signaling
the patterned adult wing originates along the dorso-ventral  boundary, which is specified through activation of notch at the interface between the dorsal and ventral compartments of the wing disc  <cit> . notch activates wingless  and other genes along the d/v boundary  <cit>  and notch and wg are required together to activate cut, a regulator of sensory organ identity in the boundary cells at the wing margin  <cit> . secreted wg that is produced in the d/v cells diffuses across the neighbouring dorsal and ventral compartments forming a morphogenetic gradient that activates various downstream outputs, such as the proneural gene achaete  in the sensory organ precursors  bordering the d/v boundary, and distal-less , a regulator of wing growth  <cit> . wg also stabilizes cellular levels of armadillo , the major transcriptional regulator activated by canonical wg signaling  <cit> . to determine whether dstim overexpression causes wing margin defects by influencing wg signaling, we analyzed the effects of dstimfl expression on activation of these wg signaling outputs.

immunostaining was used to detect expression of wg, cut, ac and dll in 3rd instar wing discs isolated from wild-type flies and flies expressing dstimfl driven by sd.gal <dig> . a marked reduction in the thickness of the band of d/v boundary cells expressing wg was observed in wing discs expressing dstimfl , and cut expression was also reduced at the outer margins of the discs . in addition, fewer ac-expressing cells were seen, reflecting the reduced number of sensory bristles in the adult wings . expression of wg, cut and ac was not affected in the central region at the d/v margin , an area that develops into the distal wing tip margin unaffected by dstimfl overexpression. a marked reduction in dll expression was also evident in the dorsal and ventral compartments of wing discs expressing dstimfl . overexpression of dstimfl driven by ms <dig> gal <dig> caused a significant reduction in the levels of cytoplasmic arm . these results show that all wg signaling outputs are reduced at the d/v margin when dstim is overexpressed. we could not detect any effect on arm expression in wing discs expressing dstimrnai, which is consistent with the absence of margin defects in the adult wing .

discussion
these studies demonstrate that while dstim is ubiquitously expressed in drosophila embryonic and larval tissues, these endogenous levels of dstim expression are not essential for many developmental processes. rnai-mediated posttranscriptional knockdown of dstim expression in the early embryo had no observable effects on growth or patterning of larvae, but did cause lethality by early 3rd instar stages. reduced mobility of larvae suggested functional defects in myogenic and/or neurogenic lineages that could affect nutrient intake and metabolism. this late embryo lethal phenotype was also observed when dstim was overexpressed at early stages, indicating that normal tissue function is dependent on the maintenance of correct levels of dstim expression and thus highly regulated ca2+ entry at these stages. stim1-deficiency in mouse embryos influences the development and contractile function of skeletal muscle  <cit> , and deficiencies in either stim <dig> or stim <dig> cause perinatal lethality but do not interfere with early processes of embryonic growth and development  <cit> . likewise, stim1-knockdown in the c. elegans nematode does not result in embryonic lethality, but reduces the contraction of sheath cells that trigger spermathecal opening for ovulation, and results in complete sterility  <cit> . together these studies indicate that many cell types in developing invertebrate and mammalian embryos are not reliant on high levels of stim expression for survival, proliferation and differentiation, and may regulate ca2+ influx through stim-independent mechanisms. since rnai did not cause complete knockout of dstim gene expression generation of flies having a null mutation in dstim will be necessary to determine the absolute requirement of dstim in developing drosophila tissues, as will an analysis of the phenotype of double stim1/stim <dig> knockout mice.

using rnai-mediated knockdown in imaginal discs we have shown that dstim does have an essential and very specific developmental role in tissue patterning and cell fate specification in the wing and the notum, but not in the eye. absence of an eye phenotype could indicate either inadequate knockdown of dstim expression with any of the gal <dig> drivers used or that dstim is indeed not required for normal eye development. knockdown of dstim expression in the developing wing resulted in significant vein thickening with no other observable patterning defects, while dstim-deficiency in the mesothoracic disc resulted in loss of mechanosensory bristles  on the notum. notch signaling plays a key role in these two independent developmental processes and we have demonstrated a genetic interaction between dstim and notch function in the wing. notch signaling normally acts to prevents cells adopting a vein cell fate by inhibiting activation of the egfr pathway and subsequent activation of the dpp pathway  <cit> , such that inhibition of notch signaling promotes the differentiation of provein territory into vein tissues and gives rise to abnormally thickened veins  <cit> . we observed enhancement of vein thickening when notch deficiency was combined with dstim knockdown, and showed that the activated notch allele, tnΔbrv, an allele known to rescue most notch hypomorphic alleles  <cit> , was able to suppress the rnai-mediated dstim deficiency. these results suggest that dstim function specifically intersects with regulators of notch signaling during regulation of vein differentiation.

the phenotypic effects of dstim knockdown and dstim overexpression in the mesothorax indicate a role for dstim in cell fate specification in the mechanosensory bristle cell lineage, a process also regulated by notch signaling. the absence of mechanosensory bristles  on the notum in flies expressing dstimrnai is consistent with a neurogenic phenotype, representing preferential neuronal specification of both daughter cells from the sensory organ precursor   <cit> . overexpression of dstim resulted in exactly the opposite phenotype, with the development of twin-shafted or duplicated bristles. while the underlying cellular basis for these phenotypes was not ascertained in this study, the data are consistent with defects either in the asymmetric division of sop cells, or the process of lateral inhibition that specifies sop cells within each proneural cluster in the notum, both of which are principally regulated by notch signaling  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in the notch receptor and in positive regulators of notch cause a 'bald' neurogenic phenotype due to aberrant division and specification of daughter cells  <cit> . a similar neurogenic phenotype is caused by gain-of-function mutations in the notch antagonist, numb, while loss-of-function mutations in numb result in the formation of duplicated bristles  <cit> . asymmetric segregation of numb during sop cell division determines the level of notch signaling in the daughter cells  <cit> . numb is a target of the ca2+ -dependent kinase camkii  <cit> , and its polarized distribution has been shown to be regulated by apkc phosphorylation  <cit> , suggesting that numb localization and function may be regulated by ca2+ -dependent mechanisms. our data suggest that stim-mediated ca2+ entry may potentially influence the cellular localization and/or activity of numb or other notch regulators. it is interesting that notch signaling in mammalian cells has been linked to a calcineurin-dependent mechanism that activates nfat  <cit> , a pathway that is regulated by mammalian stim <dig>  <cit> . while ca2+ -regulated nfat homologues have not been identified in drosophila  <cit> , genetic screens have identified dstim as a regulator of nuclear translocation and dephosphorylation of nfat  <cit>  and drosophila calcineurin homologues regulate other target proteins, such as egfr  <cit> . our results suggest that notch and dstim may intersect at a functional level through activation of calcineurin independently of nfatc proteins in drosophila, and further studies are now required to elucidate the molecular nature of these interactions.

apart from development of the mechanosensory bristle cell lineage in the mesothorax, overexpression of dstim did not have opposite developmental effects to those of dstim deficiency. dstim overexpression caused the misorientation of the ommatidial lattice in the eye and inhibited the formation of interommatidial bristles, and disrupted development of the wing margin, processes that were not influenced by dstim deficiency but are known to be regulated by notch signaling. a secreted dominant-negative form of the notch ligand serrate , and the glycosyl transferase fringe  are both negative regulators of notch signaling, and their expression in the early eye results in reduced eye size and square rather than hexagonal ommatidial facets  <cit> . in addition, overexpression of sers in the wing results in wing margin loss and downregulation of wg and cut at the wing margin  <cit> . loss-of-function mutations in either the notch receptor or in activators of notch signaling result in loss of interommatidial bristles in the eye  <cit> . the similarity of these eye and wing phenotypes to those resulting from dstim overexpression support the proposal that dstim overexpression negatively regulates notch signaling at these sites.

the developmental defects associated with dstim overexpression are also consistent with dominant effects of abnormally increased intracellular ca2+ levels causing enhanced activity of ca2+-dependent processes. a major effect of increased intracellular ca2+ in many cell types is the induction of apoptotic cell death  <cit> , and smaller eyes and wings were seen in flies overexpressing dstim, with increased apoptotic cell death observed in the wing disc. observations of increased growth arrest and apoptosis in some mammalian cell lines overexpressing stim <dig> led to the initial hypothesis that stim <dig> functions as a tumour suppressor  <cit> . in addition to induction of apoptosis we have demonstrated that wing margin defects caused by overexpression of dstim in the wing disc were associated with decreased expression of arm  and other wg signalling outputs at the wing margin, demonstrating inhibition of canonical wg signaling. while these effects may simply reflect a dependence on notch activity at the wing margin  <cit> , a direct interaction between dstim and wg signaling is also possible. intracellular ca2+ is an important second messenger in non-canonical wg/wnt signaling pathways that primarily modulate cell polarity and movement, including the vertebrate wnt/ca2+ pathway that activates pkc and camkii, and the planar cell polarity  pathway that activates jun-n-terminal kinase   <cit> . induction of ca2+ release by non-canonical wnt ligands activates pkc and camkii enzymes that can antagonize components of β-catenin signaling  <cit> , as observed in our study. the drosophila pcp pathway plays a fundamental role in the orientation of hairs, bristles and ommatidia  <cit> , and development of multiple wing hairs  <cit>  which are all observed with overexpression of dstim. planar polarity defects are generated by abnormal segregation or random dispersion of proteins, including the non-canonical wg components fz, and dsh, that normally provide the cell with polarity cues  <cit> . these data support a potential role of dstim in providing ca2+ dependent mechanisms for determining asymmetric protein localization within the cell. while stim proteins are major regulators of ca2+ entry through activation of soc channels, there is increasing evidence for their role in store-independent ca2+ entry mechanisms  <cit> . identification of the single drosophila homologue of the soc channel subunit protein orai  <cit>  will now allow a detailed analysis of soc function during drosophila development. comparison of phenotypes caused by mutations in dstim and in dorai will indicate whether the effects of dstim knockdown observed in this study are due specifically to a reduction in soc-mediated ca2+ entry or whether dstim plays a role in developmental processes by mediating other pathways of ca2+ entry. preliminary evidence from a genetic screen to identify molecules that affect vein patterning in the drosophila wing suggests that ectopic expression of dorai may have similar patterning effects  to ectopic dstim  <cit> .

aberrant expression of stim <dig> and stim <dig> proteins has been associated with human cancer  <cit>  but their direct role in tumorigenic events has yet to be established. however, a recent study has identified stim <dig> as a putative target of β-catenin/tcf in colorectal cancer . deregulation of ca2+ homeostasis and ca2+-mediated signaling events have been implicated in tumorigenesis  <cit> , and using drosophila as a model organism to determine how regulators of ca2+ homeostasis interact with developmental pathways such as wnt and notch will reveal potential mechanisms that can be further analysed in mammalian systems.

CONCLUSIONS
the results presented here are the first to describe a developmental function of ca2+ entry mediated by dstim. while the precise molecular mechanisms cannot be elucidated from these studies we have identified notch signaling as a potential pathway to be dependent on dstim-mediated ca2+ entry in certain cell types and wg signaling to be influenced by dstim overexpression. the recent association of stim <dig> with colorectal cancer also highlights the relevance of this family of proteins to molecular pathways that regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. a crucial aspect of ca2+ signaling is the necessity to generate localized transient elevations in ca2+ concentrations at important target sites within the cells. it is noteworthy that the developmental processes affected by alterations in dstim expression involve asymmetric cellular distribution of signaling components that establish spatial patterns and determine cell fate. the localization and translocation of stim proteins in specialized regions of the er place it in a good position to regulate highly localized ca2+ entry through the plasma membrane. analysis of the co-localization of dstim activity with ca2+ dependent signaling will be a major step forward in determining whether dstim has an important role in regulating localized ca2+-dependent signaling events that are critical for normal development, and can be aberrant in tumorigenesis.
