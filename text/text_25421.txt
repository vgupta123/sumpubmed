BACKGROUND
repetitive elements constitute over 50% of the human genomic sequence  <cit> . the most prevalent repeats are the alu family of sines, which comprise approximately 10% of the human genome. a typical alu element is approximately  <dig> bp long and contains two almost identical arms separated by an a-rich sequence. the ancestor of the alu monomer is the  <dig> sl rna gene, which encodes the rna component of the signal recognition particle  that is involved in the translocation of newly synthesized proteins  <cit> . similar to the  <dig> sl gene, alu elements with intact promoters - namely a and b boxes - may be transcribed by rna polymerase iii  <cit> . with the aid of the line-encoded retrotransposition machinery, alu transcripts gain mobility and expand in genomes through a process involving reverse transcription and integration  <cit> .

alu retrotransposition has been an important molecular evolutionary force reshaping the primate genomes  <cit> . the expansion of the alu elements in the primate genomes is dated at least  <dig> million years ago  <cit> . based on their evolutionary history, alu elements can be classified in three major subfamilies: aluj, alus, and aluy  <cit> . among them, the youngest alu elements - aluy and its variants aluya-g - remain very active, and exhibit the highest rate of retrotransposition in the human genome  <cit> . while several recent studies have shown that line- <dig> elements contribute substantially to the structural variations observed in the human genome  <cit> , the retrotransposition rate of alu elements is ten times higher than that of line- <dig>  with an estimated new insertion at every  <dig> births  <cit> .

decades of research have demonstrated that alu elements play important roles in the genome and transcriptome  <cit> . alu elements may contribute a large number of transcription factor binding sites  <cit> , some of which may serve as enhancers involved in tissue development  <cit> . in addition, some alu elements may be expressed and alu transcription affects nearby gene expression, distal gene expression, and global translation. for instance, the expression of an alu in the promoter of an epsilon-globin gene was found to negatively regulate globin gene expression by transcriptional interference  <cit> . recently, alu rna was found to be a modular transacting repressor of mrna transcription  <cit> . interestingly, such transcriptional suppression was found to be specific and limited to certain genes. alu rnas also affect translational initiation and were found to form stable, discrete complexes with the double-stranded rna-activated kinase pkr, and to antagonize pkr activation  <cit> . transcription derepression of otherwise active alu elements, which so often reside within genes, may lead to the formation of double-strand rna - if in antisense orientation - and ultimately to heterochromatinization and silencing of the gene  <cit> .

one of the key mechanisms controlling alu expression is dna methylation. the human genome has approximately  <dig> million cpg dinucleotides,  <dig> million of which are found within alu elements  <cit> . in most somatic tissues, the cpg dinucleotides within the alu sequence are heavily methylated to suppress alu expression  <cit> . it has been demonstrated that the a and b boxes  are critical cis-elements for alu expression. in particular, methylation of the b box is thought to inhibit protein binding and hence block alu transcription  <cit> . albeit not sufficient, demethylation and consequently transcription of alu elements is required for occurrence of de novo retrotransposition  <cit> . methylated cpgs can undergo deamination and thereby lead to mutations that render them unable for retrotransposition  <cit> .

although much effort has been made to identify structural variations resulting from alu integration, much less is known with regard to the epigenetic status of newly inserted elements and of their flanking genomic sequences. here we report the utilization of an alu-anchored bisulfite pcr strategy to generate methylation maps for thousands of alu elements in human cerebellum and in ependymomas  <cit> . in this approach, most of the targeted alu elements are members of the active aluy subfamilies. in this study, we analyzed the aforementioned datasets to identify newly integrated alu elements, to investigate sequence characteristics and commonalities of their integration sites, to uncover their methylation statuses, and to determine whether the methylation patterns of the sequences surrounding their integration sites would be altered in the alleles harboring the insertion in individuals hemizygous for the alu retrotransposon.

RESULTS
identification of recent alu insertions
the method developed by xie and colleagues was initially designed to generate a methylation map for a subset of young alu elements  <cit> . the strategy applied a primer targeting cpg-rich alu repeats to simultaneously amplify thousands of alu elements and their 5' flanking sequences. unequivocal mapping of these repeats was therefore achieved through their - most often unique - 5' flanking sequences. eight alu libraries were derived with this strategy, six from ependymomas and two from normal brain tissues  <cit> .

in previous studies, a number of sequence reads from these libraries could only be partially mapped to the human reference sequence. in order to determine whether any of these sequence reads corresponded to a novel alu integration event, i.e. one that was not yet documented in the ucsc database, we designed a computational pipeline to reanalyze these datasets . for  <dig>  sequence reads partially mapped in previous studies, we first masked alu sequences and then selected the ones containing at least  <dig> bp of 5' flanking sequences. a total of  <dig>  sequence reads were thus identified. the alu flanking sequences were then extracted from these reads and subjected to megablast against in silico bisulfite converted human reference genome sequence. unambiguous mapping was achieved for  <dig>  sequence reads. as expected, the majority of these reads  mapped to genomic sequences adjacent to an alu element. further examination of the remaining  <dig>  sequences reads  enabled their grouping into  <dig> clusters according to their genomic coordinates . it is noteworthy that due to the highly stringent mapping criteria applied in our previous studies  <cit> , a few mismatches in the alignments between the reference genomic sequence and the sequences generated from the alu libraries were sufficient to lead to their classification as "partially mapped" reads.

we examined the distribution of the  <dig> clusters comprised of  <dig>  sequences reads in eight alu-anchored bisulfite pcr libraries . out of  <dig> clusters,  <dig> clusters  were found to be supported by more than one sequence read and  <dig> clusters  were found to be present in more than one library. among these  <dig> clusters,  <dig> clusters  were found in both normal and tumor tissues. this indicates that a majority of these putative insertions are not associated with tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression. in addition, a library derived from a normal brain tissue contributed  <dig> clusters  with  <dig> sequence reads , while a library derived from a relapsed aggressive ependymoma only contributed  <dig> clusters with  <dig> sequence reads. based on the difference in number of sequence reads generated from each library, we normalized - for each library - the number of putative insertions that were identified, to the number of alu repeats that were successfully mapped to the reference genome. no significant difference was observed in this ratio between normal and tumor tissues .

to investigate whether these putatively new alu insertions had been identified in previous studies, we extracted  <dig>  and  <dig> known polymorphic alu elements from dbsnp   <cit>  and dbrip   <cit> , respectively. this analysis revealed that  <dig> of the  <dig> clusters were novel, i.e. they corresponded to yet undocumented de novo retrotransposition events. the putative integration sites of  <dig> of such clusters  were found to localize to intronic regions, except for one, which mapped to the 3'-utr of tomm <dig>  a gene that codes for the translocase of the mitochondrial outer membrane  complex. we further analyzed these genes with ncbi's david functional annotation tool to examine whether any specific gene category was more likely to harbor these alu insertions. one hundred thirty-two genes were found annotated in the ncbi database. compared to all genes annotated in the human genome, no significant enrichment was identified for this set of  <dig> genes in terms of biological process, cellular localization or molecular function .

verification of recent alu insertions
to validate the evolutionarily recent alu de novo retrotransposition events identified in this study, we randomly selected twenty-one genomic loci encompassing such putative new alu insertions. for each genomic locus, we designed primers based on the upstream and downstream sequences surrounding the predicted integration sites. with these primers, the pcr products were expected to be ~ <dig> bp  or ~ <dig> bp . due to the diploidy of the human genome, three kinds of pcr results were expected:  hemizygous alu insertion: pcr products of two different sizes were expected, one fragment with the alu insertion and another without it ;  homozygous alu insertion: only one pcr product was expected, this fragment containing an alu element ;  nulizygous alu insertion: no alu insertion was present in either homologous chromosome, hence just one small pcr product  was expected.

the alu insertions were successfully verified for forty-seven out of forty-nine cases representing nineteen genomic loci . to ensure that the regions amplified by pcr were indeed new alu insertions, for each locus, pcr products were cloned and sequence-verified. the sequences representing these nineteen genomic loci were submitted to genbank. their accession numbers are: . fourteen out of the nineteen insertion events were predicted to occur in more than one individual. interestingly, we found that nine out of these fourteen insertions were hemizygous in all individuals examined - i.e., the alu insertion only occurred in one of the two homologous chromosomes. the remaining five insertions were hemizygous for some individuals and homozygous for others. from a total of forty-seven alu insertions, thirty-six were found to be hemizygous and eleven were found to be homozygous. the fact that the majority of the insertions have remained in hemizygosity in the genome may be interpreted as suggestive of their recent evolutionary origin. however, that will remain speculative until populational studies are performed.

genomic features and sequence characteristics of alu elements and their flanking sequences
it has been shown that polymorphic alu elements and their flanking sequences may share some distinct sequence features  <cit> . the alu transcripts derived from the ones with conserved structure would interact productively with srp9/ <dig> host proteins and gain the ability to retrotranspose  <cit> . the aluy subfamily and its variants yc <dig>  yc <dig>  ya <dig>  ya5a <dig>  ya <dig>  yd <dig>  yb <dig>  and yb <dig>  are the ones considered to be very active due to the conservation of its structure. to conclude the analysis, we classified the alu elements identified in this study according to its family of origin. we found that the new insertions identified in this study belong to the relatively recent family of aluy elements or to the subfamilies aluya <dig>  aluyb <dig>  aluyb <dig>  and aluyg <dig>  it has also been shown that the occurrence of a longer poly tail might facilitate alu retrotransposition  <cit> . our analysis revealed that all twenty-two new alu insertions that were sequence verified in this study have an a-tail that ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with an average length of  <dig> bp.

alu retrotransposition is facilitated by line- <dig> elements. line elements encompass two open reading frames, namely orf <dig> and orf2p. orf <dig> encodes a non-specific rna binding protein, and orf2p encodes an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase. during the process of retrotransposition orf2p cleaves genomic dna at a degenerate consensus sequence . accordingly, the presence of a tt/aaaa sequence motif in the 5'-flanking region seems essential for alu insertion  <cit> . the alu insertion site is generated by a single-strand break that occurs in the target dna made by orf2p. the mechanism of alu insertion is called target primed reverse transcription   <cit> . indeed, we were able to document the occurrence of this sequence motif - either a perfect match or a highly similar sequence - in the 5' flanking regions of all new alu insertions that were sequence-verified in this study. for the nineteen alu insertions identified in this study, the characteristic sequence features of alu and flanking sequences are summarized in table  <dig> 

in addition to the alu sequence itself, the genomic sequence adjacent to the recent alu insertions encompass at least two typical sequences. as a hallmark of a recent retrotransposition event, the sequences immediately flanking the alu elements corresponded to short direct repeats, ranging from 4- <dig> nucleotides. the insertion mechanism generates direct target site duplications  flanking the newly inserted element. these tsds have variable length and are highly suggestive of line mediated endonucleolytic cleavage  <cit> . such short direct repeats, also called at-rich target site duplications, were present in  <dig> of the sequence-verified genomic loci .

methylation status of recent alu elements
all sequences generated in our previous studies, encompassing alu elements and their 5' flanking sequences, were derived from bisulfite converted genomic dna  <cit> . due to the high frequency of c-to-t transitions in cpg dinucleotides of alu repeats caused by deamination of the methylated cytosines, in the absence of a reference genomic sequence, one cannot determine the methylation status of a novel alu insertion by this method. hence, to examine the methylation pattern of the newly integrated alu elements, we aligned the sequences generated in this study for nineteen of such alu elements with their bisulfite converted sequences from our previous studies  <cit>  . our results showed that the recently inserted alu elements are heavily methylated, with an average methylation level of  <dig> %; this is similar to the average methylation level observed for evolutionarily young non-polymorphic alu elements  <cit> . we further examined the methylation status of the two important promoter regions inside the alu elements, the a and b boxes. alu elements have a bipartite structure, which is similar to that of trna elements. it has been shown that the a box is responsible for determining the strength of the pol iii promoter and the b box is important in enabling transcription  <cit> . also, deletion of the b box sequence completely abolished transcription of the elements, while deletion of the a box reduced the efficiency of transcription  <cit> . in almost all cases, these promoter sequences were methylated . this result suggests that transcription of most newly inserted alu elements is suppressed by dna methylation.

interestingly, we found one alu element at chr9:37594172- <dig> with a completely unmethylated 5'-end . since amongst all alu elements chosen for verification this was the only element found to be unmethylated, and also because only two bisulfite sequence reads had been previously generated for this element  <cit> , we designed bisulfite pcr primers to amplify the entire alu element including the two flanking cpg dinucleotides . indeed, the 5'-end of this newly inserted alu element was found to be completely unmethylated while its 3'-end exhibited some degree of dna methylation. it is noteworthy that the 5'-flanking cpg site was completely unmethylated, and the 3'-flanking cpg site was completely methylated. importantly, the 5' terminal nucleotide of this newly inserted alu element mapped  <dig>  bp downstream from a cpg island and  <dig>  bp downstream from the transcription start site of the tomm <dig> gene. this result suggests that the methylation status of this alu element is under the influence of the epigenetic environment surrounding its insertion site. since this alu insertion was found to be in homozygosity, i.e. it was present in the two homologous chromosomes, we were not able to investigate whether the alu insertion exerted any influence on the methylation status of cpg dinucleotides flanking the alu element. to confirm our hypothesis that the methylation of the alu element is under the influence of the cpg island, we ascertained the methylation status of a fragment  corresponding to the 5' terminal  <dig> bp of the cpg island, and also of the alujo element flanking the 3'end  of the newly identified alu element that was partially methylated. indeed, we found that this cpg island fragment was completely unmethylated while the alujo sequence flanking the 3'end of the newly inserted alu exhibited a methylation level of the order of 40%. interestingly, this alujo exhibited a pattern of methylation very similar to the pattern presented by the newly inserted alu element . there are  <dig> alu repeats and  <dig> mir element localized between the newly inserted alu and the cpg island. the methylation levels of these elements are indeed very low .

we conducted similar analysis to two other genomic loci, chr10:72605338- <dig> and chr2:48276482- <dig>  which were randomly chosen. the alu insertions on these two loci were found to be in hemizygosity. this allowed us to compare the methylation status of the alleles with and without the alu insertion . the sequencing results derived from bisulfite-pcr cloning demonstrated that both newly inserted alu elements were indeed heavily methylated, as anticipated based upon our previously generated high-throughput bisulfite sequencing data . in addition, for the two genomic loci examined, there was no methylation difference between the alleles with and without the alu insertion in the two homologous chromosomes, nor was there a difference in the methylation statuses of the cpg dinucleotides flanking the chr2:48276482- <dig> alu insertion site. furthermore, the cpg dinucleotide that is immediately downstream of the chr10:72605338- <dig> alu insertion site was also found to be methylated. due to the low cpg density of its 5' flanking genomic sequence, no methylation data were derived for the region upstream of chr10:72605338- <dig>  to identify methylation differences among samples, we calculated the methylation level of all mapped alu elements, and also that of the structural variants present in the  <dig> loci verified. this analysis revealed no methylation differences among tissues .

discussion
recent studies demonstrated that major structural variants in the human genome are derived from retrotransposons, alu elements in particular  <cit> . due to the extensive sequence homology that exists among young alu repeats, the identification of such structural variants remains a challenging task. to date, a total of  <dig>  polymorphic alu retrotransposons have been reported to occur in human populations,  <dig>  of which have been deposited in dbsnp and  <dig> in dbrip. in this study we implemented a computational pipeline to identify recent alu insertions, and examined the methylation status of the newly inserted alu retrotransposons and their flanking sequences. at the time we developed this strategy the genome sequencer flx system was the most suitable alternative available, given the greater length of the sequence reads that it generates, and the fact that sequences would encompass an alu repeat and would be derived from bisulfite-converted genomic dna. altogether, the longer reads generated with the flx system greatly facilitated their mapping back to the reference genome sequence. notwithstanding this advantage, however, we anticipate that our approach may be adapted to take advantage of competing next generation sequencing platforms that have a higher throughput and that can now generate sufficiently long sequence reads.

using this strategy a total of  <dig> putative alu elements were identified. we found that  <dig> % of their insertion sites fell within intronic regions, while one integration site mapped to the 3'-utr of the tomm <dig> gene. tomm <dig> is a component of the preprotein translocase complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane, which consists of at least  <dig> different proteins . these results are consistent with previous studies indicating that alu retrotransposons tend to be inserted within intragenic regions  <cit> .

out of the twenty-one insertion events that were randomly selected for validation analysis, nineteen were successfully verified. a limitation of the alu-anchored bisulfite pcr approach that needs to be acknowledged is the fact that only 5' flanking sequences are obtained. the right arm of the alu retrotransposons and their 3' flanking sequences are not represented in the sequence reads that are generated. hence, in order to design primers for the validation experiments, we used the reference sequence of the human genome as source of putative 3'-flanking sequences for the alu insertions. accordingly, it is possible that the two cases that could not be verified may have been caused by the utilization of an incorrect 3' flanking sequence for primer design. notwithstanding this limitation, the lowest estimated accuracy for the analysis pipeline that we have implemented in this study for the identification of de novo alu retrotransposition events would be of  <dig> % .

the sequence features  that are typically observed in newly inserted alu elements constitute hallmarks of retrotransposition  <cit> . indeed, further analysis of the aforementioned nineteen pcr-cloned alu elements and flanking sequences revealed the presence of both the tsd and tt/aaaa sites. alu a-tails seem to be an important factor to enable alu element retrotransposition  <cit> . roy-engel et al. reported that the average a-tail length of active alu elements is  <dig>  <cit> . consistent to their finding, the alu a-tail sizes of the alu elements described in this study ranged from 11- <dig> with an average of  <dig> bp.

most cancer genomes are characterized by localized hypermethylation as well as by global hypomethylation  <cit> . this hypomethylation process may enable transcription and de novo retrotransposition of alu elements which, in turn, may lead to genome instability  <cit> . our previous study demonstrated that the methylation level of alu elements decreased in ependymomas, and most significantly in recurrent tumors  <cit> . to examine whether some alu insertions represented somatic events limited to recurrent ependymomas, which could have occurred in consequence of the loss of dna methylation, we generated and compared pcr products from ten genomic loci in primary and in recurrent tumors derived from one individual. the same results were obtained in all ten genomic loci. in addition, five of the ten alu insertions were also found in other individuals. these results suggested that such validated alu insertions most likely represent germ-line rather than somatic events.

in this study, in addition to identifying structural variants in the genome of  <dig> individuals, we investigated epigenetic variations that might result from de novo retrotransponsition events. the alu elements identified in this study were heavily methylated, as it was previously shown by high-throughput bisulfite sequencing and herein validated by cloning and sequencing analyses. the analysis of methylation throughout the mapped alus and among the  <dig> loci verified revealed that there were no methylation differences among tissues . this result indicates that at least by the time these dna samples were obtained most of the newly inserted alu elements were already transcriptionally repressed. this finding is further supported by the fact that the promoters of the alu elements, i.e. their a and b boxes, were found to be methylated. however, there was one exception. we found an alu insertion that was partially unmethylated . interestingly, the insertion of this alu element occurred  <dig>  bp downstream from a cpg island and  <dig>  bp downstream from the transcription start site of tomm <dig>  a gene encoding the translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane  <dig>  with a completely unmethylated promoter , it is conceivable that this alu element may have remained transcriptionally active and hence have served as source for additional retrotransposition events. another interesting finding was that a cpg island that is upstream of the element - i.e., that of tomm <dig> - may be influencing the methylation pattern of this alu repeat. indeed, the methylation status of the cpg island was similar to that of the 5' end sequences of this alu repeat, i.e. both were unmethylated. it would be interesting to explore the functional impact of this particular alu on the nearby tomm <dig> gene. additionally,  <dig> alu repeats and  <dig> mir element that are localized between the newly inserted alu repeat and the cpg island were found to exhibit very low methylation levels. such striking pattern of dna methylation may indeed be an indication of the influence exerted by the adjacent cpg island. it is also possible that other epigenetic factors might be affecting the methylation statuses of these alu elements, such as nucleosome positioning. two previous studies have reported the influence of nucleosome positioning, within and around alu element, in alu activity  <cit> . accordingly, it is noteworthy that an alujo that is localized downstream of this newly inserted alu exhibits a similar pattern of dna methylation, i.e. its 5' half is unmethylated while its 3' half is methylated. in our previous study  <cit> , we found that genomic localization has a profound impact on alu methylation status. in this study, the identification of both methylated and unmethylated alu elements provided additional support to there being a positional effect on alu methylation. last, but not least, it is noteworthy that two of the novel alu insertions herein reported map within or near genes encoding members of the preprotein translocase complex of the outer mitochondrial membrane, namely tomm <dig> and tomm <dig>  respectively. it is conceivable that given their housekeeping function and ubiquitous expression pattern, hence commonly open chromatin status, these genes may be more vulnerable to uptake de novo retrotransposition events.

to explore the epigenetic impact of alu insertion on adjacent genomic sequences, we examined the methylation statuses for two loci harboring hemizygous insertions, and - in one case - obtained the methylation patterns of cpg dinucleotides flanking the alu insertion sites. both alleles - irrespective of the presence of an inserted element - were found to be heavily methylated, and no significant epigenetic variation was observed in association with the presence of the additional alu element.

CONCLUSIONS
in this work we have identified a few novel alu insertions sites. we used dna samples from normal and from tumor tissues, but the data obtained did not show any tissue preference for these insertions. more studies are highly desired to further scrutinize the functional aspects of structural variants in the human genome, including epigenetic variations that might arise in consequence of a de novo retrotransposition event.
