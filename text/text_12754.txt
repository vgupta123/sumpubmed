BACKGROUND
in the past two decades the use of noninvasive techniques to study the human brain has become pervasive. data gathered from studies using positron emission tomography  and functional magnetic resonance imaging  have enhanced our knowledge of normal processing in the cerebral cortex, as well as deficits related to disease states. while these techniques are widely used to study aspects of brain organization and function, there are limitations regarding their use and the types of information that can be obtained. in particular, the poor temporal resolution of these two techniques limits studies primarily to the spatial domain.

a less widely used technique, magnetoencephalography , is a non-invasive method for detecting and characterizing changes in neuromagnetic fields in the brain. meg has the advantage that it directly measures neuronal activity rather than a blood oxygenation based signal, an indirect measure of brain function that forms the basis of fmri and pet measurements. meg, therefore, has higher temporal resolution  with reasonable spatial resolution for cortical activity   <cit> . since its introduction by cohen in  <dig>  <cit> , meg has proven useful for clinical applications and basic science research  <cit> .

despite its increasing popularity, the neurophysiological basis of the meg signal is still not well established. based on early in vitro electrophysiological studies in turtle cerebellar preparations  <cit> , guinea pig hippocampal preparations  <cit>  and a series of in vivo studies in rats  <cit> , it has been hypothesized that the genesis of the signal is synchronous cellular currents emanating from parallel apical pyramidal dendrites  <cit> . several computer modeling studies support this proposition  <cit> . it has also been proposed that weak, high-frequency magnetic responses observed in somatosensory cortex in humans  <cit>  and piglets  <cit>  may be related to action potential activity, though there is no direct electropysiological data to support this hypothesis. further, there are limitations to the existing previous work.in vitro tissue preparations are limited because much of the cortical functional connectivity is lost and natural stimuli can not be used. in addition, previous animal studies using small numbers of gradiometer coils  to collect magnetic signals provide poor spatial resolution and make source localization challenging.

the bulk of existing data is based on studies using electrical stimuli  <cit>  or penicillin-induced focal epilepsy . these highly specialized stimulus conditions may not accurately reflect the relationship between meg and the neural response under normal stimulus conditions. further, the relationship between the meg signal and the underlying neural response to complex natural stimuli has not been extensively investigated.

our goal was to examine the relationship between the meg signal and underlying neural activity in primary somatosensory cortex  in macaque monkeys using a complex natural stimulus consiting of varying rates of cutaneous stimulation. we used controlled mechanical stimuli administered at three different rates and directly compared the meg response to two robust measures of neural activity, local field potentials , and multi-unit activity  in the same animals. we used varying rates of stimulation as a complex stimulus because the strength of the meg and somatosensory evoked potential  response has been shown to decrease with increasing rate of tactile stimulation in human somatosensory cortex  <cit> . in addition, spiking activity in rat somatosensory cortex also shows a rate dependent effect  <cit> . we hypothesize that the meg signal will faithfully reflect latency and amplitude characteristics of the underlying neural rate effect. quantifying the reliability and validity of the meg signal is crucial for interpreting existing meg data, designing future experiments, and more fully appreciating cortical temporal processing.

RESULTS
in the present investigation, we examined the relationship between the meg signal, local field potentials and multiunit activity in the same animal using calibrated mechanical stimuli delivered at varying rates of stimulation. as suggested in previous studies, the amplitude of the response was inversely related to the rate of stimulation for all three measures. the major findings in the present investigation were that 1) the relative amplitude of the meg signal accurately reflected stimulus induced changes in underlying neural activity, however the amplitude of the meg response was more closely correlated to the amplitude of the lfp than the mua response; and 2) the response latencies of the lfp and meg recordings were similar, while both were significantly different from the response latency of the mua data.

magnetoencephalography
a total of eleven sets of meg data containing all three stimulation rates were collected from both hemispheres in each of two monkeys. tactile stimuli simultaneously delivered to the index finger and thumb consistently evoked a significant change in the magnetic field relative to a prestimulus baseline at all three stimulation conditions in contralateral parietal cortex, but the amplitudes of the evoked responses were different at individual isis. figure  <dig> shows an example recorded from one subject's left hemisphere.

the dominant waveform was a single large amplitude peak at about  <dig> msec. a similar large amplitude peak has been observed at around  <dig> ms in humans , which we assume corresponds to the large amplitude peak we measured in the monkey. other peaks were also observed, but they were not consistently present. in four cases a small peak was seen prior to the large peak described above. a less consistent earlier small peak occurring around  <dig> ms has been evoked in humans using electrical stimulation  and using cutaneous stimulation . this peak may correspond to the earliest small peak observed in the monkey data. the responses after the large peak were variable, and were not always present, which is also common in human data  <cit> . in this study, we focused on the consistent large peak, which is the most reliable and repeatable response. the dipole fit localized the source of this early peak response to the central sulcus . all dipole sources were located within  <dig> cm of the electrophysiological recording sites in the digit representation of 3b.

the average response amplitude for all datasets from four hemispheres decreased with increasing stimulation rate as in the example shown in figure  <dig>  for the slow stimulation rate , the grand average response magnitude  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ft. the average magnitude of the response  was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ft with an isi of 1s and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ft with the  <dig> s isi. the grand average moment response values  were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig>   for 2s, 1s and  <dig> s isis, respectively. for 1s and  <dig> s isis, the grand average moment response values were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % relative to the average moment response value at the 2s isi. the amplitude of the response was significantly different for the three rates . the relative intensity changes are shown in figure  <dig> 

the average latency of the first large response peak for all datasets from the four hemispheres was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms at 2s, 1s and  <dig> s isi respectively. for all stimulation rates, the first peak occurred at a mean of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms. the response latencies were not significantly different for the three rates . all dipoles of the early large response were located in the central sulcus of the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated hand.

electrophysiological measures
lfp and mua data were recorded from the contralateral distal d <dig> and d <dig> representations in area 3b at twenty-eight sites from three hemispheres. the neurons recorded at these sites had clearly defined receptive fields on contralateral distal d <dig> or d <dig>  histological analysis indicated that all sites were within the caudal bank of the cs, approximately in layer  <dig> . at each recording site, lfp and mua data were measured simultaneously. a representative example from a single recording site is shown in figure  <dig>  lfp activity was averaged over  <dig> trials  and mua spikes were displayed as single trial rasters  and psths .

the lfp waveform consisted of an initial, large, negative peak followed by a smaller positive peak. similar waveforms have previously been recorded from layer  <dig> of monkey  <cit>  and rat  <cit>  somatosensory cortex. as with the meg data, the amplitude of the lfp was also dependent on isi, with the longest isi resulting in the largest response amplitude . the average lfp magnitudes were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mv for  <dig> s, 1s and 2s isis respectively. for 1s and  <dig> s isis, the average magnitudes were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % relative to the average magnitude at the 2s isi.

in the example illustrated in figure  <dig>  little or no spontaneous activity was observed. stimulus evoked mua activity occurred with a latency of  <dig> ms post stimulus onset . the duration of activity was brief in that there was an initial burst of activity  <dig> ms after stimulus onset, and then a rapid cessation of activity a few milliseconds later. as with the other metrics studied, there was a clear dependence of the magnitude of the response on isi, with the greatest response at the 2s isi and the weakest response for the  <dig> s isi . the average spike counts within  <dig> ms after the onset of the stimulus over the  <dig> trials were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  for  <dig> s, 1s and 2s isis respectively. for 1s and  <dig> s isis, the average spike counts were  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % relative to the average magnitude at the 2s isi.

comparison between meg, lfp and mua
the qualitative impressions from these data are that all three metrics show the highest activity at the longest isi and the least activity at the shortest isi. in order to quantify this assessment across the  <dig> recording sites, we computed the average meg, lfp and mua amplitudes. the early main peak amplitudes of the average lfp curves and the dipole moments  based on the early meg response peaks were used for comparison. for the mua data, the total spike count within  <dig> ms after the onset of the stimulus was used to evaluate the intensity of the mua for all recording sites. in order to compare the three metrics , the response amplitudes at the  <dig> s and 1s isi were normalized to the response amplitude at the 2s isi. these data are shown in figure  <dig>  the normalized amplitudes were significantly different across both isi and measurement method . post-hoc tests indicated that mua amplitude was significantly lower than lfp  and meg  signal amplitude, while lfp and meg results were not significantly different from each other .

the correlation between metrics was evaluated using regression analysis. the coefficient of determination  from each hemisphere is listed in the table  <dig>  the r <dig> values show the greatest correlation between the meg and lfp signal , while the meg and mua data are not as highly correlated . a scatter plot  using normalized data shows the pooled data from all hemispheres. the slope in the meg/lfp comparison  is greater than the meg/mua comparison . these results indicate that meg and lfp signals are more strongly correlated than the meg and mua signals.

a pairwise regression analysis was used to evaluate the correlation between meg and lfp/mua. regression parameters were computed between measurement methods in each hemisphere individually .

latency
response peak latency did not significantly change with the rate of stimulation for mua, lfp or meg measures . however, response latency was significantly different across measurement modalities . the latency of the response was longest for the meg signal, shorter for the lfp signal and shortest for the mua signal .

as described in the methods section, the cut off frequency of the filter could have introduced a phase delay. the maximum time delay for lfp and meg data introduced by phase shifting was up to  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms respectively. taking this delay into account, the mean adjusted latencies  of the lfp and meg peaks at each isi were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms respectively, while the mean peak response latency of the mua data was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  ms . the mean adjusted latencies were significantly different across measurement modalities , but not across isis. post-hoc tests indicated that the adjusted latencies were significantly longer for meg than for lfp data , and both meg and lfp latencies were significantly longer than the latency of the mua burst . the latency difference between the meg and lfp data was much smaller than the latency difference between the meg and mua data. therefore, as with measures of amplitude, the meg data more closely reflected the lfp rather than the mua response.

discussion
in this study, we used meg to record magnetic field changes as a function of stimulation rate. for comparison we made lfp and mua recordings from the same monkeys using identical stimuli. our results demonstrate that the meg signal faithfully reflects underlying neural activity. in addition, the meg signal correlates more closely to lfp than mua data in both amplitude and latency.

signal amplitude changes corresponding to varying stimulation rates
the relative response amplitude decreased in meg, lfp and mua signals with increasing stimulation rate, which is consistent with previous studies of human seps  <cit> , human sefs  <cit> , rat seps  <cit>  and rat electrophysiological recordings  <cit> . because increasing stimulation rate reduced both amplitude of magnetic field and spike number in guinea pig hippocampal preparations, it has been suggested that the rate effect may be due to an increase of tonic inhibition at high stimulation rates  <cit> .

the three methods used in our study showed a similar inverse relationship between stimulus rate and response magnitude, but to different degrees. mua data showed the most pronounced rate effect, while lfp and meg rate effect changes were not as pronounced. we also showed a stronger correlation between meg and lfp than meg and mua signal amplitude changes across isis. thus the meg response more closely reflected the lfp rather than the mua signal. local field potentials are low-pass filtered electrophysiological signals that are generally considered to be the summed synaptic activity reflecting the slow component extracted from the neural response . the fact that the relative amplitude decreased more in mua than in lfp and meg signals at low isis agrees with the linear property of post-synaptic activity and the nonlinearity of mua which relies on the number of neurons involved and their threshold levels. these results directly demonstrate that meg signal amplitude fluctuations are highly correlated with lfp rather than mua amplitude fluctuations. moreover, because of the similarities between the macaque monkey model and human cortex, our findings support the proposal that the human meg signal reflects mainly post-synaptic activity  <cit> , and meg studies should be designed and interpreted in light of the fact that this signal does not appear to represent spike activity.

latency across measurement techniques
in the present investigation, the mean mua peak burst latency was  <dig>  ms, while the mean adjusted latency of the lfp and meg signals were  <dig>  ms and  <dig>  ms, respectively. the lfp latencies observed in our study are consistent with those observed previously in layer  <dig> of rat  <cit>  and monkey  <cit>  somatosensory cortex. the first peak latency of electrical-stimuli-evoked seps recorded from the postcentral gyrus of anesthetized monkeys, which is around  <dig> ms, is slightly shorter than the adjusted latency of the first main lfp peak from our study of natural stimuli  <cit> . in contrast, the peak latency of the mua bursts was  <dig>  ms earlier than the adjusted peak latency of the lfp. the time delay of the lfp signal in our study was similar to that reported by murthy and fetz  <cit> , who showed that electrical-stimuli-evoked multi-unit discharges occurred with the highest probability at about  <dig>  ms earlier than the lfp peak in sensorimotor cortex of awake monkeys. a slightly longer  delay between mua and lfp has also been reported in rat somatosensory cortex  <cit> .

previous studies have also demonstrated that the lfp signal not only has a slower onset, but can last up to tens of milliseconds compared to the action potential, which has a rapid onset and a short duration of about  <dig> millisecond  <cit> . there are several reasons why both lfp latency and length of response are longer than that of the mua signal. first, both synaptic activity and other intrinsic dynamics such as membrane afterpotentials appear to contribute to the lfp  <cit> , while only fast membrane potential change contributes to the mua signal. second, the extent of spatial summation of the lfp  is much wider than that of the mua signal   <cit> . meg recordings presumably reflect summed signals from all local active neurons, which is likely much larger than the spatial extent of the lfp signal observed with a single electrode. this difference in spatial summation could account for the longer peak latency for the meg vs. lfp and mua data.

further, the shorter peak latency of mua may also be due to the cessation of neural activity caused by the poststimulus ipsps from inhibitory interneurons, which underlie the in-field inhibition observed in monkey sep studies  <cit> . for example, previous work shows that most spike activity terminated slightly before the early sep component evoked using an airpuff stimulus  <cit> . the excitation of inhibitory interneurons may also contribute to population metrics like lfp and meg signals, and make their peak latencies longer than mua's.

it is also possible that the latency differences between meg, lfp and spiking activity are due to differential laminar sensitivity of the measures. generally the thalamic afferent signals arrive at the cortical granular layer first , are relayed to supragranular layers, and then to infragranular layers . both epsp latency  <cit>  and bold mri onset time  <cit>  are shorter in layer  <dig> than in other layers. action potentials recorded from rat somatosensory cortex showed that there was a delay of  <dig>  ms and  <dig> ms from layer  <dig> to layer  <dig> and layer 5a/ <dig>  respectively  <cit> . a slightly shorter delay in spike latency from layer  <dig> to layer 2/ <dig> , and to layer 5a  has also been reported in rats  <cit> .

in the present study we recorded lfp and mua data primarily in cortical layer  <dig>  in which neurons have small receptive fields  <cit>  and have robust responses  <cit> , compared to neurons from other cortical layers. however, the stellate cells  lack an apical dendrite  <cit> , and the current dipoles originating from layer  <dig> stellate cells are much weaker than those from layer 2/ <dig> and  <dig> pyramidal cells  <cit> . for these reasons the meg signal is unlikely to originate from layer  <dig>  it is known that meg is primarily sensitive to the magnetic fields produced by currents tangential to the brain surface, and the synaptic currents along the apical dendrite trunks of large pyramidal cells located within the sulci are thought to be the primary source of the meg signal  <cit> , thus we can infer that the latency of our meg signal is derived from pyramidal cells in layers 2/ <dig> and  <dig> .

the slightly longer meg latency may also be due to the spatial resolution limitations of meg. as discussed above, meg detects all currents tangential to the brain surface, in the central sulcus, somatosensory evoked signals primarily originate from area 3b , but may be generated in the adjacent areas 3a and  <dig>  therefore, the longer meg latency may reflect the sum of signals from several adjacent areas with different latencies.

finally, the stimulation rate-dependent amplitude decrease was greater for the mua than lfp and meg signals. this difference suggests that mua, which measures the neural activity primarily in layer  <dig>  is temporally coupled to stimulus rate, and that these neurons have a stronger response to rate change. on the other hand, lfp and meg signals, which measure activity from other cortical layers, may reflect local cortical computations, and show a reduced response to change of stimulation rate. taken together, the data suggest that the  <dig>  ms delay of the adjusted meg signal compared with the mua signal roughly corresponds to the relay time from layer  <dig> to infragranular layers.

does meg faithfully reflect neural responses to complex stimuli?
we have shown that meg is an excellent tool for the in vivo study of neural activity in response to temporally complex stimuli. in particular, we observed a linear relationship between meg and lfp data, with a decrease in response amplitude of approximately  <dig> and 50% for the 1s and  <dig> s isis relative to the average magnitude at the 2s isi. in contrast, the relationship between the blood oxygenation level dependent  response and lfp and mua data is more necessarily complex reflecting the interaction of local metabolism, blood oxygenation, volume, flow and intravascular magnetic susceptability. in fact, there is evidence that the relationship between the bold signal and various measures of neural activity at higher visual and tactile stimulation frequencies is not entirely linear  <cit> .

we also examined latency differences across measurement techniques, but these discrepancies were relatively small . these differences are an order of magnitude smaller than the temporal resolution of the bold response, which is known to be around 4– <dig> seconds  <cit> . while efforts have been made to deconvolve the hemodynamic response , bold signals are significantly delayed relative to underly neural activity. in contrast, we have now shown that the meg signal faithfully represents the temporal dynamics of underlying electrophysiological activity. thus, meg is a superior non-invasive imaging technique for studies involving stimuli that vary over short time scales.

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the relationship between somatosensory evoked meg, lfp and mua signals recorded from the macaque monkey primary somatosensory cortex was investigated. we found that the amplitude of the response was inversely related to the stimulation rate, but to different degrees for the three techniques. the amplitude decrease at high rates of stimulation was significantly greater for mua than lfp and meg data. the latency of response was longest for the meg signal and shortest for the mua signal. based on the correlation of intensity and latency between meg and lfp signals, we conclude that the meg signal reflects primarily synaptic currents rather than spiking activity. because the meg signal faithfully reflects complex stimulus properties, this non-invasive means of measurement is not only complementary to, but may also replace some invasive modalities, such as intracranial electrode recording. meg can also help to bridge the gap between basic science research carried out in animals and human clinical and neuroscience findings.
