BACKGROUND
the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  is a ligand-gated ion channel  that mediates fast synaptic cholinergic transmission in the insect central nervous system  <cit> . a nachr is formed by five subunits arranged around a central pore that is permeable to cations  <cit> . these subunits are encoded by multiple α- and β subunit genes. diverse nachrs, differing in subunit composition, have different electrophysiological and pharmacological profiles  <cit> . agonists, such as acetylcholine, bind to the n-terminal extracellular domain of the subunits at a site formed by six loops  located at subunit interfaces. the n-terminal extracellular domain also contains a cys-loop, characteristic of cys-loop lgics, which consists of two disulphide-bond forming cysteines separated by  <dig> residues  <cit> . each subunit also has four transmembrane regions . the subunits with two vicinal cys at loop c which are involved in acetylcholine binding are classified into α type, whereas other subunits lacking the two cys residues are regarded as non-α type  <cit> . phosphorylation sites are found in a long intracellular loop between tm <dig> and tm <dig>  which may modulate the receptor activity  <cit> .

the genomes of drosophila melanogaster, anopheles gambiae, apis mellifera have been completely sequenced and their nachr gene families have been annotated. d. melanogaster has seven α and three β subunits  <cit> , a. gambiae has nine α and one β  <cit> , and a. mellifera possesses nine α and two β  <cit> . mammals and chicken have  <dig> and  <dig> nachr subunits respectively  <cit> . compared with vertebrates, insects seem to have a small nachr gene family. however, recent studies showed that insects may enhance the functional diversity through alternative splicing of exons and rna editing of transcripts  <cit> . in drosophila, alternative splicing leads to the loss of some exons or retention of introns in mature nachr mrna  <cit> .

although study of insect nachrs is still at an early stage, researchers have exploited nachr as an insecticide target for a long time  <cit> . to defend against insects and other herbivores, plants synthesize compounds having insecticidal activities. nicotine extracted from tobacco, for example, has been used as a commercial insecticide extensively, which is a potent agonist of nachr  <cit> . neonicotinoids are a group of insecticides, including imidacloprid, thiamethoxam  <cit> . these insecticides exhibit low effective dosage, selective toxicity for insects over vertebrates, wide insecticidal activity, and excellent uptake in plants  <cit> . since the first neonicotinoid insecticide imidacloprid was put into market, it has gained the fastest growing sales of any insecticide worldwide  <cit> .

the silkworm, bombyx mori, producing silk, is an important beneficial insect in many countries. recently this insect gained more attention because the silkworm bodies can express foreign proteins after being infected with recombinant baculovirus  <cit> . b. mori is also a good model organism because of its large body size, ease of rearing  <cit> , and the completion of the whole genome sequence  <cit> . b. mori belongs to lepidoptera, the second largest order of insecta, possessing about  <dig> thousand species. most insects of this order are herbivores and eat plants at the larval stage and many are agricultural pests except for the silkworm. up to date, five α and one β subunits from heliothis virescens, one α and one β from manduca sexta, one α from chilo suppressalis and one β subunit from spodoptera exigua are deposited in genbank. in addition, three alternative transcripts of b. mori α <dig> were reported  <cit> . despite the agricultural importance of lepidopteran insects, the nachr subunit gene family from this order remains unclear. in this report, we report the molecular characterization of the nachr gene family from the silkworm.

RESULTS
twelve candidate nachr subunit genes in the b. mori genome
we searched the b. mori genome sequence database for nachr subunit genes by tblastn  <cit> . twelve candidate genes were identified. through rt-pcr and race analyses, expression of all  <dig> nachr subunit genes was confirmed and complete open reading frames  were obtained except bmα <dig>  a  <dig> bp sequence encoding the signal peptide at the n-terminus of bmα <dig> was obtained from an est sequence  by blast search  <cit>  and the complete orf of bmα <dig> was then assembled. alignment of predicted protein sequences  shows that all these subunits possess two cys separated by  <dig> residues, typical of lgic subunits, as well as six conserved loops  located at the n-terminal domain. nine of them, having two vicinal cys at loop c, belong to type α, whereas the other three lack this motif and are therefore of type β. all subunits carry a predicted signal peptide at the n-terminus, and all but one  possess four transmembrane motifs  at the c-terminal domain, which are involved in forming an ion channel. bmα <dig> has only three transmembrane regions . loops between tm <dig> and tm <dig> were highly variable and have predicted phosphorylation sites. putative n-glycosylation sites are present in the n-terminal extracellular domains of all nachr subunits  <cit> .

most b. mori nachrs show high levels of sequence identities with the counterparts of d. melanogaster, up to 86% . however, bmα <dig> shares a low sequence identity with d. melanogaster α <dig>  although it shows the 48% amino acid identity with a. mellifera α <dig>  we constructed a phylogenetic tree comprising  <dig> insect nachr subunit protein sequences . in fruit fly, mosquito and honeybee, nachr subunits α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  and β <dig> have strong corresponding relationships. silkworm also has counterparts of these subunits, which are consequently named according to the existing nomenclature. however, subunits bmα <dig> and bmα <dig> are difficult to identify. in a. mellifera, α <dig> was named because its n-terminal domain shared more identity with d. melanogaster α <dig> and another was named α <dig>  <cit> . we named b. mori α <dig> and α <dig> following the nomenclature of a. mellifera because they had strong corresponding relationships. d. melanogaster β <dig> and a. gambiae α <dig> had low amino acid identities with other gene family members. recently, a. mellifera β <dig> and α <dig> were also found having low sequence identities with other members of the nachr family, and the two genes are located closely in the genome at a distance of  <dig> kb. it was suggested that the two genes arose from a recent evolutionary duplication event  <cit> . as shown in table  <dig>  three b. mori subunits, bmα <dig>  bmβ <dig>  and bmβ <dig>  have low sequence similarities with other nachr subunits. phylogenetic analysis indicates that bmβ <dig> and bmβ <dig> are clustered into one branch, suggesting that bmα <dig> had diverged before the two β subunits separated evolutionarily. bmα <dig> shows 27% sequence identity with a. mellifera α <dig> and 21% with a. gambiae α <dig>  respectively. bmβ <dig> and bmβ <dig> show equal sequence identities with a. mellifera β <dig>  17%.

gene structure
alternative splicing
drosophila nachr subunit α <dig> has two alternative forms differing in residues near the cys-loop; the α <dig> subunit with exon 4' displays a less efficient assembling ability than that with exon  <dig>  <cit> . silkworm α <dig> also has these two alternative exons . jin et al  cloned b. mori α <dig> and reported that the exons  <dig> and  <dig> of this subunit each possess two alternative forms  <cit> . b. mori α <dig> could have exon 3a, exon 3b or both in tandem. we found a transcript of bmα <dig> missing both exons 3a and 3b . alternative splicing of silkworm nachrs not only occurs in α <dig> and α <dig>  but also in α <dig>  silkworm α <dig> has two alternative exon 7s, located at tm <dig> and tm <dig> . two alternative exon 4s of α <dig> are found in drosophila, apis, anopheles, and bombyx. it has been postulated that these alternative exons have arisen from a very ancient duplication event before the evolutionary divergence of those insects. however, we found that the two alternative exon 7s in α <dig> are extremely similar , indicating a more recent duplication event. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using protein sequences corresponding to the exon 7s from several insects, showing that duplication of exon 7s appeared before the divergence of two lepidopteran insects, after the divergence of apis and bombyx, and at the same time with the divergence of bombyx from two dipteran insects .

truncated transcripts
existence of nachr transcripts lacking some exons or retaining some introns has been reported in many insects as well as in vertebrates  <cit> . it was supposed that the translation products of these transcripts may function as acetylcholine "sponge" like molluscan ach-binding protein  <cit>  or change physiological properties by interfering with the function of normal subunits  <cit> . in our experiments, truncated transcripts of bmα <dig> and bmα <dig> were identified . bmα4Δ <dig> , <dig> lacks exons 6– <dig> which includes loop f and tm1– <dig>  bmα5Δ <dig> lacks exon  <dig>  which introduces a premature stop codon because of a frame shift and only a very short open reading frame is retained. d. melanogaster α <dig> and α <dig> also had truncated transcripts, but they lack different exons  <cit> .

rna editing
four d. melanogaster nachr subunits, α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig>  β <dig>  were found having rna editing sites. their b. mori counterparts, α <dig>  α <dig>  α <dig>  β <dig>  were examined for rna editing sites in our experiments. cdna clones from separate rt-pcrs and the corresponding regions of genomic dna were sequenced and compared. while the genomic dna sequences were same as those in the silkworm genome sequence database  <cit> , five bases of α <dig>  in the cdna sequence were different from genome dna sequence, likely resulting from rna editing. these nucleotide changes result in altered residues of n131s, n132g, i149m, and t152a. possible rna editing was also found in three transcript variants of the b. mori α <dig> gene  <cit> . no rna editing sites were found in other three subunit genes examined.

discussion
with the help of the silkworm genome sequence and by rt-pcr and race, we identified the first nachr subunit gene family in a lepidopteran insect, and the fourth insect nachr gene family, following d. melanogaster, a. gambiae, and a. mellifera. with  <dig> members, the nachr gene family of b. mori is the most complex one among those reported for insects. bmα1– <dig> and β <dig> are more similar to the counterparts of other insects compared with the other three subunits, α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig>  the phylogenetic relationship of the three subunits indicated that they might have arisen from two separate evolutionary duplication events. the first event likely took place after bombyx had diverged from drosophila and anopheles, and the second might occur after bombyx had diverged from apis.

the gek motif preceding tm <dig> is conserved in most insect nachr subunits, and the glutamate residue is considered to be associated with cation selectivity  <cit> . sequence comparison results show that most of the b. mori nachr subunits contained a gek motif preceding tm <dig> , while the motif was replaced by str in α <dig> and β <dig>  and by tir in β <dig>  we calculated the amino acid identities of these three subunits with anion channel subunits including d. melanogaster gabar, rdl , glutamate-gated chloride channel , histamate-gated chloride channel , and vertebrate serotonin receptor . b. mori α <dig> shares 10–17% identities with those anion channel subunits, while it shares 27% identity with apis nachr α <dig>  bombyx β <dig>  β <dig> share 8–12% identities with above anion channel subunits, they show 17% identities with a. mellifera β <dig>  these results show that bombyx α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> are likely nachr subunit candidates as opposed to being other members of the cys-loop lgic superfamily. whether bombyx α <dig>  β <dig> and β <dig> possess the cation selectivity as other gek-motif-containing achr subunits remains to be determined.

it is an unusual finding that b. mori α <dig> only has three transmembrane regions, lacking tm <dig>  our 3' race result showed the α <dig> mrna contained a consensus polyadenylation signal  located  <dig> bp upstream of the poly tail. according to the 3'-terminal sequence, we designed gene specific primers and performed additional rt-pcr, but failed to find any longer cdna product that would include tm <dig> or another distinct region. these results suggest that b. mori α <dig> contains only three transmembrane regions.

alternative splicing of several exons results in changes of residues belonging to loops d, e, cys-loop, tm <dig>  and tm <dig>  the truncated transcripts lack exons that contain sequences for ligand binding or the ion channel pore. we also detected possible rna editing events in nachr genes. it was reported that rna editing might change during insect development  <cit> , so additional editing sites might exist in α <dig> or other subunits.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show the silkworm contains the largest insect nachr gene family characterized to date, including nine α-type subunits and three β-type subunits. rna-editing, alternative splicing and truncated transcripts were found in several subunit genes, which might further enhance the diversity of the gene family. these results provide a foundation for future characterization of possibly tissue-specific and developmental expression patterns and the physiological functions of lepidopteran nachr receptors. furthermore, the comparison of the nachr gene family of bombyx with those of other insects, in particular lepidoptera, may serve as an important basis for developing improved insecticides that spare an economically important insect while controlling major agricultural pests.
