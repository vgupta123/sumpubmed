BACKGROUND
the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals is inhabitated by a specialized microbiota, but our understanding of the composition and the dynamics of this intestinal ecosystem is very rudimentary. recent molecular methodologies, typically based on amplification and identification of 16s ribosomal rna genes, have revealed highly complex and diverse bacterial, fungal, and viral communities within the intestinal tract of mammals  <cit> .

the composition of the intestinal microbial ecosystem has a significant impact on the health status of an individual. the intestinal microbiota are a key player in the development of the host immune system, provide trophic metabolites and energy to the host, and also aid in the resistance against colonization of pathogens  <cit> . at the same time, derangements of the intestinal microbiota or the invasion with specific pathogens have been implicated as a cause for gastrointestinal disease  <cit> .

nutritional or medical intervention, especially the use of antimicrobials can lead to general alterations in intestinal microbiota  <cit> . tylosin, a member of the macrolide class of antibiotics, is commonly recommended for the treatment of chronic enteropathies in dogs. it is currently unknown if tylosin at therapeutic doses has a direct effect on intestinal pathogens or if it leads to a more general modulation of the intestinal microbiota in dogs with diarrhea, with a subsequent improvement of intestinal digestion and absorption. for example, some known gastrointestinal pathogens, including clostridium perfringens and campylobacter spp., are known to play a role in the etiopathogenesis of chronic or intermittent diarrhea in dogs, and these bacteria are generally sensitive to tylosin  <cit> . tylosin is also a commonly used antibiotic for the treatment of canine small intestinal bacterial overgrowth  or antibiotic responsive diarrhea   <cit> . recently the term tylosin-responsive diarrhea has been introduced, because tylosin treatment led to the best therapeutic response in a subpopulation of dogs with chronic diarrhea  <cit> . tylosin-responsive diarrhea  affects typically middle-aged, large-breed dogs and clinical signs indicate that trd affects both the small and large intestine. the etiology of trd is currently unknown. diarrhea usually improves within a few days, but often recurs within a few weeks after cessation of tylosin administration and the majority of dogs require lifelong therapy  <cit> . however, in addition to its antimicrobial effect, a direct anti-inflammatory effect of tylosin has also been proposed. this anti-inflammatory effect has been speculated to be due to the modulation of cyclooxygenase- <dig>  nitric oxidase synthase, and several cytokines  <cit> . in mice and rhesus macaques with colitis, tylosin has also been shown to reduce macroscopic lesion scores, and either a direct immunomodulatory effect or an indirect effect due to the modulation of the microbiota has been suggested  <cit> .

antibiotic activity has a profound effect on the intestinal microbiota  <cit> , and it is important to characterize changes in bacterial diversity, their magnitude and the resilience of the intestinal microbiota against antibiotic-related modifications. such an understanding could potentially lead to the development of alternative treatment modalities that would allow therapeutic options other than the use of antimicrobials. while recent studies have shown that the fecal microbiota is generally resilient to short-term antibiotic administration, some bacterial taxa may remain depressed for several months  <cit> . limited information concerning the effect of antimicrobials on small intestinal microbiota, an important contributor to gastrointestinal health, is available. previous studies have examined the effect of tylosin on intestinal microbiota in pigs and chickens using culture based methods or molecular fingerprinting tools, but detailed sequencing data have not been provided  <cit> . therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of tylosin on the jejunal microbiota by massive parallel 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing.

in this study we administered tylosin at therapeutic doses to healthy dogs with a pre-existing jejunal fistula and analyzed changes in bacterial communities before, during, and  <dig> days after cessation of tylosin by 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing. our results indicate a previously uncharacterized high species richness in the canine jejunum. tylosin had a profound effect on the microbial composition in the small intestine of dogs. furthermore, tylosin had also a pervasive effect on specific bacterial taxa, which failed to recover within  <dig> days. however, these changes were not associated with any short-term clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease in healthy dogs. our results illustrate the complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the challenges associated with evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and their potential interactions. the results also suggest that the proposed mode of action of an antibiotic on different bacterial genera does not necessarily match the in vivo effects, as several bacterial groups that are considered to be sensitive to tylosin increased in their proportions.

RESULTS
animals
all dogs tolerated the course of antibiotics well and no obvious side effects  were noted during the study period. the body weights or body condition scores of the dogs did not change during the study.

characterization of the canine small intestinal microbiota
a total of  <dig>  pyrosequencing tags were evaluated across all  <dig> samples . all dogs showed highly diverse microbial communities within their small intestine. table  <dig> lists the mean number of obtained and maximum predicted otus and richness estimators at strain , species , and genus  level  <cit> . at day  <dig> and at 3% dissimilarity, which is commonly used to describe the species level  <cit> , a range of 25- <dig> otus  was observed, indicating strong inter-individual differences in microbial diversity in the canine jejunum. the chao  <dig> and ace richness estimators were used to estimate the total number of otus in the canine jejunum. on day  <dig> and at 3% dissimilarity, the chao  <dig> estimated between  <dig> and  <dig> otus  per sample, and the ace estimated between  <dig> and  <dig> otus  per sample. to estimate the maximum number of otus at various dissimilarities, a richards equation was fit to the obtained rarefaction curves  <cit> . table  <dig> shows the mean number of maximum predicted otus in the canine jejunum: on day  <dig>  and at 3% dissimilarity , the maximum predicted number of otus ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> . at 1% dissimilarity , a mean of  <dig> otus  was predicted. figure  <dig> illustrates that with the average number of sequencing tags collected per dog in this study , we underestimated the maximum number of otus at 1% dissimilarity. however, at 3% and 5% dissimilarity the rarefaction curves approximate a parallel line to the x-axis, suggesting that a reasonable coverage was obtained at the species and genus level. using the richard's equation we calculated that approximately  <dig>  sequences would need to be sampled to identify 100% of the expected otus in the canine jejunum . to obtain a complete coverage at 0% dissimilarity, approx.  <dig>  sequences would need to be analyzed .

this table shows the shannon-weaver bacterial diversity index, observed operative taxonomical units , the predicted maximum number of otus in the canine jejunum, rarefaction, and species richness estimators  at strain , species , and genus  level across the three sampling periods. tylosin administration led to a progressive decrease in mean indices, which were lowest on day  <dig> . however, a strong individual variation was observed among all dogs .

on day  <dig>  ten different bacterial phyla were identified. the major bacterial phyla were proteobacteria , firmicutes , actinobacteria , spirochaetes , bacteroidetes , and fusobacteria . the phyla tenericutes, verrucomicrobia, cyanobacteria, and chloroflexi accounted for <  <dig> % of all obtained sequencing tags each .

effect of tylosin on diversity indices and species richness estimators
while tylosin administration led to a progressive decrease in mean bacterial diversity and species richness estimators over the three sampling periods , this effect was not consistent for all dogs. in fact, on day  <dig>  the shannon-weaver diversity index increased moderately in  <dig> dogs and markedly in  <dig> dog . similar results were obtained for otus and the chao  <dig> and ace estimators. on day  <dig> , the diversity indices and richness estimators were markedly decreased in  <dig> out of  <dig> dogs when compared to baseline.

effect of tylosin on small intestinal microbial communities
results of the unifrac distance metric indicated that tylosin led to a significant shift in microbial populations . microbial communities tended to form a cluster during tylosin treatment . a pca plot was generated using the unweighted unifrac distance metric, which takes into account the presence or absence of different taxa without regard to their abundance . tylosin associated samples  were separated from the non tylosin associated samples mostly along pca axis  <dig> . on day  <dig>  the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day  <dig> in only  <dig> of  <dig> dogs . bacterial diversity as measured by the shannon-weaver diversity index resembled the pre-treatment state in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs . several bacterial groups changed in their proportions in response to tylosin, but a high inter-individual response was observed for various bacterial taxa. proportions of spirochaetes, fusobacteria, bacteroidales, moraxella, and bacilli tended to decrease during tylosin administration.

spirochaetes
spirochaetes were found in all  <dig> dogs at baseline . on day  <dig>  sequences of spirochaetes were found in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs, with a reduction of the mean to  <dig> % . this bacterial phylum was found on day  <dig> only in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs . in the dog with the highest proportion of sequences belonging to spirochaetes at baseline , no such sequences were identified on days  <dig> or  <dig> 

fusobacteria
fusobacteria were detected in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs at baseline, but this bacterial phylum was a major constituent of the jejunal microbiota in only  <dig> dog . in this dog, fusobacteria decreased to  <dig> % on day  <dig>  and rebounded to  <dig> % on day  <dig>  in the remaining dogs, fusobacteria were detected at low proportions  at the three sampling points, and overall no significant changes were observed for this phylum.

bacteroidetes
sequences belonging to the phylum bacteroidetes were detected in all dogs at all  <dig> time points . this group showed marked inter-individual differences in the response to tylosin on the phylum level. on day  <dig> the proportions of bacteroidetes were increased in  <dig> dogs, decreased in  <dig> dog, and unchanged in  <dig> dog. on day  <dig>  there was a trend for the proportions of bacteroidetes to return to baseline values. analysis on various phylogenetic levels revealed that the proportions of flavobacteriacae increased by day  <dig>  and returned to baseline by day  <dig> . in contrast, the order bacteroidales decreased in proportions in all  <dig> dogs by day  <dig> , and tended to return to baseline by day  <dig> . this was predominantly due to a significant decrease in prevotellaceae . furthermore, prevotellaceae did not recover by day  <dig> and were not detected in any of the dogs at this time point. bacteroidaceae decreased by day  <dig> , but this effect was not significant . furthermore, bacteroidaceae increased by day  <dig> .

firmicutes
the phylum firmicutes was the second most abundant bacterial group in the canine jejunum . on a phylum level, no significant changes were observed across the three time points for firmicutes. clostridiaceae increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % and decreased to  <dig> % by day  <dig>  however, this data was skewed due to a marked shift of the microbiota observed in one dog, where sequences belonging to c. perfringens-like organisms increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % to  <dig> % across the three time points . in the remaining dogs, clostridium spp. showed only moderate changes by day  <dig> and  <dig>  and overall no significant changes were observed for this bacterial group .

inter-individual differences were observed for bacillales, and their proportions increased in  <dig> dogs and decreased in  <dig> dogs by day  <dig> . lactobacillales decreased in  <dig> dogs, but increased in  <dig> dog by day  <dig>  and tended to return to baseline values by day  <dig> . on a genus level, inter-individual differences were observed for lactobacillus-like organisms, which increased in  <dig> dogs, remained stable in  <dig>  and decreased in  <dig> dog by day  <dig>  and tended to return to baseline values by day  <dig> . the proportions of enterococcus-like organisms increased from  <dig> % to  <dig> % to  <dig> % by day  <dig>  . this increase was observed in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs, whereas the proportions remained stable in the remaining dog.

proteobacteria
the phylum proteobacteria was the most abundant in the canine jejunum at all three sampling points . no significant changes were observed at the phylum level. all five classes of proteobacteria were identified , but they varied in their proportions and in their response to treatment .

α-proteobacteria were detected in all  <dig> dogs on days  <dig> and  <dig>  and in  <dig> dogs on day  <dig>  this bacterial group was decreased in all dogs on day  <dig> and  <dig>  mostly due to a decrease in sphingomonadaceae, but this effect was not significant .

individual differences were observed for β-proteobacteria with alcaligenaceae, burkholderiaceae, and neisseriaceae being the most abundant representatives . for neisseria spp. there was a moderate increase on day  <dig> and a decrease on day  <dig>  but overall these changes were not significant . δ-proteobacteria were observed in low abundance and no obvious changes were observed.

the table shows the percentages of total sequences and the number of dogs that harbored those taxa at the  <dig> treatment periods. .

γ-proteobacteria were the most predominant group and were identified in all  <dig> dogs at all time points. sequences of escherichia coli-like organisms increased significantly by day  <dig>  . this increase was observed in  <dig> dogs, where escherichia coli-like organisms became the predominant group by day  <dig>  pasteurella spp. increased significantly  by day  <dig>  and returned to baseline values on day  <dig> . this increase on day  <dig> was observed in  <dig> out of  <dig> dogs . moraxallaceae decreased in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs on day  <dig>  but increased in the remaining dog .

a significant change was observed for ε-proteobacteria . sequences belonging to this class were observed in  <dig> dogs on day  <dig>  but only in  <dig> dog each on days  <dig> and  <dig> . decreases in helicobacteariaceae and campylobacteriaceae were both contributing to this change in ε-proteobacteria .

actinobacteria
sequences belonging to the phylum actinobacteria were identified in all dogs at all time points. no consistent changes in response to tylosin were observed on the phylum level. however, significant changes were observed for some bacterial taxa within this phylum. dietziaceae increased significantly by day  <dig> . this group increased in  <dig> dogs, remained stable in  <dig> dog, and was not detected in the remaining dog. interestingly, no sequences belonging to dietziaceae were detectable on day  <dig>  streptomycetaceae were detected in  <dig> dogs on day  <dig>  but in none of the dogs on days  <dig> or  <dig> . actinomycetaceae decreased in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs, but increased in the remaining dog on day  <dig>  no bifidobacterium spp. were detected in any of the samples.

discussion
assessment of microbial diversity in the small intestine of dogs remains challenging, because anesthesia is required to obtain a sample, followed by either endoscopic or surgical collection of intestinal samples. anesthesia may alter intestinal motility, and also repeated endoscopy may lead to perturbations of the intestinal microbiota. therefore, the response of the jejunal microbiota to tylosin was evaluated in healthy beagle dogs each with a pre-existing jejunal fistula  <cit> . all dogs were accustomed to their fistula for several years and it is, therefore, unlikely that the presence of this fistula has impacted the intestinal microbiota. we collected samples using a sterile cytology brush that was advanced through the fistula. this approach is easier, faster, and more reproducible compared to the aspiration of jejunal content. furthermore, because an endoscope is too large to advance through the small lumen of the fistula, intestinal biopsies would have to be collected in a blinded fashion, which might have increased the variation in the sampling procedure. in contrast, mucosal brushings are technically easier to obtain and have been shown to be highly reproducible  <cit> . we speculate that mucosal brushings represent a mixture of luminal content and the mucosa-adherent microbiota  <cit> .

in this study, massive parallel 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing proved to be a powerful and sensitive method for the further characterization of canine small intestinal microbiota. in previous studies using a comparative 16s rrna gene based approach, up to  <dig> different bacterial phyla have been identified in the canine intestine  <cit>  we have identified  <dig> additional phyla that were not previously reported in dogs: tenericutes, cyanobacteria, verrucomicrobia, and chloroflexi. these bacterial phyla were present at low abundance, with less than 1% of all pyrosequencing tags. the ecological significance of these low abundant bacterial phyla in the canine intestine remains to be determined. furthermore, due to their low abundance, it was not possible to appreciate any significant effect due to tylosin treatment. while the overall composition of the small intestinal microbiota on a phylum through genus level was similar as reported previously in the canine duodenum using 16s rrna gene analysis  <cit> , the pyrosequencing approach has revealed a much higher richness on a species and strain level . rarefaction curves  revealed that with the number of here obtained sequencing tags per sample , we have underestimated the number of otus at 1% dissimilarity, but obtained a reasonable coverage at 3% and 5% dissimilarity. our calculations revealed that the canine jejunum harbors between  <dig> and  <dig>  bacterial species and between  <dig> and  <dig>   bacterial strains. approximately  <dig>  sequence tags would need to be analyzed per jejunal sample to cover 100% of the predicted maximum otus present in the canine jejunum. therefore, future studies evaluating the small intestinal microbiota will need to employ larger sequencing datasets to characterize changes in low abundant bacterial groups.

by altering the intestinal microbiota, antibiotics can exhibit either a deleterious or a beneficial effect on gastrointestinal health. in humans with antibiotic associated diarrhea, a disruption of the intestinal ecosystem may predispose to an overgrowth of pathogenic species   <cit> . however, antimicrobials can also be useful in the treatment of intestinal disorders. the macrolide antibiotic tylosin is commonly used for the treatment of dogs with chronic diarrhea, but the exact mode of action of tylosin remains unclear  <cit> . most dogs respond favourably within 3- <dig> days, and stool consistency remains normal during treatment. however, diarrhea often reappears within weeks after discontinuation of administration  <cit> . tylosin belongs to the macrolide class of antibiotics that is characterized by a multi-membered lactone ring  <cit> . antibiotics of the macrolide class inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by binding to the l <dig> protein of the 50s ribosomal subunit. this inhibits the translocation of peptidyl-trna from the acceptor to the donor side on the ribosome, as well as the initial steps of assembly of the 50s subunit  <cit> . macrolides are more effective in crossing the cell membrane of gram-positive bacteria compared to gram-negatives  <cit> . therefore, the proposed antibiotic activity of tylosin is directed against gram-positive bacteria  and also against some mycoplasma and chlamydia spp. while tylosin also has an effect against some gram-negative bacteria  it has no apparent effect against members of the enterobacteriaceae   <cit> .

antibiotics might exhibit their anti-diarrheal effect by either reducing total bacterial load in the gut or by modulating the proportions of specific bacterial taxa and, therefore, altering bacterial metabolites that affect the gastrointestinal tract. the here used pyrosequencing approach does not allow us to draw conclusions about changes in total bacteria within the intestine, as we did not include any measure for total bacterial load in our mucosal brushing samples. however, our approach shows changes in relative proportions of specific bacterial taxa in response to tylosin in a more comprehensive fashion than previously reported  <cit> . recent studies in humans have evaluated the response of intestinal microbiota to a short-course treatment with amoxicillin or ciprofloxacin on fecal microbiota  <cit> . similar to our results, antibiotic treatment led to major shifts in the dominant fecal bacterial populations, starting within  <dig> hours of administration  <cit> . furthermore, ciprofloxacin affected the abundance of approximately one third of all bacterial taxa  <cit> . the human fecal microbiota proved to be generally resilient, and most taxa returned to baseline within  <dig> days, but some bacterial taxa failed to recover for up to  <dig> months  <cit> .

in this study evaluating the small intestinal microbiota, we observed significant changes in the canine small intestinal microbiota in response to tylosin. results of the unifrac distance metric indicated that the jejunal microbiota of individual dogs were phylogentically more similar during tylosin administration. samples tended to cluster during tylosin administration, indicating that such changes were due to treatment effect rather than temporal variation. furthermore, in previous studies, using either bacterial culture or dgge analysis, it has been shown that the major bacterial groups in the canine jejunum display temporal stability over time  <cit> , further suggesting that the observed changes were indeed caused by tylosin treatment.

in general, the observed microbial shifts occurred in three major patterns:  bacterial groups that decreased in their proportions by day  <dig> and rebounded by day  <dig>   bacterial groups that decreased in their proportions by day  <dig> and failed to recover by day  <dig>  and  bacterial groups that increased in their proportions by day  <dig> and returned to baseline values by day  <dig>  we also observed unexpected highly individualized responses to tylosin treatment for specific bacterial taxa in some dogs. for dogs with diarrhea it is currently unknown if the effect of tylosin is mediated by a reduction in total bacterial load, by suppression of a single pathogen, or by an immunomodulatory effect  <cit> . our findings show that tylosin affects the proportion of various bacterial groups in the intestine. it is, therefore, unlikely that tylosin would have solely an effect on a single pathogen in clinical cases. it can be hypothesized that some of the observed shifts in microbial populations might contribute to the beneficial effect observed in dogs with chronic enteropathies. examples of the beneficial effect of antibiotics may include altered concentrations of secreted metabolic products, decreased competition for nutrients or vitamins, altered cross-talk with the intestinal immune system, or a modification of cellular metabolism  <cit> . to prove this hypothesis, evaluation of these bacterial groups in clinical studies involving diseased animals are required. furthermore, changes in bacterial populations will need to be correlated with treatment outcome.

it is interesting that the proportions of enterococcus-like organisms, which are commonly used in probiotic formulations increased significantly during tylosin treatment. enterococcus spp. have been reported to be resistant to tylosin in several animal studies  <cit> , and suppression of the commensal microbiota by antibiotic treatment may have allowed the proliferation of this bacterial group. for example, in one study using a continues flow culture model, a tylosin-resistant exogenous e. faecium strain could maintain itself only in the presence of tylosin  <cit> . these results support the concept that tylosin may promote the growth of potentially beneficial commensal bacteria such as enterococcus spp., which may have probiotic characteristics. a similar concept has also been suggested for the effect for the antibiotic metronidazole, also commonly used for treatment of dogs with chronic enteropathies. in humans, metronidazole increased the proportions of bifidobacterium spp.  <cit> . however, it remains unclear if a mere increase in the proportions of specific bacterial genera is sufficient to exhibit a probiotic effect. it is currently also unknown, if minor changes  as observed have any significant impact on intestinal health. to prove the concept that antibiotics may be able to promote proliferation of probiotic bacteria, it would be useful to isolate native enterococcus strains and evaluate their functional interactions with other members of the intestinal microbiota and also evaluate their probiotic properties in dogs with gastrointestinal disease.

tylosin is usually considered safe for long-term use in dogs  <cit> . however, in this study we observed some unexpected microbial shifts, which may suggest that tylosin, similar to other antibiotics, can lead to a disruption of the intestinal ecosystem and also have potentially deleterious effects on gastrointestinal health. we observed significant increases for pasteurella spp., e. coli-like organisms, and a dramatic increase in c. perfringens-like organisms in one dog. tylosin is prescribed for the therapy of upper respiratory infections associated with pasteurella multocida. however, this group increased significantly during the treatment period. it remains unclear, if pasteurella multocida has developed resistance to tylosin in the here studied dogs, or if the intestinal phylotypes differ from those isolated from the lung. tylosin appears to be an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of c. perfringens-associated diarrhea in canine patients, although resistant strains have been observed  <cit> . similarly, in a chicken model of necrotizing enteritis, tylosin quantitatively decreased the proportion of mucolytic c. perfringens  <cit> . however in this study, the percentage of c. perfringens-like organisms increased from  <dig> % on day  <dig> to  <dig> % on day  <dig> in one dog, suggesting that this dog harbored a resistant strain. our results also suggest that the proposed mode of action of an antibiotic on different bacterial genera does not necessarily match the in vivo effects, as several bacterial groups that are considered to be sensitive to tylosin increased in their proportions. because of the nature of an ecosystem, the changes that are induced by an antibiotic on one set of organisms will affect others, and this is not necessarily predicted by in vitro antibiotic sensitivities.

e. coli-like organisms, a bacterial group that has also been associated with a negative impact on gastrointestinal health in dogs  <cit>  increased significantly by day  <dig>  the enrichment of e. coli-like organisms is not surprising, as this group is intrinsically resistant to tylosin, and similar increases have been observed in pigs after tylosin treatment  <cit> . however, we have no obvious explanation why this effect was observed on day  <dig> rather than day  <dig>  the last day of tylosin administration. also, based on the techniques used, it is not possible to determine if a bacterial population proliferated or simply increased in proportion because other bacteria were affected  by the antibiotic treatment.

while e. coli-like organisms and c. perfringens increased in some of the dogs, this was not associated with any obvious clinical signs of gastrointestinal disease. we speculate that despite obvious changes in microbial populations, the intestinal ecosystem has enough functional redundancy to maintain gastrointestinal health. similar findings have also been reported in humans, where short-term courses of antibiotics led to significant shifts in fecal microbiota patterns, yet no obvious gastrointestinal signs were observed  <cit> . however, all these studies, including the present one, have evaluated healthy individuals, which may harbor a stable intestinal ecosystem that has enough functional redundancy to withstand short-term modulations. it is currently unknown how antibiotics affect dogs with gastrointestinal disease that may be more susceptible to such treatments. of interest would be also to evaluate the long-term effects of antibiotics on the temporal stability of the intestinal microbiota and their influence on gastrointestinal health. it might be possible that the microbiota in animals undergoing a course of antibiotic treatment is less stable and, therefore, at an increased risk for gastrointestinal disease or infections. follow up studies over a period of years would be needed to answer this question. in this study we have evaluated healthy dogs, and it is possible that tylosin has a different effect on the microbiota in dogs with signs of gastrointestinal disease. it is suspected that diseased dogs have an altered microbial composition, and it is possible that tylosin results in modulations in microbiota that differ from those observed in the here evaluated healthy animals. evaluating endoscopically obtained pre- and post treatment samples from dogs with tylosin-responsive diarrhea would be valuable. future studies will need also to evaluate intestinal contents for changes in bacterial metabolites or gene expression in response to antibiotic treatment as a measure of functional redundancy of the intestinal microbiota.

studies in humans have shown that the fecal microbiota are generally resilient to short-term modulations by antibiotics, but pervasive effects might last for several months for specific bacterial taxa  <cit> . the resilience of a microbial community reflects its capability to return to baseline after disturbances to the community  have ceased. less is known about the resilience of the small intestinal microbiota. our results illustrate the complexity of the intestinal microbiota and the challenges associated with evaluating the effect of antibiotic administration on the various bacterial groups and their potential interactions. our results indicate that tylosin may lead to prolonged effects on the composition and diversity of jejunal microbiota. on day  <dig>  the phylogenetic composition of the microbiota was similar to day  <dig> in only  <dig> of  <dig> dogs. bacterial diversity as measured by the shannon-weaver diversity index resembled the pre-treatment state in  <dig> of  <dig> dogs. several bacterial groups changed in their proportions in response to tylosin. after cessation of tylosin, the phyla firmicutes and fusobacteria tended to return to pretreatment values within  <dig> days. other phyla, such as bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, and spirochaetes did not return to their pre-treatment proportions. tylosin had also a pervasive effect on several bacterial groups that failed to recover by day  <dig> . those groups included spirochaetes, streptomycetaceae, sphingomonadaceae, and prevotellaceae. tylosin has a known activity against spirochaetes  <cit> . spirochaetes have been associated with intestinal disease in chickens and pigs, but their pathogenic role in dogs remains unclear, as they are commonly observed in healthy dogs as well as dogs with diarrhea  <cit> . the clinical significance of sphingomonadaceae, prevotellaceae, and streptomycetaceae in the small intestine of dogs has, to our knowledge, not been evaluated to date. furthermore, future studies with longer follow-up periods than  <dig> days after treatment cessation will be useful to evaluate the long-term effect of tylosin on the jejunal microbiota. result of such studies may indicate the time needed for the microbiota to return to its pre-treatment state.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, using deep massive parallel pyrosequencing we identified additional bacterial phyla and demonstrated the enormous species richness present in the small intestine of healthy dogs. we have demonstrated a profound and pervasive effect of tylosin on microbial diversity and various bacterial groups. these bacterial groups may represent candidates for exploration in clinical studies, and their changes will need to be correlated with clinical outcome, to further understand the effect of tylosin on gastrointestinal health.
