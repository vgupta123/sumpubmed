BACKGROUND
while local adaptation is likely to be of commonplace occurrence, demonstrating its occurrence can be difficult and take substantial research efforts  <cit> . traditionally, studies of local adaptation have been built upon quantitative genetic approaches that make use of common garden experiments and statistical genetics methods to infer genetic differentiation in phenotypic traits . quantitative genetic methods have also been increasingly combined with population genetic tools to infer local adaptation . more recently, advances in genomic technologies have made it possible to identify candidate genomic regions underlying local adaptation . among such approaches are genome scan or outlier detection methods , which allow inferences about adaptive differentiation to be made without the application of common garden experiments.

outlier detection methods have become particularly popular in identifying population structuring and adaptive differentiation in marine fishes, which generally show very low levels of genetic differentiation in neutral marker genes  <cit>  and in which common garden experiments are often logistically demanding, if not impossible, to conduct . however, with few notable exceptions , genome scan studies of marine fishes have typically been limited to tens – or in rare cases hundreds – of loci . as such, genome-wide patterns of diversity and divergence cannot thoroughly be explored, especially when the markers employed are anonymous. on the other hand, when high-throughput approaches have been used to screen thousands of loci across the genome, only a small number of populations have been under focus – generally those with obvious differentiation  <cit> . hence, high-throughput population genomic studies aimed at detecting adaptive differentiation in marine fishes are rare, especially those employing a comprehensive sampling scheme. the latter point is particularly relevant in the context of seascape genetics, which aims to integrate environmental features with population genetic data to assess their impact on the genetic structure of marine populations  <cit> . in such approaches, sampling of multiple populations across environmental gradients becomes critical for inferences about genotype–environment associations.

there has been considerable interest in studying local adaptation and genetic differentiation in three-spined sticklebacks . however, most of these studies – particularly those using high-throughput methods  <cit>  – have focused on marine–freshwater or lake–stream differentiation, with less focus on differentiation within the ancestral marine environment . nevertheless, the studies thus far – irrespective of the approach used  – suggest that there is substantial population structuring and local adaptation also in marine three-spined sticklebacks . this is most apparent in the thoroughly studied baltic sea seascape, which is characterized by steep salinity and temperature gradients. using microsatellite markers, defaveri et al.  <cit>  uncovered evidence for heterogeneous genomic differentiation and adaptive population structuring in three-spined sticklebacks across the baltic sea, suggesting that environmental heterogeneity can generate disruptive selection despite the considerable gene flow in this highly connected marine environment. in fact, the unique ecosystem of the baltic sea has attracted the attention of many evolutionary and population genetics studies that have also sought to understand local adaptation and genetic structuring of baltic sea organisms . however, as yet, studies based on genome-wide characterizations of variability with high-throughput approaches and comprehensive sampling of baltic sea populations are still missing . hence, the spatial scale of genetic structuring at the genome-wide level cannot truly be defined in any baltic sea organism.

the main aim of this study was to investigate genome-wide patterns of genetic variability and differentiation in marine three-spined sticklebacks across the baltic sea – a relatively young sea area with steep environmental gradients, subject to many earlier low-throughput studies in local adaptation  and genetic differentiation . in particular, we were interested in characterizing genomic variation across study sites that are connected by gene flow, and identifying genomic regions showing footprints of directional  selection in association with key environmental parameters . in addition, we were interested in knowing if the detected outliers correspond to those identified to be under selection in earlier stickleback studies, not only in this particular system  <cit>  but also in other more divergent population pairs . to this end, we utilized a pooled restriction site associated dna sequencing  approach  <cit>  to generate polymorphism data of > <dig>  single nucleotide sites across the genome of  <dig> three-spined stickleback populations in the baltic sea , and subjected the data to various outlier analyses, including bayenv  <cit> , which tests for associations between outliers and environmental parameters.figure  <dig>

RESULTS
restriction site associated dna sequencing dataset and snps
the three-spined stickleback genome used as a reference included  <dig>  psti restriction sites . the number of psti restriction sites on a given chromosome was significantly correlated with chromosome length . the quality-filtered rad-seq dataset used for alignment contained approximately  <dig>  million reads, and the number of reads ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig>  million within each population . in total,  <dig>  million reads were aligned to the reference genome, and the number of aligned reads ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million within each population . the number of rad-seq reads aligned on a given chromosome was significantly and positively correlated with chromosome length , both within and across populations. the number of snps within the aligned rad-seq reads varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  depending on the population, and in total  <dig>  snps were identified across all populations . the number of snps identified on each chromosome was significantly and positively correlated with the number of reads aligned on the chromosome  and with chromosome length  within each population, as well across all the populations. an example using the population cop is shown in additional file 2: figure s1: the number of psti restriction sites, mapped reads and number of snps on each chromosome are each significantly positively correlated with chromosome length. taken together, this suggests that the loci used in the downstream analyses are not a biased sample across chromosomes in respect to chromosome length.

genome-wide genetic variation
the expected heterozygosity for all snps  across all populations was  <dig>  and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  within each population. the genome-wide average nucleotide diversity  was  <dig>   =  <dig> ) across all populations and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  within each population . average π values of each chromosome within each population and across all populations are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the highest average π value within each population and across all populations was detected in chromosome xix, which is the sex chromosome. although the average nucleotide diversity in a given chromosome was significantly and positively correlated across populations , there was clear genomic heterogeneity in the levels of nucleotide diversity in different chromosomes. for example, the average π values for chromosomes iii, vi, vii, viii, ix, x, xi, xiv, xv, xx and xxi were larger than their genome-wide average π values in some populations, but smaller in other populations. the genome-wide average θw value was  <dig>   across all populations, and ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  within each population .table  <dig>

the genome-wide distribution patterns for π and θw were very similar to each other across all populations , as well as within each population , in respect to mean values of π and θw for each chromosome . however, the range of π and θw values varied widely across the genome across all populations and also within each population. for instance, π ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  and θw from  <dig>  to  <dig>  with the 100-kb sliding window . however, the genomic regions with high or low diversity were not consistent among populations , suggesting genetic differentiation among populations.figure  <dig>

to test for deviations from neutrality across all populations, tajima’s d was estimated for  <dig> regions across the genome across all populations, of which  <dig> were negative  and six were positive . this observation of most genomic regions having negative tajima’s d was found also within each population . these patterns suggest an excess of low frequency variants.

genome-wide population differentiation
with a minor allele count of  <dig> across all the  <dig> populations and coverage between  <dig> and  <dig> within each population,  <dig>  snps were identified by popoolation <dig>  pairwise fst values for the  <dig>  snps estimated with a non-overlapping 100-kb sliding window across the genome yielded an overall average pairwise fst estimate of  <dig>   across all populations . comparison of the genome-wide profile of genetic differentiation  and diversity  revealed certain general patterns. first, multiple genomic regions with high genetic diversity displayed low genetic differentiation , suggesting a role for balancing selection in maintaining high genetic diversity within and among populations. inspection of the tajima’s d estimates gave additional evidence for presence of balancing selection in genomic regions with elevated diversity: d-values were positive in genomic regions with high genetic diversity but low genetic differentiation . second, numerous genomic regions on all chromosomes  showing low genetic diversity exhibited a high degree of genetic differentiation , suggesting a varying degree of directional selection among populations.

candidate genes associated with adaptation
in total, a subset of  <dig>  snps located in  <dig>  genes were identified across all populations , and were used for detecting selection footprints. using an empirical outlier detection approach,  <dig>  snps were found at least once in the top  <dig> % tails and  <dig> snps fell within the top  <dig> % tails of at least  <dig> pairwise fst comparisons and as such, were identified as potential snps under selection. using the bayescan approach,  <dig> snps were identified as outliers  at the false discovery rate  threshold of  <dig> . in total,  <dig> snps were identified as outliers by both approaches, all of which were under directional selection and located in genomic regions of high genetic differentiation . of these  <dig> outlier loci,  <dig>  were located within  <dig> genes .figure  <dig>

the bayenv analysis based on the subset of  <dig>  snps revealed that both environmental parameters  were associated with numerous snps across the genome . with the criterion of log <dig> bayes factor  greater than  <dig>   <cit>  as evidence for an association between environmental parameter and allelic distribution,  <dig> snps were correlated with variation in salinity , and  <dig> snps were correlated with temperature variation . moreover,  <dig> snps were significantly associated with variation in both salinity and temperature. when considering the correlation with salinity variation,  <dig> snps had log <dig>  >  <dig> and  <dig> occurred in genomic regions with a high degree of genetic differentiation but low genetic diversity. the  <dig> loci were located in  <dig> genes; the snp within the gene cpeb <dig>  on chromosome iv had the highest log <dig>  . when considering correlation with annual temperature variation,  <dig> loci had log <dig>  >  <dig> and  <dig> occurred in genomic regions with a high degree of genetic differentiation but low genetic diversity. the  <dig> loci were located in  <dig> genes; the snp within the gene smap <dig>  on chromosome ix had the highest log <dig>  . of the  <dig> snps significantly associated with annual salinity variation,  <dig> were identified as outliers by bayescan. of the  <dig> snps significantly associated with annual temperature variation,  <dig> were identified as outliers by bayescan. of the  <dig> snps significantly associated with both salinity and temperature variation,  <dig> were identified as outliers by bayescan;  <dig> of these were located in  <dig> genes.figure  <dig>

a total of  <dig> genes included snps that were identified either as outliers or as having environmental correlations in the bayenv analysis . these candidate genes showed a broad range of gene ontology  annotations, and significant enrichment in several functional categories  when compared to the genes harboring neutral snps .figure  <dig>

population structure
we first took the overall average pairwise fst values among populations calculated over the subset of the  <dig>  snps to look for population structuring across the baltic sea. the average pairwise fst values ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the principal coordinates analysis  plot revealed a geographically ordered pattern: the populations from the danish straits  formed one distinct group and clustered close to the southern baltic site kbor along pco 1; populations from the gulf of bothnia  and one from the south-west baltic sea  formed one cluster along pco  <dig>  and the populations from the gulf of finland  and baltic proper  clustered together . the population structure portrayed by the neighbor-joining tree was very similar to that seen in the pco plot of overall average pairwise fst, but showed that populations from the gulf of finland  formed a distinct group . this pattern of population structuring is consistent with that recovered by an earlier microsatellite study by defaveri et al.  <cit> . accordingly, there was a significant correlation between pairwise genetic distances as measured by fst estimated from  <dig> microsatellites and the  <dig>  snps . however, genetic diversity across the populations as estimated from microsatellite and snp heterozygosity  was uncorrelated . a signal of isolation by distance was detected .table  <dig>

discussion
amongst the most salient findings of this study was the observation that although the average levels of genetic differentiation among baltic sea three-spined stickleback populations were low by all standards, numerous genomic regions displayed a high degree of population differentiation. specifically, by utilizing stringent quality and filtering criteria, we identified numerous snps likely to have diverged due to directional selection, often apparently in response to either salinity- and/or temperature-mediated selection. moreover, we also detected several genomic regions likely to be under balancing selection , including genomic regions harboring genes important for immune function. interestingly, the patterns of genome-wide genetic variation and differentiation, as well as several candidate genes for local adaptation detected in this study, were similar to those observed in the marine–freshwater divergence of three-spined sticklebacks on various geographic scales  <cit> , despite that the samples used in our study were derived from physically connected marine populations across the baltic sea. in the following, we will discuss these findings and relate our results to those of earlier studies of three-spined sticklebacks and other marine organisms. we will also discuss the implications of our findings for our understanding of local adaptation and genetic biodiversity in the baltic sea environment.

genome-wide heterogeneous differentiation in baltic sea three-spined stickleback
the patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation varied widely across the ten populations in the current study, indicating heterogeneous genomic divergence and divergent selection in baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks. these results are fully concurrent with those of an earlier study of baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks utilizing a much more limited number of microsatellite markers  <cit> . although this kind of heterogeneous divergence has also been demonstrated in other studies of marine fish populations  <cit> , to date very few such studies have employed high-throughput population genomic approaches – nor have they had access to reference genomes – to characterize the genomic architecture of adaptation . in this regard, we were able to provide a more refined picture of the genome-wide distribution of regions of differentiation in this open system of populations likely to experience multidirectional gene flow. specifically, outlier loci/regions of divergence were uncovered on every chromosome, indicating that directional selection is acting across the entire genome, rather than being restricted to a few chromosomes, as was the case for the atlantic cod  <cit> . furthermore, many divergent genomic regions showed associations with salinity and temperature, supporting the interpretation that much of this differentiation could be driven by spatially varying selection pressures. as the use of pooled samples does not allow for investigations of linkage disequilibrium, we cannot ascertain the degree or distance of linkage between these regions of divergence. however, these isolated genomic regions usually span less than 100 kb in length, and the  <dig> outlier loci we identified were actually located in  <dig> different 100-kb sliding windows. hence it is likely that individual loci within these regions are tightly linked, creating islands of divergence  in the midst of the otherwise low neutral baseline divergence. this pattern of divergence hitchhiking is consistent with theoretical  <cit>  and empirical  <cit>  studies of populations experiencing ongoing gene flow . moreover, the evidence for heterogeneous genomic divergence at the genome-wide level from this study aligns with the results of our earlier study that found a clear signal of isolation by adaptation, suggesting adaptive divergence has been reducing gene flow at a genome-wide scale  <cit> . as such, our results support the view  that selection is able to overcome the homogenizing effect of gene flow even in high-gene-flow marine environments.

several regions of reduced divergence were also uncovered in this study. however, only a few of these regions gave evidence for balancing selection – far less than those of directional selection. in this respect, our results are in stark contrast with those of an early genome scan study of this species, which found evidence for the predominant role of balancing, rather than directional selection, on expressed sequence tag and quantitative trait locus associated microsatellite loci  <cit> . these contrasting results may be explained because highly mutable – and hence also polymorphic – microsatellites may generate spurious signals of balancing selection  <cit> , whereas snps with lower mutation rates are less likely to generate such biases .

candidate genes for adaptation
our results show that three-spined sticklebacks in the baltic sea exhibit similar patterns of genetic differentiation and diversity as seen in earlier comparisons of marine–freshwater populations across their global distribution. for example, the distribution of diversity was similar to earlier studies that also reported elevated and lowered levels of genetic diversity at the ends and centers, respectively, of chromosomes i, iii, xiii, xviii and xx  <cit> . not surprisingly, these regions of increased diversity also exhibited a lowered degree of divergence and a higher incidence of balancing selection compared to other parts of the genome. for instance, as in other stickleback studies  <cit> , evidence for balancing selection was detected for the 3' end of chromosome iii. this genomic region harbors several candidate genes involved in defense against pathogens , inflammation pathways , as well as trim genes , which are known targets of balancing selection in primates  <cit> , suggesting the importance of this genomic region for immune responses  <cit> . there is growing evidence from various vertebrate studies to suggest that genetic diversity in genes related to immunity is elevated and under balancing selection presumably due to their importance for many biological functions, including immunity, mate selection and kin recognition . since pathogens are strong selective agents  <cit>  and the diversity and prevalence of stickleback parasites in the baltic sea is known to be high  <cit> , the observed footprints of balancing selection on immunity-related genes are understandable.

several genomic regions of reduced diversity and increased divergence detected in this study are also consistent with those reported in earlier studies of differentiation among marine–freshwater three-spined sticklebacks  <cit> , as well as sticklebacks in the baltic sea  <cit> . for example, genomic regions on chromosomes i, iv, xi and xxi have repeatedly been identified as divergent between marine and freshwater three-spined sticklebacks in north america  <cit>  and eurasia  <cit> . chromosome iv is of particular interest, as the gene related to lateral plate number variation – ectodysplasin a   <cit>  – is located within a genomic region of increased divergence on this chromosome . our finding of elevated divergence in the genomic region containing the eda locus matches well with results of an earlier study that reported significant differentiation among baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks in both the number of lateral plates and the quantitative trait locus tightly linked to eda  <cit> . thus, the results of our study provide matching evidence for ongoing selection on eda in baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks, and act as a proof-of-principle demonstration that the uncovered signatures of selection are likely to be real, rather than methodological artifacts or noise. the same is true for the gene ahr1b  , which was identified as a candidate gene both in the current study as well as in our earlier genome scan of baltic sea sticklebacks  <cit> . further evidence to substantiate this interpretation is provided by comparison to earlier targeted genome scan studies based on microsatellite markers in sticklebacks. these studies provided evidence for directional selection on  <dig> genomic regions harboring genes physiologically relevant for freshwater adaptation in a global survey of marine–freshwater populations  <cit> , and for nine genomic regions in baltic sea populations  <cit> . the average pairwise fst for the genomic regions harboring these markers in this study was  <dig> , which was slightly higher than the average fst across the whole genome , demonstrating that the regions harboring genes indicated to be under directional selection in earlier studies also show increased genomic divergence in the current study.

to set our results more firmly in the context of earlier targeted genome scan studies  <cit>  and genome-wide sequencing studies  <cit> , we compiled a list of candidate genes  detected in our study  and compared these to those found in earlier studies. of the  <dig> candidate genes identified here,  <dig>  were also identified to be involved in marine–freshwater divergence of three-spined sticklebacks in earlier studies , for example, genes cpeb <dig>  and pparaa  on chromosome iv  <cit> . an additional  <dig> were identified in a study investigating differential expression of salinity-related genes among freshwater and seawater sticklebacks acclimated to different salinity treatments  <cit> . interestingly, allelic variation in most of these candidate genes  was strongly associated with salinity variation, suggesting that environmental salinity has been the selective agent driving genetic differentiation in these loci among baltic sea three-spined populations. in addition to the genes listed in table  <dig>  different paralogs from the same gene families were identified to be under selection both in the baltic sea and other three-spined stickleback populations. for example, the gene slc6a <dig>   was significantly associated with annual salinity variation in baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks, whereas its highly similar paralog slc6a <dig>   has been identified as a candidate for marine–freshwater divergence  <cit> . this suggests that some of the candidate genes that contribute to repeated adaptation of three-spined sticklebacks to freshwater habitats may also be involved with local adaptation in the environmentally heterogeneous baltic sea environment. however, it is worth noting that many candidate genes – and also the general patterns of diversity and divergence – identified in marine–freshwater population pairs are also found among pairs of lake–stream sticklebacks  <cit> . hence, this may instead indicate that similar constraints imposed by the architecture of the stickleback genome generate similar patterns between our and earlier marine–freshwater studies, rather than similar processes . moreover, it is important to note that in spite of the various lines of evidence that selection is acting on specific genes, empirical demonstration of their functional role is necessary ultimately to validate the inference of selection on candidate variants.table  <dig>

local adaptation to the margin: baltic sea
the baltic sea is a relatively young postglacial ecosystem, formed  <dig>  to  <dig>  years ago and characterized by steep environmental gradients in salinity, temperature and community composition  <cit> . earlier reviews have continually drawn attention to the reduced genetic diversity of baltic sea organisms compared to populations in the surrounding seas  <cit> . given that diversity is a prerequisite for adaptation, it may appear that populations in the baltic sea may face challenges in adapting to the projected environmental changes, e.g., in salinity and temperature. however, the results of this study suggest the contrary. earlier evidence for adaptive divergence among baltic sea sticklebacks as revealed by a limited number of microsatellite markers was here confirmed to be ubiquitous across the genome. it is likely that such adaptation has arisen from the use of standing genetic variation, since the young age of the baltic sea has not allowed much time for new mutations to accumulate. indeed, the importance of standing genetic variation, as well as the general features of the genomic architecture in ancestral marine sticklebacks, have been demonstrated to play important roles in extensive and parallel genome-wide evolution  <cit> . however, this has mostly been demonstrated in divergent, isolated population pairs. our results suggest that the same processes can also occur in the face of gene flow, possibly due to the genomic architecture, which may provide a mechanism for the rapid re-assembly and evolution of multi-locus genotypes in newly colonized freshwater habitats  <cit> . similar evidence for adaptive divergence is also available from other baltic sea species, albeit the scale of sampling and/or marker numbers have often been modest . to this end, the results support the view that in spite of its young age and low species diversity , the genetic biodiversity stemming from local adaptation to the baltic sea seascape may be more widespread than is currently anticipated.

methodological considerations
finally, regarding the methodological considerations, we note that theoretical treatments have shown that sequencing of pooled dna samples  can be more effective in snp discovery and can provide more accurate allele frequency estimates than individual sequencing  <cit> . nevertheless, pool-seq has its shortcomings: it compromises the ability to conduct certain types of analyses, and certain types of biases and artifacts are possible . first, information about associations among alleles in different loci is lost, as is the opportunity to estimate linkage disequilibrium. second, differential amplification of individual samples can create biases in allele frequency estimates  <cit> . likewise, the assessment of population divergence will be complicated since the sample size  available for allele frequency estimation varies among loci. for example, when using popoolation tools  <cit> , the accuracy of allele frequency estimation from pooled samples is highly dependent on the sequencing coverage, although the pipeline implements unbiased estimation by considering pool size and sequencing coverage  <cit> . however, we believe our inference is robust in respect to these potential caveats on the basis of the following. first, the distribution pattern of sequencing coverage for the snps we identified was very similar across populations , suggesting little heterogeneity in sequencing coverage  across populations. second, we found that the genome-wide patterns of population differentiation were stable when sequencing coverage varied . thus, at least for sequencing coverage, the results and inferences in this paper should be robust. this inference is further supported because the patterns of genomic variability and differentiation observed in this study align well with those seen in other rad-seq based analyses , as well as those seen for microsatellite markers in the same set of populations . if large biases in allele frequency estimates were present, such similarities would be unexpected. comparison of the pool-seq allele frequency estimates with those generated from  <dig> snps genotyped at the individual level verified this conjecture: the correlation between allele frequency estimates across different loci ranged from r =  <dig>  to r =  <dig>  depending on the population . likewise, the correlation between allele frequencies from individual and pooled samples across the  <dig> loci and all populations was very high .

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we discovered that genome-wide patterns of genetic diversity and differentiation among continuously distributed baltic sea three-spined stickleback populations – as assessed from polymorphisms in over  <dig>  snp loci – varied widely across the genome. as such, we identified numerous genomic regions exhibiting signatures of divergent – and to some extent also balancing – selection. we also uncovered strong evidence for substantial genetic differentiation associated with both salinity and temperature gradients, suggesting local adaptation in this high-gene-flow environment. the patterns of genome-wide genetic diversity and differentiation in baltic sea three-spined sticklebacks were similar to those observed in earlier studies of marine–freshwater divergence in three-spined sticklebacks, suggesting that the same genetic processes and loci may often underlie adaptation both to freshwater and brackish water environments. hence, apart from providing strong evidence for genome-wide but heterogeneous genomic divergence driven by local adaptation along an environmental gradient in the post-glacially formed baltic sea seascape, our results suggest similarities in genomic signatures of adaptation to freshwater and brackish water environments.
