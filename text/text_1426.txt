BACKGROUND
the heat shock protein hsp <dig> is a fundamental molecular mechanism of inducible thermotolerance, but it does not act alone. genetic, biochemical and physiological analyses in drosophila and numerous systems establish hsp70's central role  <cit> . however central, hsp <dig> must work as part of an interactive network of other hsps: some inducible, some constitutive  <cit> . transgenic studies have established that specific modification of hsp <dig> expression alters thermotolerance in cells and organisms  <cit> . still, the degree to which hsp <dig> itself generates stress-tolerance phenotypes, versus the interactions of hsp <dig> with other hsps, remains difficult to tease apart.

such dissection is necessary for research in the prophylactic stress protection of cells, tissues and organisms to progress. ideal candidate genes for manipulation will maximize protection with minimal cost to the organism. hsp <dig> is a poor candidate: although induction of hsp <dig> is protective of future stress, in the absence of such a stress, hsp <dig> is deleterious  <cit> . thus, the challenge is to identify genes that promote stress tolerance in the absence of hsp <dig>  a task made difficult by hsp70's critical position in the stress-response network. finding these genes demands simple genetic tools to disrupt hsp70's role in the stress response, and better understanding of the richness of the network itself. beyond identification of genes whose expression is modified by stress, analysis of stress-by-hsp70-by-gene expression interactions is required.

gong and golic  <cit>  provided a key toolkit by specifically deleting the hsp <dig> genes from the drosophila melanogaster genome, producing complete and partial knockout strains. in this study we employ two of these strains: one lacks all hsp70s, the other lacks half . the deletion strains are an ideal counterpart to the extra-hsp <dig> flies produced by welte et al  <cit>  and allow direct measurement of hsp70's contribution to thermotolerance and the stress-response network. in addition, whole-genome expression analyses have dissected the inducible heat shock transcriptional response in wild-type and mutant flies. sorensen et al  <cit>  established that beyond rapid hsp induction, thermal stress upregulates and downregulates multiple hsp and non-hsp genes in at least three temporally distinct expression clusters. neal et al  <cit>  applied a similar approach to examining flies whose heat-inducible transcriptional response was ablated by mutation in hsf . disruption of hsf activity at heat shock elements in hsp gene promoters eliminates much stress-inducible hsp expression , but increases inducible expression of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> 

both hsp <dig> and hsf mutant flies maintain some degree of thermotolerance  <cit> . gong and golic suggest that compensatory modification of both constitutive and inducible heat shock gene expression  may underlie the maintenance of thermotolerance. neal et al  <cit>  report that in addition to hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  the glutathione s-transferase gste <dig> is induced by heat shock in hsf mutant flies. these studies suggest that elimination of hsp70/hsf uncovers additional compensating mechanisms of thermotolerance and exacerbates them. perturbing the participation of hsp <dig> in the hsp network may thus expose and modify the expression profiles of genes such as hsc70- <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and gste <dig> that promote thermotolerance when hsp <dig> cannot. recent work also assigns key stress-protective roles to drosophila inducible small hsps such as hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  <cit>  and constitutive hsc70s  <cit> , whose functional independence from hsp <dig> remains poorly understood. these and additional candidate stress-protective genes could protect organisms from future stress, with lower costs than hsp <dig> 

in this study, we examined the expression of genes sensitive to stress and hsp <dig> modification in a panel of hsp <dig> mutant strains undergoing thermal stress. we designed critical stresses to maximize the 'signals' of hsp <dig> manipulation  because uncovering mechanisms of compensation for hsp <dig> loss requires establishing the precise modes of thermotolerance that hsp <dig> controls. thus, we first sought to identify lesions in thermotolerance that differentiated hsp <dig> null, underexpressing, wild-type and overexpressing flies, to determine whether hsp <dig> null flies would be quantitatively or qualitatively different. next, we measured the effects of hsp <dig> manipulation on expression of constitutive and inducible stress-response genes during the critical stresses. we sought to determine whether multiple genes would respond coordinately, whether constitutive versus inducible genes would respond similarly and, finally, how genetic modification of hsp <dig> expression modifies stress-by-gene expression interactions. thus, we ask the question: if compensation for hsp <dig> loss truly exists, do its genetic bases include alteration of stress gene expression?

RESULTS
treatments
based on preliminary experiments, we designed and applied the following treatments in analyses of thermotolerance and gene expression: 'c',  <dig> h at 22°c; 'pt',  <dig> h at 36°c followed by  <dig> h at 22°c; 'hs39', 'hs <dig> ',  <dig> h at 22°c followed by  <dig> h at  <dig> or  <dig> °c; 'pt+hs39', 'pt+hs <dig> ',  <dig> h at 36°c, followed by  <dig> h at 22°c, followed by  <dig> h at  <dig> or  <dig> °c. see the methods section for a detailed description.

thermotolerance
variation in larval thermotolerance among the strains is highly significant according to binary logistic regression, and extremely sensitive to temperature . hsp70- larvae experience an approximate 10% reduction in survival following c treatment, while the other strains do not. thermal pretreatment marginally decreases survival, with the effect inversely related to hsp <dig> copy number. the haploid genomic hsp <dig> copy number of the strains we examined is: hsp70-, 0; hsp70a-ba-,3;hsp70+, 6;hsp70traiii,  <dig>  <cit> . all strains have zero basal thermotolerance of  <dig> °c . in contrast, basal thermotolerance of 39°c is positively associated with hsp <dig> copy number , and ranges from  <dig> to 30% . a separate logistic regression of survival of hs <dig> on hsp <dig> copy number is significant .

strains: hsp70-, hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+, hsp70traiii. treatments: c, pt, hs <dig>  hs <dig> , pt+hs <dig> and pt+hs <dig>  as described in the text. log-likelihood = - <dig> . all χ <dig> values significant at p <  <dig> . test that all slopes are zero: g =  <dig> , degrees of freedom  =  <dig>  p-value p <  <dig> .

inducible thermotolerance  is more strongly affected by hsp <dig> copy number. at 39°c, the hsp70- displays 2% induced survival, while all other strains are indistinguishable at 86–95%. at  <dig> °c, inducible thermotolerance ranges from  <dig> to 75% and is positively associated with hsp <dig> copy number in a strongly linear fashion . logistic regression of survival of pt+hs <dig>  on hsp <dig> copy number is significant .

analysis of gene expression
we analyzed quantitative real-time pcr  data according to montooth et al  <cit> : expression is measured as a reciprocal of critical threshold . briefly, following univariate tests of normality, mixed analysis of variance  models were fitted to expression values using maximum likelihood estimation and the sas software suite . mixed models included random effects of strain, treatment, timepoint, extraction replicate and polymerase chain reaction  plate and replicate. expression of the ribosomal-protein gene rpl <dig> was included as a continuous covariate of candidate gene expression level, to account for variation in rna/cdna preparation. thus, least square mean  estimates reported by the anova reflect each gene's expression level when controlling for variation in rpl <dig>  and are reported in natural units accordingly . rpl <dig> expression was significantly affected by treatment ; specifically, hs and pt+hs treatments reduced rpl <dig> expression in all strains, likely reflecting overall reduction in non-heat shock gene transcription during severe thermal stress  <cit> . however, these treatments did not reduce the correlation between rpl <dig> and other genes: rpl <dig> is a significant predictor of candidate gene expression in all gene/timepoint combinations but three . see the discussion section for further consideration of raw versus modeled gene expression data and the implications of variation in control gene expression under experimental treatments.

'gene' and 'time' indicate gene examined and time following treatment, respectively. remaining columns indicate f-statistics associated with effects of strain , treatment , strain-by-treatment interaction , and expression of the rpl <dig> control gene . significance levels: ****, p <  <dig> ; ***, p <  <dig> ; **, p <  <dig> ; *, p <  <dig> . cells without asterisks indicate statistically insignificant values. † indicates that hsc70- <dig> was not amplified with sufficient efficiency to calculate a standard curve and was excluded from analysis. ‡ indicates that hsp67bb was not amplified with sufficient specificity and was excluded from analysis.

we analyzed expression at zero and one hour post-treatment separately for simplicity; when included as an effect in a combined anova, timepoint, timepoint by strain and timepoint by treatment interactions were highly significant for more than 75% of genes examined . we measured fold changes in expression in two ways: within strains and between strains. in both cases, fold changes are calculated as reaction efficiencies raised to the power of differences between lsm  ct values  <cit> . within strains, we measured fold changes in gene expression after heat treatments relative to control treatment . between strains, we measured fold changes in gene expression within treatments and timepoints .

hsp <dig> expression
low levels of apparent hsp <dig> products were amplified from hsp70- cdna. after most treatments, levels of hsp <dig> amplification in the hsp70- strain are orders of magnitude lower . for example, hsp <dig> levels in the hsp70- strain immediately after c treatment are  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold lower than the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains after c treatment, respectively. immediately after pt treatment, levels are  <dig> -, 414262- and 1515423-fold reduced .

treatments are as described in the text.

we confirmed that the hsp70- strain lacked full-length genomic hsp <dig> copies via individual-fly pcr . amplification of a  <dig> kb fragment conserved in all genomic hsp <dig> copies, corresponding to the 3' half of the  <dig> kb coding sequence , was unsuccessful off of hsp70- individual-fly dna templates. the same reaction conducted off of dna from all other strains produced a single band . dna of all strains yielded successful amplification of a  <dig> kb control fragment . these results indicate that the hsp70- strain lacks hsp <dig> gene copies of at least  <dig> kb, in agreement with the southern blotting of gong and golic  <cit> . however, when we amplified the  <dig> bp hsp <dig> fragment from the 3' end of the cds used in quantitative pcr off of the individual-fly dnas, a faint band was observable in hsp70- lanes . amplification of the rpl <dig> fragment produced bands of consistent intensity across strains , indicating that the faint hsp <dig> product in the hsp70- strain may result from amplification of a rare target. raising the annealing temperature by 5°c further reduces the hsp70- band intensity, consistent with this idea . we sequenced the  <dig> bp hsp <dig> product obtained from an hsp70- individual, and found it was 100% identical to hsp70aa/hsp70ab cds .

to further establish the nature of this fragment in the hsp70- strain, we took advantage of divergent sites near the 5' end of the hsp <dig> cds. positions  <dig> and  <dig>  bear fixed nucleotide differences that differentiate hsp70aa and hsp70ab from hsp70ba, hsp70bb, hsp70bbb and hsp70bc. we designed primers whose 3' ends fell on these divergent sites to differentially amplify the otherwise ~96% identical cdss. amplification of this  <dig> bp fragment using the hsp70aa/hsp70ab-specific primers failed in all hsp70- and hsp70a-ba- individuals but was successful in all hsp70+ and hsp70traiii individuals . using the hsp70ba/hsp70bb/hsp70bbb/hsp70bc-specific primers resulted in successful amplification from individuals of all strains except hsp70- . the above results suggest that a fragment of either hsp70aa or hsp70ab remains in the hsp70- genome, that the fragment consists of less than  <dig> kb of the 3' end of the  <dig> kb cds and that this fragment is expressed. the hsp <dig> deletions have neither been mapped to the nucleotide level nor confirmed via protein analysis  <cit> . therefore, the full sequence, proximity to promoter and protein-coding potential of the truncated hsp <dig> product in the hsp70- strain remain unknown. regardless of the source of the hsp70- short product, its expression levels are extremely low . in the following, we consider strains' hsp <dig> levels relative to their own control treatment values; therefore, hsp <dig> levels in the hsp70- strain have no impact on measurement in any other strain.

hsp <dig> expression after pt is positively associated with hsp <dig> copy number in all strains, and is sensitive to both temperature and recovery time . mixed model anovas report highly significant strain, treatment and strain-by-treatment interaction effects at both zero and one hour post-treatment . figure  <dig> illustrates lsm estimates of hsp <dig> expression, calculated by the mixed model anovas, and fold changes at different treatments  relative to c levels. induction immediately after pt, relative to c levels, ranges from 13- to 144-fold . after  <dig> h of recovery, hsp <dig> pt induction relative to c is reduced and ranges from 3- to 72-fold. at both timepoints, levels of pt induction increase linearly with hsp <dig> copy number.

hs and pt+hs treatments cause hsp <dig> expression to fall to control levels or below control levels in the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains. in the hsp70- strain, a slight increase in expression follows pt and pt+hs treatments , likely representing expression of an imprecisely deleted hsp70aa or hsp70ab cds . the increase is consistent with the strong induction of other hsps after pt+hs in this strain . overall, while pt strongly induces hsp <dig> in the non-null strains to a degree consistent with their hsp <dig> copy number, the other treatments do not induce hsp <dig>  these results are consistent with previous observations regarding hsp <dig> expression over short timescales: thermal treatments of 30–37°c immediately induce hsp <dig>  but more severe temperatures do not  <cit> .

expression of other genes
we examined the expression of seven constitutive stress-response genes  and ten inducible stress-response genes , immediately and  <dig> h after treatment. as indicated in table  <dig>  problematic genes were not considered: hsc70- <dig> failed to amplify efficiently and was excluded from analysis. hsp67bb was not amplified with sufficient specificity and produced multiple pcr products. hsp67ba showed no significant strain, treatment or strain-by-treatment interaction effects immediately after treatment and was excluded from analysis. hsp67bc showed significant treatment and strain-by-treatment interaction effects; however, because the majority of the hsp <dig> genes were excluded, we did not consider hsp67bc further .

the remaining genes showed significant strain, treatment and strain-by-treatment interaction effects in the majority of cases, according to anovas . we classified these genes as inducible or constitutive based on whether they displayed upregulation following pt in a majority of strains. neal et al  <cit>  considered hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> as 'constitutive' and both genes are expressed in c conditions . however, both genes showed strong upregulation following pt and are coordinately expressed with the other inducible genes we examined . as above, we report each gene's lsm expression level, calculated by the mixed model anovas, and express fold changes at different treatments relative to c levels . note that fold changes in figures  <dig> and  <dig> reflect averages of the inducible and constitutive genes in each figure.

inducible genes
hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig> and hsp <dig> display coordinate expression patterns within strains, but divergent patterns between hsp70- and the other strains . in the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains, expression is upregulated at both zero and one hour after pt, with average fold induction relative to c ranging from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold . expression following hs and pt+hs treatments returns to c levels or below, with the exception of hsp <dig> and hsp <dig>  which are slightly upregulated after pt+hs <dig> in the hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains. average fold expression relative to c for all seven genes at pt+hs <dig>  at both timepoints, ranges from a decrease of  <dig> -fold to an increase of 2-fold . the above patterns are concordant with patterns of hsp <dig> expression .

the hsp70- strain displays a qualitatively different pattern of expression for the inducible genes in comparison with the other strains . expression of all seven genes is upregulated after pt to a level indistinguishable from the other strains; however, pt+hs treatments also cause upregulation. expression is especially pronounced  <dig> h after pt+hs <dig> . in contrast, the other strains show net downregulation after the pt+hs treatments.

constitutive genes
hsc70- <dig>  hsc70- <dig>  hsc70- <dig>  hsc70- <dig>  hsp <dig> and gste <dig> also display coordinate expression patterns in the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains, and divergence in the hsp70- strain . expression levels during control conditions vary among genes, but within strains, each gene's expression is generally not upregulated by pt . in the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains, hs causes downregulation of the constitutive genes, with the effect increasing with time: by  <dig> h post-treatment, average expression levels decrease  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold relative to c . in the hsp70- strain, this effect is absent at hs <dig> and reversed at hs <dig> , where average expression increases  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold . pt+hs treatments cause further downregulation in the hsp70a-ba-, hsp70+ and hsp70traiii strains at both timepoints, with the decrease ranging from  <dig> - to  <dig> -fold . in contrast, the hsp70-strain shows net upregulation after pt+hs treatments. this effect is largely due to hsc70- <dig> and hsc70- <dig>  which have lower c and pt expression levels in the hsp70- strain than in the other strains, and rise after pt+hs instead of falling .

discussion
our results indicate that hsp <dig> loss causes alterations of both inducible and constitutive stress gene expression that are ultimately insufficient for inducible tolerance of severe heat shock. in addition, we find that both increasing hsp <dig> copy number and hsp <dig> expression are associated with increases in the expression of multiple inducible hsp genes . we now discuss the implications of these results for stress tolerance, compensatory gene expression and the regulation of hsp gene expression.

thermotolerance
inducible thermotolerance is severely curtailed in the hsp70- strain and increases linearly with hsp <dig> copy number in the other strains. the effect is especially pronounced at  <dig> °c . these results are consistent with previous research  <cit> , but highlight the extreme sensitivity of thermotolerance traits to assay temperature. furthermore, the strong differences between basal and inducible thermotolerance among the strains reflect the potent effect of thermal pretreatment and heat shock protein induction. previous research reported the maintenance of some degree of thermotolerance in the hsp70- strain, when assayed at lower heat shock temperatures and different heat shock durations that may not maximize the input of hsp <dig> . here, we designed our thermotolerance assays to maximize differences in survival among strains varying in hsp <dig> copy number and expression and have found the hsp70- strain almost completely deficient in basal and inducible tolerance of severe heat shock . we measured gene expression in animals undergoing the same severe thermal treatments and interpreted differences among the strains accordingly.

analysis of gene expression
when measuring gene expression via qrtpcr, researchers typically express candidate gene levels relative to a control gene, often a 'housekeeping' gene that is ubiquitously expressed independently of experimental treatments. this adjustment serves to control for variation in rna/cdna extractions. rather than express our measurements in candidate gene:control gene ratios, here we estimate each gene's own expression level according to an anova model which includes expression of the rpl <dig> control gene as a covariate. the model also includes effects imparted by both experimental error  and the biology we wish to explore . rpl <dig>  strain and treatment all have a significant effect on candidate gene expression , indicating that these factors, rather than error, explain much of the variation in gene expression.

does the fact that rpl <dig> expression is itself affected by the treatments we employed have an impact on the analysis? specifically, rpl <dig> expression decreases with hs and pt+hs treatments across strains. notwithstanding a sensible biological interpretation of this observation , we would predict that if rpl <dig> was a more important factor in candidate gene expression than strain or treatment, our model would perform poorly during hs and pt+hs and, thus, generate lsm estimates that do not match raw expression values.

we recalculated the expression curves presented in figures  <dig> and  <dig> using raw data  rather than lsms and found the opposite. the curves are given as additional file  <dig> and additional file  <dig> and are strikingly concordant with the model outputs illustrated in figures  <dig> and  <dig>  the effects of treatment and strain on hsp gene expression levels are evident whether considering modeled or raw data. this indicates that the biological signals  are stronger than the 'noise' imparted by variation in control gene expression and/or experimental error.

inducible gene expression
the expression levels of seven inducible hsp genes after pt, relative to c levels, are high in all of the strains we examined but are not strongly associated with hsp <dig> copy number . however, when considered in isolation, c and pt expression levels appear to increase with hsp <dig> copy number . furthermore, hsp <dig> expression clearly increases with hsp <dig> copy number when expressed either in absolute or pt-relative-to-c terms . finally, the housekeeping rpl <dig> gene levels remain a highly significant covariate in every inducible gene/timepoint combination but two . this indicates that the distribution of error associated with variation in rna/cdna manufacture is not unevenly associated with any strain, gene or timepoint, and that direct comparison of absolute inducible gene expression levels  is possible. we therefore explored whether the highest absolute inducible hsp expression levels in each strain, those produced by pt, could be predicted by corresponding pt hsp <dig> expression levels. since the expression levels of hsp <dig> and the other hsps each have associated error, simple linear regression is inappropriate for exploring this relationship. as such, we conducted reduced major axes regression using the software of k van der linde  <cit> . we pooled raw zero- and one-hour pt expression data  within each strain and regressed the other hsps on hsp <dig> 

we find that after pt, hsp <dig> expression is a strong predictor of other inducible hsp expression . the four strains cluster on both axes, indicating that increasing hsp <dig> copy number is strongly associated with both measures of gene expression. that multiple hsp genes would show coordinate upregulation following thermal pretreatment is not surprising: the inducible hsp genes were first noticed as a suite of heat-induced transcriptional puffs and their coexpression is well established  <cit> . we thus might expect that strains or species that vary in the amount or activity of a known global stress-response regulator, such as hsf, could show coordinate alteration of hsp gene expression levels. these strains, however, differ only in hsp <dig> copy number and hsp <dig> expression. this indicates that the hsp <dig> gene or hsp <dig> protein has coordinate effects on other hsp expression, and that increasing hsp <dig> levels in turn upregulate the other hsps . a broad effect of hsp <dig> on the regulation of other hsps is consistent with previous research, but the positive direction of the effect is unexpected.

in many systems, free hsp <dig> protein can bind to hsf and prevent transactivation that stimulates hsp transcription, thereby negatively regulating hsp levels in a classic feedback loop  <cit> . consistent with this model, overexpression of hsp <dig> protein in the absence of stress can repress inducible transcription of hsp genes  <cit> . however, our results indicate that increasing hsp <dig> gene expression levels are associated with increases in the expression of other hsp genes, at least over brief timescales. this unexpected finding hints at additional mechanisms of hsp transcriptional regulation independent of hsp70/hsf protein interaction, and requires further research. an intriguing possibility involves a candidate 'cost' of hsp <dig> expression in the absence of severe heat shock  <cit> . hsp <dig> is a generalist chaperone that, in the absence of thermally denatured protein substrates to bind, could instead bind diverse proteins and pull them from their native conformations. these newly non-native proteins could in turn induce a further stress response, including the upregulation of additional hsp genes. this misregulation would be especially deleterious when hsp <dig> is overexpressed, such as in the hsp70traiiistrain, and when thermal conditions strongly induce hsp <dig> but do not precede a severe heat shock, such as the pt treatment we employed. clearly, existing and future studies of stress induced gene expression in drosophila, especially those examining global transcriptional responses in mutant or selected strains that may vary in hsp <dig> expression  <cit> , should be examined for coordinate upregulation of other hsps.

in contrast to the association between levels of hsp <dig> and the other inducible hsp genes after pt, the inducible hsps are upregulated after pt+hs in the hsp70- line. this result is clearly not explained by increasing hsp <dig> copy number. it is, however, consistent with increased thermal damage in the hsp70- strain and/or improper repression of the heat shock response. thermally denatured proteins are a primary stimulus of the heat shock response  <cit> . since hsp70- larvae fail to survive pt+hs, perhaps the increase in hsp expression simply reflects that the severity of stress combined with lack of hsp <dig> causes extensive hsp-inducing protein damage . alternatively, the lack of hsp <dig> could cause failure of proper hsp transcriptional attenuation post-stress. this hypothesis was favored by gong and golic  <cit> , who applied a brief, mild heat shock to the hsp70-strain and observed transcriptional hsp 'puffing' on polytene chromosomes that persisted longer than that observed in a wild-type strain. we did not observe upregulation of the inducible hsps after hs in the hsp70- strain, even though survival of hs and pt+hs is equally low. this may indicate that over the short timespan in which we examined gene expression, pt+hs is more damaging than hs . to explore whether hs eventually upregulates the inducible hsps in the hsp70- strain, future research will examine patterns of gene expression, thermal tissue damage and cellular damage indicators such as protein aggregates and ubiquitin conjugates at additional, extended timepoints. whether the hsp upregulation in the hsp70- strain is a result of damage and/or a lack of transcriptional repression is an open question. regardless of the mechanism of hsp upregulation after pt+hs in the hsp70- strain, the response is clearly not sufficient to generate increased inducible thermotolerance .

constitutive gene expression
as was seen with the inducible hsps, the constitutive genes display coordinate regulation . the direction of regulation, however, is different: the constitutive genes are expressed at low levels after c and pt, and rise with hs <dig>  and both pt+hs treatments in the hsp70- strain, as opposed to falling from higher c and pt levels to low hs and pt+hs levels in the other strains. furthermore, hsp <dig> levels do not predict levels of the constitutive genes to the degree they did for the inducible genes. these results indicate that hsp <dig> may be more uncoupled from the regulation of the constitutive genes. neal et al  <cit>  reported upregulation of constitutive stress gene expression in hsf mutant drosophila and suggested that such upregulation could compensate for the loss of inducible hsp expression. our results suggest that disrupting hsp <dig> specifically, instead of the entire inducible hsp response through hsf, induces similar upregulation of constitutive genes while also influencing the expression of other inducible hsps. again, however, the modification of gene expression caused by hsp <dig> loss does not provide compensatory thermotolerance in our assays.

we identified genes whose expression is altered by thermal stress in hsp <dig> mutant backgrounds: genes that did not provide compensatory thermotolerance in our assays. future experiments will determine whether inducing any of these genes prior to stress application will promote thermotolerance in the hsp70- strain. given the strong effect of hsp <dig> modification on inducible and constitutive hsp expression, determining whether and how any of these candidate stress protective genes can operate independently of hsp <dig> and its associated costs remains a challenge.

CONCLUSIONS
hsp <dig> copy number is strongly associated with thermotolerance, with the hsp70- strain displaying virtually zero basal or inducible tolerance of 39°c and  <dig> °c. hsp <dig> copy number is also strongly positively associated with thermal-pretreatment induction levels of hsp <dig> and seven other inducible hsp genes, suggesting an upregulatory effect of hsp <dig> on the stress-induced transcriptional response. the hsp70- strain displays qualitatively different patterns of gene expression after severe heat stress, including upregulation of inducible and constitutive hsps. since these alterations do not produce increased thermotolerance in the hsp70- strain, they do not represent genetic mechanisms of phenotypic compensation, but suggest candidate genes for prophylactic overexpression.
