BACKGROUND
eosinophilic granulocytes, commonly called eosinophils, are leukocytes that develop in the bone marrow and differentiate from hematopoietic progenitor cells  <cit> . eosinophils traffic into tissues, such as the gastrointestinal, genitourinary and respiratory tracts  <cit> , and are recruited to airway tissues during the asthmatic inflammatory process  <cit> . activated eosinophils release cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha   <cit>  and granular toxic proteins. among which eosinophil cationic protein  and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin  share 67% amino acid sequence identity  <cit>  and play important roles in the pathogenesis of mammalian cells  <cit> .

ecp is a member of the pancreatic-type extracellular ribonuclease  family, in which ecp and edn are respectively named as rnase <dig> and rnase <dig>  <cit> . it has been extensively investigated as an efficacious biomarker of airway inflammation such as asthma  <cit>  and has been suggested as a causal factor in allergic respiratory disease  <cit> . ecp is a potent cytotoxic protein capable of killing cells of guinea pig tracheal epithelium  <cit> , mammalian leukemia  <cit> , epidermis carcinoma  <cit> , and breast carcinoma  <cit>  as well as non-mammalian cells such as parasites, bacteria, and viruses  <cit> . the molecular mechanisms of ecp cytotoxicity are not involved in its rnase activity  <cit> . interestingly, we have previously shown that the signal peptide of ecp is toxic to cells lacking of the signal peptide peptidase, an intra-membrane protease located in the endoplasmic reticulum   <cit>  and it also triggers up-regulation of transforming growth factor alpha  expression in human cells  <cit> . mature ecp devoid of the 27-residue signal peptide contains  <dig> residues with high positive charges  <cit> . cellular uptake and cytotoxicity of rnases have been correlated with the pi value and positive charge  <cit> . we have recently reported that mature ecp is cytotoxic to human bronchial epithelial  cells by specific binding to cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans  followed by endocytosis  <cit> .

many rnases, such as edn, onconase , and ecp have been reported to induce apoptosis in cells  <cit> . in one such study, a synthetic peptide of edn was found to induce apoptosis in kaposi's sarcoma cells  <cit> . moreover, onc, one member of bullfrog rnase a superfamily, displays apoptosis to tumor cells  <cit> . a latest study indicated that ecp caused cytotoxicity in hl- <dig> and hela cells via caspase- <dig> like activity  <cit> . accordingly, cytotoxic rnases play an important role in cell death. however, the mechanism of ecp-induced apoptosis is still not fully verified. recent studies have shown that eosinophils can induce epithelial cell death via apoptosis and necrosis  <cit> . in addition, apoptosis of airway epithelium cells  has been reported as a mechanism for removing damaged cells to maintain aec function such as immune and inflammatory modulators  <cit> . it has also been suggested that aecs in response to different external invasions  can protect themselves  <cit> . however, the specific apoptosis pathway in ecp-induced human aec death remains unclear.

apoptosis, also called programmed cell death, is generally distinguished into two types--caspase-dependent and caspase-independent  <cit> --with the former being the major type. caspases belong to the cysteinyl aspartate protease family and are classified as effectors  and initiators  of programmed cell death. in addition, caspase- <dig> is reported to be an inflammatory caspase  <cit> . currently caspase-dependent apoptosis is divided into three pathways: two intrinsic mitochondria- and er-associated pathways  <cit>  and one extrinsic death receptor-initiated pathway  <cit> . mitochondrial membrane potential  represents a crucial check-point involving caspase- <dig>  which leads to apoptosis  <cit> . a current study showed that er stress response involved in caspase- <dig> could induce apoptosis  <cit> , and consequently the er stress-induced chaperones such as 78-kda glucose-regulated protein  were activated to rescue the cells. grp <dig> inhibits apoptotic signaling through er or non-er stress  <cit> . caspase-8-dependent apoptosis may be triggered by cell surface receptors belonging to the tumor gene superfamily, including cd <dig>   <cit> , tnf receptor- <dig>   <cit> , and tnf-related apoptosis-inducing ligand   <cit> . another mechanism for initiating the proteolytic cascade is induced by engagement of tnfr, fas/apo-1/cd <dig>  triggering caspase- <dig> activation by activated-caspase- <dig> without involvement of mitochondria  <cit> . regarding the ligand of tnfr, tnf-α, it has been reported to be released from epithelial cells  <cit>  and activated eosinophils  <cit> . moreover, it is known that poly  polymerase  is cleaved by caspase- <dig>  a downstream caspase of caspase- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  and causes cell apoptosis  <cit> .

in general, asthma patients have a higher concentration of ecp in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage, and sputum, along with tissue damage than healthy people  <cit> . severe damage and shedding are commonly observed in asthmatic airway epithelium  <cit> . therefore, understanding the mechanism of ecp-induced apoptosis might provide practical methods to treat asthma. here we intended to determine if beas-2b cell death occurred primarily due to apoptosis after ecp treatments, and verified the pathway involved in apoptotic cells.

RESULTS
recp causes cell death and apoptosis
the effect of recp on beas-2b cell viability was determined by the mtt assay. the recp was added to the cell culture at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm at 37°c for  <dig> h. recp inhibited cell viability with an ic <dig> of  <dig>  μm, and cell viability was rescued by general caspase inhibitor, z-vad-fmk . after co-incubation with recp, shrinkage and unattachment of the cells from culture plate were observed . beas-2b is a human bronchial epithelial cell line which is quite similar to primary cell. to determine whether such cell death was related to apoptosis, the nuclei were stained with hoechst  <dig> to monitor condensation of nuclear chromatin. bright spots in the recp-treated cells indicated nuclei undergoing chromatin condensation, strongly suggesting that beas-2b cells underwent apoptosis . here, apoptosis was also evaluated by staining with annexin v, a reagent commonly used to detect early apoptosis. beas-2b cells were treated with  <dig> μm recp for  <dig> h. the treated beas-2b cells showed  <dig>  ±  <dig> % apoptosis . besides, the characteristic dna fragmentation upon treatment with recp was observed . in comparison with untreated cells, the data indicated that beas-2b cells underwent early apoptosis after treatment with recp.

recp alters cell cycle distribution in beas-2b cells
dna damage is a general phenomenon in apoptotic cells and usually determined by sub-g <dig> cell cycle progression. to investigate whether caspase- <dig> and - <dig>  markers of mitochondria and er, respectively, were activated in beas-2b cells, specific pathway inducers were used as alternative apoptotic initiators for comparison. beas-2b cells were treated separately with  <dig>  μm staurosporin , a strong mitochondrial damage inducer, and  <dig> μm thapsigargin , a strong er response inducer, for  <dig> h and stained with pi prior to sub-g <dig> dna population analysis employing fluorescent-activated cell sorting  . the fraction of untreated control cells in sub-g <dig> was 2%, and that of cells treated with sts, recp and tg was increased significantly up to 36%, 9% and 7%. therefore, the increase of sub-g <dig> fraction in the individual treatments represented the cells undergoing apoptosis. here tg and sts were able to induce apoptosis in beas-2b cells through the er response and mitochondrial damage pathways, respectively.

recp induces apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner
in general, activation of the caspase cascade plays an important role in apoptosis. to identify possible involvement of caspases in ecp-induced apoptosis, beas-2b cells were treated with recp in the presence or absence of general caspase inhibitor z-vad-fmk and specific caspase- <dig> and - <dig> inhibitors, z-lehd-fmk and z-atad-fmk, respectively. the presence of cleaved poly  polymerase  was monitored to evaluate the degree of apoptosis. as compared with the control cells without drug treatment, apoptosis was clearly blocked by caspase inhibitors. the levels of cleaved parp decreased 92% upon pre-treatment with z-vad-fmk , suggesting that ecp-induced apoptosis proceeded via the caspase-dependent pathway. however, cells pre-treated with z-lehd-fmk  or z-atad-fmk  exhibited no effect upon treatment with recp, suggesting that caspase- <dig> and caspase- <dig> were not the major pathways involved in cell death triggered by recp.

recp induces er-independent apoptosis
the er response is generally triggered by environmental stress and sometimes leads to apoptosis. because grp <dig> plays a crucial role in the er response  <cit> , the level of grp <dig> expression in beas-2b cells treated with recp was assessed by western blotting and a de novo synthesis assay. accumulated and newly synthesized grp <dig> were detected using anti-grp <dig>  and metabolic labeling with methionine , respectively. the ratio of both accumulated and nascent grp <dig> to actin did not change during recp treatment. as for positive control, when the cells were treated with  <dig> μm tg, an er toxin, a 2- to 4-fold increase in accumulated grp <dig> after  <dig> to  <dig> h treatment was observed; moreover, newly synthesized grp <dig> revealed a 4- to 6-fold increase after  <dig> to  <dig> h under the same condition. taken together, these results implied that recp-induced apoptosis was er-independent, in consistence with the results of caspase- <dig> inhibitor treatment .

recp-induced apoptosis is not mitochondria-dependent
it has been reported that loss of mmp is involved in apoptosis  <cit> . to investigate whether mitochondrial events were involved in recp-induced apoptosis, mmp was measured by staining with mitotracker  and analyzed by facs. beas-2b cells treated with  <dig> μm sts, as a positive control, resulted in  <dig>  ± 9% mmp, indicating that approximately 40% of mitochondria were damaged. however, cells treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μm recp revealed mmp values of  <dig>  ±  <dig> % and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %, respectively, which did not substantially differ from the untreated control cells  . these results suggested that the caspase-9-dependent mitochondrial apoptotic pathway was not involved in recp-induced apoptosis, in agreement with the results of caspase- <dig> inhibitor treatment . moreover, cells treated with  <dig> and  <dig> μm recp did not alter cytochrome c release, strongly suggesting the notion that recp did not cause damage in mitochondria .

caspase- <dig> is involved in recp-induced apoptosis
caspase- <dig> is a downstream target of the death receptor-initiated pathway  <cit> . to identify possible involvement of caspases- <dig> in ecp-induced apoptosis, beas-2b cells were treated with recp in the presence or absence of caspase- <dig> inhibitor z-ietd-fmk. the levels of cleaved parp decreased 40% upon pre-treatment with z-ietd-fmk , suggesting that ecp-induced apoptosis proceeded possibly via the caspase-8-specific pathway. to examine caspase- <dig> and parp activation during recp-induced apoptosis, beas-2b cells were treated with  <dig> μm recp for  <dig> h. the presence of specific cleavage products of caspase- <dig> and parp were activated , suggesting that these precursors were activated and recp-induced apoptosis was indeed mediated by caspase- <dig> pathway in beas-2b cells.

to confirm that induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis was not derived from lipopolysaccharide, a contaminant often observed in recombinant proteins produced in e. coli, recp was treated with proteinase k  prior to addition to beas-2b cells. it was clear that no parp cleavage was generated in the presence of either heated recp or the pnk-treated recp mixture , strongly suggesting that apoptosis was indeed induced by recp itself but not by endotoxins or contaminants in the sample. moreover, mutant recp h15a/k38i/h128a , devoid of the rnase activity, also induced apoptosis, in consistent with the hypothesis that the rnase activity was not essential for cytotoxicity of ecp  <cit> .

recp-induced apoptosis is involved in tnf-α response
beas-2b cells treated with recp induced tnf-α production and release . secretion of tnf-α in the culture medium was monitored in beas-2b cells treated with recp for periods from  <dig> to  <dig> h , suggesting that tnf-α production in recp-treated cells was time-dependent. an elisa analysis showed that tnf-α accumulation in cell lysate of beas-2b cells significantly increased in those treated with recp after  <dig> h . the maximum of tnf-α production in the cells reached at  <dig> h . in addition, higher tnf-α level was detected in the supernatant of beas-2b cells treated with recp for  <dig> h than control cells  . in this study, we have found that mutant ecp lacking of rnase activity  can also induce tnf-α liberation; however, there is no significant increase of tnf-α liberation upon treating with rnase a .

previous results showed that eosinophils induced cells to undergo apoptosis accompanying with increasing tnf-α production  <cit> . to exclude the effect of tnf-α in recp-induced apoptosis in beas-2b cells, an anti-tnf-α antibody  was used to deplete tnf-α in the culture medium. when beas-2b cells were pre-treated with anti-tnf-α ab, the levels of cleaved parp significantly decreased to 22% . taken together, we have provided the first direct evidence that recp induced beas-2b cells to produce tnf-α, which in turn leads to apoptosis via caspase- <dig> dependent pathway.

discussion
aecs play an important role in protecting themselves from external invasion by forming a physical barrier. it has been reported that concentrations of ecp of the sputum is positively correlated with airway inflammation and asthma severity  <cit> , hence higher sputum ecp concentration up to μm level was detected in asthmatic patients  <cit> . the patches of denuded epithelium were observed in airway biopsies of asthmatic patients  <cit> . ecp and edn, having high sequence and structural similarity, are released from activated eosinophils. they inhibit the growth of hl- <dig> cells   <cit>  and kaposi's sarcomas cells  <cit> . although both ecp and edn induce apoptosis in cells, the mechanism has not been fully elucidated  <cit> . recently, ecp was shown to inhibit the viability of beas-2b cells as analyzed by mtt assay, but it has never been reported that ecp could cause apoptosis in beas-2b cells. our results of increase in chromatin condensation, sub-g <dig> population, parp cleavage, and dna fragmentation strongly indicate that ecp induces apoptosis in beas-2b cells. the study by trautmann et al. showed that recp-induced cell death via necrosis in bronchial epithelial cells , which might be attributed to high sensitivity to recp, and all recp-induced apoptotic cells activated signals to necrosis in ecs  <cit> . in addition, the study by nicotera et al. showed that apoptosis and necrosis death in cell were often intertwines; through apoptosis pathway, caspase activation could cause necrosis by promoting ion overload  <cit> . cell type specific response may account for different sensitivity to ecp and different stage of cells in our case. pre-treatment with general caspase inhibitor impedes ecp cytotoxicity, suggesting that ecp-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent. it has been known that mitochondrial damage, er response, and death receptor activation would trigger caspase-dependent apoptosis. hence three specific caspase  inhibitors were used to investigate the possible pathways during such caspase-dependent apoptosis. most apoptosis is linked to mitochondria-related damage, but pre-treatment with a caspase- <dig> inhibitor did not show any effect in our case. mmp and cytochrome c release experiments also confirmed this point. in addition, procaspase- <dig> cleavage to form active caspase- <dig> may take place if the er response has been activated  <cit> . although the study shows that human caspase- <dig> is regarded as a pseudogene because of losing function with several mutations  <cit> , saleh et al. have reported that caspase- <dig> shows natural polymorphism in ethnic groups of african descent  <cit> . in this study, pre-treatment with a caspase- <dig> inhibitor, metabolite labeling and western blotting for grp <dig> indicated that recp did not affect the er response. apparently recp-induced apoptosis was not involved in er response for the protein level of grp <dig> was not altered with or without ecp treatment. therefore, ecp-induced apoptosis was neither caspase- <dig> nor caspase- <dig> dependent. alternatively, the death receptor pathway which undergoes caspase- <dig> signal transduction, might be involved in ecp-induced apoptosis. caspase-8-dependent apoptosis may be triggered by cell surface death receptors such as tnfr and fas...etc.  <cit> . till now activation of the caspase- <dig> pathway in cells treated by eosinophils has never been reported. recently, ecp was proved to induce apoptosis undergoing caspase- <dig> like pathway  <cit> . however, no correlation with caspase- <dig> has been mentioned. in this study pre-treatment with caspase- <dig> inhibitor clearly demonstrated that apoptosis was mediated through caspase- <dig> activation, and cleavage of caspase- <dig> offered strong evidence to support this notion. this is the first study showing direct correlation between recp and caspase- <dig> activation in bronchial epithelial cells, which in turn results in cell apoptosis.

tnf-α or fasl may serve as the death ligands to aecs during caspase-8-dependent apoptosis and tnf-α has been reported to induce apoptosis in aecs  <cit> . it has also been known that both ecp and tnf-α are released from activated eosinophils  <cit>  epithelial cells release cytokines and growth factors such as il- <dig>  tnf-α and tgf-β under environmental stress to remove injured cells and recruit healthy cells  <cit> . however, there is no report indicating the correlation between recp and tnf-α liberation. trautmann et al. found that ifn-γ stimulated eosinophil lysate induced bronchial epithelial cells to undergo apoptosis  <cit>  tnf-α played an important role in ifn-γ stimulated eosinophil-induced apoptosis in bronchial epithelial cells, as evidenced by tnf-α antibody blocking experiment. besides, previous study showed that co-culture with house dust mite-activated eosinophils and airway bronchial epithelial cells induced tnf-α release; the inhibition experiment further indicated that p <dig> mapk and nf-κb were involved in tnf-α release in eosinophil-aecs system  <cit> . since ecp is the major component in eosinophils, it is possible that recp induced tnf-α production may also involve nf-κb and mapk pathways. here we hypothesized that up-regulated tnf-α, triggered by recp treatment, was released to external environment, where it killed cells via a feedback mechanism. in this way, the death receptor-triggered pathway would be stimulated to promote apoptosis. as a result, ecp might be recognized by cells as portending pathogen invasion, thereby inducing certain immune responses such as cytokine production and apoptosis. in this study, it found that the inactive rnase, mecp, could still induce tnf-α production, but highly active rnase a showed no significant tnf-α production, strongly suggesting that rnase activity did not correlated with tnf-α production .

tnf-α receptor activation triggered apoptosis can undergo either mitochondria-dependent pathway which is involved in tbid activation and triggers caspase- <dig> activation by releasing cytochrome c, or mitochondria-independent pathway  <cit> . in our study, caspase- <dig> inhibitor, mmp assays and cytochrome c release experiments all indicated that recp did not induce mitochondrial response, hence the apoptosis underwent mitochondria-independent pathway. previous study has reported that caspase- <dig> is able to activate caspase- <dig> and involved in mitochondrial response  <cit> . however, it was proved that ecp-induced apoptosis did not require mitochondrial response; hence we speculated that caspase- <dig> was activated by tnfr pathway instead of caspase- <dig>  taken together, figure  <dig> presents that ecp induces apoptosis involved in tnf-α-related caspase- <dig> activation through mitochondria-independent pathway.

although ecp belongs to the pancreatic-type rnase family  <cit> , its rnase activity is relatively weak. moreover, the rnase activity of ecp is not essential for its cytotoxicity  <cit> . ecp, edn, and rnase a  all belong to the pancreatic rnase family, and their rnase activities can be detected . as illustrated in our additional file  <dig>  ecp and mutant recp h15a/k38i/h128a with low or no rnase activity have higher toxicity toward beas-2b cells, whereas edn and rnase a with high rnase activity show no toxicity toward beas-2b cells. accordingly, our study also confirms that recp lacking of rnase activity retains cytotoxicity. on the contrary, human rnase a is highly enzymatically active in rna degradation but has no cytotoxicity. therefore, we suggest that the cytotoxicity of ecp is not correlated to the rnase activity.

onconase , one member of bullfrog rnase a superfamily, displays apoptosis to tumor cells via caspase- <dig> dependent but caspase- <dig> independent pathway  <cit> . different from onc, in this study, ecp triggers apoptosis via caspase- <dig> dependent but caspase- <dig> independent pathway. recently, onc was found to enter cells by clathrin-dependent endocytosis  <cit> . however, ecp endocytosed into beas-2b cells by non-clathrin but lipid raft-dependent macropinocytosis  <cit> . accordingly, we speculate that the mechanisms of toxic rnase endocytosis may activate different caspase pathways in target cells.

ecp endocytosis into beas-2b cells are facilitated by hspgs  <cit> . interestingly, hs was also detected on the surface of a <dig> cells   <cit> . consequently, we found that recp could induce apoptosis in a <dig> cells too . taken together, hs plays an important role in toxin endocytosis and triggering apoptosis in lung epithelial cells. through specific interaction between ecp and hs, ecp can target cancer cells that are rich in hs  <cit> . our results suggest that ecp-induced apoptosis might provide novel therapies for specific cancer cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we found that recp could inhibit beas-2b cell viability and induce apoptosis. increase of tnf-α in cells and medium, as well as cleavage of caspase- <dig> in beas-2b cells were detected after recp treatment. however, neither mmp nor er response was observed in the recp-induced apoptotic cells. in addition, caspase- <dig> and - <dig> inhibitor assays confirmed such speculation. thus, we clearly demonstrate that recp causes beas-2b cell apoptosis mainly through tnf-α-mediated caspase- <dig> specific pathway in a mitochondria-independent manner. the knowledge of this molecular basis is pivotal in understanding the development of pathogenesis in asthma and shed a light on potential therapeutic applications.
