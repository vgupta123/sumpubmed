BACKGROUND
a key question for biologists is: why do different geographic regions harbour contrasting levels of biodiversity? . oceanic archipelago floras provide striking examples of flowering plant lineages that have undergone extensive adaptive and allopatric diversification, with a high proportion of single island endemics  for example, the lobelioids in the hawaiian archipelago  <cit>  and the aeonium alliance in the canary islands  <cit> . however, the azores archipelago, part of the macaronesian region sensu dansereau  <cit>  that also comprises the cape verde, canaries, salvagems and madeira, represents an anomaly and shows a much lower proportion of sies when compared to other archipelagos  <cit> . furthermore, in the azores there are few examples of taxa that have diverged in situ, with 80 % of endemic lineages containing just a single endemic taxon; in the canaries, this figure is 56 % . this phenomenon was first alluded to by darwin in a letter to joseph hooker dated christmas day,  <dig>  where he commented on a recently published enumeration of the azores flora  <cit>  and noted: “watson’s paper on  azores has surprised me much; do you not think it odd, the fewness of peculiar species…?”  <cit> . carine and schaefer  <cit>  coined the term the ‘azores diversity enigma’  to collectively refer to these two distinctive features of the azores flora, i.e. the limited incidence of evolutionary radiations and paucity of sies in the flora.

hypotheses to explain the ade have included the proposal that the azorean islands, or the lineages inhabiting them, are too young for extensive radiations to have occurred - with ca. 62 % of the land area being less than  <dig> million years old , that they are too small in land surface area  <cit>  or that, in contrast to other archipelagos, the azorean islands are too ecologically homogeneous to have facilitated extensive diversification  <cit> . carine and schaefer  <cit>  suggested that these hypotheses do not satisfactorily explain the distinctive patterns in the azores, highlighting potential influence of inconsistent taxonomic effort or different palaeo-climate conditions on the evolution of their floras. schaefer et al.  <cit>  subsequently investigated genetic diversity patterns in ca. 20 % of azorean endemic lineages using the internal transcribed spacer region of nuclear ribosomal dna  sequences and found higher levels of molecular diversity and molecular sies compared to current taxonomic concepts. the authors concluded that the ade could indeed be a taxonomic artefact .

the genus pericallis  is endemic to macaronesia. with sixteen species and a distribution spanning the azores, canaries and madeira, it exemplifies the ade, since diversity in this genus is unevenly distributed across the region:  <dig> taxa occur in the canaries,  <dig> of which are sies, two sies occur in the madeira archipelago  <cit>  and one species with two multi-island endemic  subspecies occurs in the azores .fig.  <dig> geographic setting of the study archipelagos: azores and canaries in macaronesia  and islands of occupancy of pericallis lineages used in this study. islands: f, faial; p, pico; sj, são jorge; t, terceira; sm, são miguel; sa, santa maria; lp, la palma; eh, el hierro; lg, la gomera; te, tenerife. island ages are maximum ages in myr taken from caujapé-castells . taxa: ma, p. malvifolia subsp. malvifolia; ca, p. malvifolia subsp. caldeirae; pa, p. papyracea; mu, p. murrayi; st, p. steetzii; ec, p. echinata; cr, p. cruenta. a black circle is used to indicate the presence of the island graciosa, which does not host any populations of p. malvifolia and, therefore, was not sampled in this analysis. photos : p. malvifolia subsp. caldeirae, azores, são miguel, lagoa do fogo, photo credit: h. schaefer; p. malvifolia subsp. malvifolia, azores, são miguel, madrugada, collection: jones et al.  <dig>  photo credit: josé martins; p. echinata, canaries, tenerife, teno, collection: jones et al.  <dig>  photo credit: ke jones; p. cruenta, canaries, tenerife, la orotava, collection: jones et al.  <dig>  photo credit: ke jones




jones et al.  <cit>  identified two herbaceous lineages, namely the azorean lineage and a lineage comprising five sie species in the canaries that diverged recently ) and ca.  <dig>  ma  respectively). despite being of a similar age, the azorean and canarian lineages exhibit marked differences in their diversity patterns. the five sies of the canarian lineage  all exhibit broad and overlapping altitudinal and habitat ranges . in contrast, the two azorean endemic taxa are ecologically differentiated mies with overlapping island distributions: p. malvifolia subsp. malvifolia is restricted to low altitudes  on santa maria, são miguel, pico, faial and são jorge; p. malvifolia subsp. caldeirae is restricted to higher altitudes  and is found on são miguel, faial, terceira and pico  <cit> ; see fig.  <dig>  the azorean and canarian groups thus exhibit markedly different patterns that reflect the ade.

phylogenetic analyses of chloroplast and nuclear ribosomal its data provided only limited resolution within these clades but they did not support current taxonomic treatments in the azorean clade  <cit> . the two ecologically distinct azorean subspecies were not distinguished and the data were rather consistent with a pattern of geographic structuring across the azores. in the canarian lineage, little genetic differentiation was observed between the five currently recognized taxa with sharing of haplotypes evident between some taxa according to some of the markers used. whilst high morphological divergence with low sequence diversity is common in island radiations  <cit> , morphology-based species delimitation in the canarian lineage has been called into question with both nordenstam  <cit>  and swenson and manns  <cit>  suggesting that taxonomic concepts for pericallis need to be re-assessed.

the goal of this study is to understand the contrasting diversity patterns observed in the azores and canaries, focussing specifically on herbaceous pericallis lineages endemic to each archipelago. using morphology, amplified fragment length polymorphisms  and bioclimate data we test two hypotheses to explain the ade :  that differences are the result of taxonomic artefact or linnean shortfall resulting from the under description of taxa in the azores or the over-splitting of taxa in the canaries  <cit>  and  that differences are related to the greater ecological homogeneity of the azores  <cit> . we specifically assess patterns of morphological and molecular variation in the azorean and canarian herbaceous lineages, and investigate the relationship between morphological and molecular patterns of variation and geographical and ecological distance.table  <dig> hypotheses to explain the azores diversity enigma




RESULTS
morphological variation
in both the azores and canaries morphological analyses were generally consistent with current taxonomic classifications . in the azores, factor analysis for mixed data  of twelve variable morphological characters and  <dig> individuals revealed the separation of the two subspecies across dimensions one and two, although some overlap between ssp. malvifolia from the central islands and ssp. caldeirae was evident . the first dimension described  <dig>  % of the variation and the characters that contributed most significantly to this dimension  were the length of the highest bract and the indumentum of the disc cypselae . the second described  <dig>  % of the variation; the most significant character contributing to this dimension was the length of the disc floret corolla. there were also trends suggesting some geographic structuring within p. malvifolia subsp. malvifolia, since individuals from santa maria and são miguel showed some separation along the second dimension . however, individuals from the central islands overlapped with both santa maria and são miguel individuals. subsequent dimensions provided no useful information regarding differences among the populations investigated.fig.  <dig> factor analyses of mixed data of morphological variation , and principal component analyses of  <dig> bioclimatic variables for collection points  in each archipelago; azores  and canaries . each point represents an individual




in the canaries, the results of the famd analysis of  <dig> variable morphological characters and  <dig> individuals broadly agreed with current taxonomic treatments, although there was considerable overlap of p. steetzii and p. murrayi individuals and some overlap of p. echinata and p. steetzii accessions . the first dimension described  <dig>  % of the variation and mainly separated p. echinata from all other taxa. the characters that contributed most to this dimension are related to capitulum size and length of scales on the phyllary bracts: p. echinata exhibits longer disc and ray floret corolla tubes with longer and more abundant scales on the phyllary bracts compared to all other taxa. pericallis papyraceus was also separated from all other taxa along the first dimension; the character that distinguished it along this dimension was the smaller capitulum width. pericallis cruenta was separated from p. papyraceus, p. steetzii and p. murrayi along the second dimension, which described  <dig>  % of the variation . the character that contributed most significantly to this dimension and separated p. cruenta from all other taxa was abaxial leaf indumentum colour: p. cruenta typically exhibits purple abaxial leaf indumentum, whereas p. papyraceus, p. steetzii and p. murrayi are green to white. with the exception of a strong contribution of the number of the ray florets to the differentiation of p. papyraceus  from all other taxa , subsequent dimensions provided no useful information regarding the differences amongst the populations investigated. non-parametric permutational multivariate analyses of variance  of morphological data in the azores revealed a significant difference between taxa and islands . r <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for the analyses of variation between species and between islands, respectively . permanova of pericallis morphological data in the canaries revealed a significant difference between taxa and islands . r <dig> values were  <dig>  and  <dig>  for analyses between species and between islands respectively .table  <dig> results of permutational analysis of variance of pericallis morphological data to assess significant differences between islands and taxa in the azores and canaries




bioclimatic variation
nineteen bioclimatic variables from the geographic locations of  <dig> individuals in the azores available through worldclim  were analysed using principal component analysis . a number of clusters were separated along the first and second axis . these corresponded to  santa maria subsp. malvifolia  são miguel subsp. malvifolia  central sub-archipelago subsp. malvifolia,  são miguel subsp. caldeirae and  central sub-archipelago subsp. caldeirae . pc <dig> explained a much higher percentage of the variation than pc <dig> . the most significant ecological variables that contributed to pc <dig> were all related to precipitation ; those contributing to pc <dig> were precipitation of the driest quarter and the driest month and isothermality .

the pca of bioclimatic variation in the canaries for  <dig> georeferenced individuals showed some separation of the currently recognized taxa: p. cruenta and p. murrayi were distinguished, although p. echinata individuals overlapped with some individuals of p. cruenta. significant overlap was found between p. steetzii and p. murrayi accessions . the most significant ecological variables that contributed to pc <dig>  which explained  <dig>  % of the variation were all related to temperature ; those contributing to pc <dig>  were isothermality, mean diurnal range and annual temperature range .

spatial structuring of genetic variation
seventy-six samples of the azorean p. malvifolia were used for aflp fingerprinting analysis,  <dig> of which were also used in the morphometric analysis. this sampling encompassed populations of both subspecies on all islands where they occur. a discriminant analysis of principal components  was used to assign individuals to genetic clusters  <cit>  with selection of the optimal number of clusters based on the bayesian information criterion . the results of the k-means clustering analyses of the azorean aflp data suggested that the best k value was  <dig> . no genetic differentiation between p. malvifolia subsp. malvifolia and subsp. caldeirae was apparent . rather, there was geographical structuring with the three groups largely restricted to the central sub-archipelago, são miguel, and santa maria, respectively; albeit with some genetic material shared between the groups. hierarchical analyses of molecular variance   <cit>  were used to investigate partitioning of variation within and among the groups defined by the dapc analysis. the amova results suggested that there was greater variation within than between groups .fig.  <dig> discriminant analysis of principal components showing the genetic clustering of populations of pericallis lineages analysed in the azores and canaries based on aflp data. each bar represents one individual plant.   <dig> individuals from the azores . pericallis malvifolia subsp. malvifolia is separated into different island groupings: central island subsp. malvifolia and eastern island subsp. malvifolia. taxon names and island groupings are indicated above the plot. island names are indicated below the plot and separated by bold lines.   <dig> individuals from the canaries . taxon names are indicated above the plots and island names are indicated below the plot separated by bold lines





for the canarian dataset,  <dig> samples were used to represent the five taxa recognised. forty-four of the samples were also used in the morphometric analysis. in the dapc analysis, the most likely k values were k = 3– <dig>  but the differences between the bic values for these were marginal. we present the dapc plot for k =  <dig> to reflect the number of taxa currently recognized and the results from cp and its sequence data in jones et al. ; this reveals a pattern that broadly corresponded to the currently accepted taxa but with more sharing of genetic material between taxa than in the azorean dataset . for k =  <dig>  geographic structuring between islands was observed and for k =  <dig>  very little geographic structure was apparent . as with the azorean dataset, amova suggested that there was greater variation within groups defined by the dapc analysis than between groups but genetic differentiation between groups was lower in the canaries than for the azorean data set .

in the azores, a full distance-based redundancy analyses  revealed a significant positive correlation between geographic distance and genetic distance but no significant correlation between geographical and morphological distance . there were significant correlations between genetic distance and climate pc <dig> and pc <dig>  however, partial dbrda, which allows for the fitting of covariates to account for potential confounding effects of these values  <cit> , suggested that climate pc <dig> and pc <dig> were not significant for aflp data variation in the azores when geographic distance was taken into account. morphological distance was not correlated with climate pc <dig> in the full dbrda analysis, but was correlated with climate pc <dig>  in the partial analysis where geographic distance was taken into account, significant correlations were observed between morphological variation and both climate pc <dig> and pc <dig> .table  <dig> relationships between genetic and morphological diversity of pericallis and geographic distance  and pc <dig> and pc <dig> of the principle coordinate analysis of bioclimatic data using distance-based redundancy analyses. left: full tests of individual sets. right: partial tests

in the canaries, full dbrda revealed significant positive correlations between both geographic distance and genetic distance, and geographical distance and morphological distance . full dbrda suggested significant correlations between genetic distance and climate pc <dig>  a significant correlation between morphological distance and climate pc <dig> and climate pc <dig> was also observed. however, when geographic distance was taken into account in the partial dbrda, no significant correlations between genetic distance and morphological or bioclimatic variables were observed.

discussion
the low numbers of sies in the azores relative to other oceanic islands was noted by darwin  <cit> , and was recently termed the ‘azores diversity enigma’  <cit> . we aimed to test hypotheses that explain the ade by comparing patterns of endemicity observed in azorean and canarian pericallis lineages that are endemic to each archipelago. we specifically tested two hypotheses :  the linnean shortfall hypothesis  <cit>  and  the environmental homogeneity hypothesis  <cit> .

hypothesis 1: linnean shortfall in the azores
the linnean shortfall hypothesis – the failure to recognise morphologically differentiated taxa in the azores or over-splitting of taxa in the canaries – does not adequately explain the ade for pericallis, contrary to the suggestion of schaefer et al.  <cit>  and carine et al.  <cit>  that this may explain the distinctive patterns in the azores flora more generally. differences between taxa significantly explained morphological variation of pericallis in the canaries  with species circumscriptions in the canaries also broadly supported by famd analysis of morphological variation. however, p. steetzii and p. murrayi were not differentiated in the famd analysis, which suggests some level of over-splitting  but not enough to adequately explain the ade. we also observed a significant correlation between morphological and geographical distance, with differences between islands explaining 43 % of the morphological variation. this is consistent with the recognition of sies, even though considerable morphological variation exists within islands, as is evident from the space occupied by taxa in the famd analysis . similarly, the famd analysis of morphological variation in the azores broadly supported current taxon delimitation, largely differentiating between the low altitude subsp. malvifolia and the high altitude subsp. caldeirae . the permanova analysis revealed that morphological variation was better explained by differences between islands  than by differences between subspecies . however, there are two morphological characters that are markedly distinct between subspecies, namely disc cypselae indumentum and length of the highest bract. populations of subsp. malvifolia from santa maria and são miguel show some morphological differentiation according to the famd that is not reflected in current treatments  and that largely reflects differences in disc floret corolla length and stamen length. however, this variation is subsumed within the range of morphological variation exhibited by the central group subsp. malvifolia, which precludes its taxonomic recognition. the larger morphological variation found between islands in the azores according to permanova may reflect the combined effect of  <dig>  the morphological differences between santa maria and são miguel and  <dig>  the morphological differences between subspecies caldeirae restricted to the central islands and subsp. malvifolia that occurs on both central and eastern island groups.

in contrast to the situation in the canaries, there was no correlation between morphological and geographical distance in the azores . this is in contrast to the situation in some other azorean plant groups, where recent taxonomic revision has resulted in the recognition of geographically restricted endemic taxa . analyses of patterns of morphological variation in pericallis therefore suggest that past failures to recognise morphologically distinct taxa in the azores do not appear to be an explanation for the lack of sies in azorean pericallis even though it may be significant in other groups.

hypothesis 2: ecological homogeneity in the azores
ecology would appear to be an important factor associated with diversification in both archipelagos. both azorean and canarian lineages exhibited ecological differentiation between currently recognized taxa, although differentiation was greater between the azorean taxa . furthermore, variation in morphology was correlated with climate and geographical distance in both the canaries and the azores . in the canarian lineage, species exhibited broad ecological ranges but ecological differentiation between species is nevertheless observed in the pca analysis . morphology was correlated with both pc <dig> and pc <dig> of the climate analysis, although this result was highly influenced by the effect of geographical distance . the azorean pattern of climatic differentiation was similarly consistent with morphological differentiation, yet with greater clustering in the bioclimatic pca compared to the famd based on morphological data . it is notable that most of the variation in climate  was explained by the first axis of the pca analysis. along axis pc <dig>  all subsp. caldeirae individuals, with the exception of one individual from são miguel were differentiated from subsp. malvifolia. populations of subsp. malvifolia from santa maria, são miguel and the central group were also differentiated in the pca of climatic data. whilst morphology showed no correlation with geographical distance, it was correlated with climate pc <dig>  and strongly so according to the partial dbrda when geographical distance was taken into account . the results therefore suggest that shifts in bioclimatic preference across an ecologically heterogeneous island system are associated with the morphological diversification of pericallis groups in both the azores and the canaries. in both archipelagos, there are more floral than leaf characteristics accounting for the morphological differentiation between the bio-climatically distinct pericallis taxa, for example, cypselae indumentum of the disc florets between the ecologically and attitudinally distinct p. malvifolia subspecies in the azores. these traits are not obviously adaptive, a situation in contrast to some other island radiations studied wherein variation has been observed in leaf characters, for example, plantago in hawaii  <cit>  and lavandula in the canary islands  <cit> . the worldclim model interpolates from weather station observations using latitude, longitude and elevation. therefore, there may be limitations in the reliability of the bio-climatic data, particularly in regions with varied topography such as oceanic archipelagos  <cit> . despite this, we identify clear bioclimatic patterns in the case of pericallis in the azores and canaries at odds with the ecological homogeneity hypothesis  <cit> . in order to further test the ecological homogeneity hypothesis put forward by triantis et al.  <cit> , it would be informative to measure and compare the levels of ecological opportunity between taxa in the azores and canaries and test the associations with adaptive radiations. this would, for example, require an assessment of potential key innovations and the colonization of new habitats and subsequent ecological release such as in the form of increased population size or broader habitat use  <cit> . these measures are difficult to obtain but mechanistic frameworks that simulate these processes are currently been developed .

what does explain the ade-like pattern for pericallis?
a key difference between pericallis diversity patterns in the two archipelagos concerns the relationship between morphological and molecular  data. we observe isolation by distance  for aflp data in both archipelagos . in the canary islands aflp data showed some congruence with current taxonomic treatments although with sharing of genetic material evident between taxa. in the azores, three aflp groups were defined, broadly corresponding to the central group, são miguel, and santa maria , a pattern that was incongruent with the recognised subspecies. these findings are similar to schaefer et al.  <cit>  who observed genetically differentiated sies in a suite of apparently widespread azorean endemic lineages.

a smaller proportion of the aflp variation was explained by between-island differences in the canaries than in the azores , and there was greater sharing of genetic material between islands in the canaries than between santa maria, são miguel and the central island group in the azores. thus, aflp data suggest a stronger geographical signal in the azores than in the canaries, and the aflp pattern in the azores is at odds with the pattern observed with morphology whereas aflp data and morphology are broadly congruent in the canaries. several factors may explain the differences. the generally smaller population sizes in the azores than in the canaries, partly influenced by anthropogenic factors such as habitat destruction, may have led to stronger genetic structuring. while populations in santa maria and, to a lesser extent, são miguel may be large, those in the central group of the azores are typically comprised of less than  <dig> individuals; in the canaries, populations are often extensive. geographic isolation between populations is a second factor that may explain the greater geographical structuring of aflp data in the azores. colonization of a new island is the result of a combination of dispersal and establishment. pericallis achenes are wind dispersed  that likely facilitates long distance dispersal to islands  <cit> , yet the predominant dispersal syndromes observed in different island floras appear to be highly idiosyncratic  <cit> . geographic distance is critical in the process of colonization and therefore, greater geographic distance between islands may facilitate inter-island diversification  <cit> . in the canaries, the maximum distance between two neighbouring islands on which herbaceous pericallis occur is ~60 km. in the azores, the distances between santa maria and são miguel  and between são miguel and the central group  are both greater, and this is likely to promote greater genetic differentiation by geographic isolation . within the azorean central island group, wherein all except one accession are placed in the same genetic cluster, the islands are generally in closer proximity than in the canaries  and this may explain the lack of differentiation between populations on these islands. terceira is a notable exception; at 39 km from são jorge it is more isolated than the islands of tenerife and la gomera in the canaries . the lack of differentiation of terceira populations from other central sub-archipelago populations was also observed in genetic diversity analyses of the endemic picconia azorica  <cit> , but the island has been found to harbour distinct genetic lineages in other taxa  <cit> .

in the canaries, molecular and morphological diversity were both correlated with geographical distance and climatic variation . however, geographical distance and climate were themselves correlated . thus, morphologically differentiated clusters in the canarian lineage tend to be both geographically isolated and climatically differentiated . the group may therefore be considered to be an example of a classic island adaptive radiation, within which geographical isolation and ecological differentiation have acted in concert in the diversification of the group  <cit> . in a review of molecular phylogenies of island lineages, baldwin et al.  <cit>  concluded that inter-island allopatry was an important driver of diversification in the canaries given that closely related taxa often occupy apparently similar habitats but on different islands. our results for canarian pericallis suggest that the closely related and recently diverged taxa occupy broadly similar habitats but there is some evidence for bio-climatically differentiation between taxa that may have further contributed to their diversification. other putative examples of ‘inter-island allopatry’ in the canaries may also involve ecological differentiation .

in the azores, morphology showed no correlation with geographical distance but was correlated with climate when the possible noise caused by geographical distance was taken into account in the partial dbrda . in contrast, aflp data were not correlated with climate when geographical distance was taken into account. thus, molecular patterns appear to reflect island isolation and genetic drift  whereas the morphological patterns reflect ecological differentiation. the latter has involved shifts between climatic zones that have occurred within islands or island groups at least twice in parallel in the central group and in são miguel. therefore, in contrast to the canaries, the effects of geographic isolation and ecological differentiation in azorean pericallis are uncorrelated.

the independent origins of the high altitude subsp. caldeirae ‘morphotype’ on separate islands in the central group and são miguel may reflect underlying phenotypic plasticity, i.e. the property of a genotype to express distinct phenotypes in different environments  <cit> . the role of phenotypic plasticity in diversification is widely debated . however, phenotypic plasticity provides opportunities for diversification, including ecological adaptation and speciation  <cit> . the maintenance of morphological differences in spite of limited genetic differentiation between taxa could also reflect strong ecological selection on few loci of large effect that are not detected by the aflp analyses due to limited genome coverage . recent studies have also provided evidence for ecological divergence correlating with epigenetic changes in dna methylation  <cit> . the potential role of epigenetics in generating phenotypic plasticity in the diversification of recently evolved oceanic island lineages has yet to be explored and may be significant.

incongruence between molecular and morphological patterns may reflect a more general pattern in the azorean flora. for example, euphorbia stygiana subsp. stygiana shows geographical structuring of molecular data yet morphological differences to support this have not been identified  <cit> . molecular studies of the azorean ammi lineage  <cit>  and azorean juniperus  <cit>  have demonstrated geographically structured patterns that are incongruent with morphology. it is important to note that although our sampling ensured a broad distributional range and included almost all known pericallis populations in both archipelagos, the number of samples with both morphological and genetic data was limited . therefore, future studies with an increased number of individuals per population may help further explain the patterns.

CONCLUSIONS
overall, our results suggest that the paucity of morphologically defined sies in azorean pericallis when compared to the canaries is not simply the result of a linnean shortfall. furthermore, ecological diversification of taxa is observed in both archipelagos. in the canaries, the correlation between isolation and ecological differentiation results in a classic island adaptive radiation in which we observe geographically isolated morphologically differentiated taxa, even though the molecular data suggest some gene flow. the azorean lineage, within which morphology and molecular data are not congruent, does not conform to this pattern. the results of this study are at odds with the recent discovery of new endemic taxa in other azorean plant lineages  <cit> . taken together, recent work on the azores flora suggest that its distinctiveness that was first commented on by darwin reflects both a lack of taxonomic effort but also differences between archipelagos in the geographical and ecological context for diversification.
