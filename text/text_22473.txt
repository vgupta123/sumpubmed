BACKGROUND
sorbitol dehydrogenase  is commonly found in all kinds of life forms, including animals  <cit> , yeasts  <cit> , bacteria  <cit>  and plants  <cit> . it represents the early divergence within the nad -dependent medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase  superfamily , sharing a distant homology with alcohol dehydrogenase   <cit> . sdh catalyses the reversible oxidation of a range of related sugar alcohols into their corresponding ketoses  <cit> , preferring polyols with a d-cis- <dig> -dihydroxyl  configuration and a c <dig> hydroxyl group next to the oxidation site at c <dig>  such as sorbitol, xylitol and ribitol . it exhibits the highest activity on sorbitol while also being able to oxidize the other polyols at lower reaction rates  <cit> . the process of sorbitol oxidation by human sdh requires a catalytic zinc atom which is coordinated by the side chains of three amino acids  and one water molecular. nad+ binds to the protein first, followed by sorbitol. the backbone of sorbitol stacks against the nicotinamide ring while the c <dig> and c <dig> oxygen atoms are coordinated to the zinc. the water molecule coordinating the zinc atom acts a general base and abstracts the proton of the c <dig> hydroxyl, which creates an electron flow to nad+, leading to the oxidation of sorbitol at c <dig> and the final production of nadh  <cit> .

plant sdh is the key enzyme in the sorbitol metabolism pathway  <cit>  and has been associated with resistance to abiotic stresses such as drought and salinity. sdh activity regulates the levels of polyols  <cit> , which act as important osmolytes during drought stress and recovery processes  <cit> . in rosaceae species sorbitol occurs as the major photosynthate and phloem transported carbohydrate  <cit> . in these plants, which include apple  <cit> , pear  <cit>  and loquat  <cit> , sdh plays a crucial role in the oxidation of sorbitol and its translocation to sink tissues such as developing fruits and young leaves. gene transcript level and enzyme activity remain high during fruit development and maturation, dropping gradually in later stages, and contributing to the sugar accumulation in the ripening fruits  <cit> . the role of sink strength regulation for sdh is of particular research interest given the economic importance of these fruit species. additionally, sdh has been shown to be involved in the sugar metabolism process during seed germination of some herbaceous plants including soybean  <cit>  and maize  <cit> .

despite efforts to understand the physiological role of sdh in plants, little attention has been paid toward the evolutionary history of the plant sdh gene family. the distribution of the sdh genes in higher plants appears to be species-dependant. in particular,  <dig> paralogous sdh genes have been reported in apple  <cit>  and  <dig> in japanese pear  <cit> . in contrast, other plant genomes such as a. thaliana  <cit> , tomato  <cit>  and strawberry  <cit>  contain only one sdh gene. recent studies have indicated that there are two groups of sdh present in some rosaceae plants. park et al.  <cit>  isolated four sdh isoforms  from fuji apple and found that mdsdh2- <dig> could be clearly distinguished from mdsdh <dig> based on the deduced amino acid sequence, showing 69–71% identity with mdsdh <dig> and 90–92% identity with each other. in addition, mdsdh2- <dig> were expressed only in sink tissues such as young leaves, stems, roots and maturing fruits while mdsdh <dig> was highly expressed in both sink and source organs  <cit> . nosarzewski et al.  <cit>  identified nine sdhs  from the borkh apple genome and showed that all isoforms except sdh <dig>  were highly homologous with an identity of 91–97%. similar observations have been made with the sdh isoforms  identified in pear whereby ppysdh <dig> differed from ppysdh1- <dig> at both the primary structure level and the gene transcriptional level  <cit> . preliminary phylogenetic analyses have classified these homologous sdhs into two groups based on primary protein structures  <cit> . however, these studies focused on only one or just a few related rosaceae species. no comprehensive phylogenetic analysis has been performed on sdh across a broad range of angiosperm species.

gene duplication is widespread in plant genomes. functional divergence after gene duplication is the major mechanism by which genes with novel function evolve; this phenomenon plays a key role in the evolution of phenotypic diversity  <cit> . the current understanding of gene evolution via duplication suggests that duplicated genes could arise through different mechanisms including unequal crossing over , retrotransposition, segmental duplication and chromosomal  duplication  <cit> . most duplicated genes are lost due to the accumulation of mutations that render them non-functional   <cit> . however, they can be retained under certain circumstances whereby the acquisition of beneficial mutations leads to novel function , which requires positive natural selection, or through adoption of part of the functions of the ancestral gene , which could occur by expression divergence or functional specialization of protein  <cit> . the latter usually involves a shift in the enzyme substrate specificity.

protein structural analyses have shown that the lidh of v. vinifera, which catalyses the inter-conversion of l-idonate and 5-keto-d-gluconate  in the tartaric acid  synthesis pathway  <cit> , is highly homologous to plant sdhs, sharing ~77% amino acid sequence similarity with sdh from tomato  and a. thaliana   <cit> . the  <dig> amino acid lidh  contains an n-terminal groes-like fold and a c-terminal rossmann fold  <cit> , characteristics of the adh family  <cit> , which has a distant homology to sdh  <cit> . however, unlike other plant sdhs, lidh displays principal activity against l-idonate and has a low reaction rate with sorbitol  <cit> . the unique substrate specificity of lidh was suggested to be due to small changes in amino acid sequence encoded by paralogous genes  <cit> .

in this study, a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of angiosperm sdhs was conducted using currently available genomic data. a computational approach was employed to characterise the natural selection pressure on plant sdh. the protein structures of the sdh homologues in v. vinifera were modelled based on human sdh  to identify the putative active site residues of plant sdhs. transcription and co-expression data of sdh genes were also extracted from recent publicly available microarray and co-expression databases and analysed. new insights into the evolution history of the plant sdh family and the evolutionary origin of v. vinifera lidh will be discussed.

RESULTS
identification of sorbitol dehydrogenase  homologous genes in higher plants
a database homology search identified  <dig> sdh homologous genes from  <dig> species . at least one putative sdh gene was present in each plant genome studied, consistent with previous studies  <cit>  that suggested the ubiquity of sdh and its functional importance across all life forms. however, the distribution of sdh homologous genes varied dramatically across species. monocot species  uniformly presented a single sdh gene, and this same observation was made with brassicaceae plants  from the eudicot group. it was recently reported that there are  <dig> sdh genes in both rice  and a.thaliana   <cit> , however, in both cases these sdh genes were found to be alternative transcripts of a single gene. all except one species from the asterid clade and the leguminosae family had one sdh gene, the exceptions being solanum tuberosum  and glycine max , respectively, which both had two copies. by contrast, numerous copies of sdh genes were found in rosaceae species, which employ sorbitol as the major transported carbohydrate  <cit> . malus × domestica  contained  <dig> putative sdh genes, the highest number among all species investigated. a previous study  <cit>  identified  <dig> sdh genes in the apple genome, however, the extra putative sdh  was only a partial gene  and was excluded from the present study. in addition to apple, other rosaceae species such as prunus persica , prunus mume , eriobotrya japonica  and pyrus bretschneideri  had  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> putative sdh genes respectively. it should be noted that the information of sdh numbers in loquat  <cit>  and pear  <cit>  was retrieved from earlier reports, and that more sdh genes may be found when complete genome data for these species become available. although fragaria vesca  belongs to the rosaceae family, only one sdh gene was present in this species. unlike other rosaceae fruit species, f. vesca utilizes sucrose instead of sorbitol as the main translocated carbohydrate  <cit> . according to a recent development in the evolution by duplication theory, a proper gene dosage should be kept to maintain a stoichiometric balance in macromolecular complexes such as functional proteins, thereby ensuring the normal functioning of a particular biological process  <cit> . transportation and assimilation of sorbitol is a rosaceae-specific metabolism. the retention of highly duplicated sdh genes in rosaceae species suggests that a higher dosage of sdh transcription or enzyme activity is needed to facilitate sorbitol metabolism in these species.figure  <dig> distribution of sdh homologous genes in higher plants. closely related species were specified accordingly. the gene abundance heat map was based on the total copy number of sdh genes in each species. sdhs of p. bretschneideri  <cit>  and e. japonica   <cit>  were obtained from literature; additional sdhs may be identified in these two species when complete genome information becomes available. the classification of sdh class i and sdh class ii was based on the phylogenetic analysis carried out in the present study.



three putative sdh genes were identified in the v. vinifera genome. one  corresponded to the previously characterized lidh   <cit>  while the other two shared 99%  and 77%  amino acid sequence identity with v. vinifera lidh . other important crops such as c. sinensis , theobroma cacao , and pelargonium hortorum  had  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> sdh genes respectively. p. hortorum and s. tuberosum are of particular interest in this study because they have also been shown to accumulate significant levels of ta, like v. vinifera  <cit> . another species that should be noted is aquilegia coerulea , which belongs to the eudicot family but has been recognized as an evolutionary intermediate  <cit>  between monocot and core eudicot plants, and contained  <dig> sdh paralogues.

phylogenetic analysis of plant sorbitol dehydrogenase families
to determine the evolutionary history of plant sdh family and the phylogenetic relationship between lidh and sdh, a phylogeny of the sdh family was reconstructed. consistent results were obtained using both neighbour joining  and maximum likelihood  methods. as can be seen in the maximum likelihood tree , the target proteins divided at the basal nodes into three major clusters, corresponding to the three life kingdoms: fungi, animal and plant . the overall topology of the plant sdh clade was in agreement with the phytozome species tree , indicating that the phylogeny results were reliable. specifically, monocot plants  formed a single clade with strong support , corresponding to the early split between monocot and dicot lineages. a. coerulea sdhs separated into a single group  which positioned itself between monocot and core eudicot plants. the aquilegia genus belongs to the eudicot order ranunculales which has been established as a sister clade to the rest of the core eudicot  <cit>  and agrees with the present phylogenetic analysis.figure  <dig> phylogenetic tree showing the evolutionary history of the angiosperm sdh family. a: a simplified schematic phylogeny of the sdh family inferred by mega  <dig>   <cit>  software using the neighbour joining method. values  of internal branch test  supports are indicated above the corresponding branches. b: the maximum likelihood phylogeny of the sdh family developed by mega  <dig>   <cit>  software using the selected best-fitting substitution model jtt + g  <cit> .  <dig> times bootstraping supports  are displayed above corresponding branch. closely related species are annotated accordingly. the v. vinifera lidh  is also marked.



the core eudicot sdhs split into two distinct lineages in the maximum likelihood tree . the first lineage  covered all core eudicot species included in this study while the second  had a narrower coverage and was less expanded compared to sdh class i. the divergence of core eudicot sdhs into two lineages was in agreement with previous reports that sdhs from some rosaceae species could be separated into two groups  <cit> . all rosaceae plants  investigated in this study except f. vesca  had multiple copies of sdh genes that covered both sdh class i and sdh class ii. however, within these species, the distribution of sdhs among the two sdh classes varied greatly. in particular,  <dig> out of the  <dig> sdhs from m. domestica and  <dig> out of the  <dig> sdhs from p. bretschneideri fell into sdh class i while  <dig> out of the  <dig> sdhs from p. persica and  <dig> out of the  <dig> sdhs from p. mume belonged to sdh class ii. other species retaining two classes of sdhs included s. tuberosum, v. vinifera, eucalyptus grandis, c. sinensis, t. cacao, p. hortorum, populus trichocarpa, linum usitatissimum, jatropha curcas and manihot esculenta, from different orders or families. in contrast, brassicaceae plants , leguminosae plants  and asterid plants  except s. tuberosum contained either a single sdh or two sdhs that could only be classified into sdh class i. within both sdh class i and class ii clades, rosaceae sdhs  formed separate phylogeny groups , implying divergent molecular characteristics for sdhs from this family. most recent phylogenetic analyses  <cit>  have placed vitaceae as a sister clade to the rosid plants in the core eudicot group. the presence of two classes of sdhs in both v. vinifera and s. tuberosum  indicated that the divergence between sdh class i and class ii occurred before the species radiation of the core eudicot plants. moreover, although  <dig> sdh genes were retained in the genome of the evolutionarily intermediate species a. coerulea, none of them could be classified into sdh class i or sdh class ii. taken together, our results suggested that sdh class i and class ii might have diverged during the common ancestor of core eudicot plants but after the branching of the basal eudicots such as ranunculales. this corresponds to a period of about 125mya ~ 115mya  <cit> .

in the maximum likelihood tree, the class ii clade was well-supported and separated from class i with longer branch length in general , suggesting a higher level of amino acid substitution within this clade. in addition, the topology of the class ii clade  was in good agreement with the species tree at phytozome , with s. tuberosum  diverging first followed by v. vinifera and the rest of the rosid species. this indicates that the class ii sdhs have evolved vertically within respective species, which lends further support to the suggestion above that sdh class i and class ii have existed during the common ancestry of core eudicot plants. the backbone topology of the more inclusive class i clade in the maximum likelihood tree was weakly supported , in contrast with the strong clustering support for this clade in the neighbour joining tree . the weak bootstrap support for the topology of sdh class i may have resulted from a lack of amino acid substitution in this clade, as reflected by the short branch length . the calculation of evolutionary distances for plant sdhs revealed a pair-wise distance under  <dig>  in general , sequence alignment showed that class i sdhs tend to be more conserved  than class ii , which means less amino acid substitution within the class i clade. these results are consistent with the strong clustering support for the major sub-clades of the class i branch in the neighbour joining tree .table  <dig>

sdh sequences were divided into six groups  according to the phylogenetic analysis carried out in the present study . the amino acid sequence identity  was obtained using all-vs-all blast tool. the average pair-wise identity between each group is presented, followed by the identity range .



in contrast to the ubiquity of class i sdhs, the absence of class ii sdhs in some species may be due to gene loss after duplication, a common mechanism in gene evolution via duplication  <cit> . this also indicated that sdh class ii members may not be essential for the normal growth of plants, suggesting a divergent function for this class of sdh genes. interestingly, the previously characterized v. vinifera lidh   <cit>  was grouped into sdh class ii, providing direct support that in at least one case sdh class ii may have acquired a novel function, in this instance its involvement in the synthesis of ta. while the identity of additional functions for class ii sdhs in other species is unknown, support for a role of some class ii sdhs in ta metabolism may be proposed. only a few plant families, including vitaceae, geraniaceae and leguminosae have been shown to accumulate significant levels of ta  <cit>  and the present results showed that class ii sdhs were present in both vitaceae and geraniaceae. the absence of class ii sdhs in leguminosae plants could be explained by the fact that the synthesis of ta in leguminosae proceeds via a different pathway, which bypasses the interconversion of l-idonate and 5kga   <cit> . recent studies have revealed that potato  <cit> , citrus fruits  <cit>  and pear  <cit>   also produce ta, although to a lesser degree than v. vinifera. this is consistent with the potential correlation between class ii sdhs and ta synthesis. however, it has also been reported that ta is absent or found only in trace amount in apple  <cit> , and no information is available about the occurrence of ta in peach even though three copies of class ii sdh genes were identified in this species . it is possible that class ii sdhs have evolved varied functions to meet the different environmental challenges faced by respective plants. in this context, it would also be valuable for future work to investigate the in-planta function of sdh and the occurrence of ta in the evolutionarily intermediate plant a.coerulea, for which  <dig> sdh paralogues were identified.

sequence alignment and protein subdomain analysis
sequence alignment and protein subdomain analyses were performed to investigate the molecular characteristics of plant sdhs. results showed that plant sdhs shared an overall identity above 67% , while having ca 48% and ca 41% identities with mammal and yeast sdhs respectively . plant sdhs were clustered into four groups in the present phylogenetic analysis: monocot sdh, a. coerulea sdh, core eudicot sdh class i and sdh class ii. protein blast results showed that class i and class ii sdhs within the same species generally had an inter-class identity of around 70% and an intra-class identity above 90% . when compared with monocot and a. coerulea sdhs, class i sdhs always demonstrated a significantly higher similarity than class ii sdhs , suggesting that core eudicot class i sdhs have a closer distance to monocot and a. coerulea sdhs and that sdh class ii may have diverged from sdh class i. in addition, class i sdhs tend to be more homologous than class ii sdhs . no significant difference between the two sdh classes was observed when compared to mammal or yeast sdhs . protein functional domain prediction identified two functional domains for plant sdhs: an n-terminal groes-like fold and a c-terminal rossmann fold . secondary structure analysis showed that these two domains tended to be highly conserved among all plant sdhs, and amino acid substitutions mainly occurred at boundary regions linking secondary structural elements such as alpha-helices and beta-sheets .figure  <dig> multiple sequence alignment of plant sdh family. espript output was obtained with the sequence alignment of plant sdhs and human sdh. secondary structures were inferred using human sdh  as a template, with springs representing helices and arrows representing beta-strands. sequences were grouped into  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> . amino acid site numbering above the alignment is according to lidh  without the first  <dig> amino acids. adjacent similarity amino acid sites were boxed in blue frame. similarity calculations were based on the complete sdh alignments but only partial sequences for sdh class i and sdh class ii were displayed. the active site residues identified in this study are marked with red triangles. conserved domains are indicated above the alignment.



gene duplication pattern characterization and synteny analysis
to characterise the expansion patterns of plant sdh gene family, nine species that were from different families and contained both classes of sdhs were selected for gene duplication and synteny analyses . as shown in table  <dig> , tandem duplication contributed the most to the expansion of the core eudicot sdh family, followed by wgd/segmental duplication. dispersed sdhs  and a single proximal sdh  were identified only in m. domestica and s. tuberosum. based on phylogenetic classification in the present study, class i and class ii sdh genes from e. grandis, p. trichocarpa, t. cacao and v. vinifera are located in a tandem manner in their corresponding chromosomes, which provides strong support that sdh class i and sdh class ii are tandem duplications. a similar pattern was observed with c. sinensis whereby cs9g <dig>   is separated by a single-gene insertion with the two class i sdh genes . this may be caused by gene insertion after tandem duplication. class i and class ii sdh genes in the three rosaceae species  and in s. tuberosum are separated either on the one chromosome or on separate chromosomes altogether, indicating a divergent evolutionary history for sdh genes in the rosaceae family and in s. tuberosum compared to other plants. sdh genes on chromosome  <dig>  and chromosome  <dig>  in m. domestica were highly duplicated by tandem duplication , in contrast to the other rosaceae species . notably, the class i sdh gene from s. tuberosum  and the class ii sdh gene from m. domestica  were identified as dispersed duplicates, which may underpin the divergent sorbitol metabolism profiles across these species.table  <dig>

sdh gene duplication patterns were characterized by the duplicate_gene_classifier program in the mcscanx package. “wgd or sgm” refers to whole genome duplication or segmental duplication. “sdh class” is defined according to the present phylogenetic analysis. notably, mdp <dig> from m. domestica could not be anchored in any chromosome and was therefore absent in this table.



to investigate the conservation of sdh genes across species, collinear sdh gene pairs were identified within and across species. sdh genes from the nine above-mentioned species were analysed. the single sdh gene  from the model plant a. thaliana was also used as a reference for collinear block identification. as shown in figure  <dig>  all target plant genomes contained at least one sdh gene  with collinear sdh genes in all other nine species studied, indicating a conserved collinear sdh block. sdh genes at gene positions f, g, i, k and o, concerning only the rosaceae species investigated, were collinear with sdh genes in only some of the species included in the present analysis. in particular, position f at chromosome  <dig>  of p. persica paired only with position i at chromosome  <dig>  of p. mume. while position f was found collinear only with position i, position i had another collinear region at position o from e. grandis. position g at chromosome  <dig>  of p. persica was only paired with positions a, e and k from a. thaliana, p. trichocarpa and m. domestica respectively. some collinear sdh gene pairs, such as f-i, g-k and k-o, were restricted to rosaceae species only, reflecting genetic features shared only by these plants. notably, intra-species collinear sdh pairs were identified only within m. domestica but not in p. mume, p. persica and s. tuberosum although all of these species have sdh genes located on multiple chromosomes . this observation could be explained by the fact that the apple genome underwent a recent  wgd, which doubled the chromosome number from nine to  <dig> in the pyreae  <cit>  while most other rosaceae plants have a haploid chromosome number of  <dig>   <dig> or  <dig>  s. tuberosum was unique among the species investigated in that it had a class ii sdh gene  but no class i sdh gene preserved in the collinear region . the class i sdh gene , which was identified as a dispersed duplication , was the only sdh gene for which no collinear gene was identified in the present analysis. since the class ii sdh homologue  in v. vinifera has been shown to be involved in ta synthesis  <cit> , it would be of great interest to investigate the potential role of sdhs in s. tuberosum, which has also been shown to accumulate a significant amount of ta  <cit> . noteworthy, s. lycopersicum, another species from the solanale order, accumulates no ta  <cit>  and contains only a single sdh, which belongs to class i .figure  <dig> identification of collinear gene pairs among plant sdh families. a circular plot of sdh gene family collinearity. collinear sdh genes are linked by red curved lines. sdh genes located at each position in corresponding chromosomes are indicated. family collinearity is shown in the genomic collinearity background. only those chromosomes containing sdh genes are included.



natural selection analysis
assessment of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution ratios is important to understand molecular evolution at the amino acid level  <cit> . to examine the intensity of natural selection acting on the specific clade, the ratio  of non-synonymous substitution to synonymous substitution in the developed plant sdh phylogeny was investigated, whereby w< <dig>  w= <dig> and w> <dig> indicated purifying selection, neutral evolution and positive selection respectively. based on our phylogeny results, four branches  were specified for w assessments . firstly, the branch-specific likelihood model  <cit>  was applied to the sdh data. as can be seen in table  <dig>  likelihood-ratio tests  showed that the two-ratio model and the four-ratio model fit the dataset significantly better  than the one-ratio model. in contrast, the three-ratio model assumption lacked statistical support . given that the two-ratio and four-ratio models assume unequal w ratios for the class i and class ii branches while the three-ratio model specifies w=w , the above calculation suggested that the w ratio for the core eudicot sdh class ii was significantly different from that of class i. moreover, the four-ratio model, which assumes unequal w ratios for the monocot, a.coerulea and class i branches , was not significantly better  than the two-ratio model . this indicated that the w ratios for monocot, a. coerulea and core eudicot class i branches had no significant difference. notably, all branch-specific models tested demonstrated a low w value for the monocot, a. coerulea and class i branches , suggesting that plant sdhs have been under strong purifying selection. this agrees well with the suggestion that functional proteins are usually under strong structural and functional constraints  <cit> . it should be noted that w were infinite in both multi-ratio models . this is because an extremely low level of synonymous substitution or no synonymous substitution was detected in the sdh class ii clade. on the other hand, the number of non-synonymous substitutions in the core sdh class ii clade was estimated to be  <dig>  and  <dig>  respectively for the two-ratio model and the four-ratio model. in contrast, only  <dig>  non-synonymous substitution was detected for the sdh class i clade with the two-ratio model  and no non-synonymous substitution was detected with the four-ratio model . these results provided clear evidence that positive selection had occurred in the lineage leading to core eudicot sdh class ii. to test whether w is significantly higher than  <dig>  the log likelihood value  was calculated for the two-ratio model with w= <dig> fixed. results showed that this model was not significantly worse than the two-ratio model without the “w=1” constraint , suggesting that w was not significantly greater than  <dig> at the 5% significance level. this leads to the hypothesis that positive selection in sdh class ii might have only affected particular amino acid residues in the protein sequence, which is possible for a functional protein under strong structural and functional constraints  <cit> . to test this, site-specific likelihood analysis was performed on the same data, which assumes variable selection pressures among amino acid sites but no variation among branches in the phylogeny. results  showed that the selection model  fitted the dataset significantly better  than the one-ratio model but was not better  than the neutral model . these results indicated a significant variation of selection pressure among amino acid sites of plant sdh. however, the selection model failed to detect any positively selected amino acid site at a significant level , which suggested that no positively selected amino acid site could be identified across all branches. therefore, we speculate that the positive selection might have only acted on a few amino acid sites in the core eudicot sdh class ii clade.table  <dig>

all calculations were implemented using codeml at paml <dig> . different models were specified according to the software instruction. “np” refers to the number of parameters, “l = ” refers to the log value of the likelihood. the estimated parameters w and p refer to the ka/ks ratio and the percentage of the corresponding site classes respectively. in the one-ratio model m <dig> and the branch-specific models, w, w, w and w stand for the w ratios for the monocot, a. coerulea, sdh class i and sdh class ii branches respectively. in the site-specific models and the branch-site models, w <dig>  w <dig> and w <dig> represent the w ratios for the specific site classes in respective models . for the branch-site models, the sdh class ii branch was specified as the foreground branch. amino acid site numbering is according to lidh  without the first  <dig> amino acids.



in this context, a branch-site model  <cit>  that permits variable w ratios among both amino acid sites and branches was applied. model a successfully identified the potential amino acid sites under positive selection in the sdh class ii branch . specifically, 42h, 43f, 112g, 113s, 116t and 270q  without the first  <dig> amino acids) were identified with model a . lrts test showed that model a fit the data significantly better  than the neutral model m <dig>  the comparison  of model a with its null hypothesis which assumes w2= <dig>  indicated that these amino acid sites had undergone positive selection in sdh class ii but not in the background branches. in addition, the model a test demonstrated that  <dig> %  of the amino acids of sdh were under strong purifying selection  and  <dig> % were under neutral selection  in all branches. no positive selection could be detected in the background branches . taken together, these calculations demonstrated that plant sdhs were under strong purifying selection pressure and were highly conserved across all the plant species, and more importantly, that positive natural selection had occurred in the sdh class ii clade, affecting specific amino acids, namely 42h, 43f, 112g, 113s, 116t and 270q.

ancestral sequence reconstruction and evolution rate analysis
to characterize the evolutionary rates for different groups of plant sdhs, ancestral amino acid sequences for the developed sdh phylogeny were reconstructed. results  showed that  <dig> potential amino acid substitutions  without the first  <dig> amino acids) occurred in the branch leading to sdh class ii from the common ancestor of core eudicot sdh. this finding corresponded well with the natural selection analysis, whereby six out of the nine amino acid sites were identified to be under positive selection . in contrast, no substitution was detected in the branch leading to core eudicot sdh class i . relative rate tests   <cit>  using monocot sdh as the out-group showed that core eudicot sdh class ii evolved significantly faster than core eudicot sdh class i , indicating a relaxed selection pressure on sdh class ii. in contrast, a. coerulea sdh and core eudicot class i sdh demonstrated no significant difference .

to deduce the reaction mechanism and identify the potential active sites of plant sdhs, protein structure models of v. vinifera class i sdh  and class ii sdh  were created based on human sdh . ligands including zinc, nad+, d-sorbitol and l-idonate were docked into the models . our models contain one zinc binding site, located in the active site. some published sdh crystal structures  contain a second, structural zinc-binding site distant from the active site catalytic zinc atom; this is not however a universal feature of these enzymes. no function has been correlated with the second, structural zinc-binding site. the sequence of our homology models does not support a second, structural zinc-binding site, as the necessary side chains required for zinc coordination are absent. a ribbons diagram of the overall structure of the homology models can be seen in figure 5a, with vv_sdh and vv_lidh adopting a typical dehydrogenase fold with an nad+ binding site conforming to a rossmann fold. the catalytic zinc ion in the active site was modelled coordinating to 36c, 61h and 62e  without the first  <dig> amino acids). all three of these residues together with 147e  are strictly conserved in plant sdhs . the 2′ and 3′ hydroxyls of the nad+ ribose in our model were poised to 195d , potentially forming hydrogen bonds . the preservation of 195d instead of 195a at this amino acid site has been shown to be the structural basis for the selection of nad  over nadp  as coenzyme  <cit> . this amino acid site is strictly conserved in all plant sdhs , implying that plant sdhs preferably utilize nad . this suggestion is consistent with the lack of nadp-sdh activity for plant sdhs  <cit> . previous characterizations of sdhs from arabidopsis  <cit> , tomato  <cit> , apple  <cit>  and pear  <cit>  have suggested that plant sdhs exhibit highest activity for the oxidation of sorbitol, while also being able to oxidize other polyols such as xylitol and ribitol at lower reaction rates. however, the characterization of v. vinifera lidh showed that this enzyme demonstrated the highest reaction rate on l-idonate but had a low reaction rate with sorbitol  <cit> . upon docking of l-idonate, we found overall similar hydrogen bonding patterns with sorbitol as those proposed by pauly et al.  <cit>  and yennawar et al.  <cit> . earlier studies on enzyme substrate specificity also indicated that sdhs preferentially use substrates with a d-cis- <dig> -dihydroxyl  configuration  <cit>  . l-idonate and d-sorbitol have the same molecular configuration from c <dig> to c <dig> and differ only at c <dig>  and c <dig>  . protein modelling analyses showed that l-idonate occupied a comparable position in the active site to sorbitol . therefore a similar reaction mechanism for l-idonate oxidation by v. vinifera lidh is possible with d-sorbitol oxidation by human sdh  <cit> . the hydroxyl groups at c <dig> and c <dig> of l-idonate were modelled within interacting distance of the zinc atom in v. vinifera lidh , which may facilitate the proton transfer from c <dig> hydroxyl to nad+, ultimately resulting in an oxidized c <dig> with ketone and the production of nadh . previous work suggested that the preferential binding of l-idonate over sorbitol seen in v.vinifera lidh may be attributed to amino acid substitution at the catalytic sites between paralogous proteins  <cit> . as a result, the catalytic site of plant sdhs was investigated based on our models of v.vinifera sdh homologs.figure  <dig> homology models of vv_lidh and vv_sdh and proposed reaction mechanisms. a. structure superimposition of vv_lidh_idonate  and vv_sdh_sorbitol  in ribbon forms. b. the proposed reaction mechanism for vv_lidh on the oxidation of l-idonate into 5-keto-d-gluconate . c. superimposition of the active site residues of vv_lidh  and vv_sdh . the distances  between corresponding atoms are labelled. target active site residues are shown in stick forms and labelled correspondingly. d. hydrophobicity variance at y42h between vv_lidh  and vv_sdh  with red and white colours representing the highest hydrophobicity and the lowest hydrophobicity respectively.  without the first  <dig> amino acids).



nineteen putative active site residues  without the first  <dig> amino acids) were identified either coordinating the zinc ion or forming potential non-covalent interactions with nad and l-idonate. ten out of the  <dig> residues were considered strictly conserved throughout all plant sdh forms, and six additional residues are also largely conserved with variations in only a few sdh sequences . these observations revealed a potential structural basis for the preserved function of plant sdhs. interestingly, three other residues were found to be uniformly exchanged  between core eudicot sdh class i and class ii while monocot and a. coerulea sdhs resemble sdh class i at these amino acid sites . a closer inspection of these residues showed that the oxygen atom of c <dig> hydroxyl of l-idonate was poised to potentially interact with both 42h and 113s within distances of 4 Å and  <dig>  Å respectively . additionally, the oxygen atom of the c <dig> ketone group of l-idonate was within non-covalent interaction distance to 113s . notably, the replacement of 42y  with 42h  in lidh has the potential to change the hydrophobicity in the substrate-binding pocket , which may lead to the preferential binding of l-idonate over d-sorbitol. these observations potentially provided a structural explanation for the unique activity of v. vinifera lidh compared to other plant sdhs. previous studies have indicated that the chiral configuration at c <dig> is not a determining factor for sdh substrate specificity  <cit> , however, our analysis suggested that the c <dig> hydroxyl group and the c <dig> ketone group of l-idonate potentially affect substrate binding affinity due to amino acid substitutions at 42h, 112g and 113s in class ii sdhs. a previously identified sdh from apple fruit  <cit>  was found to be the single class ii sdh  in m. domestica in the present study. this sdh has a much lower affinity for sorbitol  compared to other sdhs purified  or cloned  from apple species. while the kinetic differences were suggested to be due to protein configuration changes between the fusion protein and native protein  <cit> , the present analysis indicated that they might have been be due also to amino acid substitutions at the catalytic site.

from an evolutionary point of view, amino acid changes leading to the shift of enzyme substrate specificity are usually derived from positive darwinian selection after gene duplication  <cit> . results from the natural selection analyses in the present study are consistent with this suggestion. the three amino acid sites  displaying substitutions between sdh class i and class ii are all under positive natural selection . at the moment, the enzymatic characterization of plant sdh is still fragmentary; no information is available regarding plant sdh activity with l-idonate, except for the activity of v. vinifera lidh  <cit> . site mutation and enzymatic studies are currently underway in our laboratory to investigate this hypothesis.

meta-analysis of sorbitol dehydrogenase related gene expression
in addition to changes in enzyme activity, gene evolution after duplication can also occur at the transcriptional level  <cit> . expression division appears to be more common than structural evolution and often occurs rapidly after gene duplication  <cit> . to further characterize the evolutionary pattern of plant sdh genes and also to explore the role of sdh related genes during plant development, a survey of transcriptional data was undertaken. based on the availability of microarray and rna sequencing data and the presence of both classes of sdh in the genome, grapevine and citrus species were selected. in addition, the expression profile of the single class i sdh  in a. thaliana was used as a model reference  <cit> . this gene was highly expressed in cotyledons, leaves and late stages of seed development compared to organs such as flowers  and shoots , where it was marginally expressed .the results support a potential role for sdh class i during seed germination in a. thaliana  <cit> , soybean  <cit>  and maize  <cit> . in grapevines, transcriptional patterns of vit_16s0100g <dig>  and vit_16s0100g <dig>  were analysed using the normalised grapevine gene expression atlas of the ‘corvina’ cultivar  <cit> . notable differences in gene expression intensities and dynamics were observed between sdh class i and class ii . the transcript abundance of grapevine sdh class i was highest in the ripening stages of berries , resembling the expression profiles reported for class i sdhs in apple  <cit> . in most cases, transcript abundance was lowest in young berry growth stages and increased gradually until harvest in berry tissues. developmental up-regulation of sdh class i transcripts in other cultivars such as ‘shiraz’  <cit>  and ‘tempranillo’  <cit>  during berry development under normal conditions was also evident. in addition, the latter work showed sorbitol is present in leaves and berries, and that the biochemical activity of sdh class i, involving sorbitol oxidation, coincided with sdh class i transcripts levels in these berries during development  <cit> . similarly, developmental increases of the grapevine sdh class i transcript were observed in leaf, rachis, seed and tendrils. interestingly, gene expression of grapevine sdh class i was highly induced in winter buds and followed a gradual down-regulation during dormancy release. a similar gene expression and protein activity pattern reported in raspberry  <cit>  and pear  <cit>  respectively may reflect a response to the environment where dormancy periods encompasses dehydration and temperature  stress, although developmental processes could take place concurrently. taken together, this suggests an active role for sdh class i in developmental processes through the coordinated regulation of transcript and protein activities in controlling the flux of sorbitol  in grapevines which may be critical in maintaining cell and tissue homeostasis in the mature tissues  <cit>  where oxidative stress is inherent  <cit> .figure  <dig> transcript and gene co-expression profiles of sdh in different plants. a. expression profiles for class i and class ii sdh genes in various tissues and developmental stages of v. vinifera. class i and ii sdh genes were moderately to highly expressed in most tissues . the heatmap was adjusted to colour ranges between log <dig> intensity of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  to illustrate low, moderate and high expression when compared to all other genes respectively. b. expression profiles for class i and class ii sdh gene in citrus. the heatmap was adjusted to colour ranges between log <dig> intensity of  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  to illustrate low, moderate and high expression when compared to all other genes respectively. c. heatmap of selected enriched go terms  for genes co-expressed with sdhs from a. thaliana , v. vinifera , c. sinensis , p .trichocarpa  <cit> , o. sativa  and associated frequencies in the plants tested. light and dark orange denote enrichment scores between  <dig> and  <dig> respectively. highly enriched scores  are coloured in red. grey colour denotes no significant enrichment.



expression profiles of sdh class ii were well represented in most grapevine organs with the highest expression in berries at fruit-set and in flower carpels. a striking developmental down-regulation of grapevine sdh class ii genes was evident in most grapevine organs, where expression levels in young tissues of berries , buds, leaves, stems and tendrils were high and gradually decreased during development . we have previously demonstrated in a cross-comparison study involving rna-seq, microarray and qrt-pcr in young, early veraison, late veraison and ripening berries of grapevine  <cit>  that sdh class ii genes were developmentally down-regulated consistently in all profiling platforms. this distinct expression coincides with the accumulation of ta biosynthesis in young/immature tissues  <cit> .

in citrus, sdh class i and sdh class ii genes were represented by probesets “cit. <dig> .s1_s_at” and “cit. <dig> .s1_s_at” respectively. although gene expression studies encompassing developmental series in citrus are not as comprehensive compared to a. thaliana and grapevine, several striking observations could be inferred . the citrus sdh class i gene was highly expressed regardless of organ and tissue, including stems, roots, leaves, ovules and fruit tissues , similar to that of grapevine sdh class i. interestingly, sdh class ii genes were expressed to a very low level  in the majority of organs, including fruit tissues, except for the root where expression was highest. it is speculated that this may reflect the trace amount of ta detected in fruits of sweet oranges and other citrus species  <cit> . until now, no information, to our knowledge, has been reported on the function of citrus sdhs. given the novel transcription profiles of one the two citrus class ii sdhs , and the presence of an additional class ii sdh , these features may indicate a novel function of sdhs specific to root tissues of sweet oranges and therefore, deserve more attention in future research. in addition to v. vinifera and citrus, divergent transcription profiles have also been reported for sdhs from apple  <cit>  and pear  <cit>  where the single copy class ii sdh genes were shown to be under independent transcriptional regulation from other sdh genes. taken together, divergent expression profiles for sdh class i and sdh class ii appear to be true to all species where two classes are present, supporting a gene functional divergence at the expression level.

gene co-expression mining in various plant species
gene co-expression network analysis  is based on the principle that genes involved in similar and/or related biological processes may be expressed in a proportional manner, thereby providing a unique tool to understand gene function. based on information availability, co-expressed gene lists of sdhs from a. thaliana, rice, poplar, grapevine and citrus  were retrieved from publicly available co-expression databases  <cit> . in a. thaliana, the sdh class i homologue  was significantly co-expressed with  <dig> genes  involved in branched chain amino acid metabolism,  <dig> genes  involved in response to various stimuli,  <dig> genes  involved in protein import in the peroxisome and  <dig> genes  involved in auxin metabolism . in grapevines, the sdh class i homologue  was significantly co-expressed with genes involved in abiotic stress , peptide metabolism  and lipid metabolism  . the co-expression results presented here corroborated with recent findings that the importance of sdh class i lies in regulating sorbitol levels via its biochemical activity and gene expression during various abiotic stresses  <cit> . more importantly, intracellular accumulation of sorbitol to high levels, accentuated under salt and osmotic stress, significantly reduced stress-induced biomass loss of grapevine berry cell suspensions which were likely the results of the polyol utilisation as an effective osmoprotectant and cellular homeostasis buffer  <cit> . similar to its arabidopsis counterpart , it is therefore likely that grapevine sdh class i plays an important role in abiotic stress tolerance via the synergistic regulation of polyol transport and metabolism. the sdh class ii homologue  was also significantly co-expressed with genes related to abiotic stress response . other genes related to hexose biosynthetic pathways and carbohydrate metabolism , protein biogenesis and catabolism  and malic acid transport  were also evident in the list of co-expressed genes . go terms associated with these genes were also enriched within the gene lists . interestingly, go enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes showed that terms associated with “malate trans-membrane transport” and “response to abiotic stimulus” were highly enriched  . similarly to the grapevine sdh class i gene, sdh class ii transcription was also stress responsive, being down-regulated during the heat stress recovery of grapevine leaves and up-regulated during exposure to uv-c light irradiation . based on our coexpression analysis, we speculate that the involvement of class ii sdhs in abiotic stress responses is likely to occur via a separate mechanism from that of sorbitol metabolism, namely the ascorbate-glutathione cycle  <cit>  and specifically in regulating the balance between the biosynthesis of ascorbate by the l-galactose pathway  <cit>  and its catabolism. this is supported in part in grapevines in which a marked down-regulation of sdh class ii  protein  and the up-regulation of proteins involved in l-galactose pathway  in shoots of grapevines during drought stress were observed  <cit> . therefore, the stress responsive nature of sdh class ii gene and enzyme could potentially function as an extra level of control . the c. sinensis sdh class ii gene  was significantly co-expressed with genes involved in ion transport , ubiquinone biosynthesis/oxidative phosphorylation  and ribosome biogenesis  . go terms associated with these genes were highly enriched within the co-expressed gene lists . unlike class i sdhs, enriched go terms associated with class ii sdh co-expressed genes were more specialised to each corresponding plant but shared a common set of co-expressed genes related to transporters . in rice, the top  <dig> genes co-expressed with sdh  were primarily enriched for genes involved in stress response , carboxylic acid biosynthesis , plastid organisation , protein transport  and starch metabolism  .

enriched go parent terms such as “response to stimulus” and descendent terms “response to abiotic stimulus”, were frequently enriched in sdh class i co-expressed lists and slightly in sdh class ii containing plant species . these observations agreed with previous reports that sdhs  in a. thaliana  <cit>  and grapevine  <cit>  play an active role during drought stress and recovery processes and also suggest some shared functions related to stress tolerance between the two classes of sdh, even though to a conservative degree and potentially involving a separate mechanistic route. therefore, enriched go parent terms associated with “organic acid metabolic process” and “branched-chain amino acid metabolism” were demonstrated to be more relevant to sdh class i co-expressed genes but not to sdh class ii . this is not surprising as response to various stresses involves the coordinated regulation of amino acid and polyol accumulation  <cit> . on the other hand, co-expression analysis showed that plant sdh class ii could be tightly linked to mechanisms related to transport and compartmentation of cations and solutes . in membrane transport and compartmentation systems involving pumps, carriers and ion channels are also pivotal for ion homeostasis and equivocally involved in a wide range of stress conditions  <cit> . in addition, divergent co-expression profiles across species have also been observed for both classes of sdh. in general, monocot rice sdh-related genes have more common co-expression responses with core eudicot sdh class i than with sdh class ii, corresponding with the finding that monocot sdh has a closer relationship with core eudicot sdh class i than sdh class ii at the enzyme structural level.

CONCLUSIONS
sdh is the key enzyme involved in sorbitol metabolism in higher plants. the results of the present study demonstrated that core eudicot sdhs have evolved into two distinct lineages: sdh class i and sdh class ii. class i sdh genes were present in all core eudicot species investigated in this study and appear to be essential for the normal growth of plants. class ii sdh genes were found to be absent in brassicaceae, leguminosae, most asterids  and some other plants. the previously characterized lidh involved in ta synthesis in v. vinifera has now been identified as a class ii sdh and represents a novel function of sdh genes in v. vinifera. the role of lidh in ta synthesis may be relevant to the function of class ii sdhs in other species. phylogeny, natural selection and genomic structure analyses supported the emergence of sdh class ii as a result of positive natural selection after tandem duplication, which might occur in the common ancestor of core eudicot plants. furthermore, positive natural selection has only acted on specific amino acid sites in the sdh class ii lineage. protein modelling analyses revealed substitutions of three putative active site residues for class i and class ii sdhs, which may be responsible for the unique enzyme activity of v. vinifera lidh. gene expression analysis demonstrated a clear transcriptional divergence between sdh class i and class ii in several plants and supports the divergence of class ii sdhs at the expression level as well. future work should be dedicated to uncovering the enzymatic activities and roles of class ii sdh gene products in plant metabolism.
