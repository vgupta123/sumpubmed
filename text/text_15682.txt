BACKGROUND
specialized glandular trichomes can produce and accumulate large quantities of terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids and alkaloids, which they can also secrete  <cit> . rna sequencing in combination with metabolite profile analysis of glandular trichomes and proteomics have shed light on the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in the trichomes of various plant species  <cit> . through the production of est libraries, micro-arrays and high-throughput sequencing of  trichome rna, genes have been identified that are involved in the terpenoid, phenylpropanoid, alkaloid and flavonoid biosynthesis in various plant species, including tomato , sweet basil  <cit> , tobacco  <cit> , mint  <cit> , alfalfa  <cit> , artemisia annua <cit>  and hop  <cit> . although est sequencing has been instrumental in the discovery of enzymes of trichome-specialized metabolism  <cit> , next generation sequencing  can give a more in-depth picture of transcriptomes. ngs technologies  has been used for characterization of several trichome transcriptomes, for example from plants of medical importance like artemisia annua  or huperzia serrata and phlegmariurus carinatus . ngs has also been used for gene discovery, for example in combination with shotgun proteomics and metabolite analysis of tomato  trichomes, leading to the discovery of the leaf-trichome-specific β-caryophyllene/α-humulene synthase . ngs of trichomes rna from wild and cultivated tomato varieties led to the discovery and characterization of various sesquiterpene synthases, providing insight into the evolution of terpene synthases  <cit> .

terpene biosynthesis in tomato plants is of major interest because terpenes play an important role in the plant’s defense . the sequencing of the cultivated tomato genome has enabled the characterization of its terpene synthase  gene family  <cit> , but not much is known about the regulation of the terpenoid pathway. transcriptional control of biosynthetic genes is a major mechanism by which secondary metabolite production is regulated  <cit> .

there are not many transcription factors  known to be involved in regulation of terpenoid pathways. orca <dig>  a jasmonate-responsive apetala <dig> -domain transcription factor from catharanthus roseus, has been shown to regulate expression of strictosidine synthase  involved in terpene indole alkaloid biosynthesis  <cit> . subsequently, a methyl-jasmonate -inducible transcription factor of the myc family  was shown to positively regulate orca <dig> <cit> . crwrky <dig> was identified as being involved in the root-specific accumulation of serpentine in c. roseus plants and as being induced by phytohormones including ja  <cit> . this tf appeared to negatively regulate orca <dig> and to a lesser extend crmyc <dig> <cit> . a meja-inducible wrky transcription factor from gossypium arboreum that regulates the sesquiterpene synthase -δ-cadiene synthase a in cotton fibers was identified by xu et al. <cit> . ma et al.  <cit>  demonstrated that a meja-inducible wrky transcription factor from artemisia annua is involved in the regulation of artemisinin biosynthesis. more recently two ja-responsive ap <dig> family transcription factors from a. annua  were found to regulate amorpha- <dig> -diene synthase , a sesquiterpene synthase involved in the biosynthesis of artemisinin  <cit>  whereas lu et al.  <cit>  identified aaora, a ap2/erf tf, that regulates several genes in the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway including aaerf <dig>  most recently, the meja-inducible arabidopsis thaliana myc <dig> transcription factor  <cit>  was shown to regulate sesquiterpene synthases attps <dig> and attps <dig> <cit> .

here, we used ngs of tomato stem trichomes as a tool for gene discovery. first, a transcript database was created from normalized cdna, which was mined for transcription factors. then, in order to narrow down the number of tfs potentially involved in terpene biosynthesis, an expression profiling database was created using illumina sequencing of trichome rnas from plants treated with or without jasmonic acid , since ja is known to induce terpene emission in tomato and to regulate several terpene synthases  <cit> . to identify tfs that regulate terpene biosynthesis we used a transient assay based on the transactivation of tomato terpene synthase promoters in planta.

RESULTS
assembly of rnaseq data and genome analyzer ii transcript profiling
we created a tomato trichome est database by sequencing a mixture of glandular and non-glandular trichome rnas, derived from stems of solanum lycopersicum cv. moneymaker plants. the resulting cdna was normalized prior to being used as input for  <dig> gs flx titanium pyrosequencing. a full plate was sequenced consisting of two halves: one with cdnas originating from control plants and the other half with cdnas originating from plants treated with ja. in total we obtained  <dig>  high-quality reads with an average length of 337 bp. the reads from control and ja-treated samples were assembled de novo resulting in  <dig>  contigs with an average length of 931 bp, leaving  <dig>  reads unmatched , with an average length of 241 bp. nucleotide sequences of the contigs were blasted against the solanaceae genomics network  tomato database for annotation, using a local e-blast tool;  <dig>  contigs were not annotated.

for creating the transcript profiling databases with genome analyzer ii, the same rna material as for the  <dig> sequencing was used, but this time the cdna derived from control and ja-treated stem trichomes was not normalized before being processed. we specifically obtained  <dig> , <dig> 3’ sequences from the control sample and  <dig> , <dig> from the ja-treated sample.  <dig> , <dig> and  <dig> , <dig> reads from the control and ja-samples, respectively, were mapped to one unique contig of the trichome database. in addition,  <dig>   and  <dig>   reads were mapped to multiple contigs and  <dig>   and  <dig>   remained unmapped.

both the  <dig> gs flx titanium reads and the genome analyzer ii reads can be found in the sequence read archive of ncbi  under accession number srp <dig> 

annotation, gene ontology and protein families
in order to characterize the s. lycopersicum stem trichome transcriptome the unique contigs  were submitted to homology searches  in the national center for biotechnology information  non-redundant protein database using blast2go  <cit> .  <dig>  contigs did not return a blastx hit. the majority of the top hits were to protein sequences of vitis vinifera, followed by populus trichocarpa, ricinus communis and solanum lycopersicum.

next, gene ontology  and enzyme classifications  were performed in order to classify the ests. it must be noted that one sequence could be assigned to more than one go term. for the cellular component class the assignments were mostly given to cell and organelle . the highest percentage of molecular function go terms were in binding and catalytic activity . in the biological processes, the majority of the go terms was grouped into two categories- those of metabolic and cellular process . finally, within the predicted ecs, the prevailing categories of enzymes were transferases and oxidoreductases .

the search of additional databases for protein families, domains, regions and sites was performed from blast2go via the interpro ebi web server. the  <dig> top interpro entries obtained are presented in table  <dig>  the most dominant class of enzymes was protein kinases. abundantly represented were also cytochrome p450s.table  <dig>

selection of transcription factors potentially involved in regulating terpene synthases
based on the annotated contigs  <dig> transcription factors of different classes were found in the trichome database:  <dig> wrky,  <dig> myb,  <dig> myc,  <dig> bzip,  <dig> arf,  <dig> erf,  <dig> znf,  <dig> bhlh,  <dig> mads,  <dig> nac and  <dig> of unknown function/class. out of those,  <dig> were up-regulated  by the treatment with ja,  <dig> were down-regulated  and expression of  <dig> tfs remained unaltered. since ja is known to play a role in the plant’s direct and indirect defenses we were interested in those transcription factors that were induced by ja and could therefore potentially be involved in up-regulating terpene biosynthesis.  <dig> of the tfs that were up-regulated by ja showed an induction higher than 2-fold. the sequence of these  <dig> tfs was blasted against the tomato genomic sequence  and complete orfs were constructed when possible , if not provided by the rnaseq. these sequences were submitted to homology search after translation against the ncbi database for identifying conserved domains. from this analysis  <dig> tfs  were selected for further investigation as follows: we focused on classes of tfs involved in the regulation of terpenoids identified so far in other plant species- namely tfs of the apetala <dig> class  <cit> , wrky class  and myc class  <cit> . in total eleven transcription factors of the ap <dig> class, four of the wrky class and one of the myc class, although it only showed a  <dig> -fold induction, were selected for further investigation of their potential involvement in regulating expression of terpene synthases.table  <dig>

tissue specificity and ja responsiveness of selected transcription factors
the sixteen candidate tfs should ideally be trichome-specifically expressed and possibly induced by jasmonic acid. in order to investigate the expression pattern of these genes, cdna was synthesized from different s. lycopersicum cv. moneymaker organs and tissues: leaves, stems, isolated stem trichomes and roots from 4-week-old plants, as well as flowers and fruit of mature plants. in figure  <dig> transcript levels, as determined by q-rt-pcr, are presented for four of the sixteen selected transcription factors. for the other twelve candidate tfs expression in the trichomes was much lower than that in the other organs/tissues and these were excluded from further analysis. tf slmyc <dig>  was predominately expressed in trichomes, but also in leaves and flowers . slwrky <dig> was expressed in leaves, trichomes, roots and flowers . slwrky <dig> was a trichome-specific gene  and slwrky <dig> was expressed in trichomes, roots and fruit . q-rt-pcr analyses indicated that none of the selected transcription factors was significantly induced by ja according . slwrky <dig> expression appeared to be approximately  <dig> -fold reduced in ja treated plants .figure  <dig>

slmyc <dig> and slwrky <dig> can transactivate terpene synthase promoters in nicotiana benthamiana leaves
in order to investigate whether these tfs could activate a selection of terpene synthase promoters, a transient assay in nicotiana benthamiana leaves was used, which has been previously shown to work for the interaction between the zinc finger-like transcription factor expression of terpenoids  <dig>  and the sltps <dig> promoter  <cit> . in the reporter construct, expression of β-glucuronidase  is driven by the glandular trichome-specific promoter of sltps <dig>  co-infiltration with the 35s:sleot <dig> effector construct resulted in transactivation of the sltps <dig> promoter, leading to gus expression in this heterologous system . as negative control for the effector, a 35s:rfp construct was used. various other reporter constructs with promoters of other terpene synthases- sltps <dig>  sltps <dig> and sltps8- driving expression of gus or a gussyfp <dig> fusion  were included in the analyses.figure  <dig>

as shown in figure 3a, slwrky <dig> could transactivate the sltps <dig> promoter, albeit to a lower extent than sleot <dig>  slwrky <dig> transactivated the sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> promoters only weakly, and the sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> promoters not at all . slwrky <dig> or slwrky <dig> did not transactivate any of the terpene synthase promoters .

slmyc <dig> could transactivate all terpene synthase promoters tested except sltps <dig>  transactivation of the trichome-specific sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> promoters was strongest . however, it should be noted that gus activity of a promoter driving the gussyfp <dig> fusion was lower than when the same promoter driving gus alone was transactivated by an effector construct , possibly because the fusion protein was less stable or produced. therefore, transactivation by slmyc <dig> of the trichome-specific sltps <dig> promoter was potentially stronger than that detected here.

slmyc <dig> and sleot <dig> act synergistically on the sltps <dig> promoter in n. benthamiana leaves
since sleot <dig>  slmyc <dig> and slwrky <dig> were shown in separate experiments to be able to transactivate the sltps <dig> promoter , we investigated what effect a combination of these transcription factors would have on the transactivation of this promoter. to this end, agrobacterium cultures carrying the camv 35s-driven effector constructs were mixed in pairs or all three together and combined with the sltps5p: gus reporter construct and infiltrated in n. benthamiana leaves . interestingly, co-expression of sleot <dig> and slmyc <dig> almost tripled the transactivation of sltps <dig> promoter compared to the effect of each tf alone. adding slwrky <dig> did not have an additional effect, but rather seemed to have a negative effect on the combinatorial action of the other two tfs, although not at a statistically significant level .figure  <dig>

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
rna sequencing of s. lycopersicum stem trichomes led to the identification of one myc bhlh and one wrky transcription factor that can transactivate several terpene synthase promoters. the observation that slmyc <dig> acts synergistically with sleot <dig> in the transactivation of the sltps <dig> promoter suggests a complex regulatory network for terpene biosynthesis.

high-throughput sequencing of solanum lycopersicum stem trichomes
we used massive parallel pyrosequencing on the  <dig> gs flx titanium platform to sequence s. lycopersicum stem trichome rnas with the goal to identify transcription factors involved in terpene biosynthesis. we used normalized cdna to maximize representation of low abundant transcripts and reduce representation of highly abundant transcripts. attempts to map the obtained reads to the publicly available mixed tissue sgn database led to a high percentage of unmapped reads and assignment of the same reads to multiple unigenes and therefore the reads were assembled de novo.  <dig> % of the reads could not be matched and were not used in further analysis.  <dig> % of the resulting contigs were subsequently annotated after blasting against the sgn tomato database using a local e-blast tool. in this database we identified annotated enzymes involved in several metabolic pathways . in short, compared to the study published by mcdowell and colleagues  <cit>  on s. lycopersicum cv. m <dig> trichomes, we identified in moneymaker trichomes cdnas encoding enzymes involved in for example the tca cycle, starch and sucrose metabolism , as well as secondary metabolite biosynthesis . photosynthesis related genes were also identified but were not as prevalent  as in m <dig> trichomes. such differences could originate from the fact that in our study we used a mix of moneymaker trichome types, including stalks, whereas mcdowell and colleagues focused on comparing different types of trichomes between solanum species and so clipped off and analyzed only the secretory cells of glandular trichomes  <cit> .

furthermore we created an expression profiling database using illumina sequencing in order to obtain genes regulated by ja. the success of the ja treatment is evident by the high induction of known ja markers, some of which are presented in table  <dig> .

jasmonic acid regulation of the terpene biosynthesis pathway in tomato trichomes
in order to investigate whether in stem trichomes of tomato moneymaker plants, regulation of terpene biosynthesis by ja is also on the precursor level besides on the level of individual tpss  <cit> , the quantitative database was mined for enzymes of the precursor pathways. the copy number of these genes varies between different plant species  <cit>  and, as shown in table  <dig>  different family members can vary in their expression levels and/or ja-inducibility. for example 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase , in contrast with arabidopsis, which contains a single functional gene, has diversified into two isogenes in other plant species including tomato  <cit> . whereas sldxs <dig> is ubiquitously expressed, sldxs <dig> is expressed only in a few tissues and in leaf trichomes its transcript abundance is much higher than that of sldxs <dig> <cit> , although this is not the case in stem trichomes . furthermore, sldxs <dig> is moderately induced by wounding in the cultivar moneymaker  <cit> , which correlates with the observed moderate induction of sldxs <dig> by ja . sldxs <dig> expression is also approximately threefold upregulated in the tomato cultivar castlemart upon feeding by manduca sexta larvae  <cit> .

the regulation of precursor genes of the mep pathway by wounding, hormones or elicitors has been demonstrated in various plant species . similarly, evidence for the regulation of precursor biosynthesis of the mevalonate  pathway is also abundant . for example, hmgr enzyme activity and protein level were shown to increase by fungal infection in potato tubers and sweet potato root  <cit> . furthermore, hmgr <dig> expression was induced by treatment with meja in potato, whereas hmgr <dig> expression was reduced  <cit> . in response to caterpillar herbivory, transcripts of hmgr <dig> were reduced in alfalfa  <cit> . our results show that in tomato stem trichomes hmgr <dig> and hmgr <dig> were induced by ja treatment approximately 2-fold, whereas expression of hmgr <dig> remained unaltered . none of the prenyl diphosphate synthases were induced in tomato trichomes by ja treatment, whereas two seemed to be downregulated . we did not find any transcripts for ggps <dig>  in our stem trichome database, although it has been shown to be induced in tomato leaves by ja-treatment  <cit> . finally, from the very recently identified cis-prenyltransferases only cpt <dig>  that produces medium-length chain polyisoprenoids  <cit> , was upregulated by ja,  <dig> -fold .

identification of transcription factors involved in regulating terpene synthases in tomato trichomes
our primary aim was to identify transcription factor that regulate terpene biosynthesis. based on the annotated contigs,  <dig> % of the transcripts in the tomato stem trichomes encode transcription factors. for comparison, in arabidopsis thaliana ~6% of the genes in all tissues encode tfs . since ja is essential for establishing indirect defense responses in tomato  <cit>  and the induction of terpene synthases in trichomes  <cit> , we hypothesized that tfs involved in the regulation of terpene biosynthesis would also be ja-inducible genes. most of the transcription factors known to be involved in regulation of terpenoid pathways are jasmonate-inducible and of the apetala <dig>  wrky or myc class . however, in arabidopsis it was recently shown that two myc transcription factors , which act additively with atmyc <dig> in the activation of ja responses, are, in contrast to atmyc <dig>  only marginally induced by ja treatment  <cit> . based on all the above, the initial selection of transcription factors to be analyzed from our quantitative stem trichome database was limited to tfs of the ap <dig>  wrky and myc class that showed a 2-fold or higher induction by ja treatment . none of the myc transcription factors of our database showed induction higher than  <dig>  so for further analysis the closest homolog of atmyc <dig>  <cit>  was selected, as it has been shown to activate the attps <dig> and attps <dig> promoters  <cit> . after discarding tfs that were not trichome-specific or did not show highest expression in trichomes, the list was narrowed down to four candidate transcription factors. according to the q-rt-pcr data however, none of these tfs was significantly induced by ja treatment . since the numbers of sequence reads of these genes is very low both in the control and ja samples , the fold-induction in the illumina experiments must have been overestimated.

slmyc <dig> and slwrky <dig> transactivate terpene synthase promoters in planta
a specific indication of whether any of these tfs are involved in regulating terpene biosynthesis would be the activation of terpene synthase promoters by the transcription factor. in transient activation assays in n. benthamiana leaves two of the four selected transcription factors were able to transactivate at least one terpene synthase promoter. slwrky <dig> showed strongest transactivation of the sltps <dig> promoter and in lesser extent of the sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> promoters . although slwrky <dig> is expressed highly in roots , slwrky <dig> could not transactivate the promoter of sltps <dig> that is mainly expressed in roots. it could also not transactivate the trichome-specific sesquiterpene synthase sltps <dig> promoter so it is possible that slwrky <dig> can transactivate only monoterpene synthases or at least not the sesquiterpene synthase tested here . as shown in figure 5slwrky <dig> and the respective tpss that it can transactivate are co-expressed in various tissues where the regulation could take place in the plant.figure  <dig> 
expression patterns and activation overview of tfs and tpss. putative positive interaction of the respective sltps promoters by transcription factors  slmyc <dig>   slwrky <dig> and  sleot <dig> is indicated by a colored box that represents the tissue in which they are co-expressed. expression in the various tissues is indicated by +++, ++, +, +/− and -- according to q-rt-pcr values. darker shaded boxes indicate a stronger transient activation of the tps promoter by the tf in n. benthamiana leaves. eot1; expression of terpenoids  <dig>  <cit> .



slmyc <dig> showed strongest transactivation of sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> and to a lesser extent of sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> but no transactivation of sltps <dig> promoter , although slmyc <dig> is also expressed in the root, albeit not strongly . as shown in figure 5slmyc <dig> is expressed  in every plant tissue and slmyc <dig> is able to activate all the terpene synthase promoters tested except one, so it seems to be a regulator of multiple tpss, in contrast to sleot <dig> that is only expressed in the glandular trichomes and can specifically transactivate the sltps <dig> promoter and none of the other tps promoters tested . the other two selected tfs  were not able to significantly transactivate any of the tested terpene synthase promoters. however it cannot be excluded that these tfs were not expressed in the transient assay.

one question that arises is, of course, where slwrky <dig> and slmyc <dig> bind on these terpene synthase promoters. in the promoter sequence of sltps <dig>  sltps <dig> and sltps <dig> <cit>  there are five, four and one w-boxes ) respectively , which could serve as potential binding site for slwrky <dig>  furthermore, sltps <dig> promoter contains two g-box-like elements , one t/g-box element  and one t/g-box-like element  , which could potentially be the binding site of slmyc <dig>  the promoter of sltps <dig>  with which slmyc <dig> interacts less strongly, contains one g-box-like element and one t/g-box element . the sltps <dig> promoter, which slmyc can also activate, contains one t/g-box . the sltps <dig> promoter  <cit>  however, does not contain any of these elements, which could indicate the existence of an uncharacterized motif to which slmyc <dig> binds. when using the motif search program meme  <cit>  with all four promoters that slmyc <dig> can activate, one 8 bp motif was identified in the plus or minus  orientation: ctaggg. the validation of a  regulatory element as the binding site for these tfs would require extensive further experimentation. however, since our transactivation assays do not indicate direct binding, the tf-tps promoter interactions observed in the attas, could take place through an additional protein. to address the issue of which terpene synthases  these tfs regulate, we are currently starting the more laborious but more conclusive approach of creating stably transformed silenced and overexpressing plants.

slmyc <dig> acts synergistically with sleot <dig> in the transactivation of the sltps <dig> promoter
interestingly, sleot <dig> and slmyc <dig> acted synergistically in the transactivation of the sltps <dig> promoter . combinatorial control of transcriptional regulation is commonly found in plants and other eukaryotes  <cit> . for example, in abscisic acid  signaling, the 67 bp promoter region of the dehydration-responsive gene rd <dig> contains a myc and a myb recognition site, where atmyc <dig> and atmyb <dig> can bind, respectively. in arabidopsis leaf protoplasts it was shown that these tfs could individually activate transcription of β-glucuronidase driven by this 67 bp promoter region of rd <dig> and that the transient activation was stronger when atmyc <dig> and atmyb <dig> were combined  <cit> . transgenic plants overexpressing these tfs each showed aba hypersensitivity but the effect was more profound in plants overexpressing both tfs  <cit> .

given the fact that slmyc <dig> and sleot <dig> are not induced by ja  and yet the proteins can transactivate the ja-inducible sltps <dig> promoter indicates that they could be regulating the steady-state transcription of sltps <dig>  these tfs might however also be involved in the enhanced sltps <dig> expression by interacting with other, inducible tf. from the well-studied cases of transcriptional regulation in catharanthus roseus and arabidopsis  <cit>  it has becomes clear that it usually involves a network of tfs. in solanum lycopersicum we are only just starting to unravel the complexity of transcriptional regulation of terpene biosynthesis.
