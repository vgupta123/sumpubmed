BACKGROUND
the tea plant  is cultivated worldwide for the production of nonalcoholic beverages. most tea plants have normal, green leaves. tea plant breeders have developed several cultivars with distinct shoot colors , which have become valuable materials for the production of unique green teas with specific colors and flavors. in anji county of southwestern china, as well as in nearby regions, several cultivars  that produce white leaves are cultivated. ‘anji baicha’ is a green-revertible albino tea cultivar that produces yellow or white shoots at low temperatures. an increase in temperature turns the shoots green  <cit> . inhibiting chloroplast development and chlorophyll accumulation leads to the yellow or white shoots observed during the albescent stages. with increasing temperatures, the chloroplast structure recovers and chlorophyll contents increase, causing the leaves to become green . investigations of another yellow-leaf tea cultivar, ‘zhonghuang 2’, revealed that the chloroplast ultrastructure is disrupted, with poorly stacked grana and lower chlorophyll a and b contents than in the green tea cultivar ‘longjing 43’  <cit> .

several methods have been applied to investigate the mechanism mediating the albino phenotype in ‘anji baicha’ plants. using microarrays, differentially expressed genes  were detected in various albescent stages. most of these genes are related to chlorophyll and protein biosynthesis  <cit> . analyses focused on amplified fragment length polymorphisms have helped identify degs during periodic albinism, including transcription factor genes as well as genes related to ubiquitination, chloroplast biogenesis, signal transduction, stress responses, cell cycles, and carbohydrate and energy metabolism  <cit> . a proteome-level analysis of young leaves at three developmental stages revealed that differentially expressed proteins are mainly involved in activities related to photosynthesis, protein processing, and the metabolism of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur  <cit> .

changes to leaf color in ‘anji baicha’ new shoots during the early spring are accompanied by alterations in metabolite profiles. the metabolites whose production differs between stages are primarily related to carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms and phenylpropanoid and flavonoid biosyntheses. the carbohydrate and amino acid metabolic pathways are the main disturbed pathways during the albescent stages than during the green stage  <cit> . additionally, the abundance of metabolites related to the health effects and sensory qualities of tea varies between developmental stages. during the albescent stage, ‘anji baicha’ leaves contain high concentrations of free amino acids, especially theanine  <cit> , which is a unique free amino acid that accounts for approximately 50 % of the total free amino acid content in tea. it gives tea a unique taste known as “umami”  <cit> . very little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms regulating theanine biosynthesis during the albescent stage of ‘anji baicha’ tea plants.

the low chlorophyll contents of albescent stage ‘anji baicha’ leaves are responsible for the production of unique leaf colors. however, the molecular mechanisms responsible for metabolizing chlorophyll in ‘anji baicha’ leaves during the albescent stage have not been fully characterized. in higher plants, carotenoids perform key functions related to light harvesting and protection against the effects of excessive light  <cit> . tea cultivars with high carotenoid levels produce flavorful teas. during the production of tea, carotenoids are degraded to many flavored volatile compounds that are closely related to tea quality  <cit> . previous studies concluded that the total carotenoid content is lower in ‘anji baicha’ plants during the albescent stage and in chlorina tea plants than in normal green tea cultivars  <cit> . however, the molecular mechanisms influencing carotenoid biosynthesis throughout the color and developmental stages of ‘anji baicha’ tea plants have not been clarified. to resolve these issues, we collected leaf samples from the yellow-green, albescent, and re-greening stages. first, we characterized the global gene expression patterns for each color and developmental stage via rna-sequencing . based on these results, we assembled a complete gene set, including the genes expressed in different stages. second, we identified large sets of unigenes differentially expressed between stages. furthermore, the concentrations of carotenoids, chlorophylls, and theanine in the different stages were analyzed, and the expression patterns of key genes encoding enzymes involved in the metabolism of these compounds were characterized. finally, analyses of the correlation among expression of unigenes and metabolites concentrations were used to identify the key genes regulating the differential biosynthesis of the metabolites associated with carotenoid, chlorophyll, and theanine biosynthetic pathways.

our results revealed the dynamic regulation of metabolite biosynthesis in ‘anji baicha’ leaves during the various color and developmental stages. we have clarified the regulation of gene expression in ‘anji baicha’ leaves during different color and developmental stages, which may be relevant for tea breeding and germplasm improvement.

RESULTS
color changes and development of ‘anji baicha’ leaves in the early spring
in early spring, the color of ‘anji baicha’ new shoots is affected by environmental temperatures. at temperatures below 20 °c, new shoots are yellow-green or white. with increasing temperatures, new shoots gradually turn green. the albino phenotype is closely related to chlorophyll synthesis, which is inhibited at low temperatures and restored when the temperature increases  <cit> . the development of new shoots was divided into three stages based on differences in leaf color . the initial germination period, in which plants consisted of one yellow-green leaf and one bud, was defined as the yellow-green  stage. during this stage, leaves were light green with a yellow edge. as the first leaf developed, it became off-white and only the leaf vein remained green. this period was defined as the albescent  stage. when temperatures increased above 22 °c, leaves grew larger and gradually turned green, similar to the leaves of other tea cultivars. this stage was defined as the re-greening  stage.fig.  <dig> ‘anji baicha’ tea leaves and transcriptome profiles in different stages. a yg, yellow-green leaf; w, white leaf; g, re-greening leaf. details for each tissue are described in the methods section under “plant materials”. b cummerbund was used to analyze the leaf transcript level data from the three analyzed stages . the rna-sequencing samples clustered into three groups of three replicate samples according to these stages. these results indicated that the three biological replicates produced consistent gene expression data at each stage, and that the expression levels of unigenes in leaves differed among stages



rna-sequencing, unigene assembly, and annotation of the ‘anji baicha’ transcriptome
to analyze the leaf transcriptomes at the yg, w, and g stages, nine cdna libraries  were created and sequenced using the illumina hiseq  <dig> platform. the total number of raw reads for the nine samples was 29– <dig> million . additionally, only one sample contained fewer than  <dig> million reads. in total,  <dig> million short reads were generated for the three different stages, and  <dig> million high-quality 100-bp reads were selected for further analysis.table  <dig> overview of the sequencing and assembly of the ‘anji baicha’ transcriptome



based on the high-quality reads, the unigenes were assembled using trinity. ultimately, we obtained  <dig>  unigenes, with average and total lengths of 987 bp and  <dig>  mb, respectively . the unigenes were annotated based on sequence similarities to genes in public databases, including the national center for biotechnology information non-redundant  protein database  <cit> , the arabidopsis information resource   <cit> , kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database  <cit> , and the gene ontology  database  <cit> . we determined that  <dig>  ,  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   unigenes matched sequences in the ncbi-nr, tair, go, and kegg databases, respectively .table  <dig> summary of the annotated unigenes



identification and functional classification of genes differentially expressed among the yellow-green, albescent, and re-greening stages
three independent biological replicates were analyzed for each stage to evaluate the reproducibility of our results. by comparing the read numbers per unigene in each sample, biological replicates of the nine samples were validated using scatter plots generated with cummerbund  <cit> . the plots revealed that the nine rna-seq samples clustered into three groups of three replicate samples according to their specific stage . this result suggests that the three biological replicates generated consistent gene expression results for each stage. our data also indicated that the unigene expression levels in leaves differed among stages.

we detected the expression of up to  <dig>  unigenes in the yg stage,  <dig>  unigenes in the w stage, and  <dig>  unigenes in the g stage. the unigene expression levels were measured in terms of fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads . putative degs were identified considering a false discovery rate  of less than  <dig> . for the pairwise comparisons among the three stages, we detected  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   degs . the greater abundance of degs for the comparison between the yg and g stages than for the other comparisons indicated that the transcriptome profiles of these two stages were much more distinct than those of the other stages .table  <dig> number of differentially expressed genes identified by comparing the gene expression levels between two stages



based on go analysis,  <dig>   and  <dig>   unigenes were involved in metabolic processes  and pigmentation , respectively . an enrichment analysis of the degs revealed the significantly up- or down-regulated go terms between each pair of stages . for the w vs yg comparison, the expression levels of  <dig>  unigenes were significantly up-regulated, while the expression levels of  <dig>  unigenes were significantly down-regulated . the up-regulated degs were enriched in go terms such as glycine dehydrogenase  activity, oxidoreductase activity, photosystem i, terpenoid biosynthetic process, and photosystem i reaction center. in contrast, the down-regulated degs were enriched in the go terms argininosuccinate synthase activity, transcription coactivator activity, arginine biosynthetic process, purine ribonucleoside monophosphate biosynthetic process, ribonucleoside diphosphate reductase activity, and glutamate synthase activity. for the g vs w comparison,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. the up-regulated degs were enriched in go terms such as terpenoid biosynthetic process, vitamin b <dig> biosynthetic process, glycine dehydrogenase  activity, vitamin b <dig> metabolic process, pyridoxal phosphate biosynthetic process, oxidoreductase activity, and glycolipid biosynthetic process. the down-regulated degs were enriched in go terms including beta-fructofuranosidase activity, sucrose alpha-glucosidase activity, gtp catabolic process, diacylglycerol o-acyltransferase activity, acylglycerol o-acyltransferase activity, protein polymerization, glycerolipid biosynthetic process, gtp metabolic process, and aminomethyltransferase activity. for the yg vs g comparison,  <dig>  and  <dig>  unigenes were up- and down-regulated, respectively. the up-regulated degs were enriched in go terms such as oxidoreductase activity, cellular amide metabolic process, glutathione biosynthetic process, gtp cyclohydrolase ii activity, terpenoid biosynthetic process, putrescine biosynthetic process, and sulfate adenylyltransferase activity. the down-regulated degs were enriched in go terms including methionine biosynthetic process, outer membrane, dna replication, oxidoreductase activity, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase activity, and gtp catabolic process.fig.  <dig> gene ontology  classification of unigenes. all unigenes were classified using the biological process, cellular component, and molecular function categories. the y-axis indicates the number and percentage of unigenes assigned to a given go annotation term



terpenoids form a large and diverse class of naturally occurring organic chemicals that are extensively used because of their aromatic qualities. in tea plants, terpenoids serve as the main precursors for the aromatic chemicals in tea, and influence pest resistance. the degs related to terpenoid biosynthesis were up-regulated from the yg stage to the w stage and then to the g stage. the concentrations of terpenoids, including total carotenoids, β-carotene, and lutein, were lower in the albino tea cultivars than in the normal green tea cultivars  <cit> . these findings suggest that the terpenoid biosynthetic process was more active in green tea plant leaves.

the degs between each pair of stages were enriched in genes related to distinct kegg pathways . the top  <dig> kegg pathways corresponding to the most abundant degs are presented in fig. 3a. with the color and developmental changes in leaves from the yg stage to the w stage and then to the g stage, the kegg pathways that were enriched in degs remained essentially unchanged. the shared kegg pathways for the yg vs w, w vs g, and yg vs g comparisons included metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, starch and sucrose metabolism, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, purine metabolism, carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms, and glycolysis or gluconeogenesis. the most abundant up-  or down-regulated  degs between two consecutive stages were assigned to  <dig> individual kegg pathways. the common up-regulated kegg pathways for the w vs yg and g vs w comparisons were related to photosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, nitrogen metabolism, pentose phosphate pathway, and sulfur metabolism. the common down-regulated kegg pathways for the w vs yg and g vs w comparisons were associated with ribosomes, gap junctions, and anthocyanin biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  pathway enrichment of differentially expressed unigenes. a top  <dig> kegg pathways containing the most differentially expressed unigenes. b top  <dig> kegg pathways containing the greatest percentage of up-regulated unigenes from the yellow-green  stage to the albescent  stage, and from the w stage to the re-greening  stage. c top  <dig> kegg pathways containing the greatest percentage of down-regulated unigenes from the yg stage to the w stage, and from the w stage to the g stage. the percentages were calculated relative to the total number of unigenes for a given kegg pathway



in photosynthetic organisms, leaves are the site of photosynthesis or carbon fixation, which make them specialized tissues for light-energy absorption, co <dig> uptake and assimilation, and reduction reactions to form carbohydrates such as glucose. the expression levels of unigenes involved in carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms exhibited distinct patterns during the leaf color and developmental changes occurring from the yg stage to the w stage and then to the g stage . these expression patterns may be responsible for the differences between stages regarding the abundance of metabolites related to carbon fixation  <cit> . the enhanced expression of degs related to photosynthesis may lead to increased carbohydrate synthesis and storage of absorbed energy in the form of starch or sucrose, thereby providing an energy source for tea plant survival and development  <cit> . the degs during the w stage in ‘anji baicha’ tea plants were also related to energy metabolism  <cit> .

the secondary metabolites in tea plants contribute to the rich, clean flavors and nutrient contents of tea  <cit> . these secondary metabolites also have beneficial health effects for humans. our data indicated that the identified degs were related to the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which is consistent with the results of a microarray analysis  <cit> . these observations suggest that the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites is differentially regulated throughout the color and developmental stages in leaves. the degs involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were significantly up-regulated from the yg stage to the w stage and then to the g stage . the total carotenoid contents of albino cultivars are lower than those of normal green tea cultivars  <cit> . the degs associated with carotenoid biosynthesis might affect the differences in the total carotenoid contents between stages.

flavonoids are a group of plant polyphenolic secondary metabolites, which includes flavones, flavonols, isoflavones, flavanones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. the flavan-3-ols, or catechins, are the most prominent flavonoid compounds in tea leaves  <cit> . these compounds contribute to many features that make tea an important part of the human diet. from the yg stage to the w stage, the degs involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were mainly down-regulated . in contrast, from the w stage to the g stage, these degs were mainly up-regulated . while in the pale white shoot of ‘anji baicha’, the degs involved in flavonoid biosynthesis were down-regulated  <cit> . this result was contrary to our study which might be because the different tissues used in the two studies. a previous study revealed that the expression of genes encoding the key flavonoid biosynthesis enzymes decreased during the albescent stage, and that the abundance of most catechins was lower in the albescent stage than in the green stage  <cit> . the dynamic alterations in the expression of the flavonoid biosynthesis-related degs may contribute to the differences in catechin abundance among various color and developmental stages.

carotenoid biosynthesis
carotenoids play vital roles during photosynthesis  <cit>  and serve as precursors to abscisic acid  <cit> . in tea plants, carotenoids are present as yellow pigments in fresh leaves and degrade into flavored terpenoids during the production of black tea  <cit> . gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry  analyses were conducted to determine the concentrations of β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein at different stages. compared with the levels during the g stage, significantly higher β-carotene concentrations were observed in the w stage, while a significantly lower lutein concentration was detected in the yg stage . the β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein concentration trends differed considerably between the yg and g stages. the β-carotene concentration increased from the yg stage to the w stage, and then decreased from the w stage to the g stage. however, the lycopene and lutein concentrations increased from the yg stage to the g stage . changes in carotenoid abundance are related to altered expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes  <cit> . in our database,  <dig> unigenes were annotated as key genes encoding enzymes related to carotenoid biosynthesis . the expression profiles of all degs implicated in carotenoid biosynthesis were hierarchically clustered and plotted in a heat map .fig.  <dig> carotenoid concentrations and carotenoid biosynthesis unigenes at different stages. a the concentrations of β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein were determined at different stages. the asterisk indicates a significant difference between the yg or w stages and the g stage . b carotenoid biosynthesis pathway. the bracketed numbers in red following each gene name indicate the number of corresponding unigenes identified in our database. c all differentially expressed genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis were hierarchically clustered and mapped using the fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads values. colors indicate the normalized signal intensity as defined in the bar



isopentenyl diphosphate  forms the backbone of carotenoids. in the 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate  pathway, ipp is produced from pyruvate and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, with doxp synthase  functioning as the first enzyme in this pathway. in tomato plants, dxs is involved in a regulatory step during carotenoid biosynthesis  <cit> . in arabidopsis thaliana, a dxs mutation results in the inhibition of chloroplast development, a lack of chlorophyll and carotenoids, and an albino phenotype in seedlings  <cit> . in our database, seven candidate unigenes encoded dxs, and the expression levels of three of these unigenes  were significantly different among the various color and developmental stages . two unigenes  were significantly up-regulated in the w stage, while one unigene  was significantly up-regulated in the g stage. in the next carotenoid biosynthesis step, geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase  catalyzes the addition of three ipp molecules to dimethylallyl diphosphate. our database contained five unigenes that were homologous to ggps. two of these unigenes  were significantly up-regulated during the yg stage, while one  was significantly up-regulated in the w stage.

in the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, phytoene synthase  catalyzes the synthesis of phytoene from two ggpp molecules  <cit>  . phytoene synthase is a rate-limiting enzyme of carotenoid biosynthesis in marigold flowers  <cit> , canola  seeds  <cit> , and ripening tomato fruits  <cit> . of the seven candidate psy unigenes identified in our study, the expression levels of three  were significantly up-regulated in the g stage . lycopene β-cyclase  activity results in the addition of a β-ionone ring at each end of the lycopene molecule to generate β-carotene. additionally, lycopene ε-cyclase generates an ε-ring to produce δ-carotene. we detected four unigenes homologous to lcy-b in the tea plant transcriptome, only one of which  was up-regulated in the g stage . in tomato plants, lcy-b is actively expressed in green tissues  <cit> . although lcy-b was highly expressed during the g stage, β-carotene concentrations were lowest in this stage . this inconsistency between the gene expression level and metabolite concentration might be due to post-transcriptional regulation of lcy-b, leading to inhibited enzymatic activity.

zeaxanthin epoxidase  catalyzes the conversion of zeaxanthin to violaxanthin via antheraxanthin  <cit> . we identified five unigene candidates for zep <dig>  only one of which  was expressed more during the g stage than in the other two stages. violaxanthin deepoxidase  converts violaxanthin back to zeaxanthin  <cit> . we did not identify any candidate unigenes for vde, which might not be expressed in the three tea leaf color stages or might be expressed at levels below the limit of detection. there are two types of neoxanthin synthase  in plants. one is nearly identical to lycopene β-cyclase, which can convert lycopene into β-carotene and violaxanthin into neoxanthin. the other form can only convert violaxanthin to neoxanthin  <cit> . in our database, the sequences of two unigenes  were highly similar to that of nxs, but neither unigene exhibited significantly different expression levels among the three analyzed stages.

we calculated the spearman’s correlation coefficients between the expression levels of degs and concentrations of β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein at each stage. the expression levels of many unigenes were significantly correlated with metabolite concentrations . we identified one psy-encoding unigene  whose expression level was significantly correlated with β-carotene concentrations. additionally, the expression levels of  <dig> unigenes were significantly correlated with lycopene concentrations. these unigenes encoded dxs, dxr, ispf, ipi, ggps, psy, lcy-b, pds, zds, and zep. we also detected  <dig> unigenes whose expression levels were significantly correlated with lutein concentrations, including unigenes that were annotated as dxs, dxr, ispd, ispf, ipi, ggps, psy, lcy-b, pds, zds, and zep. these unigenes might be responsible for the differences in carotenoid biosynthesis during the various ‘anji baicha’ leaf color and developmental stages.table  <dig> correlation coefficients between expression levels of differentially expressed carotenoid biosynthetic pathway unigenes and concentrations of β-carotene, lycopene, and lutein

chlorophyll biosynthesis
chlorophylls are essential for photosynthesis, light harvesting, and energy transduction. additionally, chlorophylls are mg2+-containing tetrapyrrole pigments responsible for turning plants green. the albino phenotype in tea plants is a result of a lack of chlorophylls during shoot development. in the early spring, the development of chloroplasts from etioplasts and the accumulation of chlorophylls a and b are blocked in the new shoots of ‘anji baicha’ tea plants  <cit> . the chlorophyll a and b concentrations were determined at each stage. compared with those of the g stage, the chlorophyll concentrations in the w and yg stages were significantly lower . additionally, the chlorophyll a and b concentrations decreased from the yg stage to the w stage, and then increased from the w stage to the g stage .fig.  <dig> chlorophyll concentrations and the related unigenes. a the chlorophyll a and b concentrations were determined at different stages. the asterisk indicates a significant difference between the yg or w stages and the g stage . b chlorophyll biosynthesis pathway. the bracketed numbers in red following each gene name indicate the number of corresponding unigenes identified in our database. c all differentially expressed genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis were hierarchically clustered and mapped using the fragments per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads values. colors indicate the normalized signal intensity as defined in the bar



the chlorophyll metabolic pathway includes the following three phases: biosynthesis of chlorophyll a, interconversion between chlorophylls a and b, and degradation of chlorophyll a . in our database,  <dig> unigenes were related to chlorophyll biosynthesis, including the genes for almost all of the key enzymes . the expression levels of the degs were determined via a hierarchical cluster analysis . the expression levels of the gene encoding geranylgeranyl diphosphate reductase , which is an enzyme involved in chlorophyll b biosynthesis, are elevated in plants with insufficient amounts of chlorophyll b  <cit> . two cao unigenes  were identified in our database, and both were significantly up-regulated in the g stage. this finding implies that high cao expression levels might induce the efficient biosynthesis of chlorophyll b to increase its concentration during the g stage . nyc <dig> encodes chlorophyll b reductase, which catalyzes the degradation of chlorophyll b to 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a  <cit> . the degradation of chlorophyll b is suppressed in nyc <dig> mutant plants, which remain green until just before death due to natural senescence  <cit> . three nyc <dig> unigenes were detected in our database, and the expression levels of two of these  were significantly higher in the w stage than in the yg and g stages. high nyc <dig> unigene expression levels during the w stage might enhance the degradation of chlorophyll b . in plants, the nol  protein is closely related to nyc <dig>  and nol mutant plants also remain green, similar to wild-type plants  <cit> . three nol unigenes were identified in our database, but the expression levels of these unigenes were not significantly different between the yg and g stages. hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a reductase  converts 7-hydroxymethyl chlorophyll a to chlorophyll a  <cit> . the hcar expression levels are strongly correlated with chlorophyll content in carnation flower petals  <cit> . additionally, hcar expression is strongly up-regulated during the stage in which etiolated a. thaliana seedlings turn green  <cit> . these results suggest that hcar is essential for chlorophyll turnover during the greening stage. three hcar unigenes were identified in our database, and only one  was significantly up-regulated during the g stage. high expression levels of this unigene in the g stage might contribute to the higher chlorophyll a concentrations during this stage compared with the other two stages . pheophytinase  has a key function in chlorophyll degradation. the expression of pph is induced in darkness, which accelerates chlorophyll degradation. in pph mutant plants, chlorophyll degradation is inhibited, and the plants exhibit a sustained green phenotype during senescence  <cit> . in our study, the expression of pph  was lower in the yg stage than in the w and g stages , suggesting the lowest chlorophyll a degradation rate occurred during the yg stage. however, the chlorophyll a concentration in the yg stage was lower than that during the g stage. this may have been because the expression level for unigene  <dig>  which encodes chlorophyll synthase , was significantly higher in the g stage than in the yg stage . the higher chlorophyll a concentration in the g stage than in the yg stage might be because chlorophyll a was synthesized faster than it was degraded. chlorophyllase  catalyzes the conversion of chlorophyll a to chlorophyllide a. in citrus plants, clh expression levels are negatively correlated with chlorophyll contents  <cit> . we identified six candidate clh unigenes in our database , four of which were significantly differentially expressed between the yg and g stages. the expression levels of unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> were up-regulated during the yg and w stages, respectively, while two unigenes were up-regulated in the g stage  . unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> might contribute to chlorophyll a degradation to lower the chlorophyll concentration more during the yg and w stages than in the g stage. the expression levels of pao, which encodes pheophorbide a oxygenase, are closely correlated with the rate of chlorophyll breakdown  <cit> . three pao unigenes were detected in our database, but only one  was significantly up-regulated from the yg stage to the g stage. however, the chlorophyll content in the g stage was relatively high . identical results were reported for carnations  <cit> , potentially because the post-transcriptional regulation of pao inhibits the activity of the encoded enzyme  <cit>  or because chlorophyll a is synthesized faster than it is degraded.fig.  <dig> theanine biosynthesis pathway and the related unigenes. a the glutamine, glutamate, alanine, ethylamine, and theanine concentrations were determined at different stages. the double asterisks indicate a significant difference between the yg or w stages and the g stage . b theanine biosynthesis pathway. the

spearman’s correlation coefficients between the expression levels of degs and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b were calculated for each stage. the expression levels of two and three unigenes were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a and b concentrations, respectively . the pora  expression levels were significantly correlated with chlorophyll a concentrations. the expression of two unigenes  encoding nyc <dig> was significantly correlated with the concentration of chlorophylls a and b. these unigenes might be responsible for the differences in the biosynthesis of chlorophylls a and b among the different leaf color and developmental stages of ‘anji baicha’ tea plants.table  <dig> correlation coefficients between expression levels of differentially expressed chlorophyll biosynthetic pathway unigenes and concentrations of chlorophylls a and b

theanine biosynthesis
theanine synthetase  catalyzes the synthesis of theanine from glutamic acid and ethylamine  <cit>  . additional enzymes involved in theanine biosynthesis include glutamate synthase  and alanine decarboxylase , which catalyze the conversion of glutamine to glutamate and alanine to ethylamine, respectively. glutamine synthetase  is highly homologous to ts, and can also catalyze the conversion of glutamic acid and ethylamine to theanine  <cit> . ultra-performance liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry  analyses were conducted to determine the concentrations of glutamine, glutamate, alanine, and theanine. additionally, gc-tof-ms was used to measure the ethylamine concentration at different stages. except for ethylamine, all metabolites were detected at significantly higher concentrations in the yg and w stages than in the g stage . the glutamine and glutamate concentrations decreased from the yg stage to the g stage. in contrast, the alanine and theanine concentrations increased from the yg stage to the w stage, and then decreased from the w stage to the g stage .

all unigenes involved in theanine biosynthesis were identified . the degs related to theanine biosynthesis were hierarchically clustered and plotted in a heat map . the g stage consisted of many highly expressed degs, including all unigenes encoding the key enzymes in the theanine biosynthesis pathway. these results suggest that the g stage is an important phase for theanine biosynthesis. one substrate in the theanine biosynthesis pathway is ethylamine, which is produced via the decarboxylation of alanine by aida  <cit> . because the aida gene are specific to tea plant and has not been identified and functionally characterized, the aida genes used in our study encoded arginine decarboxylases, and contained domains similar to those in aida  <cit> . a total of five putative aida unigenes were identified. among them, two  were significantly up-regulated in the yg stage, while the remaining three  were significantly up-regulated in the g stage. another substrate in the theanine biosynthesis pathway is glutamate, which is produced from glutamine by gogat. in our database,  <dig> putative gogat unigenes were identified. two of these unigenes  were significantly up-regulated in the yg stage, and four unigenes  were significantly up-regulated during the g stage. these results indicated that there are differences in the expression patterns of unigenes from the same family. additionally, high unigene expression levels do not necessarily correspond to high metabolite concentrations. increased glutamate levels lead to up-regulated theanine biosynthesis in tea seedlings  <cit> . in our study, both glutamate and theanine were significantly more abundant in the w and yg stages than in the g stage. a previous study reported that glutamate and theanine concentrations are higher in albino cultivars than in normal green cultivars  <cit> . glutamate also participates in chlorophyll synthesis   <cit> . the suppression of chlorophyll biosynthesis during the w stage might lead to elevated levels of glutamate, thereby increasing theanine biosynthesis. theanine synthetase is unique to tea plants, and  <dig> candidate ts unigenes were identified in our database. eight ts unigenes  were up-regulated, and one  was down-regulated in the g stage. in tea plants, ts genes are highly homologous to gs genes  <cit> . fourteen gs unigenes were identified in our database, six of which were also annotated as ts genes. two of the gs unigenes were significantly up-regulated in the yg stage, while six were significantly up-regulated in the g stage .

we calculated the spearman’s correlation coefficients between expression levels of degs and concentrations of ethylamine, glutamine, and theanine during each stage . the expression level of gogat, which is encoded by unigene  <dig>  was significantly correlated with ethylamine concentrations. the expression levels of five unigenes  were significantly correlated with glutamine concentrations. aida expression levels  were correlated with theanine concentrations. these unigenes might be responsible for the variability in the biosynthesis of the associated metabolites in the different ‘anji baicha’ leaf color and developmental stages.table  <dig> correlation coefficients between expression levels of differentially expressed theanine biosynthetic pathway unigenes and concentrations of ethylamine, glutamine, and theanine

to validate the expression-level changes in degs as reflected by fpkm values in different stages, we selected  <dig> unigenes  and analyzed their expression levels in the yg, w, and g stages using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction . pearson’s correlation coefficients were used to determine the correlations of the gene expression level fold-changes between each pair of examined stages as measured by rna-seq and qrt-pcr. the results revealed strong correlations  between the rna-seq and qrt-pcr data . these observations indicated that the gene expression changes as detected by rna-seq reflect the transcriptome profile differences between stages.fig.  <dig> verification of rna-sequencing results using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction  assays. forty-two differentially expressed genes were selected from the carotenoid, chlorophyll, and theanine biosynthesis pathways. scatter diagrams show the correlations of the log ratios  of the unigene expression levels as measured by qrt-pcr and rna-sequencing. the qrt-pcr data were normalized using the ‘housekeeping’ gene gapdh. the qrt-pcr primers are listed in additional file 6




CONCLUSIONS
we completed a transcriptome-level analysis of ‘anji baicha’ tea plants at different color and developmental stages. the transcriptome profiles differed considerably among the yg, w, and g stages. the differentially expressed unigenes were mainly related to metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, and carbon fixation in photosynthetic organisms. chemical analyses revealed the theanine and β-carotene levels were higher and the chlorophyll a levels were lower in the w stage than in the g stage. furthermore, we identified unigenes associated with carotenoid, chlorophyll, and theanine biosyntheses, and the expression patterns of the differentially expressed unigenes implicated in these pathways were characterized. analyses of gene expression levels and metabolite contents enabled the identification of key unigenes whose expression levels may significantly affect metabolite concentrations. these results revealed the relationship between gene expression and the biosynthesis of carotenoids, chlorophyll, and theanine. our findings have helped to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of characteristic biochemicals in albino tea plants. the transcriptome-level data generated in this study may be a valuable resource for further molecular and genomic studies of albino tea plants.
