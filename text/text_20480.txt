BACKGROUND
oogonia entering meiosis progress to the diplotene stage of the first meiotic prophase, at which they display a characteristic nucleus commonly known as the germinal vesicle . oocytes arrested at the gv stage, prophase i of meiosis, enter a growth phase during which the follicle differentiates from the primary to the preovulatory stage. oocytes acquire the capacity to resume meiosis during this period and rely on 3'5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate  to prevent premature resumption. cyclic amp is produced in the somatic granulosa cells and transferred through gap-junction channels  <cit> . recent findings have shown that camp-producing capacity is also important in maintaining the prophase i-arrested state in oocytes  <cit> . cyclic amp activates the camp-dependent protein kinase  by binding to the two regulatory subunits, liberating the two active catalytic subunits. high concentrations of camp and correspondingly high pka activity within the oocyte prevent the resumption of meiosis, as shown using camp analogues  <cit> , adenylyl cyclase activators  <cit>  and invasive adenylyl cyclase treatments  <cit> . microinjection of xenopus oocytes with the catalytic subunit of pka also maintains them in the gv stage  <cit> . however, the pka-mediated mechanism that maintains meiotic arrest is not fully understood, although interesting advances have recently been made on possible pka targets in mouse oocytes, such as cdc25b phosphatase and wee1b kinase, two cell cycle regulators  <cit> .

cyclic amp is degraded by members of the phosphodiesterase  family  <cit> . pdes are important regulators of ovarian physiology. during the past few years, pde <dig> family-specific inhibitors  have been shown to block the resumption of meiosis efficiently in murine  <cit> , rat  <cit> , bovine  <cit> , porcine  <cit> , macaque  <cit>  and human  <cit>  oocytes. pde3a- and pde4d-null female mice respectively show infertility and impaired fertility  <cit> . interestingly, pde3a-deficient mice ovulate fully-grown oocytes, but they fail to resume meiosis  <cit> . in rat oocytes, a camp-degrading activity sensitive to cilostamide  is increased 2-fold prior to resumption of meiosis, strongly suggesting that camp degradation is actively regulated in the oocyte and that regulation of pde3a is part of the mechanism controlling resumption of meiosis  <cit> .

nuclear maturation in the oocyte and rupture of the follicle are triggered by an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins in vivo. the latter is characterized by breakdown of the germinal vesicle . gvbd is correlated with an increased activity of m phase-promoting factor . mpf is essential for gvbd, chromosome condensation, formation of microtubules around the condensed chromosomes and their organization into a bipolar structure  <cit> . the complete molecular pathways linking the endocrine cues to the first activation of mpf in the oocyte during nuclear maturation are unclear. however, it is known that gonadotropins trigger multiple phosphorylation cascades and second messenger signalling pathways in the somatic compartment of the ovarian follicle, and these are critical for the correct timing of oocyte maturation. simultaneously with activation of the mpf, mitogen-activated protein kinase  activates phosphorylation in the oocyte and is believed to be implicated in chromosome condensation and microtubule organisation  <cit> . after its initial increase, mpf activity stays high until metaphase i before decreasing prior to homologous chromosome segregation and extrusion of the first polar body  <cit> . a second increase in mpf activity maintains metaphase ii prior to sperm penetration. although this second activation is known to depend on factors such as cyclin b synthesis, presence of the nucleus and mapk activity, the precise implication of the pde3a/camp/pka pathway remains unknown  <cit> . our laboratory has recently described physiological evidence showing the pivotal role of camp and its modulation by pde <dig> in regulating the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes  <cit> . since no study has reported the progression of pde <dig> activity during porcine oocyte nuclear maturation, the goal of the present study was to measure pde <dig> activity in the oocyte during in vitro maturation  and to characterize the effect of pde <dig> inhibition on different steps of nuclear maturation.

RESULTS
contributions of different camp-degrading pdes in the oocyte
the pde assay was optimized for porcine coc. increasing numbers of coc were used to measure camp hydrolysis. the hydrolytic activity was linearly related to the number of coc and  <dig> coc or denuded oocytes were used . in experiment  <dig>  camp-degrading pde <dig> activity was measured in cumulus-oocyte complexes  after recovery from the ovary with or without pde inhibitors. the total camp-pde activity in porcine coc was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol camp degraded/min/coc, and this activity was decreased by non-specific and family-specific pde inhibitors. figure 1a shows that 66% of the camp-degrading pde activity is inhibited by the non-specific inhibitor 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine , while 19% and 7% inhibition are achieved, respectively, by pde3-specific  and pde4-specific  inhibitors . ibmx inhibits every camp-pde subtype except for pde <dig>  the ibmx-sensitive , cilostamide-sensitive  and rolipram-sensitive  activities were calculated as described in the experimental design section and reported in figure 1b. the camp-degrading pde activity in the oocyte was  <dig>  ±  <dig>  fmol camp degraded/min/oocyte . cyclic amp-pde <dig> activity measured in the denuded oocyte was almost equivalent to the total activity. moreover, these two activities are similar to the camp-pde <dig> specific activity measured in coc , suggesting that pde <dig> is the predominant pde isoform in porcine oocytes. pde3a mrna was detected in the oocyte by rt-pcr . to confirm the identity of the amplification products further, they were sequenced and found to be  <dig> %,  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % identical to published porcine, human, mouse and rat sequences, respectively.

in experiment  <dig>  oocytes were cultured as coc. at the end of the culture, the cumulus cells were removed by gentle pipetting and after several washes the oocytes were assessed for camp-degrading activity. pde <dig> activity in the oocyte was measured at different time points during ivm. no statistically significant effect of either total, ibmx-sensitive or cilostamide-sensitive  phosphodiesterase activities was observed during ivm . however, maximum pde activity was measured at  <dig> hours of ivm, after which the activity returned to basal level.

time-dependent ability of specific pde <dig> inhibition to maintain coc in meiotic arrest
the efficacy of the pde <dig> inhibitor, cilostamide, in controlling gvbd was tested. in the previous experiments, specific pde <dig> inhibitors were added at the beginning of ivm  <cit> . in experiment  <dig>  the addition of cilostamide was postponed for several hours after the beginning of ivm. the inhibitor was still efficient at controlling gvbd when added after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm . when pde <dig> inhibition with cilostamide was still further delayed there was a gradual decrease in its control of gvbd . a linear regression calculation showed that 50% of the coc remain in gv when pde <dig> is inhibited at  <dig>  hours, which is approximately  <dig> hours prior to gvbd  and  <dig> hours after the peak of pde activity in the oocyte . as shown in figure 3b, most of the oocytes resumed meiosis normally under our culture conditions within a narrow window of  <dig> hours between  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm . this result suggests that the camp-pde <dig> pathway actively controls maintenance of the gv stage during at least the first  <dig> hours of ivm. after  <dig> hours of cilostamide-free culture conditions, the addition of cilostamide for the last  <dig> hours had no significant effect on maintaining the oocytes in the gv stage . in addition, maximum pde <dig> activity occurs at approximately  <dig> hours of ivm , which is  <dig> hours prior to the end of period in which pde <dig> inhibition can prevent gvbd. at  <dig> hours, camp-pde <dig> activity is minimal , consistent with its inefficacy in controlling gvbd.

mpf activation is critical for the resumption of oocyte meiosis. as proposed above, the period preceding gvbd is camp-pde3-sensitive. since mpf activity during ivm in vertebrate oocytes changes biphasically before reaching the second meiotic arrest in metaphase ii, experiment  <dig> was designed to verify whether the second mpf activation depends on camp-pde <dig> activity. pde <dig> was inhibited with cilostamide after  <dig> hours of ivm and meiotic maturation was assessed immediately and at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hours afterwards. of the cilostamide-treated coc,  <dig> % resumed meiosis during  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm  while  <dig> % remained in gv arrest . the cilostamide-insensitive oocytes reached an intermediate nuclear stage at  <dig> hours . of this group, 40% reached the mature nuclear stage at  <dig> hours, equivalent to the control oocytes . this result suggests that oocytes that resume meiosis despite pde <dig> inhibition, the cilostamide-insensitive group, reach the mature nuclear stage at a similar rate to their control counterparts and therefore are not affected by pde <dig> inhibition. the significantly higher percentages of oocytes in gv arrest at  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours compared to control oocytes reveal that cilostamide treatment transiently maintained the cilostamide-sensitive oocytes in meiotic arrest . the significantly lower percentage of oocytes at an intermediate nuclear stage at  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours is the result of the delay in meiotic resumption for 30% of the oocytes . the transition of oocytes from intermediate to mature stage at  <dig> and  <dig> hours is not compromised, since similar percentages of treated and untreated oocytes reach the mature stage at  <dig> hours . the delay in resumption of meiosis caused by cilostamide treatment can still be observed at  <dig> hours in the percentage of oocytes at the mature nuclear stage . however, oocytes under both treatments have completed meiotic maturation by  <dig> hours, showing that the effect of late pde3-specific inhibition on resumption and progression of meiosis is transient and fully reversible. these results suggest that pde <dig> inhibition affects gvbd under normal ivm conditions, but without affecting the progression of meiosis after its resumption until metaphase ii arrest.

effects of short oa exposure in the presence of pde <dig> inhibition on oocyte nuclear maturation
the protein phosphatase 1/2a -specific inhibitor okadaic acid  has previously been used to stimulate chromatin condensation and premature gvbd in vertebrate oocytes  <cit> . in experiment  <dig>  oocytes treated continuously with oa  displayed significantly lower levels of arrest than control oocytes  at  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm . to study the effect of pde3-specific inhibition on premature gvbd in oa-treated oocytes, oocytes were exposed to both cilostamide and oa for  <dig> hours of ivm. as reported previously, pde <dig> inhibition by cilostamide prevents gvbd under normal ivm conditions   <cit> . however, pde <dig> inhibition no longer prevented gvbd in continuously oa-exposed oocytes . even when oa addition was delayed for  <dig> hours, pde <dig> inhibition did not prevent gvbd . these results clearly suggest that inhibition of pp1/2a with oa affects the gvbd signalling cascade downstream of camp-pde3a in pig oocytes.

because continuous oa exposure causes meiotic spindle assembly defects and disperses the condensed chromosome configuration at the intermediate nuclear stage  instead of the normal metaphase i configuration   <cit> , a transient exposure of oocytes to oa was used in experiment  <dig>  as shown in figure 6a, comparable intermediate nuclear stages could be observed at  <dig> hours in the continuously oa-treated and in the  <dig> hours oa-treated oocytes, while in the  <dig> hour oa-treated group the oocytes were still at the gv stage, as in the control group. moreover, the  <dig> hours oa-treated group had a minimal percentage of oocytes with dispersed bivalent chromatin compared with the group continuously exposed for  <dig> hours . when assessed after  <dig> hours of ivm, the control and one hour oa-treated groups both displayed a high percentage of intermediate nuclear maturation stage oocytes . meiosis did not progress significantly between  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm in continuously oa-exposed oocytes and still displayed a high percentage at the intermediate nuclear stage with a disperse chromatin configuration . oocytes exposed for  <dig> hours to oa displayed  <dig>  ±  <dig> % of oocytes in the mature stage, indicating that they may progress through the intermediate stage. considering these results, the next experiments were undertaken using transient  exposure to oa.

experiment  <dig> was designed to determine the effect of pde <dig> inhibition on  <dig> hours oa-treated oocytes. as with continuous oa treatment , pde <dig> inhibition no longer prevented gvbd in transiently oa-treated oocytes . these results also show that coc treated with oa for  <dig> hours have a higher percentage of mature stage oocytes at  <dig> hours . pde <dig> inhibition in  <dig> hours oa-treated coc affected meiosis by maintaining oocytes at the intermediate nuclear maturation stage . these results suggest that inhibition of camp-pde <dig> slows the progression of meiosis to the mature stage, consistent with a role in mpf activation.

in experiment  <dig>  to understand the preceding findings further, the nuclear stage was assessed every  <dig> hours up to  <dig> hours of ivm after the treatments described above. pde <dig> inhibition of coc caused a significantly higher percentage of gv stage oocytes after  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  hours of ivm than in controls . it also prevented the increase of intermediate  and mature  stage oocytes . a transient oa exposure  triggered a rapid loss of gv stage oocytes after  <dig> hours of ivm  and a significantly higher rate of mature stage oocytes after  <dig> hours of ivm compared to the control group . pde <dig> inhibition of  <dig> hours oa-treated coc did not affect the decline in gv stage oocyte percentage after  <dig> or  <dig> hours of ivm . consistent with results in figure  <dig>  pde <dig> inhibition of  <dig> hours oa-treated oocytes allowed intermediate stage oocytes to accumulate and the appearance of mature stage oocytes to be delayed after  <dig> hours of ivm in comparison to oa-treated oocytes . these results suggest that inhibition of camp-pde <dig> transiently affects the progression of meiosis in  <dig> hours oa-treated oocytes.

discussion
this study demonstrates that in porcine oocytes, pde3a is the major active camp-pde; it efficiently regulates the resumption of meiosis until  <dig> hours before gvbd and transiently affects meiotic progression. four lines of evidence support this conclusion:  cilostamide-sensitive camp-pde activity in the oocyte represents the main camp-pde activity;  pde3a mrna was detected in oocyte cdna by rt-pcr;  pde <dig> inhibition after  <dig> hours of ivm still prevents the resumption of meiosis;  pde <dig> inhibition delays nuclear maturation in oa-treated oocytes.

total and cilostamide-sensitive  pde activities in porcine coc and denuded oocytes freshly recovered from the ovary  were about the same as reported for mouse and rat oocytes  <cit> . furthermore, pde <dig> is the predominant pde activity in the oocyte , as reported for rodents  <cit> . this result is also consistent with the presence of pde3a protein detected by western blotting in porcine oocytes  <cit> . pde3a messenger rna was detected in the oocyte by in situ hybridization in rat and by rt-pcr in mouse and these findings are consistent with the presence of pde3a mrna in porcine oocyte   <cit> . the reported levels of camp during ivm range from  <dig> to  <dig> fmol  <cit> , whereas the level of camp-degrading activity in denuded porcine oocytes reported in this study is around  <dig>  fmol of camp degraded per minute per oocyte throughout ivm . these results suggest that porcine oocytes replenish their camp content approximately every minute. under our culture conditions, despite the maximum at  <dig> hours, total and cilostamide-sensitive  phosphodiesterase activities were not statistically different during ivm . one explanation could be that the timing of gvbd is regulated by multiple camp-generating mechanisms. the modulation of camp level in the oocyte involves both the permeability of the gap-junctions and adenylyl cyclase activity  <cit> . in addition, the present results do not exclude a possible modulation of pde3a activity by phosphorylation, which would be difficult to measure because highly synchronized gvbd oocytes would be needed. in the rat, a clear increase of pde3a activity occurs  <dig> minutes prior to gvbd  <cit> . in the pig, the present study shows a peak in camp-pde <dig> activity  <dig> hours before gvbd and a loss of the capacity of a pde3-specific inhibitor to prevent the resumption of meiosis  <dig> hours before gvbd. control of oocyte pde activity has been reported in xenopus, where microinjection of constitutively active pkb has been shown to increase activity and the gvbd rate  <cit> . implication of pkb in the modulation of pde activity remains a possible mechanism for the resumption of meiosis. from the  <dig> putative pka and pkb serine phosphorylation sites in the n-terminus of the murine pde3a protein sequence  described by shitzukawa and coworkers  <cit> ,  <dig> are present in rat , pig  and human . in the other gene of the same family, pde3b, at least two of these sites are conserved between rodents and human, and serine- <dig> is reportedly targeted by pka and pkb in vitro  <cit> . pde <dig> has also been reported to be activated by partially purified mapk and pkb in rat hepatocytes  <cit> . pkb activation prior to gvbd has never been shown in pig oocytes.

because camp is probably involved in controlling re-entry into the cell cycle in oocytes, the next step was to investigate the role of camp in meiotic progression. it was confirmed that oa treatment overcame pde3-specific inhibition, suggesting that pp1/2a inhibition activates signalling molecules downstream of camp-pde <dig> in the pig oocyte . this hypothesis is supported by previous reports showing that ibmx-arrested or milrinone -arrested mouse oocytes resume meiosis when pp1/2a is inhibited with oa  <cit> . in the latter study, pde <dig> inhibition of oa-treated oocytes delayed gvbd and reduced mpf activation  <cit> . interestingly, when using a spontaneous denuded oocyte maturation model, pde <dig> inhibition of  <dig> hours oa-treated oocytes result in higher rates of intermediate stage oocyte compared to oa-treated oocytes alone after  <dig> hours of ivm . these results support our findings, showing that pde <dig> inhibition affects meiotic progression in oa-treated oocytes probably by delaying the decrease of mpf activity that allows nuclear maturation to be completed .

in vertebrates, the direct mpf regulators cdc25b and myt <dig> are candidate targets for pp1/2a  <cit> . in fission and budding yeasts, a specific form of pp2a  directly protects centromeric cohesins from phosphorylation and cleavage, preventing premature sister chromatin separation  <cit> . the cohesion of centromeres in sister chromatids during metaphase i is of critical importance. in the present study, fifty percent of oocytes remained at the intermediate stage after  <dig> and  <dig> hours of ivm , suggesting that inhibition of pp1/2a with oa affects the segregation machinery in a way that impairs homologous chromosome segregation without causing complete meiotic spindle dissolution . similarly, transient pp1/2a inhibition with a relatively high dose of oa  compromised anaphase initiation and stopped meiosis in metaphase i in mouse oocytes, while low doses  allowed normal meiosis to continue until metaphase ii arrest but with high rates of chromosomal abnormalities  <cit> . in the present study, the transient oa exposure approach allowed meiosis to proceed to the mature stage. this approach was used successfully in a previous study to reduce the incidence of chromosome segregation defects and to improve the percentage of oocytes reaching metaphase ii compared to the continuously oa-treated group  <cit> .

wang and coworkers have shown that pka inhibition is one of the earliest events in progesterone-induced resumption of meiosis in xenopus oocytes  <cit> . our results suggest that effective pka inhibition occurs late after the start of ivm, since stimulation of the camp/pka pathway by pde <dig> inhibition after  <dig> hours of ivm prevents gvbd completely . pde <dig> inhibition after  <dig> hours of ivm has no effect on the completion of meiosis . in xenopus, a similar experiment also demonstrated that reactivating the camp/pka pathway after gvbd has no effect on the completion of meiosis  <cit> . oa-stimulated oocytes react differently by being delayed at an intermediate stage in the presence of the pde <dig> inhibitor . the reason for this is unclear; however, the capacity of the cumulus cells to transfer camp to the oocyte could explain the effect. pde <dig> inhibition, combined with insufficient camp transfer, could prevent intracellular camp levels reaching a certain threshold and compromise pka activation. the level of connexin  <dig> and its phosphorylation status have been shown to vary in porcine cumulus cells during ivm  <cit> . cyclic amp has also been shown to inhibit proteasomal proteolysis in rat sertoli cells, cos- <dig> african monkey kidney cells and y <dig> mouse adrenocortical tumour cells  <cit> . interestingly, porcine oocytes stop their nuclear maturation in metaphase i when proteasomal degradation is inhibited  <cit> . it is possible that pde <dig> inhibition in oa-treated oocytes leads to a rise in camp level sufficient to prevent proteasomal degradation and consequently delays the transition from intermediate to mature stage. the mechanism by which pde <dig> inhibition maintains oocytes in the intermediate stage under oa-treated conditions will require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, the present investigation has revealed new insights into camp regulation during the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes. it has demonstrated that pde3a is the major camp-degrading pde activity and regulates meiotic resumption until  <dig> hours prior to gvbd. it has also demonstrated that pde <dig> inhibition affects meiotic progression in oa-treated oocytes. we suggest that camp-pde3a modulates meiotic resumption via a factor located upstream of pp1/2a substrates. this study highlights a distinctive characteristic of porcine oocyte nuclear maturation that makes it a valuable model for studying camp modulation during maturation: the very long latency period before the resumption of oocyte meiosis and the late release of the control maintained by the camp-pde <dig> pathway over prophase arrest. further experiments will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of pde3a activity during ivm and the fundamental role of the camp/pka pathway in the molecular mechanisms leading to meiotic maturation.
