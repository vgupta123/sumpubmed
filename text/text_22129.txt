BACKGROUND
the genus leptospira comprises a heterogeneous group of saprophytic and pathogenic species belonging to the order spirochaetales  <cit> . pathogenic leptospira spp., including l. interrogans, l. kirschneri, l. noguchii, l. borgpetersenii, l. santarosai, l. weilii, and etc.  <cit> , are etiological agents of leptospirosis. they are excreted in urine of the infected animals and may penetrate the human body through skin or mucous membranes when the host contacts with contaminated water or soil  <cit> . because of the wide spectrum of animal species that serve as reservoirs, leptospirosis is considered the most widely spread zoonotic disease  <cit> .

the genus leptospira, including pathogenic and saprophytic species, can be further classified into serological types, i.e., serogroups and serovars, defined by a cross-agglutination absorption test. the alternative genotypic classification is based on dna hybridization and thus, the leptospires can be assigned to the species level  <cit> . however, these two classification systems are not always consistent. strains belonging to the same serovar may belong to different leptospira species and vice versa  <cit> .

l. interrogans serovar lai is a virulent serovar of serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae, which is more likely to cause severe leptospirosis than the other serovars prevailing in china  <cit> . following the determination of the complete genomic sequence of the l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai  in  <dig>  <cit> , the genome of another l. interrogans serovar copenhageni strain fiocruz l1- <dig> of the same serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae was sequenced and released  <cit> . genomic comparison of strain lai with strain fiocruz l1- <dig> revealed extensive variation in the number and distribution of insertion sequences and other genomic contents  <cit> , which should eventually determine the unique phenotypes of each strain.

although whole-genome sequencing is a powerful method of genetics and genomics, it is still laborious and expensive. recently, comparative genomic hybridization  has been used to facilitate the comparison of unsequenced bacterial genomes in order to monitor the gene contents of closely related bacterial species  <cit> . based on the genomic sequence of l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai, we constructed a microarray to compare the genomes of a number of l. interrogans serovars in order to clarify their genetic relationship and identify features that may serve as molecular markers to profile the serovars or genospeices, which may correspond to different levels of disease manifestation. eleven l. interrogans strains that are endemic in china were analyzed. sequences absent in l. interrogans were mostly confined to regions in the rfb gene cluster and two genomic islands  of strain lai. the results are discussed in the context of the possible role of these regions in l. interrogans with respect to serovar determination and virulence.

RESULTS
cgh microarray analysis and in silico genomic comparison of l. interrogans serovar lai vs l. interrogans serovar copenhageni
the genomes of two l. interrogans strains, lai and fiocruz l1- <dig> belonging to the same serogroup icterohaemorrhagiae, were completely sequenced in china and brazil respectively  <cit> . the genomic contents of these two strains were compared by cgh employing a strain lai sequence based whole genome cds microarray . the genomic sequences of the two strains were also compared in silico. cdss of strain lai absent in fiocruz l1- <dig> were predicted by a blastn search, and the degree of similarity between the matching tested genomic sequence and the probe itself in terms of the length of match and the percentage sequence identity at the dna level was expressed as h values .

for cgh analysis with dna microarray slides, it is important to set an appropriate threshold to detect cdss missing from the sample strains. in this study, we compared the h values to the results of cgh between strain lai and fiocruz l1- <dig> expressed by the normalized signal ratio of sample strain/reference strain hybridization . it is clear that the plot of h values of each cds versus its corresponding log <dig> s/r ratio values was divided into two groups defined by the apparent cutoff values of h and the log <dig> ratio. we may define the cutoff h value as  <dig>  because any cds is either absent or significantly divergent in strain fiocruz l1- <dig> from that of strain lai, when h ≤  <dig>  . for the same token, if the h value of a cds is larger than  <dig> , it can be considered a conserved gene. we may also draw the cutoff s/r ratio for hybridization as  <dig>   because this value divides the cdss into two categories almost identical to that of h =  <dig> , except two data points , which is the minimum among all the other possible cutoff values  . in other words, although, for unknown reasons, there were genes with unexpected signal ratios in groups iv and vi, the numbers of such genes were relatively low  and with this cutoff, we may have the minimal  <dig> % false positives  and zero false negatives  among all the other choices .

* among the total of  <dig> cdss array, there were  <dig> invalid data for low quality signal of hybridyzation derived from all of the cgh experiments. that makes the total  <dig> cdss listed in the table.

an s/r ratio of - <dig> on the log <dig> scale was frequently used in previous studies  <cit> . however, for this study, with the threshold value of - <dig>  four conserved genes with h value more than  <dig>  would be designated as absent in strain fiocruz l1- <dig>  therefore, a threshold log <dig> ratio value of - <dig>   determined by the statistical correlation between the s/r ratio and the genomic sequence similarity  of l. interrogans strain lai and strain fiocruz l1- <dig> is more appropriate than the artificial value of - <dig> for detecting the absent/divergent cdss for the l. interrogans strain lai whole genome cds microarray-based cgh studies.

overview of the microarray analysis
the genomic contents of the  <dig> l. interrogans strains were analyzed by cgh using the cdss encoded by the genome of strain lai as reference. the results are shown in fig.  <dig> and additional file  <dig>  of the  <dig>  cdss spotted on the microarray slides,  <dig> were considered absent from at least one of the l. interrogans strains tested. these cdss accounted for  <dig> % of all the cdss of strain lai annotated  <cit>  or  <dig> % of the cdss spotted on the slides. with invalid data excluded , the remaining  <dig>  cdss were likely conserved in all the strains used in this study. there were differences in the numbers of absent cdss for different strains, ranging from  <dig> in strain fiocruz l1- <dig> to  <dig> in strain p <dig> .

sixteen of the  <dig> absent cdss were chosen for confirmation tests with pcr amplification in  <dig> l. interrogans strains. only  <dig> reaction results did not match the cgh results among the  <dig> pcr reactions. moreover, we also validated the cgh results by comparing them to the publicly available sequence variation data of the rfb loci from five serovars of l. interrogans   <cit>  employing the blastn in silico hybridization method. the two results were well matched and in conclusion, our cgh results are reliable and reasonable.

the distribution of the absent genes indicated that majority of the absent/divergent genes were clustered in three regions . the rfb gene cluster  was previously described  <cit> . the other two regions were referred as gi a  and gi b  respectively. the rest absent genes were scattered over the genome.

the proportions of the absent cdss with respect to their functional category are shown in table  <dig>  genes encoding fundamental cellular functions were relatively conserved , such as translation , energy production and conversion , as well as transport and metabolism for lipid and inorganic ions . in contrast, genes in  <dig> functional categories including cell cycle control and defense mechanisms have over 10% of the cdss absent. approximately  <dig> % of the genes assigned to cell wall biogenesis including sugar biosynthetic enzymes and outer membrane efflux proteins were absent from most of the l. interrogans strains analyzed. approximately  <dig> % of the genes assigned to carbohydrate transport and metabolism and  <dig> % of those assigned to secondary metabolites biosynthesis, transport and catabolism were also missing. one must clarify that genes of the last category mainly encode methyltransferases, which are likely involved in sugar modification. thus, it is not surprising that most of the absent genes in these three categories  were located in the o-antigen  locus.

* functional categories of strain lai cdss were based on information from the genbank database  <cit> .

# some of the cdss were not include in any of the categories, while some other cdss may belong to more than one category. therefore, the sum of the absent genes for individual category does not equal to the total number of the absent cdss

structure and function of the genomic islands
three bacteriophages of the saprophytic l. biflexa were first isolated by saint girons et al.  <cit> . these bacteriophages do not infect representative species of pathogenic leptospires. however, evidence for horizontal transfer of dna among l. interrogans  came from studies of the intervening sequences found within the 23s rrna gene  <cit>  and from the finding that the leptospiral lipopolysaccharide biosynthetic locus  is located in a genomic island that was probably acquired through horizontal transfer from gram-negative source  <cit> .

three regions with large sets of missing cdss detected by cgh in the  <dig> l. interrogans strains presented some characteristics of laterally transferred genomic elements. besides the rfb gene cluster, the gc content, genome signature, as well as the codon and amino acid usage bias of the other two missing regions were analyzed along with the chromosomal dna sequence of strain lai   <cit>  to verify their gi characteristics.

the first putative genomic island  is a ~28-kb-long segment of dna encompassing cdss from la <dig> to la <dig>  it begins with an insertion sequence islin <dig> and a transposase   <cit> , and ends with an is <dig> and a transposase gene   <cit> . this region presents many characteristics expected for a typical gi  <cit> :  higher gc content,  altered codon preference,  different amino acid usage pattern, and  genes encoding transposases at the ends .

among the  <dig> cdss included in this region, there are  <dig> cdss without any significant homology to genes in the genbank database. besides the  <dig> proximal genes both encoding transposases, there are  <dig> other genes encoding a transposase, an integrase, a molybdate metabolism regulator and a lipoprotein, respectively.

there are two genes likely related to pathogenesis. la <dig> was found to contain an lrr , which is characteristic for a diverse array of proteins providing a versatile framework for protein-protein interaction  <cit> . it is particularly interesting to notice that, all of the bacterial lrr proteins that have been well characterized so far, including those from listeria monocytogenes  <cit> , streptococcus  <cit> , yersinia pestis  <cit> , salmonella typhimurium  <cit>  and shigella flexneri  <cit> , are implicated in virulence. it was shown to be a major virulence factor in l. monocytogenes presumably functioning as triggering engulfment of the bacterium after specifically interacting with cell-surface receptors  <cit> . on the basis of their sequence similarity, the probable pathogenic function of this gene in l. interrogans serovar lai is worth to be further explored.

another cds, la <dig>  shares amino acid homology with hemin receptor of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, such as the chua of escherichia coli o157:h <dig>  <cit> , hemr of yersinia enterocolitica  <cit> , shua of shigella dysenteriae  <cit> , and hgpb of h. influenzae  <cit> . its contribution to bacterial virulence was proven in uropathogenic e. coli <cit>  and the heme scavenging function of the hemin receptor chua is speculated to depend on the activity of α-hemolysin, which gains access to the intracellular heme reservoir  <cit> . since  <dig> hemolysins were confirmed in strain lai  <cit> , one may speculate that the coupling of hemolysis with heme utilization could serve as an effective iron acquisition strategy during the progression of strain lai infection.

the second large gi  spans almost  <dig> kb, from la <dig> to la <dig>  it is not inserted at the 3' end of a trna gene and it bears no significant variations in its gc content. however, it does have all the expected properties of a typical gi in other aspects. it begins with an insertion element is <dig> and a transposase  <cit> , and ends with a transposase. this island also has large numbers of cdss encoding proteins with unknown functions, but several of others are homologous to the bacteriophage-encoded proteins  and integrases . this indicates that phage-mediated integration events may be involved in the acquisition of this island.

of the  <dig> cdss in the gi b region spotted on the microarray, majority of them were missing from the strains tested . the pattern of the absent genes seemed highly mosaic. further concerning the very low level of variation in its gc content and the presence of multiple transposases, it may suggest that the gi b region is likely a site experienced extensive insertion, excision and recombination and it could be acquired from species with g+c content similar to that of l. interrogans or that the base composition of the acquired dna have gradually adapted to the host genome.

it is particularly interesting that fiocruz l1- <dig> lacks the whole gi b segment except  <dig> genes located at the two ends of this region. this missing region covers a 54-kb dna segment specific to strain lai   <cit> . recently, bourhy and his colleagues named this 54-kb dna region laigi i and demonstrated it can be excised from the chromosome to form a replicative plasmid  <cit> . they also observed imprecise excision of laigi i in l. interrogans serovar lai. this finding may further support the mosaic character of the gi b region detected in different strains of l. interrogans, which is larger than and covers the whole segment of laigi i.

the gi b also contains genes encoding putative regulators. for example, the arac family transcriptional regulator gene  has been shown to regulate diverse bacterial functions including sugar catabolism, response to stress and virulence  <cit> .

horizontal gene transfer plays an important role in the evolution of different bacterial pathotypes  <cit> . the two putative gis found in strain lai contained many divergent genes with several features of pathogenicity and metabolic islands. because these gis are largely missing in other pathogenic l. interrogans spp., they may not encode genes essential for pathogenesis but might contribute, to certain extent, the severe pathogenic properties of serovar lai infection  <cit> .

structure and function of the rfb gene cluster
leptospiral lps plays critical roles in both pathology and immunity during the course of leptospirosis and forms the basis for serological classification of leptospira spp.  <cit> . the o-antigens are synthesized by a set of enzymes encoded by the rfb gene cluster in addition to a few genes scattered over the whole chromosome  <cit> . the nucleotide sequence of the strain lai rfb locus spanning la1576- la <dig> comprises  <dig> kb  <cit> . cgh analysis revealed that although the rfb gene cluster is frequently absent from all strains tested except fiocruz l1- <dig>  its 3'-proximal end is conserved, which spans from la <dig> through to la <dig>  in contrast, the genetic layout at the 5'-proximal end is more variable. because the genes located in this segment of strain lai  were predicted to encode glycosyltransferases and enzymes catalyzing sugar activation, the genetic variations of this segment is likely to cause the variations in lps composition/structure of the tested strains. these results confirmed previous reports that the genetic basis for serological differences among leptospiral svs were related to the presence of specific sugar-biosynthetic or -modifying genes in their respective rfb loci  <cit> .

in addition, comparison of the rfb loci of strains lai and fiocruz l1- <dig>  both belong to the same serogroup, icterohaemorrhagiae, revealed only minor gene diversity. hierarchical clustering of the cgh data based on the  <dig> rfb genes further revealed the phylogenetic relationship among different strains . the unrooted  tree revealed that strains lai and fiocruz l1- <dig> were clustered together but showed relatively low correlation to other strains in this study. interestingly, strains l <dig> and h <dig>  were also clustered together. this result implies that the compositions of the rfb locus genes from strains of the same serogroup are likely more similar to each other than those of different serogroups. although strains belonging to different serogroups were also found to fall under the same node, such as strains  <dig> and lin, and strains lin <dig>  lin <dig> and luo; no strains belonging to the same serogroup were separated into two or more different nodes. due to the lack of comprehensive sequence information for the rfb loci of all the strains tested, this result may lie in incapable of identifying rfb genes present in the tested strain but absent from the strain lai-based microarray.

because of the key role of leptospiral lps in pathology, immunity and taxonomy, the continued investigation of lps biosynthetic genes in other serovars, particularly the strain-specific and/or missing regionsof the rfb loci is important. conserved sequences flanking missing cdss identified by the cgh analysis for different serovar strains might serve as appropriate primer candidates for amplifying strain-specific regions, which could eventually be useful for rapid identification and isolation of characteristic genomic segments  corresponding to leptospiral serogroups and serovars.

genes associated with immunity
human vaccines composed of inactivated whole bacterial cell or outer membrane envelope are available in some countries to prevent leptospirosis  <cit> . however various kinds of serovar specificity limited the efficacy of protection against different pathogenic leptospires  <cit> . a major focus of research for the prevention of leptospirosis is to identify proteins conserved among pathogenic leptospires, which may generate cross-protection against strains of various serovars  <cit> . in addition to the complete genomic sequence information for pathogenic bacteria, cgh analysis was useful as one of the approaches based on reverse vaccinology  <cit>  for screening vaccine candidates against leptospirosis.

genes that are highly conserved over a broad range of strains could be useful for the development of a protein-based vaccine capable of protecting hosts against most of the pathogenic serogroups of l. interrogans in china. our results showed that  <dig> putative lipoprotein or outer membrane proteins were not conserved among the strains tested . however, previous report indicated that ompl <dig> and lipl <dig> were highly conserved among the main endemic strains of l. interrogans in china  <cit> . this cgh analysis not only confirmed these results but further identified additional conserved leptospiral protein antigen candidates, such as lipl <dig> and immunoglobulin-like proteins, and they have been shown to elicit protective immunity in animal models  <cit> .

virulence factors
the primary lesion caused by leptospiral infection is damaging to the endothelium of small blood vessels, leading to hemorrhage and localized ischemia in multiple organs  <cit> . potential virulence factors such as hemolysin, protease and ankyrin-like proteins are suggested for pathogenesis of leptospirosis  <cit> . the cgh results showed that most of the potential virulence factors were conserved among all strains. the l. interrogans strain lai microarray included the  <dig> genes coding for hemolysins  <cit> , of which,  <dig>  were conserved among all strains tested. two hemolysin genes  were absent from strain 65- <dig>  ankyrin repeats were found in numerous proteins mediating specific protein-protein interactions  <cit> . genes encoding ankyrin-like proteins were found in bacterial genomes located in close proximity to genes encoding proteins involved in either nutrient acquisition and uptake or tolerance/resistance to antibiotics, starvation or oxidative stress  <cit> . the microarray used for this cgh analysis included the  <dig> ankyrin-like protein encoding genes. these genes were conserved in all strains except la <dig>  which was absent from strain 65- <dig>  the gene encoding collagenase was also conserved in all strains tested.

CONCLUSIONS
l. interrogans serovar lai strain lai whole genome cdss microarray based cgh analysis revealed extensive similarities in gene content among l interrogans strains of different serovars endemic in china. we discovered that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  cdss represented on the microarray were present/conserved in any of the  <dig> given l interrogans strains. only  <dig> cdss were absent when compared to l interrogans strain lai. most of these strain specific genes are focused on  <dig> genomic island-like loci. of which, two gis  had several features as pathogenicity and metabolic islands. both of them contain many divergent genes, which may contribute to differences in disease manifestation. differences in the genes involved in o-antigen synthesis largely focused on the third genomic island-like rfb locus were also identified in strains belonging to different serogroups, which will open new avenues for the development of rapid typing tools by analyzing serovar-specific genes. although strain-specific genes may result from genetic drift, some of them are likely to encode proteins adapted to genetically diverged hosts or factors contributed to different disease outcomes. given the small sample size and lack of clinical information for many of the strains, we cannot correlate these specific genes with particular disease outcomes. however, the strain-specific genes presented by this work will form the basis for further investigation of the pathogenesis of l interrogans and will be useful for data-mining aiming at future development of effective vaccines or diagnostic means.
