BACKGROUND
macrophomina phaseolina, a global devastating necrotrophic fungal pathogen, infects more than  <dig> plant hosts  <cit> . it includes major food crops , pulse crops , fiber crops , and oil crops . despite its wide host range, macrophomina is a monotypic genus  <cit> .

diseases caused by m. phaseolina  are favored with higher temperatures  and low soil moisture  <cit> . it is difficult to control m. phaseolina due to its persistence as sclerotia in the soil and plant debris  <cit> . recently, increased incidence of the pathogen on diverse crop species has been reported worldwide  <cit> , highlighting the importance of this disease to crop production in drought prone regions.

the fungus has a wide geographical distribution, and is especially found in tropical and subtropical countries with arid to semi-arid climates in africa, asia, europe, and north and south america  <cit> . this pathogen can result in severe crop losses. for example, charcoal rot is a serious problem of soybean, which accounted for a total yield loss of $ <dig>  million in the united states during  <dig>  <cit> . in bangladesh, the fiber yield of jute is reduced by 30% due to this pathogen.

m. phaseolina is an anamorphic fungus in the ascomycete family botryosphaeriaceae. the fungus can remain viable for more than 4 years in soil and crop residue as sclerotia   <cit> . the m. phaseolina hyphae initially invade the cortical tissue of jute plants, followed by sclerotia formation, causing stem rot disease . gray-black mycelia and sclerotia are produced  and the infected area exhibits disease symptoms . the conidia are hyaline, aseptate, thin-walled, and elliptical . under favorable conditions, hyphae germinate from the sclerotia and infect the roots of the host plant by penetrating the plant cell wall through mechanical pressure and/or chemical softening  <cit> . the disease progresses from leaf yellowing to wilting and ultimately plant death . 

currently, genetic information on m. phaseolina is scarce with only  <dig> expressed sequence tags  and  <dig> nucleotide sequences in the national center for biotechnology information . here we report the draft genome sequence of highly destructive plant pathogen m. phaseolina to gain insight into the molecular basis of pathogenesis.

RESULTS
genome sequencing and assembly
the genome of m. phaseolina was sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun approach. a total of  <dig>  gb of raw sequence was generated from a combination of  <dig> and illumina platforms . the resulting assembly is  <dig>  mb of which  <dig> % is non-gapped sequence . mapping with newbler gs reference mapper  showed  <dig> % reads and  <dig> % bases mapped to the reference assembly. the draft genome sequence consists of  <dig> scaffolds, with  <dig> super scaffolds covering  <dig> % of the total assembled length . we predicted  <dig>  protein-coding genes and  <dig>  were validated by the transcriptome .

we examined the homology between m. phaseolina and  <dig> other fungal genomes under the classes of saccharomycetes, sordariomycetes, agaricomycetes, and eurotiomycetes. the results revealed that 71% of the genes in the m. phaseolina genome have homologs in other fungal genomes and the remaining 29% are orphan genes . among the orphan genes,  <dig> % are found in the transcriptome.

the comparison of m. phaseolina protein families with other ascomycete fungal species is shown in table  <dig> . the genome contains  <dig> %  secreted proteins as compared to 7-10% in other plant pathogens  <cit> . surprisingly, m. phaseolina has the lowest number of proteases among ascomycete fungal species  <cit>  . on the other hand, the genome is distinct from other fungi by having the highest number of cytochrome p <dig>  glycosidase, and secondary metabolite backbone genes. we predict that this might be one of the main strategies of m. phaseolina to overcome the host plant defense response by using various secondary metabolites.

conserved syntenic and phylogenetic relationship
pairwise comparison revealed that the genome structures of m. phaseolina and fusarium oxysporum, one of the most important phytopathogenic and toxigenic fungi, have large areas of synteny . among the  <dig>  m. phaseolina genes,  <dig>   are shared with f. oxysporum . the large number of shared genes may reflect common strategies for infecting a remarkably broad host range. ninety seven percent of the m. phaseolina genome comprises non-repetitive sequences, and the orthologs shared with the f. oxysporum genome display an average 52% identity. a phylogenetic analysis revealed the evolutionary relationship among fungal taxa and the positioning of m. phaseolina within the pezizomycotina .

global paralog network
of the  <dig>  predicted proteins, we found homologs for  <dig>  proteins in nine fungal genomes. to characterize functional protein families in the m. phaseolina genome, we constructed a database in pathway studio  containing m. phaseolina proteins with functional annotation from the orthologs in nine other fungal genomes, predicted interologs, predicted pathways, and paralog network. the largest paralog families were identified by clustering the paralog network consisting of  <dig>  paralog links representing paralog pairs with sequence homology above 30%. we identified  <dig> paralog families having more than six proteins . the larger paralog families were the cytochrome p <dig> , mfs type membrane transporters , and transposases . the large number of transposons in the m. phaseolina genome suggests that they could be the primary mechanism for mutagenesis and gene duplications, which in turn may promote the ability of m. phaseolina to infect new plant species.

there was also a high number of paralogs for the oxido-reductase class of enzymes which includes dehydrogenases, aldehyde dehydrogenases, choline dehydrogenases, cytochrome p <dig> and aldose reductases. these oxido-reductase enzymes produce and utilize a large variety of secondary metabolites  <cit>  which may trigger m. phaseolina to survive in a wide range of physical environments and facilitate to infect new plant species. the pth <dig> paralog family consists of a large number of g-protein coupled receptors , which contain a cysteine-rich fungal extracellular membrane domain. this may facilitate m. phaseolina to be more virulent.

repetitive dna and transposable elements
wide virulence capabilities of a genome are often associated with transposon-mediated inactivation or deletion of pathogen-associated molecular pattern -encoding genes whose products trigger the plant adaptive immune system  <cit> . the m. phaseolina genome comprises  <dig> % repetitive dna and  <dig> % transposable elements. the transposable elements are classified into  <dig> families . most of them are dna transposases, with particular abundance of the subclasses gypsy , ty1_copia , and dde_ <dig> . line  and hat  are also relatively abundant. transposable elements appear to be tightly clustered in the genome . evidence for repeat-induced point mutation  within the transposable elements was searched using ripcal  <cit> , but this mutational bias was not observed in the m. phaseolina genome . the genome contains more fragmented pseudogenes  than processed pseudogenes  caused by mobile elements, but lacks duplicated pseudogenes. this is consistent with transposons making a greater contribution to genetic instability in m. phaseolina.

carbohydrate degrading enzymes
phytopathogenic fungi secrete a cocktail of hydrolytic enzymes  for degrading the plant cell wall and penetrating into the host tissue  <cit> . the m. phaseolina genome encodes  <dig> putative cazymes including  <dig> glycoside hydrolases ,  <dig> glycosyltransferases ,  <dig> carbohydrate esterases ,  <dig> carbohydrate binding modules , and  <dig> polysaccharide lyases  comprising more than  <dig> distinct families. these enzymes do not appear to be tightly clustered, but are distributed throughout the genome .

the number of ghs possessed by m. phaseolina is higher than the average for plant pathogenic fungi and is nearly four times more abundant than the gts, consistent with the importance of carbohydrate degradation rather than formation. there are  <dig> putative endoglucanases ,  <dig> exocellobiohydrolases , and  <dig> β-glucosidases  for the hydrolysis of cellulose. the cellulolytic activity of m. phaseolina was shown to be significantly higher than that of other fungal species   <cit> , reflecting the pathogenicity potency of this fungus.

the m. phaseolina genome also has the highest number of ces than any other sequenced fungal genome so far , with particular expansion of families ce <dig>  and ce <dig> . thirty two ce <dig> members are found in the m. phaseolina genome, but is absent in eight other species . nine ce <dig> candidate cutinases were found in the genome, suggesting that these enzymes are critical for initial penetration through the plant cuticle. the complement of pectin lyases , pectin hydrolases , and pectin esterases allows m. phaseolina to fully saccharify pectin. other polysaccharide degrading enzymes predicted in the genome include catalytic activities for degrading starch and glycogen, hemicellulose, chitin, and β-glucans.

genes involved in lignin degradation
major components of the lignin depolymerization system in m. phaseolina include laccases, lignin peroxidases, galactose oxidases, and chloroperoxidases, haloperoxidases, and heme peroxidases. m. phaseolina strain ms <dig> indeed demonstrates ligninolytic activity . in comparison to seven other fungal species, m. phaseolina possesses the highest number of laccases . lignin peroxidase has been reported only in phanerochaete chrysosporium thus far  <cit>  and interestingly, this study revealed the second occurrence in m. phaseolina. six extracellular class ii heme peroxidases ,  <dig> chloroperoxidases, and  <dig> haloperoxidases also contribute to the ligninolytic activity. in addition, we found a significant number of gmc oxidoreductases , which includes alcohol oxidases and cellobiose dehydrogenases. these enzymes are known to be directly involved in lignocellulosic degradation  <cit> . 

virulence associated genes
as a wide host ranged pathogenic fungus, m. phaseolina is expected to possess a significant number of pathogen-host interaction genes. we searched the genome using the pathogen-host interaction database   <cit>  and identified  <dig> putative phi genes . these genes play diverse roles in pathogenesis including adhesion, signal transduction, cell wall breakdown, purine biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of the potent mycotoxin patulin. atp-binding cassette  transporters aid in defending the pathogen from host-produced secondary metabolites as well as provide essential nutrients  <cit> . a number of detoxification genes are present, such as those encoding cytochrome p <dig> , cof protein , and superoxide dismutase, cu/zn binding . in addition, several beta-ketoacyl synthases  involved in the biosynthesis of a polyketide antibiotic  <cit>  as well as some tetracycline resistance genes have been identified in m. phaseolina. these data suggest that the m. phaseolina genome encodes a large repertoire of pathogenicity-associated genes which may be involved in the pathogenesis of this organism.

signal transduction
the perception of environmental cues through cell-surface receptors and relaying the information to intracellular signaling pathways is essential for pathogenicity. the pth11-like gpcr is a phi protein shown to regulate magnaporthe grisea appressorium differentiation in response to the plant surface  <cit> . the m. phaseolina genome has  <dig> putative pth11-like gpcrs compared to an average of  <dig> in other pathogenic fungi . the putative pth11-like gpcrs are grouped into seven subfamilies. three g-protein alpha subunits are present to transduce the extracellular signals leading to infection specific development, which is required for pathogenicity  <cit> . the  <dig> protein kinases in m. phaseolina is above the average  found in other ascomycete fungi . since signal transduction is a crucial part of fungal development and the infection process, indeed most of the kinases had orthologs in phi-base . this result indicates that protein kinases in m. phaseolina might play a functional role in pathogen-host interaction.

transport and detoxification of compounds
plant pathogenic fungi use a wide range of strategies to gain access to the carbon sources of their host plants and counter the plant defense response. the m. phaseolina genome encodes  <dig> transporter genes comprising  <dig> families . majority of the transporter genes  were similar to those cataloged in phi-base. a large proportion of transporters belong to the mfs family , but the abc superfamily  and amino acid-polyamine-organocation  family  are also well represented in the genome . m. phaseolina has more amino acid transporters  than other pathogenic fungi , revealing that this fungus might be able to access a wide range of protein degradation products from host sources. the sucrose and galactoside transporter  is required by metarhizium anisopliae for rhizosphere competence but not for virulence  <cit> . the m. phaseolina genome has  <dig> sucrose and galactoside transporters, whereas fusarium graminearum contains  <dig>  suggesting these genes could be generally important for establishing plant-fungus relationships.

we found a relatively large number of genes involved in detoxification . the dehydrogenases , acyl-coa n-acetyltransferases , monooxygenases , and cytochrome p450s  were preferentially expanded in m. phaseolina. p450s play an important role in various hydroxylation and oxidation processes including secondary metabolism as well as the breakdown of toxins and other xenobiotic compounds  <cit> . for example, pisatin demethylase, a p <dig> from the plant pathogenic fungus nectria haematococca, detoxifies a specific class of plant defense compounds  <cit> . the genome was particularly enriched in zinc-containing alcohol dehydrogenases  required for the biosynthesis of mannitol, a crucial factor for stress tolerance and virulence in the animal pathogen cryptococcus neoformans <cit> . the monooxygenases are generally involved in rapid elimination of plant polyphenols , thus reducing the plant defense  <cit> .

secondary metabolic pathways
plant pathogenic fungi produce diverse secondary metabolites that aid in pathogenicity, such as host selective toxins  <cit> . we identified  <dig> putative secondary metabolite genes in the m. phaseolina genome, compared with  <dig> in m. grisea,  <dig> in botrytis cinerea,  <dig> in sclerotinia sclerotiorum, and  <dig> in f. graminearum . there are  <dig> genes predicted to encode polyketide synthases , compared with  <dig> pks genes in m. grisea. an impressive number of non-ribosomal peptide synthetases  are found in m. phaseolina, which catalyze the production of cyclic peptides including numerous toxins. only  <dig> nrps genes and  <dig> hybrid pks-nrps are present in m. grisea, whereas  <dig> nrps and  <dig> pks-nrps genes are in m. phaseolina. virulence of several fungi  is mediated by particular siderophores, a class of secondary metabolites for iron uptake whose synthesis involves a nrps  <cit> . m. phaseolina contains a nrps  which is similar to hts <dig> , the key enzyme responsible for the biosynthesis of the host-selective hc-toxin that confers the specificity of cochliobolus carbonum to maize  <cit> . the nrps-like proteins encoded by contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig>  contig <dig>  and contig <dig> are most similar to ace <dig>  a pks-nrps hybrid that confers avirulence to m. grisea during rice infection  <cit> . 

athe abbreviations are pks, polyketide synthase; nrps, non-ribosomal peptide synthetase; hybrid, hybrid pks-nrps enzyme; dmat, dimethylallyl tryptophan synthase.

phenotypic response in relation to different environmental stimuli
we used phenotype microarray  analysis  to evaluate m. phaseolina against ~ <dig> different carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, nutrient supplement, peptide nitrogen, osmolytes, and ph sources . of particular interest, we found that the adaptability to wide osmotic and ph ranges could be a contributing factor to this organism’s pervasive nature.

pm analysis revealed that m. phaseolina is capable of growing in sodium salt concentrations of 1-8%, with maximal growth at 2-4% . in comparison, 3 % nacl is toxic for saccharomyces cerevisiae but is close to the optimum for growth of the halophilic black yeast hortaea werneckii, one of the most salt-tolerant eukaryotic organisms so far described  <cit> . the efficient utilization of various osmolytes provides clues to m. phaseolina’s osmoadaptation strategy. it was recently shown that salinity increases the disease severity caused by m. phaseolina on phaseolus vulgaris , by enhancing the growth rate of the pathogen as well as weakening the plant due to ion  imbalance  <cit> . this indicates that m. phaseolina could be a greater threat in areas with saline soils.

ph is one of the major environmental factors affecting pathogenicity. the m. phaseolina genome contains  <dig> putative palh and  <dig> pali proteins which are responsible for sensing ambient ph  <cit> . moreover, there are several ph-regulated proteins including  <dig> acid phosphatases,  <dig> α-l-arabinofuranosidases, and  <dig> alkaline phosphatases. the presence of acid and alkaline phosphatases indicates that m. phaseolina has an extraordinary capability to neutralize both acidic and alkaline environments for its growth. this is clearly evident from our pm analysis. the results revealed that m. phaseolina can grow in ph ranging from strongly acidic to alkaline , with maximum growth between ph  <dig> to  <dig> . therefore, m. phaseolina has a robust ph sensing system which enables it to adapt to adverse conditions.

pathogenesis of m. phaseolina
the array of metabolic genes within the m. phaseolina genome reflects its pathogenic lifestyle .

the production and dispersal of conidia is important for fungal survival and infection of new hosts. hyperosmotic stress is one of the environmental stimuli that often trigger conidiation  <cit> . the m. phaseolina genome encodes mph_ <dig>  a homolog of the map kinase osm <dig>  which regulates the osmotic stress response  along with mph_ <dig> and mph_ <dig> . in m. grisea, deletion of osm <dig> has pleiotropic effects including osmotic sensitivity, reduced conidiation, and overproduction of appressoria  <cit> . 

adhesion of fungal propagules to the plant surface is the prerequisite to establish disease. we identified  <dig> homologs of cellulose-binding elicitor lectin , a cell surface glycoprotein that plays a role in adhesion to host wall components  <cit> , as well as a class ii hydrophobic protein which mediates contact and communication between the fungus and its environment  <cit> . m. phaseolina also has three transglutaminase-like proteins containing a 13-amino acid motif  that is able to stimulate the plant defense response. presence of these cell surface proteins suggests that m. phaseolina produces pamps, which can be efficiently perceived by a wide range of plant species. activation of the plant immune system results in the synthesis of antifungal peptides, inhibitors of cell wall degrading enzymes, and phytoalexins. at the same time, the fungus responds to surface inductive cues via a camp-dependent pathway in order to initiate the infection process and combat the plant defense response .

invasion begins with the emergence of a germ tube from the conidium, followed by appressorium formation. the developing appressorium swells as the cytoskeleton and golgi vesicles accumulate in the tip. in bean rust pathogen uromyces appendiculatus, the cytoskeleton and vesicles in the apex of the hypha are reorganized along the cell wall within 4 minutes of signal perception  <cit> . enzymes for fungal cell wall synthesis  as well as cell wall degradation  are contained within different vesicles. m. phaseolina also synthesizes phytosphingosine and phytoceramide to protect the cell membrane from mechanical damage during penetration of the host cell. high turgor pressure is generated within the appressorium, allowing the penetration peg to break through the plant epidermis. secretion of a variety of cell wall degrading enzymes and other toxins aid in the invasion of the host. these hyphae penetrate epidermal walls directly and subsequently colonize the tissue by intra- and intercellular growth .

regulation of these invasion processes involves both camp-dependent and map kinase pathways . surface recognition and appressoria initiation is dependent on the adenylate cyclase mac <dig> . early research revealed that deletion of the mac <dig> gene blocked appressorium formation in m. grisea <cit> . the catalytic subunit of camp-dependent protein kinase a  is also required for appressoria formation and penetration. furthermore, the m. phaseolina genome contains heterotrimeric g-proteins , which could also contribute to the signaling pathways for pathogenesis. the later stage of plant penetration is regulated by the map kinase pmk <dig> . a pmk <dig> mutant of m. grisea is unable to make appressoria in rice plants and is non-pathogenic. therefore, pmk <dig> is specifically involved in the regulation of appressorium formation in response to surface signals and is also necessary for invasive growth  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
m. phaseolina is a soil-borne plant pathogenic fungus that infects major food, fiber, and oil crops, but it is also an opportunistic pathogen of humans  <cit> . therefore, an understanding of the genetic basis underlying pathogenicity is crucial for controlling this pathogen.

whole genome analysis showed that m. phaseolina is distinct from those of other known phytopathogenic fungi. we found 12% of the genes encoded by the genome have significant similarities with genes involved in pathogen-host interactions. m. phaseolina possesses a large repertoire of hydrolytic enzymes for degrading all major components of the plant cell wall and cuticle, including cellulose, hemicellulose, pectin, lignin, and cutin. the overall number of cazymes is particularly high, primarily due to the abundance of ghs. comparison with genomes of other phytopathogenic fungi reveals a distinct set of ces in m. phaseolina, with significant expansion of families ce <dig> and ce <dig>  ces are considered as the first line of attack during host invasion and therefore play a key role in pathogenesis  <cit> . extensive genetic diversity was also observed within complex gene families encoding peroxidases, oxidases, and cytochrome p450s. interestingly, the genome has a considerable number of lignin peroxidases, extracellular class ii heme peroxidases, chloroperoxidases, and haloperoxidases compared with lignocellulose degrading fungus p. chrysosporium. the vast array of genes enables m. phaseolina to tackle nearly any type of cell wall composition it encounters, resulting in highly efficient penetration of different hosts and tissues.

we have identified differences in gene content among m. phaseolina and other plant pathogenic fungi. this is the first analysis of the genome of a plant pathogenic fungus that contains a large number of enzymes for the degradation of cell wall polysaccharides and lignocellulose. the m. phaseolina genome laid the foundation to elucidate its specialized mechanism to infect more than  <dig> plant hosts. furthermore, it would decipher in-depth understanding of pathogenesis to resistance strategies.
