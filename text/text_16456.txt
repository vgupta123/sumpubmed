BACKGROUND
lipid droplets are defined as a class of organelles for storing neutral fat such as triacylglycerol  and cholesterol ester  in eukaryotes  <cit> . lipid droplets are spherical structures delimited by a phospholipid monolayer  <cit>  that is coated by various proteins including adipophilin, perilipin, and adipose triglyceride lipase   <cit> . the size and content of lipid droplets can be dynamically regulated by both metabolic pathways and coat proteins. studies of how lipid droplets are regulated will undoubtedly yield key insights into the understanding of obesity, diabetes, and other metabolic diseases  <cit> .

the nematode c. elegans has emerged as an important model to study fat metabolism. in c. elegans, the majority of fat is stored in gut epithelial cells. however, the organelle nature and biophysical properties of fat storage structures are not fully defined. the putative fat storage structures have been given different names such as gut granules or lysosome-related organelles   <cit> , vesicles distinct from lysosome-related organelles  <cit> , and lipid droplets  <cit> . these names reflect the different approaches to and current insufficient understanding of c. elegans fat storage structures. vital labelling with nile red or a bodipy fatty acid analog  was introduced as a proxy for qualitative and quantitative measurement of fat in c. elegans  <cit> . vital nile red and vital bodipy co-label a population of structures in gut epithelial cells, except that bodipy but not nile red weakly labels extra structures in gut epithelial cells and strongly labels structures in hypodermal cells  <cit> . because vital staining is conducive to screening and live imaging, it has been widely used to screen for fat storage mutants and to measure fat levels in c. elegans  <cit> . however, vital nile red-labelled structures were recently shown to be lros in the study of a class of glo mutants  <cit> . in the glo mutants, nile red staining and lros were lost. however, quantitative tag measurement by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry  revealed that fat levels were unaltered  <cit> . moreover, a recent study also suggested that nile red-labelled structures and the majority of bodipy-labelled structures were lros  <cit> . this recent study and another study  <cit>  demonstrated that vital nile red and vital bodipy staining intensities did not necessarily correlate with fat levels measured by gc-ms in mutants previously studied. instead, post-fix oil-red-o  <cit>  and post-fix nile red  <cit>  staining intensities correlated more closely with biochemically verified fat levels. the underlying principles of the two recent staining approaches are unknown. but they both relied on fixation of animals.

in a previous report, we showed lipid droplet expansion in a class of peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation mutants: maoc- <dig>  dhs- <dig>  and daf- <dig>  <cit> . maoc-1/hydratase, dhs-28/dehydrogenase, and daf-22/thiolase carry out three successive reactions in the peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation pathway. here, we report that 1) wild-type c. elegans has lipid droplets that display the same fluorescence, density, and ultrastructural properties as enlarged lipid droplets in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants. 2) lipid droplets in wild-type animals are vital-labelled weakly by bodipy but not by nile red, while lros are vital-labelled strongly by both. 3) lipid droplets in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants can be vital-labelled by nile red. 4) nile red-labelled lipid droplets can be distinguished from lros by a distinct fluorescence emission spectrum. 5) the post-fix nile red staining approach labels lipid droplets solely. these results demonstrate the complexity of lipophilic dye trafficking in gut epithelial cells and should lay down a foundation for future studies of lipid droplets in c. elegans.

RESULTS
both lros and lipid droplets can be vital-labelled by bodipy fatty acid analogs
to investigate whether vital staining by nile red or bodipy could label both lros and lipid droplets, we grew wild-type and glo- <dig> animals on op <dig> e. coli diet supplemented with nile red or bodipy. glo- <dig> encodes a putative guanine nucleotide exchange factor  for the glo- <dig> rab gtpase. glo- <dig> and glo- <dig> mutants lacked lros  <cit> . consistent with a previous report  <cit> , there was no detectable nile red-labelled structure in glo- <dig> mutants . using the same imaging parameters, no autofluorescence was detected in either wild-type or glo- <dig> animals that were not vital-stained with nile red . these results support the idea that nile red labels lros only. in contrast, we observed in gut epithelial cells of wild-type animals two populations of bodipy-labelled structures, one with high fluorescence intensity and the other with lower fluorescence intensity . in glo- <dig> mutants, the low-intensity population remained , while the high-intensity population  and lro-specific autofluorescence  <cit>  were lost . these results suggest that the high-intensity bodipy structures are lros while the low-intensity bodipy structures are putative fat storage structures.

to investigate whether the high-intensity bodipy structures are lros, we grew wild-type animals bearing a transgenic marker for lros  on op <dig> diet supplemented with a red bodipy fatty acid analog, bodipy558/568-c <dig>  indeed, glo-1::gfp encircled high-intensity red bodipy structures . this is consistent with a previous finding that the high-intensity green bodipy signal co-localizes with lysotracker, a marker for lros  <cit> . however, red bodipy also labelled glo-1::gfp-negative structures, albeit with lower fluorescence intensity . in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants, enlarged lipid droplets which are glo-1::gfp-negative, can be labelled by bodipy  <cit> . thus, the glo-1::gfp-negative structures with low bodipy intensity in wild-type animals may also be genuine fat storage structures, i.e., putative lipid droplets.

to confirm that bona fide neutral fat storage structures in live wild-type animals can be labelled by bodipy, we adopted and modified previous differential centrifugation approaches  <cit>  to partially isolate lipid droplets from dhs- <dig> and wild-type animals that were vital-labelled by bodipy. this approach exploits the fact that lipid droplets have a lower density than water and most other intracellular organelles. indeed, enlarged and small lipid droplets isolated from dhs- <dig> mutants were shown to be labelled by green bodipy . also, small putative lipid droplets isolated from wild-type animals were shown to be labelled by green bodipy, albeit with low intensity . similarly, enlarged lipid droplets isolated from dhs- <dig> were labelled by red bodipy, and small putative lipid droplets isolated from wild-type animals were labelled by red bodipy with low intensity . furthermore, we prepared lipid droplet fraction and cytoplasmic fraction from dhs- <dig> mutant animals bearing the glo-1::gfp transgene . western blot experiments showed that the lipid droplet fraction had no detectable glo-1::gfp protein, which was found predominantly in the cytoplasm fraction . this result demonstrated that our biochemical approach could yield lipid droplet fractions devoid of lros.

in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants, lipid droplets can be vital-labelled by nile red and be distinguished from lros by a distinct fluorescence spectrum
a previous report  <cit>  and our unpublished observations  demonstrated that nile red could vital-label enlarged lipid droplets and other small spherical structures in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants. we have shown that although the loss of glo- <dig> function leads to a loss of lros, it did not prevent the formation of enlarged lipid droplets in mutants with defective peroxisomes  <cit> . interestingly, in daf-22; glo- <dig> double mutants, enlarged lipid droplets and small putative lipid droplets could be vital-labelled by nile red  as well as by bodipy . it further supports the notion that, in contrast to lipid droplets in wild-type animals, lipid droplets in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants can be vital-labelled by nile red.

here, we sought to compare fluorescence properties of nile red-labelled lros in wild-type animals and nile red-labelled lipid droplets and lros in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants. we scanned nile red emission spectra in wild-type and dhs- <dig> animals. in wild-type animals, all nile red-positive structures, i.e., lros, displayed the same emission spectrum that peaked at  <dig> nm . we classified these structures as "spec-1". in contrast, in dhs- <dig> mutants, there were structures with a different spectrum that peaked at  <dig> nm and shouldered at  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm in addition to spec-1s . we classified these structures as "spec-2". in wild-type and dhs- <dig> mutant animals, the spec-1s were mostly smaller than  <dig> μm in diameter and encircled by the lro marker glo-1::gfp . in dhs- <dig> mutant animals, the spec-2s were rather heterogeneous in size, ranging from below  <dig> μm to  <dig> μm in diameter . importantly, all enlarged lipid droplets were spec-2s . consistent with the notion that glo- <dig> encodes a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for glo- <dig>  glo-1::gfp marking was lost in glo- <dig> mutants . in daf-22;glo- <dig> double mutants, all spec-1s were lost, while spec-2s, i.e., enlarged lipid droplets and small putative lipid droplets, remained .

we next sought to obtain vital nile red-stained subcellular structures using our differential centrifugation procedure. to this end, we grew dhs- <dig> mutants on 10-cm ngm/op <dig> plates that were overlaid with nile red. we then prepared lipid droplet fractions from ~ <dig>  dhs- <dig> animals harvested from 10-cm ngm/op50/nile red plates, and pelleted cytoplasmic membranous organelles that included lros. as shown in additional file  <dig>  isolated membrane pellets displayed spec- <dig> spectrum similar to spec- <dig> in intact dhs- <dig> animals; and isolated lipid droplets displayed spec- <dig> spectrum similar to spec- <dig> in intact dhs- <dig> animals. for reasons currently unknown, we noted that dhs- <dig> animals grown and stained on 10-cm ngm/op50/nile red plates displayed more prominent  <dig> nm and  <dig> nm peaks of spec-2s than their counterparts that were grown and stained on 6-cm ngm/ op50/nile red plates .

we also probed whether red bodipy had different fluorescence emission spectra when labelling lros vs. lipid droplets. in dhs- <dig> mutant animals bearing glo-1::gfp marker, both gfp-encircled lros and non-gfp-encircled large lipid droplets displayed the same emission spectrum peaked at  <dig> nm and shouldered at 620- <dig> nm . thus, bodipy labelling did not distinguish lipid droplets from lros as nile red labelling did.

we interpret these results as indicating that in wild-type c. elegans, lysosome related organelles  are vital-labelled by both bodipy and nile red with high intensity. on the other hand, lipid droplets, the fat storage structures, can be vital-labelled by bodipy with low intensity but not by nile red. under special conditions such as peroxisomal β-oxidation dysfunction, lipid droplets can be labelled by nile red and be distinguished from lros by a distinct fluorescence emission spectrum. since in any situation, both bodipy and nile red stain lros strongly, fluorescence intensities of the two vital lipophilic dyes should be used with great caution as surrogates of intracellular fat levels.

post-fix nile red staining labels lipid droplets solely
recently, it was found that the intensities of post-fix nile red or oil-red-o staining correlated more closely with quantitative tag measurements by gc-ms than the intensities of vital nile red or bodipy staining  <cit> . however, the underlying principle of the post-fix staining as a better proxy of fat level is not clear. the post-fix approach involves permeating cell membrane and intracellular membrane with isopropanol and freeze-fracture. this treatment presumably allows direct penetration of the two dyes.

we hypothesized that the invasive manner in which nile red and oil-red-o were delivered allowed targeting of these dyes to lipid droplets that bypassed lros. to test this hypothesis, we stained fixed wild-type and glo- <dig> animals with nile red. consistent with a previous report  <cit> , post-fix nile red staining labelled spherical structures in both wild-type and glo- <dig> animals , which were not otherwise vital-labelled by nile red in glo- <dig> mutants . more interestingly, spectral analyses of emission spectra of nile red in wild-type and glo- <dig> animals revealed that all labelled structures displayed the same spec- <dig> property as that of lipid droplets in peroxisome mutants . moreover, post-fix nile red staining did not label any spec- <dig> structures, i.e., lros , which were otherwise the only structures labelled by nile red in live wild-type animals .

lipid droplets are ubiquitous fat storage organelles with a phospholipid monolayer membrane in c. elegans
the above imaging and biochemical isolation experiments indicate that fat storage structures in wild-type and glo- <dig> animals possess the same properties as enlarged lipid droplets in mutants defective in peroxisomal function. next, we sought to confirm that they also shared the same properties at the ultrastructural level, similar to mammalian lipid droplets that are characterized as electron-translucent structures with a phospholipid monolayer membrane  <cit> .

close inspection of electron-translucent structures in wild-type animals revealed that they were indeed similar to enlarged lipid droplets in daf- <dig> mutant animals  <cit> . these structures, with diameters normally smaller than  <dig> μm, possessed a phospholipid monolayer membrane , the hallmark of lipid droplets. in glo- <dig> mutants, lipid droplets were not eliminated . in daf-22;glo- <dig> double mutants, neither small nor large lipid droplets were eliminated . these results demonstrate that lipid droplets are universal fat storage structures in c. elegans and that lipid droplets are fundamentally distinct from lros in their structural properties and their sensitivity to different genetic regulatory mechanisms.

discussion
the present study serves two purposes in the research of c. elegans fat storage. the first is to ascertain the organelle nature of fat storage structures. the second is to carefully compare the different vital and post-fix staining methods that aimed to label fat storage structures.

this work is based on our previous study in which we demonstrated that the enlarged spherical structures found in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants were lipid droplets  <cit> . it was unclear at that time whether lipid droplets formed only when peroxisomal function was attenuated in c. elegans. in this paper, we provided three lines of evidence, namely, electron microscopy, biochemical isolation, vital and post-fix lipophilic dye staining and fluorescence imaging, to demonstrate that lipid droplets are ubiquitous fat storage organelles in c. elegans. first, we showed that in wild-type c. elegans, at an ultrastructural level, lipid droplets were uniformly electron-translucent structures delimited by a phospholipid monolayer membrane. this ultrastructural characteristic was previously documented for large lipid droplets in peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants in c. elegans  <cit> , lipid droplets in the budding yeast  <cit> , and lipid droplets in mammalian cells  <cit> . such characteristic is regarded as a hallmark of lipid droplets  <cit> . second, since lipid droplets are loaded with neutral fat such as tag and ce, their density is much lower than water and most other intracellular organelles. this physical property allows density centrifugation-based isolation of lipid droplets from yeast and mammalian cells  <cit> . we developed a similar approach and isolated lipid droplets from wild-type and peroxisomal β-oxidation mutant c. elegans. and we found that the isolated lipid droplets were labelled by bodipy. third, we confirmed previous findings that lros were the major organelles labelled by bodipy and nile red in live animals. nevertheless, we found that nile red labelled lipid droplets in live peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants, and its fluorescence emission spectrum was distinct from that of nile red in lros. nile red emission spectrum shift was previously documented as neutral fat-dependent  <cit> . the emission spectrum shift was also found to be specific to lipid droplets in mammalian macrophages  <cit> .

our identification of lipid droplets as the fat storage organelles in c. elegans has important implications for the principles and validity of previous fat staining methods. as shown in this study and several previous studies, nile red and bodipy label lros in live wild-type c. elegans  <cit> . in addition, we showed that bodipy but not nile red can label lipid droplets in wild-type c. elegans. since the absence of lros in glo mutants does not alter tag levels  <cit> , lros are unlikely to be the sites of fat storage. thus, fluorescence intensities of bodipy or nile red vital staining cannot be used as a sole indicator of fat levels. this view agrees with those of two previous reports  <cit> . why does bodipy label both lros and lipid droplets and why does nile red label only lros in wild-type c. elegans? vital dyes are applied onto the e. coli lawn and ingested by c. elegans into the gut lumen. it is plausible that the vital dyes are endocytosed, recycled, and delivered to lysosomes for degradation in gut epithelial cells  <cit> . bodipy is different from nile red in that it is conjugated to a fatty acid moiety. in mammalian cells, fatty acids and fatty acid moieties are released from lysosomes and targeted to lipid droplets  <cit> . it appears that a similar process happens for bodipy fatty acid analogs but not for nile red in wild-type c. elegans . why does nile red as well as bodipy label lipid droplets besides lros when peroxisomal β-oxidation is impaired? the exact mechanism is currently unknown. the peroxisomal β-oxidation pathway and endolysosomal pathway genetically interact to affect larval development and body length . similar genetic interactions may underlie the trafficking of nile red from endosomes and/or lysosomes to lipid droplets . physical contact between peroxisomes and lipid droplets may also be involved  <cit> . why do the two post-fix methods reveal fat levels more closely  <cit> ? the post-fix labelling methods involve permeating cell membrane and intracellular membrane invasively by isopropanol and/or freeze/thaw treatments  <cit> . the delivery of nile red and oil-red-o to lipid droplets thus bypasses the endolysosomal pathway and lros. the post-fix staining procedure may also compromise the integrity of lros and make them un-stainable.

the present study should allow re-interpretation of previous studies in c. elegans fat research and guide the design of future qualitative and quantitative studies of lipid droplets. for example, we showed that bodipy could label lipid droplets with low intensity in live wild-type animals while nile red and bodipy could label both large and small lipid droplets in live peroxisomal β-oxidation mutant animals. our results highlight the complexity of intracellular trafficking of lipophilic dyes which should be examined carefully. on one hand, it suggests that mutants showing changes in vital nile red and bodipy fluorescence intensity may actually have alterations in lysosome/lro proliferation or function. on the other hand, it lends support to the use of these two vital dyes for lipid droplet labelling in peroxisomal mutant animals and animals of other yet unexplored genetic backgrounds, provided that independent methods are available to distinguish lipid droplets from lros. because of the dual labelling by bodipy in our peroxisomal β-oxidation mutants, we previously opted for gc-ms to gauge fat levels and we measured volumes instead of fluorescence intensities to study lipid droplets larger than  <dig> μm in diameter  <cit> . the spectral imaging of nile red and the post-fix nile red staining should now allow measurement of volumes of lipid droplets of all sizes. we also anticipate that, before their acceptance as alternative live imaging techniques for fat levels in c. elegans, label-free imaging approaches based on raman scattering  <cit>  should be subjected to rigorous analyses using a combination of genetic manipulation of lipid droplets and lros, biochemical isolation, spectral analysis, electron microscopy, and lipid analytical chemistry.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have ascertained lipid droplets as the ubiquitous fat storage organelles in c. elegans. our results demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of different dye labelling methodologies for lipid droplets in c. elegans, which will aid future experimental design in this powerful genetic system.
