BACKGROUND
alzheimer’s disease  is characterized by histopathological changes, designated as senile plaques and fibrillary deposits, which ultimately lead to the death of neuronal cells in particular in the cerebral cortex of the brain  <cit> . the familial form of ad is rare, affecting less than five percent of ad patients and has been associated with mutations of presenilin  <dig> , presenilin  <dig>  and amyloid precursor protein   <cit> . these mutations result in incorrect cleavage of the protein, producing a deposited protein of amyloid-β  that is more likely to form plaques  <cit> . little is known about the molecular basis of multifactorial sporadic ad. in post-mortem examination of patients with ad, massive accumulation of two types of amyloid fibril senile plaques  and hyperphosphorylated tau forming paired helical filaments could be detected  <cit> . both types of amyloid fibrils are mainly created enzymatically by β- and γ-secretase activity from the app  <cit> .

the most widely accepted theory for the onset of sporadic ad is the accumulation of extracellular aβ <dig> in an aggregated state in the brain, subsequently leading to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles  containing hyperphosphorylated tau proteins and consequently to its inactivation, thus leading to inhibition of binding to the spindle apparatus and hence disrupted axonal transport  <cit> . the major modification of tau is its phosphorylation. its hyperphosphorylation has been shown to be the critical step in the formation of nfts  <cit> . one of the kinases that phosphorylates tau in-vivo is glycogen synthase kinase-3β , which is widely expressed in all tissues with elevated expression in developing brains  <cit> . unlike many other kinases, gsk3b is believed to be permanently active in resting cells and in neurons without extracellular stimulation and can be inactivated by ser <dig> phosphorylation  <cit> .

moreover, the ubiquitin-proteasome system  has been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of ad  <cit> .

the ups consists of the 26s proteasome and the small protein ubiquitin, a post-translational modification, and is operative in all eukaryotes for intracellular protein homeostasis and quality  <cit> . the alternative form of the constitutive proteasome is the immunoproteasome complex  <cit> . it was demonstrated in in-vitro experiments that the accumulation of aβ peptide in app/psen <dig> mutant neuronal cell culture leads to the inhibition of the proteasome as well as the de-ubiquitinating enzymes   <cit> . despite increasing knowledge on ad-associated pathology, the molecular mechanisms underlying the cause of sporadic and familial ad are still not completely understood. this limitation is primarily due to limited access and availability of viable neuronal cells from ad patients because of ethical and practical reasons. human induced pluripotent stem  cells enables the generation of clinically relevant neuronal cells in-vitro. patient-derived skin cells are an easily accessible source for reprogramming and the obtained neuronal cells can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of neuronal disorders, including parkinson disease and alzheimer’s disease  <cit> .

in our study, we reprogrammed dermal fibroblasts obtained from an 82-year-old female patient diagnosed with late-stage ad to ipscs in one reprogramming experiment. the two derived ipsc lines showed pluripotency-associated properties similar to human embryonic stem cells  and they could be successfully differentiated into neuronal cells in-vitro. the differentiated neuronal cells seemed to reflect the sporadic ad phenotype in the brain of the patient, including the expression of p-tau proteins, the up-regulation of gsk3b protein and its phosphorylation in contrast to the parental dermal fibroblast cells. in addition, numerous ad-related genes were found to be down-regulated, as revealed by microarray-based gene expression analysis of one neuronal differentiation experiment per ad-ips cell line. most notably these genes could be allocated to brain regions affected by alzheimer’s disease.

we demonstrated a down-regulation of p-tau proteins in ad neuronal cells with an inhibitor of γ-secretase. in addition, neuronal cells differentiated from the patient ipscs showed an up-regulation of a number of neuronal and biological processes, which include development of the nervous system, neurogenesis, wnt signaling pathway, the lysosome, glutathion metabolism as well as the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. furthermore, the down-regulation of ad-related genes enabled us to successfully construct a protein association network using the string database reflecting the presence of ad-related disease mechanisms in our ipscs model. finally, we could show that gene regulation of the constitutive as well as of the inducible subunits of the proteasome complex is affected in ipsc-derived neurons from the ad patient compared to the healthy subject. further investigations are needed to better understand the molecular basis of the onset and progression of alzheimer’s disease. elucidating the molecular mechanism of sporadic ad by modeling it via ipsc technology and protein association networks could provide valuable information needed to uncover appropriate strategies against the early onset of the disease.

RESULTS
generation and characterization of sporadic ad-ipscs
dermal fibroblasts were isolated from an 82-year-old woman diagnosed with final stage ad. the cell line was named nfh- <dig>  and lack of ad-related mutations, such as app, psen <dig> and psen <dig>  <cit> , was confirmed by direct sequencing analysis . hla haplotype analysis in the ad donor did not reveal any association of hla alleles to morbus alzheimer. the hla-alleles hla-a*01: <dig> *03:01; b* <dig> * <dig>  c*04: <dig> *07: <dig>  drb1*03: <dig> *11: <dig> were found in nfh- <dig>  however, the alzheimer-related hla-alleles hla-a* <dig>  hla-b* <dig> and hla-c*07: <dig> could not be detected.

ad-ipscs were generated by retroviral transduction using the classical yamanaka cocktail  <cit> , which includes the four transcription factors oct <dig>  klf <dig>  sox <dig>  and c-myc, as demonstrated previously  <cit> . in a single reprogramming experiment several colonies exhibiting hesc-like morphologies were identified and manually picked for expansion and characterization. two ipsc lines, ad-ips <dig> and ad-ips26b, were successfully established from this reprogramming experiment and characterized with respect to pluripotency-associated properties. both lines exhibited hesc-like morphologies , telomerase activity , alkaline phosphatase  activity , expression of pluripotency-associated markers nanog, ssea <dig>  tra-1- <dig>  and tra-1- <dig> , expression of pluripotency-associated genes such as nanog, pou5f <dig>  sox <dig>  lin <dig>  tdgf <dig>  dppa <dig>  fgf <dig>  gdf <dig>  lefty <dig>  lefty <dig>  and the genetic fingerprinting pattern of the parental nfh- <dig> fibroblasts .figure  <dig>

ad-ipscs express key pluripotency-associated proteins. two ad-ipsc lines were successfully generated with one reprogramming experiment: ad-ips <dig>  and ad-ips26b . both lines exhibited hesc-like morphologies, were positive for pluripotency-associated marker proteins, such as tra-1- <dig>  tra-1- <dig>  ssea <dig>  and nanog, and were negative for the differentiation-specific marker ssea <dig>  scale bar, 100 μm.



finally, the transcriptomes of the ad-ipsc lines are similar to hescs  and to ips lines previously generated from control nfh- <dig> fibroblasts  <cit>  .

the ability to differentiate into almost all tissue types as a hallmark of human pluripotent stem cells was analyzed employing embryoid bodies  based differentiation in-vitro and teratoma formation in-vivo. the ad-ipsc lines were able to differentiate in-vitro into all three embryonic germ layers, as detected by the expression of marker proteins specific for ectoderm , for mesoderm  and t/brachyury), and endoderm  and sox17) .

finally, both ad-ipsc lines successfully generated teratomas . for ad-ips <dig>  the presence of known endoderm-associated structures appeared unclear. however, this must not necessarily imply an impairment of this line towards endoderm differentiation in-vivo, since the teratoma assay itself is not standardized  <cit> . moreover, in the in-vitro differentiated cells from ad-ips <dig>  sox <dig> and afp, both protein markers representative of endoderm, could be detected. thus, we consider ad-ips <dig> to be pluripotent.

chromosomal analysis of ad-ips <dig> revealed the loss of a gonosome, probably the x chromosome, because during mitosis they revealed a normal female karyotype. this is in agreement with our previous study showing that ipsc lines generated from old donors are more likely to contain chromosomal aberrations  <cit> . in nine mitoses, a very small supernumerary marker chromosome  was found besides the monosomy x . it is unlikely that the presence of a small supernumaray maker chromosome has an effect on ad-ips <dig> as ssmcs are a common phenomenon in human. the karyotypes of the second ipsc line ad-ips26b and the parental cells nfh- <dig> were normal .

generation of neuronal cells from ad-ipscs 
we derived neuronal cells from ad-ipscs in one experiment to address the potential of these to reflect neuropathological features found in neuronal cells of sporadic ad patients. as a control, neuronal cells were derived from the female hesc line h <dig> in one differentiation experiment. the neuronal cells were generated following a recently published protocol, which requires the exposure to tgf-β receptor  and mek1/ <dig>  inhibitors  <cit> . ad-ipsc lines  and h <dig> were successfully differentiated into neuronal cells. the efficiency of differentiation varied, as ad-ips <dig> showed more pronounced neuronal differentiation than ad-ips26b. all induced neuronal cells were positive for neuronal cell markers pax <dig>  nestin, and b-tubulin iii as shown in figure  <dig>  most of the neuronal marker genes in the heatmap shown in figure 4a are expressed in a similar manner in ad-ipsc neurons and h <dig> neurons, hence confirming a neuronal differentiation of comparable quality across all used pluripotent cell lines.figure  <dig>

expression of neuronal marker genes in ad-ips neurons and h <dig> neurons
the heatmap in figure 4a shows the expression pattern of pre-synaptic and post-synaptic genes as well as markers of distinct subtypes of neural progenitors and mature neuronal cell types in ad-ips neurons and h <dig> neurons of one differentiation experiment conducted. neuronal markers fabp <dig>  hes <dig>  sox <dig>  prom <dig> and ascl <dig> are expressed in ad-ips <dig> and ad-ips26b neurons, however, fabp <dig> was not detected in h <dig> neurons. galc, a marker of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells is expressed in all samples but lower in ad-ips26b and h <dig> neurons. map <dig>  a marker of neuronal dendrites is expressed in ad-ips <dig> neurons but not in neuronal cells of ad-ips26b and h <dig>  moreover, markers of retinal ganglion cells , dopaminergic neurons  and glutamatergic neurons  are expressed in ad-ips <dig> neurons . in addition, neural genes such as neun , gfap and gad <dig>  gad <dig>  on the one hand and specific ad-related neuronal genes such as calbindin <dig> and  <dig>  as well as sst  on the other were analyzed. srif-positive interneurons are inhibitory neurons which express gad <dig> and/or gad <dig> as well as calb <dig>  <cit>  and are the most affected subtypes of neurons in ad  <cit> . to confirm the array-derived heatmap data we analyzed relative gene expression by real-time pcr  using the samples of the same neuronal differentiation experiment which were hybridized for transcriptome analysis. by matching the gene expression to adult brain rna, again the h9-derived neuronal cells did not express subtype-specific neuronal genes. the astrocyte-specific gene gfap was barely detected in all neural cells compared to the mrna level of the adult and ad brain . the neuronal cells from ad-ips <dig> and ad-ips26b were positive for synapsin i, vglut <dig>  and gad <dig> and have the same transcript level as the ad brain for calb <dig> and gad <dig> .

proof-of-principle drug discovery using sporadic ad-ipsc derived neuronal cells
in addition to gene expression based analysis of alzheimer-related genes we evaluated the possible medical relevance of our neuronal cell model in terms of drug discovery and selection of an appropriate therapy for sporadic ad. for this purpose, we subjected the induced neuronal cells to treatment with the γ-secretase-inhibitor compound e . the experiment was carried out once. two distinct concentrations were employed: low  <dig> nm and high  <dig> nm. after one week of treatment, cells were lysed directly and the protein expression levels of p-tau, tau, p-gsk3b and gsk3b were investigated isolating samples from one well of one inhibitor treatment experiment conducted. neuronal cells derived from both ad-ipsc lines  exhibited the expression of tau and p-tau, which were undetectable in the parental fibroblasts  . the results were confirmed using two antibodies, one recognizing only p-tau and the other binding to both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of tau . drug treatment did not result in any reduction of p-tau in ad-ips <dig> derived neuronal cells. on the other hand, we observed a significant reduction of p-tau and tau expression in neuronal cells differentiated from ad-ips26b compared to untreated cells following high doses of ce . the expression of both p-gsk3b and gsk3b was significantly higher in neuronal cells compared to parental fibroblasts nfh- <dig> . however, no evident change in their expression could be identified following ce treatment. neuronal cells were identified based on the expression of nestin and b-tubulin iii, however, expression was also detected in their parental fibroblast cells, thus confirming previous observations in fibroblasts  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
treatment of ad neuronal cells with the γ-secretase-inhibitor compound e . western blot analysis was used to monitor the expression of phosphorylated tau , non-phosphorylated tau, gsk3α/β and phosphorylated gsk3β in ad-ips <dig> neurons  and ad-ips26b neurons . the samples were derived from one well of a single neuronal differentiation. the parental fibroblast cells  were included as control in addition to the positive control  for p-tau represented by lysate from neuroblastoma. β-actin and gapdh and coomassie blue staining were used to confirm similar protein loading across samples.



differential gene expression associated with alzheimer-related pathways and biological processes in ad-ipsc neurons compared to h <dig> neurons
using microarray based gene expression analysis we looked at the changes in the biological processes within the ad-ips neuronal cells compared to h <dig> neurons as control. the hybridized samples were isolated from one neuronal differentiation experiment. processes related to wnt signaling pathway and the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism, in the case of ad-ips <dig> neurons as well as the lysosome pathway and glutathion metabolism in the case of ad-ips26b appeared to be up-regulated compared to h <dig> neurons. pathways related to alzheimer’s disease, huntington’s disease, parkinson’s disease and the proteasome were down-regulated in both ad-ips neurons compared to h <dig> neurons . ad-ips <dig> and ad-ips26b neurons showed up-regulated gene expression for biological processes such as neuronal fate commitment, neuron maturation, response to oxygen radical and/or response to reactive oxygen species . in contrast to that, the ups, apoptosis, and oxidative phosphorylation emerged as down-regulated biological processes . overall, these data suggest that ad neuronal cells exhibit alterations in key signaling pathways related to cell death, anabolism and catabolism in comparison to the healthy control.

ad-ipsc neurons show a distinct gene expression pattern of alzheimer-associated genes of genome wide association studies compared to h <dig> neurons
to further analyze the reflection of alzheimer-specific gene expression patterns in our ipsc-based model system we performed data mining to extract disease relevant gene expression using an alzheimer gene list recently published by the european alzheimer’s disease initiative   <cit> . the cluster analysis in figure  <dig> showed that ad-ips <dig> neurons and ad-ips <dig> neurons were more similar to each other than to h <dig> neurons. basically there are six gene clusters:  a cluster of genes expressed in all experiments such as apoe and app,  a cluster of genes expressed in no experiment such as cass <dig> and cr <dig>   a cluster of genes expressed in both ad-ipsc neuron experiments but not in the h <dig> neuron experiment such as ptk2b and picalm,  a singleton cluster of hla-drb <dig> not expressed in both ad-ips neuron experiments but expressed in the h <dig> neurons,  a singleton cluster of mef2c not expressed in ad-ips26b experiments but expressed in ad-ips <dig> and the h <dig> neurons and  a cluster of genes expressed in ad-ips26b neurons but not in ad-ips <dig> and h <dig> neurons containing genes such as slc24a <dig> and abca <dig> figure  <dig>

ad-ipsc neurons show down-regulation of genes involved in alzheimer’s, huntington’s and parkinson’s disease compared to h <dig> neurons
analysis of differences in the ips-derived neurons when compared to the annotations alzheimer’s disease, parkinson’s disease and huntington’s disease revealed that most genes down-regulated in ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons  and ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons  were common to all three neural disorders. exclusively associated with alzheimer’s disease were  <dig> genes in ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons and  <dig> genes in in ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons. these genes were app, apoe, psenen, cdk <dig>  hsd17b <dig>  tnfrsf1a, ppp3cb, ppp3cc, chp, gapdh, capn <dig>  capn <dig>  atp2a <dig>  gsk3b, calm <dig> and calm <dig> in the experiment ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons and app, cdk <dig>  hsd17b <dig>  chp, gapdh, nae <dig>  atp2a <dig>  gsk3b, calm <dig> and calm <dig> in the experiment ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons.figure  <dig>

brain allocation of alzheimer-specific genes down-regulated in ad-ipsc neurons compared to h <dig> neurons
the expression in different brain regions of the alzheimer-exclusive genes that were found to be down-regulated in ad-ipsc neurons of one differentiation experiment were investigated using the gnf/atlas organism part. the expression of the largest set of genes was allocated to pons with 12% in the case of ad-ips <dig> neurons for the genes apoe, app, atp2a <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig>  capn <dig>  cdk <dig>  gapdh, gsk3b and ppp3cb  and 13% in ad-ips26b neurons for the genes app, atp2a <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig>  cdk <dig>  gapdh and gsk3b . this was followed by globus pallidus with 9% in ad-ips <dig> neurons for the genes app, atp2a <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig>  cdk <dig>  gapdh and ppp3cb and 9% in ad-ips26b neurons for the genes app, atp2a <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig>  cdk <dig> and gapdh. the percentages for medulla oblongata, prefrontal cortex and amygdala were found to be 5–8% .

an alzheimer-relevant functional protein association network can be built using an alzheimer-specific gene set down-regulated in ad-ipsc neurons compared to h <dig> neurons
to further specify the reflected alzheimer-related phenotype in our ipsc-based neuronal disease model we constructed protein association networks by means of the gene expression data generated from one differentiation experiment. therefore, protein-interaction networks were generated using genes annotated with ad pathway that are down-regulated in ad-ips <dig> neurons vs. h <dig> neurons, in ad-ips26b neurons vs. h <dig> neurons as well as the overlap of both datasets. we successfully modeled the association of alzheimer-related proteins within our cellular system in both ad-ips neuronal differentiation experiments through the subsequent comparison to non-ad embryonic stem cell line h <dig> neuronal cells and further network construction by applying stringv <dig>  the generated networks in figures  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> depict associations between proteins in a color code. the color of the line between proteins represents the following evidence categories: neighborhood in the genome , gene fusion , co-occurrence across genomes , co-expression , experimental/biochemical data , association in curated databases  and co-mentioning in pubmed abstracts/textmining evidence .figure  <dig>

the protein association networks built from genes down-regulated in ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons in figure  <dig> contains  <dig> more alzheimer-related proteins than the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons network in figure  <dig>  these proteins are ndufb <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  atp5g <dig>  capn <dig>  uqcrq, ndufa <dig>  capn <dig>  ndufs <dig>  sdhb, tnfrsf1a, casp <dig>  apoe, sdhd, ppp3cb, ppp3cc and psenen . however, the two proteins ndufa <dig> and nae <dig> are only part of a network built from the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons dataset . interestingly, both interaction networks contain app and gsk3Β as well as cdk <dig> and hsd17b <dig>  in the ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons and not in the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons network app is depicted to be associated with casp <dig> and apoe by experimental evidence and textmining evidence as well as with psenen, however, only via textmining evidence . in addition, only the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons network depicts the association of app and nae <dig> through co-expression, database, experimental and textmining evidence . furthermore, only in the ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons and not in the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons network functional associations between casp <dig> and cdk <dig>  capn <dig>  tnfrsf1a, calm <dig>  apoe and cox4i <dig> that are proven by textmining evidence could be found. tnfrsf1a which is only a part of the network in figure  <dig> is associated with cdk <dig>  calm <dig> by textmining evidence and with casp <dig> with additional database evidence. exclusively in this protein association network apoe, which plays a major role in alzheimer pathogenesis, is associated with casp <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig> and gapdh by textmining evidence whereas capn <dig> is associated with casp <dig>  calm <dig> and calm <dig> by textminig evidence. surprisingly, no associations could be found for capn <dig> in this network. additional proteins only part of the ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons network are ppp3cc and ppp3cb both of which are associated with each other by co-occurrence, database, experimental and textmining evidence. they are associated with calm <dig> and calm <dig> with experimental and textmining evidence. psenen, a subunit of the γ-secretase complex, occurs only in this protein association network and is associated with uqcrh via textmining and co-expression evidence. additional proteins exclusively part of the ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons network are ndufs <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  ndufa <dig>  ndufb <dig>  uqcrq, atp5g <dig>  sdhb and sdhd. these are part of a complex protein association network-cluster mainly consisting of proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation . interestingly, ndufa <dig> is only part of the protein association network based on the genes in the ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons dataset .

the network built from the genes overlapping between the ad-ips <dig> vs. h <dig> neurons and ad-ips26b vs. h <dig> neurons datasets in figure  <dig>  shows associations with experimental and textmining evidence of app with hsd17b <dig>  gapdh, cdk <dig>  gsk3b and snca. in addition, database evidence to prove the association of app, snca and gapdh could be found. associations with textmining evidence between cdk <dig> with calm <dig> and calm <dig> as well as between gapdh and atp2a, calm <dig>  calm <dig>  sdha, atp5b and atp5j could be found by our method. furthermore, the interaction of gapdh with atp5b and atp5j is associated with co-expression evidence in this network. gapdh is associated with chp via experimental evidence. additional alzheimer-related genes are interconnected to a complex protein association network cluster similar to figures  <dig> and  <dig>  consisting of proteins like ndufb <dig>  atp5e, ndufb <dig>  uqcrc, ndufb <dig>  ndufb <dig>  atp5b, ndufab <dig>  ndufb <dig> that are mainly involved in oxidative phosphorylation or in the electron transport chain in mitochondria. in our alzheimer-related protein association network in figure  <dig> we found experimental evidence association between snca and ndufb <dig> as well as the co-expression evidence interactions of hsd17b <dig> with ndufv <dig>  ndufb <dig>  uqcrh and atp5j. these associations connect alzheimer-specific app, gsk3b, cdk <dig>  calm <dig>  calm <dig> and atp2a <dig> with proteins involved in alzheimer related failure of the function of mitochondrial processes of the respiratory chain of the protein association cluster. a further association to proteins involved in oxidative phorphorylation are the interactions of gapdh with atp5j, atp5b and sdha .

a subset of ups-related genes is down-regulated in ad-ipsc neurons compared to h <dig> neurons
the cluster analysis of ups-associated genes assembled both ad-ips neurons datasets into a cluster separated from the h <dig> neurons. genes were divided into three clusters   <dig> genes which have lower gene expression values in both ad-ips neuron compared to h <dig> neurons, among them psmc <dig>  psma <dig>  nedd <dig>    <dig> genes characterized by higher expression in both ad-ips neuron compared to h <dig> neurons: psmd <dig>  psmb <dig>    <dig> genes the expression of which varies between the three samples. the last cluster is subdivided into   <dig> genes with high expression values in h <dig> neurons and ad-ips <dig> neurons but not in ad-ips26b neurons - psme <dig>  psmd <dig>    <dig> genes with high expression values in h <dig> neurons and ad-ips26b neurons but not in ad-ips <dig> neurons - psmd <dig>  psmd <dig>    <dig> genes with a low gene expression values in h <dig> neurons and ad-ips26b neurons and a high gene expression in ad-ips- <dig> neurons - psmd <dig>  sugt <dig>    <dig> genes with low gene expression values in h <dig> neurons and ad-ips <dig> neurons and a high gene expression values in ad-26b neurons - psme <dig>  psmb <dig> .figure  <dig>

little is known about the clinical onset and course of sporadic ad due to the limited insight and access to brain-derived neuronal cells from patients afflicted with neurodegenerative diseases. therefore, it is essential that we develop new in-vitro-based experimental models that may reflect affected nerves in the brain. thus, an early diagnosis could help in this regard to treat the affected individuals effectively and to test preventive approaches of sporadic alzheimer’s disease treatment. in recent time, several research groups independently and successfully differentiated somatic cells of ad patients directly or by ipsc-based approaches into neuronal cells, and examined them with respect to the molecular basis of disease development  <cit> .

the results of these studies lead to valuable insights regarding understanding of ad molecular disease, given that these innovative and predictive patient cell models displayed the ad phenotype  <cit> . in our current study, we confirmed that dermal fibroblasts derived from sporadic ad patients could be induced to a pluripotent state  and further differentiated into neuronal cells in one reprogramming and one neuronal differentiation experiment per derived ad-ipsc clone. the transcriptomes of the derived neuronal cells were characterized by the expression of neuronal markers such as galc, map <dig>  vamp <dig>  hes <dig>  sox <dig>  prom <dig> and ad-specific gene expression patterns when compared to control neuronal cells. we successfully generated an alzheimer’s disease-related protein association network using detected ad-related alterations of the transcriptome. as a control we used neuronal cells generated from the female embryonic stem cell line h <dig> in our study. this is a very clean background, it might be argued that some of the disease associated effects we see in our model come from differences between embryonic stem cells and ips cells in general or are related to the advanced age of the ad patient  whose cells were used in this study. an effect of the age-related high mutation load in the parental fibroblast compared to h <dig> cannot be excluded but could be significant since ad is an aged-related disease and as such one would expect a higher mutation load in patients. an age-matched control ips cell line would have been an alternative to h <dig> for our study. many ipsc-based disease models compare the effect of mutations in a disease associated gene within the same genetic background. the parental fibroblasts used for ad-ipsc generation in this study did not carry any mutations in alzheimer-related genes which excluded the possibility to use the same genetic background in our case. based on the fact that fabp <dig> a gene involved in neuronal development  <cit>  is not expressed in h <dig> neurons, one could argue that the mixture of neuronal subtypes found in the neuronal differentiation of h <dig> is distinct from the neuronal differentiations of ad ipscs. despite possible differences in neuronal differentiation efficiencies or mixture of neuronal subtypes we see altered expression of ad-related genes in two neuronal differentiations of ad patient fibroblast derived ips cell lines compared to the neuronal differentiation of h <dig> used as a control.

at the protein level, the neuronal cells which we derived from sporadic ad-ipscs in a single neuronal differentiation experiment expressed p-tau and gsk3b, both valid as neuropathological proteins. analysis of the brain of sporadic ad patients often shows intracellular accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, an early event preceding the appearance of nft in ad  <cit> . physiological, gsk3β is a multifunctional protein kinase that phosphorylates a variety of substrates including the tau protein, which is associated with neuronal-specific microtubules. surprisingly, in our cell model we observed the up-regulation of both isoforms of the gsk3α and gsk3β protein as well as clear formation of abnormal p-tau  in ad-ipsc derived neuronal cells in comparison to their parental fibroblast cells, which expressed minute levels of gskαβ and no tau.

in a recently published study on neuronal cells derived from ad-ipsc of familial ad, abnormal p-tau expression was not detected by western blotting, probably due to the short time scale in culture  <cit> . nevertheless, another study could show increased p-tau in both familial and one sporadic ad sample, however measured by the msd phospho tau kit  <cit> . in the same study high amounts of gsk3β were measured in induced neuronal cells from an ad donor, this is in accordance with the observation in our ad-ipsc derived neuronal cells.

global gene expression analysis revealed up-regulation of ad-related pathways in ad-ips neurons of one neuronal differentiation experiment for each ad-ips cell line such as wnt, the lysosome signalling pathway and glutathion metabolism all of which have been shown to be altered in alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . interestingly, we detected altered expression of genes that are involved in the alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. a very recent work showed through meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies involving  <dig> alzheimer cases that changes in glutamate metabolism are overrepresented in data from patients with ad  <cit> .

in addition, biological processes involving response to oxygen radical and response to oxidative stress were up-regulated in our sporadic ad model. indeed these processes are known to be up-regulated in alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . moreover, biological processes such as neurogenesis appeared to be up-regulated, underlining successful neuronal differentiation. the mixture of neuronal subtypes generated by our neuronal differentiation experiments might vary as we did not carry out subtype specific differentiations.

a cluster analysis of the expression of ad-associated genes recently published confirmed differential expression in the generated ad-ips neurons compared to h <dig> neurons  <cit> .

even though  <dig> of  <dig> genes of the cluster analysis of alzheimer-related genes seemed to be expressed in a similar manner in h <dig> neurons compared to ad-ips neurons, the transcriptomes of ad-ips neurons were more similar to each other than to h <dig> neurons despite a possible variation of neuronal subtype mixtures in the conducted neuronal differentiation experiments. differential behavior between both ad-ips neurons experiments and the h <dig> neurons experiment points to genes whose up-regulation  or down-regulation  may play a major role in development of the disease in this patient.

while ptk2b, il <dig> and hla-drb <dig> are clearly involved in alzheimer pathology  <cit> , there are controversial studies about the involvement of picalm in alzheimers disease  <cit> .

the genes exoc3l <dig>  clu, cr <dig> and tnk <dig> although associated with ad were not found to be expressed in ad-ips neurons. the gene exoc3l <dig> has been associated with late onset alzheimer disease  in gwas  <cit> . however, it could be shown that the association is likely to be caused by the close location to apoe and there was found no more evidence after adjustment for apoe  <cit> . our results showing no expression for exoc3l <dig> in ad-ips <dig> and ad-ips26b neurons are in line with that finding.

the ad-association with tnk <dig> which was also not expressed significantly in our experiments is unclear as several studies report ambiguous results  <cit> .

in contrast to that, differentially expressed genes in ad-ips neurons revealed the down-regulation of pathways annotated to alzheimer’s disease, huntington’s disease and parkinson’s disease. the overlap of down-regulated gene expression related to alzheimer’s disease, huntington’s disease and parkinson’s disease in our ad-ips neuronal cells in figures  <dig> and  <dig> supports the notion of a pathological mechanism common to these three neurodegenerative diseases  <cit> .

sixteen alzheimer’s disease-specific genes could be confirmed to be down-regulated in ad-ips <dig>  and  <dig> genes in ad-ips26b compared to h <dig> neurons . these genes could be allocated to brain regions which are affected by alzheimer’s disease depicted in figure 4b and c. in both ad-ips neuron experiments the largest number of alzheimer-related genes was allocated to pons. indeed, pons has been reported to have a smaller volume in patients with familial alzheimer’s disease  <cit> . the second largest gene set was allocated to the brain region globus pallidus for both ad-ips neuronal cells, a brain region which was reported to be involved in alzheimers disease  <cit> . finally, the medulla oblongata and amygdala brain regions which show deregulated gene expression in ad ips neurons in our model were reported to be affected in ad  <cit> .

we could successfully generate a protein association network consisting of ad-specific genes down-regulated in ad-ips neurons compared to h <dig> neurons. the networks reflects the differences between the two ad-ips neurons as there are more alzheimer risk genes  present in the network built from ad-related genes down-regulated in ad-ips <dig> neurons against healthy h <dig> neurons. despite these differences the construction of a string-based protein association network representing the ad phenotype was possible with our approach for both ad-ips neuron cell populations. app, a protein which plays a central role in the pathology of alzheimer’s disease, is part of the protein association network in both ad-ips neuron cultures as well as in the association network built from the overlap of both experiments. several studies report protein interaction networks characterizing the molecular disease phenotype in post mortem brains of sporadic ad patients or patients with familial alzheimer disease  <cit> . despite the usefulness of these networks for gaining insights into molecular changes in the final stage of ad, no information can be drawn about the early molecular pathology of ad with this approach. generating ips from ad patients in the early stage of the disease would allow modeling disease-specific changes in the ad-related protein association network over time, which provides valuable information of the development of new therapy approaches at early stages. so far, our study is the first demonstration of a protein interaction network of ad-ips neurons derived from skin cells from an 82-year-old sporadic ad patient. modeling sporadic ad using ips technology as presented here enables us to formulate hypotheses to increase our understanding of ad pathogenetic mechanisms and test them by monitoring the effect on the protein association network.

next to differential gene expression of ad-specific genes in ad-ips derived neurons we detected the down-reglation of genes in ad-ips neuronal cells that play a major role in the ups. our data revealed that the majority of the ups-related genes are down-regulated in ad-ips neurons compared to h <dig> neurons, suggesting that ups functionality is lowered in our ad-ips neurons but not in healthy h <dig> neurons. indeed, ups deficiency has been associated with ad pathology  <cit> . these results suggest that our alzeimer model very likely reflects ups-related features of ad pathology which are most probably present in the neuronal cells of the sporadic ad patients.

furthermore, the ups-related gene expression data suggests that both the constitutive and inducible proteasome play a role in ad pathology. this is reflected in the lower gene expression of the main constitutive subunits of the proteasome psmb5/6/ <dig> in ips-derived neuronal cells from the ad patient compared to h <dig> neurons and the higher gene expression of psmb <dig> in both ad-ips neurons compared to h <dig> neurons. the genes psmb <dig> and psmb <dig>  the expression of which is higher than in h <dig> neurons only in the case of ad-ips26b neurons are probably less important in ad-related pathology driven by the ups as their expression showed a higher variation. indeed, constitutive proteolytic activities have been reported to be decreased in ad brains, meanwhile the composition of the proteasome complex is not affected  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast to the constitutive proteolytically-active subunits, the inducible ones have been reported to be highly expressed in the hippocampus  of severe diseased ad patients   <cit> .

in addition, we found that the expression of the gene nedd <dig> is down-regulated in ad-ips neurons compared to the control. it is known that nedd <dig> plays a role in ad pathology. the app binding protein- <dig>  is also increased in the ad-affected hc  <cit> . app-bp <dig> associates with uba <dig> resulting in an e1-like activating enzyme for the process of nedd <dig>  an ubiquitin-like protein  <cit> . however, nedd <dig> was additionally found to be present in high amounts in neurofibrillary tangles  and senile plaques from a patient with ad  <cit> , which would suggest that nedd <dig> is up-regulated in ad, which we do not see in our ips-based model. our data suggests that ups dysfunction may occur early in ad pathogenesis eventually leading to cellular protein aggregates later on.

using our neuronal cell model, we provide a proof of principle that neuronal cells differentiated from patient dermal fibroblasts-derived ips cells offer a valuable tool for modeling early molecular pathology of ad, screening and development of appropriate drugs for the treatment of ad in the future. however, our results suggest that the different ipsc clones even derived from the same individual may give rise to different responses which is reflected in the differences between the two protein association networks generated from the gene expression data of the two different ad-ips clones differentiated to neuronal cells in one experiment each. in our study we generated two sporadic ad-ipsc lines: one  exhibited complete teratoma formation and normal karyotype whilst the other cell line  showed karyotype abnormalities and failed to differentiate into endoderm in-vivo. due to the fact that the teratoma assay is not standardized  <cit>  the trend now is towards a transcriptome-based classification of pluripotency  rather than the traditional teratoma-based assay  <cit> . interestingly, only ad-ips26b responded to the γ-secretase-inhibitor ce treatment in one inhibitor treatment experiment. this would suggest that the selection of ipsc clones is critical to enable the generation of results that are clinically relevant. however, neurons from ad-ips <dig> showed a higher number of ad-related genes that are deregulated compared to ad-ips26b neurons as reflected in the different protein association networks built from these two neuronal cell differentiation experiments. therefore, the failure to respond to ce could be a reflection of this difference in ad-related gene expression between the two clones. our findings, although based on a limited number of ad-ipscs, have highlighted the fact that molecular pathology of sporadic alzheimer can be modelled in disease-related protein association networks by means of ipsc technology and transcriptome analysis. abnormalities of the karyotype in the parental ad-ips cells should be avoided but as in our case do not necessarily lead to a distortion of gene expression-based ad protein association networks with this approach.

CONCLUSIONS
in summary, we have generated patient-specific pluripotent stem cells from skin fibroblasts of an 82-year-old woman suffering from sporadic ad and induced these to differentiate into neuronal cells. the patient-derived cells recapitulated key features of the disease, including the expression of p-tau, gsk3β, down-regulation of ad-related genes and altered biological features caused by differential expression of genes involved in e.g. the ups or response to oxidative stress.

the majority of the ups genes are down-regulated in ad neurons, thus supporting the idea that dysfunctions in this system may occur early in ad pathogenesis and then lead to cellular protein aggregates at later stages of the disease. additionally, a few genes were distinctly up-regulated in neurons derived from the two ad-ipsc lines. this may suggest that these genes are less important for ad pathogenesis as their expression varies among different neuronal lines.

in essence, we have successfully generated an alzheimer-related protein association network using characteristic gene expression patterns detected in ad-ipscs compared to a healthy control of one neuronal differentiation experiment. our results lend further support to the fact that neuronal cells differentiated from ipscs from sporadic ad patients in part recapitulate the neuropathological processes of the disease. we anticipate that ipsc-based modeling of ad as demonstrated here can be useful for formulating testable hypotheses that might eventually enhance our meager knowledge of the molecular basis of its progression and should eventually lead to the development of new drugs to prevent or treat this disease.
