BACKGROUND
e2f transcription factors control exit from cell quiescence and progression through g <dig> and s phase entry  <cit> . in mammalian cells, e2f consists of a family of related proteins that includes eight members which pair with a heterodimeric partner   <cit> . the first three family members, e2f <dig>   <dig> and 3a, are primarily considered as transcriptional activators. their functions are partially redundant and simultaneous abrogation of the three is lethal at an early embryonic stage  <cit> . unlike e2f <dig>   <dig> or 3a, e2f <dig> and  <dig> have mostly been described as transcriptional repressors, at least in fibroblasts  <cit> . however, in rapidly renewing tissues such as bone marrow, skin and digestive tract where e2f <dig> is predominantly expressed  <cit> , this latter e2f family member appears to act as an activator of both transcription and cell cycle progression. indeed, in mice, deletion of the e2f <dig> gene causes a reduction in the number of erythrocytes due to impaired proliferation of progenitors in bone marrow  <cit> . in skin, overexpression of e2f <dig> results in hyperproliferation of basal keratinocytes and induces hyperplasia  <cit> . in the small intestine, loss of e2f <dig> results in a significant decline in proliferative zones  and a shortening of intestinal villi  <cit> . in contrast, loss of e2f <dig> expression does not affect intestinal development or homeostasis  <cit> . in addition, e2f <dig> is also strongly and preferentially expressed in proliferative zones of embryonic mouse intestine  <cit>  and human fetal intestinal epithelium  <cit> . finally and more importantly, inhibition of e2f <dig> expression by rna interference in normal and cancerous intestinal epithelial cells reveals that e2f <dig> is necessary for s-phase entry and proliferation  <cit> .

several reports indicate that subcellular localization of e2f <dig> controls its transcriptional activity  <cit> . accordingly, we have recently shown that the cellular localization of e2f <dig> is cell cycle-dependent in normal intestinal epithelial cells. indeed, in contrast to e2f <dig>  which constitutively resides in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, e2f <dig> is mostly distributed in the cytoplasm of quiescent intestinal crypt cells and translocates into the nucleus upon serum stimulation  <cit> . hence, this suggests that cytoplasmic sequestration or nuclear export of e2f <dig> may provide a means to control its transcriptional activity. however, the intracellular mechanisms by which serum growth factors induce e2f <dig> nuclear translocation remain to be identified.

herein, we show that activation of mek/erk signaling by serum is required for e2f <dig> nuclear translocation as well as for g1/s phase transition of human non immortalized intestinal epithelial crypt cells  in culture. our results demonstrate that erk1/ <dig> directly and rapidly phosphorylates e2f <dig> following serum stimulation and is correlated with its increased transcriptional activity and s phase entry. however, although epidermal growth factor  treatment resulted in rapid activation of erk1/ <dig>  it was not sufficient to promote e2f <dig> translocation into the nucleus or g1/s phase transition in hiec. additional gsk <dig> inhibition was required for these events to occur in presence of egf. finally, we show that e2f <dig> is overexpressed, phosphorylated and localized in the nucleus of epithelial cells from colorectal adenomas exhibiting apc and kras or braf mutations. taken together, our results emphasize the importance of regulating e2f <dig> localization for proliferation in normal human intestinal epithelial cells as well as in intestinal tumors.

RESULTS
mek/erk pathway is required for e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition of hiec
we have previously shown that e2f <dig> is required for proper expression of many cell cycle regulatory proteins controlling g1/s phase transition and for proliferation of normal human intestinal epithelial cells   <cit> . in contrast to e2f <dig>  which is constitutively localized in the nucleus, e2f <dig> has a diffuse cytoplasmic localization in quiescent hiec and a nuclear localization in proliferative cells suggesting that its localization is regulated by signaling pathways activated by mitogens  <cit> . in light of the above, we analyzed the signaling pathways that could be involved in serum-induced e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and g1/s phase transition in hiec. we first verified the involvement of the mek/erk pathway given that we had previously demonstrated that sustained activation of erk1/ <dig> is required for intestinal epithelial cells to enter s-phase  <cit> . among physiological events relevant for g1/s phase transition, there is the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma gene product prb by cyclin d/cdk <dig>  and cyclin e/cdk <dig> complexes, which causes the release and activation of e2f/dp transcription factors  <cit> . e2f <dig> localization and hyperphosphorylation of prb were therefore analyzed following treatment of hiec with serum in absence or presence of u <dig>  a potent inhibitor of mek1/ <dig> . as expected, addition of  <dig> μm u <dig> to hiec potently inhibited serum-induced erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation  without affecting phosphorylation of other signaling kinases such as erk <dig> and akt . of note, the stimulatory effect of serum on cyclin d <dig> expression, p <dig> down-regulation and prb hyperphosphorylation was also abolished by u <dig>  furthermore, u <dig> treatment totally prevented nuclear translocation of e2f <dig> in response to serum .

e2f <dig> is phosphorylated by erk upon serum stimulation
western blot analysis of e2f <dig> revealed that  <dig> min serum stimulation with or without u <dig> did not affect the total expression levels of e2f <dig> , even after  <dig> h stimulation . however, when using higher-resolution gels, three major bands of approximately 60– <dig> kda were detected in serum-deprived hiec, whereas only one band with a lower electrophoretic mobility was observed in serum-stimulated cells after  <dig> min . of note, treatment with u <dig> abolished erk phosphorylation and markedly reduced the expression of this latter prominent band . similar results were obtained when we used the more specific and potent mek inhibitor pd <dig> . we therefore investigated whether e2f <dig> phosphorylation could be responsible for this occurrence. e2f <dig> was immunoprecipitated from serum-deprived or serum-stimulated hiec. beads containing e2f <dig> immune complexes were then incubated with the serine/threonine phosphatase pp <dig> in order to dephosphorylate serine/threonine residues on e2f <dig>  as shown in figure 2b, immunoprecipitated e2f <dig> exhibited three bands in control hiec, in contrast to one prominent band in serum-stimulated cells. of interest, treatment of e2f <dig> immunoprecipitates from serum-stimulated cells with the pp <dig> phosphatase modified the electrophoretic profile of e2f <dig>  reducing the amount of the slower migrating form of e2f <dig>  moreover, the use of antibodies recognizing phosphorylated serine revealed that e2f <dig> was phosphorylated on serine residue upon serum stimulation . of note, the levels of phosphorylated serine residues in immunoprecipitated e2f <dig> were not completely reduced by u <dig> treatment, suggesting that e2f <dig> could also be phosphorylated in absence of serum and erk activation in quiescent hiec as we previously observed  <cit> . kinase assays with active recombinant erk <dig> confirmed that erk <dig> strongly phosphorylated immunoprecipitated ha-tagged e2f <dig> in vitro . these results clearly indicate that e2f <dig> is phosphorylated on serine residue in response to serum in a mek-dependent manner. the data also suggest erk1/ <dig> as candidate kinases.

phosphorylation of e2f <dig> on serines  <dig> and  <dig> promotes its transcriptional activity
we identified seven putative erk phosphorylation sites followed by a proline residue in e2f <dig> human sequence: t <dig>  s <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig>  s <dig>  t <dig> and s <dig>  each of these specific serine/threonine residues was mutated into alanine. as shown in figure 3a, mutation of serines  <dig> and  <dig> resulted in modification of the e2f <dig> electrophoretic profile in 293t cells, decreasing the amount of the slower migrating forms of e2f <dig>  of note, these slower migrating forms almost completely disappeared when both serines were mutated into alanine . accordingly, the s244a, s384a and the s244a/s384a mutants were much less phosphorylated by recombinant erk <dig> in in vitro kinase assays . finally, the effect of e2f <dig> phosphorylation on e2f <dig> site-dependent transcription was measured on the thymidine kinase promoter, which represents the physiological e2f target gene  <cit> . mutation of each of these serines into phosphomimetic sites, namely s244e, s384e and s244e/s384e, significantly increased the transcriptional activity of e2f <dig> , confirming the involvement of the phosphorylation of these residues in the control of e2f <dig> transcriptional activity. to verify if mutations of serines  <dig> and  <dig> also alter the localization of e2f <dig>  the s244a, s384a and the s244a/s384a e2f <dig> mutants were transiently expressed in hiec and analyzed for their subcellular localization. as shown in figure 3e, when overexpressed, wild-type e2f <dig> was mainly found into the cytoplasm but also in a minor proportion into the nucleus. by contrast, all the phosphomimetic mutants were consistently less expressed into the cytoplasm and more detected into the nucleus, correlating with their increased transcriptional activity . nevertheless, the observation of some cytoplasmic staining for the phospho-mimetic mutants indicate that other mechanisms than phosphorylation might also be involved in the control e2f <dig> nuclear translocation.

egf neither induces e2f <dig> phosphorylation and nuclear translocation nor g1/s phase transition in hiec
to better understand the mechanisms controlling subcellular e2f <dig> localization during g1/s phase transition in hiec, we analyzed the impact of growth factors such as egf and lysophosphatidic acid  on these events. egf is a classical growth factor that can activate many intracellular signaling cascades including the erk1/ <dig> map kinase cascade  <cit> . in addition, we and others have previously demonstrated that egf induces proli-feration of rat immortalized intestinal epithelial cells in a mek-dependent manner  <cit> . in the present series involving human intestinal epithelial cells, although egf treatment resulted in a rapid and sustained activation of erk1/ <dig>  and in a modest induction of cyclin d <dig>  it was not sufficient to mimic serum-induced cyclin a expression, p <dig> down-regulation and prb hyperphosphorylation . importantly, in contrast to serum, egf stimulation did not trigger e2f <dig> translocation into the nucleus and no ki <dig> staining was observed . of note, western blot analysis with an anti-e2f <dig> antibody revealed three major bands in egf-stimulated hiec similar to controls, whereas e2f <dig> displayed a typical phosphorylated low electrophoretic mobility in serum-stimulated cells . neither prb hyperphosphorylation nor ki <dig> staining was observed in the presence of lower and higher egf concentrations ranging from  <dig> ng/ml to  <dig> ug/ml , thus eliminating the likelihood of overactivation or underactivation of egf receptors. furthermore, hiec proliferation was not enhanced even after several days of incubation with egf . hence, these results indicate that egf by itself is not able to trigger s phase entry and proliferation of normal human non immortalized intestinal epithelial crypt cells.

we next investigated the impact of lpa, a biologically active lysophospholipid that mediates a plethora of cellular effects, including cell proliferation of many cell types such as fibroblasts, breast cancer cells, mesangial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, neuronal cells and human colorectal cancer cells  <cit> . as shown in figure 4a and b, similarly to serum stimulation, lpa clearly induced erk1/ <dig> phos-phorylation and hiec cell cycle entry as visualized by prb hyperphosphorylation, cyclin d <dig> expression, cyclin a expression, decreased p <dig> expression, e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and ki <dig> staining. western blot analysis with anti-e2f <dig> antibody also indicated that lpa induced e2f <dig> phosphorylation to a level comparable to that observed with serum . thus, in contrast to egf, lpa is sufficient to promote phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of e2f <dig> as well as s-phase entry demonstrating that lpa is an important contributing serum growth factor for hiec.

gsk <dig> inhibition is required for phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of e2f <dig> as well as g1/s phase transition in hiec
in order to elucidate why egf, in contrast to lpa and serum, failed to induce g1/s phase transition in hiec, we analyzed the phosphorylation levels of gsk3β. gsk3β is a constitutively active serine/threonine kinase featured in two signaling pathways that are of particular importance for intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and colorectal cancer: the wnt/β-catenin pathway and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase /akt pathway  <cit> . indeed, akt phosphorylates gsk3β on serine  <dig>  leading to inhibition of its constitutive kinase activity. gsk3β is also a component of wnt signaling, which is thought to block gsk3-mediated β-catenin phosphorylation, leading to the accumulation and nuclear translocation of β-catenin  <cit> . as shown in figure 5a, serum markedly induced phosphorylation levels of akt and gsk3β after both  <dig> min and  <dig> h stimulation. by contrast, stimulation of hiec with egf only transiently increased phosphorylation of akt and gsk3β. interestingly, lpa induced a more sustained akt and gsk3β phosphorylation .

these results prompted us to verify whether gsk <dig> inhibition was necessary for e2f <dig> phosphorylation and nuclear translocation as well as g1/s phase transition in hiec. to test this hypothesis, a specific gsk <dig> inhibitor  was used. hiec were serum-starved for  <dig> h, pre-treated  <dig> min with sb <dig> and then stimulated for  <dig> min or  <dig> h with egf. as shown in figure 5b, a  <dig> h-treatment of hiec with egf or gsk <dig> inhibitor alone was not sufficient to significantly induce expression of cyclin d <dig>  p <dig> down-regulation or prb hyperphosphorylation in contrast to serum. however, significant prb hyperphosphorylation as well as cyclin d <dig> expression and p <dig> down-regulation were observed in presence of egf and sb <dig>  furthermore, inhibition of gsk <dig> significantly reduced phosphorylation of glycogen synthase  but enhanced the capacity of egf to promote e2f <dig> phosphorylation . accordingly, in presence of sb <dig>  egf significantly induced e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and ki <dig> staining .

e2f <dig> is overexpressed, phosphorylated and nuclear localized in human colorectal adenomas
both mek/erk and gsk <dig> signaling pathways are thought to be affected in early stages of colorectal cancer formation due to frequent mutations in kras/braf and apc genes respectively  <cit> . we therefore verified the protein status of e2f <dig> in human colorectal adenomas. as shown in figure 6a and b, adenomas displayed significantly higher expression levels of e2f <dig> in comparison to their corresponding benign epithelium . more importantly, all normal specimens analyzed  presented hypophosphorylated forms of e2f <dig>  whereas all adenoma samples  exhibited hyperphosphorylated forms of e2f <dig>  . furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that e2f <dig> protein was especially overexpressed in the nucleus of all epithelial cells in colorectal adenomas  while only localized in the nucleus of certain cells along the colonic crypt, presumably in proliferative cells  as previously demonstrated  <cit> . of note, all of the adenomas analyzed exhibited apc inactivating mutations  in combination with kras  or braf  activating mutations. hence, these results emphasize the close correlation between the phosphorylation of e2f <dig> and its nuclear localization.

discussion
the intestinal epithelium is the most vigorously self-renewing tissue in adult mammals. perturbations of normal tissue homeostasis attributable to genetic lesions or environmental insults can lead to hyperproliferative diseases of the intestinal tract such as cancer  <cit> . intestinal epithelial cell regulation has been studied extensively and has revealed canonical wnt/β-catenin, kras/mapk and pi3k/akt signaling pathways as key regulators of cell division and differentiation  <cit> . normal cell division is a tightly controlled process that only allows cells to divide in a timely and restricted manner. as such, e2f transcription factors control cell division by activating the transcription of numerous genes involved in g <dig> and s phases  <cit> . many previous analyses of e2f proteins in intact intestinal epithelium or in cultured crypt cells have demonstrated that nuclear e2f <dig> may be determinant in the control of proliferation. indeed, in mice, deletion of e2f <dig> gene resulted in a significant decline in proliferative zones  and a shortening of intestinal villi  <cit> . accordingly, double staining experiments in intact human intestine revealed that crypt epithelial cells expressing high levels of nuclear e2f <dig>  were all positive for ki <dig> and cyclin a  <cit> . in this respect, decreased expression of e2f <dig> by rna interference reduced the proliferation rate of normal intestinal epithelial crypt cells and colorectal cancer cells in culture  <cit> . interestingly, in contrast to e2f <dig>  which resides constitutively in the nucleus throughout the cell cycle, e2f <dig> protein is mostly distributed in the cytoplasm of quiescent cells and translocates into the nucleus upon serum stimulation  <cit> . taken together, these results suggest that the nuclear translocation of e2f <dig> may represent a critical step in promoting g1/s transition in intestinal epithelial crypt cells.

in the present study, we show that activation of the mek/erk pathway by serum is required for e2f <dig> nuclear translocation as well as for g1/s phase transition of human intestinal epithelial crypt cells. accordingly, several studies on cultured intestinal epithelial cells and many other cell types have revealed a close correlation between erk activation and dna synthesis while pharmacological or molecular inhibition of erk activity has been shown to block cell cycle progression  <cit> . notably, like e2f <dig>  <cit> , phosphorylated and activated forms of erk1/ <dig> have been mostly detected in the nucleus of undifferentiated proliferative crypt cells in human fetal small intestine  <cit> , hence supporting the role of these kinases in cell cycle control of intestinal crypt cells. therefore, our results indicate that one of the mechanisms by which erk1/ <dig> map kinases induce intestinal epithelial proliferation may be by promoting e2f <dig> nuclear translocation. once into the nucleus, e2f <dig> may control the expression of proteins necessary for entry into s phase including cdc <dig>  dihydrofolate reductase , thymidine kinase, cyclin e, cyclin a, mcm <dig> and dna polymerase α as we have previously shown  <cit> .

the exact molecular mechanism by which erk1/ <dig> promotes e2f <dig> nuclear translocation however remains unclear. herein, e2f <dig> was found to be rapidly phosphorylated on serine residue in serum-treated cells and that this phosphorylation was mek-dependent. of importance, we observed a strong correlation between the rapid phosphorylation of e2f <dig> and its subsequent nuclear translocation. hence, one could speculate that phosphorylation of e2f <dig> by erk1/ <dig> is necessary to induce its translocation into the nucleus. however, although e2f <dig> phosphorylation was observed within  <dig> minutes after serum addition, nuclear accumulation of e2f <dig> only began after  <dig> hours  <cit> . this suggests that erk-dependent e2f <dig> phosphorylation may represent an initiating event for nuclear translocation and that other mechanisms are also likely implicated. a possible mechanism could be the heterodimerization of e2f <dig> with its transcriptional partner dp- <dig>  reported to promote e2f <dig> nuclear localization and activation  <cit> . one might speculate that e2f <dig> phosphorylation could promote its association with dp- <dig> and subsequently, its nuclear re-localization. to our knowledge, few studies have demonstrated phosphorylation of e2f <dig>  <cit> , and none have linked phosphorylation to the stimulation of e2f <dig> function or transcriptional activity. we show herein that erk kinases can efficiently and directly phosphorylate e2f <dig> protein in vitro, thus identifying e2f <dig> as a novel target of erk kinases, adding to the list of erk substrates implicated in cell proliferation control  <cit> . our analysis of putative erk1/ <dig> phosphorylation sequences revealed that s <dig> and s <dig> were both implicated in the transcriptional activity of e2f <dig> and in its nuclear localization. nevertheless, more studies are needed to clearly elucidate the molecular mechanisms of e2f <dig> activity and localization by phosphorylation.

a novel and intriguing finding of this study is that stimulation with egf was not sufficient to induce g1/s phase transition of human non immortalized intestinal epithelial cells. these results contrast with those observed in rodent immortalized intestinal epithelial cell lines in which egf induced dna replication and proliferation  <cit> . furthermore, many studies have reported proliferative properties of egf in organotypic cultures of human fetal intestinal epithelium, although these studies did not exclude the contribution of other mesenchymal and epithelial factors in this effect  <cit> . many studies from our laboratory and others have clearly demonstrated that hiec are useful and relevant in analyzing the regulation of proliferation of intestinal epithelial crypt cells in humans  <cit> . indeed, the expression of intestinal epithelial-specific keratins  <cit> , of components specific to cell junctions  <cit> , cell cycle-related proteins  <cit> , as well as typical intestinal cell markers of undifferentiated lower crypt cells  <cit>  indicate that these cells behave as cells representative of the bottom of the human crypt  <cit> . their epithelial cryptal origin was also confirmed by their ability to express the 350-kd crypt cell-specific marker mim-1/ <dig>  <cit> . interestingly, we show herein that although egf induced a rapid activation of erk1/ <dig> similarly to serum and lpa, this action was not sufficient for s phase entry as visualized by the absence of prb hyperphosphorylation, cyclin a protein expression and e2f <dig> nuclear translocation. in addition, egf did not trigger the degradation of the cell cycle inhibitor p <dig>  an event necessary to exit the quiescent state and pass the restriction point  <cit> . the failure of egf to induce g1/s transition in hiec could be explained by its inability to promote a sustained phosphorylation of akt. indeed, stimulation of akt by growth factors is known to be required for g <dig> progression and s phase entry of many cell types  <cit>  including intestinal epithelial cells  <cit> . several hypotheses could be suggested to explain why egf alone is not sufficient to promote a strong and sustained akt activation in hiec. first, the nature of egfr-associated ras proteins, i.e. h-ras or k-ras, can define the selective activation of erk or akt pathway by egf  <cit> . in addition, in colon cancer, activation of the rho/rho-kinase pathway inhibits the capacity of egf to promote akt activation, but not erk1/ <dig>  <cit> . finally, erk <dig> was recently shown to be necessary for sustained pdgf-induced akt phosphorylation in endothelial cells  <cit> . further studies are thus needed to verify whether these different hypotheses could explain why egf alone did not promote a sustained akt activation in human intestinal epithelial cells.

our results also suggest that phosphorylation and inhibition of gsk3β play an important role in the nuclear translocation of e2f <dig> and the proliferative response of hiec. indeed, serum and lpa, but not egf, inactivated gsk3β as visualized by the sustained phosphorylation on serine  <dig>  probably triggered by akt or protein kinase c  <cit> . furthermore, when gsk3β was pharmacologically inhibited, egf induced prb hyperphosphorylation, cyclin d <dig> expression, p <dig> degradation and e2f <dig> nuclear translocation, four events associated with g1/s phase transition. it is noteworthy however, that inhibition of gsk <dig> only partially rescued the inability of egf to induce e2f <dig> nuclear translocation and cell proliferation in comparison to serum. this could be explained by the fact that serum contains a number of different additional factors  and hormones in high concentrations that may activate various signaling pathways including calcium mobilization and pkcs, other signaling events known to promote proliferation  <cit> . nevertheless, our results suggest that gsk3β, which is tonically active in quiescent cells, must be phosphorylated and inactivated to enable cell cycle progression of hiec. gsk3β im-plication in e2f <dig> nuclear localization control adds to the previously described role of gsk3β on e2f <dig> regulation by ubiquitination and degradation resulting in a reduced transcriptional activity  <cit> . this is also reminiscent of the observed decreased expression of several other cell cycle regulated proteins following gsk <dig> activation, including c-myc, cyclin d <dig> and β-catenin  <cit> . in this regard, accumulation of these gsk <dig> substrates has been linked to increased intestinal proliferation and notably frequently observed in colorectal cancers  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
e2f <dig> protein expression is up-regulated in human colorectal cancers  <cit> . accordingly, we have previously shown that e2f <dig> expression is necessary for both anchorage-dependent and independent growth of colorectal cancer cells  <cit> . results of the present study demonstrate that e2f <dig> protein levels were significantly enhanced in human adenomas, at an early stage of colorectal cancer. interestingly, e2f <dig> expression was mostly detected in the nucleus and appeared to be phosphorylated in adenomas. of note, the mek/erk and gsk <dig> signaling pathways, shown herein to be implicated in the regulation of e2f <dig> phosphorylation and localization, are known to be involved in colorectal adenoma formation  <cit> . hence, our findings suggest that dysregulated e2f <dig> nuclear localization may represent one of the instigating events leading to hyperproliferation and hence of tumor initiation and promotion in the colon and rectum.
