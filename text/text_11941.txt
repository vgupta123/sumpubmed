BACKGROUND
methods for elucidating the genetic architecture underlying quantitative variation in plants have evolved substantially over the last  <dig> years, following the first report of genome-wide quantitative trait locus  mapping  <cit> . the maize nested association mapping  population is composed of  <dig>  recombinant inbred lines  derived from crosses between inbred line b <dig> and  <dig> other inbred lines of maize  <cit> . these parents were selected to capture a maximum amount of molecular genetic diversity present across the major subpopulations of public maize breeding germplasm  <cit> . the maize nam population has been used to study genetic architectures for a number of quantitative traits of maize , including southern leaf blight  resistance  <cit> .

southern leaf blight is a foliar disease of maize caused by the fungus cochliobolus heterostrophus. the disease was responsible for a major epidemic in the u.s. in the 1970’s  <cit>  and continues to limit or threaten maize production worldwide. natural variation in resistance to slb is polygenic and may involve a diverse array of functional genes and pathways  <cit> . using joint linkage mapping  and genome-wide association study  the genetic architecture of resistance to slb in the nam population was associated with more than  <dig> loci with small additive effects  <cit> . with the recent release of maize hapmap <dig>  <cit>  and a denser linkage map based on genotyping-by-sequencing  with markers positioned every  <dig>  cm, qtl identified by jlm can be more precisely localized on the genetic and physical sequence maps. the denser linkage map is also expected to permit more accurate projection of the more than  <dig> m snps among parental lines in maize hapmaps  <dig> and  <dig> onto nam rils, which should provide mapping precision to the limits dictated by linkage and disequilibrium in this population.

two-stage regression analysis has been widely used to test snps for associations with quantitative diseases in human , and this approach has been adopted for gwas in plants. in the first stage, observed phenotypes are regressed on covariates such as demographic, clinical, and/or environmental factors. in the second stage, the residual values from the first stage model  are regressed on genetic markers with simple- or multiple-linear regression. despite its convenience in computation, the two-stage method can result in a downwardly biased estimate of genotypic effects and loss of power in detection as a result of dependency between covariates and the tested snp genotypes  <cit> . two-stage approaches are also used to combine the complementary advantages of jlm and gwas in nam  <cit> . in the first stage, jlm is performed using a consensus linkage map to identify qtl across the genome. in the second stage, gwas is performed chromosome-by-chromosome, using separate input values for each chromosome that are obtained as residuals from the first stage qtl model, built by excluding qtl on the chromosome to be tested for gwas. the purpose of this is to adjust phenotype values used for association analysis for the effects of qtl on other chromosomes. this approach is expected to be largely free of the problem of dependency between covariates  fit in the first stage and snps tested in the second stage, since only qtl on different chromosomes than the test snps are fit as covariates.

we are working toward identifying the causal variants underlying quantitative resistance to slb, relying, in part, on the information provided by nam. the objective of this study was to re-analyze resistance to slb in the maize nam panel using the updated genetic and haplotype maps, to compare the results with those of the previous analysis, and to determine which results are more reliable. the previous jlm analysis was based on slb phenotypes measured on  <dig> rils and a linkage map of  <dig> snps  <cit> , and the previous gwas analysis was based on  <dig>  m snps of hapmap  <dig>  <cit> . since that analysis, the mixed model used to produce the phenotypic inputs to the analysis was updated to better adjust for the effect of flowering time on slb resistance phenotypes. the updated 7386-marker map has a uniform density of one marker every  <dig>  cm, but the number  of rils phenotyped and genotyped with this map is smaller than previously . therefore, a second objective of this study was to measure the influence of each of the changes in the data used for analysis  on the current two-stage jlm-association analysis in the nam panel, using slb as an example. finally, cross-validation was used to compare the prediction power of the original jlm model of kump et al.  <cit>  and the updated jlm model in the nam panel.

RESULTS
modeling the effect of flowering time on slb resistance
the statistical association between flowering time and disease resistance was complex. among the  <dig> of  <dig> possible combinations of rating × environment × nam populations for which there were sufficient data for analysis, there was no significant relationship between flowering time and slb resistance for  <dig> combinations, linear relationships for  <dig> combinations, and quadratic relationships for  <dig> combinations . only four populations exhibited a consistent relationship across ratings and environments . thus, the majority of disease ratings in every population exhibited significant but variable relationships with flowering time. the flowering time covariate effects were generally small , however, and the updated combined mixed model incorporating variation in the flowering time covariate effect only slightly altered the blups: the original and updated blups were highly correlated between entries in each population , and there were only subtle differences in the rankings of population mean effects .

precision of qtl localization and improved qtl prediction power
jlm analysis with the 7386-marker map, updated blups of  <dig> rils, and iterative optimization , identified  <dig> qtl  associated with variation in resistance to slb in the nam panel, with support intervals averaging  <dig>  cm and ranging from  <dig>  cm to  <dig>  cm . combined, the  <dig> qtl from model  <dig> were associated with 84% of the phenotypic and 98% of the genotypic variation for resistance to slb. all model  <dig> qtl had small effects; absolute values of significant  allele effects averaged  <dig>   on the 1– <dig> scale used for quantifying resistance  <cit>  . the two model  <dig> qtl with the largest resistance effects across ril families mapped to  <dig>  cm and  <dig>  cm on chromosome  <dig> table  <dig>

the jlm results are generally similar to those reported by kump et al.  <cit> , who identified  <dig> qtl , each of which had relatively small allelic effects of similar magnitude to model  <dig> qtl. to directly compare the positions of qtl from models  <dig> and  <dig>  we interpolated model  <dig> qtl peak positions onto the 7386-marker map according to the agp v <dig> physical positions of the snps identified as model  <dig> qtl peaks . the median distance between the closest matching qtl peaks of model  <dig> and  <dig> was  <dig>  cm . smaller-effect qtl tended to have larger discrepancies in position between the models.

prediction accuracy of jlm qtl models developed from original and updated inputs were compared by cross-validation. a small number of rils used in model  <dig> were not used in model  <dig> because of missing data in the original linkage map, so we identified the set of  <dig> rils in common between the original and updated data sets. qtl positions from models  <dig> and  <dig> were fit to random subsets of these rils to re-estimate the allele effects and predict phenotypes in the validation sets. on average, across  <dig> randomly sampled training and validation sets, model  <dig> had a significantly  greater prediction correlation coefficient  than model  <dig> .

sensitivity analysis
seven different qtl models  were generated using different combinations of model inputs. the inputs that varied included the genetic map , phenotypes , and ril sample sizes . qtl peak locations were generally concordant among the seven models tested . predicted phenotypic values of rils based on jlm qtl models were also similar among the models, with all correlation coefficients between model predictions greater than  <dig> .figure  <dig>

in contrast to the general stability of qtl localization and predicted phenotypic values observed among models varying for different inputs, we observed substantially lower correlations between chromosome-specific residual outcomes from these jlm qtl models . genetic map density  had the greatest impact on the correlation between residual outcomes, followed by sample size , and then the different methods for handling the flowering time covariate in generating the ril phenotypes . using identical algorithms and phenotype inputs but different marker densities  produced a correlation of  <dig>  . dropping  <dig> rils  produced a correlation of  <dig>  . the decrease in correlation due to sample size was attributed to total sample size per se and not likely to representation of particular families, since the proportional representation of each family in the total nam family did not change due to dropping lines . although original and updated blups were highly correlated as input values , their small differences resulted in qtl model residuals with much greater differences, reflected in correlations of  <dig>  to  <dig>  between residual outcomes differing only for original vs. updated blups . when multiple inputs were changed simultaneously, the correlation between residuals diminished more .table  <dig>

comparison of multiple nam gwas results for slb resistance
the original nam gwas for slb resistance used a 1106-marker map, model  <dig> qtl residuals, and  <dig>  m hapmap  <dig> snps , and identified  <dig> significant snp loci at p <1e- <dig> with rmip ≥ <dig>   <cit> . comparing the positions of the  <dig> snp associations identified with rmip ≥ <dig>  in model a to the  <dig> variant associations identified in updated model e, only 6% of the total set colocalized within 10-kb windows between the two analyses. the three-fold enrichment of associations within qtl intervals compared to all tested variants observed in the updated gwas model e  was greater than the two-fold enrichment observed in the original gwas model a .

to evaluate nam gwas sensitivity to different gwas inputs i.e. genetic map, residual inputs, and gwas marker density, four separate gwas models were compared . the comparisons of gwas analyses based on different input data sets indicated that both linkage map density  and gwas marker density  influenced the gwas results dramatically . when both linkage map and hapmap marker densities were changed simultaneously, less than 25% of associations at rmip ≥ <dig>  and 10% of associations at rimp ≥ <dig>  localized within  <dig> kb of each other across analyses .table  <dig>

rmip values for each variant are determined based on the proportion of data subsamples in which the variant was selected in a multiple regression model at a given p-value, so rmip values are subject to stochastic variation in the random sampling of data sets. therefore, some of the inconsistency among analyses may be due simply to the process of randomly sampling the complete data set  <dig> times for each analysis. we estimated the consistency of rmip values from nam gwas  by conducting five separate model e gwas analyses for all variants on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  chosen to represent chromosomes with different numbers of qtl. each of the five analyses included a unique set of  <dig> random data samples of 80% of rils to calculate rmip values from independent runs. pairwise comparisons of association analyses indicate that 72% - 81% of variants with rmip ≥ <dig> , and 88% - 100% of snps with rmip ≥ <dig>  overlapped within 10-kb windows matched between each sampling procedure . to estimate the consistency of rmip values with more subsamples, five separate model e gwas analyses were conducted by analyzing sets of  <dig> samples and  <dig> samples on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  pairwise comparisons showed that 81% - 89% of associations with rmip ≥ <dig> , and 89% - 100% of snps with rmip ≥ <dig>  overlapped within 10-kb windows when  <dig> subsamples were used to compute rmip . about 93% - 96% of variants with rmip ≥ <dig> , and 100% of snps with rmip ≥ <dig>  overlapped within 10-kb windows when  <dig> subsamples were used .

discussion
the maize nam panel is a community genetic resource for dissecting the genetic architecture of quantitative traits. it allows for the combination of high power in conventional qtl linkage mapping and high resolution in genome-wide association mapping  <cit> . we identified  <dig> qtl with small additive effects across  <dig> nam families. the 7386-marker map has  <dig>  times the marker density of the original 1106-marker map, and, importantly, it has uniform marker spacing at  <dig>  cm without gaps. the uniform spacing and denser map improved the power and precision of qtl mapping in our analysis. one of the strongest effect qtl had a discrepancy in position between qtl models  <dig> and  <dig> because it localized to a > <dig> cm gap in the 1106-marker map. the current study resolved what was previously mapped as a single qtl detected at  <dig>  cm of chromosome  <dig>  into two separate qtl at  <dig>  and  <dig>  cm. evidence from fine mapping and high-resolution bi-parental qtl studies  supports the existence of the two rather than the one qtl. thus, it appears that the increased map density improved precision of qtl position estimates despite the loss of sample size that occurred by dropping  <dig> rils in model  <dig>  this study only evaluated relatively small changes in sample size, we expect much larger effects on results for more substantial sample size changes, as shown by simulation  <cit> .

the high and uniform density of the 7386-marker map eliminates the need for interval mapping, but increases the risk of selecting collinear markers and overfitting the qtl models. in this study, we recognized and corrected collinearity problems that occurred during automated stepwise selection by inspecting results for some diagnostic signatures of collinearity: inflated allele effect estimates at marker pairs within  <dig> cm of each other, and inflated standard errors of the allele effects. linkage disequilibrium is extensive within mapping families, such that the increasing power and resolution of qtl mapping plateaus at some point with increasing numbers of markers  <cit> . we believe that there would be diminishing returns from a more dense linkage map than the current,  <dig>  cm dense linkage map , since we would not expect further qtl resolution and predictive accuracy from more markers, while the collinearity issues and computational burden would continue to increase  <cit> .

joint linkage–association mapping has been applied in a two-stage process. in the first stage, the phenotype is regressed on genetic markers to identify qtl and estimate their effects. in the second stage, the residual values adjusted by unlinked qtl are then regressed on dense hapmap snp genotypes, one chromosome at a time. the two-stage approach has several practical advantages in that it is convenient to implement as well as computationally efficient. however, the sensitivity of jlm residual outcomes to first-stage inputs contributes to variation in second-stage gwas outputs. in this study, changes in inputs  to the jlm qtl modeling had relatively minor effects on the qtl position estimates . the resulting predicted phenotypic values from the different models had average correlations of r = <dig> , but the average correlations between corresponding residual values were somewhat lower: r = <dig> . after removing qtl effects from  <dig> out of  <dig> chromosomes, the chromosome-specific residuals are composed of genetic effects  from just one chromosome plus error effects . the chromosome-specific residual values are convenient for snp testing, because they remove the effects of qtl on other chromosomes, but as a consequence, the residuals represent a lower signal to noise ratio compared to the original phenotypic values. this is unavoidable because each chromosome contributes only a fraction of the total genetic effects to a complex trait. the sensitivity of the residual outcome values to first-stage inputs highlights the difficulty of identifying individual variant effects that account for only a small proportion of the total heritability.

gwas results were unstable due to changes in the initial inputs to the qtl analysis as well as to the marker set used for association testing. only about 35% of the associated variants with rmip ≥ <dig>  localized to common 100-kb windows between analyses when the hapmap marker set was changed . the proportion of overlapping significant variants in 100-kb windows was even lower  when using different genetic maps but the same gwas markers. changing both genetic map and gwas marker inputs reduced the proportion of overlapping significant snps to between  <dig> and 21% . only four candidate genes contained variants that were significant  across all four gwas analyses in a 10-kb window . the generally poor correspondence between gwas results of the four analyses may be due in part to the highly polygenic nature of the trait. if many sequence variants with small effects control the trait, but only a small proportion of the snp associations pass stringent thresholds, then relatively small perturbations in analysis inputs could cause substantial differences in the particular snps declared as significant.

eighteen of the  <dig> candidate genes identified with gwas model e were in qtl intervals . most of the candidate gene homologs have been reported to be involved in disease resistance . leucine-rich repeat transmembrane protein kinases  regulate a wide range of developmental and defense related processes, such as hormone perception, host specific and non-host specific defense response, and wounding response  <cit> . the well-studied lrr-pk genes include rice xa <dig>   <cit> , arabidopsis fls <dig>   <cit> , and the arabidopsis elongation factor tu receptor   <cit> . the arabidopsis cytochrome p <dig> gene was previously identified as associated with resistance to necrotrophic fungi and aphids . the plant u-box  <dig>  mutant confers enhanced non race-specific resistance to fungal and bacterial pathogens in rice  <cit> . the lysine histidine transporter  <dig>  mutant of arabidopsis affects resistance to a broad spectrum of pathogens  <cit> .

the slb-associated variants identified here by jlm-gwas were found residing within some qtls reported in previous studies. maize genome bins  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> / <dig> had been identified from different studies contributing to major effects on slb resistance . the association with the highest rmip  was localized to  <dig> , <dig> bp of chromosome  <dig>  within a qtl region identified in other populations  <cit> . the nearest annotated gene to the associated snp is ~ <dig> kb downstream and encodes an rna recognition motif -containing protein . another strong variant association  was in the lht <dig> gene  on chromosome 6; this gene was previously suggested to be the causal factor for the classically defined rhm <dig> locus based on qtl fine-mapping  <cit> . one of the most significant snps  is  <dig> bp downstream of grmzm2g <dig> encoding a caffeoyl-coa o-methytransferase , within a qtl region on chromosome  <dig> identified in other populations  <cit> . ccoaomt has been reported to participate in lignin biosynthesis in plants . lignin has a particular role as a physical barrier against external pathogens, limiting the penetration of pathogens into host cells.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we recommend use of the updated jlm qtl  and gwas  results in the search for candidate genes controlling resistance to southern leaf blight. the updated qtl model had better prediction accuracy than the original model, and the updated gwas provided substantially higher marker density, which is expected to provide a better chance of identifying variants in linkage disequilibrium with causal variants. further work will attempt to validate biologically the effects of candidate genes with the strongest statistical evidence to provide more detailed insight into the genetic basis of slb resistance. finally, our results highlight the difficulties and contingencies of reliably identifying genomic variants with small effects on quantitative traits.
