BACKGROUND
tropheryma whipplei, the agent of the whipple's disease , has been recently isolated and cultured  <cit>  and is classified within the actinomycetes clade  <cit> . on the basis of sequence analysis of the 16s rrna gene, several diagnostic pcr assays targeting various parts of this gene have been reported and pcr has become an important diagnostic tool  <cit> . one of the important limits of pcr targeting the 16s rrna gene is its specificity. indeed, positive pcr results have been found in specimens from people without the classic clinical or histological features of wd. in one series, t. whipplei dna was apparently detected in  <dig> out of  <dig> waste-water samples obtained from five different sewage treatment plants in southwest germany  <cit> , and in  <dig> % of either duodenal biopsies specimens or gastric juice specimens from  <dig> patients with no clinical signs of wd  <cit> . similarly, in a random sample of  <dig> healthy people, street et al. found that 35% had t. whipplei dna detected in their saliva  <cit> . dutly et al. have also reported the presence of t. whipplei dna in saliva of healthy people  <cit> . all these data were obtained using primers targeting a part of the 16s rrna gene. in contrast, using specific primers of the 16s-23s ribosomal dna intergenic spacer   <cit>  and primers targeting a 650-bp fragment of the Î²-subunit of the rna polymerase gene   <cit> ,  <dig> saliva specimens from people without suspicion of wd failed to yield a significant pcr product signal  <cit> . maiwald et al. also reported that t. whipplei occurs only rarely in intestinal mucosa that lacks histopathologic evidence of wd  <cit> . these conflicting and confusing data emphasize the need for additional information on the prevalence of t. whipplei in healthy people, especially in saliva. for this purpose we have compared in this study the use of specific target genes repeated sequences present in seven copies in the genome of t. whipplei  <cit>  in a real-time pcr with taqman* probes, with the previously published primers targeting the 16s rrna gene  <cit>  in saliva from healthy people.

RESULTS
the sensitivity of our real-time pcr assay was of  <dig> dna copy of standard control dna. specificity was verified using dna extracted from  <dig> bacterial strains as previously described  <cit> ; none of the dna yield a positive signal for the two sets of primers and probes. although the lightcycler pcr results with both primer pairs and probes were negative for all the saliva,  <dig> and  <dig> out of  <dig> samples were positive with the primers used by dutly et al. and ramzan et al.  <cit>  and from street et al  <cit> , respectively. among the  <dig> positive samples using the primers of dutly et al.,  <dig> yielded a  <dig> bp sequence that was  <dig> % identical to that of actinomyces odontolyticus  and  <dig> yielded a  <dig> bp that was  <dig> % identical to that of actinomyces turicensis . the  <dig> sequences obtained using the primers from street et al. yielded a  <dig> bp sequence that was  <dig> % identical to that of capnocytophaga gingivalis . the 16s rrna sequences of the two available genomes of t. whipplei  were retrieved from the kegg website  <cit>  and were used for sequence alignments using the clustalw software  <cit>  with our two original sequences of a. odontolyticus  and c. gingivalis . the c. gingivalis 16s rrna sequence shares  <dig> % homology  and the a. odontolyticus 16s rrna sequence shares  <dig> % homology  with the corresponding 16s rrna sequences of the t. whipplei genomes .

discussion
in this study, using the same pcr protocols previously used for the detection of t. whipplei, the sequences obtained with primers of the 16s rrna gene were in all cases false positive pcr results with sequences similar to that of bacteria of the oral cavity and not with t. whipplei. a better sensitivity and specificity using repeated sequences instead of the 16s rrna gene has also been reported in other bacteria such as coxiella burnetii  <cit> .

thus we believe that such high prevalence of t. whipplei dna described in the saliva of healthy people reported using less specific pcr-based methods targeting the 16s rrna gene are likely due to false positive amplifications of bacteria of the oral cavity. therefore positive pcr results using the 16s rrna gene should be interpreted cautiously and sequencing should be the rule. for example, in the study of street et al., only  <dig> positive pcr products of  <dig> patients were sequenced  <cit>  yielding a 100% homology with the 16s rrna sequence of t. whipplei. since the remaining positive samples were not sequenced it is possible that other bacteria found in the oral cavity such as actinomyces spp. or c. gingivalis were the cause of the false positive results. this is particularly important when comparing the sequences in our study with the 16s rrna sequences of t. whipplei with a high percentage of homology of the sequences, especially at both the 5' and 3' ends . since we have started to perform the diagnosis of wd in our laboratory, t. whipplei dna has been demonstrated using our pcr assays in saliva from  <dig> out of  <dig>  patients without wd  <cit> . zinkernagel et al have demonstrated that the subgingival plaque may serve as a natural habitat of t. whipplei  <cit> . in this study, using a real-time quantitative pcr assay, authors found also that all samples from saliva were negative  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
asymptomatic carriers of t. whipplei in saliva may exist but their prevalence is much lower than those previously reported. testing the specificity of designed primers is critical to avoid false positive detection of t. whipplei. in atypical case we recommend to test two different specific target genes before concluding.
