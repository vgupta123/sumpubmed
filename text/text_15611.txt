BACKGROUND
the endosomal pathway of eukaryotic cells receives both biosynthetic cargo from the trans-golgi network and endocytic cargo from the cell surface  <cit> . many cargo proteins are further sorted into the internal vesicles that are a prominent morphological characteristic of the late endosome/multivesicular body   <cit> . after fusion of mvbs with lysosomes, or the vacuole , the internal vesicles and their contents are degraded. sorting into mvb lumenal vesicles is a crucial process in determining whether a membrane-associated protein is degraded or recycled. in mammalian cells, mvb sorting is essential for the downregulation of activated cell surface receptors, such as the epidermal growth factor receptor, and defective sorting is strongly associated with carcinogenesis  <cit> .

many of the components of the cellular machinery required for endosomal sorting have now been identified. in the budding yeast saccharomyces cerevisiae , three complexes known as escrt-i , escrt-ii and escrt-iii, have been shown to be essential for sorting of ubiquitinated cargo  <cit>  into lumenal vesicles of endosomes and/or their formation  <cit> . escrt-i initiates sorting into endosomal lumenal vesicles by binding ubiquitinated membrane proteins. escrt-ii, composed of vps22p , vps25p and vps36p  <cit> , functions downstream of escrt-i, and regulates the formation of escrt-iii  <cit> . mammalian equivalents of escrt-ii components have also been found, known as eap <dig> , eap <dig> , and eap <dig>   <cit> . the escrt complexes are conserved in mammalian cells  <cit> , and escrt-i and -iii have been found essential for the budding of a wide range of viruses, including hiv- <dig>  <cit> .

the crystal structure of yeast escrt-ii has recently been solved  <cit> . the complex has a trilobed 'y'-shaped topology and consists of two copies of vps25p, forming two protrusions, and one each of vps22p and vps36p, which form the third protrusion. while two copies of vps <dig> are required to form the complex, the two vps25p subunits make no direct contact with each other, with one vps25p subunit binds vps22p and the other vps36p. the most extensive interactions within escrt-ii are between vps22p and vps36p. however, as vps25p binds both vps22p and vps36p, it may facilitate assembly of escrt-ii. although these data revealed that yeast vps25p has a dual "winged helix" structure and two ppxy motifs  <cit> , vps25p has no obvious functional motifs  <cit> .

we aimed to characterize the vps <dig> family of proteins across the species, to find out more about its genetic structure and evolution, and to identify conserved residues and motifs that may have relevance to the function of this protein. vps <dig> is a good choice for evolutionary studies for a number of reasons. first, the coding region is a compact size, with single expressed sequence tag  sequence reads often covering the full coding region, meaning data can be garnered from a large range of species. second, the genomic sequence of vps <dig> in many major eukaryotic groups contain introns, which enables analyses of intron evolution. thirdly, the range of proteins used for eukaryote-wide evolutionary studies have, to date, been quite restricted and included very few trafficking proteins  <cit> . evolutionary analyses of more proteins involved in subcellular trafficking will ensure evolutionary data are more representative. finally, we identify vps <dig> genes in a wide variety of organisms many with known medical, agricultural, and economic importance, which will aid insights into its function in these organisms.

no studies have previously reported on the phylogenetic relationship and evolutionary history of the vps <dig> family. to deduce evolutionary constraints on, and changes in, vps <dig> primary structure, we use comparative genomics methods involving computer programs that line up multiple sequences and look for regions of similarity among them. a family tree of the vps <dig> family was created and evolutionary history examined further by analysing the structure of mapped genes, revealing a highly conserved intron-exon organization. finally, the expression profile of mammalian vps <dig> genes was determined.

our study is of further importance for a number of reasons. first, the mammalian mvb sorting machinery appears overall to be more complex than that of yeast, with the human genome expressing several homologs of several of the yeast escrt components  <cit> . in order to examine the function of mammalian escrt-ii subunits, it is therefore necessary to identify all members of each subunit family, determine how similar they are in both sequence and expression to the yeast proteins, and trace their evolutionary history. for example, if paralogs exist, functionality may not be conserved for each protein. this is particularly relevant for escrt-ii subunits because, by contrast to the endosomal function of yeast escrt-ii  <cit> , mammalian escrt-ii was originally identified as a having a nuclear location  <cit> . this suggests that mammalian vps <dig> homologs  could have a different functionality. secondly, there is a precedent for significant structural reorganization of the vps <dig> escrt-ii subunit through evolution. vps <dig> proteins of higher species lacks the nzf ubiquitin-binding motif found in yeast vps36p  <cit> , and have an alternative ubiquitin-binding motif, glue  <cit> . therefore it is necessary to look for alterations in other escrt-ii subunits, such as vps <dig>  finally, the greater relevance of the recent structural data is entirely dependent on the conservation of crucial residues of vps25p in other vps <dig> family members. our study has determined which residues and motifs are conserved within the vps <dig> family. of great interest is an absolutely conserved lysine residue, which considering the role in escrt-ii in the sorting of ubiquitinated proteins, suggests vps <dig> may be ubiquitinated. our data have further demonstrated that mammalian vps <dig> proteins are true orthologs of yeast vps25p and are therefore predicted to have conserved function. expression profiling of human vps <dig> showed expression in a wide variety of tissue types. overall, these results are consistent with a conserved and fundamental role of vps <dig> in organisms other than yeast.

RESULTS
identification of vps25p orthologs
the vps <dig> gene product of yeast has predicted orthologs in both the rat  and human  genomes  <cit>  and twenty eight correctly annotated orthologs are found listed on the pfam database  <cit>  under accession number pf <dig>  the pf <dig> family consensus is referred to as the duf <dig> domain on the conserved domain database  nomenclature  <cit> . to characterize the vps <dig> family, we used basic local alignment search tool  and keyword searches of a wide range of databases to identify sequences homologous to yeast and human vps <dig>  reciprocal searches using each extracted protein confirmed that all members of the vps <dig> family currently on the database were identified and that no false positives were included. in total  <dig> full length orthologs were identified in a wide range of eukaryotic species  . the species include representatives of all the major eukaryotic groupings, with the exclusion of the rhizaria, for which only a very limited amount of sequence data is currently available. vps <dig> orthologs were absent from the 'completed' genomes of plasmodium falciparum and encephalitozoon cuniculi, although a possible partial homolog may be present in plasmodium species . a further  <dig> partial vps <dig> orthologs were also identified . the coding region of homo sapiens, mus musculus, rattus norvegicus, and bos taurus vps <dig> begins with two atgs separated by a triplet encoding a single amino acid. by comparison to other vps <dig> proteins, the first atg appears most likely to be used. the nucleotide sequence surrounding the first atg is also closer to that of a kozak consensus  <cit> . pairwise blastp e-values indicate the similarity within the vps <dig> family members and were used to compare members of the vps <dig> family . significant pair-wise similarity for a given vps <dig> protein was found always to be limited to a subset of the most closely related sequences, and no vps <dig> ortholog showed significant e-values  when it was compared to all other vps <dig> orthologs. these similarities are best represented in phylogenetic analysis .

eproteins were compared to saccharomyces cerevisiae, homo sapiens, paramecium primaurelia, trypanosoma brucei, dictystelium discoideum, or arabidopsis thaliana vps25p by blastp. the vps <dig> proteins used for comparison were chosen as the representive of fungal, metazoan, chromalveolate, excavate, amoebozoan, or plant species because these sequence are documented on the non-redundant protein database and they are well-known eukaryotic species.

the length, predicted pi and molecular masses of the vps <dig> orthologs were calculated . vps <dig> family members are of similar size and vary in predicted mass from  <dig>  kda  to  <dig>  kda  with an average of  <dig>  kda. the vast majority of proteins  have an acidic pi . the pi of all other orthologs is between  <dig>  and  <dig> , with the striking exceptions of and neurospora crassa and brassica napus with values of  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. it should be noted, however, that predicted pi values do not always correlate with the exact pi values of folded proteins. acidic pis can relate to protein function, and acidic amino acids within vps <dig> may form electrostatic interactions with the positively-charged amino-terminus of binding partner vps <dig>  or mediate interaction with an unknown charged nuclear protein.

overall, the putative orthologs of vps <dig> identified have a similar length, amino acid sequence, pi, and domain structure, compared to the yeast protein. to obtain a consensus sequence for the protein family, conservation of amino acid sequences between members of the vps <dig> family were analysed in detail by alignment using the clustalx program . conservation was approximately equal over the entire alignment . only three amino acids were totally conserved in addition to the initiation methionine, although further amino acids are conserved in the amino- and carboxy-terminal regions of non-protist sequences. these analyses indicate these vps <dig> proteins form a well-conserved eukaryotic protein family.

all three proteins contributing to the formation of escrt-ii in yeast  have two repeats of a winged-helix  domain, despite having no recognizable sequence similarity  <cit> . the wh domain has an h1/b1/h2/h3/b2/b <dig>  topology  and is common in transcription factors  <cit> . we use greek abbreviations in the first wh domain of vps25p  to distinguish it from the second wh domain. the first wh domain of yeast vps25p has additional beta strands between β <dig> and α <dig>  known as β1' and β1"  <cit> , and α <dig> is very short. furthermore, a conserved arginine residue , which forms a salt link with a residue in vps22p  <cit> , is found in a beta hairpin in the unliganded vps25p structure  <cit> . comparison of the amino acid alignment of the vps <dig> family with the known secondary structure of yeast vps25p  indicates that the dual wh domain structure of vps <dig> is likely to be conserved throughout the eukaryota. regions of sequence predicted to be disordered in the yeast vps <dig> structure  <cit>  are regions in which the largest indels are found . arg <dig> is highly, but not absolutely conserved, and is a lysine in a number of species. strikingly, the non-conventional β1' and β1" strands of the first wh domain of vps25p, are only predicted to be conserved in a subset of fungi, predominantly the saccharomycotina . as their presence is atypical of wh domains, our analysis predicts that the wh domains of most vps <dig> proteins will have a more typical wh topology than that of yeast vps25p.

the amino-terminal region of vps25p, before the start of the first wh, contains two proline-rich motifs , prm-i and prm-ii, which have the consensus ppxy in yeast  <cit> . in one of the molecules of vps25p in escrt-ii these mediate interactions with vps22p, and in the other molecule they interact with vps36p. a phenylalanine , immediately prior to prm-ii, lines a hydrophobic pocket of either vps22p or vps36p  <cit>  and is also important for dimerization of unliganded vps25p  <cit> . the second proline of prm- <dig>  and both prolines of prm-ii, make hydrophobic interactions with vps22p and vps36p, and the tyrosine residues are important for this interaction  <cit> . our analysis of the prm region of the vps <dig> family shows the most striking difference is the lack of conservation of prm-i in chromalveolate, diplomonad and kinetoplast sequences , while paramecium primaurelia lacks both prms. while it is the second proline in prm- <dig> that is known to interact with other escrt-ii components, we unexpectedly find the first proline in prm- <dig> is more highly conserved than the second proline. in metazoan species the amino acid corresponding to the second proline of yeast vps25p prm- <dig> is invariably substituted with a tryptophan. the second proline of prm- <dig> is not even well conserved among the fungi, and is present in only  <dig> of the  <dig> fungal regions examined. the residue corresponding to phe <dig>  located between prm-i and prm-ii of yeast vps25p, is highly conserved, and is retained in apicomplexan, diplomonad, and parabasalid sequences. it is conservatively substituted with tyrosine in all plantae, and with another hydrophobic residue in kinetoplast species. it is unexpectedly absent from two basidiomycete species, coprinus cinereus and phanerochete chrysosporium, and dictyostelium discoideum, which also lack the conserved tyrosine of the first prm. a few other fungal species also lack the tyrosine of the first prm.

in contrast to prm-i, prm-ii is highly conserved across the eukaryota. the most striking difference is that rather that the ppxy consensus identified in yeast, we show the consensus for prm-ii is ppxf. this is because the final tyrosine  of yeast vps25p is only conserved in  <dig> of the  <dig> family members aligned. in  <dig> of the  <dig> vps <dig> proteins, this final prm-ii residue is a phenylalanine. in addition, rather than amino acid  <dig> being an arbitrary amino acid, we show this position is also conserved across the vps <dig> family, as is typically a phenylalanine, but a tyrosine in plants. prm- <dig> can therefore be more accurately defined as p-p--. finally, the four amino acids after prm-ii are also highly conserved. these are: an almost absolutely conserved threonine residue and highly conserved leucine residue , followed by the first absolutely conserved amino acid of the vps25p family, a glutamine , and finally there is a further highly conserved proline residue . overall a consensus for the expanded prm-i and prm-ii region, conserved in most vps <dig> family members is: p--x--x--p-p---t-l-q-p.

in addition to the absolutely conserved glutamine residue in the proline-rich amino-terminal domain, mentioned above, there are two further totally conserved residues across the vps <dig> family. these are a tryptophan in the first alpha-helix of wh- <dig>  and a threonine at the end of the first beta-strand in wh- <dig> . the significance of these residues remains to be determined. an additional, potentially exciting, finding from our amino acid alignment of vps <dig> family members is the presence of a conserved lysine residue near the carboxy-terminus . in the yeast vps <dig> structure  <cit> , this lies at the end of a beta-strand . given the role of escrt complexes in sorting ubiquitinated cargo, and the proposed role of ubiquitination in regulating function of other escrt proteins  <cit> , this suggests that vps <dig> proteins may have the ability to be ubiquitinated. ciliate species were the only species lacking a lysine residue in the carboxy-terminal region . entamoeba histolytica and the fungus coprinus cinereus lack a lysine in the conserved consensus, but rather have a lysine as the final amino acid. the highly conserved lysine is typically found in a g-v-k-f motif, with 98% of lysine residues found in a --k- consensus motif. although a consensus for ubiquitination has not been determined  <cit> , it is of interest that this motif is found in a number of proteins involved in ubiquitin cascades. for example: human ring-finger protein- <dig> , two fungal ubiquitin-conjugating e <dig> enzymes  and human deubiquitinating enzymes - <dig>  and - <dig> .

to assess the evolutionary relatedness of the vps <dig> proteins, a phylogenetic tree, based on the alignment of the amino acid sequences of the vps <dig> orthologs  was generated . a distance-based tree was constructed under minimum evolution criteria  <cit> . bootstrap support for branching of many of the more disparate sequences was low. this was attributed to the lack of conservation in key areas, such as prm- <dig> and phe- <dig> . at present, we cannot rule out that at least some of these differences are due to uncharacterized sequence and gene annotation errors. indeed, we have corrected errors in both protein and nucleotide sequences when we have found them, including those in five of the vps <dig> orthologs on the pfam database . this makes an error rate, even on the highly-curated protein databases, of around one in every six sequences. additional figure  <dig>  illustrates our current knowledge of the evolutionary relationship between vps <dig> proteins, and shows homologs from protists, fungi, plants, and metazoans clustering with each other.

intron positions of vps <dig> genes
to examine the evolutionary conservation of the structure of vps <dig> genes, exon-intron mapping was carried out when genomic sequence was available via the genomic databases. in many microbial eukaryotes the vps <dig> gene was encoded by a single exon: giardia lamblia, trichomonas vaginalis, leishmania sp., trypanosoma sp., all the saccharomycotina, some  but not all pezizomycotina, and one basidiomycete . by contrast vps <dig> was found encoded by more than one exon in all metazoan and plant genomes, where data were available. interestingly, introns were also found in the vps <dig> gene of some microbial eukaryotes: apicomplexans theileria annulata and t. parva; ciliate paramecium primaurelia; ameobozoa dictyostelium discoideum and entamoeba histolytica; and many fungi including schizosaccharomyces pombe, some pezizomycotina , some basidiomycetes , and the zygomycete rhizopus oryzae.

the location and phases of intron positions were determined within the above genes  and marked on a multiple sequence alignment . six intron positions have been named 0–v, with intron i being a phase  <dig> intron in all species except for the apicomplexans t. annulata and t. parva, where intron slippage is proposed to have occurred, giving rise to a phase  <dig> intron . intron  <dig> was exclusive to ciliate p. primaurelia. by constrast, introns i–v were found in plants and to varying extents in metazoan species. a common evolutionary origin of vps <dig> genes was substantiated by conservation of introns i–v.

aspecies known to lack introns in vps <dig> genes are listed in additional file  <dig> 

bintron i of the apicomplexan species examined appears to have undergone 'slippage' and is now in phase  <dig>  and is seven nucleotides downstream to all other intron i positions.

chromosomal localization of vps <dig> genes
human vps <dig> localizes to chromosome  <dig>  map position 17q <dig> , mouse vps <dig> localizes to chromosome  <dig>  map position 11d , rat vps <dig> to chromosome  <dig>  map position 10q <dig> , and caenorhabditis elegans vps <dig> to chromosome i . the known chromosomal allocations of all vps <dig> orthologs are listed in additional file  <dig>  further analysis of the chromosomal context of the spliced vps <dig> genes revealed that the human, rat, mouse, dog and cow are found in syntenous regions . these five vps <dig> genes are found downstream to the gene encoding ramp <dig>  and upstream to the prkwnk <dig> gene encoding the wnk <dig> kinase , all in head-to-tail positions on the positive strand. the partial sequence of the vps <dig> ortholog in pan troglodytes on chromosome  <dig> is also in a region syntenic to that of human vps <dig> .

while only part of the genomic sequence corresponding to zebrafish and chicken vps <dig> mrnas are currently known, these sequences localize to chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . our analysis of the surrounding genes  <cit>  indicates synteny between chicken, but not zebrafish vps <dig> regions, and mammalian vps <dig> regions . no synteny was found between the vps <dig> genomic regions of anopheles gambiae, drosophila melanogaster, c. elegans  or plants , and the mammalian vps <dig> regions.

searches of the pfam and nr databases reveal some vps <dig> sequences that were suggestive of longer splice variants of vps <dig>  some involving rna splicing of vps <dig> with portions of the upstream or downstream genes, and others involving alternative start codons . we found no evidence for the expression of longer splice variants of human or mouse vps <dig> . furthermore, these variants are not evolutionarily conserved, together suggesting these are not biologically relevant.

vps <dig> pseudogenes and paralogs
in addition to the excavate species, trichomonas vaginalis which has two vps <dig> paralogs , we identified six vps <dig> pseudogenes . ciliate paramecium primaurelia p-protein, which we identify as a vps <dig> ortholog, has previously been described as having a non-processed pseudogene in a > <dig> kb duplicated genomic region  <cit> . we found no further non-processed pseudogenes.

processed pseudogenes were found exclusively in mammalian genomes , however, no pseudogenes were found in the completed rattus norvegicus or mus musculus genomes.

of the mammalian species, single processed pseudogenes, lacking introns, were found in the genomes of echinops telfairi, homo sapiens , and monodelphis domestica . two processed pseudogenes were found in the pan trogdolytes genome . the nucleotide sequence of mammalian vps <dig> pseudogenes was compared to that of the orthologous vps <dig> sequence  and this enabled us to confirm the pseudogenes were type  <dig> pseudogenes, rather than paralogs, by a number of further criteria  <cit> . confirmation of type  <dig> pseudogenes was due to:  each sharing a high sequence similarity with the corresponding vps <dig> ortholog, with blast e-value of less than 1e- <dig> , considered typical for a pseudogene;  sequence alignment with the vps <dig> ortholog not containing gaps longer than  <dig> bp;  the alignment covers >70% of the coding sequence; and  the sequence contains frame disruptions. the mammalian vps <dig> pseudogenes are retropseudogenes, as they do not contain any introns, indicating they were inserted into the genome by the retrotransposition of the mrna of the vps <dig> ortholog  <cit> . this also means that they are released from selective pressure, which results in the characteristic mutations. for example, the single frameshift error in the h. sapiens pseudogene is located where intron i is found in the vps <dig> ortholog .

in p. troglodytes pseudogene- <dig> , frameshift errors are localized to where intron i and intron v are found in the vps <dig> ortholog . the chromosomal region of p. troglodytes ps- <dig> is similar to the region of chromosome  <dig> where the h. sapiens pseudogene is found, as ps- <dig> is located adjacent to the alpha- <dig> -mannosidase gene, which is next to immune costimulatory protein b7–h <dig> . by contrast, p. troglodytes ps- <dig>  is localized to a region of chromosome 2a with no similarity to the location of the human pseudogene. while ps- <dig> lacks all introns, indicating retrotransposition, it contains no frameshift or stop mutations, suggesting a more recent evolution than that of ps- <dig> 

the parabasalid trichomonas vaginalis is unique as it has two vps <dig> paralogs . both are full-length homologs with no frame-shift mutations or in-frame stop codons . the paralogs differ by  <dig> amino acids, which are found at the amino-terminus of the longer t. vaginalis- <dig> protein. the protein products are 72% similar  and have both predicted secondary structure , and motif, conservation with vps <dig> from other species . for example, the carboxy-terminal lysine and two amino-terminal prms are highly conserved in both paralogs. the phenylalanine immediately preceding prm-ii in yeast vps25p is important for vps <dig> dimerization and partner binding, and is conserved in t. vaginalis paralog- <dig>  however, in paralog- <dig> this residue is a tyrosine. this change probably does not negate function, as a tyrosine substitution is typically found in plant vps <dig> proteins . likewise, non-conservative substitutions were found in a few highly conserved residues outside prm-ii, typically in paralog- <dig>  however, each was found to have a comparable substitution in vps <dig> from another specie . we conclude on the basis of sequence conservation that both paralogs are likely to be functional. nonetheless, we do not know whether both genes are translated and therefore cannot rule out mutations in non-coding sequences, which would indicate one of these is a pseudogene.

expression of mammalian vps25
to determine the levels of expression of human vps <dig> in different cell types, we screened a human multiple tissue cdna panel. a strongly positive pcr product was detected after  <dig> cycles in cdna derived from kidney, liver, pancreas, and placenta, with weaker products resulting from heart and skeletal muscle . after  <dig> cycles, expression of hsvps <dig> mrna was also detected in brain and lung. no smaller splice variants were detected. these results suggest that vps <dig> is a universally expressed gene with a fundamental cellular role.

discussion
vps25p is a component of yeast endosomal sorting complex, escrt-ii, essential for sorting ubiquitinated cargoes into endosomes  <cit> . when we initiated this study pfam curated only eight vps <dig> orthologs, while version  <dig>  now contains  <dig> correctly annotated orthologs. we identified a total of  <dig> full-length orthologs, and a further  <dig> partial sequences, from a wide range of eukaryotic species. vps <dig> orthologs are common to chromalveolates, excavates, amoebozoa, red and green algae, land plants, fungi, nematodes, echinoderms, platyhelminthes, arthropods, urochordata, fish, birds, amphibians, and mammals. while further curation and sequencing of gaps within plasmodium genomes may result in the identification of vps <dig> orthologs, the gene was strikingly absent from the complete microsporidian genome of encephalitozoon cuniculi. microsporidian genomes are strikingly compact, and this is due to a reduction in both gene size and number  <cit> . homologs of genes involved in protein trafficking are the plasma membrane, endosomes, endoplasmic reticulum and golgi apparatus have been identified in e. cuniculi, but these appear restricted to those involved in basic functions. a lack of a vps <dig> ortholog in this obligate intracellular parasite is therefore unsurprising, and is predicted to be one of the genes lost during reductive microsporidian evolution.

the human gene product is a predicted  <dig> amino acid protein with a pi of  <dig> and the human vps <dig> gene localized to chromosome position 17q <dig> , a region syntenous to positions in chimpanzee, mouse, rat, dog, and cow. in addition to synteny between mammalian vps <dig> gene regions, chicken vps <dig> also appeared in a region syntenous to mammalian vps <dig>  however, that of zebrafish vps <dig> did not. extensive conservation of synteny has been found previously between mammals and chicken  <cit> . many regions of synteny are also known to be conserved between the zebrafish and human genomes  <cit> , however our data suggests that this does not include the vps <dig> locus.

the vps <dig> family members identified have a similar length, amino acid sequence, pi, and overall domain structure, supportive of the hypothesis these proteins are orthologous. comparison of the amino acid alignment of the vps <dig> family with the known secondary structure of yeast vps25p, indicates that the dual wh domain structure is likely to be conserved throughout the eukaryota. a common evolutionary origin of the vps <dig> proteins was further confirmed by conservation of many of the intron positions within vps <dig> genes. intron positions were interspersed between the secondary structure domains of the tandem wh domains. introns i–iii localized to the first wh domain; intron i after the two 3/ <dig> helices containing the prms, intron ii after the first alpha helix, and intron iii after the third alpha helix. intron iv and v were localized to the second wh domain, with intron iv near the end of the first helix, and intron v between helix- <dig> and helix- <dig> 

our general knowledge of the patterns of intron gain and loss is still limited  <cit> , but two main theories about the evolutionary origin of introns have been proposed. the first, the introns early  theory, proposes that introns were present in a common ancestor of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, while the introns late  theory proposes that introns arose in the first eukaryotes. one of the earliest pieces of evidence for the ie theory was the finding that several intron positions of the triose phosphate isomerase gene were conserved between vertebrates and plants  <cit> , indicating introns pre-dated the plant-animal divergence. more recently, a large-scale comparison of intron positions among animal, plant, and fungal genes by fedorov and coworkers indicated that around 10% of all animal introns have matches in plant gene homologs and around 7% of animal introns match fungal introns  <cit> , providing further evidence for ancestral introns pre-dating the animal-plant-fungal split and contradicting any theory based on random intron insertion. fedorov and coworkers also found that ancestral introns  were not restricted to phase zero  <cit> .

our analyses of intron positions in vps <dig> orthologs have identified five intron positions  common to animals, plants, and fungi. parallel insertion into 'preferred' sequence sites  <cit> , as expected by the il theory, would be highly unlikely to explain this finding. intron phases in vps <dig> genes were not restricted to phase  <dig>  as intron i was phase  <dig>  and introns ii, ii, and v in phase  <dig>  introns i and ii were also conserved in two chromalveolate  and amoebozoan species , while intron v was conserved in the chromalveolate, paramecium primaurelia. conservation of these introns indicates that they were present in an ancient vps <dig> gene existing before divergence of chromalveolates, amoebozoa, plants, and animals, an event occurring around  <dig> , <dig>  years ago  <cit> . our data therefore provide strong support for the ie theory of intron evolution.

a list of animal and plant gene matches with the highest number of common intron positions has been published, with two genes identified with  <dig> common introns and a further ten genes with 6– <dig> introns in common  <cit> . fifteen genes had five introns in common. all these genes, with high numbers of common intron positions, all had further additional introns unique to either the plant or animal gene. we can now add vps <dig> to the list of genes with high levels of commmon plant/animal introns, and show it is the first such plant/animal gene match to exclusively have only common intron positions.

although we found introns i–v conserved in fungi, no fungal gene had all five introns present, and many fungal vps <dig> genes lack introns completely. nematodes lack intron iv, and arthropods  lack introns iii and iv. of the hexapoda, bee  vps <dig> retains intron ii, while it is absent from fly  vps <dig> genes, suggesting loss of intron ii after fly divergence. vps <dig> from both amoebozoan species examined  was characterized by a lack of introns ii–v , while d. discoideum also lacked intron i, suggesting loss after divergence from e. histolytica. two mechanisms have been proposed for intron loss: reverse transcription and genomic deletion  <cit> . we propose vps <dig> genes lacking any of introns i–v is because of intron loss over evolutionary time. for example, loss of intron ii may have occurred after the divergence of diptera from hymenoptera, as it is present in bee vps <dig>  but not in the two fly species  characterized. our findings therefore support the hypothesis that intronless and near-intronless eukaryotic genes are due to large-scale intron loss.

intron i of theileria species appears to have undergone intron slippage, when compared to the position in amoebozoan, fungal, or metazoan genes, as the intron site falls within the proposed  <dig> bp limit for intron displacement  <cit> . the intron slippage event has also led to a phase change. true intron sliding is rare  <cit> , but this is not the first example of a phase change by a sliding event being accommodated in a functional gene  <cit> . several mechanisms have been proposed for intron sliding  <cit> . however, we cannot rule out an alternative scenario where this altered intron position was caused by an intron loss followed by a gain.

a single convincing instance of intron gain was found in the vps <dig> gene of paramecium primaurelia. p. primaurelia retains ancient intron v, but compared to all other vps <dig> genes, has a novel intron, designated intron  <dig>  and in phase  <dig>  this is the same phase as intron i of other vps <dig> family genes, but is too far from the intron i site to be considered a slipped intron. at present, we lack information to determine whether this novel intron is conserved in vps <dig> genes of other ciliates. to date, our studies of the vps <dig> family have therefore revealed five ancient introns, evidence for intron loss, an example of intron slippage, and a single example of intron gain. conservation of intron positions also is supportive that the proteins we have characterized are orthologous.

the trichomonas vaginalis genome was the only species with evidence for vps <dig> paralogs, and it had two copies of the gene. neither gene contained mutations in the coding region affecting translation, although we cannot rule out non-coding mutations. both genes lacked introns, but as processed pseudogenes have only been observed in metazoans and flowering plants  <cit> , we assume the paralogous gene was formed by duplication rather than reverse transcription. t. vaginalis encodes a large number of rab genes, many of these represent novel subfamilies  <cit> . this indicates trichomonads have a highly complex endomembrane system and provide a precedent for functional retention of additional copies of genes involved in protein trafficking in this species.

while a non-processed pseudogene has previously been reported for the paramecium primaurelia p-protein  <cit> , which we identify here as a vps <dig> ortholog, processed pseudogenes of vps <dig> have not been reported previously. we identify processed pseudogenes in four mammalian species: a single pseudogene in homo sapiens, echinops telfairi, monodelphis domestica, and two in the pan troglodytes genome, ps- <dig> and ps- <dig>  our data supports the hypothesis that the second p. troglodytes pseudogene has only recently evolved. first, while p. troglodytes ps- <dig> is inserted into a similar chromosomal context to the human pseudogene, ps- <dig> is found on a different chromosome in a region with no similarity to that of the human pseudogene. secondly, in contrast to ps- <dig>  ps- <dig> contains no frameshift or stop mutations, suggesting less elapsed evolutionary time. the lack of a corresponding ps- <dig> in the human genome suggests either its loss or its independent evolution after divergence of humans and chimpanzees around  <dig> million years ago. sequencing of further primate genomes will help determine the origin or loss of p. troglodytes ps- <dig>  the lack of a vps <dig> pseudogene in rodent genomes may indicate that the deletion of the pseudogene after divergence from primates around  <dig> million years ago. there is evidence that pseudogene deletions occur more rapidly in mouse, as compared to human  <cit>  and approximately 60% of retropseudogenes in human and mouse genes are lineage specific  <cit> . ongoing mapping of the e. telfairi and m. domestica genomes may assist us in elucidating when the mammalian pseudogenes arose.

yeast vps25p, as well as the other escrt-ii components, share a common tertiary structure, of tandem wh domains  <cit> . wh domains have a h1/b1/h2/h3/b2/b <dig> topology, where the three helices of each of the wh domains assemble beneath a small beta sheet formed by the three antiparallel beta strands. comparison of the amino acid alignment of all vps <dig> family members with the known secondary structure of yeast vps25p reveals that all vps <dig> orthologs are predicted to have a tandem wh structure, suggesting a common structure and function. yeast vps <dig> has additional beta strands between the b <dig> and h <dig> of the first wh domain. these additional strands are not conserved, indicating a more conventional wh- <dig> domain for most vps <dig> proteins.

our comprehensive sequence alignment of the vps <dig> protein family revealed three absolutely conserved amino acids including one glutamine and a tryptophan in the amino-terminal portion. the conserved glutamine residue  was shown experimentally to be important for interaction of vps25p with either vps22p or vps36p  <cit> . by contrast, the role of tryptophan- <dig> remains to be determined. yeast arginine- <dig>  also necessary for vps25p to bind vps22p or vps36p  <cit> , and was found to be highly conserved. also within the amino-terminal region of vps <dig> are two ppxy motifs   <cit> . these motifs are involved in dimerization of unliganded vps25p and interact with vps22p and vps36p  <cit> . motif i was absent in chromalveolate, diplomonad and kinetoplast sequences, and both motifs were absent from paramecium primaurelia vps <dig>  the significance of these absences is not known, but we are currently examining the conservation of other escrt-ii components in these species. of those species with both proline-rich motifs, the general consensus can now be modified to: p--x- for motif i and p-p-- for motif ii.

basic residues potentially implicated in nucleic acid recognition are found at positions arginine- <dig> and lysine- <dig> in the amino-terminal half of yeast vps25p  <cit> . we find these are only moderately conserved. our analysis also reveals two further moderately conserved basic residues in the carboxy-terminal half of vps <dig>  arginine- <dig> and arginine- <dig>  which are exposed on the surface of yeast vps25p  <cit> . any role of these residues for a nuclear role of vps <dig> will need to be examined experimentally in the future. residues in the carboxy-terminal half of yeast vps25p, the region known to be involved in interaction with escrt-iii component vps20p  <cit> , have yet to be examined by mutagenesis or crystallography. wernimont and weissenhorn  <cit>  suggest that tyrosine- <dig>  glutamate- <dig>  and glutamate- <dig>  may be involved in yeast vps20p interaction, due to their accessibility. our analysis shows that glutamate- <dig> is not well conserved and is only present in vps <dig> from  <dig> of  <dig> species. it is surprisingly well-conserved in higher animals, but not in other fungal species, while in plants it is typically an arginine residue. glutamate- <dig> is more highly conserved and is found in vps <dig> of  <dig> of the  <dig> species examined, and of those  <dig> species without glutamate- <dig>   <dig> have conservative substitutions of aspartate residues. those species without highly conserved glutamate- <dig> were: the three alveolate species , the entamoeba e. histolytica, and one plant species . tyrosine- <dig>  like glutamate- <dig> was not conserved in plants, where it was typically a glutamate residue. in non-plant species, however, tyrosine- <dig> was relatively well conserved, being found in  <dig> of  <dig>  vps <dig> sequences. these analyses suggest that plant escrt-ii interactions, particularly, may differ from those of yeast.

we further found a highly conserved lysine residue near the carboxy-terminal end of vps <dig> proteins in short beta-strand  <cit> . in the unliganded yeast vps25p structure, the conserved lysine is surface exposed  <cit> , suggesting a functional rather than structural role. it is found within a conserved g-v-k-f consensus sequence. we suggest, on the basis of:  the previously identified role of ubiquitination in the escrt cascade;  the surface position of the amino acid;  high conservation of the residue; and  the presence of a similar motif in known ubiquitin-binding proteins, that vps <dig> proteins may be ubiquitinated on lysine- <dig> , and we are currently examining experimentally.

vps <dig> was found expressed in a broad number of human tissues with no indication of the use of alternative terminators or alternative splicing. expression of mammalian vps <dig> in a wide range of tissues suggests a generic, but important cellular function. mammalian escrt-ii was originally identified as a having a nuclear role  <cit> , whereas that of yeast has an established endosomal function  <cit> . as we have provided evidence that vps <dig> family members are orthologs, related by speciation events, family members are likely to have conserved function. bu contrast, if multiple human homologs of yeast vps <dig> existed, as occurs for other escrt components  <cit> , functionality may differ for each protein. our data therefore imply that mammalian escrt-ii will additionally have a function in endosomal sorting, analogous to that of yeast. indeed, two recent papers have found that, under certain circumstances at least, mammalian vps <dig> can be found localizing to endosomal structures  <cit> . conversely, our data imply that yeast vps25p may also have a nuclear role, in addition to its well-characterised function in endocytic sorting. supporting this hypothesis, another yeast escrt-ii component, vps36p, is thought to have a nuclear role in regulating mrna synthesis and/or stability  <cit> . interestingly, many other class e vps protein homologs in mammals have also been found in the nucleus as well as the cytosol and endosomal membranes, including tsg <dig>  chmp <dig>  and chmp <dig>   <cit> . further work on the functions of escrt-ii proteins should provide valuable insights into the relationship between the transcriptional regulatory and endosomal trafficking pathways.

CONCLUSIONS
we have identified a large number of vps <dig> family members but suggest that gene loss has occurred in the microsporidian genome. we show that mammalian vps <dig> is orthologous to yeast vps25p and is therefore expected to have an endosomal as well as nuclear function. we detected widespread tissue expression of human vps <dig>  indicating vps <dig> performs pivotal role within eukaryotic cells. synteny was found between vps <dig> chromosomal regions in mammals and chicken, but not mammals and fish. the vps <dig> gene family possesses many evolutionarily conserved intron sites, supportive of an ancestral origin. evidence of intron loss, intron slippage, and intron gain were also identified. retropseudogenes were found in four mammalian species , but were absent from rodent genomes. a recently evolved retropseudogene was identified, which was exclusive to the chimpanzee genome. we have analyzed conserved residues within vps <dig>  which has led us to redefine the consensus of the amino-terminal proline-rich motifs, and to hypothesize that vps <dig> is ubiquitinated. comparison of evolutionarily conserved residues over such a wide number of protein family members provides a valuable resource for studying vps <dig> function in a large number of species.
