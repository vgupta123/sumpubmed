BACKGROUND
amenability to mutagenesis combined with optical transparency of externally developing embryos and large clutch size make zebrafish an excellent model system for developmental genetics  <cit> . two large-scale ethylnitrosourea  mutagenesis screens have clearly established that all aspects of zebrafish development can be analyzed by forward genetics  <cit> . indeed, these large-scale screens continue to be followed up by more specialized screens for defects in specific biological pathways . high efficiency and random nature of chemical mutagenesis enables generation of multiple alleles of variable strength, as recently reported for tbx2b <cit> . constant improvements in both mapping resources and fidelity of the assembly of the zebrafish genome have enabled identification of a significant subset of genes affected by chemically-induced mutations. nonetheless, some chemical mutants of exceptional biological interest remain to be cloned or confirmed. a classic example is the hemangioblast mutant cloche, for which only a candidate gene has been reported to date  <cit> . other examples are still-uncloned cocaine addiction mutants dumbfish, jumpy and goody-two-shoes <cit> . thus, while chemical mutagenesis can readily generate mutants in biological pathways of interest, it does not always lead to molecular identification of the affected genes.

insertional mutagenesis is not as random as chemical mutagenesis and does not possess as high efficiency. however, these deficiencies are offset by more straightforward identification of affected genes using the insertional mutagen as a molecular tag. furthermore, it is possible to use fluorescent reporters to monitor the expression of mutated genes as well as design the insertional mutagen for additional utility. the only insertional mutagen used to date in large scale in zebrafish is the pseudotyped retrovirus. the virus has been used in two complimentary approaches. the first was to mutate genes required for embryonic development, leading to identification of over  <dig> such genes by a single laboratory  <cit> . the second approach was to analyze the regulatory landscape of the zebrafish genome through enhancer trapping  <cit> . albeit successful, retrovirus as an insertional mutagenesis vector has several limitations. first, production and handling of viral particles requires special expertise and facilities. second, modifications such as addition of gene trap components may result in lower virus titers and require significant optimization of production procedures  <cit> . finally, the only retroviral approach that produced fluorescent protein expression-tagged integration events -the enhancer trap- did not produce a significant number of loss-of-function alleles  <cit> .

success of transposon-based mutagenesis in drosophila  prompted investigation of the activity of different transposons – tc <dig>  sleeping beauty and tol2- in the zebrafish  <cit> . in contrast to the retrovirus, transposable elements do not possess the machinery to deliver exogenous dna into the nucleus, which results in somewhat lower rates of integration into the genome and subsequent germline transmission of transposition events. transposon-based insertional mutagenesis vectors used in zebrafish fall under the general categories of enhancer trap, 5’ gene trap and 3’ gene trap, and include fluorescent reporters to detect “trapping” events. enhancer and 5’ gene trap vector integrations reveal the expression profile of the tagged locus and are ideal for the optically transparent, externally developing zebrafish embryos. the drawback of enhancer trap vectors is that they usually are not mutagenic and only induce mutations by integrations into exons or other essential sequences of genes . as expected, transposon-based enhancer trap integrations did not result in overt embryonic phenotypes in zebrafish  <cit> . initial zebrafish gene trap vectors suffered from poor mutagenicity as well  <cit> . two reasons may underlie this lack of mutagenicity. first, the vector used in these studies was later found to also function as an enhancer trap  <cit> . second, when integration did occur into a gene, the splice acceptor and polyadenylation/transcriptional termination sequences were leaky, allowing for read-through transcription and splicing  <cit> . this leakiness may be partly attributed to use of rabbit β-globin splice acceptor   <cit> , as there appear to be significant differences between mammalian and fish splice sites  <cit> . to reduce this read-through transcription and splicing, sivasubbu and colleagues used fish-derived sa and transcriptional termination/polyadenylation ) sequences. integrations into genes were selected using the 3’ gene trap paradigm and enabled identification of the first transposon-induced phenotypic mutation in zebrafish, leading to adaptation of the term “gene breaking transposon”   <cit> . notably, gbts are capable of inducing mutations by integration into introns of genes. this makes gbt-induced mutations reversible by removing the sa/p components.

the next step was to develop a true 5’ gene trap vector by flanking it with a fish-derived and potentially mutagenic sa/p sequences. to make selection for integration into protein-coding genes more stringent, the aug translation initiation codon of the fluorescent reporter was removed. the 5’ gene trap cassette was flanked by loxp sites, leading to generation of first revertible mutants in zebrafish  <cit> . an alternative mutagenesis strategy relying on integration of trap vectors into exons or other important sequences has also been proposed  <cit> . in parallel, gal4-based transcriptional activators were being adapted for insertional mutagenesis  <cit> . the main advantage of gal4-based transcriptional activators is that gene- or enhancer-trap lines can be used as drivers for expression of other transgenes including fluorescent reporters, toxin genes, calcium sensors and optically activated channel proteins, in a tissue-specific manner  <cit> .

in this study, we provide proof-of-principle demonstration that a gene breaking transposon can be equipped with gal4-vp <dig>  resulting in sensitive detection of weak gene expression. genes involved in a variety of cellular functions, from transcription to secretion, were mutated using our gal4-based vector. the modified gene trap is highly mutagenic at molecular and phenotypic levels, resulting in isolation of two embryonic lethal and one post-embryonic lethal mutations which are revertible by cre-mediated recombination.

RESULTS
gene trap vector design and features
our gbt-b <dig>  vector is composed of several components that in concert ensure efficient mutagenesis, evaluation of the trapped gene’s expression profile and enable manipulation of resulting mutant alleles. it is based on the gbt-r <dig> vector   <cit> , with aug-less mrfp  replaced by aug-less gal4-vp <dig>  . for direct detection of gene trap events, gbt-b <dig> vector also contains a uas:egfp cassette  <cit> . in addition, the vector has frt, loxp and i-scei meganuclease sites to facilitate manipulation of insertional alleles. the loxp and i-scei sites, originally present in the parental gbt-r <dig> vector  <cit> , flank gal4-vp <dig> and uas:egfp sequences. the two loxp sites are in direct orientation and therefore permit excision of the gene trap leading to reversion of the mutations, as demonstrated for gbt-r <dig> mutations in gabbr1b and tnnt <dig> genes  <cit> .

in drosophila, p-element integrations can be converted into deletions  by imprecise excision of the transposon  <cit>  . as tol <dig> transposon does not appear to be prone to imprecise excision, we flanked our gene trap cassette with two inverted i-scei meganuclease sites. while i-scei is mainly used to facilitate transgenesis in zebrafish, it is used to study dna repair pathways in other systems  <cit> . we anticipate that double strand breaks induced by i-scei meganuclease may be repaired by error-prone repair mechanisms, leading to generation of local deletions large enough to remove one or more coding exons of the mutated gene.

to test if our gene trap vector containing gal4-vp <dig>  uas:egfp and additional features retained the specificity of gbr-r <dig>  we injected this vector into 1-cell zebrafish embryos with and without tol <dig> transposase mrna. without tol <dig> transposase mrna, there was no expression of egfp . when tol <dig> transposase was included, almost all embryos had gfp-positive cells, with 20-30% expressing gfp quite highly and/or in tissues of different embryonic origin . we concluded that gbt-b <dig> is unable to express egfp unless integrated into the genome, and therefore may have sufficient fidelity to function as a gene trap.

gal4-vp <dig> has been shown to be toxic when overexpressed, and an attenuated version of the activator, gal4-ff, has been shown to activate expression of uas-controlled transgenes in zebrafish  <cit> . we therefore constructed a second gene trap vector, named gbt-b <dig>  which contains gal4-ff in place of gal4-vp <dig>  when injected into zebrafish embryos, gbt-b <dig> produced significantly lower level of egfp expression, suggesting that gal4-ff is a significantly less potent transcriptional activator than gal4-vp <dig> . we screened  <dig> f <dig> fish injected with gbt-b <dig> and failed to recover any gene traps. gal4-ff may be too weak a transcriptional activator to function in the context of a highly stringent gene trap requiring a translational fusion with the n terminus of the protein encoded by the mutated gene.

uas:mrfp tester lines
integration of gbt-b <dig> into an intron of a protein-coding gene in sense orientation is expected to result in a fusion transcript between the 5’ end of the img  mrna and gal4-vp <dig> . if the reading frames of the upstream exon of the img and gal4-vp <dig> match, a fusion protein composed of the n-terminal portion of the protein encoded by img and gal4-vp <dig> will be translated. for a gene trap to be detected, this fusion protein has to enter the nucleus, bind the 14xuas and activate egfp expression. however, egfp expression may also result from an enhancer trap event if the minimal promoter in front of egfp falls under the control of a nearby enhancer . it is critical to distinguish between gene- and enhancer-trap events. gene traps represent integrations into genes that disrupt their expression, while enhancer trap events are unlikely to be integrations into genes and consequently unlikely to result in any loss-of-function phenotypes. to distinguish between these two classes of events, we have generated two 14xuas:mrfp transgenic lines. in case of a bona fide gene trap event, the img-gal4-vp <dig> fusion protein will activate the expression of uas-driven mrfp in trans. in case of an enhancer trap, egfp is produced in the absence of gal4-vp <dig> and uas:mrfp will not be activated.

our first gene trap tester line, tg, was established based on weak leaky expression of mrfp in the nervous system. leaky mrfp expression in the absence of transactivation complicated gene trap screening, and we no longer use this transgenic line. our second uas:mrfp tester line is tgtpl <dig> tpl <dig> for brevity hereafter), marked by a lens-specific gfp cassette from  <cit> . to reduce the possibility of mixing up putative founder or f <dig> gene trap fish with tgtpl <dig> tester fish, we bred tgtpl <dig> onto a homozygous brass background and inject gene traps into fish with wild type pigmentation pattern.

screening strategies
the gene trap vector dna was mixed with tol <dig> transposase mrna and injected into the yolk of 1-cell zebrafish embryos. injected embryos were screened for gfp expression at  <dig> days post fertilization . approximately 30% of embryos with the brightest gfp expression  were selected and raised to establish an f <dig> pool for screening. the pilot gene trap screen was carried out in two stages. in the first stage, the f <dig> fish were incrossed, and all gfp-positive embryos were raised. gfp-positive fish were then crossed to tg or tgtpl <dig> to distinguish between gene trap events  and enhancer trap events . seventy fish were screened and  <dig> gene trap lines were established from this work. we have also discovered at least  <dig> enhancer trap events. enhancer traps were discarded with the exception of ettpl <dig>  which displayed a highly specific vascular expression pattern  <cit> . in the second stage of the screen, gbt-b1-injected f <dig> fish were screened by crossing to the tgtpl <dig> line. we screened two hundred putative f <dig> fish and recovered  <dig> gene trap events from the second stage of the screen. altogether, we screened  <dig> putative f <dig> fish and recovered  <dig> gene trap lines with diverse expression patterns .

identification of insertionally mutated genes 
to estimate the number of integrations present in f <dig> fish, we have performed southern hybridization analysis with an egfp probe on a pool of  <dig> gfp positive and a pool of  <dig> gfp negative embryos from  <dig> different lines. the analysis revealed that the number of transposon insertions varied from  <dig> to  <dig>  among different lines, and in most of them there was only a single integration linked to gfp.

two complementary strategies were used to identify insertionally mutated genes: inverse pcr  and 5’ race. ipcr is the preferred method for mapping imgs as it permits identification of the exact genomic position of the gene trap integration. in contrast, 5’race only identifies the 5’ exon of the trapped gene, but does not reveal the exact genomic position of gene trap integration, which makes it challenging to design genotyping primers.

ipcr analysis led to successful identification of imgs in  <dig> of the lines while for the remaining  <dig> lines ipcr results were inconclusive, yielding either repetitive sequences that have multiple matches in the zebrafish genome, sequences that mapped to short contigs devoid of protein coding genes, or sequences that did not map onto current assembly of the zebrafish genome. in some cases, inverse pcr failed to produce any bands at all. for the majority of candidate imgs  identified by ipcr, the presence of a fusion mrna in gfp-positive but not gfp-negative embryos was also confirmed by conducting rt-pcr with a cimg’s exonic primer upstream of the integration and a reverse gal <dig> primer. fusion mrnas were then sequenced to verify continuity of the reading frame between the upstream img exon and gal4-vp <dig> 

to identify additional imgs, we performed 5’-race on four gene trap lines that failed ipcr mapping: tpl <dig>  tpl <dig>  tpl <dig> and tpl <dig>  similarly to ipcr, 5’ race was performed on rna from batches of  <dig> gfp positive embryos following a published protocol  <cit> . linkage of a given 5’ race product to gfp expression was confirmed by rt-pcr on mrna from batches of  <dig> gfp-positive and gfp-negative embryos collected independently of the 5’race procedure. we successfully identified cimgs in all four lines. for gene trap line nudctpl <dig>  exons upstream of the gene trap integration site are missing from zv <dig> zebrafish genome assembly, which explains why inverse pcr failed to map this integration. in gene trap line zfp36l1atpl <dig>  the transposon integrated into a relatively short  intron. we were able to map the exact position of the gene trap integration by carrying out pcr using exon primers in combination with tol <dig> inverted repeat primers. we were unable to determine the exact position of the gene trap integration in lines nfe2l1tpl <dig> and eef1a1l1tpl <dig> 

altogether, we established  <dig> gene trap lines and successfully identified imgs linked to gfp expression in  <dig> of them . in  <dig> cases, gene trap integration has occurred into an intron following an exon ending in phase  <dig> with respect to the gene’s reading frame. this is the expected scenario, as the reading frame of gal4-vp <dig> in our gene trap vector is in phase  <dig> with respect to the splice site. among the five cases not conforming to this expected scenario, four are integrations into exons. in gene trap lines st6galnac5tpl <dig>  dkey-9i <dig> tpl <dig> and cyp26c1tpl <dig>  the transposon integration occurred into exons immediately following an exon in phase  <dig>  we did not perform rt-pcr on dkey-9i <dig> tpl <dig>  but in gene trap lines st6galnac5tpl <dig> and cyp26c1tpl <dig> rt-pcr yielded fusion transcripts consisting of the upstream exon and gal4-vp <dig>  this occurs if splicing machinery skips the endogenous splice acceptor upstream of the exon into which the gene trap integrated and used the gene trap splice acceptor instead. the fourth gene trap line with an exonic gene trap integration linked to gfp expression is fam46bbtpl <dig>  in this case, the gene trap has integrated into the first exon of the gene, downstream of the atg but  <dig> base pairs upstream of exon/intron boundary. it is likely that another linked gene trap integration we failed to identify may be responsible for the gfp expression pattern. nonetheless, fam46bbtpl <dig> can be considered a null mutant of fam46bb. the fifth non-canonical case of gene trap integration is presented by jam3btpl <dig> line. in this case, gene trap integration into the first intron of jam3b gene is linked to gfp expression, and expression in our gene trap line closely resembles the published expression pattern of jam3b . however, the first exon of jam3b ends in phase  <dig>  which should prevent translation of jam3b-gal4vp <dig> fusion protein. we confirmed this out-of-frame fusion transcript by rt-pcr. we also observed that two gene trap integrations were linked to gfp expression by southern hybridization , indicating that additional integrations on chromosome  <dig> may be responsible for the gene trap expression pattern.

correspondence between expression patterns of insertionally mutated genes and fluorescent reporters
our gene trap screen yielded a variety of expression patterns, ranging from fairly ubiquitous to tissue-specific . expression patterns of uas:egfp in cis and uas:mrfp in trans matched very closely. consistently with published observations  <cit> , egfp expression was quicker to appear in all gene trap lines, but mrfp expression was more robust in later stages of development. expression patterns of many of the mutated genes have been previously described by others, and data has been deposited to zebrafish information network , including not spatially restricted expression patterns noted for nudc , stat <dig>  , eef1a1l <dig>  and lasp <dig> . other expression patterns available through zfin reasonably closely match our observed expression patterns with some notable exceptions. several of the gene traps display pronounced mrfp fluorescence in the yolk , while gene expression in the yolk is not typically observed by in situ hybridization. this may be non-specific, or may reflect accumulation of fluorescent protein from maternal contribution or from earlier gene expression in yolk syncytial layer. a separate subset of gene traps displays mrfp expression in the notochord  at  <dig> dpf. similarly to yolk, notochord is not a prominent expression domain when gene expression at  <dig> dpf is analyzed by in situ hybridization . mrfp expression in the notochord may be a remnant of earlier expression, or may reflect non-specific background. a particularly instructive example is presented by the baiap2l1atpl <dig> gene trap. by in situ hybridization, baiap2l1a is expressed in the periderm and notochord before but not after the 25-somite stage. in 2-day embryo, baiap2l1a is expressed in the pronephric duct, in the general area of the pharynx and in the brain . in contrast, mrfp expression in the skin and the notochord is observed through  <dig> dpf in baiap2l1atpl <dig> gene trap line, in addition to highly pronounced expression in the areas of kidney tubules, pharynx and lower jaw . it has been noted that turnover of mrfp in vivo is very slow  <cit> , which may explain the presence of uas-driven mrfp but not baiap2l1a mrna in the skin and the notochord at  <dig> dpf.

in the nsfatpl <dig> gene trap line, we observed expression of gfp throughout the developing nervous system in a pattern largely consistent to the previously reported expression of nsfa <cit> . however, the gene trap line nsfatpl <dig> also expresses gfp and rfp in the pancreas . to investigate if this pancreatic fluorescent protein expression corresponds to endogenous expression of nsfa, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization using a dig-labeled riboprobe antisense to nsfa. robust in situ hybridization signal in the nervous system was detectable after a short staining period. longer incubation yielded a clear hybridization signal in pancreas as well . this indicates that endogenous nsfa transcript is present in the pancreas. relatively low abundance of nsfa transcript in the pancreas compared to the nervous system explains why it was missed by previous studies in zebrafish. importantly, nsf is known to be expressed in human pancreatic beta-cells  <cit> .

while all of our gal <dig> gene traps can be used as drivers to express other transgenes in tissues expressing mrfp , lines displaying restricted neuronal expression are of particular interest given presence of well-established gal4/uas based tools to modulate and detect neuronal activity  <cit> . we therefore decided to test how closely expression of mrfp in trans corresponds to the endogenous expression of three genes expressed in overlapping but different neuronal domains: ebf <dig>  cyp26c <dig> and snap25b . we found that expression of mrfp largely corresponds to the expression of endogenous gene, but in an incomplete and/or mosaic pattern. incompleteness of mrfp expression compared to the endogenous expression may in part be due to the delay in mrfp fluorescence because of slow maturation of mrfp as well as the additional step of transcriptional activation by gal4-vp <dig>  mosaicism of mrfp expression compared to the expression of endogenous gene is most likely due to partial silencing of gal <dig> uas. thus, while bgt-b <dig> gene traps can be used as highly specific gal <dig> drivers, additional steps should be taken to ensure that the transgene of interest is indeed expressed in the cells that are being targeted.

assessment of mutagenicity at the molecular level
one of the key questions regarding any mutagenesis strategy is the ability to generate complete loss-of-function  alleles. reverse genetic strategies such as tilling, zinc finger nucleases and talen nucleases in zebrafish and homologous recombination in the mouse are designed to ensure physical disruption of exons or splice sites, which greatly increases the probability of complete loss-of-function alleles. generation of loss-of-function alleles by gbts relies on the efficiency of the vectors splice acceptor and transcriptional termination signals in a given genomic context. to assess the mutagenic efficiency of our system, we have performed qrt-pcr to quantify the levels of wild type read-through transcript in  <dig> lines . expression levels were compared between three or four homozygous mutant embryos and three wild type siblings at  <dig> dpf. in four out of six lines, the amount of wild type transcript was below 1%, while one additional line had wild type transcript at almost 4%. in the remaining four lines, the amount of wild type transcript ranged from  <dig> % to 32%.

it should be noted that lines harboring integrations into exons - st6galnac5tpl <dig>  dkey-9i <dig> tpl <dig>  fam46bbtpl <dig> and cyp26c1tpl <dig> - were excluded from this qrt-pcr analysis because wild type transcript cannot be produced in these lines. we also excluded the gene trap line flrtpl <dig>  because it had a severe embryonic phenotype suggestive of a null phenotype . it is difficult to unequivocally interpret levels of tissue-specific specific transcript between wild type embryos and embryos with severe developmental defects.

assessment of mutagenicity at the phenotypic level
to test for overt homozygous phenotypes, we have in-crossed f <dig> or later generation heterozygous siblings from all gene trap mutant lines. embryos were checked for overt phenotypes at  <dig> dpf,  <dig> dpf,  <dig> dpf. two of our gene trap lines are insertional alleles of genes with previously characterized chemically-induced mutations: nsfatpl <dig> and flrtpl <dig>  all incrosses of nsfatpl <dig> heterozygotes resulted in approximately 25% of embryos displaying failure to inflate the swim bladder and a progressive paralysis phenotype consistent with the previously published phenotype of nsfast25and nsfast <dig> <cit>  . pcr genotyping confirmed that all paralyzed embryos with non-inflated swim bladders were homozygous for the nsfatpl <dig> gene trap allele . similarly, all incrosses of flrtpl <dig> heterozygotes resulted in 25% of embryos displaying abnormal body curvature and kidney defects similar to the phenotype of flrm <dig> homozygous mutants  <cit>  .

to test for postembryonic lethality, we raised gfp-positive fish from incrosses of  <dig> additional gene trap lines: nudctpl <dig>  stat <dig> tpl <dig>  st6galnac5tpl <dig>  zfp36l1atpl <dig>  nfe2i1tpl <dig>  atp1a3atpl <dig>  bbs7tpl <dig> and sgip1tpl <dig>  for gene traps that do not affect survival of homozygotes, we expected 1/ <dig> of adult fish to be homozygous and 2/ <dig> fish to be heterozygous for the gene trap. in all but one line  we observed the expected mendelian ratio of homozygous mutants versus heterozygous fish. in the atp1a3atpl <dig> gene trap line, no homozygous mutants were identified after genotyping the initial clutch of  <dig> gfp-positive adult survivors, even though homozygous embryos did not display overt phenotypes at  <dig> dpf . we then followed the survival rate among  <dig> gfp positive embryos from  <dig> different clutches of heterozygous in-cross over a period of one month. we discovered that a severe drop in survival occurred between  <dig> dpf and  <dig> dpf with no further change beyond  <dig> dpf. forty five percent  of larvae survived to one month. we then genotyped adult fish  from two additional clutches and failed to find homozygous mutants among them. together with the initial genotyping data we obtained 0/ <dig> homozygous embryos instead of the expected ratio of approximately 13/ <dig> . this phenotype is consistent with postembryonic lethality observed in atp1a <dig> mutant mice  <cit> .

morpholino  knockdown phenotypes have been published for two mutants recovered in our screen, atp1a3atpl <dig> and bbs7tpl <dig> <cit> . morpholino knockdown of atp1a3a resulted in dilated brain ventricles and electrophysiological defects in rohon-beard neurons, resulting in defective touch response  <cit> . in incrosses of atp1a3atpl <dig> heterozygotes we did not observe embryos with severely dilated  brain ventricles, but we have not assessed them for more subtle defects . we also did not observe severe touch response defects reported in morpholino injected embryos at  <dig> hpf. however, larval lethality of atp1a3atpl <dig> homozygotes clearly supports an essential role for atp1a3a in neural development and/or physiology.

for bbs <dig>  yen and colleagues observed absent or reduced kupffer’s vesicle  in  <dig> % of embryos injected with  <dig> μm solution of morpholino. the percentage of embryos with kv defects was reduced to  <dig> % when  <dig> μm solution of the same morpholino was used, indicating that this phenotype was highly dose-dependent. we did not observe a significant fraction of embryos with kv defects in bbs7tpl <dig> heterozygous incrosses . yen and colleagues also noted that approximately 14% of embryos injected with either  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm solution of bbs <dig> morpholino displayed defects in cardiac jogging: the first morphologically observable indication of left-right patterning  <cit> . in our incrosses of bbs7tpl <dig>  we observed a low percentage  of embryos with heart looping or jogging defects or delay at  <dig> dpf, but a majority of these embryos had normal hearts by  <dig> dpf. notably, embryos homozygous for bbs7tpl <dig> retained over 9% of full-length transcript, and the level of endogenous full-length bbs <dig> transcript varied 14-fold among homozygous embryos while the variation was only 2-fold among wild type controls. furthermore, bbs7tpl <dig> homozygotes are viable and fertile. based on these observations, we believe that bbs7tpl <dig> is a hypomorphic allele. hypomorphic nature of bbs7tpl <dig> allele explains why we did not observe phenotypes nearly as severe as noted for high-dose morpholino knockdown. it has also been suggested that mutations in modifier genes are required for full penetrance of bardet-biedl syndrome  <cit> , making it possible that the observed bbs <dig> mo phenotypes may be specific to the genetic background in which they were observed.

reversion of gene trap mutations by cre recombinase
the internal components of the gbt-b <dig> vector  are flanked by loxp sites in direct orientation, analogously to the arrangement in gbt-r <dig> and gbt-rp <dig>  <cit> . since mutagenic properties of gene breaking transposons are brought about by the splice acceptor and polyadenylation/transcriptional termination signals, removal of these components should lead to reversion of the insertional mutation.

to test the efficacy of gene trap excision by cre recombinase, we crossed nsfatpl <dig> to tgtpl <dig> homozygotes and injected  <dig> pg of in vitro transcribed cre mrna into the yolks of 1-cell embryos. we found that cre recombinase was extremely efficient at excising the gene trap cassette, as evidenced by mosaic and nearly complete loss of both mrfp and egfp expression in cre-injected embryos . we then tested if this cre activity is sufficient to revert mutant phenotypes in injected embryos. we injected  <dig> pg of in vitro transcribed cre mrna into the yolks of 1-cell embryos obtained from incross of gene trap  heterozygotes. for nsfatpl <dig> and flrtpl <dig>  we then prepared dna from individual non-paralyzed  <dig> dpf embryos with inflated swim bladders and performed pcr genotyping for gene trap homozygocity. in both cases, we found 5/ <dig> genotyped embryos to be homozygous for the gene trap .

for atp1a3atpl <dig>  we scored cre-injected embryos for gfp and raised gfp-positive embryos to adulthood. adult fish were genotyped, and 3/ <dig> were found to be homozygous for the reverted atp1a3atpl10r allele , demonstrating efficient reversion of the mutant allele.

removal of uas:egfp by flp recombinase
our gene trapping cassette has a built-in uas:egfp component, which allows instant visualization of the trapped gene’s expression pattern. to increase versatility of our mutant lines, we have flanked uas:egfp sequences by direct frt sites. upon expression of flp recombinase, recombination between the frt sites would result in excision of the uas:egfp reporter without affecting the mutagenic gal4-vp <dig> component. excision of the egfp reporter would make the gfp channel available for utilization in other gfp-reliant transgenic applications. for the proof-of-principle of flp-recombinase functionality, we injected  <dig> pg of in vitro transcribed flp recombinase rna into the yolks of 1-cell embryos heterozygous for the nsfatpl <dig> gene trap and containing tgtpl <dig>  as expected, injection of flp mrna did not lead to reduction of mrfp expression. somewhat surprisingly and in contrast to injection of cre mrna, a majority of the embryos did not display a significant reduction in egfp expression either. only about 10-15% of the embryos displayed significant loss of egfp . embryos with significantly reduced gfp expression were raised to adulthood and six resulting adults were outcrossed to tgtpl <dig>  germline-transmited flp-mediated uas:egfp excision events were scored by complete absence of egfp expression in the presence of mrfp. five out of six outcrossed adults displayed complete loss of egfp expression in the germline . as expected, the flp-deleted allele of nsfatpl <dig> retains the ability to activate tgtpl <dig> in trans, and 50% of embryos display mrfp expression. we conclude that uas:egfp cassette can be readily removed from gbt-b <dig> gene trap lines.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the main principle underlying our insertional mutagenesis system is shared with the recently reported 5’ gene trap vectors gbt-r <dig>  r <dig> and r <dig>  <cit> , which use highly efficient splice acceptor and polya to disrupt endogenous transcripts and mrfp to visualize the mutated gene’s expression pattern. we have expanded the versatility of these gene-breaking transposons by splitting the expression-reporting core into two separate entities. we have replaced mrfp with gal4-vp <dig> in the mutagenic entity of the vector. to report the presence of gal4-vp <dig> we included a gal <dig> uas reporter . the uas:egfp component is removable by flp recombinase for situations where the gfp channel is needed for other purposes such as visualization of another transgene. replacement of mrfp with gal4-vp <dig> serves a dual purpose. first, transcriptional activator property of gal4-vp <dig> amplifies the signal of the trapped gene, enabling visualization of low level img expression. for example, gal4-vp <dig> dependent gfp and rfp expression was observed in the pancreas of the nsfatpl <dig> gene trap line – an organ which was previously not known to express nsfa. second, while mutant lines with no phenotype have rather limited research value, our “non-phenotypic” gene trap lines can be used as gal <dig> drivers for ectopic expression of any uas-controlled transgene of interest. notably, neither epigenetic silencing of uas:egfp nor removal of uas:egfp by flp affect the ability of our gene traps to act as gal <dig> drivers. furthermore, the standard considerations apply when using our gene traps as gal <dig> drivers: the uas:driven transgene may be affected by silencing in some or all tissues, and it may or may not express in any individual cell, as illustrated for mrfp in figure  <dig>  in that sense, our gene traps are not different from previously published gal <dig> enhancer- and enhancer/gene-traps  <cit> . we would like to note that compared to enhancer traps with hsp <dig> minimal promoter, our gene trap does not exhibit background expression in non-specific tissues such as the heart and the muscle.

the use of gal4-vp <dig> as the primary gene trap reporter may also raise some concerns. it has been noted that gal4-vp <dig> can be toxic when expressed at high levels  <cit> . we recovered several lines with very high levels of fluorescent reporter  expression, for example tlp <dig>  tpl <dig> and tpl <dig>  and did not observe overt phenotypes in incrosses of these lines. furthermore, there is a significant difference in how gal4-vp <dig> is expressed between different experiments. our gene traps produce fusion protein under the control of a single-copy endogenous promoter, while other experiments used strong exogenous promoter constructs, potentially in multiple copies. in our gene trap lines gal4-vp <dig> is expressed as a fusion protein with the n terminus of the protein encoded by the endogenous gene, which is not usually the case in other experimental paradigms. together with the observation that gal4-ff is inactive in our gene trap context, our data argues that the strength of gal4-vp <dig> is just right for our gene trap context, and that expression levels our gene traps achieve are unlikely to cause of toxicity.

another potential concern for using gal4-vp <dig> as the primary gene trap reporter is that expression of uas-controlled transgenes are susceptible to variegation and silencing in zebrafish  <cit> . to circumvent this problem, we employ a second reporter, uas:mrfp, to ascertain the presence of the gene trap allele. we also tend to select high expressors when we propagate our gene trap lines. nonetheless, after f <dig> generation, we no longer observe gfp expression in several lines including ebf3tpl <dig> and fnbp1tpl <dig>  despite of loss of gfp expression, these gene trap lines can still be used as gal <dig> drivers, as they successfully transactivate uas:mrfp. replacing the 14xuas with a less repetitive variant such as nruas  <cit>  may be worthwhile if sensitivity for low expression levels can be retained.

the third potential concern for using gal4-vp <dig> as the reporter may be the requirement that img-gal4-vp <dig> fusion proteins must enter the nucleus, bind the dna and activate transcription. this excludes a significant subset of genes as potential targets. for example, gal4-vp <dig> fusions with proteins containing amino-terminal signal peptide would be unable to enter the nucleus. such proteins constitute about a fifth of vertebrate proteomes  <cit> . many other protein domains have been noted to affect protein localization within the cell. we were concerned that use of gal4-vp <dig> as the primary reporter will introduce significant bias in intracellular functions of trapped genes, such that we would mainly target transcription factors and other proteins which primarily function in the nucleus. while the subset of trapped genes presented here is too small to exclude or confirm the possibility of such bias, we note that among the trapped genes, two are components of the snare complex involved in secretory pathway , and two are involved in cilia biogenesis . thus, genes involved in a variety of cellular processes can be mutated using our vector. furthermore, gbt-r <dig> and gbt-rp <dig> are especially suitable for trapping genes coding for secreted proteins  <cit> , making our gal4-vp16-based approach complementary.

it would be possible to expand the repertoire of genes amenable to trapping using gal4-vp <dig>  by using viral p2a/t2a co-translation systems demonstrated to work in zebrafish  <cit> . we do not favor this strategy, since there appears to be a positive side effect of using gal4-vp <dig> as the primary gene trap reporter. among gene trap lines we characterized, six have integrations into intron  <dig>  and two additional lines have integrations into exon  <dig>  which effectively results in fusion transcript with exon  <dig> . gene traps using fluorescent reporters do not appear to have a similar 5’ bias  <cit> . the 5’ bias of our vector is likely brought about by the requirement that img-gal4-vp <dig> fusion protein must enter the nucleus, bind dna and activate transcription of egfp and mrfp under the control of gal <dig> uas. one or more of these functions may be compromised by addition of a large polypeptide with one or more functional domains. as a consequence of this 5’ gene trap bias, a shorter part of the endogenous gene is expressed, which increases the likelihood of null alleles. inclusion of p2a/t2a would eliminate this beneficial bias of gal4-vp <dig> gene traps toward 5’ ends of genes.

efficient mutagenic potential of our vector is observed at both molecular and phenotypic level. among the  <dig> molecularly characterized lines, four are integration into exons and therefore null alleles. almost half the lines analyzed by rt-pcr  display wild type transcript levels below one percent and therefore should be considered null alleles as well. a fifth has wild type transcript level below five percent, making it a possible null mutant, too. the flrtpl <dig> line was not analyzed by rt-pcr due to developmental abnormalities but displays a homozygous phenotype very similar or identical to that of the corresponding chemically-induced null mutant. thus, it is safe to assume that well over 50% of mutants recovered with gbt-b <dig> will be null alleles. how does it compare to other published insertional mutagenesis systems? assessment of mutagenicity of the only insertional mutant used in large scale in zebrafish so far, the pseudotyped retrovirus, demonstrated that 4/ <dig> integrations into intron  <dig> resulted in transcript levels below 5%, while 1/ <dig> integrations immediately upstream transcription start site and 0/ <dig> integrations into other introns produced likely null alleles  <cit> . a more appropriate comparison would be with other transposon-based insertional mutagenesis systems. unfortunately, mutagenicity of most other transposon systems was not systematically assessed at the molecular level  <cit> . recently published flex-based vectors reduced the levels of endogenous transcript to just below 7%  <cit> , which is easily surpassed by our vector. it is also interesting to note that gbt-b <dig> appears to be more mutagenic than the parental vector gbt-r <dig>  <cit> . this may be caused by the addition of the uas:egfp cassette. even though this cassette is in antisense orientation in the trap, the sv <dig> p used to terminate transcription of egfp is bidirectional  <cit> . even though sv <dig> p is not efficient enough to cause mutations on its own  <cit> , it may contribute to reduction in endogenous transcript. furthermore, several potential splice acceptor sites can be identified in the antisense strand of 14xuas:egfp cassette . it is also possible that replacement of ^mrfp with ^gal4-vp <dig> added an exonic splice enhancer or removed an exonic splicing silencer  <cit> , thus improving the efficiency of the short carp β-actin splice acceptor used in both vectors. each of these factors may account for the minor increase in mutagenicity of gbt-b <dig> compared to gbt-r <dig>  however, mutagenicity of gbt-b <dig> is clearly lower than that of gbt-rp <dig>  <cit> . gbt-rp <dig> contains an additional carp β-actin splice acceptor in the 3’ gene trap component of the vector, which may contribute to higher mutagenicity of this vector. gbt-rp <dig> vector also uses a poly  which is derived from ocean pout antifreeze gene and is thought to contain a potential boundary element  <cit> . it would be interesting to test if replacement of zebrafish β-actin p with ocean pout antifreeze p would increase the mutagenicity of our vector to rp <dig> knockdown levels, or if an additional splice site would still be required.

while qpcr provides the precise degree of gene inactivation at the molecular level, the level of disruption needed to achieve a loss-of-function phenotype is likely to be different from gene to gene. loss-of-function chemically-induced mutants have been previously described for two of the genes mutated in our screen, nsfatpl <dig>  flrtpl <dig>  in both cases, the phenotypes of our insertional mutants appear to be indistinguishable from corresponding chemically-induced alleles  <cit> . interestingly, gene trap integrations in these two genes have occurred into the first intron. only 4/ <dig> and 18/ <dig> amino acids are retained by nsfa- and fleer-gal4-vp <dig> fusion proteins, respectively.

our mutagenesis system offers an ability to conditionally revert mutagenic insertions into non-mutagenic ones by cre-recombinase mediated excision of the gal-vp <dig>  sequences. reversion of mutations by injection of cre mrna is very useful in determining causal relationship between gene trap integrations and observed phenotypes. tissue- and/or time-specific reversion of the mutation attained by breeding gene trap mutants to lines expressing creer or creert <dig> in a tissue-specific manner would enable dissection of spatiotemporal requirement of the trapped gene. this functionality gives mutant alleles made with gbt-b <dig> an advantage over alleles made chemically, with various targeted nucleases, or with retrovirus. however, it would be even more beneficial to combine the high mutagenicity of gbt-b <dig>  with the full conditionality offered by two-recombinase inversion systems such as flex, recently adapted for use in zebrafish  <cit> . combination of additional functionality offered by gal4-vp <dig> with high mutagenicity and full conditionality would provide a very powerful tool for dissection of gene function in the zebrafish.
