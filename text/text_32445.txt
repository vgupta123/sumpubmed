BACKGROUND
g protein-coupled receptors  communicate via heterotrimeric g proteins which consist of α-, β- and γ-subunits. according to the α-subunits, g proteins are divided into four classes . half of all known α-subunits belong to the gi-family  <cit> . the need for such a multiplicity of gi family members is not immediately evident. proteins of the gi family interact with a wide variety of gpcrs, presently considered as important drug targets.

in the cns, the concentrations of the gi family subunits gαo and gαi <dig> are extremely high, and their localization in neuropil indicates involvement in neurotransmission or some other crucial functions of neuronal cells  <cit> . in contrast, gαi <dig> has a highly restricted localization in the ventricle-surrounding areas. in the rat brain, gαi <dig> is localized in the subventricular zone, the rostral migratory stream  <cit> , the accessory olfactory bulb  <cit>  and the ependymal cilia  <cit> . such a specific localization implies that gαi <dig> may well subserve physiological function distinct from those of the other gα subunits. moreover, gαi <dig> is also present in motile cilia which have a characteristic 9+ <dig> ultrastructure in different peripheral tissues, such as rat oviduct and trachea  <cit> . this may mean that the gαi <dig> subunit plays a specific, regulatory role in ciliary function. these immunohistochemical findings were further supported by the proteomic analysis which revealed that gαi <dig> is a resident axonemal protein of the human bronchial cilia  <cit> .

it is well known that gαi <dig> can inhibit adenylyl cyclase  and thus decrease intracellular camp concentration  <cit> . further, in vitro studies with gαi2-knockout mice have provided information on the role of gαi <dig> in peripheral tissues, showing gαi <dig> to mediate neurotransmitter-dependent regulation of adenylyl cyclase in adipose tissue  <cit>  and ca2+ channels in heart  <cit> , as well as the signaling of the adp receptor p2y <dig> in platelets  <cit> . gαi <dig> has also been implicated in the differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines  <cit> , as well as in insulin signaling in the periphery  <cit> . additionally, gαi2-knockout studies in vivo have reported defects in the immune response, growth retardation and ulcerative colitis leading to premature death  <cit> . however, apart from a recent study providing evidence that a pertussis toxin-sensitive g protein, assumed to be gαi <dig>  is involved in neural stem cell proliferation in the rat subventricular zone  <cit> , we are not aware of any reports elucidating the role of gαi <dig> in the cns.

in this study, we used in vivo antisense icv administration to clarify the physiological role of gαi <dig> in rat brain, especially in the ependymal cilia. although the morphology of the ciliated epithelium at the interface between the cerebrospinal fluid  and the brain parenchyma has been studied in detail  <cit> , ependymal functions have remained largely unexplored. the highly restricted anatomical localization of gαi <dig> in the ependymal cilia and the subventricular areas  <cit>  makes this subtype a particularly attractive target for specific and temporally controlled knockdown by icv-delivered antisense-oligodeoxynucleotides  without the fear for development of compensatory mechanisms, which were evident in previous studies with gαi <dig> knockout mice  <cit> . our data shows that knockdown of gαi <dig> by specific antisense oligonucleotide caused irreversible, unilateral ventricular dilatation in rat in vivo, and ciliary stasis on cultured rat ependymal cells in vitro. this suggests that gαi <dig> has an essential regulatory role in ciliary function and csf homeostasis.

RESULTS
icv administration of as-odn targeted against gαi <dig> results in ipsilateral ventricular dilatation
we found that the rats receiving  <dig> days of icv as-odn treatment developed unilateral ventricular dilatation that was restricted to the as-odn-receiving lateral ventricle . since the intracranial pressure was not assessed in this study, we call the condition ventricular dilatation instead of hydrocephalus in this text. neither saline nor control oligodeoxynucleotides  infusion evoked a similar effect. this outcome was highly reproducible and it was evident both in young , and in adult  animals. for the rest of these in vivo studies, young animals were used. during the 7-day infusion and observation period, the animals grew normally  and did not show any abnormal signs except for dehydration, which was evident from day  <dig> onwards. no signs of colitis or immunological abnormalities were observed. in order to evaluate the effects of as-odn treatment on behavior, the animals were tested for motor coordination, anxiety, motor activity as well as for pain perception and morphine analgesia. no gross alterations were observed .

magnetic resonance imaging reveals the time-course for ventricular dilatation
the time-course of ventricular dilatation development was examined by high resolution magnetic resonance imaging  in vivo. the status of the ventricular system in all animal groups was assessed by mri both prior to cannula implantation on day  <dig>  and on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> of the icv infusion . ventricular volumes  and wall surface areas  were calculated from consecutive mri images using the cavalieri principle  <cit> . the ipsilateral ventricles of as-odn treated rats dilated dramatically, reaching a plateau on day  <dig>  the volume increase of the ipsilateral ventricle was statistically significant  already on day  <dig>  while the volumes of contralateral, 3rd and 4th ventricles remained constant, equal to that of day  <dig>  similarly, the surface area of the ipsilateral ventricle wall enlarged greatly, being significantly larger  since day  <dig>  while areas of contralateral, 3rd and 4th ventricle showed no significant changes in comparison to day  <dig>  animals in odn and saline control groups exhibited no changes, either in ventricular volume or in ventricular wall surface area. quantitative mri data was used to create a three-dimensional model of as-odn animals' ventricular system as it appeared during the in vivo mri study .

to clarify whether the observed phenomenon was reversible upon cessation of as-odn infusion, we studied the time-response relationship of 2-day icv as-odn treatment followed by a 9-day icv saline infusion. the dilatation of the ventricles reached a new plateau level of ventricular volume and wall surface area after the as-odn treatment was stopped on day  <dig> . the new plateau of volume was 28% lower, while the new plateau of the wall surface area was 23% lower than that of continuous icv as-odn infusion. however, the time needed to reach the new equilibrium  in ventricular volume was equal to that observed with continuous 7-day as-odn icv infusion. following the 2-day as-odn administration, both the volume and the wall surface area in the ipsilateral ventricle were significantly  larger than those of the contralateral ventricle since day  <dig>  these experiments indicate that the as-odn-evoked ventricular dilatation was not reversible during the 11-day observation period.

histology and immunohistochemistry reveal ependymal cell damage and loss of gαi2-immunoreactive ependymal cilia following as-odn treatment
the histological status of lateral ventricles was studied in all animal groups by using hematoxylin-eosin staining. the staining was done for  <dig> animals in each group, and one representative specimen from each treatment group was selected to visualize the general, light microscopic view of the lateral ventricles . while the ependymal cell layer of odn and saline control groups showed a normal, uniform ependymal cell row with numerous cilia, the structure of the ipsilateral ependymal cell layer in as-odn treated animals appeared damaged, irregular and ruptured, with practically no cilia present. additionally, the ipsilateral ventricle of as-odn treated animals showed numerous dying cell populations within the ventricular cavity. evidently, these cell populations originated from the ependymal layer as a result of massive cell damage, which followed the development of irreversible ventricular dilatation and thus, stretching of the layer. in contrast, contralateral ventricles in the as-odn treated animals appeared normal, identical to the ventricles of odn and saline control animals.

the knockdown of gαi <dig> protein in ependymal cells was verified by immunohistochemistry using two different primary antibodies. the first was a previously validated, polyclonal affinity-purified reference antibody  <cit> . the second was a commercial monoclonal antibody , which has not been previously validated for use in immunohistochemistry. we verified the subunit specificity of this antibody by western blotting . gαi <dig> immunolabeling in ependymal cells and cilia by the two primary antibodies was imaged by confocal microscopy . both antibodies showed specific and restricted labeling of gαi <dig> in the ependymal cells and cilia while the other brain areas were immunonegative. despite minor differences, the final outcome was the same with both antibodies. as-odn treated animals showed loss of ependymal cilia and attenuation of gαi <dig> protein, whereas gαi <dig> immunostaining in odn and saline control groups was identical with both antibodies. while the polyclonal antibody  <cit>  interacted solely with ependymal cilia, chemicon's monoclonal antibody specifically recognized cilia and also labeled structures surrounding ependymal cell nucleus. the slight difference between the intracellular immunostaining with these antibodies could be due to their different target regions in the gαi <dig> protein and/or due to potential cross-reactivity of the commercial antibody with additional targets, as evidenced by the presence of additional immunoreactive bands  in the western blots of rat brain homogenates.

western blot analysis shows no alterations in gαi <dig> immunoreactivity in more distal ventricular regions
to examine the extent of the as-odn effect, we determined gαi <dig> levels by semi-quantitative western blotting of selected brain structures in close vicinity to the lateral ventricles. the immunoreactivity of gαi <dig> protein showed no changes between as-odn treated and control animals in motor cortex, striatum and choroid plexi .

ciliary beat frequency measurements on cultured rat ependymal cells revealed ciliary stasis following as-odn treatment
to clarify the effect of as-odn on ependymal cells, we carried out ciliary beat frequency  measurements on cultured rat ependymal cells. as-odn administration resulted in decreased cbf, leading to irreversible ciliary stasis while the control oligo had no such effect . in comparison to direct toxic effect on beating cilia, namely the effect of positive control pneumolysin  <cit> , the effect observed after as-odn administration emerged gradually, after a delay. presumably, this delay reflects the time needed for as-odn to enter the cells and to terminate the synthesis of its target protein gαi <dig>  statistical analysis showed that cbf of as-odn treated cells differed significantly  from cbf in odn and saline control groups.

morphology of cultured ependymal cells treated with as-odn appeared normal at the timepoint when ciliary stasis occurred. however, during the 48-hour observation period the cells gradually started showing decreased viability. in contrast, cells treated with pneumolysin typically died immediately after exposure due to acute inflammation caused.

discussion
in this study we used in vivo as-odn administration in an effort to clarify the physiological role of gαi <dig> in the rat ventricular system. we found that continuous icv-infusion of as-odn targeted against gαi <dig> resulted in irreversible, unilateral ventricular dilatation that was restricted to the as-receiving ventricle. high resolution mri revealed that ventricular dilatation developed within  <dig> days and that the ventricle further dilated until day  <dig>  microscopic analysis revealed ependymal cell damage and loss of ependymal cilia. loss of gαi <dig> in ependymal cells was demonstrated by immunohistochemistry. cbf measurements on cultured ependymal cells indicated that as-odn administration resulted in ciliary stasis. our results indicate that gαi <dig> has an essential and previously unrecognized regulatory role in ciliary function and csf homeostasis.

we used young, 3– <dig> week old male rats but the ventricular dilatation was seen after a 7-day icv as-odn treatment also in adult animals. gαi <dig> protein levels in rat brain have been shown to be high already at birth, and to increase slightly until the age of  <dig> days  <cit> . additionally, previous studies have shown that the structure of the ependymal layer reaches maturity by the age of 1– <dig> weeks, and that cilia are fully developed by the first postnatal week in mice and rabbits  <cit> . thus, the use of young animals instead of adults was justified.

in order to avoid potential toxic effects due to the use of stable, modified oligonucleotides, we chose to use unmodified oligonucleotides which, however, are generally rapidly degraded by rnase h. in preliminary studies, we administered a single icv injection of as-odns with a dose of  <dig> μg , which, however, was without any effect . evidently, csf flow constantly diluted the oligonucleotide concentration in the lateral ventricle below the effective level, and thus, continuous delivery  was required to maintain an effective concentration in the target area. similarly, sirnas have been reported to require continuous delivery to achieve stable effects following icv administration in mice  <cit> .

we found that continuous icv as-odn infusion resulted in unilateral ventricular dilatation that was restricted to the as-odn receiving ventricle. a detailed analysis with high resolution mri revealed a supratentorially restricted enlargement, without any signs of subarachnoidal enlargement indicative of brain atrophy. there were no signs of asymmetry attributable to obstruction in the ventricular system, beyond the ipsilateral ventricle on mri. in as-odn treated animals, neither signs of peripheral abnormalities, apart from dehydration, nor any behavioral changes were observed.

in our study, as-odn penetration into adjacent neural structures was not seen, as the immunoblotting of areas distant from lateral ventricles, such as motor cortex and striatum did not show any significant changes between the animal groups. due to targeting a one cell layer with as-odn, immunoblotting was not an ideal method for studying gαi <dig> knockdown in ependymal cells. not only the quantity of these cells was very limited, especially for the immunoblotting analysis of such a low-abundance protein as gαi <dig>  but the severe damage of this cell layer in as-odn treated animals made it impossible to derive sufficient quantities of these cells for immunoblotting analysis. the interpretation of the results would also have been complicated, as the number of gαi <dig> -rich cilia might have varied between the samples. in order to reliably show gαi <dig> knockdown in each of the animals, we used immunofluorescence on rat brain cryosections, which allowed us to examine the endpoint status of individual ependymal cells and the cilia in their native environment. moreover, this method was highly reproducible and enabled inspection of each of the animals after the treatment. while the as-odn treated animals showed attenuation of gαi <dig> protein and loss of cilia, odn and saline control groups showed identical, positive gαi <dig> immunostaining of ependymal ciliary membrane.

the connection between ciliary beat and csf flow direction has been evident for decades  <cit> . a recent study indicates further that beating of ependymal cilia is also required for concentration gradient formation of csf guidance molecules directing proper migration of neuroblasts  <cit> . with respect to the link between cilia dysfunction and development of ventricular dilatation, it has been clearly demonstrated that ciliary dysfunction results in ventricular dilatation or hydrocephalus. metavanadate, an inhibitor of ciliary movement, has been shown to induce hydrocephalus in rats  <cit> . additionally, several animal models of congenital hydrocephalus have been reported, such as sums/np mice  <cit>  and wic-hyd rats  <cit> , the latter of which have been demonstrated to exhibit immotile ependymal and respiratory cilia  <cit> . both sums/np and wic-hyd animals have a currently unknown genetic defect.

furthermore, several studies have shown that hydrocephalus results from deficiencies in cilia structure components, such as the axonemal proteins mdnah <dig>  <cit>  or spag <dig>  <cit> . similarly, hydrocephalus has been demonstrated to follow deficiencies in proteins involved in ciliogenesis, such as polaris  <cit> , hfh- <dig>  <cit>  and polymerase lambda  <cit> . frequently, animals with cilia related genetic defects have symptoms similar to those of primary ciliary dyskinesia  which occurs in humans. pcd is a condition also including kartagener's syndrome and immotile cilia syndrome, and in addition to hydrocephalus, pcd is characterized by many accompanying symptoms such as sinopulmonary infections, situs inversus and reduced fertility  <cit> . this is evidence of highly conserved mechanisms in cilia motility in different tissues.

several earlier studies have reported hydrocephalus following icv administration of viruses or bacteria  <cit> . hydrocephalus related to local inflammation of motile cilia might result from unspecific ciliary damage and disruption of ependymal cells. however, hydrocephalus can also be induced by bacterial toxins or other inflammatory mediators causing rapid ciliary stasis, as has been shown for mycoplasma pulmonis  <cit> . there is the possibility that inhibition of ependymal cilia  <cit>  and loss of ependymal cells  <cit>  in pneumococcal meningitis may be directly linked with post infection hydrocephalus that is commonly observed in patients after treatment  <cit> .

in addition to our study, there is preliminary evidence suggesting that inactivation of gi family proteins results in ventricular dilatation. namely, mice with icv infection by bordetella pertussis seem to develop hydrocephalus, which becomes apparent 4– <dig> days after the infection  <cit> . evidently, in those early studies, hydrocephalus has developed following the inactivation of gi family proteins by pertussis toxin. moreover, previous studies with cultured hamster tracheal tissues have shown that bordetella pertussis infection results in ciliary stasis  <cit> . the facts that pertussis toxin induces hydrocephalus following interaction with the ependymal cilia, and causes whooping cough following interaction with the respiratory cilia indicate that the gi family proteins play a fundamental role in ciliary function. given that gαi <dig> is the predominant gi protein present in mammalian ependymal cilia, as well as in motile cilia in different peripheral tissues, such as rat oviduct and trachea  <cit> , it may well have a ciliary-specific function. consistent with this reasoning, we clearly showed in this study, that the knockdown of gαi <dig> following as-odn treatment resulted in impaired ciliary function and resulted in unilateral ventricular dilatation in vivo.

in our study, microscopic analyses revealed ependymal cell damage and loss of ependymal cilia following attenuation of gαi <dig> by as-odn. this outcome is in line with previous observations about ependymal injury and cell damage resulting from hydrocephalus. following either acute or chronic hydrocephalus, the observed characteristic ependymal changes are decreased cilia density as well as a discontinuous, stretched and torn ependymal layer  <cit> . in chronic hydrocephalus, also scar formation has been reported  <cit> . it has been shown that irrespective of whether the hydrocephalus results from a virus, a chemical agent or a genetic defect, the ependymal changes following hydrocephalus are the same. firstly, cilia, the most vulnerable structure, are lost, then the microvilli disappear  <cit> , which presumably is due to extensive stretching of the ependymal layer  <cit> . finally, the ependymal cells are destroyed. however, it has been demonstrated that normal cilia are present until hydrocephalus reaches a comparatively late stage  <cit> .

in this study, we also clarified whether the ventricular dilatation was reversible at the earliest point when it was evident  but found that the phenomenon was irreversible. this outcome was expected, as it was known that in mammals, ependymal cells do not regenerate at any age  <cit> . this is largely based on the fact that proliferation markers, such as ki- <dig>  has not been found in the ependyma even in fetal life  <cit> . although a regenerative response of subependymal cells following brain trauma has been reported, the resulting regeneration does not apply to the ependymal layer and furthermore, it may be subsequently overwhelmed by severe degeneration  <cit> . it is noteworthy that ciliary stasis in ependymal cell culture was irreversible as well.

although we showed that the ventricular dilatation observed as an endpoint condition in our study could be explained by ciliary stasis following as-odn treatment, our study can not establish a causal link between the two events in vivo. we cannot totally exclude the fact that ciliary immobility may not have been the only factor in the development of ventricular dilatation. although gαi <dig> appears not to be particularly enriched in the choroid plexus , knockdown of gαi <dig> in this tissue might also have contributed to the disturbed csf homeostasis and ventricular dilatation. this reasoning is relevant in light of previous findings showing that intracellular camp levels positively regulate csf production in the choroid plexus  <cit> . besides this, a recent study suggested that elevated activity of camp pathway might be involved in development of hydrocephalus, as elevated pka and pkc activity was shown to result in ciliary defects and development of hydrocephalus in mice overexpressing pac <dig> receptor  <cit> . further studies will be required to rule out these and the other possible factors, e.g. local inflammation, in the development of ventricular dilatation following as-odn treatment.

interestingly, dehydration, which was highly repeatable in our study after  <dig> days of continuous icv as-odn infusion, was also reported in a study with icv bordetella pertussis infection in mice  <cit> . given the peculiar localization of the circumventricular organs  bordering the 3rd and 4th ventricle, it seems possible that csf might have a role in their neuroendocrine regulatory functions  <cit> . it is clear that as-odns delivered intracerebroventricularly can readily reach cvos and thus, might easily interfere with the signalling pathways regulating body fluid homeostasis. previously, it was demonstrated that in vivo icv administration of an as-odn targeted against the angiotensin at <dig> receptor into 3rd ventricle resulted in thirst attenuation in rats, indicating that icv as-odn treatment can effectively reach cvo cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the aim of this study was to clarify the physiological role of gαi <dig> in the ependymal cilia by silencing its function by in vivo icv antisense oligodeoxynucleotide  administration. our results show that as-odn knockdown of gαi <dig> resulted in irreversible, unilateral ventricular dilatation in rat in vivo, and ciliary stasis on cultured rat ependymal cells in vitro, raising the possibility that ciliary stasis resulted in ventricular dilatation in vivo. collectively these findings indicate that gαi <dig> has a hitherto unrecognized physiological role in the regulation of ependymal ciliary function and csf homeostasis in the ventricular cavity. to the best of our knowledge, this is a novel finding and therefore may have immediate relevance to the neuroscience community.
