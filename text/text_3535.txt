BACKGROUND
s. pneumoniae infections remain the major cause of pneumonia, meningitis and otitis in many countries, and a growing number of isolates appear to be resistant to penicillin. purulent meningitis due to s. pneumoniae was recognized more than twenty years ago to be a serious problem in african countries  <cit>  and is known to occur in a seasonal pattern in sub-saharan africa  <cit> . serotype  <dig> is one of the most common pneumococcal serotypes associated with disease, although its prevalence varies among countries  <cit> .

apart from serotyping based on the variations of the coat exopolysaccharides, different dna-based methods utilize genetic polymorphism. macrorestriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis   <cit> , and multiple loci sequence typing   <cit>  are the most frequently used genotyping techniques. an mlst typing system was described by enright et al.  <cit>  together with an online identification page. the rep-pcr or box pcr assay was described in  <dig> by van belkum  <cit> . the different techniques have been compared in several studies  <cit> . other methods use the sequencing of pcr product such as the gal u gene  <cit> , or the pcr restriction profile of the cpsa-cpsb genes  <cit> .

although some of these techniques have proven their capacity to discriminate efficiently among the multiple serotypes, the data are not always reproducible between different laboratories, some may not be amenable to the making of international databases, or they are time consuming and expensive. polymorphic tandem repeat sequences also called variable number of tandem repeats  are an interesting class of genetic markers. multiple alleles may be present at a single locus, and size differences are easily resolved by electrophoresis of pcr products. tandem repeat typing has proved to be highly appropriate for the typing of pathogenic bacterial species  <cit> , including species with a very high genetic homogeneity such as the mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, bacillus anthracis, and yersinia pestis  <cit> .

the availability of genome sequence data from different s. pneumoniae strains greatly facilitates the search for polymorphic dna sequences  <cit> . in this report, we have evaluated the polymorphism of selected tandem repeats, and measured their discrimination power, across a diverse collection of strains.

RESULTS
selection of vntrs for mlva typing
at the onset of this study the genome sequences of two strains, r <dig> and tigr <dig> were available. comparison of these genome sequences using the approach described by denoeud et al.  <cit> , identified  <dig> tandem repeats with a repeat unit equal or larger than  <dig> bp and predicted to display size polymorphism. preliminary sequence for two additional genomes  was subsequently made available and was used to select primers for pcr amplification that would match with all four strains. to confirm that the selected markers were indeed polymorphic, a first set of eight isolates including the reference strain r <dig> and rp <dig> to rp <dig>  were analyzed . eighteen vntrs were retained to investigate a larger collection,  <dig> of which with a  <dig> bp repeat belong to the box family of repeated elements  <cit>  . spneu <dig>  a  <dig> bp repeats, encodes the choline-binding domain of pneumococcal protein a encoded by pcpa  <cit> . spneu <dig>  a  <dig> bp boxb repeat is fused in strain r <dig> to gene trza encoding the n-ethylammeline chlorohydrolase a atz/trz family protein. the sequence diversity within the repeat units of the  <dig> vntrs was calculated using the tandem repeat finder software  <cit> , and is indicated as percent matches .

typing of the reference strain collection
a larger collection of  <dig> isolates comprising isolates from different origins and with a variety of serotypes was then genotyped . as a control, strain r <dig> was systematically analysed with each set of  <dig> isolates  <cit> . the primers listed in table  <dig> were used essentially as previously described  <cit> . the vntrs were amplified very efficiently in most of the isolates. for a few isolates, no amplification was obtained with spneu <dig> and spneu <dig>  the size variations of the amplicons were as expected for an exact multiple of repeats except in a few cases. with marker spneu <dig>  an amplicon of intermediate size was observed, marked " <dig> ", with strain r <dig> , and for spneu <dig> rp <dig> had a " <dig> " intermediate size allele. with marker spneu <dig>  amplification of rp <dig> and rp <dig>  produced a  <dig>  kb amplicon . when examining this locus in the different sequenced genomes we found that sanger strain 23f had an insertion sequence  inserted in front of the spneu <dig> tandem repeat between the pcr primers. similarly, for spneu <dig>  pcr amplification of two isolates, rp <dig>  and rp <dig> , produced a  <dig>  kb amplicon , suggesting the presence of an is element in the repeat. for spneu  <dig> and spneu  <dig>  alleles coded " <dig> " correspond to the absence of a vntr unit although a pcr product is observed.

spneu <dig> has a peculiar configuration in strain r <dig>  in this strain  <dig> repeated elements are observed, a  <dig> bp repeat with low internal homogeneity inserted inside the usual  <dig> bp repeat.

the putative mlva profiles of  <dig> fully or partially sequenced genomes were determined and used in the clustering analysis shown in figure  <dig>  the data for spneu <dig> and spneu <dig> were not used for this clustering because of the existence of null alleles in some isolates as mentioned. combining the  <dig> isolates of this study  plus the  <dig> sequenced strains,  <dig> genotypes are observed. the global hunter gaston diversity index  for the described mlva assay is  <dig> . the hgdi for each vntr marker is shown in table  <dig> 

the remarkable similarity between independent isolates with the same serotype strongly suggests that these markers, with the exception of spneu  <dig>  do not vary at a high frequency. this is confirmed by the fact that the size of the  <dig> vntr alleles was the same in two independent r <dig> isolates, and corresponded exactly to those of the sequenced genome.

to assess the reproducibility of the assay, a series of  <dig> isolates, rp <dig> to rp <dig>  were genotyped in duplicate, in orsay and bordeaux, giving the same fingerprint. the allele size assignment was performed by eye in one site and using the bionumerics tools in the other site.

analysis of two small epidemic groups
part of the isolates in this study correspond to an epidemic situation. they were isolated in the same geographic area in burkina faso during outbreaks of meningitis in year 2002– <dig> and  <dig>  in 2002– <dig>   <dig> out of  <dig> isolates were of serotype  <dig> and one was of serotype 25f. the eight serotype  <dig> isolates from 2002– <dig> have identical alleles at all markers except spneu <dig>  interestingly, for this marker  <dig> different alleles are observed, all corresponding to a large number of repeats . in  <dig>  isolates of  <dig> different serotypes were obtained, three serotype  <dig>  three serotype  <dig>  three serotype  <dig> and two serotype  <dig> isolates. the serotype of rp <dig> and rp <dig> could not be determined. all these isolates cluster according to their serotype. the three serotype  <dig> isolates are identical except for marker spneu <dig>  although clearly distinct, they are grouped with the serotype  <dig> strains isolated in 2002– <dig> .

discussion
a collection of  <dig> vntr markers which can be used to genotype s. pneumoniae strains by simple pcr and agarose gel electrophoresis has been identified. two of these markers, spneu <dig> and spneu <dig>  belonging respectively to pcpa and trza, were not kept in the clustering analysis because they were absent from some isolates, although they might be useful in specific situations. spneu <dig> is not amplified in isolates of serotype  <dig> and 6a suggesting that they lack pcpa. it was proposed that the protein encoded by pcpa could be a surface protein involved in cell adhesion with specific proteins of the human extracellular matrix. pcpa is not essential for bacterial growth at least under laboratory conditions as the gene can be knocked-out with no noticeable change in the pneumococcal phenotype  <cit> . however the polymorphism observed at the choline binding domain might play a role during infection. the effect of spneu <dig> polymorphism on trza is not clear as the  <dig> bp repeat is apparently not fused to this gene in the tigr <dig> genome.

among the  <dig> selected markers,  <dig> consist in  <dig> to  <dig> bp repeats with a regular variation and which amplify very efficiently. the size polymorphism can be scored by eye. two additional markers of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp repeats are also described. in the present study, vntrs with smaller repeat units, of the microsatellite category  were not investigated. due to their sometimes relatively high mutation rate, they may improve the mlva resolution to investigate local outbreaks.

most of the vntrs correspond to the intergenic  <dig> bp boxb repeat. they belong to a family of elements, present in multiple loci in the s. pneumoniae genome, and composed of three subunits boxa, boxb and boxc. subunit boxb,  <dig> bp long, can be tandemly repeated with a high internal sequence similarity  <cit> . these sequences have been suggested to be regulatory elements shared by coordinately regulated genes. the subunit boxb is the only one that can be tandemly repeated.

the polymorphism of these elements has been used to genotype strains in the box-pcr assay. however this assay produces an image  of the added polymorphism of multiple box elements whereas the vntr assay analyses each locus separately. as a result, the mlva assay is more informative and reproducible, data interpretation is much easier, and genotyping databases can be easily produced  <cit> .

we performed an mlva analysis on a collection of isolates originating from africa and france. clustering was observed both on the basis of serotype and geographical origin although there are some exceptions. analysis of the sequenced genomes have shown the existence of many gene transfer events which could explain why strains with the same serotype do not always cluster. conversely, mlva aggregates a number of strains of serotypes which are known to be close variants, such as serotype 19f and 23f  <cit> , and serotype  <dig> and 9v  <cit> .

all the african serotype  <dig> isolates are grouped . interestingly a cluster of  <dig> isolates rp <dig>  rp <dig> and rp <dig> isolated in  <dig> and differing by only one marker, are linked to a second cluster of  <dig> isolates recovered in 2002– <dig> from which they differ at  <dig> out of  <dig> markers. this is a large distance suggesting that the existing population of strains able to cause outbreaks is very diverse. a second lineage contains serotype  <dig> and serotype  <dig> strains differing at  <dig> out of  <dig> markers.

serotype  <dig> strains seem to have a propensity to cause meningitis in burkina faso, as two related clones of this serotype were found in 50% of the analyzed cases. a similar observation was made in northern ghana  <cit> . in contrast to the majority of other serotypes, nasopharyngeal carriage of serotype  <dig> is exceptionally observed. this could be linked to 1) a lesser genetic diversity as compared to other serotypes, due to limited exchanges with other streptococci during colonization, 2) a high invasive potential or 3) high attack rates, as supported by the observations of leimkugel et al.  <cit> . for serotypes other than serotype  <dig>  distribution across the dendrogram may be associated with the nasopharynx carriage .

CONCLUSIONS
this preliminary investigation validates a first set of markers for mlva investigation. the lethality linked to pneumococcal meningitis is high and an appropriate vaccination is necessary, requiring the identification of virulent lineages. the usefulness of the mlva typing scheme proposed here can now be further determined by investigating a larger population of isolates from africa which are currently being collected.

however in a species with  <dig> different genotypes, additional studies will clearly be needed. in particular, it will be useful to see how mlva compares with mlst  <cit> . in contrast with mlst, the relatively low cost and moderate expertise required for mlva typing would allow the systematic typing of any new isolate directly by clinical laboratories within hospitals. all markers proposed here are easy to type with no sophisticated equipment and software, so that it should in principle be feasible to organize networks of clinical laboratories, each one taking in charge the typing of local isolates. to facilitate such projects, shared internet resources enabling the import and analysis of results could be also set-up  <cit> . eventually comparison of isolates on such a large scale will provide a precise measure of the stability of each marker, necessary for the optimized interpretation of mlva typing data.
