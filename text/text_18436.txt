BACKGROUND
multicellular organisms have evolve powerful controlling mechanisms to cope with diverse perturbations in order to assure phenotypically quasi-invariant developmental outcome  <cit> . however, development can be influenced by environmental stimuli, e.g., temperature, nutrients and oxygen availability, and the presence of predators or parasites. the exposure to stresses during development can be deleterious or beneficial to the adults. for example, changes during development influence adulthood disease propensity in humans  <cit> . the adult caenorhabditis elegans that transiently passed through the stress-induced dauer larval stage exhibit an extended lifespan compared to animals with normal development  <cit> . environmental conditions, i.e., temperature, and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentrations  <cit> , were shown to direct the development of nematode strongyloides ratti to distinct parasitic or free-living adults whose aging rates can differ by 30-fold  <cit> . biotic factors can also induce dramatic developmental alterations. for example, in response to waterborne cues from predators, some daphnia species grow protective helmets  <cit> . microorganisms, which are a major environmental component, also have an important impact on development. the effect of microorganisms on development was established by comparing axenic animals against animals colonized with microbes. in fruit fly and zebrafish, axenic development can result in slower development, reduced fecundity, and/or early death  <cit> . axenic c. elegans have a slower development, reduced fecundity, and increased lifespan  <cit> . in mammals, microorganisms can affect the maturation of the mucosal immune system  <cit> , modulate the proliferation and the differentiation of intestinal epithelia  <cit> , regulate angiogenesis  <cit> , and play a key role in the extraction and the processing of nutrients  <cit> .

microorganisms are classified as commensals when they are innocuous and/or beneficial for the host, and pathogens when they are harmful to the host  <cit> . it should be noted that pathogens most frequently do not kill their hosts, but decrease host fitness and increase host susceptibility to environmental challenges. adult hosts mount different responses to various types of microorganisms, which have a profound effect on the hosts themselves. while it is clear that presence or absence of microorganisms can have an important impact on development, how exposure to different types of microorganism, i.e. innocuous and pathogenic, during development affects adult animals health, stress resistance and longevity is unknown. thus, in this study we examined the consequences of exposure of c. elegans nematodes during development to different bacterial strains. c. elegans was chosen because it is a well-studied animal model for aging, development, and host-pathogen interactions, and isogenic populations can be generated and maintained. the bacterium escherichia coli was chosen because it is a well-studied model organism and a species with a wide virulence spectrum, ranging from innocuous to highly pathogenic in diverse hosts. it is also of particular importance that the standard laboratory food for c. elegans is one e. coli strain, op <dig>  <cit> . survival/longevity of nematodes fed with op <dig> is considered as the baseline for all c. elegans studies. e. coli strains are among the first colonizers of the intestinal tract of newborn warm-blooded animals. e. coli strains are mainly harmless commensals, but some strains are able to cause intestinal and extra-intestinal diseases, which by their frequency and potential severity cause considerable morbidity and significant health-care costs  <cit> . we previously demonstrated that e. coli pathogenic strains can significantly reduce the lifespan of the adult c. elegans <cit> , and that e. coli pathogenicity factors are responsible for the observed lifespan reduction.

for this study, c. elegans nematodes were fed on different bacterial strains during development and then with the same or different bacteria as adults. we found that nematodes developed on a pathogen lived longer when exposed to pathogens as adults than nematodes that were developed on an innocuous strain. some of the findings observed with the pathogenic e. coli were confirmed using a second pathogen, a gram-positive enterococcus faecalis. the observed increase in nematode lifespans is controlled by the dbl- <dig> transforming growth factor beta-like, daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like signaling, and partially by the pmk- <dig> p <dig> map kinase pathways. developmental exposure to one pathogen increases resistance of adult nematodes to the same and other pathogens, as well as to heat shock. hence, development on pathogens has a hormetic effect on adult nematodes. hormesis is a response of organisms to low doses of a damaging environmental factor resulting in resistance to higher doses of the same, but also to other stressful environmental factors  <cit> . the possible consequences of the observed hormetic effect in natural environments are also discussed.

RESULTS
for this study, we used the reference op <dig> and pathogenic  <dig> e. coli strains, as well as enterococcus faecalis og1rf strain. the innocuity of the op <dig> strain was attested by observation that the mean lifespan of the c. elegans fer- <dig> nematodes was the same on the live and uv-killed op <dig> bacteria  <cit> . fer- <dig> is a derivative of the c. elegans n <dig> strain, which we used in the present study. strain  <dig> is an uropathogenic e. coli isolated from a patient with acute pyelonephritis  <cit> . pathogenicity of the  <dig> strain was previously demonstrated in the mice sepsis model and in c. elegans <cit> . adult fer- <dig> nematodes exposed to strain  <dig> have a 50% shorter mean lifespan compared to nematodes exposed to the op <dig> strain  <cit> . deletion of pathogenicity islands ii and iii significantly reduces the pathogenicity of strain  <dig> in c. elegans fer- <dig> <cit> , while it does not reduce the bacterial growth rates nor resistance to biologically relevant stressors  <cit> . this shows that strain  <dig> reduces c. elegans lifespan because of its pathogenicity factors and not because it does not provide an adequate food source.

n <dig> nematodes were developed on one bacterial strain and late l <dig> stage nematodes were subsequently maintained on the same strain or transferred to a different one. for this reason, the designation of each experimental condition contains:  the name of the strain on which larvae were developed and  the name of the strain to which adult nematodes were exposed. for example, op50/ <dig> indicates that nematodes were developed on op <dig> and then transferred onto strain  <dig>  all experiments were performed at 25°c.

lifespan of nematode populations developed on different bacterial strains
first, we compared the developmental success, defined as the fraction of nematodes reaching adulthood from an initial number of eggs, for c. elegans fed either on the op <dig> or on the pathogenic  <dig> strain. we observed no significant difference  in the fraction of nematodes that reached adulthood between these two experimental conditions . therefore, it can be concluded that nematode development is robust and that larvae survival is not affected by the pathogen.

second, we investigated the lifespan of adult nematodes on the innocuous op <dig> strain after they were developed on op <dig> or on the pathogenic  <dig> strain. for these experiments, we eliminated bacteria from the l <dig> nematodes by antibiotic treatment and then transferred them on op <dig> strain. no difference , p =  <dig> ) in lifespan was observed between op50/op <dig> and 536/op <dig> nematodes . these results suggest that development on pathogens produce healthy adult nematodes that, when exposed to non-stressful conditions, have identical lifespan to that of nematodes exposed to the innocuous bacterial strain throughout life.

third, we investigated the lifespan of adult nematodes on the pathogenic  <dig> strain after they were developed on op <dig> or on the  <dig> strain. as shown in figure 1b, the exposure of nematodes to the pathogen during development increased median lifespan  by 50% . the increase of survival was also significant during the reproductive period  . the beneficial effect of developmental exposure to pathogen on the adult nematodes’ lifespan was also observed with gram-positive enterococcus faecalis og1rf strain, i.e., og1rf/og1rf nematodes had significantly increased  median lifespan compared to op50/og1rf nematodes .

observed lifespan extension for nematodes developed and maintained through adulthood on pathogens could be explained by adaptation to a particular type of stress encountered during development, which renders adult nematodes more resistant to the same stress, i.e., exposure to the pathogenic  <dig> strain. in order to verify this possibility, we developed nematodes on e. coli  <dig> strain, eliminated the bacteria from the l <dig> nematodes by antibiotic treatment and transferred them on the e. faecalis og1rf strain. development on e. coli  <dig> strain significantly  increased lifespan of adults exposed to the e. faecalis og1rf strain  to the same extent as development on og1rf itself did . these results show that the beneficial effect of developmental exposure to pathogens on nematode lifespan was not due to adaptation to one particular type of strain or stress, but also provides protection against other bacterial strains. developmental exposure to gram-positive and -negative bacterial strains has a cross protective effect, indicating that the recognition of membrane lipopolysaccharides, which are present at the surface of gram-negative but not of the gram-positive bacteria, is not involved in this phenomenon.

c. elegans signaling pathways involved in lifespan extension following development on pathogens
we examined the role of different immune signaling pathways in the nematode lifespan extension following development on pathogens. we first evaluated if two signaling pathways implicated in c. elegans development and in adult immunity are involved in the observed development-induced modulation of the adult lifespan: the daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like pathway  <cit>  and the dbl- <dig> transforming growth factor ß-like  pathway  <cit> . these two signaling pathways function from the first larval stages of nematode development, are involved in the signaling and regulation of the immune response to pathogens and in stress responses to environmental factors in adults  <cit> . when daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like or tgfß-like pathways were inactivated, there were no significant lifespan differences between adult populations exposed to the pathogen after development on op <dig> or on  <dig> . we also tested the implication of another innate immunity pathway, the p <dig> map kinase pathway via the pmk- <dig> mutant  <cit> . the difference in lifespan of the pmk- <dig> nematodes between op50/ <dig> and 536/ <dig> conditions was reduced, but still significantly different . the mean lifespan of pmk- <dig> nematodes was 25% shorter compared to the two other innate immunity pathways mutants, which indicates that the lack of differential survival of daf- <dig> and dbl- <dig> mutants was not due to the saturation of our assay with maximal killing. thus, it can be concluded that the observed reduction of the mortality of adult n <dig> nematodes  is mainly modulated by the daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like pathway and tgfß-like pathway. therefore, the observed modulation of adult nematodes lifespan by developmental exposure to pathogens is likely a genetically controlled nematode response. 

c. elegans resistance to heat shock following development on pathogens
induction of the heat shock response in c. elegans limits the accumulation of damaged proteins, increases stress resistance, resistance to pathogens, and lifespan  <cit> . it was also reported that the capacity to induce the heat shock response early in life correlates positively with the nematode life expectancy  <cit> . for these reasons, we tested whether development on pathogens  increases the capacity of adult nematodes to resist heat shock, and  if it results in the induction of the heat shock response.

first, we found that nematodes developed on pathogens resist significantly  better than nematodes developed on op <dig> to a 10 h heat shock at 35°c . second, we measured the induction of the heat shock response in these two groups of nematodes. for this, we used a c. elegans strain carrying a fusion of a gene coding for the green fluorescent protein  with the hsp- <dig>  gene promoter. the expression of hsp- <dig>  gene, which codes for a chaperon, is regulated by the heat shock factor  <dig>  and daf- <dig>  we observed that development on the  <dig> strain, compared to development on op <dig>  induced a significant  upregulation of hsp- <dig>  expression in l <dig> nematodes . the observed difference was also highly significant , p <  <dig> ) in 2-day old nematodes . the difference in hsp- <dig>  induction cannot be explained by the amount of live bacteria in the intestinal tract, as there was no significant difference in the number of live bacteria in the intestine of 2-day old nematodes exposed to the  <dig> strain whether they were developed on op <dig> or  <dig> . therefore, the induction of hsp- <dig>  depends on developmental and adulthood conditions, and correlates with the resistance to heath shock and the lifespan extension of adult nematodes exposed to pathogens, relative to the nematodes developed on the op <dig> strain.

discussion
we showed that the development of nematodes on bacterial pathogens increases the lifespan of adult nematodes exposed to the same or different pathogens, and increases resistance of nematodes to heat shock. it is important to note that such increased robustness of nematodes developed on pathogens is not due to the culling of weak individuals from the population, as the same fraction of nematode larvae reached adulthood following development on pathogenic and innocuous strains. in addition, there was no difference in the lifespan of adult nematodes on the innocuous op <dig> strain after they developed on op <dig> or on the pathogenic  <dig> strain, which indicates that development on a pathogen does not damage larvae.

hosts can defend themselves from pathogens using a variety of strategies  <cit> . the avoidance strategy minimizes the risk of infection with pathogen and economizes the nematode’s resources, which otherwise would be used for the activation of its defenses  <cit> . the avoidance strategy requires that host first detects pathogens. in nature, c. elegans is predominantly found in decaying organic matter where it feeds on microorganisms, which can be good or harmful food  <cit> . c. elegans possesses a complex chemosensory neuronal system that allows discrimination between these two groups of microorganisms based on the detection of a number of volatile odorant and water-soluble compounds  <cit> . for example, nematodes are repulsed by a cyclic lipodepsipentapeptide produced by serratia marcescens, a bacterium that is harmful to nematodes  <cit> . c. elegans also has the capacity to identify pathogens and harmful xenobiotics by monitoring its essential cellular activities, such as protein translation or oxidative respiration. perturbations of these functions induce aversion behavior and defense mechanisms  <cit> . we did not study the molecular basis of the discrimination between different bacterial strains by nematodes. however, the fact that the observed hormetic effect is not bacterial species specific suggests that it is more likely induced by the nematode surveillance of its own essential cellular functions, rather than by recognition of the specific compounds produced by bacteria.

nematodes also have a capacity to memorize, into adulthood, environmental cues encountered during early life  <cit> . can avoidance behavior based on memory of past conditions contribute to the longer lifespan of nematodes developed on a pathogen and exposed to the same pathogen as adults, compared to nematodes developed on an innocuous strain and exposed to pathogens as adults? this is probably not the case in our study because independently of the developmental conditions, nematodes have the same amount of the  <dig> pathogenic bacteria in their intestine, which indicates that 536/ <dig> nematodes do not live longer than op50/ <dig> nematodes because they avoid pathogens and eat less. the fact that the intestinal pathogen burden is independent of developmental conditions also suggests that, in our case, the longer lifespan of nematodes developed on, and then exposed to, pathogens as adults were not the result of enhanced capacity to kill bacteria, but likely due to the increased tolerance to the damages inflicted by pathogenic bacteria. tolerance is defined as the ability to limit negative impact on hosts by increasing cellular repair and maintenance capacity, without affecting pathogen burden  <cit> . increased investment in repair and maintenance function often comes with a cost for the host. in our study there is no evidence of such cost as, nematodes developed on pathogen and then transferred to non-stressful conditions, i.e., innocuous bacterial strain, have lifespans identical to the lifespan of nematodes exposed to the innocuous bacterial strain throughout life. however, it cannot be excluded that the cost of tolerance becomes evident under experimental conditions that are closer to those found in natural environments.

from a molecular perspective, increased tolerance to pathogens of the nematodes developed on pathogens could be, at least partially, due to the induction of the heat shock response. we observed that adult nematodes developed on pathogens induce higher levels of expression of the hsp- <dig>  gene than nematodes developed on an innocuous strain. the hsp- <dig>  gene expression was shown to be regulated by daf- <dig> and hsf- <dig> transcription factors in the n <dig> nematodes  <cit> . it was previously observed that the expression level of hsp- <dig>  in individual nematodes exposed to a mild heat shock was predictive both of thermotolerance and lifespan  <cit> . overproduction of hsp- <dig>  also suppresses beta-amyloid peptide toxicity  <cit> . there are many other examples of the correlation between increased stress resistance and longevity in nematodes  <cit> . for example, the daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like pathway mediates stress resistance, longevity and pathogen resistance in c. elegans <cit> . this supports our hypothesis that the nematode’s response to developmental conditions observed in this study is genetically controlled by the daf-2/daf- <dig> insulin-like pathway. however, it was reported that daf- <dig> and dbl- <dig> mutants have an increased amount of live bacteria in their intestine compared to n <dig> nematodes when maintained on e. coli op <dig>  <cit> . on the contrary, a pmk- <dig> mutant has similar amount of live bacteria in its intestine when compared to that of n <dig> nematodes. thus, the absence of increased survival for daf- <dig> and dbl- <dig> mutants could also be due to an increased intestinal bacterial load following development on the pathogen, counterbalancing the beneficial effect of early pathogen exposure. further investigation of these signaling pathways will be necessary to determine the direct or indirect involvement of these pathways in the control of nematode response to developmental exposure to bacterial pathogens.

observed effect of developmental conditions on the adult lifespan and stress resistance could be described as hormetic. hormetic response in c. elegans, i.e., increased stress resistance and/or increased lifespan, was shown to be induced with sub-lethal abiotic stresses, like oxidative and thermal stress  <cit> . however, all forms of stress, e.g. uv or ionizing radiation, do not produce hormetic effects in c. elegans <cit> . our study shows that some biotic factors, i.e., bacterial pathogens, can be added to the list of known hormetic stressors. one possible explanation for the hormetic effects of exposure to low levels of stress is that the level of response to stress is more than necessary to repair the damage caused, thus increasing the nematode defense capacity and allowing tolerance to future stresses. a particularity of our study, contrary to other above-mentioned studies of the hormetic effect of different stressors on c. elegans, is that we induced hormetic effect by exposing nematodes to bacterial pathogens during development as stressors. we hypothesize that hormetic effects of early exposure to bacteria are common in nature as they were observed in a variety of organisms. for example, priming of innate immunity by pathogens has been reported for invertebrates such as c. elegans <cit>  and insects  <cit> . in some cases, immune priming can even be trans-generational, as observed for the mealworm beetle tenebrio molitor <cit> . it was shown that the presence of bacteria during the first week of the drosophila melanogaster adult life increases the flies lifespan  <cit> . the early life interactions between human host and bacteria, which largely occur through the colonization of the newborn intestine, are also increasingly recognized as being critical for the maturation of human immune system as well as for the metabolic homeostasis of the host  <cit> . newborn babies whose intestinal colonization was modified by the mode of delivery  or by antibiotic treatments, show a delay in immune response maturation  <cit> . early exposure of children, up to five years of age, to non-septic bacteria-rich environments, has a significant protective effect against the onset of allergies  <cit> . epidemiologic studies also show an increased occurrence of autoimmune diseases in human populations in “clean” environments  <cit> . these observations constitute the basis of the “hygiene hypothesis,” according to which the lack of exposure to microbes due to high hygienic conditions commonly found in the western world prevents correct maturation of the immune system and predisposes individuals to allergies and other immune diseases. these observations also correspond to the programming concept, which refers to stimuli that during critical periods of development may “program” the long-term structure or function of an organism  <cit> . our data establish that, at least in the c. elegans model, intentional administration of particular bacterial strains during early life could indeed modulate disease susceptibility during adulthood.

our study strongly suggests that variations induced during development are maintained in genetically identical adult nematodes, as it was previously reported for the nematodes that transiently passed through the stress-induced dauer larval stage  <cit> . in c. elegans, the molecular basis of such life-long memory of modifications of developmental transcription profiles is mediated by histone modifications  <cit> . whether histone modifications are also responsible for the phenotypes we observed remains to be determined.

although natural selection might favor improved sensing and response mechanisms, adaptation could also result in the emergence of more sophisticated response strategies. developmental plasticity allows for the production of phenotypically diverse offspring in populations of genetically identical individuals, which increases the probability of survival in changing and challenging environments. the evolution of the ability to mount such predictive developmental modifications depends on a number of features, such as the cost of developmental plasticity, ability to correctly detect and interpret environmental cues that depends on the frequency by which various environmental conditions are encountered, and finally on the long term fitness advantage provided. therefore, as described for e. coli plus saccharomyces cerevisiae <cit> , and c. elegans <cit> , the observed phenomenon could extend beyond merely sensing and responding immediately to a given stimulus and could contribute to a predictive response strategy that uses the appearance of a stimulus as a cue that future conditions might be stressful.

CONCLUSIONS
our study shows that development on pathogens has a hormetic effect on adult nematodes, as it results in increased resistance to different pathogens and to heat shock. such developmental plasticity of c. elegans nematodes, which are self-fertilizing homozygous animals producing offspring with negligible genetic variation, could increase the probability of survival in changing environments.
