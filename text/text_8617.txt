BACKGROUND
endoplasmic reticulum  is an essential cellular compartment for protein synthesis and maturation  <cit> . the perturbation of er functions such as disruption of ca++ homeostasis, inhibition of protein glycosylation or disulfide bond formation, hypoxia, and bacteria infections results in the accumulation of unfolded or mis-folded proteins in er lumen. to reduce the excessive mis-folded protein loading, cells trigger unfolded protein response  including the transient attenuation of protein translation, the degradation of mis-folded proteins, and the induction of molecular chaperones and protein folding enzymes  <cit> . in severe er stress, upr results in cell death through the activation of apoptotic pathways  <cit> .

three distinct upr signaling pathways exist in mammalian cells that include er transmembrane inositol-requiring enzyme  <dig> , pkr-like er kinase , and activating transcription factor  <dig>  pwthways  <cit> . the evolutionary conserved ire <dig> in the upr pathway plays as a ser/thr protein kinase and endoribonuclease  <cit> . upon the activation of ire1α by er stress, the endonuclease domain of ire <dig> splices the xbp <dig> mrna and removes  <dig> base pairs from the full-length xbp <dig> mrna by the unconventional splicing. this event results in the conversion of the premature unspliced xbp <dig> protein  to the spliced xbp <dig> protein  by the frame shift. xbp1s induces a subset of upr target genes related to protein quality control, er translocation, glycosylation, and er/golgi biogenesis  <cit> .

upr has been intensively studied in various model systems including mice and human cell lines. however, the upr pathway and its components have not yet been elucidated in the porcine model system. pigs are an important resource in biomedical research because they are more similar to humans than the rodent model  <cit> . therefore, pigs have wide implications for studying human diseases such as diabetes obesity, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases  <cit> . in addition, transgenic pigs are used as the bioreactor for the production of various growth hormones used in human medicine  <cit> . organs from cloned pigs produced by the somatic cell nuclear transfer  can be used in xenotransplantation  <cit> .

in this study, we report the function of pxbp <dig>  the porcine ortholog of the human xbp <dig>  in er stress. the unconventional splicing of pxbp <dig> mrna is evolutionary conserved. in the rna interference-mediated pxbp <dig> knock-down, we found that the pxbp <dig> participated in er stress-mediated cell death through the regulation of the target gene expression. we also detected the spliced pxbp1s mrna and protein in adult organs of pigs.

RESULTS
tunicamycin induces upr in pef cells
tunicamycin , which inhibits n-linked glycosylation in newly synthesized polypeptide, induces er stress  <cit> . we tested whether the treatment of tm triggers er stress-induced cell death in porcine embryonic fibroblast  cells. when cells were treated with tm for  <dig> h, we detected the morphological changes and the reduction of cell numbers . the effect of tm on er stress-mediated cell death was also detected by the morphological changes of apoptotic nuclei and the activity of caspase- <dig> . in addition, the cell viability was significantly decreased from  <dig> h in tm treated cells. the cell death was time and dose-dependent .

to access whether er stress response is activated in pef cells by the tm treatment, we measured the expression levels of a er stress marker bip  <cit>  and the activation of three major er stress sensors ire1α, perk, and atf <dig> with the western blot analysis. bip protein expression was significantly up-regulated from  <dig> h . ire1α and atf <dig> were activated from  <dig> h and perk was activated from  <dig> h after tm treatment . these results indicate that er stress induces unfolded protein response in pef cells.

cloning and sequence analysis of porcine xbp1
we focused on the ire1α-xbp <dig> pathway of upr in this study and cloned the porcine xbp <dig> gene  as described in materials and methods. porcine xbp <dig> mrna has two open reading frames  composed of  <dig> bp and  <dig> bp which are alternatively produced by the ire1α-mediated unconventional splicing . notably,  <dig> nucleotide sequences, splicing sites by ire1α, within xbp <dig> orf and its flanking sequence are identical with those of the human xbp <dig> sequences. when the secondary structures of pxbp <dig> sequence around the ire1α cleavage sites were predicted using centroidfold  <cit> , the consensus cleavage sites were located in the loop-portion . the amino acid sequences of the pxbp <dig> protein show significant homology with hxbp <dig> including the conserved basic leucine zipper  region. the amino acid similarity was 89% between pxbp <dig> and hxbp <dig> . phylogenetic tree of xbp <dig> sequences from various organisms was generated using the neighbor-joining method. the phylogenetic tree showed that the pxbp <dig> is a closer match to the human xbp <dig>  rather than that of a rat  or a mouse  .

unconventional splicing of the porcine xbp1
to elucidate whether ire1α-mediated splicing of pxbp <dig> mrna was triggered by er stress like a human xbp <dig> mrna, pef cells were treated with tm and performed the rt-pcr analysis. the spliced form of pxbp <dig> product  was detected in the tm treated cells from  <dig> h. the spliced pxbp <dig> mrna level was significantly increased during er stress . in the western blot analysis, the expression level of the activated pxbp <dig> protein  significantly up-regulated by the tm treatment from  <dig> h which is consistent with the rt-pcr analysis . these results indicate that pxbp <dig> mrna is processed upon er stress and can be used as a major marker for upr response in the porcine system.

nuclear localization of pxbp <dig> and erai vector system in pef cells
xbp <dig> belongs to a bzip transcription factor. when cells are challenged with er stress, activated xbp <dig> enters into the nucleus for activating its target genes  <cit> . when we tested the localization of xbp <dig> in the tm treated pef cells by the immunostaining, pxbp <dig> was predominantly localized in the nucleus after  <dig> h .

recently iwawaki et al  <cit>  reported the er stress-activated indicator  vector system for monitoring er stress with the green fluorescence protein . in the erai plasmid, human xbp-1-venus fusion construct contains the partial sequence of the human xbp <dig> and a gfp variant  sequence. upon er stress,  <dig> nucleotides of human xbp <dig> are spliced out and the xbp1-venus fusion protein is produced. to test whether erai works as an indicator for er stress in the porcine system, we checked the gfp signal in the erai transfected pef cells after tm treatment. we found that  <dig> % of total cells showed gfp signal in the tm treated erai-pef cells, not in tm non-treated erai-pef cells . this observation was consistent with the results of the western blot analysis. the band of the xbp-1-venus fusion protein  was very strong under er stress . these results suggest that the erai system can be used for monitoring the activation of upr in the porcine system.

porcine xbp <dig> plays a role in er stress-mediated cell death
to investigate whether pxbp <dig> is involved in er stress induced cell death, knock-down experiments were performed with pxbp <dig> sirna. pxbp <dig> knock-down cells expressed only 20% of pxbp <dig> mrna compared with the control sirna transfected cells . in addition, we performed the western blot analysis using the xbp- <dig> antibody in pxbp- <dig> knock-down pef cells. active and inactive xbp- <dig> proteins were significantly decreased in pxbp <dig> knock-down cells compared with the control sirna transfected cells . pxbp <dig> knock-down cells displayed decreased cell viability compared with the control sirna transfected cells . to further support the role of pxbp <dig> in survival during er stress, we compared the number of apoptotic cells in the control sirna and pxbp <dig> sirna transfected pef cells by the tunel staining. in pxbp <dig> knock-down cells, tunel positive cells increased about 10-fold compared with the control . these results indicate that the knock-down of pxbp <dig> is more sensitive to er stress-induced apoptosis, which is consistent with the published data in human myeloma cells  <cit> .

xbp <dig> activates its upr target genes for maintaining the er function and suppressing er stress-induced cell death. the inhibition of xbp <dig> activity by the dominant negative xbp <dig> or knock-down xbp <dig> markedly reduces the expression of xbp <dig> dependent upr target genes  <cit> . thus, we investigated the expression of pxbp <dig> target genes during er stress response. the knock-down pxbp <dig> significantly reduced the expression of erdj <dig> and p58ipk both in the normal condition and tm treated pef cells . in addition, well-known upr target genes, including bip, chop, and grp <dig>  were also significantly induced by tm treated pef cells, but reduced in the pxbp <dig> knock-down pef cells . these results suggest that pxbp <dig> dependent target gene expression might be required for maintaining cell viability in pef cells under the er stress condition.

porcine xbp <dig> as a upr marker in the porcine system
finally, we assessed the unconventional splicing pattern of pxbp <dig> as a upr marker in the porcine system. xbp <dig> is essential for development of liver and exocrine organs like the pancreas or salivary gland and holds a crucial role in immune systems and metabolic regulations  <cit> . to investigate expression of pxbp <dig> in adult porcine organs, we performed the rt-pcr and western blot analysis with adult organs. unspliced and spliced pxbp <dig> mrna and protein was expressed in liver, spleen, intestine, kidney, and ovary . in the absence of exogenously induced er stress, the unconventional splicing of pxbp <dig> takes place in adult tissues. these results support that pxbp <dig> can be used for monitoring er stress response and as a specific upr marker in the porcine system.

discussion
the porcine model system is important to study human diseases because it shares similarities with humans in similar organ sizes, anatomy, and physiology  <cit> . comparative genomic analysis showed that porcine genomic sequences are more similar to those of the human than to the genomic sequences of the mouse  <cit> . the upr pathway is valuable for cellular homeostasis and animal development. therefore, investigating the upr pathway and monitoring er stress in the model system is important to the study of pathogenic mechanisms that cause human diseases  <cit> .

the results of this study show the upr pathway in porcine system. as well as ire1α-xbp <dig> pathway, two er transmembrane proteins, perk and atf6α, play important roles in the mammalian upr. upon upr induction, atf6α is released by bip and exported to the golgi, where it is cleaved by s1p proteases  <cit> . cleaved atf6α acts as a transcriptional activator that can increase the expression of er chaperones and xbp <dig>  <cit> . in this study, we found that three upr components  are activated by er stress in porcine cells . among these three upr sensors, ire1α-xbp <dig> pathway plays a central role in er stress response by the transcriptional regulation of genes involved in er function. the amino acid sequence comparison and the phylogenetic analysis showed that pxbp <dig> has a high similarity to human xbp <dig>  in addition, the consensus sequence  in xbp <dig> mrna of ire1α target site is conserved between pigs and human . these results suggest that the ire1α-xbp <dig> pathway is evolutionary conserved in mammals.

conventional splicing is catalyzed by the spliceosome for removing an intron within a primary transcript  <cit> . in contrast, xbp <dig> pre-mrna is cleaved by ire1α endonuclease-mediated unconventional splicing and this process is independent of the spliceosome  <cit> . unconventional splicing of xbp <dig> mrna leads to the production of an active transcription factor and induction of adaptive genes in the mammalian upr. we showed that pxbp <dig> was also cleaved by unconventional splicing during er stress response . spliced pxbp <dig> mrna was detected in the tm treated cells from  <dig> h and gradually increased until  <dig> h. in contrast, the protein level of active pxbp1s peaked within  <dig> h and slightly decreased from  <dig> h. during er stress response, activated perk pathway attenuates global protein translation by phosphorylating the eif2α  <cit> . we also detected that active perk increased from  <dig> h in the tm treated cells . therefore, the translation of spliced and active xbp <dig> mrna may be attenuated by the perk-eif2α pathway.

in this study, we revealed that pxbp <dig> suppression is involved er-mediated cell death through the regulation of target gene expression, such as erdj <dig>  p58ipk, and bip. in addition, the er stress-induced expression of chop, a pro-apoptotic transcription factor, was also reduced in the pxbp <dig> knockdown cell . the chop promoter contains er stress response element  and amino-acid-regulatory element . all three upr transcription factors, atf <dig>  atf <dig> and xbp <dig>  can bind these promoter regions and regulate the transcription of chop  <cit> . the expression of chop is reduced in xbp <dig> knockout mef cell line  <cit>  and in pxbp <dig> knock-down porcine cells . these results indicate that pxbp- <dig> may be involved in the regulation of chop expression. however, perk-atf <dig> and atf6α are known as dominant regulators for the chop expression rather than xbp <dig>  <cit>  and all three upr pathways are required for the maximal induction of chop  <cit> .

studies in the mouse model show that the ire1α-xbp <dig> pathway is essential for the liver and heart development and the function of secretion in pancreatic exocrine and plasma cells  <cit> . the embryonic fibroblasts from xbp1-deficient mouse show defects in adipogenesis  <cit> . we have investigated expression of the inactive and active isoforms of pxbp <dig> in various porcine tissues. while unspliced pxbp <dig> was expressed in all examined tissues, spliced pxbp <dig> was strongly expressed in liver and kidney . furthermore, active pxbp1s protein was detected in all examined tissues except heart . this result indicates that pxbp <dig> plays a role in porcine tissues like other animals.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we show that unconventional splicing of pxbp <dig> mrna is evolutionary conserved and pxbp <dig> is involved in er-stress mediated apoptosis. in the adult porcine organs, spliced pxbp <dig> was expressed. these results suggest that pxbp <dig> can be used to monitor physiological and pathological er stress in the porcine model system.
