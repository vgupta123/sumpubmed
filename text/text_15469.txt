BACKGROUND
addictive disorders represent debilitating conditions that result in productivity loss, and an increased risk for associated mental disorders as well as infectious, metabolic, proliferative, respiratory, and vascular diseases  <cit> . addictions encompass substance-use disorders and compulsive behaviors  <cit> . the heritabilities of substance-use disorders are consistently found to be ~50 %  <cit>  with the lowest heritability for hallucinogen and highest for cocaine use disorders, respectively  <cit> . the ~2: <dig> monozygotic:dizygotic twin concordance ratios for many substance-use disorders support additive genetic effects and multiple loci  <cit> . estimates for the influence of genome-wide common variants on nicotine and alcohol dependence, and illicit drug use traits are ~30–36 %  <cit> , representing most of the estimated heritability. there is evidence for shared genetic influence across multiple substance-use disorders  <cit> .

among all substance-use disorders, smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the united states and is associated with cancer, aerodigestive tract, genitourinary tract, and vascular diseases  <cit> . nicotine dependence is most often assessed using measures of cigarette consumption  or dependence   <cit> . genetic influences predominate over environmental influences in smoking initiation, but shared environment is important during the adolescent period when the majority of future smokers initiate smoking  <cit> . developmental analyses suggest that genetic and environmental factors that influence risk for smoking initiation and consumption are independent in adolescence, but become correlated in emerging adults  <cit> . genome-wide meta-analyses of cigarette consumption, dependence, and exposure measures, including linkage  <cit>  and association  studies, have focused attention on multiple regions, including specific variants in cholinergic, cytochrome oxidase, dopaminergic, and hypoxia response genes.

people who quit smoking reduce their risk of disease and those who quit at an earlier age see the most health benefits  <cit> . an estimated 69 % of the approximately  <dig> million smokers in the united states want to stop smoking  <cit> . nonetheless, smoking cessation success rates remain discouragingly low; in  <dig>  only  <dig>  % of adult smokers attempting to quit were successful  <cit> . for those seeking to quit, there are a variety of counseling methods and cessation medications available  <cit> .

genetics plays a role in smokers’ cessation attempts , and response to cessation treatments  <cit> . pharmacogenetic analyses of smoking cessation clinical trials suggest that prospective abstinence is affected by loci influencing reward system responses to nicotine and pharmacotherapeutics, nicotine and bupropion metabolism, and varenicline clearance  <cit> . analyses of chr15q <dig>  snps and prospective abstinence by pharmacotherapy have been mixed: null , reduced in participants randomized to placebo  <cit> , and increased in participants randomized to multiple therapies  <cit> . in the largest analysis to date  <cit> , chr15q <dig>  smoking-heaviness risk snps were found to be associated with reduced abstinence in participants randomized to placebo, and increased abstinence in participants randomized to nicotine replacement therapy . in contrast, studies on functional variation in the nicotine metabolizing enzyme cytochrome p <dig> oxidase 2a <dig>   <cit>  translate robustly to smoking behaviors  <cit>  and prospective abstinence, using either nicotine metabolite , or genetic  analyses. in brief, recent findings suggest that slow nicotine metabolizers are less nicotine dependent and have similar quit rates across therapies, while fast nicotine metabolizers are more nicotine dependent and may benefit from combined treatments with nrt, bupropion, or varenicline.

despite these successes, attempts to individualize therapies using genetics have been limited by inconsistent results. existing evidence suggests that smoking cessation prediction is influenced by not just genetics, but also by patient characteristics  and treatment protocol . biomarkers, specifically the nicotine metabolite ratio , have also been shown to influence pharmacological therapies success  <cit> . advancing the understanding of complex relationships among multiple genetic and environmental factors, smoking behavior, nicotine dependence, and treatment outcomes requires large sample sizes. current clinical studies are challenged by relatively small sample sizes in treatment arms; thus, pooling data across clinical trials and observational studies is essential, but complicated by heterogeneity in trial study designs, genotyping technologies, and genetic marker content.

motivated by these obstacles, we developed the smokescreen genotyping array, a research tool for significantly advancing the understanding of addiction and the development of predictive models that can potentially be used to personalize treatment strategies for addiction, including nicotine- and tobacco-related outcomes.

genome-wide association markers
the array includes  <dig>  markers for genome-wide coverage of common genetic variations. the relationship between genome-wide array coverage and the observed correlation of imputed and actual genotypes  in  <dig> genomes phase  <dig> yri, asn, and eur populations is shown in fig.  <dig> . as the threshold on obsrsq increases , fewer variants exceed the threshold, and the coverage decreases . the array design achieves good coverage of common variants :  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % in yri, asn, and eur populations respectively, and covers  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % respectively of variants with maf ≥  <dig> . the average obsrsq for variants with maf ≥  <dig>  were  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  for yri, asn, and eur respectively, and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for variants with maf ≥  <dig> . these metrics demonstrate the array’s suitability for genome-wide analyses and meta analyses based on genotype imputation using  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig> data.fig.  <dig> smokescreen coverage estimates by increasing observed imputation r

 <dig>  is the correlation between imputed  genotype dosage and the measured genotype from the  <dig> genomes project. the proportion of  <dig> genome project phase  <dig> variants with an obsrsq above the threshold on the x-axis is represented on the y-axis. the average obsrsq differs by race/ethnicity and by array content categories . the coverage  decreases as the obsrsq threshold increases. a typical threshold used in evaluating array coverage is  <dig> 



addiction genes
the array contains  <dig>  markers for dense coverage of  <dig> genes  across populations. the array captures  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  % of common variants  and  <dig>  %,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % of maf ≥  <dig>  variants in yri, asn, and eur populations, respectively, directly through linkage disequilibrium . the fraction of variants covered by genotype imputation in these gene regions for yri, asn, and eur populations is shown in fig.  <dig> . consequently, the array has outstanding imputation coverage  of common variants and excellent coverage of maf ≥  <dig>  variants:  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  % for yri, asn, and eur respectively . in the same order, average obsrsq of all variants within the addiction gene regions were  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for common variants, and  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  for maf ≥  <dig>  variants, indicating that imputation works well for most variants in these regions. the list of  <dig> genes and each region’s imputation metrics are provided in additional file  <dig> 

fine-mapping
eight thousand, nine hundred and fourty-eight snps and indels  were selected for the  <dig> kb ld block encompasing the chr15q <dig>  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor  gene cluster . for cyp2a6 ,  <dig> markers were selected with an average of  <dig> marker every  <dig> base pairs. for cyp2b6 ,  <dig> markers were selected with  <dig> marker per  <dig> base pairs on average. as expected, the imputed coverage and average obsrsq was greater than 99 % in the  <dig> genomes project phase  <dig> yri, asn, and eur populations, regardless of minor allele frequency. additional markers were selected to capture variation in the surrounding region, including egln <dig>  cyp2a <dig>  cyp2g1p, and cyp2b7p <dig> 

additional content
additional markers were included in the design for compatibility with consortium-developed arrays and most recent findings . the array contains:  <dig> markers from the candidate gene/pathway arrays developed and used by the pharmacogenetics of nicotine addiction treatment  research program  <cit> ;  <dig> markers from a lung cancer meta-gwas  <cit> ;  <dig> markers related to psychiatric comorbidities from the psychiatric genetics consortium  <cit> ; and  <dig> and  <dig> markers for pulmonary and cardiovascular phenotypes respectively from the uk biobank axiom array  <cit> .

the array also includes:  <dig> markers related to addiction identified in recent literature from nida genetics consortium investigators;  <dig>  markers used in the smoking cessation v <dig>  quit success score biomarker  <cit> ;  <dig> pharmacogenomic markers related to absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion ; and  <dig> markers identified in previous genome-wide association studies or addiction and related diseases  <cit> . the array includes a panel of  <dig> ancestry informative markers  for ancestry estimation and evaluation of population substructure.

genotyping quality
from  <dig> samples derived from blood or cell line,  <dig>  passed quality control based on recommended best practices for axiom arrays by affymetrix  <cit> . several samples were excluded from subsequent analyses; one sample failed to scan, eight had dish qc <  <dig>  due to a sample processing issue, and five had stage one genotype call rates < 97 %. in addition, seven negative controls were processed across the genotyping plates, and all exhibited low separation from the background signal as expected. in passing samples,  <dig>   of the markers on the array passed quality control, using affymetrix recommended best practices. with default settings of affymetrix snpolisher classifications, we removed:  <dig>  markers classified as “other”;  <dig> classified as “callratebelowthreshold”;  <dig> classified as “off-target variant ”;  <dig> classified as “hemizygous”; and  <dig> classified as “monohighresolution” that also had previously failed affymetrix’s internal validation process .table  <dig> snp classifications and recommendations using  <dig> passing samples derived from blood or cell line

‘previously validated’ or ‘previously failed-validation’ are markers tested by the manufacturer. ‘de novo’ are markers on the array but not validated by the manufacturer. ‘polyhighresolution’ and ‘nominorhom’ are markers with good cluster resolution. ‘monohighresolution’ indicates that fewer than two examples of the minor allele was present. ‘callratebelowthreshold’ indicated that the snp call rate is below the threshold while other properties are above the threshold. ‘other’ are markers where one or more cluster properties falls below its threshold



the average genotype reproducibility in  <dig> replicate pairs across all passing snps was  <dig>  %. of the passing markers,  <dig>   were monomorphic,  <dig>   had minor allele frequency  greater than  <dig> and less than  <dig> ;  <dig>   had maf between  <dig>  and  <dig> ;  <dig>   had maf greater than or equal to  <dig> . for  <dig> hapmap samples  <cit>   and  <dig>  passing markers that overlapped with hapmap <dig> release  <dig> , the average genotype concordance was  <dig>  %.

smokescreen application to nicotine metabolism analysis in multiple populations
unrelated african american , asian american , and european american ancestry individuals  from three existing laboratory-based nicotine metabolism studies were selected for genotyping on the smokescreen array  <cit> . for all samples, the nmr is defined as the trans-3’-hydroxycotinine to cotinine ratio. in these three studies, biospecimens were collected, and creatinine-adjusted cotinine and trans-3’-hydroxycotinine levels were estimated via mass spectrometry using an established method  <cit> .

in the pharmacokinetics in twins   <cit>  study, participants were recruited from the northern california twin registry in a multiple stage protocol to coordinate ascertainment of twins to investigate heritability and genetic components of nicotine metabolism. participants consented to a 30-min venous administration of nicotine and cotinine, followed by an 8-hour hospital stay for blood and urine biosample collection. in the pharmacogenetic study of nicotine metabolism   <cit> , recruiting by smoking status and gender of european, african, and asian americans was performed through multi-media advertisements for a nicotine and cotinine metabolism study. participants consented to morning oral administration of nicotine, and either labeled  or unlabeled  cotinine. the following biospecimens were collected: saliva up to 60 h after dosing; blood up to 480 min; urine up to 8 h. in the smoking in families  study  <cit> , individuals from  <dig> pedigrees with at least three ever-smokers individuals per pedigree originally recruited to assess the relations among genetic factors, environmental factors, and tobacco use, consented to oral administration of a fixed dose of nicotine and cotinine at home monitored by a nurse, followed by salivary sample collection at multiple time points as well as a blood sample for dna analysis  <cit> .

three hundred fifteen samples passed quality control with complete data and were included in the analyses . multiple factors including population structure principal components, age, sex, bmi, and smoking status were incorporated to model nmr in a genome-wide, multi-ethnic meta-analysis. adequate type i error control was observed with genome-wide significant results at cyp2a <dig> . the top snp accounts for 12 %, 27 %, and 19 % of the nmr variation in european americans, african americans, and asian americans, respectively. the minimum p-value in the nearby cyp2b <dig> region was  <dig> e- <dig> with association patterns differing by ancestry . association patterns with the nmr remained intact for cyp2b <dig> in an analysis adjusting for cyp2a6’s top snp; other cyp2a <dig> snps showed evidence of independent association after this adjustment .fig.  <dig>

discussion
until recently, manufacturing a genotyping array, especially with primarily custom-content, was prohibitively expensive. the smokescreen array represents the next generation of targeted arrays, providing both baseline genome-wide content, and enhanced coverage of important regions and pathways specific to a phenotype or group of related phenotypes. the popularity of these similarly-sized arrays can be seen in the psychiatric genetics consortium infinium psycharray  <cit>  with  <dig>  snps  and the oncoarray consortium oncoarray-500 k  <cit>  with  <dig>  snps . these three arrays offer a core set of markers that provide similar imputation-based genome-wide coverage. used a procedure similar to nelson et al.  <cit> , we estimated that the smokescreen design covers 66 %, 82 %, and 91 % of common variants  in yri, asn, and eur, respectively. the smokescreen array includes extensive custom content , focusing on enhancing coverage of gene regions and pathways related to addiction , and attributable disease  in multiple populations. consortia developed arrays have similar goals: to provide content of value to researchers studying related phenotypes and to provide data for large meta-analyses and replication studies.

genome-wide arrays, such as smokescreen, allow for imputation of common and rare genotypes using haplotype reference panels. recent haplotype projects  allow for more accurate imputation of less common and rare variants  <cit> . the ability to genotype large numbers of study samples and impute more variants accurately, enables powerful meta-gwas studies  <cit> . additionally, genome-wide imputation allows for discovery of associations in regions not directly enriched for in the array design. this is important as meta-analysis consortia and multiple methods  <cit>  identify additional addiction-related regions.

there are some limitations in the estimation of smokescreen array performance. it should be noted that the coverage is an estimate based on the design of the array. the realized coverage is not yet computable as the validation of markers is ongoing. approximately 12 % of snps on the array are too rare to be observed with the current sample size. additional samples will improve genotype clustering of rare snps or snps with low quality metrics. some pilot samples derived from saliva were genotyped, but the sample size was not sufficient for estimating performances on these samples separately. in general, we recommend saliva samples to be collected using kits with preservatives. laboratories familiar with axiom arrays should assess the quality of salivary samples with suspect collection or storage method prior to genotyping.

ascertainment biases in the markers selected on the array or the reference population used in imputation may lead to lower coverage, as commonly observed in african ancestry populations. however, increasing coverage on the array  booster panel) and diverse reference panels for imputation, helps mitigate this issue. another limitation of these approaches over sequencing, is the identification of de novo mutations. these mutations, however, account for a small fraction of both rare and common neurodevelopmental diseases and require pedigrees for analysis  <cit> .

we envision the smokescreen array driving translational research by facilitating the development of algorithms, derived from multiple genetic and clinical factors for risk prediction and treatment approach assignments. previously, genome-wide allelotyping analyses of smoking cessation trials revealed associations of common variants with prospective abstinence  <cit> . this research lead to the design of a clinical trial analysis model incorporating a “quit-success” genetic score, which retrospectively predicted abstinence in a randomized trial stratifying smokers by nicotine replacement therapy dose and dependence  <cit> . this model used both genetic  and clinical  information. we re-envision this model based on a smokescreen analysis platform that incorporates individual level genotype data, additional clinical factors, and the multi-stage process of validation and utility assessment in large sample sizes derived from meta-analysis of multiple trials  <cit> . for example, genotyping samples with multiple addiction-related phenotypes will permit genome-wide correlation  and estimation of the extent of shared variance and polygenicity among dependence, attributable disease, and treatment response; the proportion of shared variance among dependencies using genome-wide correlation is substantial  <cit> .

the addiction-related gene content of smokescreen is designed to be helpful in pharmacogenetic analyses of current or future addiction gene targets. in an analysis of the psychiatric genetic consortium schizophrenia findings  <cit> ,  <dig> of the  <dig> protein-coding genes linked to gwas hits were identified as targets of existing drugs or drugs undergoing phase iii trials  <cit> . lencz and malhotra conclude that six protein-coding genes  are of greatest neuropsychiatric and genetic interest. three of these six genes  are included in smokescreen’s group of addiction-related genes; overall,  <dig> of the  <dig> target genes are included in smokescreen’s gene list with increased coverage, suggesting smokescreen’s usefulness for addiction-related drug development studies. coverage of the nicotine metabolizing enzyme genes cyp2a <dig> and cyp2b <dig>  the opportunity to incorporate nmr measures in larger studies, and novel analytical methods may improve nicotine metabolism models, which currently predict between  <dig> and 70 % of variance in european ancestry populations  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the smokescreen array achieves robust genome-wide coverage of common variants, and exceptional coverage of  <dig> genes relevant to addiction and known nicotine metabolism and smoking behavior regions in african , asian, and european populations. these, paired with content from recent findings and related work in pharmacogenomics, comorbidities, and attributable diseases create a comprehensive genotyping array for addiction research. analytical validity and utility were demonstrated through pilot genotyping of hapmap and study samples. for hapmap samples, the genotype concordance for overlapping content was > 99 %. based on samples from nicotine metabolism laboratory studies, we identified variants at genome-wide significance in a region known to be highly influential on nicotine metabolism, serving as a positive confirmation of the array’s design. these attributes enable researchers to perform genome-wide, candidate gene, and pathway-based association analyses on various addictions, including those related to smoking and tobacco use.
