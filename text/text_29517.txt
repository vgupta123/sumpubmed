BACKGROUND
the dark and nutrient poor cave environment exerts substantial pressure upon cave-dwelling animals. perhaps as a consequence of these limited resources, cave-adapted animals from most major phyla exhibit a remarkable convergence in morphological and physiological changes related to cave life, including features that are both constructive  and regressive   <cit> . although these changes have been studied in a diverse set of cave animals, the genetic and evolutionary mechanisms responsible for them remain poorly understood.

although natural selection is probably involved in the evolution of constructive cave adapted phenotypes  <cit> , the evolutionary forces driving regressive changes are less certain. darwin suggested that eye degeneration - one of the most conspicuous traits found in cave animals - evolved due to disuse  <cit> . this idea was refined by others to implicate neutral mutation and genetic drift as a consequence of relaxed selection for vision in the cave environment  <cit> . the neutral hypothesis was favored until recently when the results of new genetic and developmental studies supported the adaptive evolution of eye regression in cave animals. three competing hypotheses have been proposed for the adaptive evolution of eye regression:  direct natural selection against eyes to conserve energy in the resource poor cave environment  <cit> ;  indirect selection against eyes to open sufficient space for the elaboration of constructive characters  <cit> ; and  indirect selection against eyes due to the enhancement of traits that are negatively linked to optic development by antagonistic pleiotropy  <cit> . distinguishing among these hypotheses has been difficult since the genetic basis of eye reduction is unknown in cave-dwelling animals.

the teleost astyanax mexicanus is an excellent model organism for studying the evolution of traits associated with cave life, including eye regression  <cit> . within the past few million years, at least five independent colonizations by two different migrational waves of eyed surface fish have established  <dig> geographically isolated astyanax cavefish populations in northeastern mexico  <cit> . after subsequent radiation underground, the founder cavefish populations became isolated in separate caves and evolved eye regression, reduced pigmentation or albinism, enhanced sensory systems and behavioral changes associated with cave life  <cit> . despite this isolation, astyanax surface fish and cavefish are interfertile in the laboratory, allowing the evolution of constructive and regressive traits to be studied by genetic analysis.

previous studies reported that eye degeneration in astyanax is triggered by lens apoptosis and dysfunction due to expanded sonic hedgehog  gene expression along the embryonic midline  <cit> . additionally, shh hyper expression was shown to increase jaw width and taste bud number, and to mediate the expansion of the forebrain and hypothalamus  <cit> . in a recent study, elipot et al. found that shh modifies the hypothalamic serotonergic network and increases foraging efficiency in cavefish by shifting behavior from fighting to foraging  <cit> . these experiments support the hypothesis that eye regression in astyanax has evolved at least in part as a result of indirect selection against eyes in favor of increased feeding efficiency through pleiotropy of the shh genes. however, recent genetic studies have discovered  <dig> to  <dig> quantitative trait loci  involved in eye reduction in astyanax cavefish  <cit> , but none that are linked to either the shha or shhb genes, suggesting that upstream modulators of the shh signaling system and/or other genetic factor may be important in eye regression .

in the present study, we launch an alternative approach to address the evolutionary mechanisms involved in eye degeneration. assuming a positive relationship between visual decay and the evolution of constructive changes in other sensory systems - as has been proposed by many previous investigators  <cit>  - we investigated the genetic basis of a constructive trait, the vibration attraction behavior , to evaluate its possible relationship to eye degeneration. vab is the swimming of cavefish toward an oscillating object, a behavior that has evolved repeatedly in different astyanax cavefish populations  <cit>  and which may be present in amblyopsid cavefish as well  <cit> . vab is mediated by an increase in the number and size of cranial superficial neuromasts  in cavefish  <cit> . although vab is usually absent in surface fish, a small proportion of those raised in the laboratory can show a weak form of vab. in wild populations of surface fish, vab is presumably deleterious since it may be easily detectable by predators  <cit> . in contrast, vab is adaptive in cavefish since it increases foraging in an environment devoid of light with sparse food and no macroscopic predators  <cit> .

here we report the results of genetic analyses of vab, sn enhancement and eye size. using this approach, we discovered that the qtl underlying vab, a specific class of sn located within the cavefish eye orbit , and reduced eyes form two distinct clusters of overlapping qtl that together explain a significant portion of the genetic variation underlying these traits. by ablation of eo sn, we discovered that these sensory receptors contribute to vab. moreover, by shh overexpression, we also showed that induction of eye degeneration in surface fish did not induce vab or increase eo sn, suggesting that these traits are part of an antagonistic system impacting eye formation that is independent of shh signaling, and that the extra space opened by eye regression is insufficient to promote the appearance of these constructive traits. therefore, we propose that the adaptive evolution of vab and eo sn enhancement has contributed to eye degeneration in astyanax cavefish.

RESULTS
a small number of genetic factors control vab and sn number
to determine the phenotypic and genetic relationship among eye size, vab and sn enhancement, we first estimated the number of genetic factors that control these traits. we crossed a female texas surface fish with a male pachón cavefish and raised about  <dig> f <dig> individuals. one pair of these f <dig> progeny was crossed to generate  <dig> f <dig> individuals for phenotypic and genetic analysis. we then measured the degree of vab, sn number and size at suborbital bone  <dig>   <cit> , sn number within the eye orbit  and overall eye size in each individual. the distribution of vab and sn scores among the p <dig>  f <dig> and f <dig> generations suggests that all four traits are heritable and controlled by one or more genetic factors . classic castle-wright estimates of the effective number of loci for vab, so- <dig> sn number and diameter, and eo sn number were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  and  <dig>  ±  <dig> , respectively . however, because the f <dig> individuals from this cross did not recapitulate the entire distribution of cavefish vab phenotypes , we crossed another pair of f <dig> progeny from the same p <dig> to generate an additional f <dig> family. we used marker-assisted selection to choose three pairs of f <dig> individuals from this family that were hetero- or homozygous for cavefish alleles at two putative vab and three so- <dig> sn qtl loci . we then crossed these f <dig> in order to generate  <dig> f <dig> individuals that recovered the entire cavefish vab phenotype, although the distributions for so- <dig> and eo sn remain somewhat restricted . in combination with the original  <dig> f <dig>  these additional f <dig> were included to increase our ability to detect correlations and qtl for the vab, sn and eye size phenotypes.

vab and eye size are strongly correlated with eo sn but not so- <dig> sn
since sn are the sensory receptors that facilitate vab  <cit> , we expected the number of sn to be strongly correlated with the level of vab in our hybrid families. in a previous study using cavefish, surface fish and their f <dig> progeny, we found a significant positive correlation between vab and the number of sn at so- <dig>  which are located in the cranial region immediately ventral to the eo  <cit> . however, in the present study using both f <dig> and f <dig> hybrids, we found that the correlation between these two traits was not significant , although the correlation between vab and sn diameter at so- <dig> was significant . this new result suggests that the number of sn at so- <dig> may not be the most important parameter determining vab. after further examination of sn within the cranial regions of surface fish and cavefish, we found that sn are located in the eo in cavefish  and in f <dig> and f <dig> hybrids with reduced eyes, but not in surface fish . in contrast to the results for so- <dig> sn, we found that the number of eo sn was positively correlated with vab  and negatively correlated with eye size , and that eye size was also negatively correlated with vab . these results suggest that vab may be mediated by an increase in eo sn and that both traits are negatively correlated with eye size.

genetic linkage mapping and qtl analysis
to determine the number and position of the genetic loci controlling vab, sn number and eye size, we first constructed a genetic linkage map of the astyanax genome from  <dig> markers genotyped among  <dig> f <dig> individuals. most of the markers represent randomly-distributed microsatellite polymorphisms, but we also included  <dig> markers representing candidate genes for sn development, behavioral variation and other previously mapped traits   <cit> . our linkage map recovered  <dig> linkage groups  spanning  <dig>  cm . since astyanax have  <dig> haploid chromosomes  <cit> , this map likely covers the entire genome. our map is comparable to a previously published astyanax genetic map  <cit>  constructed from a cross between a mexican surface fish and pachón cavefish. small discrepancies in marker order and inter-marker distance between this previous map and ours are likely due to the use of different surface fish populations.

using this linkage map, we performed three types of qtl scans:  classic interval mapping with a single-qtl model treating the f <dig> and f <dig> separately, as well as combining these f <dig> and f <dig> datasets;  a modified single-qtl analysis using both f <dig> and f <dig> but accounting for kinship among these generations in qtlrel  <cit> ; and  multiple qtl mapping with both f <dig> and f <dig> as implemented by the function stepwiseqtl in r/qtl  <cit> . by comparing the results of the first and second analyses , we assessed the consistency of our qtl scans as well as the potential noise caused by using multiple generations. if the results were similar and relatively unaffected by kinship , we then applied the multiple qtl scan in stepwiseqtl since our castle-wright estimates suggest that a minimum of two or more loci control most traits . we analyzed six traits using the classic and modified single-qtl models . we found similar results for all traits except so- <dig> sn number and diameter . these two traits exhibited large variance components due to kinship and we thus dropped them from further analysis. the variance components of the remaining traits were small . using stepwiseqtl with both f <dig> and f <dig> to analyze albinism and eye size, we were able to detect two previously-reported qtl for albinism at the oca <dig> gene locus on lg <dig>  <cit>   and for eye size on lg  <dig>  <cit> . we conclude that we can safely drop relatedness for the remaining traits and, therefore, show the results for multiple qtl mapping using the combined f <dig> and f <dig> datasets.

n is the number of f <dig> and f <dig> individuals used, lod is the log of odds ratio, and pve is the percentage of phenotypic variance explained. the summed pve of all qtl are shown at the top row of each trait . effect size and direction  of qtl refers to the magnitude of shift between homozygotes of surface fish alleles and cavefish alleles. the numbers in parentheses indicate the ranges of phenotypes. three qtl for eye diameter/sl at lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> require further analyses to be confirmed .

two qtl for cavefish vab at  <dig> hz but not other frequencies
we initially surveyed qtl for vab at different vibration stimuli. as reported previously, cavefish show the strongest vab at  <dig> hz and intermediate-levels at  <dig> and  <dig> hz; additionally, some surface fish show an intermediate-level of vab at a broad range between  <dig> and  <dig> hz  <cit> . by performing an abbreviated qtl scan using the single-qtl model, we detected two significant qtl for vab, but only with the  <dig> hz stimulus . this indicates that cavefish vab at  <dig> hz has a genetic basis. the same vab qtl were revealed using stepwiseqtl mapping below.

two qtl clusters control vab, eo sn number and eye size
by performing stepwiseqtl, we detected nine qtl: two each for vab and eo sn number on lg  <dig> and  <dig>  and five for eye size on lgs  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> . the qtl for vab and eo sn number were relatively consistent across all types of analyses, allowing for some variation since single-qtl models are not designed to detect qtl for complex traits. the eye size qtl on lg  <dig> and  <dig> were also consistent among analyses, but the eye qtl on lg  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were not evident in the single-qtl scans . although this result may be expected since eye size is genetically complex in astyanax  <cit> , these three qtl will need to be confirmed in future analyses. we did not detect significant epistasis among any of these qtl . for each phenotype, the sum of detected qtl accounted for  <dig> %,  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the total phenotypic variance in vab, eo sn number and eye size, respectively . although the qtl for these three traits were found on five different linkage groups distributed throughout the astyanax genome, the bayesian credible intervals for six vab, eo sn and eye size qtl formed congruent or overlapping clusters on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> . particularly noteworthy, the credible intervals for the two most significant eye size qtl overlap with the two qtl for vab and eo sn number . the observed number of qtl clusters for these three traits is significantly higher than expected by under a poisson distribution   <cit> . since alleles located within short genomic regions are generally inherited together as a unit, these qtl clusters support the physical correlations we found for vab, eo sn number and eye size .

further examination of these overlapping qtl supports the hypothesis that vab is enhanced by expanding the number of sn within the eo at the cost of eyes. we found that the cavefish alleles at each qtl shift the vab, sn and eye size phenotypes in the direction expected given the distribution of these phenotypes between the surface fish and cavefish p0; when vab level was high there were more sn and smaller eyes than when vab level was low or absent . none of the  <dig> candidate genes were associated with any of the  <dig> qtl. as reported previously  <cit> , the shha locus was not located in or near any of the eye size qtl . in addition, alphaa crsytallin  and shroom <dig>  which were located within eye qtl in a previous study  <cit> , did not map to an eye size qtl in the present analysis. the significant clustering of vab, eo sn and eye size qtl on lg  <dig> and  <dig> supports the conclusion that the genetic factors responsible for vab and eo sn enhancement are also responsible for eye regression, either as a result of genetic hitchhiking or pleiotropy.

the eo sn are major receptors for vab
the results of the quantitative genetic analyses suggest that vab and eo sn number are phenotypically and genetically linked to eye size in astyanax cavefish. these results raise the intriguing possibility that vab is facilitated by an increase in eo sn in cavefish. to test this hypothesis, we compared the level of vab among cavefish whose area of eo or so- <dig> sn were ablated. following eo sn ablation, cavefish showed a significant decrease in vab . in contrast, cavefish showed only a minor reduction in vab following ablation of so- <dig> sn, which was not significant . although the eo sn ablation included a part of the so- <dig> region, as well as some canal neuromasts , eo sn were consistently removed, whereas so- <dig> ablation removed more sn than the total number of eo sn . thus, even though cavefish have fewer eo sn than so- <dig> sn, these ablation experiments provide strong evidence that sn in the eo area are the main sensory receptors responsible for vab.

shh-mediated eye degeneration is insufficient to facilitate vab and eo sn
although the genes that increase vab and eo sn may drive eye regression through genetic hitchhiking or pleiotropy , it is still possible that reduced eye size alone may increase vab. to test this alternative possibility, we further compared the level of vab among surface fish with experimentally regressed eyes following shha overexpression  <cit> . in addition to eye size, expanded shh expression is also known to increase jaw width and taste bud number in cavefish  <cit> , suggesting that this pathway could potentially alter sn number or vab. following shha mrna overexpression, eye diameter varied considerably among surface fish , but was not associated with a significant increase in vab , eo sn , or so- <dig> sn  . these results suggest that shh-induced eye regression is insufficient to increase eo sn and vab and that the molecular pathway decreasing eye size concomitantly with vab and eo sn enhancement is parallel to the shh pathway. we conclude that the same or closely linked genetic factors responsible for the enhancement of eo sn and vab are also responsible for the reduction in eye size .

discussion
we have shown that eye regression in astyanax cavefish is phenotypically and genetically correlated with the evolution of vab, an adaptive trait controlling feeding efficiency  <cit> , as well as the enhancement of its sensory receptors, sn specifically localized within the eo. genetic mapping studies revealed clusters of congruent or overlapping qtl on lg  <dig> and  <dig> that control eye size, vab and the number of eo sn. in addition, we have also demonstrated a significant role of the eo sn in vab, and that the open space created by shh-induced eye degeneration is insufficient to promote vab or sn enhancement. this experimental result further highlights the importance of the genetic linkage between eye loss and the vab sensory system. our results support the hypothesis that selection for an adaptive behavior and its underlying sensory receptors are enhanced in cavefish at the expense of eyes. to our knowledge, this is the first study to report phenotypic and genetic relationships between a regressive phenotype, an adaptive behavior and the sensory system responsible for this behavior.

we have discovered a significant genetic correlation between vab and eo sn number but not between vab and so- <dig> sn number and size. this result was surprising in light of our previous studies, which found that removal of so- <dig> sn reduced  vab  <cit> . a possible explanation for this discrepancy is that the physical sn ablation method used in our previous study did not discriminate effectively between eo sn and so- <dig> sn, which are present in adjacent regions in the cavefish cranium, or that the actual contribution of so- <dig> sn to vab is minor compared to that of eo sn. our current ablation study supports either explanation by showing that eo sn are the major vab receptors, whereas so- <dig> sn, despite their larger number, have only a minor role in vab . although our eo sn ablation experiment also ablated some so- <dig> sn and canal neuromasts, we conclude that the latter receptors play a minor role in vab for two reasons. first, in the so- <dig> sn ablation experiment, more sn were ablated than eo sn. yet, despite the loss of more sn in so- <dig>  the level of vab was not attenuated significantly . in contrast, deleting a much smaller population of eo sn resulted in a dramatic and statistically significant reduction in vab . second, in several former studies, the involvement of canal neuromasts in vab was excluded through three observations:  selective sn ablation was enough to decrease vab even while maintaining canal neuromasts  <cit> ,  cavefish vab was tuned to the frequency at the peak sensitivity of sn but not of canal neuromasts  <cit> , and  the selective interference with canal neuromasts failed to attenuate the response  <cit> . so what makes eo sn necessary for vab? it is possible that there are structural or neural circuitry differences between the two populations of eo and so- <dig> sn that may account for our results, or that the eo sn are better positioned above the eye socket to detect fluctuations in water due to the bulging shape of the adipose tissue plug that fills the eye orbits of cavefish  <cit>  or bulging eye balls of f <dig> and f <dig> hybrids  <cit> . however, since the level of vab did not drop to zero in our eo sn ablation, it seems likely that other sn contribute to vab as well, possibly including sn at so- <dig> and on the dorsal trunk  <cit> .

our present investigation has also clarified the difference between the strong type of vab observed in cavefish  and the weaker form previously detected in a small proportion of surface fish raised in the laboratory   <cit> . cavefish vab peaks at  <dig> hz, whereas surface fish vab shows a continuous low activity from  <dig> to  <dig> hz  <cit> . in this study, vab showed two genetic components detectable at  <dig> hz, but none at  <dig> or  <dig> hz, suggesting that the weak form of surface fish vab appears without a major genomic change and could be accomplished through environmental effects and/or developmental plasticity. considering that at least three cavefish populations  exhibit a strong form of vab  <cit> , vab may, therefore, represent a broadly distributed evolutionary trait in cavefish. the elaboration of sn at a new site, the eo, could have been a key factor in the evolution of vab during adaptation to subterranean habitats  <cit> . determining the mechanisms underlying eo sn development and vab among independently evolved cave populations  <cit>  could open a path to understanding the origins of neurological and behavioral novelty during evolution.

the major conclusions of this study are that eo sn number is strongly correlated with both vab and eye size, and that all three traits are controlled by qtl on lgs  <dig> and  <dig> with congruent or overlapping bayesian credible intervals. these results suggest that the gene loci responsible for vab, eo sn number and eye-size may be subject to possible physical linkage and genetic hitchhiking or may in fact be the same genes with pleiotropic effects. the existence of qtl clusters could facilitate rapid adaptation to environmental changes by concurrently fixing multiple beneficial traits. previous qtl analyses have also shown tight linkages and overlapping qtl for several other cavefish traits, including eye size, lens size, taste bud number, tooth number, melanophore number and chemical sense ability  <cit> . this observation suggests that adaptation to cave life in astyanax is the result of tradeoffs among many phenotypic traits, possibly through functional shifts within pluripotent neural crest cells which contribute to most of the above traits through developmental processes  <cit> . however, one must note that widespread clustering of qtl does not necessarily entail a phenotypic tradeoff. in a previous scan of qtl in astyanax, protas et al. reported the overlap of six qtl for eye size and melanophore number , yet the phenotypic correlation between these traits is only r = - <dig>   <cit> .

the present investigation provides a clear example of a tradeoff between constructive traits  and a regressive trait  in parallel to the shh-signaling pathway. the short genomic distance between the qtl for eye regression, eo sn and vab  <cit>  could be a key factor in promoting the rapid adaptation of astyanax to a novel environment. in other rapidly evolving animals, such as african cichlids and three-spined sticklebacks, qtl clusters have also been shown to control groups of potentially advantageous traits, including sex determination and body color, and body shape and plate number  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we have discovered a significant genetic correlation among eye size, vab and eo sn number. our results, therefore, support the hypothesis that eye loss has evolved in astyanax cavefish as a result of indirect selection against eyes due to a trade-off between two constructive traits, vab and eo sn enhancement, based either on genetic hitchhiking or pleiotropy. there has been a long-standing debate on the neutrality or benefit of eye regression in cave animals  <cit> . since cave-adapted arthropods exhibit reduced eyes and elongated sensory antennae  <cit> , the loss of eyes as a result of selection for increased tactile sensitivity is an attractive general hypothesis for the convergent evolution of eye regression in cave fauna.
