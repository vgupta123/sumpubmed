BACKGROUND
caspases belong to a unique class of cysteine proteases which function as critical effectors of apoptosis, inflammation and other important cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, cell migration and receptor internalization  <cit> . caspases contain a cysteine residue at the active site and cleave substrates at specific tetrapeptide sites  with a highly conserved aspartate  at the p <dig> position  <cit> . to date at least  <dig> mammalian caspases have been discovered and they can be grouped into three classes based on their preferential tetrapeptide specificities  <cit> . group i caspases  recognize the sequence ehd; group ii caspases  prefer the sequence dexd; while group iii caspases  cleave proteins with the sequence ed.

as reviewed in earnshaw et al.  <cit>  and fischer et al.  <cit> , substrates of caspases belong to a myriad of protein classes such as structural elements of cytoplasm and nucleus, components of the dna repair machinery, protein kinases, gtpases and viral structural proteins. although more than  <dig> caspase substrates have been discovered to date, it is possible that several more remain undetected  <cit> . the identification and characterization of caspase substrates are critical for deepening our understanding of the role of these enzymes in the various cellular pathways. however, the accurate detection of caspase cleavage sites in target proteins requires complex and time consuming in vivo and in vitro experiments. given the readily available sequence data in public databases, a useful alternative is to conduct in silico screening for potential cleavage sites among proteins. while the preferential cleavage specificities may be useful here, recently identified substrates have shown significant variation in their cleavage sites  <cit> . therefore, the development of computational tools to accurately capture complex sequence patterns and to automate the identification of new cleavage sites would be valuable.

a number of caspase substrate cleavage prediction methods currently exist. the pioneering work began with peptidecutter, a proteases substrates cleavage prediction server for various families of proteases. due to the scarcity of experimental data, peptidecutter was based only on the preferential cleavage specificities of certain caspases  <cit> . lohmuller et al.  <cit>  developed the peptidase substrate prediction tool  based on position specific scoring matrices  for cathepsin b, cathepsin l and caspase- <dig> substrates. while useful, the utility of these tools is limited as they were built on a small dataset of cleavage sites and the cleavage specificities are confined to certain caspases alone, rather than the entire family. in recent years, the exponential discovery and characterization of new substrates and their cleavage sites  <cit>  enabled the development of more effective algorithmic tools. garay-malpartida et al.  <cit>  developed the caspredictor software which exhibited an improvement over previous methods with an accuracy of 81% on a dataset of  <dig> experimentally verified cleavage sites. the caspredictor software uses an algorithm which analyzes the cleavage sites for amino acid substitution, amino acid frequency and the presence of 'pest' sequences  <cit>  in the vicinity of the cleavage site . the grabcas software by backes et al.  <cit>  advanced the previous pssm-based methods by including an updated set of caspase cleavage specificities based on the work by thornberry et al.  <cit> , and observing conservation at p1' and even p2' positions. yang  <cit>  experimented with different neural networks for predicting cleavage sites such as single-layer perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and the bayesian bio-basis function neural networks. they achieved an accuracy of 97% using the bayesian bio-basis function neural network with two gaussian distributions. in the same study, the svm method was tested and was found to give excellent results. however, yang used a small dataset of  <dig> sequences and the method is not available for testing.

in this study, we have developed a support vector machine  system to predict the caspase substrate cleavage sites. first introduced by cortes and vapnik  <cit> , the svm method is a relatively new sub-branch of the machine learning algorithms. svm has been shown to perform well in diverse computational biology applications such as the prediction of protein secondary structure  <cit> ; protein fold  <cit> ; protein quaternary structure  <cit> ; protein homology  <cit> ; protein-protein interaction sites  <cit> ; protein domains  <cit> , hiv protease cleavage sites  <cit>  and t-cell epitopes  <cit> . it is also used in the classification and validation of cancer tissue samples  <cit>  and microarray expression data  <cit> . other applications of svms in biology have been reviewed by byvatov and schneider  <cit> , and yang  <cit> . we have compiled an extensive dataset of unique  cleavage sites to validate the svm method and to further the development of other computational tools. using various statistical metrics, we have shown that the svm method is a rigorous and effective approach for predicting cleavage sites of caspase substrates.

RESULTS
the prediction of caspase substrate cleavage sites is important for our in-depth understanding of the protease-substrate interaction as well as in identifying new caspases substrates. since the publication of the preferential tetrapeptide specificities by thornberry et al.  <cit> , many more caspase substrates have been discovered and the reported cleavage sites have been shown to vary considerably from the preferred sequences  <cit> . artificial intelligence-based techniques such as svm and the neural network are elegant approaches for the extraction of complex patterns from biological sequence data. as the svm methodology was successfully applied in several biological problems, we investigated the utility of the svm approach in predicting the cleavage sites of caspase substrates.

based on the work by fischer et al. and through our own data mining efforts, we have compiled a database of experimentally determined caspase substrates annotated with their cleavage sites. we have obtained a set of  <dig> unique cleavage sites from fischer et al. and  <dig> unique cleavage sites from recently discovered caspase substrates reported in literature but were not detailed in fischer et al. the  <dig> sequences were used for training the svm classifier while the  <dig> sequences were used for testing the effectiveness of the svm method. as there were no experimentally reported non-cleavage sites for caspases, we extracted tetrapeptide sequences at random positions  on experimentally determined caspase substrates. one non-cleavage site was extracted for every cleavage site on the same substrate. the assumption that an intuitively large proportion of tetrapeptide sequences other than the cleavage site on the same substrate should not be recognized and cleaved by caspases justifies the use of these sequences as non-cleavage sites. an equal number of these non-cleavage sites were extracted to match the cleavage sites. together, a primary dataset consisting of the tetrapeptide cleavage sites  and non-cleavage sites  was constructed and designated as the p4p <dig> dataset .

previously, backes et al.  <cit>  and garay-malpartida et al.  <cit>  suggested that residues adjacent to the cleavage site may influence substrate cleavage. backes et al. reported the high occurrence of specific amino acids at p1' for caspase- <dig> and p1' and p2' for granzyme b, a serine protease involved in apoptosis and in immune response  <cit> . garay-malpartida et al. reported that a sizeable proportion of cleavage sites are localized within 'pest' regions, of which have been suggested to label proteins for protease degradation. pest regions are defined as sequence segments enriched with proline , glutamate , aspartate , serine  and threonine  residues  <cit> . therefore, to investigate the influence of the adjacent sequences on substrate cleavage, we further constructed a dataset containing tetrapeptide sequences with the p1' and p2' residues and a dataset containing tetrapeptide sequences flanked by ten residues on either side of the cleavage site. these datasets were designated as p4p2' and p14p10' respectively . the longer sequence segments would encapsulate the information contained in the critical tetrapeptide sequences as well as the p1' and p2' amino acids and other residues adjacent to the cleavage sites.

next, we divided the p4p <dig>  p4p2' and p14p10' datasets into training and test datasets . the training datasets were used for optimizing the svm parameters and for training the svm classifier, while the test datasets were used for evaluating the svm method. we have chosen the rbf kernel which requires parameters γ and c to be optimized. using 10-fold cross-validation, the parameters γ and c were optimized at  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig> . for each of p4p <dig>  p4p2' and p14p10' training datasets, an overall accuracy of  <dig> % was obtained during the cross-validation.

while the reported accuracy on the training datasets may indicate the effectiveness of a prediction method, it may not accurately portray how the method will perform on novel, hitherto undiscovered cleavage sites. therefore, testing the svm methodology on independent out-of-sample datasets, not used in the cross-validation is critical. here, we applied the svm classifiers, trained separately using the entire training datasets from the p4p <dig>  p4p2' and p14p10' datasets with the optimized γ and c parameters, on the respective test datasets and evaluated the results. as shown in table  <dig>  for the p4p <dig> test dataset, the svm method obtained an accuracy of  <dig> % using the rbf kernel with γ =  <dig>  and c =  <dig>  for both the p4p2' and p14p10' test datasets, the svm method obtained an accuracy of  <dig> % using the rbf kernel with γ =  <dig>  and c =  <dig> 

our analysis on the training and test datasets indicated a large percentage of cleavage sites with the xxxd motif  and a very small percentage of cleavage sites with a non-canonical xxxe motif . while experimental cleavage site specificities reported in thornberry et al. suggest most, if not all, sequences to conform to the xxxd motif  <cit> , the inclusion of a large proportion of these sequences in the development of the svm system could lead to over-training of the classifier and confound the results obtained with different sequence representations. to mitigate this possibility, we further constructed datasets identical to p4p <dig>  p4p2' and p14p10' datasets, but with the p <dig> residue removed in all the sequences , p4p2'  and p14p10'  datasets respectively). these datasets were further divided into training and test sets and svm parameters were optimized in the manner as reported for the original p4p <dig>  p4p2' and p14p10' datasets. the trained svm classifiers were tested on the respective test datasets. as shown in table  <dig>  the svm method obtained an accuracy of  <dig> % for the p4p <dig>  test dataset. the performance of the svm improved significantly when tested on p4p2'  and p14p10'  datasets as accuracy readings of  <dig> % and  <dig> % were obtained respectively. while the accuracy on all  test datasets were lower compared to the corresponding original datasets, a larger degree of improvement was observed when the longer sequence representations were used, as evidenced by the greater spread in both the accuracy and sensitivity readings for the p4p <dig>  p4p2'  and p14p10'  datasets. an analysis of the misclassified sequences showed that cleavage sites such as clld <dig> from notch <dig>  and pevd <dig> from p <dig> co-chaperone , which differ markedly from reported tetrapeptide specificities  <cit> , were misclassified by the p4p <dig> -trained svm, but were correctly predicted when the p4p2'  and p14p10'  datasets were used. also, the svm trained with the p4p <dig>  and p4p2'  datasets failed to correctly classify the non-canonical cleavage site vqpe <dig> from diap <dig> , but correctly predicted the cleavage site when trained with the p14p10'  dataset. these results suggest that the svm trained with the  datasets may be useful for identifying hitherto undiscovered cleavage sites while circumventing the problem of overtraining due to the high percentage of "xxxd" cleavage sites in the training datasets. the results also provided further evidence for the suggestion that the p1', p2' and residues further upstream and downstream of the cleavage site may influence substrate cleavage, and by accounting for these flanking sequences, the svm performance can be improved. it was also shown that the svm method can be extended to predict cleavage sites with residues other than the canonical aspartate  at p <dig>  while the occurrence of the non-canonical cleavage sites remains proportionately small, it does imply that the sampling space is not limited to the xxxd motif for cleavage sites. consequently, the ability to predict these non-canonical cleavage sites will be a useful complement to existing computational methods which assumes the consensus xxxd motif as the basis for their algorithms.

as other methods were not readily accessible, we were only able to compare the grabcas method on our datasets. since the grabcas method primarily focuses on the tetrapeptide motif, we have applied it to the p4p <dig> training dataset alone. as the grabcas method can only be applied to potential cleavage sites with aspartate  at the p <dig> position, we scored the positive sequences in the p4p <dig> training dataset with the grabcas matrix values for the different caspases, selected the highest score and checked for the percentage of correctly predicted cleavage sites  against a series of cut-off scores. as shown in table  <dig>  the sensitivity values declined steadily from  <dig> % to  <dig> % as the cutoff values were progressively increased . we have also tested the grabcas method on the positive sequences in the p4p <dig> test dataset. as there were no recommended cut-off scores for predicting the cleavage sites, we chose the cut-off score of  <dig> , which was used for the granzyme b cleavage site prediction as reported in backes et al.  <cit> . at the cut-off score of  <dig> , grabcas predicted only  <dig> out of  <dig> cleavage sites correctly .

finally, to investigate how the svm approach can complement experimental work on caspase substrate cleavage, we applied the svm approach to predict the caspase-mediated cleavage of an anti-apoptotic protein, livin  and its mutant sequences as reported in yan et al.  <cit> , based on the prediction of the caspase cleavage sites. as shown in table  <dig>  the experimental cleavage of wild type human livin and its deletion mutants were compared to the results predicted by the svm trained with the p14p10'  dataset. with the exception of the le Δ52– <dig>  Δ51– <dig> and Δ53– <dig> mutants, all other sequences were correctly predicted to be cleaved or not cleaved by caspases as indicated. for the le Δ52– <dig> and Δ51– <dig> mutants, the flanking sequences upstream and downstream of the cleavage site were likely to have influenced cleavage of the substrates, as predicted by the svm. however, cleavage of substrates was prevented due to the absence of the asp at p <dig> . while the svm predicted the cleavage of Δ53– <dig> mutant, it was proposed by yan et al. that the deleted residues might have led to the distortion of the structure of a neighboring domain or affected its signaling function, which subsequently inhibited the substrate cleavage through downstream signaling. these findings suggest that the svm-based prediction of caspase substrate cleavage sites might be helpful in identifying potential caspase substrates.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we have compiled an extensive dataset of caspase substrates cleavage sites as reported in the literature for the development and validation of other computational tools. we have rigorously tested the svm approach for recognizing the cleavage sites of these substrates. our results show that the svm method is complementary to existing methods, if not more effective. the prediction accuracy can also be improved by accounting for sequences at the p1' and p2' positions and further upstream and downstream of the cleavage site. in addition, the svm method may be useful for predicting the non-canonical cleavage sites lacking aspartate  at the p <dig> position, such as those found in diap <dig> and other proteins as reported in literature  <cit> . as the substrate proteins used in the present method are derived from a variety of organisms  and are cleaved by various caspases , our methodology is applicable to the detection of cleavage sites in substrates from various organisms and is not caspase-specific.

together with existing computational tools, our method will complement on-going experimental efforts in identifying new caspase substrates and further our understanding of the biochemistry of caspase substrate cleavage. this knowledge will be helpful for resolving the larger role of these proteases and their targets in critical processes like apoptosis and inflammation. as more information about caspases and their substrates becomes available, we will update and improve the performance of our methodology.
