BACKGROUND
chondral defects can lead to long term cartilage and bone degeneration, if they are not diagnosed and treated. chondrocytes have a limited capacity for self-repair. damage frequently results in developmental abnormalities or age related degeneration, such as osteoarthritis  <cit> . a current approach for regenerative treatment is autologous chondrocyte implantation   <cit> ; however, this technique is limited by the number of cells available, size of the defects, and the need to maintain fully-differentiated chondrocyte functions.

tissue engineering has been introduced as a treatment for cartilage damage because of its potential to enhance and improve the efficacy of aci. it has been developed for restoring, maintaining, and enhancing tissue or organ function  <cit> ; moreover, culturing isolated cells on biocompatible and biodegradable scaffolds ex vivo can generate tissue for in vivo implantation  <cit> .

a variety of biodegradable polymers have been explored for cartilage repair, such as collagen sponges  <cit> , agarose  <cit> , chondroitin sulfate  <cit>  and silk  <cit> . scaffolds provide a three-dimensional  environment that promotes chondrogenesis, prevents dedifferentiation, and helps in the recovery of the fully-differentiated chondrocyte phenotype, which is lost in a two-dimensional  culture  <cit> . previously, it has been reported that a gelatin-based scaffold  is suitable for use as an in vitro model for chondrocyte 3d culture  <cit> . there are several factors that affect the quality of cartilage generated in tissue culture, including the type of scaffold material used, the quality of the chondrocytes, and the culture media including growth factors  <cit> . in hyaline cartilage, hyaluronan  plays important roles in the skeletal network and provides stability to the extracellular matrix molecules assembling through interaction with other matrix components and chondrocytes. ha promotes chondrocyte proliferation, morphology, and migration, and it provides a controlled environment suitable for cell growth and tissue formation  <cit> . the application of ha for cartilage tissue engineering has been studied. either adding ha into the culture media or exogenous ha-treated scaffolds has been reported to provide positive effects for chondrocyte growth and differentiation  <cit> . in conventional techniques, chondrocytes/scaffolds are cultured in chondrogenic media supplemented with growth factors. tgf-β <dig> is one of the growth factors studied, and it can induce the expression of anabolic chondrogenic gene markers such as α1- collagen type ii  and cartilage oligomeric matrix protein , leading to induction of extracellular matrix production  <cit> . however, large amounts of tgf-β <dig> are needed as frequent media changes require constant replacement.

the scaffold chondrogenic growth factors and biochemical stimuli have been shown to be important factors for cartilage tissue engineering. therefore, this study sought to determine whether a ha/tgf-β <dig> physically immobilized scaffold could retain or enhance chondrogenic properties required for cartilage transplantation better than the scaffold with soluble growth factors. the chondrogenic properties were investigated with primary human articular chondrocyte culture by examining cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production as well as by using scanning electron microscopy and a histological examination. the expression of anabolic chondrogenic genes was also measured over a period of a 21-day cultivation.

RESULTS
amount of tgf-β <dig> and ha in cultivation
the chondrogenic media for the non-adsorbed scaffold control was supplemented with the same amounts of tgf-β <dig>  and ha  as in the conventional method. during the cultivation, the medium was changed every 3 days. thus, the total amounts of tgf-β <dig> and ha used in this soluble control group were 60 ng and 420 μg respectively . this contrasted with the adsorbed scaffold group in which the total amounts of tgf-β <dig> and ha used were only that adsorbed on the scaffold. by using an adsorbed scaffold, the use of tgf-β <dig> and ha was reduced by more than 80%. in order to investigate the release profile of ha and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed to the scaffold, the ha and tgf-β <dig> were quantified in the culture media of controlled incubations . interestingly, more than 90% of the tgf-β <dig> and ha remained on the scaffold after 21 days. the data showed that the gelatin scaffold could adsorb ha and tgf-β <dig>  so that the culture showed only a slow rate of release.table  <dig>

cell proliferation on gelatin scaffolds
the cell viability and proliferation of chondrocytes-cultured scaffolds were determined on days  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  by the alamar blue  assay by comparing the groups of non-adsorbed scaffolds , single factor adsorbed scaffolds , combined factors adsorbed scaffolds  and non-adsorbed scaffolds in medium supplemented with soluble ha and tgf-β <dig> . the results showed that the number of cells on days  <dig> to  <dig> showed some decline in all cultures and were considered to be a lag phase, whereas days  <dig> to  <dig> showed rapid growth, suggesting an exponential or logarithmic phase . the highest survival rate of cells in the cell-seeded soluble control scaffolds was observed earlier on, during days  <dig> to  <dig>  after day  <dig>  the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed higher cell proliferation when compared with soluble control on days  <dig> and  <dig> . only ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds had significantly increased cell proliferation more than the pbs control on days  <dig>  and  <dig> . moreover, increased cell proliferation was observed in cells seeded through the adsorption of ha, ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds, and soluble control scaffolds, but not in tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds. this data suggested that ha could maintain cell proliferation, and the combination of ha and tgf-β <dig> was efficient for enhanced cell proliferation.figure  <dig>

expression of cartilage-specific extracellular matrix biomolecules
the chondrogenic activity of the chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds was assessed by determining the production of a hyaline-like extracellular matrix including ha and s-gag. the cell-free scaffolds were cultured and determined for ha release in order to compare them to the ha production of cell-seeded scaffolds .

for each 3-day interval, the chondrocyte-seeded gelatin scaffolds showed higher levels of ha production and ha release into the media than monolayer cultures . at days  <dig> to  <dig>  the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed significantly increased ha release when compared with monolayer cultures and pbs control. the soluble control showed a significantly higher ha release than that of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds at day  <dig>  and day  <dig> . however in the late period of the cultivation, ha release in the soluble control was significantly lower than that of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds on day  <dig> . the ha in culture media was more significantly increased  in cell-seeded gelatin scaffolds than in monolayer cultures. in the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds, the ha was significantly higher than both pbs control  and soluble control scaffolds . the production and release of s-gag was determined  for each of the 3-day intervals. the levels of s-gag for chondrocyte-seeded soluble control and all types of adsorbed scaffolds were significantly higher than that of monolayer cultures, although there was no difference in the s-gag released on each day amongst these groups . however, the levels of s-gag which accumulated  in adsorbed scaffolds were slightly higher than those in soluble controls. of important note is the observation that the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed the highest accumulation . ha accumulation in the culture media . s-gag released into the culture media at 3-day intervals . s-gag accumulation in the culture media  were measured . *, # p-values are <  <dig> ; **, ## p-values are <  <dig> ; * is a significant amount compared to the pbs control; # is a significant amount compared to the soluble control.



to support this analysis, the process of quantifying the cartilage specific extracellular matrix in cultured scaffolds was performed, including the amounts of ha, s-gag, uronic acid, and collagen content . after the 21-day cultivation, the levels of ecm production of chondrocytes cultured in scaffolds were significantly higher than those found in the monolayer cultures. soluble control and all adsorbed scaffolds showed significantly increased amounts of ha in scaffolds compared to the amounts found in pbs control , and the amounts found in ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds were not different from those in the soluble control. the matrix s-gag content was more abundant in all scaffolds than in monolayer cultures, although the values were not different between the various types of scaffolds .figure  <dig>

the amounts of collagen in soluble control and adsorbed scaffolds were higher than in the pbs control scaffolds , and the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed the highest amounts and were significantly higher than those found in the soluble control .

at the end of the 21-day cultivation, the amount of uronic acid in the matrix was measured. it was found that in soluble control and adsorbed scaffolds, it was significantly higher than in the pbs control ). in addition, ha and ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds had significantly increased levels compared to the level of the soluble control . this extracellular matrix production data suggested that the combination of ha and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed on the gelatin scaffolds had improved efficiency in enhancing cartilage-specific extracellular matrix production when compared to the method of adsorbing ha or tgf-β <dig> alone.

expression of anabolic chondrogenic mrna profile of cells on scaffolds
to test further whether the adsorbed scaffolds demonstrated better potency of chondrogenic properties than non-adsorbed scaffolds, the chondrogenic gene expression was quantified, including sox- <dig> , aggrecan core protein , collagen type ii  and collagen type i  by real-time rt-pcr. the mrna expression levels were monitored on day  <dig> of the 21-day cultivation. sox <dig> expression showed a fall in all cultures from days  <dig> to  <dig> during the rapid proliferation of the cells and remained decreased until the end of the cultivation. however, the expression in ha, ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed and soluble control scaffolds on day  <dig> was significantly higher than in the pbs control scaffolds  . on day  <dig>  the sox <dig> expression in all adsorbed scaffolds and soluble control scaffolds was higher than in the pbs control, but this was not significant. however, at day  <dig>  the ha and ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed significantly increased sox <dig> expression when compared to the expression in the soluble control . aggrecan  expression also paralleled some of the changes in sox <dig> , but comparisons showed that the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds had a marked-up regulation of acan expression at day  <dig> and day  <dig> when compared to that of the pbs control  and the soluble control . this correlated with the sox <dig> expression at these same time intervals. on day  <dig>  the level of acan expression in all adsorbed scaffolds and soluble control scaffolds was significantly higher than in the pbs control . as for collagen type ii , the expression did not follow the pattern shown for sox <dig> and acan, and there was no decrease shown from days  <dig> to  <dig>  at day  <dig>  the expression of col2a <dig> in the chondrocyte-seeded adsorbed scaffolds and soluble control was significantly higher than in the pbs control ). only the expression in the tgf-β <dig> and ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds were significantly higher than in the soluble control on day  <dig> . all of the adsorbed scaffolds showed an increase of col2a <dig> expression after the 7-day interval while that of the pbs control decreased.figure  <dig>

furthermore, an investigation was made into the ratio of collagen type ii  to collagen type i  gene expression as a measure of chondrocyte phenotype . all gelatin scaffolds showed higher ratios of col2a <dig> to col1a <dig> than in monolayer cultures. the ratio was at its highest on day  <dig> and decreased at day  <dig>  the ratio measured in chondrocyte-seeded ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds was significantly higher than that of the pbs control and soluble control at both day  <dig> and  <dig> 

histology examination of chondrocytes cultured on scaffolds
the cell penetration and morphology of chondrocyte-seeded scaffolds by hematoxylin & eosin staining was determined in this study . the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed plentiful cell penetration and growth in both the edge  and porous areas . the ha adsorbed scaffolds showed less cell distribution than that of the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds. the other scaffold types, including the pbs control, soluble control, and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds, showed less cell growth and distribution within the scaffolds.figure  <dig>

to determine the extracellular matrix production, scaffolds were stained with safranin o for glycosaminoglycans and with immunohistochemistry for collagen type ii . the results showed that the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds had higher amounts of safranin o staining when compared to the amounts in the other scaffolds with the same observation of collagen type ii intensity .

the results showed that the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds were the best at enhancing cell proliferation and extracellular matrix production.

scanning electron microscopic examination
to assess cell morphology and cell distribution further, a scanning em was used on scaffolds at the end of the 21-day cultivation. this examination showed that there was a complete filling of the extracellular matrix formation in the pores of both soluble control and ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds . the surface of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds were also covered with the chondrocytes embedded in extracellular matrix. the chondrocytes showed a spherical morphology comparable with a previous study  <cit> . the surface of the soluble control scaffolds was smoother than that of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds, and the distinct cell morphology could not be observed.figure  <dig>

tgf-β <dig> released over 21 days in culture media
the release of tgf-β <dig> in culture media of tgf-β <dig> and ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds was quantified and compared. figure 7a shows that the amount of tgf-β <dig> released from the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds was lower than from the tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds at day  <dig>  furthermore, the accumulated amount of tgf-β <dig> released into the culture media of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds was lower than that of the tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds  . the results suggested that the gelatin scaffolds retained much of the tgf-β <dig> over the 21 days because the amount released was much less than  <dig> percent of the amount of tgf-β <dig> used in the adsorbed solution .figure  <dig>

discussion
gelatin is a natural polymer that has been used in cartilage tissue engineering and for cell delivery in cartilage regeneration  <cit> . it is derived from collagen and is suitable because of its lack of antigenicity and retainment of some informational signals, such as the rdg sequence, which can promote cell adhesion, differentiation, proliferation  <cit> , and ecm deposition  <cit> . absorbable haemostatic porcine gelatin scaffolds, commercially available as spongostan®, were obtained from johnson & johnson . they are medical devices used for haemostatic surgical procedures. they are recommended as being a suitable 3d matrix for chondrocytes  <cit>  in order to reduce dedifferentiation of the cells in vitro and to stabilize the chondrocyte phenotype.

even though ha-adsorbed gelatin  scaffolds  <cit>  and tgf-β <dig> supplementation in chondrogenic media  <cit>  have previously been investigated for cartilage tissue engineering, this study worked on the new development of combining the effect of both adsorbed exogenous ha and tgf-β <dig> on chondrocytes in a 3d culture model. this study demonstrated for the first time that the combination of ha and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed on gelatin scaffolds enhanced the extracellular matrix production and chondrogenic specific gene markers of the embedded primary human chondrocytes.

in this work, gelatin scaffolds were used to mimic a natural extracellular matrix by adsorbing to it the key biomolecules, ha and tgf-β <dig>  this provides a novel factor delivery technique, the adsorption method. the gelatin scaffolds have the ability to enhance cell adhesion and growth by sustaining the release of growth factors  <cit> , which help to simplify the cartilage tissue regeneration process. moreover, the amount of the stimulating factors and thereby the costs involved become 80% less by using adsorbed scaffold cultures over conventional media supplements.

previous studies on tgf-β <dig> suggest that a dose of 10 ng seems to be sufficient to enhance chondrogenesis in 2d and 3d in vitro cultures  <cit> . a scaffold control was performed to determine the amount of ha and tgf-β <dig> released. the data showed that after day  <dig> of cultivation, the amount of tgf-β <dig> remained at more than  <dig> percent of the dose used in the scaffold adsorption process .

gelatin scaffolds were evaluated for 3d chondrocyte cultures for in vitro hyaline cartilage tissue regeneration, which used primary human articular chondrocytes. the cell proliferation, extracellular matrix biomolecule content, and histological analysis were designed to determine the effects of ha and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed gelatin scaffolds on chondrocyte ecm synthesis over the course of the 21-day cultivation. primarily, at the early stage of cultivation, there was some decline in cell numbers as the cells adapted to being on the matrix, but in comparison with the soluble control scaffolds, the combined adsorbed scaffolds provided the highest cell retention rates . at later stages of cultivation, ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds tended to increase in cell proliferation more than other types , whereas the proliferation of cells in soluble control and ha adsorbed scaffolds were lower. these results correspond with previous studies that showed ha to effectively promote chondrocyte proliferation  <cit> . because ha is a major component of ecm produced by chondrocytes, it provides an appropriate environment for cell attachment and cell proliferation. chondrocytes bind to ha via cd44-ha receptor interactions and activate cd <dig> signaling pathways that play a role in the proliferation of chondrocytes  <cit> . although previous studies  <cit>  show that tgf-β <dig> stimulates cell proliferation, this study, in contrast, found that tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds could not promote cell proliferation as well as control scaffolds . however, ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed and soluble control scaffolds had higher cell proliferation rates than ha adsorbed scaffolds. these observations indicated that cell attachment via ha may provide better access to tgf-β <dig>  thus allowing tgf-β <dig> to enhance ha function, and possibly, ha might retain tgf-β <dig> on the scaffold which enhances chondrocyte functions. these results correlated with the h&e staining that took place after the 21-day cultivation . the staining showed large numbers of cells in the pores and on the surface of ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds. in cartilage tissue engineering, cell proliferation  is important to achieve tissue regeneration  <cit> . since chondrocytes were used as the primary cells in this study, any small increase in their proliferation might be meaningful data for ecm production.

this study demonstrated that chondrocytes seeded in the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds expressed chondrogenic-specific extracellular matrix biomolecules, including ha, collagen, and uronic acid more than chondrocytes cultured in other types of gelatin scaffolds. ha not only promotes cell adhesion and proliferation, but also provides positive effects on chondrocyte differentiation  <cit> . in addition, tgf-β <dig> can induce cell differentiation by stimulating the expression of anabolic chondrogenic gene markers, leading to extracellular matrix production  <cit> . according to the safranin o and collagen type ii staining , ha and tgf-β <dig> enhance extracellular matrix production.

the expression of chondrogenic genes on days  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of cultivation were also examined. on day  <dig>  chondrocytes cultured in ha, ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed, and soluble control scaffolds expressed higher levels of sox <dig> and acan than those cultured in pbs control. and on day  <dig>  the decreased expressions of these two genes were observed. the sox <dig> transcription factor plays a role in the induction and retainment of the chondrogenic phenotype and cartilaginous matrix formation  <cit> . it is also known to regulate the expression of acan  <cit>  and col2a <dig>  <cit>  genes, which encode important cartilage-specific matrix proteins. nevertheless, both chondrocytes seeded in all of the adsorbed gelatin scaffolds and in the soluble control scaffolds showed an increase in the amount of col2a <dig> expression on day  <dig>  which occurred after the decrease of the sox <dig> expression on day  <dig>  these results indicate that col2a <dig> is under the regulation of other factors besides sox <dig>  on days  <dig> and  <dig> of cultivation, the chondrocytes that were seeded in all of the adsorbed scaffolds and in the soluble control expressed higher levels of col2a <dig> expression than the chondrocytes in the pbs control group, and moreover, chondrocytes cultured in ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffold groups showed the highest expression overall. a ratio of col2a <dig> to col1a <dig> is generally used for assessment of chondrocyte phenotypic stability. the col2a1/col1a <dig> ratio of chondrocytes seeded in ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds and in the soluble control was significantly higher than the ratio in the pbs control group on day  <dig>  on day  <dig> of cultivation, the col2a1/col1a <dig> ratio of chondrocytes cultured in ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds was higher than in the soluble control group. the previous studies demonstrated that type ii collagen gene expression level in native cartilage was markedly higher than in cultured chondrocytes, besides type i collagen gene expression was markedly increased in culture compared to intact cartilage  <cit> . moreover, they found that type ii collagen gene expression exhibited decrease during monolayer cultivation  <cit> . these evidences indicated that the col2a1/col1a <dig> ratio was extremely low in chondrocyte cultivation when compares to intact cartilage. corresponding to our study, the col2a1/col1a <dig> ratio of the cultured chondrocytes was very low in monolayer culture and it was elevated by cultivation in scaffold, however, still lower than in intact cartilage.

these observations suggest that the ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed gelatin scaffolds support dedifferentiation less than and enhance re-differentiation more than the chondrocytes in the monolayer cultures, and therefore, it indicates that they have potential to stabilize the chondrocyte phenotype. these results also indicate that ha and tgf-β <dig> have anabolic effects on chondrocytes as presented in previous studies  <cit> . they have these effects by promoting the expression of chondrogenic gene markers. interestingly, ha and tgf-β <dig> showed a synergistic effect on the retention of chondrogenic properties including enhanced anabolic chondrogenic gene expressions and cartilage matrix proteins production, including ha, proteoglycan, collagen, and uronic acid.

the soluble control scaffolds induced chondrocyte proliferation, ecm production, and chondrogenic anabolic gene expression only during the early period of cultivation. moreover, these scaffolds showed large amounts of cell proliferation only on the surface of the scaffolds  but not in the pores of the scaffolds. these observations indicate that soluble ha and tgf-β <dig> mainly enhance cell proliferation and ecm production of chondrocytes around surface of scaffold, whereas ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffold may induce those in both surface and inside pore of scaffold. secondly, because the ecm was abundantly produced and tightly covered the scaffolds, tgf-β <dig> and ha were not able to pass through the ecm layer in order to maintain the chondrocyte function inside the scaffolds.

furthermore, there was evidence that ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds had higher rates of tgf-β <dig> retainment than those of tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds. thus, ha in ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds may be what retains the growth factor tgf-β <dig> within the scaffolds and helps present the fiber network of ha and tgf-β <dig> in order to interact and enhance the chondrocyte functions  <cit> . evidence suggests that in vivo tgf-β <dig> has a short half-life and may be degraded by proteases and elastases at sites of inflammation  <cit> . it is possible that tgf-β <dig> in the adsorbed scaffolds might be degraded after 21 days. however, in this study, ha and tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds showed more efficiency in supporting chondrocyte functions and cartilage matrix regeneration than soluble control scaffolds, which were supplemented with fresh ha and tgf-β <dig>  ha is glycosaminoglycan, it has viscous properties, is highly hydrated, and is non-immunogenic. accordingly, ha has an important physical function. ha maintains the viscosity of interstitial fluid in connective tissue  <cit> , controls water transport  <cit> , and provides protective physiochemical functions. exogenous ha suppresses the production and activity of matrix metalloproteinases and pro-inflammatory mediators. therefore, ha has been explored as a drug delivery agent for several target tissues  <cit> . this study supports the idea that ha could help retain tgf-β <dig> as a drug delivery agent in gelatin scaffolds.

many previous studies have reported the comparison between 2d and 3d culture methods on chondrogenic phenotype and cartilage tissue regeneration  <cit> . 2d monolayer cultivation has not maintained chondrogenic differentiation gene markers, including sox <dig>  acan, and col2a <dig>  this corresponds with a lower expression of cartilage extracellular matrix than what is seen in 3d cultivation. in contrast, 3d cultivation is accepted as the way to help maintain the chondrocyte phenotype by increasing both the chondrogenic mrna and extracellular matrix expression. scaffolds provide a 3d environment in which cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions are promoted, and they are likely to be an important factor for chondrocyte functions in cartilage regeneration.

CONCLUSIONS
chondrocyte dedifferentiation occurs in routine cultivation of 2d monolayer culture, and 3d culture can be used to retain chondrogenic phenotypes. in this study, a functional scaffold was developed based on a novel strategy that enhances redifferentiation and promotes matrix production in 3d culture. an investigation into this scaffold design has shown that ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed scaffolds are suitable for supporting chondrocyte expansion and the enhancement of extracellular matrix production, including ha, s-gag, uronic acid, and collagen. in addition, this functional scaffold gives improved expression of anabolic chondrogenic genes, including sox <dig>  acan, and col2a <dig>  when compared to the control groups. since ha and tgf-β <dig> show a synergistic effect on the induction of chondrogenic properties when adsorbed onto ha + tgf-β <dig> adsorbed gelatin scaffolds, it is believed that these scaffolds may offer advantages as regenerative cartilage tissue models for in vitro 3d human chondrocyte culture.
