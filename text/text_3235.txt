BACKGROUND
since the discovery of transposable elements  by barbara mcclintock in maize  <cit> , the origins, roles, and regulation of tes have been subject to tremendous interest. while tes are ubiquitous in all organisms  <cit> , their contribution to genome size can change rapidly during evolution. in plants, tes are defined as two main classes depending on their transposition mechanisms  <cit> . class i elements transpose via rna intermediates, during which the rna transcripts of a chromosomally integrated copy are used as templates to make dna , and are then inserted into the host genome by the action of integrase or endonuclease components  <cit> . these tes are not excised during transposition, which leads to an increase in copy numbers in the host genome. class i tes include retrotransposons with long terminal repeats , such as copia, gypsy and non-ltr retrotransposons. the class ii tes transpose via dna intermediates, which include ac/ds,en/spm, and mutator elements, and have mainly been associated with maize  <cit> .

in some species, tes have caused up to two-fold differences in genome size that sometimes arose over only a few million years  <cit> . these rapid fluctuations, which may be due to tes being either more active or more efficiently deleted in different species, indicate that the control of tes can differ greatly between closely related plant species . tes are often regarded as genomic “parasites” due to the potentially detrimental effects on genes by insertional inactivation and ectopic recombination of dna  <cit> .

to better understand te behavior in plants it may be useful to study closely related plant species that span the speciation continuum and that have characteristic biogeographic histories  <cit> . the oryza clade, consisting of  <dig> species along an evolutionary gradient of about  <dig> million years, may work as models for plant genome research and te evolution . such studies may be well suited to improve rice quality, which is of pivotal significance to worldwide food production and security  <cit> . many genes that have led to rice improvement are derived from wild rice aa-genome species, and much attention has been directed on broadening the gene pool of cultivated rice through introgression of other wild relatives of oryza  <cit> . phylogenetic analysis of the diploid aa-genome species, i.e., o. sativa japonica, o. sativa indica, o. nivara, o. rufipogon, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula and o. meridionalis, indicated that a closely spaced series of recent speciation events in this genus has occurred  <cit> . these species span a wide range of global pantropical geographical regions and are disjunctively distributed in asia, africa, australia, and south america  <cit> . having diverged approx.  <dig> mya from a common aa-genome ancestor  <cit> , these eight species have contributed extensive adaptive and breeding traits  <cit> .

the oryza aa-genome species contains eight diploid species, including two cultivated species oryza sativa l. ssp. japonica and oryza glamberrima steud.  <cit> . in general, o. sativa is grown in china and other asia-pacific regions, and has two subspecies, o. sativa japonica and o. sativa l. ssp. indica  <cit> . by comparison, o. sativa japonica is an important model species of monocot plants and cereals  <cit> . oryza rufipogon griff. and oryza nivara are widely recognized as the direct ancestors of asian cultivated rice  . in particular, o. rufipogon is perennial, photoperiod sensitive, largely cross-fertilized and widely distributed from the southern china, south and southeast asia to papua new guinea and northern australia. it grows perennially in areas around water such as swamps and lakes  <cit> . in contrast, as a wild rice from india, o. nivara is an annual, photoperiod insensitive and predominantly self-fertilized species. this species is restricted to south, and mainland southeast, asia in the diverse areas such as swampy lands, edges of ponds and tanks, beside streams, ditches, in or around rice fields  <cit> . o. glaberrima, a west african species of cultivated rice, was independently domesticated about 3000 years ago in the niger river delta. it has significant resistance to many pests and diseases and tolerance to drought and poor soils, but lacks many of important agronomic traits compared with asian rice  <cit> . furthermore, oryza longistaminata and oryza barthii are the progenitors of o. glaberrima  <cit> . o. barthii is normally found in mopane, savanna woodland, savanna and fadama, and prefers to grow in clay or black cotton soils  <cit> . oryza glumaepatula and oryza meridionalis are the aa-genome diploid wild rice found in latin america and australia, respectively. o. glumaepatula grows in deep and sometimes flowing water, whereas o. meridionalis is found at edges of freshwater lagoons, temporary pools, and swamps in 15–20 cm of water  <cit> .

in this study, we used these closely related rice species to map the te distributions in their genomes. we found that tes are depleted from genomic regions that are associated with genes in cultivated rice species. in addition, common genes and gene families are associated with, or devoid of, tes in the cultivated species, suggesting that domestication has affected te distribution similarly in these species despite a relatively distant evolutionary history.

RESULTS
evolutionary relationships of eight rice aa genomes
to confirm the evolutionary relationship between the eight rice species, we performed phylogenomic analyses of  <dig> orthologous and single-copy genes of at least  <dig> aa from the eight fully sequenced oryza genomes, using o. meridionalis as out-group . gene-based phylogenetic relationships clearly supported global genome divergences of the species. the general nucleotide substitution rate has been estimated to  <dig>  × 10− <dig> substitutions per site per year  <cit> , which we used to date the speciation events. we found the major extant aa lineages to be within  <dig>  million years , in agreement with other analyses of sequence divergence times for rice  <cit> .fig.  <dig> comparative genomics of the eight aa-genome oryza species. a phylogenetic relationship of the eight aa-genome oryza species inferred from orthologous gene sequences. estimates of divergence time  are given at each node , all supported with 100% bootstrap values. b comparative genome analysis. each line in the circle represents one of the  <dig> chromosomes of oryza genomes, along with the number of all tes  and tes in genes . and the slide window size is  <dig>  bp. c blown-up image of chr <dig> for six of the rice species




tes are larger and occupy more genomic space in cultivated rice as compared to wild relatives
cultivated rice cultivars have larger genome sequences, and typically have more genes and transcripts, as compared to their closest wild relatives  . to investigate whether the number and sizes of tes vary among these species we employed a homology-based search of a te library as query sequences. more specifically, we used repeatmasker to perform de novo homology search for tes of the rice genomes . we refer to the obtained segments as tes, but it is noteworthy that many of them were short te fragments. figures  <dig> and  <dig> show the distribution, and the length and copy numbers of tes in the rice genomes, respectively. these data revealed that  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the genome sequences consist of tes, which corresponds to approximately  <dig>  million tes . notably,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> % of the genomes of o. sativa japonica, o. rufipogon, o. sativa indica, o. nivara, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula and o. meridionalis, consisted of tes, respectively , indicating that a relatively larger fraction of the genomes of the three cultivated rice species consisted of tes as compared to their close wild relatives. the majority of these were ltr elements, followed by dna transposons and lines . the ltr elements contributed  <dig> to  <dig> mbp  of the cultivated rice genomes, while only  <dig> to  <dig> mbp  of the wild rice genomes. a complete list of the contribution of different te classes to the genomic te content is outlined in the supplemental material .table  <dig> the sequenced genomes of the eight oryza species in this study

the tes also contributed larger blocks of sequence in cultivated rice than that in their wild relatives . for example, gypsy ltr elements were typically two times longer in sequence in cultivated asian rice species as compared to their closest wild rice species . however, the copy number of these specific tes did not strictly follow this trend . nevertheless, our results indicated that tes contribute a larger part of the genome sequences, and were longer in sequence, in cultivated rice species as compared to their close wild relatives .

tes are selectively excluded from gene regions in cultivated rice
to assess whether the tes were associated with specific genomic regions, we analyzed whether there were any differences in te distribution among genes in the rice genomes. we defined a gene as a continuous exon and intron sequence, including the predicted surrounding untranslated regions. we mapped the tes onto the rice genomes and observed that at least 10% of tes occurred in such gene regions . surprisingly, the three cultivated rice species contained substantially lower numbers of tes associated with genes as compared to their closest wild rice species . while the cultivated species only contained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the total tes inserted in gene regions, the related wild relatives contained  <dig>  to  <dig> % of their tes in genes . for example, of the total gypsy tes only  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the copies were in gene regions of the cultivated rice species while between  <dig>  to  <dig> % of the total gypsy te copies were in corresponding regions of the wild rice species . we found that the major tes in the gene regions were dna transposons, while tes in intergenic regions were often ltr retrotransposons. moreover, we also counted the numbers of tes within 2 kbps upstream and downstream of the genes . notably, these regions did not contain any substantial differences in tes, i.e., similar levels of tes were found in these regions both in the cultivated and in the wild rice species . nevertheless, some tes, including the ltr tes, showed tendencies to occupy these areas differently in the different rice species. to estimate whether the te content is lower in gene regions than expected by chance we compared the observed numbers with random te occupations based on the te content in the respective rice genomes. we found strong significant support for lower levels of tes associated with genes in the cultivated vs wild rice species . these findings indicate that the cultivated rice species deprive tes from their gene regions, and suggest that tes may promote certain environmental adaptations of genes in their wild rice relatives.fig.  <dig> gene regions contain lower amounts of tes as compared to their wild relatives. a pie charts showing the relative distributions of tes associated with genes, and upstream and downstream gene regions. note that the gene regions in the domesticated species contain relatively less tes as compared to their wild relatives. such differences are not evident in the upstream and downstream regions of the genes. b

tes are preferentially present in introns of expressed genes
to investigate how the tes affected gene functions, we examined gene expression levels by cufflinks using fpkm  from rna sequencing data  of seven of the eight rice species . we defined a gene with fpkm values greater than zero as expressed, otherwise the gene was referred to as non-expressed. the rna-seq data were obtained from leaves, roots and panicles, and many genes will therefore not be called expressed due to tissue/cell type specific expression. we took note of this during our subsequent analyses and for our conclusions. as a result,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the genes in o. sativa japonica, o. rufipogon, o. nivara, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula and o. meridionalis, respectively, was referred to as expressed in leaves, panicles and roots . we next assessed whether these genes were associated with tes. we found that  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> of the expressed genes have tes associated with the gene regions in o. sativa japonica, o. rufipogon, o. nivara, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula and o. meridionalis, respectively . notably, we observed that expressed genes typically contain tes in their introns rather than in exons . for example, o. sat japonica only has  <dig> tes in exons, whereas  <dig> tes are in introns, of its expressed genes . this is almost a 34-fold difference in te distribution within the gene regions of expressed genes, and is substantially more than what is expected by chance . in contrast, the numbers of tes in introns or exons were almost equal for the genes referred to as non-expressed . these data indicate that, at least in leaves, panicles and roots of rice species, intronic rather than exonic tes are associated with expressed genes. these data support that tes are an unwanted feature in exons that may cause deleterious effects on gene function and/or expression.fig.  <dig> tes are preferentially located to intronic gene regions. a expressed genes with or without tes. b numbers of tes in expressed or not expressed genes based on rna-seq transcriptomic data




tes have been selectively retained in genes associated with certain functions in cultivated rice species
to investigate if the tes preferentially affected genes of certain functions, we performed gene ontology  enrichment analyses . we first performed go analyses for genes that contain tes in their promoter regions , within the gene coding regions and  <dig> kbp downstream for the rice species . interestingly, different sets of go terms were significantly enriched for tes in the three regions for cultivated vs wild rice species, respectively. that is, the three cultivated species o. sativa, o. indica and o. glaberrima all contained a very similar set of go terms that were affected by tes, e.g., go terms such as “cell wall”, “flower development” and “cell death” . likewise, the wild rice species displayed their own set of go terms affected by tes, including the go terms “response to biotic stimuli” and “kinase activity”. we next assessed whether genes, and upstream and downstream gene regions, that are devoid of tes also showed similar gos among the cultivated vs. wild rice species, respectively. indeed, also here we found that the cultivated rice species had common go terms significantly enriched, including the terms “plastids” and “thylakoids” . likewise, the wild rice species also had similar go terms enriched among themselves for the investigated genomic regions, e.g., “response to endogenous stimulus” and “chromatin binding”. these data indicate that tes have become enriched  in genes of certain functions depending on domestication.

we next assessed whether the genes in the enriched go terms are close homologs, i.e., if the genes included in a certain go term are closely related genes for the cultivated rice vs their wild relatives. surprisingly, we found that many of the genes associated with any given enriched go term represented close homologs across the cultivated rice species. for example, tes were absent in the last exon region of closely related genes in cultivated rice, but present in wild rice, of the go term go: <dig> . two such examples are illustrated in fig.  <dig>  in which gene coding regions  of close gene homologs in wild rice  contained tes , whereas the closest homologs in the cultivated rice species  did not. since the wild rice species have a pairwise evolutionary relationship with the cultivated species, i.e., the o. sativa japonica is more closely related to o. rufipogon than to o. sativa indica , these data suggest either a similar change in the coding regions of genes in the cultivated rice species , or an independent loss or gain of the tes in the cultivated and wild rice species, respectively. notably, the gene structures are supported by rna-seq data . nevertheless, the domestication appears to have led to convergent evolution of coding regions of genes, and/or te content and positions in rice species.fig.  <dig> pair-wise comparisons of gene structure and te locations of two examples within go: <dig>  a loc_os07g <dig> gene. b loc_os02g <dig> gene




tes may affect gene functions that are central to growth and traits differently in cultivated vs wild rice species
emergence, extinction and alterations of genes within closely related organisms can lead to species adaptation and lineage evolution  <cit> . to assess whether the tes may contribute to important traits in cultivated rice, we first assigned o. sativa japonica, o. sativa indica, o. nivara, o. rufipogon, o. glaberrima, o. barthii, o. glumaepatula and o. meridionalis protein sequences to orthomcl families, and identified  <dig>  orthologous gene families  comprising  <dig> genes. we compared the asian  and african  cultivated rice to their closest ancestor wild rice, and analyzed the location of tes in gene families associated with important traits in peer-reviewed publications. we found that both regulatory proteins  and metabolic proteins  had much reduced numbers of tes in their gene coding regions in cultivated rice species as compared to their wild relatives . the corresponding proteins may partake in starch , cell wall hemicellulose  synthesis, storage  and seed imbibition  processes, or be involved in chloroplast carboxylation  and sugar transport . other protein families were associated with biotic or abiotic stress tolerance  or signalling pathways . in summary, protein families that are important for rice development and growth are affected by tes differently in cultivated and wild rice species.table  <dig> examples of gene families that are known to be associated with traits in rice and their tes insertions numbers

to illustrate how the tes might affect specific genes that have been shown to directly affect important rice traits, we inspected several gene regions related to grain development. the rice cell-wall invertase  gene gif <dig>  controls grain-filling, yield  <cit>  and seed size  <cit>  in rice, and domestication might have changed its promoter region that affected gif <dig> expression  <cit> . we found that both the gene coding region and the promoter  contained tes in the cultivated and the wild rice species . notably, sequence alignment and annotation of the orthologous genomic regions for the eight rice species revealed conserved gene colinearity and structure in the gif <dig> region, but the te content and positions clearly differed . this includes many class ii tes that were present in the promoter regions of the gif <dig> in the wild rice relatives. these tes might therefore affect either alternative splicing or changes in expression of the gif <dig> locus, which may contribute to the grain-filling capacity in the rice species.fig.  <dig> comparisons of gene structure and te locations of gif <dig> gene critical for grain filling in the eight rice species. organization of exons, introns and tes of gif <dig>  gene in gene body and 2-kbp flanking sequences of the gene. seed images of ancestral wild rice and cultivated rice are shown to the right





another gene that is important for seed development in rice is the bh <dig>   <cit> , which encodes an amino acid transporter. this gene is key to explain the transition from the black-colored seed hull of the ancestral wild rice to the straw-white seed hull of cultivated rice during grain ripening  <cit> . the straw-white hull was selected as an important visual phenotype of non-shattered grains during rice domestication. a 22-bp deletion within exon  <dig> of the bh <dig> disrupted the gene function, leading to straw-white hull in several cultivated rice species  <cit> . interestingly, this exon is affected by a mule-mudr dna transposon in o. sativa that must have caused an alternative splice variant of bh <dig> in this rice species . in o. sativa japonica, part of the mule-mudr was transcribed as exon  <dig> , although the other seven rice species also had this mule-mudr, transcription bypassed this transposon . nevertheless, these data support an important role of tes in the selection of rice species during domestication.fig.  <dig> comparison of gene structure and te locations of bh <dig> gene critical for grain filling in the eight rice species. organization of exons, introns and tes of bh <dig>  gene in gene body and 2-kbp flanking sequences of the gene. a blown-up image of bh <dig> gene structure of o. sativa japonica is shown above the main image. this mutation changed the black-colored seed hull of the ancestral wild rice to the straw-white seed hull of cultivated rice




discussion
tes are important genomic components that may underpin rapid evolutionary processes in various organisms . using three cultivated and their close wild rice species, we have delineated the genomic content and distribution of tes, which revealed that tes tend to be devoid from gene coding regions and affect different sets of genes in the cultivated species despite a more distant evolutionary relationship compared to their close wild rice relatives.

our study reveals two major and surprising findings;  <dig>  gene regions in the cultivated species are devoid of tes, and  <dig>  genes of certain functions tend to be similarly affected by tes in cultivated species, but different in wild rice species. it is plausible that the cultivated species have been selected to maintain certain features, including stable expression of trait-related genes, and that this is the underlying factor behind the tes distributions. indeed, we found that the wild rice species contained more tes in their gene regions, mainly associated with intronic regions, which could affect expression levels and alternative splicing of genes that may be detrimental to important traits in cultivated species. for instance, many te mutations are harmful to seed yields  <cit> . on the other hand, an association of tes with the gene regions, as that observed in the wild rice species, might allow for plasticity of gene expression and could perhaps also affect chromatin features, including euchromatin and heterochromatin regions  <cit> . in contrast to the gene regions, we found that both cultivated and wild rice species have similar copy numbers of tes in their 0-2kbp upstream, or downstream of genes, indicating that these tes may not have been as affected during domestication/selection of cultivated rice, and perhaps affect gene functions less than their gene-located counterparts. interestingly, in at least some of the cases where we investigated how certain tes affected loci in more detail, we found that the coding regions sometimes had changed in a converging fashion in the cultivated species. these changes could to some degree also explain why the gene regions in our analyses were associated with fewer tes in these species. while we confirmed the changed gene structures with rna-seq data, it is noteworthy that the cultivated species are better annotated as compared to the wild rice species and so some differences in gene coding regions may also be due to poor annotation.

the fact that tes affected genes that are closely related differently in the cultivated vs the wild rice species underscores the importance of maintaining certain functions stable in the cultivated species  <cit> . the most likely scenario for why this has occurred may be that the domestication and subsequent selection of rice has slowly led to depletion of tes from genes that underpin important traits in rice. we exemplified some of these genes, for example the gif <dig> locus, which support our hypothesis that the tes may influence loci that encode important rice traits . the similar te distributions in cultivated rice may therefore be a domesticated evolutionary convergence of te locations  <cit> . in other words, we interpret that the domestication process of rice has primarily affected the genomic distribution of tes, and that certain rice traits are better maintained based on the te distribution patterns. hence, our findings have provided insights into te-dependent rice traits and suggest potential strategies for genetically engineering of rice.

it is important to note that because we have analyzed one accession per species  it might be difficult to conclude how many tes are truly missing and/or present in any of the species. however, we assume that the accessions we chose are representative for the different species. nevertheless, any minor discrepancies in te distribution based on this would not impact on the overall message of this study. hence, cultivation of rice has led to a general te depletion from genes and to a selection-based evolutionary convergence in terms of gene functions affected by tes.

CONCLUSIONS
tes are important genomic landmarks of genetic variation, and different types of tes, as well as their physical location and abundance, provide for insights into genome evolution. this study has demonstrated that domestication of rice has primarily impacted the genomic distribution of tes and that certain rice traits are closely associated with te distribution patterns. the results have provided insights into te-dependent rice traits and indicated the potential to genetically engineer rice for high seed yields and biomass production.
