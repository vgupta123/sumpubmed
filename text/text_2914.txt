BACKGROUND
a bacterial cell-to-cell communication mechanism, quorum sensing, is a regulatory process that utilises small, diffusible signal molecules to modulate specific gene expression in a population density-dependent manner  <cit> . diverse gram-negative bacteria can synthesise n-acyl-homoserine lactones  as quorum-sensing signal molecules by means of luxi-type ahl synthases  <cit> . these quorum-sensing signal molecules share identical homoserine lactone moieties but vary in length or the carbon substitution on the third position on the acyl side chain. as the population density increases, the ahls bind to luxr transcriptional regulators; then, the luxr/ahl complexes regulate the expression of the target genes. the ahl-mediated quorum sensing mechanisms are highly conserved and could regulate infections and virulence factors in several human and plant pathogenic bacteria, such as chromobacterium violaceum, burkholderia cepacia, erwinia carotovora, brucella melitensis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> . recently, the ahl-mediated quorum-sensing systems have been viewed as new targets for anti-infective therapies. in contrast to traditional drug designs that are either bactericidal or bacteriostatic, the disruption of the ahl-mediated quorum sensing mechanisms, known as quorum quenching, aims to shut down the expression of virulence rather than to kill the organisms. therefore, quorum quenching has the potential to overcome drug related toxicities, complicating superinfections, and antibiotic resistance in antibiotic therapy  <cit> .

there are several quorum-quenching strategies available for disrupting the ahl-based quorum-sensing microorganisms, including the enzymatic inactivation of ahl molecules and the inhibition of ahl synthesis by triclosans  <cit> . another strategy is to block the formation of luxr/ahl complexes by using halogenated furanones  <cit> . however, the major quorum-quenching approach for controlling ahl-regulated disease focuses on the ahl-lactonases and ahl-acylases  <cit> . ahl-acylases degrade ahls by hydrolysing the amide linkages between the fatty acid chain and the homoserine lactone moiety  <cit> . to date, only five ahl-acylase genes, i.e. aiid in ralstonia sp xj12b  <cit> , ahlm in streptomyces sp. m <dig>  <cit> , pvdq and quip in p. aeruginosa pao <dig>  <cit> , and aiic in anabaena sp. pcc <dig>  <cit>  have been identified.

interestingly, the human opportunistic pathogen p. aeruginosa pao <dig> produces two major ahls, including n--homoserine lactone  and n-butanoyl-homoserine lactone   <cit> , as well as an ahl-acylase pvdq; this seemingly different from the common single set of the luxi/luxr homologue system. p. aeruginosa pao <dig> possesses a more complex hierarchical ahl mediated quorum-sensing mechanism that is composed of two sets of luxi/luxr homologues, termed lasr/lasi and rhlr/rhli systems  <cit> . these systems are first operated by 3oc12-hsl and c4-hsl, respectively; furthermore, the lasr/lasi system can regulate the rhlr/rhli system at the transcriptional and post-translational levels  <cit> . it has been reported that the pvdq acylase degrades only ahls with long acyl-chains  and not those with short acyl-chains   <cit> . the co-existence of ahls with an ahl-degrading enzyme in p. aeruginosa pao <dig> has been suggested for fine-tuning the expression of virulent genes by manipulating the ratios of their two ahl signals  <cit> .

ralstonia solanacearum is an important soil-borne plant pathogen with an extensive host range. it generally causes severe bacterial wilt disease in many economic crops, including tomato, potato, tobacco, peanut, and banana  <cit> . r. solanacearum utilizes a complex hierarchical phca regulatory network to control its virulence factors  <cit> . the phca as the central transcriptional regulator in this global regulation network is modulated by 3-oh-palmitic acid methyl ester   <cit> . r. solanacearum also possesses a soli/solr quorum-sensing system that is a luxi/luxr homologue and is up-regulated by 3-oh-pame  <cit> . inactivation of solir eliminates the synthesis of c6- and c8- hsls, but does not affect disease or virulence factor production. at least one gene, aida with unknown function, is activated by solr  <cit> . the role of ahls in r. solanacearum gene regulation requires much further investigation. however, no report concerning any ahl-degrading enzyme from r. solanacearum has been published so far. in this study, an undemonstrated function of the aac sequence of r. solanacearumgmi <dig> homologous to the aiid acylase was cloned and characterised. the potential of ahl-degrading enzyme is also discussed here.

in vitro whole cell bioassay for ahl-degrading activity
the bioassay was modified from the method used for the isolation of ahl-degrading streptomyces strains  <cit> . for preparation of the well plate  <cit> ,  <dig> ml of lb agar containing  <dig> % agar was seeded with  <dig> ml of c. violaceum cv <dig> overnight culture, and then immediately poured over the surface of solidified lb agar. after the overlaid agar solidified, several wells were punched on the top of the lb agar to form the well plate. for preparation of the whole cell reaction mixture,  <dig> ml of e. coli clone overnight culture was centrifuged and suspended in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm tris buffer . then,  <dig> μl of the cell suspension  was mixed with an equal volume of  <dig> μm n--l-homoserine lactone  or c8-hsl  and incubated at 30°c, with gentle agitation, for  <dig> h. the whole cell reaction mixture was boiled  to stop the enzymatic reaction. one hundred microlitres of the reaction mixture was loaded into the well on the plate. the loaded bioassay plate was finally incubated in the upright position at 30°c for  <dig> h to observe whether adequate colour development was achieved. a violet pigmentation of the bacterial lawn distributed around the wells indicated an absence of ahl-degrading activity.

cloning and expression of aac gene
the plasmid dna pzc <dig>  carrying the aac gene, was prepared by using gene-spin miniprep purification kit  and used as a pcr template. the aac gene was amplified by pcr with primers, 5'-gaggtaccgaaggaggacaccgcatg-3'  and 5'-cgactagttcactgcgacagctttgtcacct-3' . template dna  was added to the pcr reactions at a final reaction volume of  <dig> μl , and  <dig>  u dynazyme™ ii dna polymerase . pcr was performed in a geneamp pcr system  <dig> . the pcr products were digested with kpni and spei and then purified by a pcr-m™ clean up system kit . eighty ng of the purified pcr product was added into  <dig> μl of the ligation mixture  and incubated at 16°c for  <dig> h. the resulting construct, ps3aac, was transformed into e. coli dh10b by the heat shock method  <cit>  and screened on lb agar containing tetracycline , isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside , and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside . then, the positive clones of e. coli dh10b  expressing ahl-degrading activity were identified through the in vitro whole cell bioassay. next, the cloned aac gene was sequenced by an abi prism 3730xl dna analyzer along with an abi prism bigdye terminator cycle sequencing ready reaction kit .

preparation of crude aac proteins
the aac gene was amplified by pcr with the primers 5'-cgcagaattcatgacgcacggattc-3'  and 5'-cggcaagcttctgcgacagctttg-3' , and then ligated to vector pet21a . the resultant pet21aac was transformed into the expression host e. coli bl <dig>  one ml of cultured e. coli bl <dig>   were induced by using  <dig>  mm iptg for  <dig> h at 20°c. the harvested cells were resuspended in  <dig>  ml of  <dig> mm sodium phosphate  and then broken by ultrasonification for  <dig> min  with a sonicator® . the total proteins were analysed by 6% sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis .

esi-ms analysis
to analyse the degradation products of c7-hsl that were digested by e. coli , electrospray ionization mass spectrometry  was performed on a q-tof ultima™ api equipped with a nano-spray z-spray source . one ml of e. coli  cells  was washed three times and suspended in  <dig> ml of  <dig> mm sodium phosphate buffer  containing either  <dig>  mm c7-hsl or  <dig> mm ammonia acetate buffer  containing  <dig>  mm c7-hsl, and then each sample was incubated at 30°c for  <dig> h. the reaction mixtures were centrifuged at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min and then the supernatants were collected as the analytic samples. the analytic sample with the sodium phosphate buffer was diluted 100-fold with  <dig> % triethylamine  containing 40% acetonitrile and 10% methanol and was then ionised by positive-ion electrospray  to detect hsl. the analytic sample with the ammonia acetate buffer was diluted 10-fold with 50% methanol and then ionised by negative-ion electrospray  to detect heptanoic acid. in order to analyse the degradation products of aculeacin a, i.e. palmatic acid,  <dig> μl of aac-digested mixture  was diluted with  <dig> μl of 50% acetonitrile containing  <dig> % formic acid and then detected by esi+-ms.

in this study, we used the following condition for esi-ms. approximately  <dig> nl/min analyte flow rate was used with the q-tof instrument. the cone and capillary voltage was set to  <dig> v and  <dig>  kv, respectively, and the source block and desolvation temperature was 80°c and 150°c, respectively. the range of m/z value was set to  <dig> ~ <dig> since this was sufficient for all of degraded products. data was analyzed by masslynx  <dig>  software .

hsl-opa assay for ahl-acylase activity
a modified homoserine lactone-o-phthaldialdehyde  assay was used to quantify the ahl-acylase activity  <cit> . seven ahls  were used as substrates of ahl-acylase. various ahl-degrading products were collected using the preparation method of the analytic sample in the sodium phosphate buffer, as described in esi-ms analysis. one hundred μl of each ahl-degrading product was immediately mixed with  <dig> μl of o-phthaldialdehyde reagent solution , and then the mixture was incubated for  <dig> min at 25°c to prepare the fluorescent derivative of the released hsl. the absorbance of opa-derivatives was measured at od <dig> using a u- <dig> spectrophotometer . a standard hsl with a range of  <dig>  ~ <dig> mm was used to calibrate the assay and render a linear correlation: od <dig> =  <dig>   . one unit of the ahl-acylase activity is defined as the released nmol amount of hsl after an ahl is digested by  <dig> ml of cell suspension  at 30°c for  <dig> min.

violacein quantitative assay
to observe the in vivo expression of the aac gene in c. violaceum, the ps3aac was transformed to c. violaceum cv <dig> by the heat shock method  <cit>  and a violacein quantitative assay  <cit>  was performed. one ml of cultured c. violaceum cv <dig>   was added into  <dig> ml of fresh lb broth containing tetracycline and  <dig>  mm c7-hsl, and then incubated at 30°c at  <dig> rpm for  <dig> h. at intervals of  <dig> h, the violacein from  <dig>  ml of various interval cells was extracted with  <dig> ml of 95% ethanol for  <dig> min. the supernatant containing the violacein was collected by centrifuging at  <dig>  rpm for  <dig> min. the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at a wavelength of  <dig> nm  using a u- <dig> spectrophotometer .

chitinase activity assay
the chitinolytic activity assay was modified from the method for detecting chitinolytic activity on agar plates  <cit> . cells were seeded on lb agar containing tetracycline ,  <dig>  mm c7-hsl, and  <dig> %  chitin from crab shells . the plate was incubated at 30°c for  <dig> ~ <dig> d to observe whether a clear zone formed around the colonies. the formation of a clear zone indicated a positive reaction.

minimal inhibitory concentration  of aculeacin a
the assay for the determination of mic values of aculeacin a was modified from the dilution susceptibility test  <cit> . a series of samples of  <dig> ml lb broth containing either aculeacin a or aac-treated aculeacin a with concentrations in the range of 0– <dig> μg·ml- <dig> was prepared and inoculated with  <dig> μl of  <dig> h pre-cultured candida tropicalis f- <dig> and incubated at 37°c for  <dig> h. the growth of the cells was measured at od <dig>  serial dilutions of aculeacin a were incubated with  <dig> μg of purified aac in  <dig> μlof sodium phosphate  at 30°c for  <dig>  h; subsequently, the dilution susceptibility test was performed.

bioinformatics
the first cloned ahl-lactonase gene aiia  <cit>  and the ahl-acylase gene aiid  <cit>  were utilised as the target genes in the blastn and blastp programs  <cit>  at ncbi. several public r. solanacearumgmi <dig> genomic clones containing the aac gene were searched by the gmi <dig> clone finder. http://bioinfo.genopole-toulouse.prd.fr/annotation/iant/bacteria/ralsto/index.html.

RESULTS
identification of candidate ahl-degrading enzymes encoded by r. solanacearumgmi1000
blastn and blastp searches of the annotated r. solanacearumgmi <dig> genome sequence  and megaplasmid pgmi1000mp   <cit>  identified a single  <dig> -bp aac gene  with an 83% identity match when interrogated with the ahl-acylase aiid sequence  <cit> . no significant hits were obtained with the ahl lactonase aiia sequence  <cit> . however, the aac gene encodes a putative protein that was defined as a probable aculeacin a acylase transmembrane protein . among the function-demonstrating proteins, aac shared 83%, 39%, 24%, and 24% identities at the peptide level with the ahl-acylase from ralstonia sp. xj12b  <cit> , aculeacin a acylase from actinoplanes utahensis  <cit> , cephalosporin acylase from brevundimonas diminuta  <cit> , and penicillin g acylase from providencia rettgeri  <cit> , respectively.

cloning and expression of the aac gene of r. solanacearumgmi1000
the aac gene was pcr amplified  and the  <dig>  bp product was cloned in pbbr1mcs- <dig> to yield plasmid ps3aac. to analyse the ability of aac to degrade ahls ps3aac was used to transform e. coli dh10b. the cloned aac sequence was confirmed to have no mutations. for examining the degrading activity of the clone e. coli dh10b , c6-, c7-, and c8- hsls were used as autoinducers in performing a whole cell bioassay described in the materials and methods. the results of the whole cell bioassay revealed that e. coli dh10b  cells were inactive against c6-hsl while active against c7- and c8-hsls . since the vector pbbr1mcs- <dig> does not contain laci, we considered that e. coli dh10b  cells exhibit c7- and c8-hsls degrading activities inrespective of the presence or absence of iptg induction . because c7-hsl was a more sensitive ahl than c8-hsl , we chose c7-hsl for inducing c. violaceum cv <dig> to produce violacein in whole cell bioassay . the cells of e. coli dh10b  exhibited c7-hsl degrading activity , while no activity was observed in the cell-free culture supernatant of e. coli dh10b  . this data indicated that the protein encoded by the aac gene is a cell associated ahl-degrading enzyme. the aac gene was fused into pet21a to yield plasmid pet21aac, and then over expressed in e.coli bl <dig> from an inducible promoter. the sds-page analysis demonstrated that the iptg-induced total proteins contained a polypeptide with a molecular mass of  <dig> kda that was consistent with the  <dig> residues aac-fused protein that had a predicted molecular mass of  <dig>  da .

a the whole cells  and cell-free supernatants  of test strains, were prepared from the  <dig>  mm iptg induced and uninduced cultures, and then reacted with various ahls to perform whole cell bioassays. identical to the result in fig.  <dig>  the absence of a violet lawn indicates a positive ahl-degrading ability and is defined as'+'; a violet lawn indicates no ahl-degrading ability and is defined as'-'

aac is an ahl-acylase and not an aculeacin a acylase
to demonstrate whether the aac protein is an ahl-acylase, we performed the esi-ms analysis. e. coli dh10b  cells were first reacted with c7-hsl at 30°c for  <dig> min. if the enzyme encoded by the aac gene is an ahl-acylase, we predicted that two free digested products, hsl and heptanoic acid, would be detected. since esi+-ms could not detect the carboxylic group , only hsl was detectable. the fatty acids containing the carboxylic group would have to be detected by esi--ms. the analytic results showed that c7-hsl  could be digested into hsl  and heptanoic acid  . we also observed that the amount of the heptanoic acid gradually increased, starting from the 15th min until the 60th min of reaction times . thus, our results indicate that the aac gene encodes an ahl-acylase.

since aac was predicted as a probable aculeacin a acylase transmembrane protein, we compared the mics of aculeacin a and aac-treated aculeacin a in order to determine whether the aac protein functioned similar to aculeacin a acylase. as shown in table  <dig>  the mics of both aculeacin a and aac-treated aculeacin a for candida tropicalis f- <dig> were  <dig>  μg·ml- <dig>  in addition, the predicted aac-digested products of aculeacin a, i.e. palmatic acid , were not found in the esi-ms analysis . these results revealed that aac is not an aculeacin a acylase.

a values represent the averages ± standard errors from triplicate independent assays. by one-tailed student's t-test , the value with an asterisk  designates a significant difference from the  <dig> μg·ml- <dig> of aculeacin a test shown in the same row. there is no significant difference between aac-untreated aculeacin a and aac-treated aculeacin a in the same column

aac is active against ahls with acyl side chains greater than  <dig> carbons
to determine the substrate specificity and enzymatic activity of the ahl-acylase aac in e. coli dh10b , a range of ahls were mixed with cells of e. coli dh10b  to perform the hsl-opa assay. as shown in table  <dig>  e. coli dh10b  could not degrade the short-chain ahls, c4-, c6-, or 3oc6-hsls; however, e. coli dh10b  exhibited activities against long-chain ahls, c7-, c8-, 3oc8-, c10-hsls. the ahls of more than ten carbon-acyl chains, i.e. c12-hsl and c14-hsl, could not be determined due to the poor solubility of their substrate. these results indicate that the substrate specificity of the ahl-acylase aac is within the limit of more than six carbon-acyl chain ahls.

a values represent the averages ± standard errors from triplicate independent hsl-opa assays. the relative activity in parentheses is based on defining c7-hsl-degrading activity exhibited by e. coli dh10b  as 100%. the value with an asterisk  is the significant difference from the e. coli dh10b  shown in the same row by one-tailed student's t-test 

expression of the aac gene in c. violaceum cv <dig> inhibited the production of violacein and chitinase activity that were observed in the ahl-mediated phenotype
to examine whether the aac gene has the potential of being a quorum-quenching agent, an ahl regulated strain, c. violaceum cv <dig>  was used as a target microorganism. the mutant c. violaceum cv <dig> cannot produce violacein unless provided with exogenous ahl  <cit> . therefore the ps3aac was transformed into c. violaceum cv <dig> to observe whether violacein production was reduced during culture with exogenous ahl. as shown in fig. 4a, the result indicates that the expression of the aac gene did not influence the growth of c. violaceum cv <dig> during the late exponential phase but slightly influenced its growth during the stationary phase. interestingly, c. violaceum cv <dig>  produced violacein after the late exponential phase, while c. violaceum cv <dig>  completely failed in producing violacein . since it was reported that chitinases could be regulated by endogenous c6-hsl in c. violaceum atcc  <dig>  <cit> , we decided to evaluate the chitinolytic activity of c. violaceum cv <dig> . c. violaceum cv <dig>  was able to form clear zones on lb agar containing tetracycline, chitin, and c7-hsl. however, no clear zone were observed around the c. violaceum cv <dig>  colonies . these results indicated that transferring the aac gene into c. violaceum cv <dig> significantly inhibited violacein production and chitinase activity.

discussion
we successfully subcloned and identified an aac gene  from r. solanacearumgmi <dig> as an ahl-acylase that did not degrade aculeacin a, ampicillin, and ceftazidime . the amino acid sequence of aac is similar to that of ahl-acylase from ralstonia sp. xj12b  with 83% identity. however, this is the first study to report the presence of an ahl-acylase in a phytopathogen.

to verify the existence of an ahl-acylase, both gas chromatography assays  <cit>  and hplc-esi-ms analyses  <cit>  are generally used to analyse the digested ahl products. our report provides a simple and rapid esi-ms analysis to verify ahl-acylase. to identify an ahl-acylase, two target products, the released hsl and the corresponding fatty acid, were detected when the ahl was digested by the ahl-degrading clone. since the released fatty acids would be further metabolized by β-oxidation during cultivation  <cit> , excessively long digestion times should be avoided. the digestion mixture was directly used as a sample to perform esi-ms analysis. the reaction buffers were observed to have a decisive effect on esi-ms analysis. when  <dig> mm sodium phosphate  was used as a reaction buffer, only the phosphate  was found in the esi--ms pattern, wherein the fatty acid was still not detectable . in contrast, when  <dig> mm ammonia acetate was used as a reaction buffer to avoid the phosphate effect, the fatty acid was detected by esi--ms .

among the reported ahl-acylases, only aiic can deacylate the short chain c6-hsl  <cit> . in addition, pvdqand quip were verified to express c7-hsl-degrading activity. however, the substrate specificity of the aac for ahls is within the limits of more than six carbon-acyl chain . moreover, transferring the aac gene into c. violaceum cv <dig> significantly influenced violacein production and chitinase activity . these results indicated that aac has the potential to be a quorum- quenching agent.

although the quorum-sensing signal for controlling the virulence factors of r. solanacearum is 3-oh-pame, soli and solr are members of the 3-oh-pame communication system regulon  <cit> . in our study, no 3-oh-pame-degrading enzyme has been found using the blastp search when interrogated with the beta-hydroxypalmitate methyl ester hydrolase   <cit> . there are soli  and solr  proteins of r. solanacearumgmi <dig> sharing 86% and 87% identity, respectively, with that of soli  and solr  from r. solanacearumaw <dig>  because the soli  synthesizes c6- and c8-hsls, the gmi <dig> strain might be expected to produce both of them. although the physiological role of ahl-acylase in r. solanacearum is unclear yet, we consider that r. solanacearum might adopt a unique signal turnover system to control existing signals from a quorum-sensing mode  <cit> . the ahl-acylase would be a mechanism of interference to degrade exogenous signals produced by competitors. it may also be possible that these acylase prevent the accumulation of self generated signals, allowing the quorum response to switch off as is seen in agrobacterium tumefaciens  <cit> .

recently, several reports indicated that quorum-quenching enzymes, such as lactonase, ahl-acylase, and oxidoreductase, have potential to be used as peptide drugs. among them, ahl-lactonase has been applied in genetically engineered procedures to control plant diseases  <cit> . eventually such enzymes would lead to the attenuation of the expression of quorum-sensing regulated functions in microorganisms. ahl-lactonases will alter the ahls structure, thus mediating ph-dependent lactonolysis; however, lactonases-inactivated ahls could be readily reverted to the active forms with lactone-ring closure  <cit> . this drawback would interfere with the development of ahl-lactonase as peptide drugs. since ahl-acylases have none of the drawbacks described above, aac could become a potential quorum-quenching agent in the near feature.

CONCLUSIONS
this paper describes the identification of ahl-acylase, aac, from r. solanacearumgmi <dig> with esi-ms mass spectrometry analysis and whole cell bioassay, together with the analysis of mic test of aculeacin a. the results showed strong evidence that the aac in r. solanacearumgmi <dig> functions as an ahl-acylase and not an aculeacin a acylase. thus, we consider that renaming the aac gene of r. solanacearumgmi <dig> as "the alas gene" is necessary in further studies for the purpose of clarity. moreover, this is the first report to find an ahl-acylase in a phytopathogen.
