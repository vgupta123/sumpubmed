BACKGROUND
ciliates form an extremely diverse taxonomic group of protozoa. they are the most complex single-celled eukaryotes, with some genomes containing more than  <dig>  genes  <cit> , examples are the two completely sequenced ciliates paramecium   <cit>  and tetrahymena   <cit> . they are abundant in almost every aqueous environment, from ocean waters to small ponds and even pockets of soil water; and they can grow as symbionts, commensals and parasites in pelagic, benthic, sapropelic or intestinal ecosystems. however, despite this diversity, ciliates have one common and unique feature: they possess two types of nuclei, each with its own specific function.

the micronucleus of ciliates represents the germ-line and contains high molecular weight dna in the form of large chromosomes, while the macronucleus encodes proteins and rnas required for somatic functions  <cit> . the macronucleus contains dna on sub-chromosomal fragments, which in paramecium and tetrahymena range from  <dig> kb to more than  <dig>  kb  <cit> . macronuclei are generated from the post conjugation micronuclei in a complex process that involves dna elimination and large-scale genomic rearrangements  <cit> . this process and the genetic organization of the macronucleus have been intensively studied in both peritrichous and spirotrichous  ciliates  <cit> . in peritrichous ciliates, such as paramecium and tetrahymena, about 20% of the micronuclear dna is deleted during macronucleus formation, the chromosomes become fragmented and reorganized in sub-chromosomal molecules. in spirotrichous ciliates such as stylonychia or sterkiella , the formation of macronuclei is especially complex since it can involve the loss of more than 95% of the complexity of the dna and large-scale reordering of the protein-encoding dna segments. protein-encoding sequences are joined and assembled into the proper open reading frame, a process that depends on maternal guide rnas  <cit> . lastly, the open reading frames , together with non-coding 5' – leader and 3' – trailer sequences, are released as individual, short dna molecules. these molecules are capped with telomeres, and selectively amplified as individual "mini-chromosomes"  <cit> .

in certain spirotrichous ciliates, the development of the new macronucleus involves transient formation of polytene chromosomes  <cit> . these giant chromosomes resemble the polytene chromosomes of dipteran larvae but are transcriptionally inactive and disintegrate shortly after reaching their highest degree of polyteny  <cit> . genome rearrangements, dna elimination and, lastly, reorganization of the residual dna into "gene-sized pieces" occur during the breakdown of polytene chromosomes.

here we examine the structure of the macronuclear dna of nyctotherus ovalis, a member of a third group of ciliates known as the heterotrichous ciliates. n. ovalis lives in an anaerobic intestinal environment. it is of particular interest because it possesses hydrogenosomes that contain a genome  <cit>  and that therewith have provided evidence that these organelles evolved from a mitochondrial ancestor  <cit> . there are some reports  <cit>  that the heterotrichous ciliates nyctotherus cordiformis and n. ovalis, which live in the intestinal tracts of frogs and cockroaches, respectively, form polytene chromosomes after conjugation, similar to stylonychia  <cit> . with respect to the structure of the n. ovalis macronuclear chromosomes there is evidence from studies on individual genes, such as those for hydrogenase  <cit>  and alpha tubulin  <cit>  from telomere-capped sequences  <cit> , as well as from a set of  <dig> complete macronuclear chromosomes  <cit> , that n. ovalis, like stylonychia, has gene-sized chromosomes. alignment of the macronuclear chromosomes with known proteins furthermore has indicated the presence of short  introns  <cit> . we examined the structure of n. ovalis gene-sized chromosomes and the regulation of their transcription by combining information from large-scale cdna  and cdna libraries . n. ovalis possesses very minimal macronuclear chromosomes, with short leaders, tiny introns and single genes. the introns tend either to contain in-frame stop codons, or their length is not dividable by three. n. ovalis thus prevents translation of unspliced mrnas, as has been described for p. tetraurelia  <cit> .

RESULTS
 <dig>  chromosome structure
 <dig> . <dig> gene-sized chromosomes
we surveyed the genomic organization of the macronucleus of n. ovalis. agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that the majority of the undigested dna isolated from intact n. ovalis was present in the form of low molecular weight dna . southern blotting revealed that genes were present as gene-sized dna fragments . to survey the genome organization of n. ovalis at the sequence level, we generated a macronuclear gdna library and sequenced  <dig>  representative clones, as well as  <dig>  cdnas from a polya-plus cdna library. it should thereby be noted that n. ovalis cannot be cultured yet. cells have to be isolated by hand from dissected hindguts of cockroaches. only a small number of cockroaches contain n. ovalis cells at a density of several hundred cells per hindgut, making it very difficult to obtain sufficient material for dna/rna isolation. therefore, performing a total sequencing of the genome and the corresponding cdnas will therefore be extremely difficult if not impossible. in the current study we obtained  <dig>  non-redundant gdnas and cdnas with a limited overlap between them. assuming a genome size similar to the published ciliate genomes  this corresponds to ~15% of the total genome. randomly selected clones were sequenced in a single reaction. after filtering vector sequences and poorly-resolved terminal regions , we clustered the remaining sequences to remove redundancy. grouping sequences with ≥ 97% identity over a stretch of at least  <dig> nucleotides resulted in our identifying  <dig>  gdna clusters  and  <dig>  cdna clusters . these will be referred to as the nr-set . sequences with non-determined nucleotides  were excluded from analyses that required correct nucleotides at all positions, like genetic code analysis .

in the  <dig>  gdna nr-set we identified  <dig> sequences that were capped by telomeres at both ends, representing complete macronuclear chromosomes. in none of these could we find evidence for the presence of more than a single gene . moreover, we examined carefully all the incomplete gdna sequences for multiple genes containing macronuclear chromosomes. here too we only observed a single gene per chromosome. the vast majority of the macronuclear chromosomes were smaller than  <dig> kb, and the sequencing of clones with inserts less than 6– <dig> kb did not provide any evidence for the presence of more than one gene per chromosome. however, there were dna bands  larger than  <dig> kb that were neither cloned nor sequenced. therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that a few chromosomes with several genes were present. similarly to the protein-coding chromosomes, the nr-set was found to contain  <dig> separate chromosomes coding for single trna molecules. we will refer to this pattern as a "one macronuclear chromosome one-transcript rule" rather than a "one-macronuclear chromosome one-gene rule", because the complete ribosomal array  is located on a single macronuclear chromosome and the complete ribosomal rna tends to be encoded on a single transcript in ciliates  <cit> .

we examined the macronuclear chromosome length distribution for all  <dig> fully-sequenced chromosomes . the smallest two-telomere-capped sequence we found that encodes a known gene was a serine trna , with  <dig> nucleotides between the two telomeres. the smallest two-telomere-containing sequence we found for which no homologs could be identified was  <dig> nt . this sequence is the smallest putative macronuclear chromosome ever identified . the presence of this  <dig> nt macronuclear chromosome was confirmed by nested pcr with specific primers. it does not contain a substantial open reading frame and might therefore code for a structural rna. however, analysis of its rna secondary structure did not indicate a significantly lower free energy than for random sequences with the same base composition, nor did analysis with mirna prediction programs indicate a mirna like structure .

 <dig> . <dig> telomere sequences
we sequenced  <dig> full length macronuclear chromosomes using the same approach applied to other species  <cit> . telomeres were observed with the sequence cccn at the 5' end, and the sequence mggg mggggttt) at the 3' end, with n and m ranging from  <dig> to  <dig>  there appeared to be a trend of one long and one short telomere, giving rise to a negative pearson product-moment correlation coefficient between the number of repeats in 5' and 3' telomeres . this contrasts with the report of cavalcanti et al.  <cit> , who observed no clear trend in the lengths of telomeres in sterkiella histriomuscorum . however, the libraries were generated differently and our initial data set of  <dig> sequences was small compared to the  <dig>  clones in ref  <cit> .

using the motifs determined above, we identified telomeres on  <dig>  of the  <dig>  gdna sequences. of these sequences,  <dig> contained telomeres on both sides, suggesting that they represented complete macronuclear chromosomes. several  chromosomes carrying a single gene have been sequenced manually using suppression pcr as in  <cit> . because we used telomere primers for amplification of the total gdna for the generation of the gdna library, we could not determine the length of the telomeres in the set of  <dig> exactly, as primer-shifting occurs during the pcr.

 <dig> . <dig> subtelomeric regions
we define the chromosomal leader as the subtelomeric region that runs from the 5' telomere to the beginning of the orf and the chromosomal trailer as the subtelomeric region that runs from the stop codon to the 3' telomere. in order to identify these regions, we first oriented  <dig>  gdnas by predicted homology to a known protein in uniprot . subsequently we compared these gdnas with the  <dig>  nr-cdnas using genedetective  followed by manual checking of all cdna/gdna pairs. combining these data with the putatively homologous proteins from uniprot, we could infer the position of  <dig> atg start codons precisely. the size of the leaders in these  <dig> chromosomes ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides, with an average of  <dig>  while the length of the 5'utrs ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides. we followed the same procedure to identify the trailers and 3' utrs: using the cdnas with a match against the gdnas and against a known protein we could accurately identify eight regions running from the stop codon until the polya addition site. the 3' utr length ranges from  <dig> to  <dig> with an average of  <dig> nucleotides. taa was generally used as stop codon. the size of the chromosomal trailers ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides.

to examine whether there were any biases in the nucleotide composition of the subtelomeric regions, we calculated the shannon entropy, the purine skew, and gc skew for the  <dig> first nucleotides after the 5' telomeres and for the last  <dig> nucleotides before the 3' telomeres.

 <dig> sequences were found to contain at least  <dig> nucleotides after the 5' telomere and to have a blastx hit in uniprot that allowed determination of the coding strand. the shannon entropy and the frequency of each base are plotted in figure  <dig>  for four different states , the maximum entropy is two, corresponding to equal nucleotide frequencies. lower entropies indicate a bias in the composition.

the results indicated a bias in the nucleotide frequencies in the first  <dig> bases that was found to disappear at about  <dig> nucleotides. the region of the bias coincided with the length of the 5' leaders . to explain the low entropy, we examined different types of biases in the nucleotide composition. we observed the strongest bias in the purine/pyrimidine ratio, expressed in the so-called purine skew -)/+). this index varied from - <dig>  to  <dig> , with a value of  <dig> corresponding to no skew. more purines than pyrimidines were found in the 5' region of the coding strand , especially in the first ~ <dig> nt.

there were  <dig> sequences containing at least  <dig> nucleotides before the 3' telomere, having a blastx hit in uniprot that allowed determination of the coding strand. as with the 5' ends of the chromosomes, the shannon entropy indicated a bias in the last ~ <dig> nucleotides, but in contrast to the 5' leader, a low percentage of g and a general pyrimidine skew. in other words, symmetry was found in the purine skew. whether one starts from the 5' end of the coding strand, or from the 5' end of the non-coding strand, there is a strong purine skew near the telomere. the pyrimidine skew at the 3' end of the chromosomes did not, however, extend into the coding region, which showed a general purine skew . this allowed us to predict which strand was coding in chromosomes without detectable homology to a known protein . the purine skew in the subtelomeric regions has also been described for the ciliate sterkiella  <cit> . the skew represents a violation of parity rule two, which states that complementary dna strands tend to have the same purine/pyrimidine composition  <cit> .

 <dig> . <dig> intron structure
to detect introns, we first performed a comparison between the cdna and gdna clustered sets using genedetective . after removing paralogs and refining the intron boundaries by hand, we identified a total of  <dig> introns in  <dig> gdnas. this intron set will be referred to as the experimentally-derived introns. all introns were very short, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nucleotides with an average of  <dig> nt and a median of  <dig> nt . intron prediction based on the comparison with p. tetraurelia proteins  gave an identical median of  <dig> nt but a larger average of  <dig> nt, due to a tail of a few relatively long introns . this is similar to the average intron length of  <dig> nt  reported by mcgrath et al. <cit> , which was based on comparison of gdnas with known proteins. comparison of the average intron length  with the intron length range  in the analysis of mcgrath et al., indicates their intron length distribution also has a long tail. the existence of these "long" introns  is weakly supported, as we do not observe them in our more direct gdna/cdna based comparisons. furthermore, by doing blastx comparisons with a larger database  we could correct  <dig> of the  <dig> long  and very short introns  that were predicted by the comparison with p. tetraurelia to fall within the boundaries that were identified for the experimental introns . this underscores that intron prediction by comparison against a protein database depends critically on the proteins in that database.

the boundaries of the experimentally derived introns are very similar to each other: exon|gta......tag|exon; where "|" is the border between exon and intron , with only two exceptions for which the last three intron nucleotides are cag and tgg. examination of the introns with alignace  <cit> , a program that finds conserved motifs, did not identify a branch point or any other overrepresented motifs other than the intron boundaries. the introns contain a high percentage of thymidine  in the introns versus 23% in the coding sequence. guanine  and cytidine  are low, while adenine  is more or less the same in the coding regions and the introns. this is different from what we observe for other non-coding sequences such as the leaders, where the thymidine content was lower than in the coding sequence. the introns in protein-coding sequences appear to be of the type that is excised by the spliceosome. supporting the presence of a standard mrna splicing machinery, we identified seven homologs of members of the spliceosome complex: splicing factor 3b subunit  <dig>  splicing factor 3a subunit  <dig>  splicing factor yt <dig>  splicing factor  <dig>  splicing factor slu <dig>  spliceosomal u <dig> snrnp-specific  <dig> kda protein and splicing factor u2af  <dig> kda subunit.

 <dig> . <dig> intron conservation
to examine the evolutionary conservation of the intron positions, we compared the  <dig> introns of the  <dig> n. ovalis gdna sequences  with those of their closest homologs in the ciliate paramecium tetraurelia. the latter also has tiny introns  for which a large number have been experimentally determined . of the ten introns in n. ovalis sequences with significant best hits in p. tetraurelia, in which the aligned regions "covered" the n. ovalis introns, four occur at the same position in p. tetraurelia. a typical example is the succinyl coa ligase gene that contains two introns in n. ovalis. one of these is conserved in p. tetraurelia, which itself has two introns in the region that can be confidently aligned between the two species . to our knowledge this is the first observation of the conservation of these tiny introns. in order to quantify the level of intron conservation, we performed a second analysis in which we compared the n. ovalis gdnas in which intron locations were predicted using genewise  <cit>   with proteins with experimentally determined  intron locations in paramecium tetraurelia . here we observed conservation of the intron position for  <dig> introns between p. tetraurelia and n. ovalis, out of  <dig> introns that genewise predicted in n. ovalis based on comparisons of the n. ovalis gdnas with the p. tetraurelia proteins. the fraction of conservation of tiny introns between these ciliates therefore appears to be about 1/ <dig> 

jaillon et al.  <cit>  have reported that introns which lack in-frame stop codons tend not to occur in lengths dividable by three. this guarantees that unspliced mrnas will be recognized by the nmd by having premature stop codons, either in the intron itself or caused by the frame shift resulting from the retained intron. such a trend is also visible in the n. ovalis predicted introns. out of the  <dig> introns,  <dig> do not have an in-frame stop codon . out of these  <dig> only  <dig> have a length that is dividable by three. in contrast, of the  <dig> introns that do have an in-frame stop codon,  <dig> have a length dividable by three. there is thus, among the introns without in-frame stop codons, a significant under-representation of introns dividable by three compared to introns that do contain stop codons .

the conservation of tiny introns between the very distantly-related p. tetraurelia and n. ovalis indicates that some introns can be traced back to early ciliate evolution. we also examined conservation of intron positions with tetrahymena thermophila, which does not contain tiny introns . in the sequence alignments, the positions of three t. thermophila introns lay within  <dig> amino acids of introns in n. ovalis . this would argue for independent evolution of intron position and intron length. alternatively, in ciliates with tiny introns it is possible that intron length is strongly reduced during the development of the macronucleus. in any case, the total number of conserved introns for which there is experimental evidence in at least one species is small, and precludes definitive statements regarding their independent evolution from genome structure. we could not detect any conservation of intron positions in the more distantly-related alveolate plasmodium falciparum. we searched for gdnas resulting from bacterial to ciliate or archaeal to ciliate horizontal gene transfer events using a similar method as we used for rumen ciliates  <cit> . in this set we found no evidence of introns.

with a length between  <dig> and  <dig> nucleotides and an average of ~ <dig> nucleotides, the introns in the n. ovalis set described in this report are among the smallest spliceosomal introns known. the shortest spliceosomal introns,  <dig> nucleotides, have been described in the nucleomorph of a chlorarachniophyte algae  <cit> . several short introns have been described in ciliates in the literature. for example, the introns in p. tetraurelia are between  <dig> and  <dig> nt  <cit> , and the introns in sterkiella histriomuscorum are between  <dig> and  <dig> nt in length  <cit> . in euplotes octocarinatus, introns were detected in a range of  <dig> to  <dig> nt  <cit> . four short introns, ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> nt, were also described in gamma tubulin encoding genes of euplotes crassus  <cit> .

 <dig>  transcriptional properties
 <dig> . <dig> orientation of the sequences
the macronuclear chromosomes we sequenced contain just one gene. being able to determine the coding strand of these sequences would be a first step in annotating those sequences without hits against known proteins. we used the observation that the coding strand has a positive purine/pyrimidine ratio  to orient the sequences that lack hits to known proteins. two other methods that we applied were: 1) finding the best orf using getorf from emboss and 2) calculating the gc gradient  <cit>  on the set of  <dig>  sequences having a match against a known protein from uniprot , as a benchmark. the purine/pyrimidine ratio was the best indicator of the coding strand with a good prediction in 97% of the cases, compared to 80% for the orf prediction and ~50% for the gc gradient. using the purine/pyrimidine ratio allowed us to orient all  <dig>  sequences that did not belong to the uniprot-set with 97% confidence.

 <dig> . <dig> motif discovery
in all ciliate species with gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes which have been studied, approximately 95% of germ-line dna is eliminated during the development of the macronucleus  <cit> . the incredibly short leader and trailer that remain must therefore contain a high density of signals for processes like telomere addition, replication, copy regulation and transcription. thus, ciliates provide a uniquely compact model to study these basic eukaryotic regulatory systems. because we identified homologs of a number of transcription factors ) in our data set, we can also expect their regulatory elements to be present in the n. ovalis macronuclear genome. we searched our nr-set of n. ovalis sequences for novel motifs and known transcription factor binding sites .

as genes with related functions are often co-regulated, they may be expected to contain comparable signals in their non-coding dna  <cit> . therefore, to search for meaningful motifs, we first composed groups of related genes based on a number of different criteria. genes were clustered based on membership of an orthologous group  to detect signals shared by paralogous genes, or on the membership of a common pathway. for the latter we used both the kegg pathways and ecocyc pathways. in addition we composed a set of  <dig> non-redundant trnas identified with trnascan-se  <cit> . for each group of sequences , we searched the first  <dig> nucleotides after the 5'-telomere using alignace  <cit>  and meme  <cit> . note that  <dig> nt should be enough to cover the complete upstream non-coding dna, even in the sequences where no translation start site could be identified .

using this approach, we could identify several potential regulatory motifs. first, meme identified a motif with the consensus sequence aattaacatgagtc in the upstream regions of  <dig> chaperonin groel genes of the hsp <dig> family . searching this motif with mast, we found that it also occurs upstream of a protein from the superfamily dna and rna helicase, with the motif profile fitting the helicase sequence with an e-value of  <dig> e- <dig>  hsp <dig> and helicase could be regulated concomitantly as they can both be regulated by dna-dependent protein kinase  <cit> . another study also reported that dysregulated expression of an rna helicase leads to an altered distribution of hsp <dig>  <cit> .

second, we identified conserved motifs in the trna chromosomes, by searching the entire set of gene-sized trna chromosomes . two of the motifs we identified have very well-conserved positions: a likely tata box , and a motif with consensus gcaatttttattcc . this last motif corresponds to the termination signal of rna polymerase iii transcription  <cit> . searching for these motifs in the whole nr-set using mast  <cit>  identified no other sequences that contained these motifs, which is not surprising, as the protein coding genes are transcribed by rna polymerase ii. the tata box could be identified in some sequences that we checked manually.

in an additional search for known tfbs, we used mast  <cit>  to search for the  <dig> transfac matrix  <dig>  motifs  <cit> . these results did not link sets of functionally related sequences .

considering the few motifs identified in these analyses, it should also be noted that the transfac profiles we searched for are specific for several eukaryotic species but not for ciliates. furthermore, previous studies of spirotrichous ciliates have identified few conserved motifs, leading to the suggestion that telomeres may also play a role in regulating gene expression/dna replication  <cit> .

in the trailer region we searched for the consensus eukaryotic polyadenylation signal aataaa  <cit> . this motif was not found in our sequences, confirming a previous study on a smaller dataset  <cit> . examining by hand the eight pieces of trailer sequences identified with the help of cdnas and known homologs  revealed no degenerate motif either. mcgrath and co-workers  <cit>  have reported an over-represented long motif in the 5' and 3' ends in their set of  <dig> complete chromosomes, and a shorter subsequence of that motif in the 5' and 3' ends of all the chromosomes. neither the consensus sequence of the long motif, nor its shorter subsequence was present in our dataset, nor could we detect significant similarity to the consensus sequences in our gdnas.

 <dig> . <dig> genetic code
in a set of  <dig> cdnas that could confidently be aligned with the c-terminus of known proteins, taa was most often the first codon after the c-terminus of the protein alignment , and therewith obviously the stop codon. consistent with earlier findings that were based on smaller sets of sequences  <cit>  we conclude that n. ovalis preferentially uses uaa as a stop codon. uag was rarely observed in the stop codon position  and uga was never observed in the stop codon position. when reexamining the published sequences from mcgrath et al. <cit>  and destables et al. <cit>  we noticed that when using this strict criterion of requiring an alignment until the end of the c-terminus of a known protein and only considering as potential stop codon the first codon 3' of the protein alignment, also in these sets taa was the only stop codon that could confidently be assigned. nevertheless, uga and uag are, like uaa, avoided in cdnas that could be aligned with known proteins or protein domains. ciliates have a wide variety of genetic codes  <cit> . for example, several deeply-diverging lineages, including the genera tetrahymena and paramecium, stylonychia and sterkiella, and diophrys  <cit>  may have independently reassigned uaa and uag to glutamine, using uga as their only stop codon  <cit> . on the other hand, euplotes translates uga into cysteine and uses uaa and uag as stop codons <cit> , while uga encodes tryptophan in the independent lineages including blepharisma and colpoda  <cit> . nyctotherus thus seems most similar to euplotes, using predominantly uaa, and sometimes uag as a stop codon. the absence of strong positive evidence for the usage of uag and uga is consistent with a previous claim  <cit>  that nyctotherus might represent an evolutionary intermediate between the full standard genetic code and a variant code. we could, however, find no evidence for the usage of uga or uag as a sense codon, and combined with earlier findings of the usage of uaa and uga as stop codon  <cit>  this argues for a standard genetic code in n. ovalis.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
evolution of macronuclear gene structure
to analyze the evolution of ciliate macronuclear genome structure we performed a phylogenetic analysis of the 18s rna from the small ribosomal subunit from various ciliates . the clevelandelids  form a monophyletic group with the armophorea  and are a sister group of the spirotrichea that contains sterkiella , stylonychia and euplotes. despite their differences in ecology , these two sister groups share many features, as already mentioned  <cit> . another class of ciliates, namely the phyllopharyngea, also possess gene-sized macronuclear chromosomes, but they are not monophyletic with the spirotrich/clevelandelids/armophorids  <cit> . 'invention' of gene-sized-macronuclear chromosomes has therefore either preceded their taxonomic separation or more likely arisen several times in evolution. rumen ciliates that are included in the cluster of 'fragmented' macronuclear chromosomes have much larger  macronuclear chromosomes with many genes per chromosome . they may represent an intermediate between the 'tetrahymena/paramecium" type of long macronuclear chromosomes and gene-sized-chromosomes. the presence of tiny introns does not correlate with the presence of mini-chromosomes. rather, the exact conservation of the location of a substantial number of the tiny introns between n. ovalis and p. tetraurelia argues for independent evolution of the length of macronuclear chromosomes and intron size. we currently have scarce information about the germ-line micronuclear genome of n. ovalis. however, all the items discussed above reveal a striking similarity with the macronuclear genome organization of the spirotrichous ciliates  <cit> . codon usage suggests that nyctotherus may be more closely related to euplotes than to the oxytrichids; however there is no evidence that it has a non-standard genetic code.
