BACKGROUND
the balance between endothelial cell  survival and apoptosis is an important cellular process involved in preserving blood vessel integrity and vascular homeostasis  <cit> . lining the surface of vascular structures, ecs should endure a variety of normal or abnormal stresses that are both chemical and physical in nature. aberrant stresses may break the dynamic balance and contribute to irreversible endothelial dysfunctions due to ec apoptosis and vessel integrity defects  <cit> . studies have demonstrated that modulating this balance is important in the initiation and development of many vascular diseases, e.g. stroke, diabetic retinopathies, thrombosis, and atherosclerosis  <cit> . therefore, identifying the regulatory mechanisms of the survival and apoptosis of ecs may provide opportunities to improve clinical therapies for the treatment of these vascular diseases.

transcription has been well studied and has been shown to be of considerable importance in modulating ec apoptosis  <cit> . alternative splicing , an important molecular mechanism increasing proteome diversity via the assembly of different exons, has been reported to regulate cellular processes in endothelial systems under stress. for example, a splicing isoform of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- <dig>  was proven to activate the eph receptor b <dig>  in response to the early stages of shear stress  <cit> . splicing variants of vascular endothelial growth factor  provide a balance of pro- and anti-angiogenic regulation, and they also act as determinants of tumor angiogenesis  <cit> . importantly, one study has reported that as, like transcription, can enable rapid and specific changes in gene expression in response to stress  <cit> . thus, elucidating the transcriptional and splicing regulation that affects ec survival and apoptosis is critical for a better understanding of endothelial function under physiological and pathological stresses.

although many studies have focused on transcriptional and proteome profiling of ecs under stress  <cit> , no study to date has addressed splicing and multilevel regulation from a genomic standpoint. here, human umbilical vein endothelial cells  were treated with  <dig> μm cocl <dig> for  <dig> hrs to mimic hypoxia  <cit>  and to induce cell apoptosis and alternative splicing responses, as previously described  <cit> . an affymetrix human exon  <dig>  st array system containing over  <dig> million exon clusters and  <dig>  million features was used to profile gene expression at both the transcriptional and splicing levels. after a comparative analysis of expression between treated and normal samples, gene ontology  and protein annotation coupled with pathway analysis provided evidence illustrating the balance between cell survival and apoptosis. furthermore, the classification of splicing patterns and the discovery of a group of genes affected by both transcription and splicing indicated multilevel regulations representing the response of huvecs to stress. our data may facilitate the development of new therapeutic approaches for vascular disease treatment.

RESULTS
analysis of apoptosis in cocl2-treated huvecs
to mimic hypoxia stress, huvecs were incubated with  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> μm cocl <dig> for  <dig> ,  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> hrs. the apoptosis rate of huvecs treated with different concentrations of cocl <dig> was analyzed by flow cytometry . the apoptosis rate rapidly increased as the cocl <dig> concentrations and incubation time increased, although the increase did not occur in a linear fashion. clearly,  <dig> μm cocl <dig> had a minimal effect, as evidenced by persistently low apoptosis rates over time, while  <dig> μm and  <dig> μm cocl <dig> induced high rates of cellular apoptosis earlier. when incubated with  <dig> μm cocl <dig>  huvecs showed a large transition in apoptosis rates, which increased from 14% to 55% between  <dig> and  <dig> hrs. we therefore considered the first  <dig> hrs of huvecs with  <dig> μm cocl <dig> treatment as the early stage of apoptosis.

differentially expressed genes and functional analysis
a comparison of the mimicked hypoxic and normoxic groups identified  <dig> differentially expressed genes , consisting of  <dig>  upregulated and  <dig>  downregulated genes . the number of downregulated genes was  <dig>   times higher than the number of upregulated genes in response to stress. a different strategy of functional analysis  was performed on degs. first, function enrichments of degs were detected based on their protein annotations from the uniprot database  <cit> . interestingly, 24% of the degs were categorized as genes undergoing or regulating alternative splicing . it is equally notable that the other functional categories available for short-term cellular response to hypoxia include nuclear protein, phosphorylation, metal binding, and dna-binding, which are also prominent in enrichment . these categories demonstrate extensive responses of gene regulation to hypoxia. go analysis was then carried out on the up- and downregulated genes respectively. importantly, we found that "programmed cell death"  is only significantly observed in the upregulated genes, which indicates that apoptosis is initiated in response to mimicked hypoxia in huvecs.



alternative splicing events and protein domain analysis
using the "splicing index" algorithm described in the methods,  <dig> probe select regions  labeled as "core" were identified as alternatively spliced exons , and these belonged to  <dig> alternatively spliced transcripts. compared with normal huvecs,  <dig> psrs with higher expression were classified as "general exon inclusion" events, while the other  <dig> psrs with lower expression were considered as "general exon skipping" events. thirty-five percent  of the alternatively spliced transcripts are supported by experimental evidence based on the ncbi refseq database records. since it is possible for multiple alternative splicing events to occur in the same transcript, 13%  of the transcripts were found to contain 25%  of the alternatively spliced exons. therefore, there was an average of  <dig>   alternatively spliced exons per transcript under mimicked hypoxia conditions in our data. a typical example is ubiquitin-associated protein  <dig> , for which five alternatively spliced exons were detected, indicating a complicated pattern of splicing regulation of ubap <dig> in huvecs under hypoxic stress.

it is well known that splicing not only provides feedback to affect transcription, but also feeds forward to modulate protein function. an interproscan search revealed  <dig> protein domains in 21%  of the coding regions of alternatively spliced exons, and  <dig> different domains were revealed after removing the redundant records .

rt-pcr and quantitative real-time pcr validation
in order to confirm the degs detected by exon array,  <dig> degs exhibiting highly significant differences in expression or with important functions  were validated by rt-pcr in figure s <dig> . interleukin  <dig>  and hypoxia-inducible factor  <dig> , two important genes in hypoxia response, were validated by real-time quantitative pcr . consistency was found between the results obtained by rt-qpcr and those acquired by the exon array system . thirty-two differentially expressed exons were selected for validation by rt-pcr. forward and reverse pcr primers were designed adjacent to or spanning several constitutive exons , and half of these primers amplified specific bands of differentially expressed transcripts . furthermore, two genes, hnrpdl  and alas <dig> , are shown in figure  <dig> to compare the results of the exon array system, rt-pcr, and refseq isoform evidence for consistency. positive and negative values of "splicing index" indicate the "exon inclusion" and "exon skipping" events, respectively, in mimicked hypoxia samples compared with controls. in figure 3a, exon  <dig> of the hnrpdl gene is highly included in the condition of mimicked hypoxia, which is consistent with the results of the rt-pcr and refseq isoforms. the situation is true for skipping of exon  <dig> of alas <dig> gene shown in figure 3b. all these results suggest that the exon array system is reliable and effective enough to detect differential expression at both the transcriptional and splicing levels.

analysis of transcription and splicing pathways
the keggchart tool in the david system were used to detect pathways enriched in up- and downregulated genes based on the kegg database. as shown in table  <dig>  the "mapk signaling pathway" and "proteasome" were highly activated, while "focal adhesion" and "regulation of actin cytoskeleton" were largely silenced. however, there was no significant enrichment for alternatively spliced genes in the kegg pathways. we therefore used genmapp to map both degs and alternatively spliced genes simultaneously based on the context of the kegg pathways. interestingly, we found that the "focal adhesion" pathway contained not only  <dig> downregulated genes, but also  <dig> exon inclusion events. genes affected at both the transcription and splicing levels appeared in the "focal adhesion" pathway. five of these genes were simultaneously regulated at both levels .

furthermore, a two-step literature mining strategy was carried out to explore the functional modules from biological networks for the huvecs under mimicked hypoxia conditions. a novel schematic molecular module was generated to illustrate functional modularity within networks . this module contained  <dig> proteins and  <dig> regulatory relationships , of which  <dig> heat shock proteins and one heat shock transcription factor were upregulated, indicating that these heat shock proteins may function synergistically in this module in response to hypoxic stress.

splicing patterns and complex regulation between transcription and splicing
in the distribution of splicing patterns, 48% of as events were considered to be of the "cassette exon" type, which is consistent with another report that "cassette exon" is a kind of splicing pattern with high frequency  <cit> . the "alternative promoter" category comprised 17% of the as events. previous studies have reported that alternative promoters can regulate at both the transcription and splicing levels  <cit> . comparing with a benchmarked exon array data that were also analyzed by the "splicing index" algorithm, we found that the proportions of the splicing patterns observed in huvecs treated with cocl <dig> are different from those in the benchmark dataset  <cit> . the proportion of "cassette exon" is nearly double, while those of all the others decrease . other than the technical differences between the experiments, we hypothesize that the proportion of the splicing patterns may be specific to different phenotypic conditions. for example, the "cassette exon" is more dominant in the stress-induced huvecs than in the benchmarked exon array data. by classifying all as events into "general exon inclusion" events  and "general exon skipping" events  on the basis of exon expression levels, we surprisingly found that the "general exon inclusion" events are highly correlated with the downregulation of the genes, while "general exon skipping" events are highly correlated with the upregulation of the genes .

furthermore, we found that a large proportion of alternatively spliced genes overlapped with degs , and the overlapping genes differentially expressed at both the gene and exon levels. afterwards, a functional analysis similar to table  <dig> was performed on the alternatively spliced genes. interestingly, parallel rankings of functional categories were found between alternatively spliced genes and degs because of the high proportion of overlaps between these two gene sets. the top three categories of alternatively spliced genes  were very consistent with their counterparts at the gene level. we also found that alternatively spliced genes with multiple affected exons were largely included among the overlapping genes . finally,  <dig> alternatively spliced genes were transcription factors supported by the publicly available transfac  <dig>  database .

discussion
functional and pathway analyses support the conflicting balance between huvec survival and apoptosis
consistent with the results of cell apoptosis analysis, the gene function and pathway analyses of degs revealed the conflicting balance between huvec survival and apoptosis. il- <dig>  a gene known to directly promote endothelial cell survival and angiogenesis, has been demonstrated to be highly upregulated based on exon array system and rt-qpcr analysis  <cit> . this suggests that chemokines may play an important role in resisting apoptosis in huvecs. huvec survival may decrease with the expression of thrombospondin- <dig> , which has been reported to induce endothelial cell apoptosis and inhibit angiogenesis  <cit> . on the other hand, yang et al. reported that loss of survivin  increased cellular sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli and caused spontaneous apoptosis  <cit> . our results indicated that downregulation of survivin in huvecs is highly likely to result in apoptosis via this mechanism. it has also been reported that aifm <dig> reduces cell survival signaling and contributes to the onset of apoptosis  <cit> . the observed upregulation of aifm <dig> suggests that this gene also plays a role in promoting cell apoptosis. these gene expression patterns indicated that huvecs struggle to avoid apoptosis in order to survive under stress. in the results of the go analysis, it is notable that the upregulated genes are significantly enriched in the "programmed cell death" functional annotation, demonstrating the ongoing apoptosis of huvecs.

since genes are usually functionally organized into pathways, it is necessary to explore the gene regulation in terms of the pathways involved. as shown in table  <dig>  the "focal adhesion" pathway is largely silenced, which is congruous with the fact that adhesion-dependent endothelial cell survival is regulated by focal adhesion kinase  <cit> . this silenced pathway may result in the disorder of the cellular signaling that mediates the contact between endothelial cells and the extracellular matrix during apoptosis  <cit> . in addition, kulms et al. showed that disruption of the "actin cytoskeleton"  is mediated via the activation of cd <dig>  during the induction of apoptosis  <cit> . with regard to the upregulated pathways, the "mapk signaling" pathway was studied by inducing apoptosis in endothelial cells via phosphorylation  <cit> . the upregulated "antigen processing and presentation" pathway is supported by the expression of many antigens, especially platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule- <dig> , which provides survival signals to suppress apoptosis  <cit> . however, the regulation of the "proteasome" pathway is somewhat complex because proteasome inhibitors have dual functions, either facilitating or inhibiting apoptosis  <cit> . in conclusion, the expression of genes in the examined pathways presents a comprehensive illustration of the state of homeostasis between cell survival and apoptosis.

finally, a novel heat shock protein module composed of the hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and dnaj subfamilies was discovered to underlie the functional modulation of biological networks under stress. these heat shock proteins have been individually demonstrated to resist apoptosis in response to a variety of stimuli including hypoxia  <cit> . figure  <dig> shows that the  <dig> kda heat shock protein 1a  may function together with other heat shock proteins to form a protein complex that more effectively inhibits apoptosis. notably, hspa1a has been reported to confer resistance to apoptosis in conjunction with other heat shock proteins  <cit> , which is consistent with its feature as a hub of the scale-free module. this novel module suggests that heat shock proteins and their collective regulation may be crucial to controlling huvec survival and apoptosis.

complex regulation of transcription and splicing in stress induced huvecs
both dependent and independent regulations of transcription and splicing usually coexist under most physiological and pathological conditions. based on the observation of a higher rate of overlapping between degs and alternatively spliced genes than that found in other studies  <cit> , we expect the possibility of combinatorial regulation between transcription and splicing in stress induced huvecs. although we also found that the general splicing patterns are highly correlated with gene expression levels, the exact molecular mechanism of the coupling regulation is still unknown. we hypothesize that splicing may modify the transcription activity or rna stability  <cit> , while transcription may change the splicing efficiency  <cit> . on one hand, alternative splicing of mrna can change rna stability, which in turn will probably affect the expression levels of the gene transcripts with different rna stability  <cit> . on the other hand, it is also possible that different expression levels of the upstream genes of splicing factors facilitate or inhibit splicing machinery by influencing spliceosome assembly or the cis-elements during the splicing process. these two aspects of regulations could both possibly result in the high degree of correlation between splicing patterns and transcriptional expression. therefore, it is reasonable to speculate that huvecs may utilize the combinatorial regulation of transcription and splicing to modulate the cellular response to stress finely and efficiently.

transcription and splicing may be independent processes, but there are still possible correlations at specific spatiotemporal stages of the cellular response. in our results,  <dig> differentially expressed transcription factors  were detected as alternatively spliced genes. on the other hand,  <dig> splicing factors , including  <dig> sr proteins and  <dig> hnrnp proteins, were detected as degs . the existence of two possible regulatory mechanisms for these transcription factors and splicing factors can be conjectured: 1) the  <dig> alternatively spliced transcription factors are possible targets of splicing factors; 2) the  <dig> differentially expressed splicing factors are possible targets of transcription factors. if the differential expression of splicing factors directly influences the splicing efficiency and in turn triggers the alternative splicing of transcription factors, a loop of feedback regulation can then be established in response to stress. since it is difficult to reveal the exact regulatory mechanisms underlying these trans-factors and their targets, further studies are needed to explain the regulatory model of the complex regulation under stress in the future.

alternative splicing can influence biological networks through domain architectures
since no significant enrichment of alternatively spliced genes was found in the kegg pathways, splicing may follow a different set of regulatory rules than transcription in pathways. alternative splicing can expand the protein repertoire and influence protein function by altering protein domains. melissa et al. reported that  <dig>  of  <dig>  human genes in the ensembl database encoded two or more different proteins. of these,  <dig>  genes encoded proteins with different pfam domain architectures  <cit> . the affected domains in the coding regions of alternatively spliced exons confirmed the existence of changes in the transcriptome and proteome resulting from alterations in the domain architecture of biological networks  <cit> . we found that alternative splicing may influence transcription through the gain or loss of promoter binding domains. for example, the number of zinc finger domains  decreased in zinc finger protein  <dig> , whose transcription factor activity depends on the number of domain repeats. the same phenomenon was also found in the wd- <dig> repeat domain  of the sh3kbp <dig> and rrp <dig> genes. in our results, the dna-binding domain hmg-i  was lost in the high mobility group at-hook  <dig> . previous studies have demonstrated that the domain hmg-i functions as part of a hypoxia-induced enhanceosome, promoting the transcription of cox- <dig> in huvecs  <cit> . defects in the hmg-i dna-binding domain will disorganize the transcriptional regulation under stress. the mam domain  in neuropilin  <dig> , representing adhesive function, may be altered to induce endothelial dysfunction in response to stress. these changes of domains were analyzed based on the coding regions of alternatively spliced exons .

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, huvecs were incubated with  <dig> μm cocl <dig> for  <dig> hrs to induce the balance between cell survival and apoptosis, followed by a genome-wide expression profiling of transcription and splicing by exon array system. functional and pathway analyses of gene levels and exon levels demonstrated the importance of transcription and splicing regulation in cellular processes. evidence from the splicing classifications and the overlap between the two levels suggested a combinatorial regulation. because very few studies have investigated splicing regulation in endothelial cell survival and apoptosis, elucidating the underlying mechanisms associated with these phenomena is critical for a better understanding of vascular biology under normal and pathological conditions.
