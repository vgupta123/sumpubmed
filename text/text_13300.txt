BACKGROUND
japanese encephalitis virus  is the most common cause of epidemic viral encephalitis worldwide, with approximately  <dig>  cases and  <dig>  deaths annually throughout a wide geographical range  <cit> . since the prototype nakayama strain of jev was first isolated in  <dig>  epidemics and sporadic cases of japanese encephalitis have occurred in temperate and tropical zones of asia as well as in non-asian regions, including cambodia, china, indonesia, india, japan, malaysia, myanmar, nepar, sri lanka, thailand, vietnam, the south eastern russian federation, and australia  <cit> .

jev is a member of flaviviridae family, which consists of the genera flavivirus , pestivirus , and hepacivirus . jev is an enveloped, positive-stranded rna virus whose genome consists of a single-stranded rna molecule of approximately  <dig> kb. the rna genome of jev consists of 98-nucleotide  long 5' untranslated region  with the type- <dig> cap structure at its 5' terminus, a single open reading frame , and a 585-nt long 3'-utr with no poly tail at its 3' terminus  <cit> . the single large orf encodes a polyprotein of ~ <dig>  amino acids that is subsequently processed by both host and viral proteases into three structural proteins and seven nonstructural proteins  <cit> . the structural proteins  are contained in the n-terminal third of the polyprotein, while the nonstructural proteins  are located in the c-terminal two-thirds of the polyprotein. ns <dig> is the largest nonstructural protein of jev. analysis of the amino acid sequence of ns <dig> led to the prediction that it carries both methyltransferase and rna-dependent rna polymerase  activities. the 5' rna methyltransferase activity should be located on the n-terminal portion because of the presence of conserved motifs found in other viral methyltransferases  <cit> . the c-terminal region of ns <dig>  which contains the conserved rdrp motifs  <cit>  and the gly-asp-asp  motif found in the active site of many viral rdrps  <cit> , is likely responsible for the rna polymerase activity.

rna synthesis by various rna virus rdrps has been shown to occur by either a de novo initiation mechanism in which first nucleotide serves as a primer to provide the 3'-hydroxyl group, or via a primer- dependent mechanism  <cit> . de novo initiation results in the synthesis of various rdrp products including a template-size product initiated from the most 3'-end or an rna molecule smaller than the template   <cit> . although de novo initiation has been demonstrated for a number of flaviviridae rdrps, including those from wnv, den, kun, bvdv, csfv, and hcv  <cit> , the biochemical properties jev rdrp and its rna synthesis initiation mechanism have not been yet analyzed in detail due to the lack of an in vitro rdrp assay system. in this work, we expressed and purified jev ns <dig> protein from escherichia coli and characterized its biochemical properties and in vitro rna synthesis initiation mechanism.

RESULTS
expression and purification of recombinant jev ns <dig> protein
to investigate the biochemical properties of jev rdrp, recombinant jev ns <dig> protein with a hexahistidine tag at the n-terminus was expressed in e. coli. the e. coli cells transformed with an expression vector containing jev ns5-coding gene were induced with iptg at low temperature  to obtain soluble ns <dig> protein. western blot analysis of the soluble fraction and total lysates with an anti-his antibody detected ~105-kda intact jev ns <dig> proteins along with ~35-kda cleaved form of the ns <dig> . these two proteins were co-purified by nickel affinity chromatography . the proteins were excised from the gel and in-gel digested with trypsin. the resulting peptide mixtures were analyzed by maldi-tof mass spectrometry. both of these proteins were identified as jev ns <dig> protein . the 35-kda c-terminally truncated ns <dig> proteins were successfully removed by subsequent gel filtration chromatography  . the gfc fractions containing the intact form of ns <dig> were further purified by sp-sepharose cation exchange chromatography . the jev ns <dig> mutant protein ns5d668a was also similarly purified. the eluate from the sp-sepharose column contained near homogenous ns <dig> proteins, as shown by silver staining  and western blot analysis .

analysis of the rdrp activity of jev ns5
to test the rdrp activity of the purified recombinant jev ns <dig> protein, we first performed an rna polymerase assay with poly rna template in the absence and presence of primer oligo <dig>  the rdrp activity assay conditions used initially were similar to those for hcv ns5b rdrp  <cit> , except that  <dig>  mm of both mn2+ and mg2+ were added. the rna polymerase activity of jev ns <dig> was only observed in the presence of primer . the gdd motif conserved in most rdrps of plus-strand rna viruses is important for metal binding and is considered to be the catalytic site of the enzyme  <cit> . mutation of the first asp in the gdd motif to ala in ns5d668a resulted in loss of the rdrp activity . these results demonstrated that the recombinant jev ns <dig> rdrp alone is capable of synthesizing rna in vitro without the help of other viral and/or cellular protein.

having identified the rna polymerase activity of the purified ns <dig> protein, we optimized the rdrp assay conditions by using the poly rna/oligo <dig> as a template. the optimal temperature for maximal activity was determined to be 30Â°c . the rdrp activity of jev ns <dig> was found to be optimal at ph of  <dig> ; rapid decrease of activity was observed above ph  <dig> . potassium  ion exhibited a stimulatory effect at  <dig> mm, while the stimulatory effect decreased when the concentration of k+ was higher than  <dig> mm . all known dna and rna polymerases require a divalent cation cofactor for optimal activity  <cit> . divalent metal ions are also essential cofactors for viral rdrps  <cit> . the enzymatic activity of jev ns <dig> was dependent on mn2+ with the optimal concentration being  <dig>  mm . the jev ns <dig> exhibited a strong preference for mn2+ over mg2+ for rna synthesis using the poly/u <dig> substrate . no detectable level of rdrp activity was observed in the presence of the same range of mg2+ concentration as that used for mn2+ . similarly, complete dependence on mn2+ was observed with a jev genome-derived rna template, the 83-nt rna from the 3'-end of jev genome .

de novo initiation of rna synthesis from the plus- and minus-strand 3'-utr of jev genome
cis-acting rna elements required for viral rna replication by various viral rdrps are known to reside at the 3'-end of both plus- and minus-strand viral genomes, thereby allowing initiation of rna synthesis of both polarities. to investigate the rna synthesis initiation mechanism with the purified recombinant jev ns <dig>  we performed rdrp assays with jev genome-derived rna templates, 3'utr and 3'utr rna, that represent the 3'-end of jev plus- and minus-strand rna, respectively. the rna templates were synthesized by in vitro transcription using t <dig> rna polymerase and pcr-amplified dna templates under the control of t <dig> rna polymerase promoter. the recombinant jev ns <dig> was able to use both jev 3'utr and 3'utr rna as templates . rna synthesis from these templates did not require an exogenous primer, indicating that jev ns <dig> can start rna synthesis de novo using a nucleotide as a primer. the major rna product synthesized from the 3' utr co-migrated with the template . in contrast, the major rna products synthesized from the 3'utr rna template migrated slightly slower than the template rna . moreover, through comparison of rna product amounts synthesized from the 3'utr and 3'utr rna template , we found that jev ns <dig> apparently recognized a cis-acting element in the 3'utr more efficiently than the one in the 3'utr for the synthesis of plus-strand jev rna. these results indicated that jev ns <dig> can synthesize rna de novo using jev genome-derived rna templates. the lack of labeled products without an rna template  indicated that the jev ns <dig> preparation was not contaminated with any rnas that could serve as a template. in addition, no rna products were synthesized by the jev ns <dig> mutant ns5d668a, indicating that the ns <dig> protein was not associated with enzymes that can label exogenous rna templates .

in a previous report, jev ns <dig> was shown to bind to the 83-nt stem-loop structure formed with the 3'-terminal region of jev genome, as demonstrated by uv-cross-linking experiments using jev-infected cell extracts  <cit> . we also were able to confirm the direct interaction between the purified ns <dig> and this cis-acting rna element by electrophoretic mobility shift assay . these results prompted us to test whether jev ns <dig> can utilize this 83-nt rna as a template for minus-strand rna synthesis. as expected by its binding ability to the 83-nt rna, ns <dig> could direct rna synthesis to yield a major rdrp product that migrated similarly to the template rna on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel  . there was no generation of rna products bigger than the template, suggesting that ns <dig> does not have a detectable level of tntase activity that would add nucleotide to the 3'-end of the template, under the standard rdrp reaction conditions we used. furthermore, we observed no dimer-size products, suggesting there was no "copy-back" initiation mediated by intramolecular priming. next, we analyzed whether the products synthesized from this minimal rna template are in the single- or double-stranded form. we treated the rna products with nuclease s <dig> under low or high salt conditions and found that they were sensitive to nuclease s <dig> digestion regardless of heat denaturation prior to the nuclease treatment under the low salt  condition . in contrast, the products were almost resistant to nuclease s <dig> under the high salt  condition , which is a favorable condition for forming a stable rna duplex. this result suggested that the most of rdrp products directed by the 83-nt rna template might form a stable rna duplex with the template or with the product itself.

de novo internal initiation of rna synthesis from the 83-nt rna template
to fine map the initiation site of rna synthesis from the 83-nt rna template, we resolved the rdrp-reaction product on a denaturing polyacrylamide sequencing gel  and determined the exact size of the rna product by running in parallel with rna size markers. the result showed that the size of the major product from the 83-nt rna template is 81-nt long, shorter than the template rna , indicating that jev ns <dig> initiated rna synthesis from the internal nucleotide u <dig> of the template, as depicted in fig. 7c. we attempted, without success, to detect 5'-end labeled internally initiated products from the rdrp assays performed in the presence of  atp and all four cold ribonucleotides . the limited amount of  atp  and cold atp , which might be lower than the km value for atp required for efficient initiation of rna synthesis, and less sensitive 5'-end labeling of the internally initiated rna products with single radiolabeled ribonucleotide than the internal labeling at multiple sites with  utp, may explain this failure. therefore, instead of using the -atp incorporation assay, we performed rdrp assays with insertion and deletion mutants of the 83-nt rna, namely  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>   to confirm the internal de novo initiation of rna synthesis. strikingly, the first two derivatives,  <dig> and  <dig>  still directed the synthesis of an 81-nt rna product co-migrating with the rna product synthesized from the wild-type template . deletion of one nucleotide from the 3'-terminal end of the template or addition of one nucleotide to the 3'-end did not alter the size of the reaction product, indicating that rna synthesis initiation did not start from the 3'-end of the template. in contrast, the  <dig> rna  with an additional base pair at the lower part of the stem structure yielded an 83-nt product . these results clearly indicated that the ns <dig> initiates rna synthesis from the u <dig> of the template.

tntase activity of jev ns <dig> protein
recent studies have shown that recombinant hcv ns5b and bvdv ns5b rdrps expressed in e. coli have an intrinsic tntase activity; tntase activity was not an activity of any cellular enzyme co-purified with the recombinant rdrps but an inherent function of the rdrps  <cit> . we set out similar tntase assay conditions as depicted in fig.  <dig>  similar to the previous results shown with hcv and bvdv rdrps, labeled products were detected in the tntase activity assays performed in the presence of  utp and cold utp  or in the presence of  utp as a sole ribonucleotide substrate. under these conditions, recombinant jev ns <dig> synthesized template size and bigger-than-the template products but not the internally initiated 81-nt rna product . consistently, in the standard rdrp reaction condition, jev ns <dig> produced the 81-nt internally initiated rna product . upon longer exposure to detect the tntase activity in the presence cold utp, we observed an additional minor product , which we were not able to detect under routine rdrp product analysis conditions. these results suggest that jev ns <dig> might possess a tntase activity, depending on reaction conditions.

discussion
in this study, we established an in vitro jev rdrp assay system with a functional full-length jev ns <dig> protein and characterized the mechanism of initiation of rna synthesis. results from this study showed that the recombinant jev ns <dig> exhibits both rdrp and tntase activities. the enzyme was capable of synthesizing rna by a primer-dependent manner with a homopolymeric rna template poly and by de novo initiation with the rna templates derived from jev genome. several reports showed that the tntase activity is a common intrinsic property of many rdrps of flaviviridae. the recombinant rdrps of hcv and bvdv have been shown to possess a tntase activity under certain reaction conditions  <cit> . csfv ns5b protein also was shown to possess tntase activity, which added a single nucleotide to the 3' end of the 3'-utr rna template  <cit> . the jev ns <dig> exhibited a weak but detectable level of intrinsic tntase activity only when substrate ribonucleotides were limited . because the tntase activity was detected only when limiting amount of cold utp was added to the reaction mixture, its in vivo function, if any, remains unclear.

the jev ns <dig> has a strong preference for mn2+ over mg2+ ion for rna synthesis . considering that the intracellular concentration of mn2+ is much lower than mg2+  <cit> , the stringent mn2+-dependent rdrp activity of jev ns <dig> may not allow efficient jev replication in vivo. alternatively, this mn2+-dependent rdrp activity might be simply an artifact of the unnatural in vitro conditions. it is also possible that this might be due to conformational difference of the recombinant jev ns <dig> from the one in the virus-infected cells, in which jev ns <dig> was likely to be membrane associated or to form a complex with other viral and/or cellular proteins. nevertheless, similar stringent mn2+-denpedent rna synthesis using the homopolymeric rna template poly has been demonstrated with recombinant rdrps den and wnv  <cit> . furthermore, when a den minigenome consisting of the 5'-end rna  and the 3'-end rna  of the viral genome was used as a template, the den rdrp activity was supported either by mg2+ or mn2+, with the latter cation being a better cofactor. our result is however contradictory to that obtained previously by in vitro rdrp assay using the jev replication complex  isolated from infected cells  <cit> . the rc displayed a strict dependence on mg2+ with absolutely no rdrp products being synthesized from the endogenous viral rnas associated with the rc in the absence of mg2+. the requirement of mg2+ for rna synthesis by jev rc might be due, in part, to its role as a cofactor for other viral and/or cellular proteins associated with the viral rna polymerase.

during the course of flavivirus replication, minus-strand rna is synthesized from the plus-strand genomic rna. this intermediate form of rna serves as a template for the synthesis of plus-strand genomic rna that is synthesized at 10- to 100-fold higher levels than the minus-strand rna  <cit> . results from our in vitro rdrp assays using the 3'utr and 3'utr templates also supported the notion that a greater amount of plus-strand rna than minus-strand rna is synthesized in jev- and den-infected cells  <cit> . the ratio of plus-to-minus strand rna in the cells infected with these viruses was approximately 10: <dig>  as shown in fig. 5c, we demonstrated that the 3'utr served as a better template than the 3'utr for jev ns <dig>  this in vitro result also agreed with the result showing that the hcv ns5b rna polymerase produces rdrp products more efficiently using the 3'utr than the 3'utr of the plus-strand viral rna  <cit> . such preference for plus-strand 3'-utr over minus-strand 3'-utr for rna synthesis initiation might be correlated with the binding activity of rdrps to these cis-acting rna elements. indeed, a recent report showed that csfv ns5b protein, a viral rdrp, recognizes the 3'utr more efficiently than the 3' utr  <cit> . regarding the mechanism of initiation of rna synthesis, jev ns <dig> appears to be able to initiate rna synthesis either de novo or by intramolecular priming in vitro using the viral genome-derived rna templates tested in this work. from the 3'utr, jevns <dig> produced template size rna as a major rdrp product, whereas bigger-than-template products were synthesized from the 3'utr rna template . the nature of this bigger-than-template product is not clear at the present time, although it might be generated by extension of the 3'-end of the template by a snap-back priming mechanism or by extension of the newly synthesized nascent rna products. the long single-stranded region at the 3'-end of the predicted secondary structure of the 3'utr might allow intramolecular priming.

both nucleotide sequence and structure of 3'-utr of plus-strand rna viruses contain a cis-acting signal essential for the initiation of viral rna replication. although the size and sequence of the 3'-utr vary among different flaviviruses, its secondary structure comprising stable stem-loops is predicted to be highly conserved. the last  <dig> to  <dig> nts at the 3'-end of various flavivirus genomes have been predicted to form stable stem-loop structures  <cit> . the last 83-nts of the 3'-utr of jev are predicted to form a stable stem-loop structure , which is similar to that formed with the 3'-end of the kun genome  <cit> . the ability of jev ns <dig> to use the 83-nt rna template as a minimal template allowed us to explore its role in rna synthesis. our results revealed that jev ns <dig> initiates rna synthesis from an internal nucleotide u <dig>  the third nucleotide from the 3'-end of the template . we also observed that, although it is a very minor one, wild-type 83-nt rna ,  <dig>  and  <dig> generated an rna product of 83-nt . because de novo initiated products from the 3'-end of these templates would generate  <dig>   <dig>  and 84-nt product from  <dig>   <dig> wt, and  <dig>  respectively, this product appears to be the 3'-end extended nascent rna. internal initiation of rna synthesis was observed similarly with other flaviviridae rdrps. for example, the penultimate cytidine at the 3'-end of kun plus- and minus-strand rna was shown to be essential for kun rna replication  <cit> . in addition, oh et al.  <cit>  and kim et al.  <cit>  showed that rna synthesis initiates from an internal region of the 98-nt x-rna template at the 3'-end of hcv genome, which is similar in terms of the rna synthesis initiation mechanism to the result shown with jev ns <dig> in this study. because initiation of rna synthesis from an internal nucleotide during viral rna replication will result in loss of 3'-end genetic information, cellular and/or viral factors may play a role in the initiation of rna synthesis from the 3'-end of genome. previously, chen et al.  showed that both jev ns <dig> helicase and ns <dig> bind to the 3'-utr of jev genomic rna. moreover, the 36-kda mov <dig> protein was known to bind the 83-nucleotide 3' stem-loop structure recognized by the ns <dig> protein  <cit> . those known viral and cellular proteins interacting with the 3'-end minimal cis-acting elements as well as other unknown factors might allow for jev ns <dig> protein to initiate rna synthesis from the 3'-end. the recombinant jev ns <dig> protein will permit evaluating the effect of such trans factors on initiation of rna synthesis.

previous studies proposed that the 5' and 3' ends of the flavivirus rna genome are able to interact directly between the cyclization sequence within the 3'-utr and its complementary sequence in the capsid coding region following the 5'-utr of the viral genome  <cit> . the cross-talk between these conserved cis-acting rna elements of various flaviviruses was shown to be required for viral replication  <cit> . in vitro rdrp assays using den-infected cell lysates and recombinant viral rdrp from wnv showed that minus-strand rna synthesis requires the interaction between the two terminal regions on the plus-strand viral rna template through a cyclization motif,  <cit> . these previous results proposed that rna synthesis from the 3'-utr of plus-strand rna requires the 5'-terminal region of the viral genome supplied in cis or trans so that cyclization of the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions forms a pan-handle-like structure. in contrast to in vitro rdrp assay results obtained with the above described flavivirus rdrps, our results demonstrated that jev ns <dig> protein is capable of using the jev 3'utr and the 83-nt rna as templates . rna synthesis from these templates did not require the 5'-terminal cyclization motif in cis or trans. this result suggests that the sequence and/or structure of the 3'utr and the 83-nt rna is sufficient for the ns <dig> to recognize the template and to initiate rna synthesis, and indicates that cyclization of the jev genome is not required for rna synthesis in vitro. thus, it is tempting to speculate that cyclization of the jev rna genome in vivo, if any, via direct rna-rna interaction or indirect interaction through other cellular and/or viral proteins, is involved in viral genome translation.

CONCLUSIONS
we established an in vitro jev rdrp assay system with an enzymatically active recombinant jev ns <dig> protein. this recombinant jev alone was able to recognize the cis-acting elements on both plus- and minus-strand 3'-ends. like some of other flavivirus rdrps, it carries both rdrp and intrinsic tntase activities. its internal do novo rna initiation from the 83-nt rna template suggests that jev rna replicase complex might require viral and/or cellular proteins to direct rna synthesis initiation form the 3'-end in vivo. the recombinant jev ns <dig> protein will facilitate the analysis of the roles of such factors in initiation of rna synthesis. the functional ns <dig> protein will also be useful for the development of target-specific inhibitors of jev replication.
