BACKGROUND
pyruvate decarboxylase  is the enzyme responsible for the non-oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. all characterized pdcs are dependent on the cofactors thiamine diphosphate  and mg2+. a recent study proposed a pdc capable of co-factor independent decarboxylation of pyruvate  <cit> , however this discovery has been refuted  <cit> . although widespread in the plant kingdom and amongst ascomycetous yeasts and fungi, pdcs are comparatively rare in prokaryotes. several of the plant and yeast pdcs have been isolated and characterized, however; by contrast only five bacterial pdcs have been described, namely those from zymomonas mobilis , zymobacter palmae , sarcina ventriculi , acetobacter pasteurianus  and gluconobacter oxydans   <cit> .

in higher organisms and most prokaryotes , the pdc forms part of the fermentative pathway leading to ethanol production. therefore, bacterial pdcs and their hosts have been the focus of extensive characterization and engineering efforts to develop ethanologenic strains  <cit> . in the acetobacteraceae  however, pdc links oxidative lactate assimilation  and ethanol consumption  to the production of acetate, and therefore forms part of oxidative metabolism  <cit> . in g. oxydans, which only has a partial tca cycle, all l-lactate, fructose and mannitol is converted to acetate via the pdc showing its metabolic importance in this organism  <cit> .

although the exact mechanism of thdp dependent decarboxylation has not yet been fully described, it centrally involves the deprotonation of atom c <dig> of the thiazolium ring to yield a corresponding carbanion or ylide  <cit> . the latter nucleophillically attacks the carbonyl group of pyruvate substrate to yield a c2-α-lactylthiamin diphosphate intermediate  <cit> . the enzymes bind thdp in a conformation that places the n4' atom of the aminopyrimidine ring near atom c <dig>  n4' is a strong base in the imino tautomeric state of the aminopyrimidine ring allowing it to deprotonate c <dig> and activate the cofactor. glu <dig>  within hydrogen bonding distance of n <dig> and de-protonated under physiological conditions, was previously thought to induce the amino to imino tautomerization of the aminopyrimidine ring  <cit> . more recent studies of the pre-reaction state of zmpdc, however, suggest that glu <dig> instead directly abstracts a proton from n4'  <cit> . decarboxylation of the lactyl cofactor adduct yields an enamine/carbanion mesomeric intermediate with concomitant co <dig> release. the carbanion/enamine intermediate becomes protonated to give hydroxyethyl thdp and release of the acetaldehyde product regenerates the ylide  <cit> . crystal structures for pdcs from z. mobilis  and a. pasteurianus  are published  <cit> .

gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus, a member of the family acetobacteraceae, is a gram negative, obligate aerobic bacterium. this organism is also nitrogen fixing and endophytic, setting it apart from other acetic acid bacteria. it is often found in association with sugar cane where it stimulates plant growth through the secretion of auxin-like compounds, notably indole acetic acid   <cit> . no indolepyruvate decarboxylases could be identified on the g. diazotrophicus pal <dig> genome sequence, however several decarboxylases were identified, one of which is possibly responsible for production of iaa from indole-3-pyruvate  <cit> . of these, one showed significant sequence similarity to other true bacterial pdcs and although the role of pdc has been investigated in two other members of this family , its role in this unique bacterium is not known.

as described, the enzyme fulfills multiple roles in key metabolic pathways and has potential for use in engineering of ethanologenic strains. in order to confirm the annotated sequence as a true pdc and to further elucidate the role of the enzymes in these plant-associated organisms, we kinetically characterized the pdc from g. diazotrophicus  and solved the gdpdc crystal structure at  <dig>  Å, adding to our knowledge of these rare enzymes.

RESULTS
functional characterization of the g. diazotrophicus pdc
a search against the non-redundant ncbi database using the gdpdc protein sequence as query identified only  <dig> bacterial proteins , despite the wealth of sequence data available, including metagenomic sequences. pdcs with identity to the bacterial enzymes which have been studied and which are not of acetobacteraceae origin are few . all bacterial proteins related to gdpdc that are annotated as pdcs are shown in figure  <dig>  and included are the indole-3-pyruvate decarboxylase from enterobacter cloacae and the benzoyl-formate decarboxylase from pseudomonas putida for reference, as well as the best blast hit against the non-redundant ncbi environmental metagenomic proteins database. the same sequences are identified when using any of the five gram negative pdcs as search query. the proteins related to the gram negative pdcs from bacteria other than the acetobacteraceae include putative enzymes from the family or order: chroococcales, oscillatoriales , alteromonadaceae, legionellaceae , chloroflexi, acidobacteriaceae, and beijerinckiaceae.figure  <dig> 
neighbor-joining tree comparing full length amino acid sequences of pdc-related proteins. the optimal tree with the sum of branch length =  <dig>  is shown. the percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test  is shown next to the branches  <cit> . the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. the evolutionary distances were computed using the poisson correction method  <cit>  and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site . the analysis involved  <dig> amino acid sequences. all ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. there were a total of  <dig> positions in the final dataset. gdpdc - g. diazotrophicus ; gopdc - g. oxydans ; appdc acetobacter pasteurianus ; zppdc - z. palmae ; zmpdc - z. mobilis ; zmpdc - z. mays ; scpdc - s. cerevisiae ; svpdc - s. ventriculi ; lyngbya aestuarii ; acidomonas methanolica ; acetobacter pomorum ; acetobacter aceti ; microcystis aeruginosa ; moorea producens ; microbulbifer variabilis ; legionella pneumophila ; mdm ; ktedonobacter racemifer ; komagataeibacter oboediens ; komagataeibacter hansenii ; komagataeibacter europaeus ; granulicella tundricola ; gluconobacter thailandicus ; gluconobacter morbifer ; gluconobacter frateurii ; gluconacetobacter xylinus ; gluconacetobacter medellinensis ; fluoribacter dumoffii ; enterobacter cloacae ipdc ; commensalibacter intestini ; beijerinckia indica ; pseudomonas putida bfd  ; mdm- mine drainage metagenome .



g. diazotrophicus pdc was amplified, cloned and sequenced. pcr amplification introduced one amino acid change, p554q, four residues from the end of the chain. as c-terminal deletions after this position do not affect activity for zmpdc, this substitution is not expected to affect enzyme activity substantially  <cit> . of the characterized pdc’s, the amino acid sequence of gdpdc is most closely related to that of z. palmae pdc sharing amino acid identity of 71%, followed by 70% to pdc from a. pasteurianus. the protein shares the typical thdp binding motif gdgs-xxx-nn and retains conserved residues for substrate binding and catalysis .

gdpdc was purified to homogeneity by affinity chromatography as judged by reducing sds-page analysis . the mw of ±60 kda corresponds well to the theoretical molecular mass of  <dig>  kda. the predicted pi is  <dig> . the kinetic parameters of the enzyme are summarized in table  <dig>  the km value for pyruvate decreased ~20-fold on decreasing the ph from  <dig> to  <dig> and at ph  <dig> this value is twofold lower than the lowest km reported for any pdc at this ph  <cit> . the catalytic rate  remains unaffected similar to related enzymes table  <dig>  <cit>  supporting the idea that pdc requires the de-protonation of the thdp aminopyrimidine ring for catalysis  <cit> . the enzyme displays michaelis menten kinetics with pyruvate as substrate and is not subject to allosteric substrate activation, as for the pdcs from plants, fungi, and the bacterium s. ventriculi  <cit> . catalytic efficiencies were also similar to those reported for svpdc, the only known representative from a gram positive bacterium, and zmpdc which is the best studied enzyme.table  <dig>

its temperature optimum is between 45°c and 50°c , one of the lowest for bacterial pdcs. gdpdc is less thermostable than pdcs from other gram negative bacterial enzymes, retaining 15% activity after 30 min at 60°c  and no residual activity after 1 h at 60°c. the activation energy of gdpdc on pyruvate was determined in the linear range from 25°c to 45°c to be 46 kj/mol, which is in agreement with values reported for other bacterial pdcs . the alanine, cysteine and phenylalanine content of pdcs was previously proposed to correlate with its thermostability  <cit> . alanines constitute 17% of the residues in gdpdc  but 12% in gopdc , 15% in zmpdc , 13% in zppdc , 13% in appdc  and  <dig> % in svpdc . despite having the highest alanine content of all the bacterial pdcs, gdpdc is not the most thermostable, contradicting amino acid-based predictions  <cit> . other factors might contribute to the lower in vitro thermostability of gdpdc observed here, as has been summarized in a comparative study conducted by pohl and coworkers  <cit> . for example, the use of mgcl <dig> instead of mgso <dig> to provide the mg2+ cofactor may affect thermostability as the sulfate anion is known to stabilize pdc enzymes  <cit> .figure  <dig> 
gdpdc characterization data. a) the temperature  and ph  profiles of gdpdc using pyruvate as substrate. the assay is described in the methods section. 100% activity is analogous to a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg for topt and  <dig> u/mg for phopt. b) thermal inactivation gdpdc at 25°c , 40°c , 55°c  and 60°c . enzyme activity at zero time using the standard assay at 25°c is set to 100%, analogous to a specific activity of  <dig> u/mg. assays were performed in 200 mm citrate buffer at ph  <dig>  and pyruvate as substrate. the data represents the average of at least three individual rounds of protein purification and assay.



gdpdc was assayed using a range of substrates including 2-ketopropanoate , 2-ketobutanoate, 2-ketopentanoate, 2-keto-4-methylpentanoate, 3-phenyl-2-oxopropanoate, benzoyl formate, 3-hydroxy-phenyl pyruvate and indole-3-pyruvate. specific activities for substrates 2-ketobutanoate , 2-ketopentanoate  and 2-keto-4-methylpentanoate , respectively at 24 mm, are similar to those previously reported for other bacterial pdc’s  <cit> . activities for benzoyl formate, 3-hydroxy-phenyl pyruvate and indole-3-pyruvate, if present, were below detection limits.

gdpdc crystallized in the monoclinic space group c <dig> with cell dimensions: a =  <dig>  Å, b = <dig>  Å, c =  <dig>  Å, β =  <dig> °, with two monomers per asymmetric unit . the crystal structure of the g. diazotrophicus pdc was solved by molecular replacement using a side-chain cropped dimer of the a. pasteurianus pdc  as a search model. the high resolution diffraction data  and the good quality of the electron density distribution allowed for facile model building for the major part of the protein  and most residues are well-defined.table  <dig>

the quaternary structure of gdpdc is a homo-tetramer best described as a dimer of dimers  as for zmpdc and appdc. the tetramer is generated by applying a crystallographic 2-fold symmetry to the non-crystallographic dimer in the asymmetric unit. the accessible surface area of the monomer-monomer interface amounts to 3740 Å <dig>  somewhat smaller than the 4150 Å <dig> for zmpdc  <cit>  but similar to that of appdc . the surface area between the dimers of the tetramer is 2738 Å <dig> for gdpdc, 3784 Å <dig> for zmpdc and 3812 Å <dig> for appdc. gdpdc has  <dig> hydrogen bonds between monomers, fewer than the  <dig> for zmpdc but more than the  <dig> of appdc. thirteen salt bridges support the monomer-monomer interface . there is significantly less hydrogen bonding between dimers which make up a tetramer at  <dig> compared with zmpdc- <dig> and apapdc- <dig>  while the number of salt bridges also shows some variation with gdpdc having  <dig>  zmopdc- <dig> and apapdc- <dig> figure  <dig>

the refined crystal structure contains two identical chains of  <dig> amino acids , each binding a thdp cofactor and a mg2+ ion. the model contains  <dig> water molecules. the rmsd for cα atoms of the two monomers in the asymmetric unit is only  <dig>  Å indicating a very high similarity and correspondingly a negligible effect of inter-monomer or crystal packing forces. as for other pdcs, each protein monomer may be thought of consisting of three distinct structural domains: the pyrimidine binding , the regulatory  and the pyrophosphate binding  domains. the rmsd between cα atoms of gdpdc and appdc is  <dig>  Å implying largely similar structures.

as mentioned, gdpdc demonstrated michaelis menten kinetics. two residues, tyr <dig> and arg <dig>  were shown to be involved in binding a second molecule of the substrate analogue pyruvamide in saccharomyces cerevisiae pdc , and are conserved in svpdc; both enzymes display substrate activation  <cit> . arg <dig>  is conserved in a range of pdc-like enzymes based on structure- and sequence-based alignments , however tyr <dig> is not and appears to be unique to the enzymes showing substrate activation.figure  <dig>

one of two thdp molecules in the gdpdc structure appears to be modified as also reported for the zmpdc, based on weak electron density for the c <dig> carbon atom of the thiazolium ring. as for zmpdc, degradation of the cofactor presumably occurs after crystallization  <cit> ; figure 3b.

residues 104– <dig> together with residues 290– <dig>  in the structure of scpdc , are presumably involved in closing the active site during catalysis, as they are disordered, but adopt a stable conformation upon binding the substrate analogue pyruvamide   <cit> . in gdpdc these residues are well defined in the electron density map despite the absence of substrate, also as reported for zmpdc. this may be due to stabilizing interactions with residues of the r- and pp-domains . binding of the inactive thdp triazole ring analogue and pyruvate induce dramatic conformational changes in zmpdc  <cit> . similar conformational changes would presumably also occur in gdpdc as this region is structurally highly conserved in bacterial pdcs . a “water tunnel” links the two active sites  presumably to serve as a proton relay system as previously suggested for zmpdc and the e <dig> subunit of pdhc  <cit> .figure  <dig>

apart from differences in amino acid sequence, zmpdc and gdpdc differ structurally in several areas . in zmpdc a loop of five amino acids  in the pp-domain extends toward the pp-domain of the second subunit creating a number of stabilizing interactions in particular through tyr502a . tyr502a intercalates between tyr468b and phe <dig> involving extensive π-π stacking interactions to the former and van der waals interactions to the latter. in addition, tyr502a forms a c-h•••π interaction to asn466b and a hydrogen bond between its oh group and both asn466b-o and ile539b-n, as well as a hydrogen bond between its main-chain n and asn486b-oδ <dig>  further interactions include a hydrogen bond from asp503a to tyr468b and a salt bridge between asp503a and lys485b. in gdpdc this loop is shorter by four amino acids, foregoing all the described stabilizing interactions, possibly contributing to the lower thermal stability of this protein. interestingly, the situation in gdpdc is similar to that in appdc , which displays higher thermostability .

a second region which is clearly different involves the  <dig> residues linking the pp- and r-domains in gdpdc . this stretch is clearly defined in all three structures, however the positioning of this region differs substantially between the three structures implying unique stabilization details in each. the linker can thus potentially affect both enzyme stability and activity, but in a more subtle way.

the linker connecting the r- and pyr-domains of gdpdc  is not defined in the electron density of both symmetrically independent monomers implying it to be highly disordered. the corresponding residues have therefore not been included in the final model. in crystal structures of zmpdc and appdc these residues are well defined and are stabilized through contacts to other residues in the r- and pyr-domains clearly stabilizing the linker region. interestingly this seven-residue linker contains three proline residues which likely add rigidity to the region  <cit> . however, proline has been shown to be one of the preferred amino acids in domain linker regions, and they are thought to structurally isolate the linker from the protein domains as they have no hydrogen bond to donate, perhaps, as in this case, leading to a flexible linker rather than one rigidified by the proline residues  <cit> . disorder in flexible regions of other pdcs  has been linked to a physiological role, and disorder in linker regions of proteins often indicates a physiological significance  <cit> .

discussion
we have characterized the sixth bacterial pdc, from the acetic acid bacterium g. diazotrophicus, and solved its resting state structure. our analysis indicates the substrate range of the enzyme to be similar to that of other gram negative pdcs with regards to substrate recognition and decarboxylation, showing a preference for short-chain aliphatic 2-keto acids  <cit> . the significantly higher kcat/km for pyruvate compared with the nearest analogues 2-ketobutanoate and 2-ketopentanoate, and the retention of ile <dig>  proposedly crucial for substrate specificity, implies that this enzyme favors pyruvate as its physiological substrate. it can hence be considered a bona fide pyruvate decarboxylase  <cit> . furthermore, as gdpdc does not have any detectable activity on indole-3-pyruvate, it may be ruled out as a contributor to iaa production in g. diazotrophicus pal <dig> 

the ph dependence of km and therefore kcat/km for this class of enzymes is well documented  <cit> . gdpdc appears to behave in much the same way as its gram-negative counterparts in terms of kinetic behavior, displaying the same ph dependence of km, with a 20-fold improvement from ph  <dig> to ph  <dig>  while catalytic efficiency remains largely the same due to only a small change in kcat  over the same ph range . although the minimum specific activity for gdpdc with pyruvate as substrate, is nine times lower compared with the maximum specific activity reported for zmpdc, the lower km at ph  <dig> means that the catalytic efficiency  at this ph is comparable to the highest reported values for zmpdc   <cit> .

a ph optimum of  <dig>  for gdpdc  is similar to those of other bacterial pdcs, and also agrees with the ph optimum for growth of its host  <cit> . g. diazotrophicus is an obligate sugarcane endosymbiont which grows optimally at ph  <dig> , which is also the ph of sugarcane sap  <cit> . it seems possible therefore that the gdpdc has evolved to perform best at the physiological ph of the plant sap environment. whether the g. diazotrophicus intracellular ph is similar to that of the sugarcane sap is yet to be determined. however, it has been shown that for other aerobic acetogenic bacteria, such as acetobacter aceti, they are unable to maintain an internal ph above that of its external environment resulting in an acidic intracellular environment  <cit> . perhaps a similar scenario is true for g. diazotrophicus, applying selective pressure for the pdc to perform at this physiological ph  <cit> . there are only four other characterized enzymes from g. diazotrophicus. one of these is a secreted levansucrase which has an optimal ph at  <dig>  while the other two enzymes, a membrane bound alcohol dehydrogenase has an optimum of  <dig> and a nitrogenase at ph <dig>  <cit> . it has also been shown that plant pdc expression is induced in response to lowered ph caused by oxygen stress  <cit> . in g. diazotrophicus the pdc is divergently transcribed from a lysr-like regulator with 98 bp between the translational start of both genes, suggesting that pdc expression is regulated and is not constitutively expressed. it would therefore be of interest to determine if expression of gdpdc is also ph or oxygen dependent. if g. diazotrophicus, however; does not maintain an acidic intracellular environment, then the optimum ph could suggest the possibility that the pdc performs a role outside the bacterial cell in support of plant cell metabolism under oxygen stress.

as discussed, the low km for pyruvate at ph  <dig> suggests that if it functions mainly at or near this ph, gdpdc would be an extremely good pyruvate scavenger under physiological conditions. the structure of gdpdc aligns well to the related pdcs from a. pasteurianus and z. mobilis with small rmsd’s for cα positions indicating high structural conservation for these enzymes. the lower thermostability of gdpdc  <cit>  is presumably due to the smaller number of hydrogen bonds and salt bridges between monomers compared to the enzymes from z. mobilis and a. pasteurianus  <cit> . molecular dynamic studies comparing the structures of the three bacterial pdcs at different temperatures could shed light on the nature of thermostability differences observed  <cit> . the enzyme does not exhibit significant biochemical or structural differences to its gram negative counterparts, and indicates that there may be strong selective pressure to maintain the biochemical and structural properties of these enzymes in a narrow range across the range of microorganisms it has been identified in. its reduced thermostability and lower topt likely reflects the physical conditions under which gdpdc has been selected for, resulting from the mesophilic endosymbiotic relationship.

there is obvious biotechnological potential for this class of enzyme in engineering of ethanologenic strains as well as in engineering of transgenic crops capable of surviving adverse conditions  <cit> . the bacterial enzymes which, apart from the s. ventriculi enzyme, are not affected by substrate activation and which have higher thermostabilities and activities compared with their yeast and plant counterparts are particularly attractive. towards ethanologenesis, the dual function pyruvate ferrodoxin oxidoreductase/pyruvate decarboxylase enzymes from several thermophilic archaea have been described, opening the possibility of using these for thermophilic ethanologenesis. some of their biochemical characteristics however , make them unsuitable for engineering of certain ethanologenic strains that operate under microaerobic conditions  or low temperature   <cit> . considering the rarity of true pdcs and their narrow functionality, it seems unlikely that a thermophilic variant exists in nature. we propose that, as with most industrially used enzymes, the ideal pdc can only be generated through engineering, and perhaps these two groups of enzymes represent good starting points.

a picture is emerging that the organisms containing these enzymes are strongly plant associated, in which the environment contains ethanol and a lowered ph; ideal conditions for the pdc to play a key role in metabolism. the rarity of these enzymes therefore appears to be due to the pdc only being of significant metabolic importance in these environments. however, the small range of niches they occupy also puts selective pressure on them to adopt characteristics that fall in a similarly narrow range. g. diazotrophicus is an obligate plant endophyte, shown to fix dinitrogen, produce plant growth hormones and protect plants against pathogens such as xanthomonas albilineans  <cit> . it is expected that the role of the pdc enzyme in g. diazotrophicus is to convert pyruvate to acetaldehyde. however, the reason for doing so , whether it is part of the central metabolic pathways or selectively expressed under altered physiological states, perhaps in support of its symbiotic host, remains to be determined. the metabolic importance of pdcs in acetic acid bacteria has been described for two of the members from this family, a. pasteurianus and g. oxydans. in both cases pdc plays an important role in oxidative metabolism  <cit> . the rarity of bacterial pdcs together with their importance in oxidative metabolism in these bacteria, suggests that the enzyme is retained only as a necessity and not as an accessory function. the retention of the enzyme in g. diazotrophicus therefore implies importance of the enzyme, however perhaps not in oxidative metabolism. four proteomic studies looking at global and differential gene expression in g. diazotrophicus in pure culture versus when grown in association with sugarcane plantlets did not identify the pdc as an expressed enzyme  <cit> . it could either be that pdc levels are below the detection limit of these experiments, or that the gene is not expressed under the conditions of the experiment . it was recently proposed that acetic acid bacteria, although being described as obligate aerobic organisms, have the molecular machinery  to enable them to thrive under microaerobic conditions  <cit> . although speculative, should the g. diazotrophicus pdc be shown to further help plants cope with oxygen stress, by operating in a fermentative manner, this would further deepen the symbiotic relationship between these two organisms to the point where g. diazotrophicus could almost be considered a “plant organelle”.

CONCLUSIONS
understanding the various roles that pyruvate decarboxylases play in their hosts is of importance not only from a fundamental biology point of view, but as is the case with g. diazotrophicus, perhaps also of economic importance. here we show the enzyme from g. diazotrophicus is very similar to those from other gram negative bacterial hosts, however what role it plays in this host remains to be elucidated. this study opens the door to further exploration of the role the enzyme plays in its host as well as contributing to our knowledge of these rare enzymes.
