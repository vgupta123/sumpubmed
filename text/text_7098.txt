BACKGROUND
there is overwhelming evidence supporting the concept that only a specific group of cells, among the cellular heterogeneity of a tumor, possesses self-renewal and multilineage differentiation potential and is, therefore, responsible for tumor development <cit> . these cells, so called "tumor initiating cells"  or "cancer stem cells" , have been documented in most circulating and solid tumors as well as in numerous established cancer cell lines <cit> . the expression of adult stem cell surface markers  as well as the expression of specific embryonic stem cell genes  is one of the hallmarks of the tic  <cit> . tics also display increased potential for anchorage-independent growth, capacity to form spheroids in vitro, and propensity to undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition. nevertheless, in the current paradigm, the gold standard property of a tic is its ability to initiate and generate a tumor in immunodeficient mice. due to their properties, tumor initiating cells are thought to be responsible for cancer chemo-resistance and relapse, and thus they represent a significant concern for cancer prognosis and therapy <cit> .

the isolation of tics is based on the expression of specific cell surface markers, the ability to pump out hoechst dye , the high aldehyde dehydrogenase  <dig> activity or the ability to grow in vitro as unattached spheroids in an appropriate medium  <cit> . furthermore, we and others have recently proposed that invasion ability could be also used for the enrichment of tics  <cit> . the isolation of neural stem cells and the propagation of "neurospheres" was the first breakout in the culture of adult stem cells  <cit> . neurospheres are relatively undifferentiated stem cell clones and mounting data have validated their use as a self-renewal model. using neurosphere culture strategies, unattached clusters of cells with tic properties, called 'prostatospheres' , have been grown from both malignant and non-malignant prostate tissue  <cit> . the isolation and culture of tics as pss represents a convenient model for their study, since we currently lack universal tic surface markers, and because it allows the propagation of tics in their undifferentiated state. however, it remains to be determined to what extent sphere culture selectively enriches for tics. likewise, the molecular and cellular basis of ps growth, as well as it relevance for tic biology, have not been analyzed in depth.

various signaling pathways, including wnt, notch, hh and pi3k/akt, have been associated with tics  <cit> . most of these pathways have previously been found to be active in both embryonic and cancer cells. in particular, canonical notch pathway activation has been reported in normal adult stem cells  <cit>  and malignancies  <cit> , and has recently been connected to self-renewal of tics  <cit> . notch signaling starts with a direct interaction between cell surface ligands and notch membrane receptor, followed by cleavage of the notch intracellular domain  and its translocation to the nucleus where it interacts with csl/rbpj transcription factor and triggers the transcription of notch target genes  <cit> . in addition, notch signaling is relevant in prostate gland development, neoplasia and possible for prostate tics  <cit> .

here we show that stem cell medium  supplemented with knockout™sr serum replacement  promotes the growth and serial passage of clonally derived pss. this culture method is suitable not only for established cell lines but also for prostate cancer stem cell primary cultures , providing a valuable model for the integrated study of patient and cell line material. the tic nature of pss is supported by their increased tumorigenicity in mouse xenograft studies, as well as by their increased expression of several established stem cell markers.

in the search for the molecular basis of ps growth we performed genome expression studies using microarrays. we found that the promoters of the genes modulated in pss are enriched in binding sites for known tic transcription factors, such as c-myc and tcf <dig>  thereby reinforcing their tic nature. we also identified  <dig> ps regulated genes that are common to lncap and pcscs, and highlighted interesting molecules that have recognized roles in developmental processes, tissue remodeling, cell invasion and stem cell niche. meta-analysis in oncomine prostate datasets indicates that  <dig> of the  <dig> genes in this signature correlate with prostate cancer status. these genes could, therefore, represent prostate csc markers that have still uninvestigated roles in tic biology.

finally, the overexpression of jag <dig> in the ps signature, lead us to study the contribution of the notch pathway to ps biology. we uncovered an overexpression of several notch signaling genes, an increase in csl/rbpj activity in pss, as well as a reduction of sphere formation as a result of gamma secretase inhibition. this evidence supports a role for the notch pathway in ps maintenance. in conclusion, our findings support the use of ps cultures in scm-1%ko as a model for tic propagation and isolation that unifies cell lines and primary culture systems, and exposes new molecular actors that might be relevant for tic biology and prostate cancer progression.

RESULTS
scm-1%ko supports monoclonal ps growth from cd44+cd24-tics and the total cell line
critical to the study of the tic populations within tumors is the establishment of cultureconditions that allow putative tics to exhibit symmetric  and asymmetric  cell divisions. in order to find a comprehensive medium for the growth and maintenance of prostate tics, we tested the ability of various media and serum replacements developed for embryonic and mesenchymal stem cell research, to support ps growth . we found that scm supplemented with 1% ko, promoted the formation of spheres in lncap as well as other prostate cell lines . in order to determine whether the ps initiating cells represent the previously characterized tics isolated by surface markers  <cit> , lncap cd44+24-stem cell population was sorted and cultured in sphere forming conditions. as shown in figure 1a, depleted lncap cells  attach to the flask as a monolayer whereas cd44+24-cells grow as spheres in scm. addition of 1% ko supplement causes an increase in the proliferation rate of the cd44+24-spheres, as indicated by the augmented diameter of the spheres.

when the bulk lncap cell line was cultured in scm-1%ko medium, we observed the growth of spheres morphologically similar to those originating from the cd44+cd24-subpopulation . after day  <dig>  the cultures displayed a mixed population of adherent cells similar to those grown in rpmi-1640-10% fbs, and pss  . indeed, pss could be serially passaged without a decrease in the percentage of sphere forming cells, which denotes the preservation of their self-renewal potential. qrt-pcr analysis of some stem cell genes  indicated maintenance of their expression along at least eight generations . therefore, this culture condition seems to allow for the enrichment in tic spheres from the total lncap cell line.

in order to distinguish between cell aggregation and clonal origin of these pss, we carried out cell tracing experiments. single cell suspensions were stained with two different dyes in separate reactions and then mixed in equivalent amounts and cultured in scm-1%ko for  <dig> days. following cell up-take, these two dyes become covalently linked to thiol groups in the cytosol and segregate with the cytoplasm. at day  <dig>  the vast majority of the spheres have only one type of fluorescence, indicating that they have a single cell origin . two-colored spheres probably arose from peripheral adhesion of small strongly-stained dead cells. this experiment demonstrates that our culture conditions promote the clonal growth of prostatospheres.

scm-1%ko supports monoclonal ps growth from cd133+tics isolated from primary cultures
subsequently, we performed a similar study with three primary prostate cancer stem cells isolated from recurrent prostate tumors of 55-, 56- and 70-year old patients that underwent chemotherapy and radiation therapy prior to tumor extraction. thereafter, the tumor cells were disaggregated and tic were sorted for expression of the adult stem cell marker prominin <dig>  . all three pcscs grow as epithelial monolayers in the commercial media, express the tic markers cd <dig>  cd <dig>  nanog, oct3/ <dig>  bmi <dig> and exhibit aldh activity  and anchorage independent growth . additionally, they are highly tumorigenic in nod/scid mice, with  <dig> cells producing tumors in all animals in less than eight weeks . these properties are consistent with pcscs containing a tic subpopulation.

the three primary cell cultures also form spheres when cultured in scm-1%ko . although the proportion of stem cell markers and the anchorage independent growth  correlate with tumorigenicity, the similarity in sphere forming capacity suggests that it correlates to a lesser extent. cell tracing experiments demonstrated that pcsc's pss are also monoclonal . all three pcsc were passaged weekly for more that  <dig> generations . as shown in figure 2d pcscs gained sphere-forming capacity along the generations. furthermore, several stem cell markers were shown to be progressively up-regulated along consecutive passages. this data indicate that scm-1%ko medium not only sustains the growth of primary pcscs but also positively selects for tics during passages.

pss are more tumorigenic than the parental cell lines
in order to determine if pss grown in scm-1%ko have increased tumorigenic ability, as it would be expected for tics, we compared the tumorigenicity of the pss and the parental cultures. lncap pss grown in scm-1%ko for one week generate palpable tumors in nod/scid mice in approximately four weeks in 5/ <dig> animals . that is seven times faster than what was reported by our group before  <cit> . likewise, purified pcsc pss grown for one week in scm-1%ko have an increased ability to form tumors than their parental counterparts . this difference in tumorigenicity seems to be indirectly proportional to tumorigenicity and stem cell marker expression of the parental cell lines. for instance, pcsc- <dig> parental culture is the least aggressive in mice  and the one that has the lowest expression of tic markers . simultaneously, it shows the largest difference in tumorigenicity between pss and parental cell culture  as well as the fastest increase in stem cell gene expression , suggesting that it undergoes a strong selection for tics in this culture condition. likewise, the pcsc- <dig> phenotype indicates the highest tic content , but no difference in tumorigenicity between adherent cultures and the pss . in that case, a reduction in the number of injected cells would likely be necessary to detect enrichment in tic in the pss.

in summary, the mice xenograft experiments demonstrate that ps culture enriches in tics both in lncap as well as in pcscs.

gene expression analysis of prostatospheres and differentiated cells
the discovery of the molecular pathways that are required for the maintenance of self-renewing tics may ultimately lead to targeted therapies against this unique population of tumor cells. in order to identify the molecular basis of ps biology, we carried out whole genome gene expression analysis using microarrays. microarray data were deposited in geo . gene expression profiles of prostatospheres growing in scm-1%ko for  <dig> days were compared to the parental cell line growing in the commercial medium containing 10% fbs.

several genes that were previously reported to be related to tic maintenance were found to be up-regulated in scm-1%ko cultured pss . microarray analysis shows that cdh <dig>  prom <dig> and itgb <dig> are upregulated in both lncap and pcscs. although not detected by microarrays, further qrt-pcr assessment also showed that nes and nanog are significantly upregulated in both . ar is downregulated in the pss derived from the androgen-dependant/sensitive lncap cell line. for pcscs, the ar protein was undetectable by western blots although expression of ar mrna was measurable by qrt-pcr . due to previously published reports on prom <dig> and sox <dig> expression in prostate progenitor cell  <cit>  we also addressed their gene expression levels . the changes in stem cell markers identified by microarray were further confirmed by qrt-pcr . therefore, our gene expression study confirms that pss preferentially express already described, as well as potentially novel, tic genes.

due to the enormous interest in the use of well established cell lines as model systems for cancer stem cell research, we sought to find the commonalities between lncap pss and the primary prostate cultures by gene expression analysis. we found a total of  <dig> genes similarly and significantly  modulated in all three pcscs and  <dig> in lncap ps. among these, only  <dig> were regulated in the same direction in both the pcscs and lncap gene lists. in table  <dig>  the genes are classified according to their function and the average fold-change observed in pcscs and lncap is also shown. in order to confirm the microarray data, four genes were assessed by qrt-pcr . although changes in the abundance of individual mrnas may explain a particular biological situation, the concerted action of a group of genes is a more robust means to understand the molecular processes and regulators that drive a given phenotype  <cit> . core analysis of the  <dig> gene signature in ingenuity pathways analysis  yielded cell death and cellular movement as the two top categories , followed by cancer and reproductive system disease  . in addition, most of the tissue specific categories found in this analysis represent mesodermal derived tissues  .

prostatospheres classified by their function.

in order to predict which transcription factors might be responsible for the maintenance of the spheroid state, we used the molecular signatures database  to search overrepresentation of transcription factor binding sites in the promoters of the ps genes modulated ≥2-fold at p ≤  <dig>  . of the five common tf predictions , myc and tcf3/e2a, myod and yy <dig> are well known somatic stem cell transcription factors, whereas the function of repin <dig> is still unknown. canonical wnt pathway transcriptional regulators  and other myc associated tfs  were also found to be overrepresented in the promoter regions of the specific ps datasets .

meta-analysis for correlations of ps genes and prostate cancer status and progression
since tics are proposed to be fundamental for tumor maintenance, invasion, metastasis and drug resistance, we investigated if the  <dig> ps genes were correlated to prostate cancer status or progression using the oncomine database analysis tool  <cit> . we interrogated the  <dig> gene list in all prostate cancer studies available in oncomine. interestingly,  <dig> out of the  <dig> genes are correlated with prostate cancer in at least one prostate cancer profiling study . furthermore, the vast majority of these genes associate with prostate cancer in more than one study, which reinforces their putative significance for this disease. tmp <dig> and galnt <dig> display the most significant correlation among the list, as indicated by the intensity of the colors of the corresponding boxes. only the downregulated genes correlate with tumor stage and grade. the finding of these numerous significant correlations with the clinical set underscores the importance of our ps signature for prostate cancer status and progression.

notch pathway is upregulated in pss and may contribute to ps maintenance
the significant increase in jag <dig> expression observed in our microarray analysis, and subsequently confirmed by qrt-pcr , together with the well documented role of the notch pathway in the maintenance of "stemness", lead us to study the involvement of this pathway in scm-1%ko ps growth and maintenance  <cit> . initially, we queried the microarrays for genes that belong to the canonical notch pathway and genes that participate in its crosstalk with the wnt and hh pathways <cit> . as shown in figure 6a, many of these genes are up-regulated in lncap and pcscs pss. additionally, reporter gene analysis using the promoter of hes <dig>  whose transcription is driven by csl, evidenced a 2-3-fold increase in reporter activity in lncap pss relative to the parental cell line . co-expression of nicd stimulates hes <dig> promoter activity in a similar magnitude thus supporting the specificity and sensitivity of the reporter assay. finally, we found that the γ-secretase inhibitor  not only inhibited the growth of lncap pss but also induced an adherent morphological phenotype . this data indicate a higher activity of the notch pathway in pss, and a role of this signaling cascade in ps growth.

discussion
the notion that progenitors as well as tics can grow in vitro as spheroids has been extensively documented for several tissues types. however, the lack of consensus culturing conditions has hampered the elucidation of the molecular pathways that sustain this phenotype. in an attempt to find a comprehensive medium suitable for the selection and propagation of prostate tics, we tested various embryonic stem cell media. we found that scm supplemented with knockout™sr  was able to select tics, sustaining the growth of pss not only from normal and cancer cell lines, but also from early passage prostate tumor cell cultures. we demonstrated that these pss have a monoclonal origin, a relevant aspect that is seldom addressed in the cancer stem cell field. the stem cell identity of these prostatospheres was supported by their extensive in vitro self-renewal potential in the "neurosphere assay", the expression of known prostate tic markers and the increased tumorigenicity compared to the parental cell line. indeed, scm-1%ko culture seems to select in favor of tics along passages, as was previously observed for normal mouse prostate progenitor cells  <cit> . it is therefore possible that this culture system provides a means for the long-term enrichment of tics.

our analysis of stem cell markers evidenced that pss preferentially express some classic embryonic stem cell  and tic  markers. the down-regulation of ar mrna in lncap is in agreement with the reported reduction in ar expression in prostate tics <cit> . our data also suggest that prominin- <dig> could be an interesting new marker for prostate cancer tics . prom <dig> is a paralogue of prom <dig> that is expressed in the prostate and co-localizes with promin <dig> in epithelial cells  <cit> . indeed, prom <dig> protein is enriched in cells located in the basal compartment of the glandular epithelium where only few cells were found to be positive for prom <dig>  <cit> . another attractive stem cell marker candidate is the hmg-box class transcription factor sox <dig>  which is expressed in embryonic and somatic progenitor cells  <cit> . moreover, sox <dig> is required for prostate development  <cit>  and its expression was found to be restricted to basal epithelium in the normal human adult  <cit> . furthermore, prostate tumors express this tf and its expression increases in relapsed hormone refractory tumors <cit> . the same report showed that sox <dig> is regulated by β-catenin and affects prostate cancer cell proliferation, angiogenesis and invasion; in particular in the lncap cell line. finally, our data also support the observation that nanog is a key regulator of prostate tics  <cit> .

in order to interpret our microarray data, we carried out several analyses. ipa highlighted cell death and cellular movement as the principal gene categories regulated in pss, which is consistent with the modulation of self-renewal and with the morphological differences between monolayer and spheroid growth. the finding of an enrichment in embryonic tfs related to myc and tcf- <dig>  which are indeed regulators of cancer stem cell pathways  <cit> , reinforces the tic identity of the pss. in fact, our group and others recently provided evidence in favor of a role for wnt signalling in prostate tics  <cit> . myod <dig> has been recently implicated in myoblast maintenance, and, in combination with tcf <dig>  it inhibits myoblast differentiation leading to rhabdomyosarcomas  <cit> . yy <dig> is a pleiotropic transcription factor expressed in prostate glandular epithelium and basal cells, and its expression is positively correlated with prostate cancer metastasis . indeed, it is well documented to be involved in specification of mesodermal lineages  <cit> . the prediction of mesenchymal transcription factor activity  could be indicative of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which has lately been related to tumor progenitor cell plasticity  <cit> . in summary, the four known tf predicted to be modulated in pcscs and lncap pss are known to be active in adult stem cells.

we also defined a set of  <dig> genes that are analogously and significantly regulated in lncap and pcscs . it includes several cell adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins, signaling molecules, transcriptional regulators and metabolic factors. the role of most of these factors in tic biology has not yet been studied. to date, three complete gene expression datasets of putative prostate tics have been published. dubrovska et. al. reported the genomic profiling of pss derived from du <dig> and pc <dig> cell lines  <cit> . strikingly,  <dig> genes of our  <dig> gene signature  overlap with their dataset. analysis of cd133+ vs. alpha2lowprostate tumor cell array data published by birnie et al. reveal a set of four genes common to our signature  <cit> . comparison of the gene expression profiles of cd133+ and cd133- cells isolated from hormone-refractory prostate cancer biopsies, published by shepherd et al.  <cit> , shows that eif2s <dig>  rad <dig>  qki, man1c <dig> and mertk are significantly regulated in the direction observed in our signature. the small overlap between the studies might be explained by the differences in the methods used for the isolation and culturing of tics.

remarkably,  <dig> of the  <dig> genes correlated to prostate cancer in our study of oncomine dataset. among them, several have already been reported to be associated with prostate cancer. neuropilin <dig>  for instance, has been proposed as a marker of aggressiveness of prostate carcinoma, as well as other tumor types  <cit> . its ability to modulate tumor cell invasion and migration represents one interesting commonality with cancer stem cells  <cit> . likewise, gdf <dig> has been associated with the progression of diseaseto metastasis  <cit>  and has also been proposed as a prostate cancer biomarker  <cit> . its capacity to inhibit proliferation is consistent with the quiescence of tics. in addition, jag <dig>  one of the ligands for the notch receptor, is proposed as a prostate cancer marker  <cit> . five other ps up-regulated genes  have been found to be overexpressed in prostate cancer and many other tumor types, but their role in tumor biology is less understood. finally, two genes are associated with non-prostatic neoplasms: elf <dig> with breast cancer  <cit>  and col6a <dig> with astrocytoma  <cit> . in addition, several of the  <dig> down-regulated genes have been previously shown to be decreased in prostate cancer. kruppel-like factor  <dig>  for example, is considered a potential tumor suppressor in prostate and breast cancer  <cit>  as well as tropomiosin <dig> in several tumors types  <cit> . of note, the tumor suppressor candidate elf <dig> facilitates entrance to the cell cycle of quiescent hematopoietic stem cells  <cit> . similarly, expression of the cell adhesion protein kal <dig> was found to be inversely correlated with metastatic capacity in prostate and other tumor types  <cit> . likewise, several studies demonstrated a significant negative correlation between expression of metallothioneins and cancer/progression in prostate tumors and cell lines  <cit> . finally, mme is contained in a potential prostate cancer susceptibility locus in prostate cancer aci rat models  <cit> . galectins  <cit> , nav <dig>  <cit>  and qki  <cit>  are also correlated to cancer types other than prostate. lastly, many genes of this  <dig> gene list have not been extensively studied yet.

contrary to the oncogenic role assigned by the literature  <cit> , our analysis in oncomine indicates that slc7a <dig> and id <dig> are negatively correlated with cancer progression. the explanation for this discrepancy is unclear. in support of our findings, id <dig> and id <dig> downregulation has been also observed in another tic profiling study  <cit> .

due to the over-expression of the jag <dig> notch <dig> receptor in pss, we addressed the involvement of notch signaling in ps growth. gene expression analysis of notch signaling cascade, reporter gene studies, and pathway inhibition experiments presented here indicate a higher activity of the notch pathway in pss as compared to the parental cell lines. in support of our hypothesis, bisson et al. recently reported that the lncap derivative, c4-2b, which displays about five times higher notch activity than original lncap cells  <cit> , expresses more stem cell markers and has higher sphere forming ability than lncap  <cit> . it is also worth mentioning that some of the genes overexpressed in pss  are thought to be regulated by notch signaling. altogether this data support the hypothesis that the notch pathway is contributing to the ps phenotype.

CONCLUSIONS
we presented the isolation and propagation of monoclonal cancer pss from several cell lines and early passaged tumor cells. in agreement with the tic identity of these pss, we demonstrated that they bear the fundamental tic traits of marker expression, self-renewal and tumorigenicity. the culture medium used in our study could provide a new means for the standardization of prostate tic cultures, and may possibly reduce the difficulties of the comparison between laboratory cell lines and patient material.

furthermore, we propose new candidate prostate tic markers  as well as potential biomarkers for prostate cancer status and progression that may be related to the tic phenotype. further studies will be needed to understand the role of each one of them. finally, we show evidence in favor of a role of the notch pathway in the maintenance of ps phenotype.
