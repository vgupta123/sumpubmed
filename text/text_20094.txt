BACKGROUND
predicting the consequences of environmental cues or genetic perturbations based on genetic network is becoming a powerful tool to understand biological phenomena or gene functions from a systems point of view. ordinary differentiation equation  can make detailed predictions on a network but its application is limited by the network size because determining the values of the kinetic parameters for a large number of odes and solving these questions are often nontrivial. recently, one exceptional study was conducted on an archaeon h. salinarum nrc- <dig>  <cit> . subsequent to genome sequencing, a large number of microarray, proteomic and chip-chip assays were carried out to reconstruct the genetic network. the great amount of data allowed training of a computational method to predict expression changes of gene modules upon perturbations. ideally, such a comprehensive and systematic approach can be applied to every organism. however, the tremendous expense and effort are often inhibitory particularly for much more complicated organisms such as human. alternatively, large-scale networks have been reconstructed from genomic and proteomic data. although relatively noisier than the genetic networks studied by ode, which are usually assembled from literature, such large-scale networks can still generate insightful predictions. for example, marcotte and colleagues have predicted the phenotypes of knocking out genes in yeast and worm using genetic networks reconstructed by integrating various sources of data  <cit> . however, these networks only represent correlation between genes but not necessarily physical interactions. predictions are made based on how tightly the gene of interest is correlated with genes annotated with desired specific phenotype. similar approaches have been applied to predicting gene functions, particularly those related to diseases and thus potential drug targets, based on networks directly reconstructed from genomic and/or proteomic data  <cit> .

in the present study, we aim to address the following issues in predicting phenotypes based on genetic network. first, can one perform de novo predictions of phenotypes without relying on existing annotations of genes? if this is feasible, it will not only help make new discoveries but also demonstrate the effectiveness of understanding biological phenomena at a systems level. second, can one predict a phenotype that is quantitatively measured using a genetic network that consists of physical interactions? a quantitative phenotype may provide a rigorous assessment of the prediction accuracy and physical-interaction network often shed light on understanding the molecular mechanism of phenotype formation. third, can genomic analysis capture the most prominent features, which may form the major regulatory interactions, of such network? is this "scaffold" of the network still able to predict the quantitative phenotypes?

we choose the sporulation process in saccharomyces cerevisiae to perform a case study. all sexually reproducing organisms undergo meiosis in which each diploid cell generates four haploid gametes. the meiotic process in budding yeast is coupled with spore morphogenesis in which spores are formed from the haploid cells. regulation of yeast sporulation has been studied for years and numerous important regulators have been identified  <cit> . genome-wide expression assays have been performed to determine the transcriptional program  <cit> . in addition, effect of single-gene deletions on sporulation efficiency has been determined at a genomic scale, which provided quantitative phenotypic measurements  <cit> .

we first collect experimental evidence from literature to construct a network that includes both protein-protein interactions and transcription factor -gene regulatory interactions. we then investigate the dynamics of the network using a boolean network model. our study demonstrates that the yeast sporulation network has a robust design and, once sporulation starts, the network topology ensures the completion of the process. we also reconstruct a transcriptional regulatory network for yeast sporulation from genomic data using a computational method called ummi . comparison between the curated and the predicted networks shows that the most important transcriptional edges of the curated network are correctly identified by ummi. when the predicted transcriptional edges are combined with necessary non-transcriptional edges taken from literature, the hybrid network shows the same dynamic characteristics and similar predictive power as the fully curated one.

RESULTS
construct yeast sporulation network from literature
we first construct a genetic network with  <dig> nodes for yeast sporulation from the literature  <cit> . this curated network includes the known major regulators for the yeast sporulation such as ume <dig>  ime <dig>  sum <dig> and ndt <dig> . completion of the sporulation process requires sequential activation of the early meiotic genes  and the middle meiotic genes , which are represented by two marker nodes in fig.  <dig>  we use and nodes to represent the formation of protein complexes . the camp/pka signaling pathway plays an important role in yeast cells to prevent sporulation under growth condition  <cit> . it suppresses the activity of several major sporulation activators such as rim <dig> and msn <dig>  therefore, we introduce a single suppressor node to represent this pathway.

the upper half of fig.  <dig> shows that many protein-protein interactions are involved in regulating a master meiotic regulator - ime <dig>  after ime <dig> is activated, it turns on the downstream sporulation activators such as ime <dig> and ndt <dig> to transcribe emg and mmg . after both emg and mmg are transcribed, the yeast cell is committed to complete the sporulation process  <cit> .

predict the yeast sporulation efficiency
a genome-wide study was performed previously to quantitatively determine the effect of deleting a single gene on the efficiency of yeast sporulation  <cit> . a prespo/spore ratio, measured by microarray, represents the percentage of a single deletion strain that can complete sporulation. if the ratio is larger than one, the deleted gene is considered as sporulation deficient; otherwise, sporulation efficient.

we choose boolean network to analyze the curated network and search for the fixed points . we follow the previous work of  <cit>  in updating the network state  using a markov chain . the only modification to the previous method is the inclusion of a logical and function to mimic the effect of an and node. we also define a product function to quantify the sporulation percentage using the two markers' states: when emg and mmg are both in state "1", sporulation is complete; otherwise, sporulation is incomplete. perturbations to the network can be performed by clamping a node to state "0", for deleting a gene, or removing an edge, for disrupting an interaction. to have a direct comparison with the measured prespo/spore ratio, we calculate the ratio of sporulation percentage before perturbation versus that after perturbation, denoted by a symbol a . this is done by enumerating all possible initializations of boolean networks with and without clamping the deleted gene to state "0". in the same way, we have also evaluated the effect of other types of perturbations to the network, such as deleting an edge or deleting multiple genes .

we observe that the sporulation percentage for the curated network is  <dig>  . all individual nodes in fig.  <dig> are then systematically deleted  except and gate, pathway, emg and mmg nodes that do not represent specific genes in the microarray experiments  <cit> . for the  <dig> genes deleted in the curated network , satisfactory correlation between the measured and predicted sporulation efficiency are observed . the pearson correlation is  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and the spearman rank correlation is  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  there are three outliers in fig. 2: rim <dig>  rim <dig> and ndt <dig>  rim <dig> is required for high-level gene expression in the early stage of meiosis, premeiotic dna replication, timely and efficient commitment to meiotic recombination, nuclear division, and spore formation. rim <dig> is a protein kinase required for the interaction between ime <dig> and ume <dig>  and subsequently the expression of emg and spore formation. rim <dig> is also required to relieve the repression of ime <dig>  however, the exact mechanisms of rim <dig> and rim <dig> to promote sporulation are still unknown. it is most likely that there are regulatory partners of rim <dig> and rim <dig> missed in the curated network. also, the simple boolean network may not be able to capture sophisticated regulatory interactions, such as the competitive regulation between ndt <dig> and sum <dig>  <cit> . nevertheless, the high spearman rank correlation shows that our model correctly captures the relative effect of single gene deletions. the third outlier ndt <dig> is a very important meiotic regulator and its deletion is highly sporulation deficient . our prediction  corresponds very well with the experimental result. we consider it as an outlier to avoid the correlation result biased by a single data point. if the three outliers are removed, the pearson correlation becomes  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig> and the spearman rank correlation becomes  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  × 10- <dig>  which are satisfactory considering the difficulty of de novo prediction on quantitative phenotypes.

to further illustrate obtaining such a correlation is nontrivial, we perform a negative control experiment by looking at the correlation between the "absolute" sporulation efficiency change caused by deleting a gene and the averaged or minimal shortest path from each gene to emg and mmg. to calculate the "absolute" sporualtion efficiency change, prespo/spore ratios smaller than  <dig>  are inversed. a negative correlation is thus expected because the shorter a gene's path to the markers, the larger its influence. if the averaged path is used, we have a pearson correlation of - <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  and a spearman rank correlation of - <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig> . if the minimal path is used, a pearson correlation of - <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  and a spearman rank correlation of - <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig>  are obtained. both the correlation and the statistical significance are significantly lower than boolean network predictions.

robustness and hysteresis of the sporulation network
the satisfactory performance of the curated network in predicting sporulation efficiency for single-gene deletions suggests that this network captures the major regulatory interactions of yeast sporulation. we thus further analyze this network  to investigate how robust the yeast sporulation process is. once ime <dig> is activated, the cell is considered to commit to meiosis. the three key regulators  have multiple positive feedbacks to sustain their active status . therefore, we first examine which of these feedbacks are important for sporulation completion. we disrupt each feedback loop by removing the edge in the boolean network and re-calculate the sporulation percentage by enumerating all possible initializations . none of the perturbations causes significant change in sporulation percentage except ime2--|sum <dig> , which confirms the importance of relieving the repression of sum <dig> on ndt <dig>  we then perform a systematic study by knocking out every edge in the curated network and analyze their effects on sporulation efficiency . for those edges whose deletions are sporulation deficient, only ndt80-> mmg  and ime1--| rpd <dig>   have high and intermediate impact on sporulation, respectively. the former is obvious because ndt <dig> is a key activator for mmg while the latter shows the importance for ime <dig> to repress an emg repressor, rpd <dig>  the other  <dig> edges only affect sporulation efficiency slightly . the deletion of the rest  <dig> edges is sporulation efficient but only five of them have relatively significant effect . notably, four of them are related to an emg repressor, rpd3; rpd3--|rim <dig> ; rpd3--|emg ; tup1-> rpd <dig>  and tup1-> tup <dig> . tup <dig> is also a repressor for ime <dig>  the fifth sporulation efficient edge is camp/pka--|msn <dig> which belongs to the camp/pka pathway. all of these sporulation efficient edges are related to pre-meiotic repression of emg and ime <dig>  which is important to prevent sporulation under the growth condition. our analysis suggests that the sporulation network is overall robust, which guarantees the completion of sporulation once the cell is committed to it.

* "-> " means the left node activates the right node and "--|" means the left node represses the right node. "p" and "n" represent that the functions of the feedback loops are positive and negative regulation, respectively.

*a represents the effect of disrupting the edge to the completion of sporulation .

in addition to positive feedbacks, there are two negative feedback loops for ime <dig> . such architecture determines that ime <dig> forms a hysteretic switch of sporulation: ime <dig> is absolutely needed to initiate the meiotic process; however, ime <dig> becomes unneeded after the cell commits to sporulation. indeed, it is known to be important for the yeast cell to inactivate ime <dig> once the sporulation-specific genes have been transcribed  <cit> . consistently, we observe that ime <dig> is in the final state "1" in only 44% of all possible initializations that lead to sporulation in the curated network, indicating the importance of the negative feedbacks. to further confirm this, we perturb the two negative feedback loops  by deleting the repression edges to ime <dig>  removing either cln2/cdc28--|ime <dig> or ime2/rim4--|ime <dig> raises the percentage to 61% in both cases. removing both edges raises the percentage to 70%.

predictions of other perturbations' effects on sporulation
to identify synergetic genetic interactions between genes, we perform double deletion experiments in the curated network to identify gene pairs that are either sporulation deficient or efficient. from the histogram of the  <dig> double deletion tests , four groups of gene pairs emerge: sporulation efficient ; sporulation neutral ; middle sporulation deficient  and high sporulation deficient . these thresholds are consistent with the prespo/spore ratios used in  <cit>  to define sporulation-deficient and -efficient genes. the full list of gene pairs and deletion results are shown in additional file  <dig>  table s9). the most sporulation deficient gene pair is ndt80-ime <dig>  compared to a =  <dig>  and a =  <dig>  for ndt <dig> and ime <dig> single deletions, respectively . this is not surprising because they are master regulators for early and middle meiotic genes. the most sporulation efficient gene pair is rpd3-sum <dig>  . histone deacetylase rpd <dig> is an early meiotic repressor  <cit> . seventeen gene pairs associated with rpd <dig> are sporulation efficient . however, association with other regulators may alleviate the effect of rpd <dig> deletion, e.g. rpd3-ime <dig>  and rpd3-ndt <dig>  . together with the feedback loop deletion analysis, our study manifests the importance of rpd <dig> in regulating sporulation progression and completion.

we also find that the self-activation of the meiotic activators has minor impact on sporulation efficiency . even when the self-activation of all five activators is disrupted, the effect is slightly sporulation deficient . however, the pka pathway plays an important role in suppressing sporulation as deletion of camp/pka node is sporulation efficient . this is consistent with the known role of this pathway in the literature  <cit> . all these computational predictions are novel and can guide the future experimental investigations of the sporulation mechanisms.

uncover transcriptional regulatory interactions of sporulation by a computational method
we finally exploit a computational approach, ummi, for de novo discovery of the transcriptional regulatory interactions during the sporulation. ummi is an extension to our previous method, gbnet  <cit> , which aims to find sequence constraints, such as co-occurrence of two motifs and distance constraint between them, enriched in a group of co-regulated genes. based on the rules identified, target genes of a tf can be inferred. unlike gbnet that relies on gene clusters generated from multiple microarray experiments, ummi can be applicable to a single gene expression experiment. in addition, we also develop a measurement in ummi to control the reliability of the models discovered . the gene expression data from chu et al.  <cit>  is used in our analysis, which covers seven time points of sporulation: metabolic , early i , early ii , early-mid , middle , mid-late  and late .

we have compiled a list of  <dig> dna motifs in yeast, including known motifs taken from literature and computationally generated ones . at each time point, all the genes are divided into  <dig> groups based on their expression levels . ummi is then used to find the combination of motifs and sequence constraints between these motifs that are associated with gene expression levels. ummi finds several highly reliable constraints at each time point  that pass a reliability threshold  of  <dig> . based on these sequence constraints, we have recovered the known key transcription factors  in sporulation: ume <dig>  ndt <dig> and sum <dig>  furthermore, we identify  <dig> ume6's target genes that satisfy the ume6's sequence constraints and show at least 2-fold over-expression at early stages of sporulation . the functions of these genes indicate that they play important roles in sporulation. for example, the top three enriched gene ontology  terms of biological process are: m phase of meiotic cell cycle , meiosis i  and reciprocal meiotic recombination  . we also identify  <dig> and  <dig> target genes whose expression levels have at least 2-fold elevation at middle stages  and satisfy the sequence constraints for ndt <dig> and sum <dig>  respectively. the top three enriched go terms of biological process are: spore wall assembly , sporulation  and ascospore formation   . ndt <dig> and sum <dig> share  <dig> common targets whose top three enriched go terms for biological process are strongly associated with sporulation: spore wall assembly , sporulation  and ascospore formation  .

we compare the target genes of the three regulators to the known regulators of sporulation  <cit>  and, based on the overlapped targets , we reconstruct a sporulation network of the core transcriptional regulations with minimal protein-protein interactions  added from literature . the added ppi are: a complex formation between ume <dig> and ime1; ime2's repression on ime <dig> and sum <dig> by phosphorylation; ime2's activating ndt <dig>  these ppis are essential to sporulation but cannot be detected by gene expression microarray experiments. they are thus added to complete the network in fig.  <dig>  we also add an ume6/ime <dig> node to represent the protein complex formed by ume <dig> and ime <dig>  we denote the ume6's target genes as "emg", and ndt <dig> and sum1's target genes as "mmg". fig.  <dig> illustrates a scaffold of the genetic network of the yeast sporulation. it is no doubt many regulatory interactions are not included in this predicted network. however, the significant overlap between the curated and the predicted networks  suggests that ummi uncovers the most prominent features of a transcriptional network, which may constitute the scaffold of the genetic network regulating sporulation.

interestingly, the predicted network is able to achieve comparable accuracy on sporulation efficiency prediction as the curated network . the pearson correlation between the computational prediction and the experimental measurement is  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig> e- <dig> and the spearman rank correlation is  <dig>  with a p-value of  <dig> . it should be noted that the dataset used to calculate the correlations for the predicted network is very small  and therefore the p-values are not highly significant. nevertheless, these encouraging results suggest that the most prominent transcriptional regulatory interactions captured by genomic data can be recovered by computational methods combined with literature curation and such a hybrid network still has a satisfactory predictive power of phenotypes.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
accurately predicting phenotypes based on genetic network that constitutes physical interactions can provide great mechanistic insight into phenotype formation. we have conducted a case study in yeast sporulation by predicting a quantitative phenotype, sporulation efficiency change after deleting a gene, based on a network assembled from the existing knowledge. such a physical interaction network illustrates how the perturbations are propagated in the network to cause phenotype formation. importantly, our predictions are de novo and only rely on network topology. this study is the first to reveal the direct relationship between network topology and phenotype formation.

it is no doubt that there are genes and/or links missing in the reconstructed network which is still small. however, the satisfactory prediction accuracy suggests that the major regulatory interactions have been uncovered. we have also demonstrated that computational methods can extract the most prominent features of the transcriptional regulation captured by genomic data. with a minimal set of protein-protein interactions added, such a scaffold network shows promising predictive power. such a network can still be noisy but may contain the key regulatory interactions that are important to correctly predict phenotypes to a satisfactory extent.

we choose boolean network to analyze the dynamics and robustness of the yeast sporulation network. compared with the differential equation approach, boolean network does not provide the detailed temporal change of each gene/protein or cooperation between genes such as the competitive binding of ndt <dig> and sum <dig>  <cit> . on the other hand, it allows study of the network in fig.  <dig> with  <dig> nodes, which is often difficult to determine all the kinetic parameters needed in differential equations and even more challenging to solve them. encouragingly, such a simple and easy to implement model can make de novo predictions of phenotypes accurately. it would be interesting to explore the power of this model on much larger networks with hundreds or even thousands of nodes once the data for reconstructing the networks become available.

in this work, we predict the phenotype based on enumerating all possible initializations. the computational cost for such an approach is exponential in scale. for example, the computational time for a boolean network with  <dig> nodes is  <dig> hours. it will be  <dig> days for a boolean network with  <dig> nodes, and  <dig> years for  <dig> nodes. instead of enumerating all possible initializations, we have tried to sample only a small number of the initializations at random. we find such a sampling approach can make predictions with high precisions . other researchers have made similar observations about boolean networks: given the number of nodes and the node connectivity, randomly sampled boolean networks have similar global properties  <cit> . we thus argue that the random sampling technique may allow extension of our approach to a much larger network in the future.
