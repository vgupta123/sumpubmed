BACKGROUND
targeted gene repair is a process that corrects single base mutations in genes within the chromosome. nucleotide alteration is directed by a short single-stranded oligonucleotide, which also serves as a template for the base exchange reaction. the mechanism of action continues to be unraveled but the general system involves a dna pairing step in which the oligonucleotide aligns to the homologous target site and a correction step in which the genetic information in the oligonucleotide is transferred to the target gene  <cit> . the reaction is catalyzed by enzymes involved in homologous recombination and may be influenced by proteins that regulate the cellular response to dna damage  <cit> . damage occurs naturally in mammalian genomes by the action of oxygen radicals, mistakes in dna synthesis and from exogenous sources such as chemicals or irradiation.

chemotherapeutic drugs such as vp <dig> or camptothecin  or reagents such as hydroxyurea, thymidine, or methyl methanesulfonate  that cause lesions to accumulate at replication forks  <cit>  can be used to induce dna damage in experimental systems and facilitate studies of gene repair. these lesions inhibit fork movement, leading to a stall in s phase, an event that stimulates gene repair activity. in a recent study, hu et al.  <cit>  found that the synchronization of cells at the g1/s border with subsequent release enables a higher level of gene repair. the correction levels peak when the majority of cells are in s phase, results which align with earlier data of majumdar et al.  <cit> . in addition, brachman and kmiec  <cit>  demonstrated that dna replication can influence both the rate and frequency of gene repair. by slowing fork movement, these workers were able to elevate the frequency by activating the homologous recombination  pathway and enabling the correction process to occur with greater efficiency. these data are consistent with earlier reports that had already pointed to hr as a regulatory process of gene repair  <cit> . the induction of hr pathways by dna damage and the subsequent stimulation of gene repair has provided further clarification of the proteins and pathways involved in the correction events. while earlier findings support a role for dna damage-induced responses in elevating the frequency of gene repair, little is known about the mechanism of correction i.e. the details of nucleotide exchange. what is known is that regulatory proteins activated by dna damage events stimulate a cellular response that leads directly or indirectly to a high efficiency of gene repair activity.

the p <dig> tumor suppressor regulates cell cycle checkpoints, apoptosis, and can transactivate a number of genes involved dna repair. furthermore, p <dig> can act to suppress hr; it is recruited to stalled replication forks to slow or prevent uncontrolled homologous exchanges  <cit> . when p <dig> was overexpressed in dld- <dig> cells simultaneous with the initiation of oligonucleotide-directed gene repair, p <dig> acts as an antagonist of the reaction, reducing the level of egfp positive, corrected cells significantly  <cit> . this suppressive activity could result from p53's role in cell cycle control, dna damage response, or regulation of senescence and apoptosis. as a long term goal, we seek to modulate and harness the hr repair response as it relates to gene repair activity without inducing the natural suppression associated with the induction of dna damage.

the amino acid selenomethionine, the major component of se-enriched foods, has long been demonstrated as a chemopreventative agent, and selenium compounds have yielded encouraging results in current clinical trials to prevent prostate, colon, and other human cancers. selenomethionine has been reported to induce a dna repair response and enhance repair-complex formation in treated cells by means of a modulation of p <dig> activity  <cit> . the tumor-suppressor function of p <dig> is usually attributed to its activity at a post-damage stage when it eliminates cells with damaged dna resulting from genotoxic stress. selenomethionine seems to induce a different branch of p <dig> activity, converting p <dig> into a new conformation through a reduction reaction catalyzed by the protein ref- <dig>  in this form, p <dig> does not have any growth-suppressing effect but can effectively modulate dna repair. thus, p <dig> facilitates control over genomic stability by a mechanism that does not require cell death or arrest  <cit> . an agent that modulates gene repair without exhibiting toxicity or inducing dna damage has numerous advantages, particularly in cases where the level of repair falls below that of clinical relevance and an adjuvant treatment will be required.

ref- <dig> is important for the redox regulation of p <dig>  but it is also involved in a number of critical cellular pathways. ref- <dig> associates with the human ape <dig> protein, forming the multifunctional human ap endonuclease . ape1-ref- <dig> functions as an ap endonuclease in dna repair, and it can activate numerous transcription factors through redox-dependent and redox independent mechanisms  <cit> . ref- <dig> exerts redox control of p <dig> protein by reducing adjacent cysteine residues , breaking the disulfide bond and rendering a new p <dig> conformation. this conformation is associated with increased activation of dna repair proteins, thus requiring less action for cell cycle arrest or apoptosis.

as described above, selenomethionine has been reported to induce a dna repair response and enhance repair-complex formation in treated cells. we have reported how to create such a response by inducing a tolerable level of dna damage that elevates gene repair activity  <cit> . in order to advance the technology of gene repair in disease models it is necessary to develop safe and simple methods to increase the efficiency of this repair. selenium compounds clearly influence dna damage response pathways  <cit>  often modulating the levels of enzymes known to be involved in gene repair. it should be noted that these authors focused on nucleotide excision repair, a process unrelated to homologous recombination. in any event, we examined the effect of selenium on gene repair activity in a mammalian model cell system in order to gain a greater perspective on the degree of cellular response to the activation of repair pathways.

RESULTS
the assay system
a standard assay system based on the correction of an integrated mutant egfp gene was employed to measure gene repair activity. a single clonal isolate from hct  <dig> cells  containing a single copy of the mutant egfp gene  was used for these experiments. a low-copy target gene is advantageous in a model system for oligonucleotide-directed gene repair, conferring only a single site for gene repair activity per cell. specific oligonucleotides were designed to correct the ta g point mutation at amino acid position  <dig> which lies in the chromophore region of the egfp gene and conversion to ta c enables expression of wild-type egfp, allowing detection of positive conversion events by facs analysis  <cit>  . the standard vector, egfp3s/47nt, is a 47-mer containing three phosphorothioates at each termini to protect against nuclease activity. this system is well established and has been used in multiple studies to validate gene repair activity  <cit> .

selenomethionine does not induce cell toxicity
we examined cellular toxicity and genotoxicity of selenium in the hct  <dig> model system. in general, organic selenium compounds have been found to exhibit low levels of toxicity in most cells. in our hands, selenomethionine was found to be nontoxic in hct  <dig> cells, as measured by an mtt reduction assay for viability with concentrations up to  <dig> mm . these results set the viability parameters and indicate that a  <dig> h pretreatment with 50– <dig> μm selenomethionine, the experimental conditions used traditionally to assess the modulation of gene repair activity, does not lead to significant cell death.

selenomethionine does not induce double-stranded breaks in dna
at the genomic level, no significant dna breakage in hct  <dig> cells is observed by the addition of selenomethionine as evidenced by the pulse field gel  presented in figure 1c. genomic dna isolated from selenomethionine-treated cells at concentrations of  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> μm respectively does not exhibit greater fragmentation compared to an untreated population of cells. this is in sharp contrast to the positive control in which the cells were treated with methyl methanesulfonate   <cit> . in this case, significant fragmentation is observed, evidenced by the bright smear of dna containing an extensive number of breaks running into the gel. the bright band near the top of the damaged dna region represents genomic dna containing only a few strand breaks. thus, selenomethionine treatment does not result in extensive dna damage and therefore does not induce a cellular dna repair response similar to that seen when etoposide  or camptothecin is added to a cell culture  <cit> .

gene repair activity modulated by selenomethionine
recently, we reported that inducing a low level of dna damage in cells significantly elevates the level of gene repair activity  <cit> ; the introduction of double strand breaks in the target cell led to a cell cycle arrest in response to the creation and/or presence of the dna damage. during the arrested phase of the reaction, the oligonucleotide is able to more accurately and efficiently gain access to the target site on the dna, presumably because the cells undergoing gene repair are contained within the population suspended in s phase . one response to dna damage is the elevation of activities which have been shown previously to regulate the gene repair reaction. thus, agents that increase repair activity are obvious candidates for stimulatory factors of correction, and particularly those that stimulate the repair pathways without causing dna damage. along these lines, selenomethionine has been shown to induce dna repair processes by stabilizing the formation of repair complexes  <cit> . thus, we tested for modulation of gene repair by pre-treating the cells with varying doses of selenomethionine. the cells were treated for twenty-four hours, followed first by a wash-out and electroporation of the oligonucleotide, egfp3s/47nt. gene repair was evaluated by facs twenty-four hours later, and the data reveal that correction levels decrease as a function of dose of selenomethionine  . these are the same concentrations  that exhibit no significant cytotoxicity .

the effect of selenomethionine treatment on cell cycle progression
as mentioned above, some treatments that increase the efficiency of gene correction do so by inducing dna damage and cell cycle arrest  <cit> . other treatments induce s phase accumulation but without dna damage and still support high levels of gene repair  <cit> . since selenomethionine has not been reported to damage dna directly and we observed no ds breaks , we examined the effect of selenomethionine pretreatment on cell cycle progression. as shown in figure 2b, cells treated with selenomethionine for  <dig> hrs exhibit a different cell cycle profile compared to untreated cells. facs analysis reveals that while the overall percentage of cells in s phase is the same for non-treated and selenomethionine-treated cells, selenomethionine-treated cells exhibit some accumulation in g <dig> with a compensatory reduction in the population of cells in g <dig> or at the g1/s border. this result is similar to a cell cycle block caused by oxidative damage, where the passage from g <dig> to mitosis is delayed  <cit> . thus, selenomethionine does not arrest or delay cells in s phase, a condition that has been shown to stimulate gene repair activity. interestingly, the effect on cell cycle is reversible, as the cell cycle profile of treated cells returns to normal  <dig> hours after the removal of selenomethionine from the culture .

selenomethionine does not lead to increased expression or activation of p <dig> but does increase ref- <dig> levels
as shown in figure 2a, selenium reduces gene repair activity. one may therefore predict that this reduction is transmitted through a ref-1-mediated redox activation of wild-type p <dig>  <cit> , which has been shown to suppress gene repair activity  <cit> . as such, selenomethionine treatment should not increase the overall expression of p <dig> in hct <dig> cells, nor should it induce the activation of p <dig> through phosphorylation. we tested this prediction by western blot analysis of proteins isolated from hct <dig> cells treated with selenomethionine  for  <dig> hours . an immunoblot with the p53-do antibody, which is specific for total wild-type and mutant p <dig>  exhibited no distinguishable change in p <dig> expression in non-treated or selenomethionine-treated cells. likewise, immunoblotting with an antibody specific to an activated form of p <dig>   <cit> , which occurs in response to dna damage showed no detectable activated p <dig> in the non-treated and selenomethionine-treated cells.

whereas p <dig> levels are unchanged in the presence of selenomethionine, the ref- <dig> protein is present at higher levels in hct <dig> after  <dig> hrs treatment with selenomethionine , as determined by immunoblot specific to ref- <dig> . this supports our hypothesis that selenomethionine may reduce gene repair activity through p <dig> modification that is mediated by the ref- <dig> protein.

effect of p <dig> overexpression  in human cell lines
wild-type or mutant p <dig> overexpression plasmids were introduced to cells in the presence of selenomethionine with simultaneous introduction of the targeting oligonucleotide.  <dig> μg of respective p <dig> overexpression plasmid and egfp3s/47nt oligonucleotide were electroporated and evaluated by facs after  <dig> hours. as displayed in figure 4a, cells transfected with the pcdna empty plasmid and selenomethionine exhibit a reduction in gene repair activity. this result is equivalent to suppression of gene repair activity found in cells transfected with the p <dig> plasmid, which overexpresses wild-type p <dig>  in combination, selenomethionine treatment in the presence of overexpressed p <dig> exacerbates this effect further, resulting in a nearly undetectable level of correction. thus, selenomethionine-dependent redox control of endogenous p <dig> appears to act synergistically with elevated levels of p <dig> in the suppression of gene repair.

to explore the role of p <dig> in this reaction, we utilized a separate cell line that has been used previously as an assay system for gene repair activity. this cell line, dld- <dig>  <cit>  contains the same mutated egfp gene as the hct <dig> line used above in low copy number. using a cell line with a low copy number of integrated targets is important in studies related to gene repair. in addition, this line does not have a full complement of p <dig> . using the same reaction protocol as carried out for experiments in hct <dig> cells, the integrated dld- <dig> cell line was electroporated with egfp3s/47nt and the appearance of corrected cells viewed  <dig> hours later. some samples were pre-incubated with the indicated concentration of selenomethionine for  <dig> hours prior to electroporation. as shown in figure 4b, selenomethionine does not induce an inhibition of gene repair; in fact a slight but reproducible stimulation is seen in a dose-dependent fashion. thus, a cell line devoid of the full complement of wild-type p <dig> responds differently to treatment with selenomethionine than does a cell line containing wild-type p <dig> 

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
the product of the tumor suppressor gene, p <dig>  down-regulates the process of homologous recombination  <cit> . the protein may act upon enzymes involved in the dna damage response pathway or act directly at crossover junctions, effectively stalling their development. since the process of gene repair requires the activity of proteins involved in hr, we might predict that events that induce hr suppression would likewise result in a reduction in the frequency of gene repair. previous work in our laboratory  <cit>  and others demonstrated that wild-type p <dig> can act as an antagonist of the gene repair reaction, whereas overexpression of some mutant p <dig> proteins exhibit a small yet significant elevation in the frequency of gene repair  <cit> . the suppressive action of wild-type p <dig>  <cit>  may affect the gene repair reaction through the binding to replication forks which have been shown to be a key intermediate  in the correction process  <cit> .

we observe that the overexpression of wild-type p <dig> gene in hct <dig> leads to a reduction in gene repair, confirming data from pierce et al.  <cit>  and brachman et al.  <cit> . the study by pierce et al. utilized cell-free extracts as sources of gene repair activity while brachman and kmiec tested p <dig> overexpression directly in cells  <cit> . the inhibitory effect of p <dig> in dld- <dig> cells which contain both mutant and wild-type alleles was clearly evident. mutations in the dna binding domain of the p <dig> gene can cause the p <dig> protein to lose the ability to suppress homologous recombination  <cit> . mutant forms of p <dig> may not be able to inhibit rad51-mediated strand exchange or the reverse branch migration of stalled replication forks  <cit> . expression of several mutant p <dig> proteins, specifically, the p <dig> 175h mutant, which inhibits g <dig> checkpoint control, can prevent the suppression of hr and stimulate replication inhibition-induced hr  <cit> . here, we utilize hct <dig> cells that have a normal genetic complement of wild-type p <dig> genes and show that additional p <dig> suppresses the frequency of gene repair even further.

our data suggest that suppression of gene repair activity most likely does not occur through an elevation in p <dig> expression nor by the activation of a well-known p <dig> conformer. thus, we explored a novel explanation for the suppressive nature of selenomethionine in the gene repair reaction  <cit> , showing that the addition of selenomethionine  to hct <dig> cells leads to a reduction in gene repair activity. selenium compounds have been shown to elevate p <dig> activity  <cit>  and to stimulate dna damage response pathways through a phosphorylation cascade that includes atm and h2ax  <cit> . gene repair activity has been shown to be sensitive to the activities of proteins involved in the response to dna damage  <cit> . thus, it was of interest to determine which selenium-induced pathway would predominate in this system; would increased dna repair activities promote correction or would induction of p <dig> lead to suppression. we observed that gene repair is possibly inhibited by a pathway involving p <dig>  this pathway includes ref- <dig> which controls the activity of p <dig> through redox activation  <cit> . ref- <dig> is also a key protein in the activation of other proteins including transcription factors and enzymes involved in nucleotide excision repair  <cit> . while the downstream effects of ref- <dig> induction are numerous, we focused on the activation of the ref- <dig> protein by semet. we show that under conditions that promote gene repair, semet induces ref- <dig> expression with a concurrent diminution of correction. the reduction by semet aligns with the effect of p <dig> overexpression  and the two appear to act synergistically. taken together, these data suggest that inhibition of gene repair by semet most likely takes place in a pathway involving ref- <dig>  the most likely downstream target for ref- <dig>  especially in response to dna damage is p <dig>  thus, consistent with the previous reports, we believe that p <dig> plays a critical, if not suppressive role, in regulating the frequency of gene repair.

our data are consistent with a role for homologous recombination in the mechanism of gene repair  <cit> . a number of key proteins are involved in modulating the frequency of correction. these include rad <dig>  rad <dig> and rad <dig>  <cit>  as well as atm, chk <dig> and chk <dig>  <cit> . based on the data presented herein, we can conclusively add p <dig> to that list. this protein can inhibit homologous recombination functions by binding to the three-stranded recombination intermediate and destabilizing it  <cit> . as shown by drury et al.  <cit> , the three-stranded intermediate is a requisite structure in the gene repair pathway and thus one can envision that p <dig> suppression activity occurs through the destabilization of structural intermediates. alternatively, the activation of p <dig> by selenomethionine, mediated by ref- <dig>  could inhibit the progression of replication forks, by enabling fork regression  <cit> . this reversal reduces the number of targets for gene repair because correction events rely heavily on the process of dna replication  <cit> . thus, induction of p <dig> activity will remain a barrier to the successful application of gene repair as therapy for genetic disorders.
