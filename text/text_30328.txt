BACKGROUND
chronic inflammation is an important patho-physiological condition impacting various diseases including rheumatoid arthritis , atherosclerosis, diabetes, and cancer. recent evidence suggests the involvement of toll-like receptors  in various chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  <cit> . tlrs belong to the family of pathogen-associated molecular pattern recognition receptors and are vital components of the host's immune system for sensing dangerous pathogens, and for initiating inflammatory and immune responses directed against these pathogens. the mechanism of signal transduction through tlrs is well characterized  <cit> . there are two possible routes for mediation of signals received by tlrs depending on which of the two adapter molecules  are involved. the importance of myd <dig> and trif lies in the finding that each leads to a distinct profile of immune mediators that in turn determine the phenotype of the cells that are primarily responsible for the development of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . tlr <dig> mediates through both the myd <dig> and trif pathways, tlr <dig> signals through trif and all the other tlrs mediate through myd <dig> pathway  <cit> . characterization of cellular responses to various ligands that selectively activate specific tlrs is not only useful in better understanding of disease pathogenesis but can also potentially help identify molecular targets by which pharmacological compounds modulate tlr-mediated signaling pathways and target gene expression.

triptolide is a biologically active diterpene triepoxide from a chinese herb tripterygium wilfordii hook f, commonly known as thunder god vine. extracts from this plant have been historically used in traditional chinese medicine to treat inflammatory and autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus, psoriatic arthritis and behcet's disease  <cit> . triptolide inhibited the expression of proinflammatory markers including cox- <dig> and inos in raw macrophage  <cit> . triptolide suppressed c-jun nh2-terminal kinase  phosphorylation, cox- <dig> expression and pge <dig> production in microglial cultures treated with lipopolysaccharide  <cit> . nfκb activation due to inflammatory response in chronic diseases is well characterized  <cit> . existing reports demonstrate the effect of triptolide on nfκb activation and target gene expression as well as its effect on other transcription factors  <cit> . although tlrs are known to impact downstream nfκb activation  <cit> , effects of triptolide in tlr signaling have not been evaluated. in this study we investigated the effects of triptolide activity on receptors and target gene expression induced by activation of tlrs.

RESULTS
gene array data confirmed known and revealed unknown genes affected by triptolide
expression of one hundred and ninety five target genes in response to triptolide treatment were studied by gene array in lps stimulated mouse macrophages. the genes based on their response to lps stimulation were characterized as lps-responsive  and lps-nonresponsive genes . among lps-responsive genes,  <dig> genes were downregulated  and  <dig> genes  were upregulated by triptolide treatment. fourteen genes were found to be non-responsive to lps induction . of these non-responsive genes,  <dig> genes were downregulated  and  <dig> genes were upregulated by triptolide treatment . huang et al.  reported that  <dig> genes were upregulated in raw  <dig>  cells in response to lps treatment but only  <dig>  genes were downregulated by triptolide  <cit> . in our study that included some overlapping genes with huang et al   <cit> , triptolide down regulated 21% of the lps-induced genes and affected a total of  <dig> % of lps-responsive genes  in raw macrophages. triptolide treatment was found to downregulate the expression of tlrs  <dig> and  <dig> , tlrs  <dig> and  <dig> , tnf, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  nfκb <dig>  mapk, rel, bcl <dig>  cox- <dig>  and other important inflammation regulating genes . the gene array results obtained for cox- <dig>  tnfα, il1β  and tlr <dig> were further validated using qrt-pcr. we further investigated expression of tlr-mediated genes to understand in greater details the extent of involvement of tlr signaling cascade in the activity of triptolide.

effect of triptolide on downstream effector expression induced by tlr ligands
there are three possible routes through which tlr signaling is mediated  <cit> . these routes either involve the adapter molecule myd <dig>  trif or both. tlr <dig> signals through trif and all other tlrs mediate through myd <dig> pathway whereas tlr <dig> utilizes both myd <dig> and trif to transduce the signal it receives  <cit> . one of the important readouts of tlr ligand induction is a robust pro-inflammatory response such as an upregulated expression/secretion of chemokines and cytokines. using this modulation of chemokines/cytokine expression during different ligand induction the response to triptolide treatment was evaluated. triptolide inhibited the expression of cox- <dig> and inos induced by myd88- specific ligand - zymosan , trif- specific ligand, poly i:c  and lps  which activates both myd <dig> and trif pathways . downregulation of cox- <dig> and inos by triptolide  <cit>  along with selected cytokines/chemokines that are specific to each route of tlr signaling have been used to validate downstream effects of triptolide along the tlr pathway. cox- <dig> and inos expression is common to both myd88-dependent and -independent  signaling pathways. the expression of ccl <dig> is specific for myd88-dependent pathway and expression of irg- <dig> is a specific readout of the trif-dependent pathway  <cit> . triptolide inhibited the expression of ccl <dig> in macrophage induced with zymosan  and lps  . triptolide also inhibited the expression of irg- <dig> in macrophages induced with poly i:c  and lps . these results demonstrate that triptolide inhibits the activation of chemokines involved in both myd <dig> and trif dependent pathways.

effect of triptolide on myd88ko and trifko in raw cells induced with lps
to further validate the effect of triptolide on inflammatory pathways of myd <dig> and trif, we evaluated the effect of triptolide on lps induced macrophage under the two following scenarios:  myd <dig> mediated pathway in the absence of trif regulation and  trif mediated pathway in the absence of myd <dig> regulation. as both myd <dig> and trif signaling pathways lead to nfκb activation  <cit> , we determined the activity of triptolide on nfκb translocation to the nucleus . also, because cox- <dig> and inos are downstream target genes regulated by nfκb, their increased expression is an indirect indicator of nfκb activation. to further validate results of figure  <dig>  whether or not triptolide modulates both myd <dig> and trif mediated signaling pathways, the activation of nfκb and the expression of cox- <dig> and inos induced by lps in myd88-ko macrophages and trif-ko macrophages were determined. triptolide suppressed lps-induced nfκb translocation in a dose dependent manner as determined by immunoblotting of the p <dig> protein in nuclear extracts. we observed that the incubation of myd88-ko and trif-ko macrophages with lps  produced an increase in nfκb translocation  to the nuclear compartment that was evident at  <dig> mins of incubation time. figure 2a, 2b and 2c show that this translocation process was inhibited in myd88-ko, trif-ko and wild-type macrophages by pretreatment with triptolide in a dose dependent manner. similarly, triptolide inhibited the gene expression of cox- <dig> and inos induced by lps in myd88-ko, trif-ko and wild-type macrophages in a dose dependent manner . together, these results demonstrate that triptolide suppresses both myd <dig> and trif -dependent signaling pathways.

effect of triptolide activity on protein and mrna expression of adaptor molecules and tlr
triptolide was found to suppress both myd <dig> and trif-dependent signaling pathways activated by lps agonization of tlr <dig>  . therefore, to further characterize the role of triptolide in the signaling events triggered by lps in macrophages upstream of nfκb, we studied the expression of adapter molecules trif and myd <dig> as well as that of tlr <dig> receptor at mrna and protein levels. triptolide treatment suppressed the mrna and protein levels of lps-induced tlr <dig>  and trif  expression but not myd <dig> . suppression of poly i:c induced tlr <dig> mrna expression by triptolide, the only trif specific toll-like receptor, has not been observed by qrt-pcr . together these observations suggest that triptolide inhibition of nfκb may be directed from the receptor level for myd <dig> pathway and from the adapter level for trif pathway.

discussion
past studies have demonstrated that triptolide can induce anti-inflammatory responses in several assay systems  <cit> . however, the direct molecular targets of triptolide have remained elusive. in our previous report, we showed that triptolide significantly inhibited the secretion of inflammatory cytokines that occurred with raw  <dig>  cells when stimulated with lps  <cit> . subsequently, we performed a gene array analysis  to elucidate additional members of the immune signaling cascade that could be potential targets of triptolide activity. the results of this analysis showed that  <dig> genes, which were known to regulate inflammation were differentially expressed in stimulated raw  <dig>  cells following triptolide treatment. these  <dig> genes represented key immune signaling pathways such as tlr signaling, mapk signaling, jak-stat signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. in our present study we undertook further investigation on cellular mechanism of triptolide activity that focused on tlrs, given their upstream location in the immune signaling cascade and their increasingly recognized importance in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases  <cit> .

lps induces tlr <dig> dimerization to trigger the activation of downstream signaling pathways  <cit> . this receptor dimerization activates transcription factor nfκb, leading to the induction of inflammatory gene products such as cox- <dig> and inos  <cit> . many studies have demonstrated that triptolide and its synthetic derivatives inhibited nfκb activation induced by tlr <dig> agonist lps  <cit>  but effect of triptolide on any tlr expression was never reported. the present study shows that triptolide suppressed ligand -induced expression of tlr <dig> at mrna and protein levels . we also observed for the first time that triptolide suppressed poly  and zymosan  induced expression of cox- <dig> and inos . these observations suggest that triptolide may offer protection against wide range of infections that occurs by different tlr inductions.

the tlr-ligand activities are transduced through specific intracellular adaptor molecules, most notably myd <dig> and trif. the importance of myd <dig> and trif lies in finding that each leads to a distinct profile of immune mediators that in turn determines the phenotype of the cells that primarily are responsible for the development of adaptive immune responses  <cit> . by studying the expression of well-characterized cytokine/chemokine target genes downstream of myd <dig>  and trif   <cit>  we demonstrated differential regulation exerted by triptolide in ligand-induced  <dig>  raw macrophages. we observed that triptolide downregulated the expression of both myd88-dependent cytokine such as ccl <dig> induced by myd88-dependent ligands  and trif-dependent cytokine irg- <dig>  in a concentration dependent manner . to further confirm that both myd <dig> and trif mediated signaling are involved in triptolide activity, we showed that triptolide suppressed the nfκb translocation  to the nucleus and also the downstream expression of cox- <dig> and inos mrna in myd <dig> ko  and trif-ko  macrophages as well as in wild-type macrophages induced with tlr specific ligand, lps . these results show that inhibition of nfκb activation and cox- <dig> and inos expression by triptolide could be achieved in presence of myd <dig> or trif alone or when both are present as in wild type macrophages. these results also suggest that triptolide can block both myd88- and trif-dependent pathways that lead to nfκb transactivation. since myd <dig> and trif are the only adapters exclusively mediating all tlr signaling, it is possible that triptolide may suppress wide-range of tlr signaling through other tlrs in addition to tlr <dig>  although in the current study we focused on tlr <dig> pathway, our gene array data  as well as the observations presented in figure 1a and 1b may support the suggestion that triptolide has activities against other tlrs. when the changes in the expression of trif and myd <dig> in response to triptolide were tested , triptolide inhibited the mrna and protein expression of trif, but not myd <dig> in a dose dependent manner. a study by yamamoto et al.   <cit>  using trif knockout mice has revealed that trif is physiologically essential for tlr- <dig> mediated signaling and that trif is involved in the lps-induced myd88-independent pathway.

triptolide blocked early signaling pathways of tlrs suggesting that its inhibitory action was at the receptor and adapter molecule levels. thus, a direct interaction of triptolide with tlr <dig> may be hypothesized. this study suggests that plant compounds, such as triptolide, can modulate tlr-mediated inflammatory responses and can reduce the risk of chronic diseases, associated with exaggerated tlr activation. macrophages are the key antigen presenting cells in the pathogenesis of ra and involvement of tlr <dig> has been shown to play role in joint destruction in ra  <cit> . therefore, the present study showing interaction of triptolide with components of tlr signaling, such as tlr <dig>  are particularly relevant and support the recent promise shown in clinics against ra by botanical extracts containing triptolide  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the results from the present study suggest that the suppression of agonist-induced nfκb activation and chemokine expression by triptolide is mediated by targeting the early signaling of tlrs, particularly that of tlr <dig> in raw  <dig>  cells. triptolide downregulated the expression of tlr <dig> proteins and that of trif adapter proteins in the myd88-independent pathway of tlr <dig>  in addition gene expression profiles in response to triptolide treatment in stimulated macrophages suggest that triptolide may have multiple cellular targets contributing to its strong anti-inflammatory and immune suppressive properties.
