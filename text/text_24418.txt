BACKGROUND
human erythrocytes provide gas transport throughout the body and comprise the majority of cells in whole blood. human diseases related to red blood cells  or erythrocytes, such as anemia or malaria, affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide and present huge health concerns. although we have gained a significant understanding of how these diseases occur and many treatment options are available, we still cannot explain many aspects of these erythrocyte diseases. since the precise regulation of both coding and noncoding rnas is essential for erythrocyte development, these erythrocyte diseases are often accompanied by significant transcriptome changes. during erythropoiesis, micrornas actively regulate proliferation and/or differentiation of erythroid cells during physiological and pathological adaptions  <cit> . dysregulation of various other long and short rnas also leads to several disease states such as ineffective erythropoiesis and anemias. circulating erythrocytes can be easily obtained by blood drawing. accordingly, a detailed analysis of the erythrocyte transcriptome may provide an accessible window into the developmental history and pathophysiology of erythrocytes. however, such an analysis has been deemed impossible since circulating erythrocytes were thought to lack any genetic materials.

during terminal maturation of erythrocytes, the nucleus is extruded from progenitors, leading to anucleate cells with no further rna production. therefore, mature erythrocytes were once thought to lack rnas and have significantly lower signals from rna-binding dyes such as methylene blue. however, many studies have shown erythrocytes do contain diverse and abundant small rna species  <cit> , including noncoding rnas y <dig> and y <dig>  <cit>  as well as micrornas  <cit> . we have previously shown that higher levels of mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> reflect the hemolytic phenotype and malaria resistance of sickle erythrocytes, respectively  <cit> . additionally, both mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> reside in a locus that is regulated by gata- <dig>  are highly induced during erythroid differentiation, and are critical to erythropoiesis  <cit> . therefore, extensive profiling of the rbc transcriptome is critical for an understanding of erythrocyte biology. the rna composition of erythrocytes may also change during long-term storage for future blood transfusion  <cit> .

however, previous transcriptomic analyses were limited to known erythrocyte micrornas using microarrays  <cit> , or known micrornas from mixed reticulocyte  and erythrocyte populations using sequencing  <cit> . in addition, it is not clear whether erythrocytes also contain long  rnas that may provide valuable insights into their development and adaptations. with the recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, it is possible to perform rna-seq to identify both known and unknown transcripts.

here, we employed high-throughput sequencing to characterize both short  and long  rnas in human erythrocytes. for long rna profiling, we prepared rna-seq libraries using a protocol that allows for identification of both polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated rnas. a total of  <dig> transcripts were expressed in all three analyzed erythrocyte samples. while this number is far less than that of typical nucleated cells, these analyses established a surprisingly diverse rbc transcriptome. in parallel, short rna sequencing libraries were prepared and the mirdeep pipeline was utilized to identify both known and putative micrornas. from these analyses, we identified in mature erythrocytes an abundant, diverse set of micrornas that include both known and putative micrornas. the joint analysis of transcriptomes identified several loci with expression of both long and short rnas, suggesting their coordinated regulation of expression or processing. furthermore, we performed a functional investigation of the uncharacterized, primate-specific mir-4732-3p within the mir-144/ <dig> locus. mir-4732-3p was predicted to target both smad <dig> and smad <dig>  <cit> , components of the tgf-β pathway instrumental in fine-tuning proliferation for efficient erythropoiesis  <cit> . we provide multiple lines of experimental evidence to show that this microrna modulates tgf-β signaling by directly inhibiting smad <dig> and smad <dig> production, thus promoting proliferation during human in vitro erythroid differentiation. our study is the first to comprehensively profile the erythrocyte transcriptome, and reflects the utility of high-throughput sequencing to identify critical modulators of human development.

RESULTS
mature erythrocytes contain a diverse repertoire of long rnas
to extensively profile the complete transcriptome of mature erythrocytes, we obtained highly purified erythrocytes from healthy donors. as previously described  <cit> , blood samples were leukocyte-depleted, separated using a density gradient, and cd71- mature erythrocytes were magnetically-selected. the purity of the sample was first verified by flow cytometric analysis of cd <dig> expression  and further validated by the lack of leukocyte transcripts in the sequencing data . we isolated total rna, including small-sized rna, and constructed sequencing libraries for both short  and long  rnas from erythrocyte rna samples. rna from five individuals was used for erythrocyte short rna-seq, and rna from three individuals was used for erythrocyte long rna-seq. additionally, we isolated total rna from peripheral blood mononuclear cells  of three individuals, and rna from in vitro differentiating cd34+ erythroid progenitors  of two individuals. rna from these nucleated erythroid and peripheral blood mononuclear cells was isolated and used to prepare strand-specific long rna-seq libraries  to compare with the transcriptome of erythrocytes. for long rna-seq, hemoglobin and ribosomal rnas were first depleted from the sample, then barcoded sequencing libraries were generated using random primers. the sequencing libraries were pooled and 50 bp paired-end sequencing was performed using the illumina hiseq  <dig> system. while we did not expect abundant long rnas in mature erythrocytes, sequencing unexpectedly identified a large, diverse repertoire of long rnas in erythrocytes. the  <dig> most abundant erythrocyte transcripts  and entire catalog  of expressed long rnas are described. to determine both shared and unique aspects of the erythrocyte transcriptome, we compared the erythrocyte transcriptome with that of the pbmc and cd34+ erythroid progenitor transcriptomes. libraries from these nucleated cells were prepared and run in parallel to that of the erythrocyte long rna sequencing samples. using the same analytic methodology and threshold , we found that mature erythrocytes had far fewer expressed genes  than other nucleated blood cells such as pbmcs  and erythroid progenitors  . however, mature erythrocytes still have thousands of transcripts that may provide unique insights into erythroid biology.table  <dig> top  <dig> expressed long rnas in erythrocytes

to determine whether the long rna erythrocyte transcriptome reflects that of erythroid progenitors versus pbmcs, we used gsea  to determine the relative enrichment of the top  <dig> erythrocyte rna transcripts in the day  <dig> erythroid progenitor  vs. pbmc samples. we observed a highly significant enrichment of the top  <dig> erythrocyte transcripts in the erythroid progenitor transcriptome . together, our data shows selective retention of many long rnas previously transcribed in nucleated erythrocyte progenitors, consistent with the possibility the erythrocyte rnas were derived from erythroid precursors.

recent studies have suggested that intron retention and nonsense mediated decay may contribute to degradation of most transcripts during terminal differentiation of granulocytes  <cit>  and erythrocytes  <cit> . therefore, we analyzed the relative distribution of gene mapping regions for erythrocyte long rnas. on average, 93 % of human erythrocyte long rnas map to annotated exons of coding and noncoding rnas, far higher than that of pbmcs  and erythroid progenitors  . therefore, compared with nucleated cells, relatively few erythrocyte transcripts map to introns and intergenic regions. this difference may reflect that nucleated cells, when compared with anucleate erythrocytes, retain more unprocessed rnas in the nucleus. we also observed slightly less coverage at the 3’ of erythrocyte transcripts, compared to that of pbmc and erythroid progenitor transcripts . additionally, when the top  <dig> highest expressed erythrocyte genes were examined for go  enrichment, we found significant enrichment in pathways of cellular, protein and macromolecule biosynthesis and metabolisms, defense response, and protein ubiquitination . these categories represent both known and less appreciated functions critical for erythrocyte activities, such as protein and macromolecule synthesis for hemoglobin. ubiquitin was originally identified in erythrocytes  <cit> , and ubiquitination is essential for enucleation during erythrocyte development  <cit> . in addition, the enriched categories include go of g-protein coupled receptor  protein signaling pathways and defense response. several studies have highlighted the role of gpcrs in erythropoiesis  <cit> . the enrichment of go in defense response is unexpected and deserves investigation in future studies.

we also did not identify enrichment for inflammatory-related gene signatures typically found in leukocytes samples. none of the transcripts that encode leukocyte marker such as cd <dig>  and different cd <dig> mrnas, were expressed in any erythrocyte sample. however, these transcripts were identified in the pbmc transcriptomes. together, this sequencing data validates the successful depletion of leukocytes in the purified erythrocyte samples.

next, we examined the most abundant transcripts to obtain insights into erythroid biology. several of the most highly expressed rnas are y rnas or different components of ribonucleoprotein complexes that represent persistent expression after terminal differentiation. many of the highest expressed genes in the erythrocyte transcriptome also encode proteins highly relevant for erythroid cell differentiation. for example, bnip3l mediates mitochondrial clearance during reticulocyte terminal differentiation  <cit> . abundant slc25a <dig> encodes mitoferrin- <dig>  an essential iron importer for the synthesis of mitochondrial heme and iron-sulfur clusters in erythroblasts  <cit> , and flt encodes the ferritin light chain, a major component of intracellular iron storage  <cit> . another top expressed gene, epb <dig>  constitutes the red cell membrane cytoskeletal network, which plays a critical role in erythrocyte shape and deformability  <cit> .

in addition, several highly expressed erythrocyte transcripts encode proteins with known functions previously not associated with erythrocytes. for example, adipor <dig> encodes the cellular receptor for adiponectin, a hormone secreted by adipocytes that regulates fatty acid catabolism and glucose levels. interestingly, japanese individuals with anemia present significantly higher serum levels of adiponectin that that of unaffected individuals, yet the function of such an association remains unknown  <cit> . highly expressed tmem <dig>  and oaz <dig>  may also have undiscovered roles in erythroid biology. the discovery of these unexpected genes prompts future functional investigation and may provide unexpected insights into erythroid biology.

mature erythrocytes contain a diverse repertoire of known and putative micrornas
in parallel with long rnas, we also sequenced short  rna species from five erythrocyte samples. the short rna libraries were constructed, pooled, and then applied to the illumina hiseq  <dig> to generate a total of  <dig> , <dig> reads. to discover small-sized rnas with microrna-like characteristics, we employed the mirdeep <dig> pipeline  <cit>  , a widely used  <cit>  probabilistic model algorithm based on canonical microrna precursor processing, and is therefore not limited to previously annotated or highly conserved micrornas.fig.  <dig> microrna identification pipeline and microrna population characteristics. a deep sequencing of short rnas from mature rbcs was performed using the illumina hiseq technology. raw sequences were mapped to the genome, filtered through mirdeep, and categorized. identified microrna loci were cross-referenced with mirbase  and ucsc genome browser  to distinguish between candidate novel and known micrornas. b relative percentages  of read numbers for top  <dig> micrornas among five different samples. percentages are averages based on total number of known, mature microrna reads for each sample. c relative percentage representation of genomic location for both known and putative micrornas. listed genomic locations for mature microrna sequences are relative to refseq annotated transcripts in ucsc genome browser . for mature microrna sequences spanning both introns and coding region, or utr and coding regions of alternative transcripts, sequence is listed in coding region. d relative percentage representation of sequence conservation for both known and putative micrornas. conservation of mature microrna sequence indicates exact sequence alignment in listed number of species , allowing for up to one base mismatch outside of the microrna seed sequence , and no mismatches within the seed sequence



we employed a cutoff for micrornas based on a mirdeep score of ≥ <dig>  and ≥  <dig> reads in at least one sample, like that previously used  <cit> . in all, we identified  <dig> micrornas. for the top  <dig> identified micrornas, similar percentages of reads were found in all five erythrocyte samples , indicating reproducible expression of the most highly expressed micrornas. all expressed known micrornas  and all putative micrornas  are shown.

several of the most abundant micrornas in our dataset were previously shown to be enriched in human erythrocytes, thus validating our findings. for example, the most abundant microrna, mir-486-5p, accelerates erythroid differentiation  <cit> , and its overexpression was associated with an erythroid-like subtype of megakaryocytic leukemia  <cit> . mir-451a and mir-144-3p are both gata-1-responsive micrornas upregulated during erythroid differentiation and play important roles in the anti-stress capacity of erythrocytes . additionally, mir- <dig>  mir-92a, and the let- <dig> family of micrornas are all among the most abundant erythrocyte micrornas from previous studies  <cit> . importantly, high plasma levels of mir-486-5p, mir-92a, mir- <dig> and mir-451a are associated with increased red cell hemolysis in human plasma samples, consistent with their high abundance in erythrocytes  <cit> . hence, our sequencing data identified a large number of erythrocyte micrornas. while most of these micrornas were previously associated with erythrocytes, several abundant micrornas, such as mir-182-5p, have not been previously associated with erythroid cells.

the putative micrornas identified by mirdeep were further manually annotated and curated using both the ucsc genome browser  and mirbase . these analyses lead to  <dig> putative unannotated micrornas, and selected microrna sequences that met criteria for putative micrornas are shown . we then determined the relative genomic location and sequence conservation for both known and putative erythrocyte micrornas. the majority of both known  and putative  micrornas mapped to intergenic or intronic regions, with few micrornas mapped to coding, untranslated, or long ncrna regions . these results indicate that overall, newly identified putative erythrocyte micrornas reside in similar genomic regions to that of known micrornas. we also examined the evolutionary conservation of both known and putative micrornas across six species  by the number of species in which each full, mature microrna sequence was found . known micrornas were identified in more species  than putative micrornas , and were therefore more conserved. additionally, most putative microrna sequences  were only identified in primates, while far fewer known micrornas were only identified primates . this disparity highlights the utility of mirdeep to identify putative micrornas that are mostly primate-specific.

joint analysis of erythrocyte long and short rna transcriptomes reveals novel elements within the mir-144/ <dig> locus
next, we performed a joint analysis of the long and short rna erythrocyte transcriptomes. to determine whether erythrocyte micrornas may post-transcriptionally regulate erythrocyte mrnas, we assessed whether these micrornas may contribute to selective enrichment or depletion of erythrocyte mrnas. gsea was used to evaluate the potential enrichment and depletion of the predicated target mrnas for the top six expressed erythrocyte micrornas: mir-486-5p, mir-92-3p, mir-16-5p, let-7a/f, and mir- <dig> in erythrocyte mrnas, compared to that of pbmc mrnas. we observed that the target mrnas of these top expressed mirnas were not significantly enriched or depleted in the erythrocyte mrna dataset .

next, we identified long and short rnas that map to adjacent regions. several long rna transcripts that spanned different annotated pre-microrna loci were identified . together, we observed three instances of co-expression for both erythrocyte micrornas and long rnas spanning pre-microrna loci. there are two distinct patterns of co-expression. in the first pattern, we observed co-expression of both micrornas and long rna transcripts spanning entire pre-micrornas, including 5’ and 3’ flanking regions in two loci . in the second pattern, we observed co-expression a long rna spanning only the 5’ portion of the mir- <dig> pre-microrna, proximal to the mir-144/ <dig> region; this lncrna was confirmed via rt-pcr . we focused on the co-expressed micrornas and the long rna within the mir-144/ <dig> locus for several reasons . this locus has been widely implicated in erythropoiesis, and all rnas in this locus contain a much higher coverage  than that of rnas in other co-expression loci. interestingly, when the sequencing reads were mapped to the mir-144/ <dig> locus, we found several rna reads mapped to distinct elements 5’ of pre-mir- <dig>  these rnas include a ~250 nt lncrna spanning the 5’ hairpin region of pre-mir- <dig>  as well as mir-4732-5p and -3p .fig.  <dig> genomic locations and expression dynamics of noncoding rnas in the mir-144/ <dig> locus. a location, sequence read length, relative read number, and vertebrate conservation of noncoding rnas within the chromosome  <dig> mir-144/ <dig> locus according to ucsc genome browser . solid lines indicate average read numbers, dotted lines represent highest and lowest standard deviations of read numbers across the samples. the strand orientation of each noncoding rna is indicated. b expression of mir-144-5p, mir-4732-3p, and mir-4732-5p, during cd34+ erythroid differentiation using progenitors from three different individuals. differentiation is listed from day  <dig> to day  <dig>  u <dig> snrna was used as a loading control, with fold difference set relative to day  <dig>  c predicted folding structure for the mir- <dig> pre-microrna according to mirdeep, and frequency of reads for mature micrornas from one representative sample. the most prevalent mature read sequences for mir-4732-3p  and mir-4732-5p  are shown. d sequence conservation of mir-4732-3p in listed species. primates are listed adjacent to white box, non-primates listed adjacent to black box. seed sequence is boxed, and base mismatches with human mir-4732-3p are highlighted in red



among the newly identified erythrocyte rnas, we investigated the functional role of mir-4732-3p for several reasons. first, both mir-4732-5p and -3p are previously uncharacterized. second, mir-4732-3p is much more highly expressed than mir-4732-5p. additionally, proximal micrornas mir-451a and mir-144-3p are significantly induced during erythroid differentiation  <cit> . we used real-time pcr to determine the expression dynamics of mir-4732-3p and other erythrocyte micrornas at different time points during in vitro differentiation of cd34+ erythroid progenitors . similar to mir-451a and mir-144-3p  <cit> , both mir-144-5p and mir-4732-3p were also upregulated during erythropoiesis . however, mir-4732-5p levels were less dramatically upregulated during erythropoiesis. additionally, mir-486-5p was upregulated and mir- <dig> was downregulated during differentiation, as previously described  <cit>  , indicating successful differentiation of our in vitro erythroid culture. upregulation of mir-4732-3p, as well as its physical proximity to the mir-144/ <dig> locus suggests its similar regulation and functional role during erythroid development.

mirdeep maps mir- <dig> to a predicted pre-microrna canonical stem-loop folding structure with distinct 5p- and 3p- mature sequence reads , indicative of a bona fide microrna. interestingly, mir-4732-3p is primate-specific, with full seed sequence identical only among primates. within non-primate species, it is poorly conserved, with both seed and non-seed mismatches . in contrast, mir-451a, mir-144-3p, and mir-144-5p are all highly conserved among primate and non-primate species . together, the significant mirdeep score , predicted pre-microrna structure, and proximity to the mir-144/ <dig> locus underscores the authenticity and potential functional relevance of mir-4732-3p.

mir-4732-3p directly regulates smad <dig> and smad4
using the microrna target prediction tool targetscan  <cit> ,  <dig> genes were predicted to be regulated by mir-4732-3p . we performed a gather analysis  <cit>  to identify the related predicted target pathways among the target genes. we identified significant enrichment in tgf-β signaling, with literature networks and protein-binding networks for smad <dig>  <cit> . smad <dig> and smad <dig> are both predicted to be regulated by mir-4732-3p, with conserved seed sequence binding sites in most species. tgf-β family cytokines bind to associated membrane receptors, promoting receptor-mediated phosphorylation of smad <dig> and smad <dig> to associate with smad <dig>  <cit> . this activated smad2/ <dig> complex binds to competing effectors smad <dig> or tifγ to fine-tune a balance between erythroid differentiation and proliferation  <cit> . tgf-β activates the expression of several smad <dig> target genes, including pai- <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and bax  <cit> , shown to reduce cell viability and proliferation. for example, pai- <dig>  bim, and bax act as activators of apoptosis and trigger cell death  <cit> . in addition, p <dig> is a potent cell cycle inhibitor that binds to and inhibits the activity of cyclin-cdk <dig>  −cdk <dig>  and -cdk4/ <dig> complexes  <cit> . the induction of these genes by tgf-β is consistent with ability of tgf-β to inhibit proliferation and increase cell death during erythropoiesis  <cit> . inhibition of smad <dig> or smad <dig> results in increased erythroid cell proliferation , but their effects on differentiation are inconsistent. however, much remains unknown about the upstream signals that coordinate the regulation of these factors.

based on these predictions and biological relevance, we investigated the potential of mir-4732-3p to regulate smad <dig> and smad <dig> . to test whether both of these predicted targets contain bona fide repressive elements, portions of 3’utr of smad <dig> and smad <dig>  including the predicted target sites, were cloned into a dual luciferase reporter. as shown, transfection with a mir-4732-3p mimic significantly repressed normalized renilla 3’ utr reporter activities of both smad <dig> and smad <dig> in k562s, indicating the ability of mir-4732-3p to regulate smad2/ <dig> . to determine whether endogenous mir-4732-3p repression would affect reporter expression, we inhibited mir-4732-3p with an antisense oligonucleotide  and observed increased relative renilla reporter activities for both smad <dig> and smad <dig> . this regulation occurs through the predicted target mir-4732-3p binding sites, as mutation of the respective target sequences in the 3’ utr of smad <dig> and  <dig> abrogated the endogenous microrna-mediated luciferase repression .fig.  <dig> mir-4732-3p directly regulates smad <dig> and smad <dig>  a alignment of mir-4732-3p and predicted target sites in the 3’ utr of smad <dig> and smad <dig>  with mutated binding sites underlined. b relative changes of reporter activities in k562s co-transfected with luciferase constructs and indicated microrna mimics. a portion the smad <dig> and the smad <dig> 3’utrs were cloned downstream of renilla in separate psicheck- <dig> vectors  . c relative changes of reporter activities in k562s co-transfected with luciferase constructs and microrna-blocking antisense oligonucleotides   . d relative changes of reporter activities in k562s transfected with wild-type  or mutated  smad <dig> or smad <dig> 3’utr constructs  . e western blots of smad <dig> and smad <dig> protein expression 24 h after transfection of k562s with indicated microrna mimics or f microrna asos. α-tubulin was used as a loading control for normalization. protein desitometric values are listed. the fold change of expression for each treatment group was first normalized to alpha tubulin input for that treatment, then ratio set relative to the control treatment



to understand the in vivo relevance of the regulatory relationship between mir-4732-3p and smad2/smad <dig>  we determined whether mir-4732-3p inhibits the protein levels of smad <dig> and smad <dig> . transfection of mir-4732-3p mimics in k562s reduced the protein levels of both smad <dig> and smad <dig> , whereas inhibition of mir-4732-3p increased the levels of smad <dig> and smad <dig> protein . thus, mir-4732-3p inhibits the protein levels of both smad <dig> and smad <dig> through a canonical microrna-mediated regulation of 3’ utrs.

mir-4732-3p regulates the tgf-β signaling cascade
next, we assessed whether mir-4732-3p-mediated downregulation of smad <dig> and smad <dig> would affect tgf-β signaling. tgf-β pathway activities were measured with a firefly luciferase tgf-β reporter construct driven by the smad4-dependent caga element promoter   <cit> . overexpression of mir-4732-3p in k562s resulted in a significant reduction in relative reporter luciferase values , demonstrating that mir-4732-3p suppresses smad4-mediated transcription activities. additionally, we determined whether mir-4732-3p overexpression may affect the level of smad4-dependent target genes, such as pai- <dig>  p <dig>  bim, and bax  <cit> . overexpression of mir-4732-3p significantly reduced the expression of all these smad4-regulated genes .fig.  <dig> mir-4732-3p regulates tgf-β signaling and promotes erythroid cell proliferation. a relative changes of tgf-β reporter activities in k <dig> cells co-transfected with luciferase constructs and microrna mimics  . cells were transfected with microrna mimic, smad4-responsive firefly construct, and a separate renilla construct as a transfection control. b relative mrna levels of p <dig>  pai- <dig>  bax, and bim 24 h after transfection of k562s with microrna mimics. levels were determined using qpcr and normalized by gapdh  . c total cell number of primary cd <dig> erythroid progenitors  <dig> and 72 h after equal numbers of cells were transfected with indicated microrna mimics on day  <dig> of differentiation  . d total cell number of primary cd <dig> erythroid progenitors 24 h after equal numbers of cells were transfected with indicated combinations of microrna mimics and overexpression constructs on day  <dig> of differentiation  



given the ability to suppress tgf-β signaling activity, we hypothesized that mir-4732-3p may promote proliferation by suppressing smad <dig> and smad <dig>  consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of mir-4732-3p in differentiating cd34+ erythroid progenitors resulted in a significant increase in total cell number . furthermore, the mir-4732-3p-mediated increase in cell number was abolished by overexpression of smad <dig> and smad <dig> with cdna constructs lacking mir-4732-3p-responsive 3’utrs . these results indicated that mir-4732-3p increased erythroid cell number by repressing the levels of smad2/ <dig>  together, these data are consistent with the possibility that mir-4732-3p modulates tgf-β signaling to promote erythroid cell survival and production during erythropoiesis.

discussion
the discovery of abundant and diverse erythrocyte rnas opens the possibility of using these readily accessible genetic materials as biomarkers to monitor various human diseases and treatments that involve erythroid cells. sequencing allows for characterization and quantification of not only annotated rnas, but also novel mrna isoforms and noncoding rnas. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that has employed high-throughput sequencing to extensively profile both the long and short rna transcriptomes of human erythrocytes.

here we focus on the primate-specific mir-4732-3p. while this microrna has been annotated in mirbase , it has few reads  in other datasets and is uncharacterized. we found that mir-4732-3p is an abundant erythrocyte microrna within the erythroid-enriched mir-144/ <dig> locus. the identification of multiple elements within the mir-144/ <dig> cluster is not surprising, as mir- <dig> and mir- <dig> are both highly expressed and upregulated by gata <dig> during erythrocyte development  <cit> . considering the proximity of these newly identified noncoding rnas to this locus, these rnas are also likely upregulated by gata <dig>  in addition, the lncrna overlapping mir- <dig> may exist as a truncated form of a longer rna precursor which undergoes further processing for production of the adjacent micrornas within this locus. conversely, this lncrna may simply be overlapping within this region and not subject to coordinated processing and regulation of adjacent noncoding rnas. we suggest further investigation into the potential rna processing mechanisms within this locus and functions of these noncoding rnas in erythroid cells.

the human erythrocyte is one of the most commonly studied cell types, often used as a model system to understand the general principles of molecular genetics, biochemistry, membrane biology, and cell physiology. as new rna synthesis ends with nuclear extrusion, the expression level of any rna species is determined mainly by its turnover and decay  <cit> . the selective persistence of particular rnas in mature erythrocytes likely reflects associated decay kinetics. given the relative stability of micrornas, plasma micrornas have been proposed as valuable biomarkers. several studies have suggested that select plasma micrornas are highly associated with hemolysis. many erythrocyte micrornas, including mir-92a and mir-486-5p, have been proposed as candidate plasma biomarkers for human diseases, yet red cell lysis may contribute to this association, a concern that has been raised previously  <cit> .

as many micrornas are highly conserved between species  <cit> , few primate-specific micrornas have been characterized  <cit> . primate-specific micrornas are generally associated with brain function, immune response, or cancer progression. our study is the first to identify the role of a primate-specific microrna in hematopoiesis. mir-4732-3p provides an additional layer of regulation for primate erythropoiesis. although mouse and other non-primate models have provided valuable insight into human physiology and disease, considerable divergence still exists between human and mouse erythropoiesis  <cit> . notably, several groups have observed mild anemic phenotypes with deletion of the abbreviated mir-144/ <dig> locus in mice, yet these studies did not take into account potential regulatory factors flanking this site  <cit> . our study further illustrates the discrepancy between the regulatory mechanisms of human and mouse erythropoiesis and supports investigation specifically within human models to consider mechanisms that are not evolutionarily conserved.

in this study, we demonstrated that mir-4732-3p inhibits tgf-β signaling to promote erythroid cell expansion during differentiation. as inhibition of smad <dig> and smad <dig> via rnai-mediated mechanisms reflects phenotypes previously documented  <cit> , this microrna modulates smad <dig> and smad <dig> activities to achieve similar phenotypes. dysregulation of the tgf-β pathway has been implicated in several human erythroid diseases. for example, overactivation of tgf-β signaling has been extensively reported in β-thalassemia and mds , both characterized by ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia  <cit> . though other mrna targets and phenotypes associated with mir-4732-3p have yet to be elucidated, mir-4732-3p represents a unique, endogenous tgf-β signaling inhibitor that promotes erythroid expansion, and has the potential to be manipulated as a biomarker or novel therapeutic for various anemia disorders.

CONCLUSIONS
here we describe the first comprehensive, as well as joint analysis of the human erythrocyte transcriptome. we have made several important observations. first, in addition to micrornas, mature erythrocytes also contain long transcripts. although smaller in number, erythrocyte long transcripts are highly enriched in annotated exons and largely encode proteins critical to erythrocyte differentiation and functions. therefore, quantitative analysis of the erythrocyte transcriptome may reflect erythrocyte development history and pathological adaptations. second, mirdeep identified  <dig> known and  <dig> putative novel micrornas that include many micrornas that are either uncharacterized, or not previously associated with erythrocytes. third, the joint analysis of long and short transcripts identified a long noncoding rna and previously uncharacterized micrornas in the mir-144/ <dig> locus. finally, functional studies demonstrate the primate-specific microrna mir-4732-3p regulates the tgf-β pathway during human erythropoiesis. this study presents a novel post-transcriptional modulator of erythroid development, and features a new transcriptomic data set that provides new insights into erythroid biology.
