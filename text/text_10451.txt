BACKGROUND
most multicellular life is heavily dependent on oxygen for survival. multicellular organisms inhabit environments that have changing oxygen availability, and show conserved mechanisms to cope with extremes of oxygen availability which can occur both in their environment and within their tissues  <cit> . this high level of conservation means that non-mammalian model organisms can be employed to study the regulation of the hypoxic response. furthermore, studies in fish might also provide the basis to understand how such responses are modified in aquatic environments, where oxygen availability can widely vary  <cit> .

hypoxia inducible factor  is central to the response to the lack of oxygen in the environment  <cit> . in order to maintain homeostasis; cells, tissues and organisms adapt to first cope with the lack of oxygen and then act to redress the underlying cause  <cit> . in order to reduce oxygen consumption, the hif transcription factor orchestrates a metabolic shift from aerobic metabolism to glycolysis. it leads to: 1) alteration in the composition of the electron transport chain  <cit> . 2) induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase switching metabolism away from oxidative phosphorylation  <cit> . 3) up-regulation of glycolytic genes  <cit> . 4) regulation of mitochondrial turnover  <cit> . the hif pathway also increases glucose trafficking into the cell by up-regulation of the glucose transporter glut <dig>  <cit> . to counteract hypoxia, hif stimulates erythrocyte production through up-regulation of epo and a host of iron absorption related genes , and by increasing angiogenesis through increased production of angiogenic factors, like vegf . more recently, hif has been implicated in lipid processing, mice carrying a hepatic knockout of vhl develop severe hepatic steatosis with impaired fatty acid oxidation, decreased lipogenic gene expression, and increased lipid storage capacity  <cit> . activation of the hif pathway is implicated in tumour development and growth, as the interior of most solid tumours is hypoxic. furthermore loss-of-heterozygosity of vhl leads to activation of hifs, which is essential for vhl-driven tumorigenesis .

the hif transcription factor is a basic-helix-loop-helix heterodimer consisting of an αand β subunit  <cit> . the expression of hif-α is regulated by the prolyl-hydroxylase domain containing enzymes , which act to hydroxylate hif-α under conditions of plentiful oxygen, leading to its recognition by von hippel lindau  and subsequent proteosomal degradation . thus under conditions of normoxia, hif-α is continually degraded. under hypoxic conditions or, for instance, after mutation of vhl, the breakdown of hif-α is inhibited. this leads to its translocation into the nucleus to bind hif-β, creating the hif dimer. this dimer is then capable of binding to hypoxia response elements  within the genome which leads to transcriptional activation of target genes  <cit> . hre’s are characterised by a rcgtg binding motif, functional motifs are often found in the promoters of hypoxia response genes but have also been seen to act distally  <cit> . previous work from the ratcliffe and mole labs have used the mcf- <dig> breast cancer cell line, stimulated using the hydroxylase inhibitor dimethyloxalylglycine  or ≤ <dig> % oxygen for  <dig> h in order activate the hif response. these screens identified binding sites for both hif-1α and hif-2α binding sites using chip-chip  <cit>  and chip-seq  <cit> . both studies identify the canonical hre, with mole et al., finding  <dig> hif-1α binding sites  and  <dig> hif-2α binding sites . similarly, the schödel study found  <dig> hif-1α binding sites  and  <dig> hif-2α binding sites   <cit> . additionally, gene set enrichment analysis found strong correlation between hif binding sites and up-regulation of genes, whilst there was no correlation between down-regulated genes  <cit> . contrary to the situation humans, in zebrafish, few functional hres have been defined. the hres which likely control erythropoietin, igfbp1a and period1b expression in zebrafish have been identified, showing an identical motif to human . the hres for four hif-2α specific genes, birc5a/b and leg1a/b have been identified  <cit> . thus, in order to further develop the zebrafish as a model for research into hypoxic signalling, there is scope for systematic identification hif binding sites.

heterozygous mutation of vhl in humans predisposes affected individuals to the development of highly vascularised tumours and cysts upon loss of heterozygosity of the remaining vhl allele, this is known as vhl disease  <cit> . in order to study this disease further, the vhl mutant zebrafish line was created. homozygous mutants display a systemic hypoxic response that occurs once the remaining maternal vhl mrna is depleted  <cit> . the earliest activation of the hif pathway can be seen by  <dig> h post fertilisation  with up-regulation of phd <dig> , ndufa <dig> and ldha1a detectable by in situ hybridisation  <cit> . activation of the hypoxic response manifests itself in increased vegf receptor-dependent increases in neovascularisation  <cit> . in addition, vhl mutants exhibit strong increases in both red and white blood cell lineages, reminiscent of chuvash polycythemia. this is a human disease caused by particular vhl mutations  <cit> . zebrafish vhl mutants display pronephric abnormalities from soon after the nascent kidney becomes functional., interestingly, the cells of the pronephros display a phenotype reminiscent of the clear cell phenotype seen in clear cell renal cell carcinoma , a disease caused by loss of heterozygosity of vhl, but do not develop tumours or cysts  <cit> . we chose the vhl mutant line as a model for hypoxia as we believed that genetic inactivation of vhl offered a stronger and more stable activation of the hif pathway than pharmacological activation or physical hypoxia, whilst avoiding complications due to developmental retardation and other abnormalities resulting secondarily from severe hypoxia.

here we report analysis of the gene expression changes in vhl mutant embryos, finding differential regulation of both key hypoxia response genes and genes not commonly associated with mutation of vhl. we report analysis of the hif-1α binding sites within both vhl mutant and wild-type samples, finding a greater number binding sites than expected from mammalian studies  <cit> , and identify a hre motif in zebrafish.

RESULTS
identification of genes differentially expressed in vhl mutant zebrafish
vhl mutant zebrafish has been previously shown to exhibit a systemic hypoxic response with increased levels of hif-1α seen in vhl deficient tumours  <cit> . here we perform one-colour microarray analysis using an agilent platform to determine the changes in gene expression caused by homozygous mutation of vhl at 4dpf. we chose to perform experiments at 4dpf because the phenotype of vhl mutants is clearly developed by 4dpf but embryos still appear healthy, without oedema. therefore, using this time point may reduce the number of gene expression changes associated with secondary complications when compared to a later stage of development. for both wild-type and vhl mutant conditions, three biological replicates were created, with each replicate consisting of material from  <dig> embryos. vhl samples were compared against wild-type samples using limma analysis for single channel microarray data utilising background correction and quantile data normalisation . a p-value of ≤ <dig>  was used as a cut-off for significance and entities with a fold-change of greater or equal to two were considered to be differentially regulated. this produced a probeset of  <dig> differentially regulated entities, of these,  <dig> had unique unigene id’s, which corresponded to  <dig> genes with unique unigene description. of these genes,  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were down-regulated . the complete list of expressed entities can be found in additional file  <dig> 

the transcriptional response to hypoxia has been well studied in mammalian cells and zebrafish have been used as a model to study this pathway  <cit> . in our microarray we detected significant up-regulation of an array of hypoxia response genes in vhl mutants. we detect increased expression of genes that regulate the hif pathway itself, such as egl nine homolog  <dig>  ) which our lab has utilised as a live hypoxia reporter  <cit> . similarly, we see an increase in classical hypoxia response genes such as, the key regulator of angiogenesis vascular endothelial growth factor ab   <cit> . a number of glycolytic genes were also significantly up-regulated; 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose- <dig> -biphosphatase  <dig>   <cit> , and lactate dehydrogenase a <dig>   <cit> . additionally, a number of genes relating to processing of the extracellular matrix were up-regulated, including; procollagen-lysine  <dig>  2-oxoglutarate 5-dioxygenase 1a   <cit>  and procollagen-proline, 2-oxoglutarate 4-dioxygenase , alpha polypeptide  <dig>   <cit> . interestingly, we see a large number of down-regulated genes. such transcriptional repression is not commonly associated with activation of the hif response in cellular models  <cit> .

these gene expression changes in vhl mutants highlighted above were reflected in the results of gene ontology  term based analysis performed using database for annotation, visualization and integrated discovery   <cit> . the complete entity lists of differentially regulated genes in vhl mutants  were uploaded to david using unigene id as the identifier and analysed on the basis of the biological processes that they are involved in. enrichment of biological processes for up-regulated transcripts found key terms associated with the hypoxic response such as; “oxygen transport”, “glycolysis” and “hemopoiesis”, strongly implicating activation of the hif-pathway  <cit> . down-regulated transcripts were enriched in a number of biological processes associated with lipid processing such as; “lipid biosynthetic process” and “fatty acid metabolic process”. the complete list of enriched biological processes for both up- and down-regulated transcripts can be found in additional file  <dig> 

in order to validate of our microarray results, quantification of fold-changes by quantitative polymerase chain reaction  was performed using the pfaffl method  <cit>  and the correlation between these and the microarray fold changes was assessed using spearman’s rho. q-pcr was performed for  <dig> up-regulated genes with normalisation against the reference genes  <dig> s and wnt5a, both of which have been used previously as reference genes for quantification of mrna in zebrafish  <cit> . correlation was significant between the fold-changes detected by microarray and by q-pcr analysis regardless of which reference gene was used for the qpcr analysis , an observation that is in line with results from other studies  <cit> .

chip-qpcr experiments show specific enrichment for the epo-hre in vhl mutants
the hif binding consensus sequence, the hypoxia response element, has been widely studied in mammalian cells; from its initial identification due to its association with transcriptional activation of erythropoietin, to extensive chip-sequencing of cells exposed to hypoxic conditions  <cit> . in fish, a functional hre that influences the expression of erythropoietin has been identified, with the consensus sequence being identical to that found in mammals   <cit> . we tested several custom-made/commercial hif-1α antibodies for their suitability for chip. the first step was to demonstrate that the hif-1α antibody was able to specifically bind to the epo-hre. this was achieved by performing chip followed by q-pcr for the region surrounding the previously identified hre  <cit> . the dna for this was isolated from a group of  <dig> wild-type larvae pooled into a single sample and  <dig> vhl mutant larvae pooled into a separate sample, this dna was later used for the chip-seq experiments. enrichment was measured using a variation on the pfaffl method  <cit> , where the ct value for both the chip and the input control are calculated for the region of interest and additionally for a distal control region. we would expect that in vhl mutants, there would be greater enrichment for the region directly over the hre than for regions that are both up- and down-stream to it, whereas the enrichment would not be seen in wild-type chip material. only one antiserum gave a positive result : a polyclonal fish-specific hif-1α antibody used previously to identify hif-1α in hypoxia-treated zebrafish  <cit>  this serum also gives good signals in western blots of larval zebrafish  <cit> . therefore, this antiserum was used for the chip-seq experiments.fig.  <dig> 
vhl mutants shows specific enrichment for the epo-hre. graph showing the result of a chip-qpcr experiment. in vhl mutants hif is stabilised and is expected to bind to hres. strong enrichment  for the region spanning the epo-hre is seen in vhl mutants, whereas the wild-type hre, and flanking regions both up- and down-stream of the hre are much less enriched. a control region ~2kb distally was used for comparison. details for the sequences and relative positions of primers as well as the fold change calculation can be found in the additional file  <dig> and the methods section



identification of hif-1α binding sites in the zebrafish genome
as few hif-1α binding sites have been identified in zebrafish and chip-sequencing has emerged as an appropriate technology for genome-wide dna binding site analysis in zebrafish, we decided to sequence the chip material isolated from both wild-type and vhl mutants using one biological replicate of  <dig> embryos for each. chip material was prepared for library submission using the tru-seq low input library preparation kit,  and then sequenced using the illumina platform. the sequencing data was analysed using model-based analysis of chip-seq   which was able to call the number of peaks enriched in the chip material for vhl and wild-type with a p-value of ≤ 1x10− <dig> . in total, there were  <dig> peaks for wild-type and  <dig> peaks for vhl with a p-value of ≤10− <dig>  of  <dig> peaks found in the wild-type sample,  <dig> peaks overlapped the  <dig> peaks found in the vhl sample, equating to  <dig>  %. notably, wild-type peaks are shorter on average , and on a number of occasions multiple wild-type peaks fall within a single vhl peak. when the number of tags was examined, the  <dig> vhl peaks represented  <dig> tags and the  <dig> wild-type peaks represented  <dig> tags.

in order to perform an unbiased identification of hif-1α binding sites, de novo motif analysis was carried out using multiple em for motif elicitation   using ± <dig> bp from the summits of the top  <dig> peaks from the vhl mutant data set  <cit> . this identified an rcgtg motif that is also observed in human hres   <cit> . similar analysis using the wild-type data set did not find any motifs. the rcgtg motif was then used to search against both the wild-type and vhl mutant data sets. we searched for the rcgtg motif in  <dig> bp surrounding the summit. this analysis identified  <dig> unique peaks in the wild-type data set and  <dig> unique peaks in vhl data set  <cit> . notably, of the  <dig> wild-type hre peaks,  <dig> were found to overlap more than  <dig> % with the vhl peaks. when analysed using motif occurrence detection suite   with an e-value cut-off of  <dig>  and zv <dig> genome as a background, there was some degree of correlation between the peak p-value and presence of the rcgtg motif when peaks were ordered by p-value and binned into groups of  <dig> . importantly, when the distribution of the rcgtg motif within the surrounding  <dig> base pairs of the peak was analysed, a strong preference for the motif to be found close to the summit of the peak was observed . this is important as the rcgtg motif is over represented in the genome, with it occurring at greater than one in every  <dig> bp by chance.fig.  <dig> the primary motif found in vhl mutant chip-peaks. the most significant  <dig> peaks from the sequencing of the vhl mutant chip material were analysed for the presence of sequence motifs in the  <dig> bp surrounding the centre of the peak using meme. this identified a motif that closely resembles the known hre consensus  <cit> . the y-axis shows the relative entropy in bits, a measure of the probability that the letter will be found at that position relative to the total information content of the stack, the x-axis shows the width of the motif in base pairs. more information can be found on the meme website 

fig.  <dig> hres are enriched in the most significant peaks. the peaks from our hif chip-seq experiment were ranked according to p-value, a measure of their height above the  background of mapped sequence tags. they were then binned into groups of  <dig>  the percentage of peaks containing an hre was then calculated, this showed that the most significant peaks show enrichment for hre’s

fig.  <dig> the rcgtg/hre motif is enriched in regions in close proximity to the peak summit. the position relative to the peak summit of the total number of hre’s in the vhl mutant data set was assessed. the x axis displays the distance from the summit in basepairs, and the y-axis the number of hres that fall into a given window. the majority of peaks are found with ± <dig> bp of the summit when the surrounding  <dig> kb was analysed



when we examine the distribution of the hif-1α binding sites with respect to the nearest transcriptional start site  we see that  <dig> % of them fall within the tss and  <dig> % fall within the promoter region but that they may also fall at greater distances . the data detailing the positions of the chip peaks can be found in: additional file  <dig> - unfiltered chip sequencing peaks for vhl mutants, additional file  <dig> – vhl chip sequencing peaks filtered for presence of a hre, additional file  <dig> – unfiltered chip sequencing peaks for wild-type, and additional file  <dig> – wild-type chip sequencing peaks filtered for presence of a hre.fig.  <dig> the distribution of hif-1α binding sites in vhl mutant zebrafish. a: definitions of genomic regions. tss: if peak summit is 1kb up or down-stream of the tss of the closest gene . promoter: from -5kb upstream to upstream limit of the tss . inside: inside the gene, including introns and exons but excluding areas covered by the tss. proximal:  <dig> kb up- and down-stream of the limits of the promoter and inside region. distal: 90kb up- and down-stream of the proximal regions. desert: any region up- or down-stream of the distal regions. b: the proportion of peaks containing hre’s that fall within a given region for vhl mutants. c: the proportions of the genome that are described by the regions defined in a




validation of chip-seq peaks
to validate the chip-seq peaks in vhl,  <dig> highly significant peaks containing a hre, were selected and chip-qpcr was performed using primers designed around the region containing the hre. as negative controls, distant regions which did not contain a peak were selected. qpcr was performed using input and chip material and enrichment for the region of interest was determined using a variation on the pfaffl method as described earlier. in samples from the vhl chip, all  <dig> regions showed enrichment of over twenty fold regardless of which control region was used. additional file  <dig> shows the fold change values which represent peak enrichment, using the least significant control region, approximately 1kb down-stream of jmjd <dig>  in wild-type chip materials, a degree of enrichment was seen for many peaks, which indicates there may be a low level of hif-1α binding. this is put into context by comparing the ratio of fold change between vhl and wild-type. in all but one case vhl was seen to be more strongly enriched often by more than  <dig> fold. with these findings, alongside the observation of the strong representation of hre’s proximal to the peak summit, we are satisfied that the peaks found in vhl mutant chip-seq represent hif-1α binding.

comparison of microarray and chip-seq data
in order to investigate the extent to which hif-1α binding influences the transcriptional profile of vhl mutant zebrafish, we compared the gene expression changes in vhl vs. wt and the peaks for the hif-1α chip performed using vhl mutant embryos.

as we found such a high number of hif-1α binding sites in vhl mutant samples , we were concerned that this could lead to a high number of false associations with genes in their vicinity. in order to minimise this, we chose to examine region-gene associations where the peak is within ±1kb of the tss. we achieved this by mapping the region-gene associations using genomic region enrichment analysis tool  selecting for the two nearest genes, then selecting genes within ±1kb of the tss  <cit> . this found  <dig> gene associations from  <dig> of the peaks that fall within ±1kb of the tss. we examined the degree of overlap between the microarray data and the genes associated with hif-1α peaks in their tss. we found that of the  <dig> up-regulated genes ,  <dig> of these were associated with hif-1α peaks within ±1kb of their tss. whilst of the  <dig> down-regulated genes,  <dig> were associated hif-1α binding peaks within ±1kb of their tss. in order to assess the significance of the intersection between the differentially regulated genes in the microarray and the genes associated with hif-1α dna binding ±1kb of their tss, we performed hypergeometric analysis. our microarray contained  <dig> genes with a unique gene symbol, when great was used to assess the number of genes with hif-1α dna binding ±1kb of their tss,  <dig> genes were found, with  <dig> of these being included in the microarray. when the probability that the up-regulated genes  associated with chip-seq peaks in vhl mutants  occurred by chance was assessed, hypergeometric testing gave a probability of ≤ <dig>  10− <dig>  when the probability that down-regulated genes  associated with chip-seq peaks in vhl mutants  occurred by chance was assessed, a hypergeometric testing gave a probability of ≤ <dig> . additional file  <dig> shows the genes and the peaks associated with them.

overall, if a gene is up-regulated, the chance that it contains a hre-peak near the tss is about four times higher than if it is down-regulated and about  <dig>  times more than expected by chance. however, the probability of whether a chip seq peak contains an hre is not related to whether it is associated with an up- or down- regulated gene. intriguingly, non-hre peaks show similar enrichment in tss regions and are found to be associated with up-regulated genes. for instance,  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  of the peaks were closely associated with tss regions.

comparison with published hre data in zebrafish and human
in zebrafish hres are known for leg1a/b, birc5a/b, period1b, epo and igfbp1a. we confirmed peaks at the predicted position for igfbp1a, epo, and peaks coinciding with hres e <dig> and e <dig> from period1b . for period1b we found a novel peak in intron <dig>  we were unable to detect the hres described for leg <dig> and birc <dig> genes. we have not yet checked whether there are “sub-threshold” peaks at their predicted position in our data set.

to evaluate how well our data corresponds with mammalian hre data, we did several comparisons. first we asked whether a set of well-known hif targets had associated peaks in our data. we collated an extensive list of  <dig> targets based on  <cit> . in  <dig> cases we were able to identify a clear orthologue  and in  <dig> of  <dig> orthologues  a peak could be identified within the orthologous gene, or the 15kb surrounding genomic sequence. for a random set of  <dig> genes this was  <dig> , showing significant enrichment .

secondly, for  <dig> well-known human hif targets with experimentally characterised hif-binding sites, we compared the position of the known hif-binding site to our peaks. we estimated that in roughly 7– <dig> out of  <dig> genes, peaks were identified in comparable places near zebrafish orthologues . often, we identified further peaks that were not described. we also compared our data with a human chip seq dataset  <cit> . this study identified the largest number of hif-binding sites until now . we analysed more than  <dig> of their top peaks and analysed whether peaks occurred in similar positions in our study. we only selected peaks that fell within those genes, or <10kb from tss/3′utr. in 15/ <dig> cases similarly positioned peaks were noted . sequence comparison of  <dig> such coinciding peaks in fish and human, failed to uncover significant sequence homologies.

finally, we used the great website  <cit>  to select all peaks from schödel et al., that fall within the tss ± 1kb from a gene and identified  <dig> genes. of these,  <dig> had zebrafish orthologues. using our chip-seq data, great identified  <dig> peak associated genes from  <dig> genes with the same characteristics. when the peak associated genes from schödel et al., were compared with our peak associated genes; out of  <dig> genes,  <dig> fell within the set of  <dig> , which represents a significant enrichment  when hypergeometric analysis was performed.

in the zebrafish pfkfb <dig> gene, an unusual pattern of peaks was found. pfkfb <dig> is an important regulator of glycolytic flux and part of a family of  <dig> pfkfb genes in mammals that probably arose through genome duplications, as primitive chordates and drosophila only contain a single pfkfb gene. surprisingly, nine peaks were identified near pfkfb <dig>  this gene was the only gene in the genome where we found multiple peaks located in the middle of exons:  <dig> in coding exons and one in the 3′utr. the peaks in coding exon  <dig> and the 3′utr had a  hif-binding sequence “cacgtg” near the summit. the exon  <dig> peak was also found in our wild-type sample . we explored how the hif binding site in exon  <dig> evolved. in this unique situation flanking coding sequence conservation can help to follow the binding site over long evolutionary distances. in human, both pfkfb <dig> and pfkfb <dig> are regulated by hypoxia and both contain the cacgtg sequence. zebrafish pfkfb4a/b lack the cacgtg sequence, and, as predicted, do not show exonic chip-seq peaks. other pfkfb orthologues in zebrafish lack the cacgtg sequence and also lack chip-seq peaks in exon  <dig> . in human, pfkfb <dig> and pfkfb <dig> also lack the sequence. this element has most likely arisen during early vertebrate evolution, it can first be recognised in a jawless vertebrate, pteromyzon marinum , but not in more primitive chordates or drosophila.

discussion
here we describe the use of chip coupled to next-generation high-throughput sequencing to identify hif-1α binding sites throughout the zebrafish genome in the vhl mutant. chip allows unbiased genome-wide coverage of the zebrafish genome to identify hif-1α binding sites, enabling development of zebrafish as an emergent model organism for research into the hypoxic response in a physiological context  <cit> . the use of the vhl mutant, a zebrafish model for hypoxia, has allowed us to compare hif-1α binding sites with gene expression changes seen in this mutant.

microarray analysis of gene expression changes in vhl mutants compared against wild-type controls produced both expected and unexpected results. the up-regulated genes included many classical hypoxia response genes that are associated with loss of vhl in mammalian cell lines . this reinforces the idea that the hypoxic response is activated in the vhl mutant. contrary to this, we see similar numbers of down-regulated genes. currently, there is little evidence in the literature for hif to act as transcriptional repressor. however, pvhl is thought to have both hif-dependent and hif–independent functions  <cit> . the latter include; extracellular matrix deposition  <cit> , cell senescence  <cit> , apoptosis  <cit>  and microtubule stabilisation and regulation of the primary cilia  <cit> . it is not inconceivable that loss of vhl’s hif-independent functions may lead to a significant number of both up- and down-stream transcriptional changes. furthermore, these transcriptional changes may be complicated by the use of a whole organism model. vhl mutants have had activation of the hypoxic response over a period of several days, leading to additional transcriptional changes which would not be identified in cell-culture models, using more acute stimulation. interestingly, we see that of these down-regulated genes,  <dig> are predicted to be involved in ‘lipid biosynthetic processing’ by david . this finding is of interest as hif- <dig> activation was reported to affect lipid metabolism in hepatocytes causing a decrease in lipogenic gene expression and on a physiological level, leading to hepatic steatosis in liver-specific hif-2α mutant mice  <cit> . although the histology of the liver has not been reported in vhl mutant zebrafish, evidence of increased lipid storage has been detected in the pronephric tubules of vhl mutant embryos  <cit> . the effects of hypoxia on lipid processing have not been well studied, and strong representation of genes related to this process in the vhl mutant, in our view, warrants further study. this highlights an important consequence of using whole zebrafish to study the effects of hypoxia. the presence of a variety of cells, tissues and organs in a whole animal may on the one hand complicate analysis, however, for the same reasons novel, more tissue-specific hif targets can be found. in addition, targets might be found whose expression is modulated indirectly, as a result of signalling between tissues in the intact organism.

to locate hif-1α binding sites we first identified the most highly represented motif found within the peaks seen in vhl mutants. an rcgtg  motif that is identical to the consensus motif identified in human hypoxia response genes was found using genome-wide chip approaches   <cit> . additionally, it is highly similar to the hre identified from the hif binding regions of epo in another fish species takifugu rubripes  <cit> . this is both reassuring and unsurprising as the hif pathway is strongly conserved throughout the phylogeny  <cit> .

our experiments identified  <dig> candidate hif binding loci and possibly up to  <dig> sites, a greater number of loci than might have been expected, as previous studies have identified approximately  <dig> hif-1α binding loci in human cells  <cit> . despite this, we are confident that our  <dig> sites are due to hif-1α binding. firstly, the majority were not identified in wt animals where nuclear hif-1a levels are expected to be very low, thus they are unlikely to pulled down due to spurious interactions of the antiserum and unrelated dna binding proteins. secondly, they contain the highly conserved rcgtg in close proximity to the peak summit . we interpret this as a strong indicator that these hre-containing peaks are due to hif-1α binding.

it is notable that  <dig> of the peaks we found do not contain rcgtg motifs in the surrounding  <dig> bp, the relevance of these peaks is currently unknown. we investigated whether these non-hre peaks were due to non-specific binding of the anti-hif-1α antibody, this was achieved by examining the overlap between these peaks with all the peaks found in wild-type embryos . we found that, although  <dig> of the  <dig> peaks found in vhl mutants overlapped > <dig> % with the wild-type peaks , the vast majority of these peaks did not overlap. we reason that if the anti-hif-1α antibody is binding non-specific dna-interacting targets, then this would lead to non-hre containing chip peaks. however, we would also predict that many of these peaks would be shared between wild-type and vhl samples. as we find this is not the case for the majority of chip peaks, and that meme analysis did not detect any other motifs, we suggest that there may be other explanations for the non-hre peaks. these could represent hif binding to off-centre hres or indirect binding via other dna binding proteins or alternatively, these peaks may contain hres that do not conform to the rcgtg consensus. we were interested if there were indications that these non-hre peaks may represent hif-1α binding leading to changes in gene expression. using great, we compared the distribution of non-hre peaks with that of hre-peaks and found a very similar pattern. although this association does not prove the functional importance of these non-hre peaks, it suggests that they may have a role in regulating transcription.

although we do not have functional data to draw direct links between hif-1α dna binding and transcriptional activation we were interested to see if hif-1α peaks in the tss correlated well with gene expression changes in vhl mutants. in vhl mutants, we found that of the  <dig> up-regulated genes,  <dig> had hif-1α peaks in their tss regions whilst of the  <dig> down-regulated,  <dig> had hif-1α peaks in their tss regions. although we found some hif-1α peaks associated with down-regulation of gene expression, we found a much larger proportion associated with transcriptional activation. when we performed hypergeometric analysis of these data sets, we found that the correlation between up-regulated genes and hif-1α binding peaks was significant , whilst it was not for down-regulated peaks . this is broadly in agreement with the consensus in the literature, that hif-1α is not thought to directly regulate transcriptional repression  <cit> , but functional experiments to investigate the possibility direct hif-1α mediated repression of gene expression would be of interest. it should however also be noted that many of the genes up-regulated in vhl microarrays did not have hre’s in their tss regions. it is as yet unclear as to why this is exactly. importantly, our analysis of the relationship between hif-1α binding and gene expression has focused on peaks that fall within the tss, however, many peaks are found outside the tss and promoter regions , which is in agreement with the situation in human  <cit> . unfortunately these peaks are very difficult to assign reliably to genes, as distance to the tss can be misleading to detect functional enhancers. in addition, as hif is a master regulator and activates other signalling pathways  and transcription factors, indirect targets are undoubtedly present in the microarray.

our study found a much higher number of significant peaks in vhl mutant zebrafish than have previously been found in cell culture studies where physical hypoxia or dmog have been used to stimulate the hif response  <cit> . indeed, we find a considerably higher number of significant peaks containing the rcgtg motif than we find up-regulated genes. this begs the question: why are there so many more peaks found using the vhl mutant zebrafish than hypoxically stimulated cells? a number of explanations are conceivable. firstly, the embryos we used at 4dpf and have been stimulated for a longer time than the cells used by schödel et al., who expose them for  <dig> h, this could lead to greater accumulation of hif-1α  <cit> . secondly, the vhl zebrafish contains a wide array of cells and tissues which may have different hif-1α dna binding profiles, thus leading to a greater number of peaks than would be found from just one cell-type. finally, we have used a genetic method to stimulate the hif pathway, which blocks the degradation of hif. we speculate that this leads to a glut of hif-1α accumulating in the nucleus, and thus promoting more binding than would be seen by physiological activation  <cit> . in order to ascertain whether individual peaks are functional, further work is needed.

our data can be used confirm known and identify novel potential hif regulated genes, including, for example, mirnas. some examples of this are given in additional file  <dig>  in zebrafish hif-target genes, we can predict where hre are located to guide further experiments. in addition, we see some conservation of where hre peaks are located when compared to human, so our data may also guide hre discovery in mammals. for example, we predict an important hre to be present in exon  <dig> of the human pfkfb <dig> and pfkfb <dig> genes.

CONCLUSIONS
here we present transcriptional analysis of the vhl mutant with respect to hif-1α as a known regulator of the hypoxic response. we found that, unlike some cellular models, which use physical hypoxia or pharmaceutical stimulation to inhibit the phd’s, genetic inactivation of vhl led to both positive and negative transcriptional changes. this may be due to disruption of vhl’s hif-independent roles, or alternatively this may be due to studying the effects of activation of genetically induced hypoxia in a whole organism. chip-seq for hif-1α in vhl mutants found a great number of peaks and from these the canonical hre was identified. we found more hre-containing peaks than transcriptionally activated genes, suggesting that hif-1α binding may not be sufficient for transcriptional activation. some chip peaks did not contain a hre, although they do not appear to be due to non-specific binding of the anti-hif-1α antibody and some are found within the tss regions of transcriptionally active genes suggesting that they may have some functional relevance. we hope that these data can be used to aid further investigation into the hif transcriptional response and the development of the zebrafish as a model for research into the hypoxic response.
