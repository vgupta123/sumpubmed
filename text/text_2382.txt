BACKGROUND
the highly conserved eto  corepressor gene family traced to drosophila eto homologue nervy  <cit>  contains the myeloid translocation gene   <dig>   or murine eto- <dig> , mtg <dig>  and mtg-related protein  <dig>  . the eto homologues do not bind directly to dna but rather function as protein scaffolds and bring about gene repression indirectly through an interplay with multiple transcriptional regulatory proteins  <cit> . mtg <dig> has been shown to interact with canonical transcription factors such as plzf, bcl <dig>  tal1/scl, gfi1and heb  <cit> , and mtgr <dig> with tal1/scl  <cit> . the eto homologues also recruite chromatin regulating proteins such as nuclear corepressors  <cit>  and histone deacetylases  that catalyze chromatin modifications, resulting in transcriptional repression. importantly, eto homologue genes are involved in chromosomal translocations of acute leukemia, mtg <dig> in the generation of the aml1- mtg <dig> fusion gene of t  <cit>  in patients with therapy-induced leukemia, eto in the generation of the aml1-eto fusion gene of t  <cit>  and mtgr <dig> in the generation of aml1-mtgr <dig> fusion gene of t  <cit> . the leukemic fusion proteins so encoded disrupt normal function of transcriptional regulators, to promote dysregulation of hematopoietic cell differentiation  <cit> .

expression of the mtg <dig>  corepressor is confined to early hematopoiesis whereas mtgr <dig> is present throughout hematopoietic maturation  <cit> . thus, eto- <dig> increases during differentiation of murine embryonic stem cells into hematopoietic cells  <cit>  suggesting a role in the development of the blood cell compartment. this is consistent with mtg <dig> being the most highly expressed eto homologue gene in the stem/progenitor cell compartment  <cit> . furthermore, mtg16/eto- <dig> has a role in controlling erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. in this context, mtg16/eto- <dig> is incorporated in ldb <dig>  and tal <dig>  containing transcription factor complexes  <cit> , mediating transcriptional suppression. as a heteromer with mtg <dig>  also mtgr <dig> complexes with tal <dig> in erythroid cells, enhancing transcriptional repression  <cit> . the eto- <dig> recruitment within nuclear complexes may determine the onset of terminal erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation  <cit> , while the downmodulation of mtg16/eto- <dig> at late stages of erythropoiesis suggests that decreased transcriptional repression is necessary for late, terminal erythroid differentiation to occur. for example, in erythroid mel cells, induction of differentiation is accompanied by dissociation of nuclear protein complexes concomitant with a decrease in the relative level of eto- <dig>  <cit> . moreover, shedding the negative regulator eto- <dig>  <cit>  transforms the ldb complex into a positive regulator of final erythroid differentiation, supporting the notion that multi-protein complexes may keep erythroid target genes suppressed until corepressor eto- <dig> is eliminated at final differentiation  <cit> . similarly, in megakaryopoiesis the eto- <dig> expression is restricted to immature cells consonant with a function in repression of genes that should be only terminally expressed  <cit> . finally, a physiological hematopoietic role for mtg <dig> has been proven by results from targeted disruption of murine mtg <dig>   <cit> . although no complete block in hematopoietic differentiation was discovered by eto- <dig> knockout, a requirement was demonstrated for eto- <dig> in fate decisions, proliferation and stress- dependent hematopoiesis. as a corroboration of functional differences between eto homologues, targeted disruption of mtgr <dig> showed no phenotypic consequences for hematopoiesis  <cit> .

endogenous cell-type-specific hematopoietic expression of the eto homologues  <cit>  suggests differences in gene regulation. the eto promoter is regulated by the gata transcription factor in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells  <cit> . we now examined functional promoter elements upstream of the coding sequences for mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig>  a critical role in transcriptional regulation was shown for an evolutionary conserved gata binding site of the mtg <dig> promoter. in contrast, mtgr <dig> has a strong tata-less promoter with multiple gc box-rich regions of possible importance for constitutive expression. our results show that the eto homologue promoters are regulated differently, consistent with cell-type- specific expression.

RESULTS
identification of transcriptional start site and sequence analysis of proximal promoters of mtg <dig> and mtgr1
the mtg <dig> corepressor is associated with developing hematopoiesis and control of erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis. however, transcriptional factors regulating the expression of the mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> genes have not been identified. therefore, we tried to discover the important cis-acting regions and trans-acting factors regulating expression in hematopoietic cells. first, to find the position of the transcriptional start site for mtg <dig>  we performed 5'- rapid amplification of cdna-ends . mtg16-cdna amplified from erythropoietic hel cell mrna showed a complete sequence match with a region of mtg16a transcript . the transcription start site  was determined at - <dig> bp upstream of the translation start codon atg at + <dig> . the translation initiation in mtg16b is located further downstream to that of mtg16a as determined by alignment of mrna sequence of mtg16a  and mtg16b . inspection of the proximal promoter upstream of the transcription start site start  revealed several consensus binding elements  such as potential ets <dig> binding sites at - <dig> and at -419; sp <dig> binding sites at - <dig> and at -316; gata binding sites at - <dig> and at -301; mzf <dig> sites at - <dig> and at -191; tfap2a at - <dig> . no canonical tata or ccaat boxes were detected in the region near the transcription start.

however, a conserved gc box close to the transcriptional start site  may regulate transcriptional initiation. sequence comparisons showed the gata binding site at - <dig> to be conserved between eight species .

the transcription start site for the mtgr <dig> gene  is present at - <dig> bp upstream of the translation start codon  <cit> . as for mtg <dig>  the proximal promoter of mtgr <dig> lacks canonical tata and ccaat boxes. however, the region between - <dig> to - <dig> bp contains multiple gc motifs showing strong homology with the classical gc box, 5ggggcgggg3' . these boxes are predicted to compose multiple binding sites for sp <dig>  in addition, ets <dig> sites are noted at - <dig> and - <dig> as well as a yy <dig> potential binding sites at - <dig> bp. the different composition of the proximal promoters of mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> suggests that they are under distinct regulatory mechanisms. while the promoters of both genes lack classical tata or ccaat boxes, the presence in the mtgr <dig> promoter of multiple sp <dig> sites and a cpg island from - <dig> to - <dig> bp covering the transcriptional start site  indicate characteristics of a housekeeping gene.

functional evaluation of mtg <dig> promoter
we cloned a - <dig> to - <dig> bp region  of the sequence upstream of the transcription start of the mtg <dig> for determination of transcriptional activity. the cloned region was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in promoterless pgl3/basic vector  to give the pgl3/- <dig> to - <dig> plasmid, which was transfected into hematopoietic cell lines and luciferase activity was determined and normalized as described in methods. pgl3/- <dig> to - <dig> showed an approximately 4-fold increased reporter signal as compared to pgl3/sv40-promoter in erythroid hel cells  indicating strong transcriptional activity in cells expressing the endogenous mtg <dig> gene. the mtg <dig> luciferase reporter also showed a strong signal in other erythroid and in megakaryocytic cell lines investigated . however, no direct correlation was observed between luciferase activity and mtg <dig> transcripts in erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines. differences in cellular environment and regulatory elements outside the cloned promoter that modulate endogenous gene expression could explain the lack of direct correlation between promoter activity and gene expression. promyelocytic hl- <dig> and acute myeloid leukemia kasumi- <dig> cells showed only low luciferase activity; lymphoblastoid raji cells and monkey kidney cos cells lacked reporter activity. the latter results correlate with low mtg <dig> transcript levels.

a gata consensus binding site is critical for mtg <dig> promoter function in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells
in order to identify important cis regulatory elements, a series of constructs was produced by sequential deletions from the 5' end of the - <dig> to - <dig> bp region shown in figure  <dig>  the deletion constructs were incorporated upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in promoterless pgl3/basic resulting in the pgl <dig> -820- <dig>  pgl <dig> -668- <dig>  pgl <dig> -512- <dig>  pgl <dig> -359- <dig>  pgl <dig> -339- <dig>  pgl <dig> -299- <dig>  and pgl <dig> -219- <dig> reporter constructs, which were transfected into erythroid hel/tf- <dig>  erythroid/megakaryocytic ut- <dig> and megakaryocytic meg- <dig> cells. deletion of the region from - <dig> to - <dig> did not reduce the transcriptional activity of the promoter, while extended 5'-deletions caused a prominent decrease in luciferase activity . we conclude that the region between - <dig> and - <dig> bp is likely to contain the major regulatory cis-elements of the proximal mtg <dig> promoter, as it was the smallest fragment created with retention of full transcriptional activity .

as noted in figure 1a potential ets <dig>  sp <dig>  gata and mzf <dig> binding sites are detected in the proximal mtg <dig> promoter. we examined whether these binding sites contribute to promoter transactivation using site-directed mutagenesis. most notably, disruption of the gata- <dig> site led to a  <dig> to 10-fold reduction in luciferase reporter gene activity in either hel, tf <dig>  ut- <dig> or meg- <dig> cells relative to intact mtg <dig> promoter  , indicating this gata site as an important cis-factor for mtg <dig> gene expression. furthermore, the gata - <dig> site is highly conserved among species  supporting its functional importance. moreover, gata factors are known to play an important role in erythroid/megakaryocytic differentiation  <cit> . our results suggest that the gata - <dig> site may be involved in transcriptional activation in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells.

the gata- <dig> site is necessary but not sufficient for transactivation of the mtg <dig> promoter as some deletion constructs  that retain the gata - <dig> site do not retain transcriptional activity . however, all mutation experiments were done with the longer - <dig> construct and its promoter activity was blocked completely by mutation of the gata- <dig> site. an element upstream of the gata- <dig> site that cooperates with gata bound to - <dig> might explain our results. however, no such element was identified as disruption of all upstream potential binding sites that were identified e. g. the sp <dig> - <dig>  ets <dig> - <dig>  ets <dig> - <dig>  sp <dig> - <dig>  and gata - <dig> sites did not affect the reporter signal . disruption of the mzf <dig> - <dig> sites downstream of the gata- <dig> site did not affect the luciferase signal either . mutation of the downstream mzf <dig> -  <dig> increased the signal except in hel cells , suggesting that this site possibly mediates binding to some transcriptional repressor.

gata- <dig> binds in vitro/in vivo to the - <dig> consensus site in the mtg <dig> promoter
the finding that destruction of the conserved gata  site reduced gene promoter activity  suggested binding of trans-acting factors. therefore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays  and antibody supershift assays were performed to examine whether the - <dig> site binds gata protein in vitro. a double-stranded biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probe  was prepared for the core consensus gata - <dig> site, the sequence and location of which is shown in figure  <dig>  the oligonucleotide probe was incubated with nuclear extracts prepared from hel, tf- <dig>  ut- <dig> or meg- <dig> cells to examine interactions between probe and proteins in vitro. nuclear extract proteins from all cell types showed a shift, indicating binding of protein to the biotinylated probe . binding was specific, as shown by absence of shift in the presence of excess unlabeled competitor probe. protein bound to the gata- <dig> probe was "super-shifted" by anti-gata- <dig> antibody, but not with control anti-cd <dig> antibody . thus, our results demonstrate that gata- <dig> can bind to the consensus gata-binding site  within the mtg <dig> promoter. no supershift was observed by anti-gata- <dig> antibodies  despite testing of several different antibodies , suggesting lack of strong binding of gata- <dig> to the consensus site. this finding is similar to previous results from the characterization of the eto promoter, in which a gata-site binds gata- <dig> but not gata- <dig>  <cit> .

in addition to the specific shift, another band is clearly visible in the emsa . this band-shift is unspecific since it is unaffected or only weakly affected by the competitor probe. however, it obviously contains gata- <dig> protein as it is lost by supershifting with anti gata- <dig> .

the sp <dig> - <dig> and the mzf <dig> - <dig> binding sites of the mtg <dig> promoter were also examined by emsa. no supershifting was observed by appropriate antibodies suggesting lack of binding of these transcription factors to the respective consensus binding sites .

chromatin immunoprecipitation  was used to determine whether gata-1- <dig> bound to the putative mtg <dig> gene promoter in vivo. the assays were carried out with chromatin isolated from hel, tf- <dig>  ut- <dig> or meg- <dig> cells and antibody towards chromatin-bound gata- <dig> or gata- <dig>  precipitated dna was identified by pcr amplification of the mtg <dig> promoter fragment with gene specific oligonucleotides. by the use of primers specific for the - <dig> to - <dig> region, which flank the conserved gata  site, a  <dig> bp pcr product was generated using precipitation with either anti-gata- <dig> or anti-gata- <dig>  of all the cell lines examined . control precipitation with anti-gata- <dig> or anti-gata- <dig> and amplification of a downstream control region was negative. thus, specific amplification was achieved after precipitation with both anti-gata- <dig> or anti-gata- <dig> 

taken together, the results from emsa/supershift assays demonstrate gata- <dig> binding in vitro to the gata - <dig> binding site and results from chip assays demonstrate binding in vivo of both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> to the putative mtg <dig> promoter. this result further supports a functional role at least for gata- <dig> in activation of the mtg <dig> promoter, consistent with the results of the mutagenesis studies shown in figure  <dig> 

overexpression of gata-1
gata- <dig> was transiently overexpressed to examine its effect on co-transfected mtg <dig> promoter activity in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells. the reporter signal was increased by overexpression in megakaryocytic meg- <dig> cells  . the specificity of this result is supported by lack of impact by gata- <dig> overexpression on the renilla control .

repression of gata- <dig> by sirna and inhibition of gata- <dig> transcriptional activity with herp <dig> leads to decreased mtg <dig> promoter activity
to verify a role of gata- <dig> in mtg <dig> expression, sirna was transfected into hel cells as described in methods. introduction of gata- <dig> sirna led to a decrease by approximately 50% of both gata- <dig> and mtg <dig> mrna levels and the results were confirmed on the protein levels , indicating a role of gata- <dig> in mtg <dig> transcriptional regulation. three different sirna constructs, all bioinformatically  designed to minimize off-target effects were used. however, only one resulted in a robust suppression of gata- <dig> protein. off-target effects can therefore not be excluded. however, in combination with our results from reporter experiments, emsa, chip, and overexpression, we believe that we can draw the conclusion that gata- <dig> is a positive trans-acting factor on the promoter. additional support for a role of gata- <dig> was obtained by use of the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor herp <dig>  which shows physical interaction with gata- <dig> and represses gata-1-mediated transcriptional activation  <cit> . both erythroid and megakaryocytic cell lines cotransfected with herp <dig> showed strong inhibition of the mtg <dig> promoter reporter  consistent with a role of gata- <dig> in transcriptional activation of mtg <dig> 

functional evaluation of the mtgr <dig> promoter
we cloned a - <dig> to + <dig> bp region  for examination of transcriptional activity. the cloned region was inserted upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in promoterless pgl3/basic vector to give the pgl3/- <dig> to + <dig> plasmid, which was transfected into hematopoietic cell lines and luciferase activity was determined and normalized as described in methods. an approximately 2-fold luciferase signal in hel cells, as compared to the positive control pgl3/promoter, indicated strong transcriptional activity of the cloned region . upon transfection of the shortest luciferase construct with full promoter activity   to a panel of hematopoietic cell lines, different activities were revealed . as with the mtg <dig> promoter, the strongest activity was found in hel cells, but the activity patterns between the two promoters were not uniform . the mtgr <dig> promoter construct produced a signal in all cell lines examined except for cos cells. all cell lines examined expressed endogeneous mtgr <dig> mrna supporting ubiquitous expression .

to define the promoter in more detail, a series of constructs was generated by sequential deletions from the 5'end of the - <dig> + <dig> bp region after which transcriptional activity was analyzed in hel cells . deletion to - <dig> did not affect transcriptional activity, but further deletion reduced the luciferase reporter expression. thus the sequence from - <dig> to + <dig> bp retained full transcriptional activity and therefore is likely to contain the core proximal mtgr <dig> promoter. further sequential 5' deletions of the - <dig> to + <dig> bp region resulted in a step by step decreasing luciferase reporter signal  suggesting cooperation between factors binding to different regions of the promoter.

site-directed mutagenesis was used to examine whether potential transcription factor binding sites contributed to promoter transactivation. the - <dig> to + <dig> bp region retains approximately two thirds of the transcriptional activity of the fully active promoter as was shown in figure  <dig>  this region is gc box-rich with  <dig> sp <dig> consensus binding sites  located immediately upstream of the transcription start site at - <dig> bp consistent with the housekeeping gene character of mtgr <dig> with ubiquitous expression. however, disruption of individual sp <dig> sites; sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1- <dig>  sp1-170; did not affect reporter gene activity relative to intact mtgr <dig> promoter , suggesting that sp <dig> is not important for promoter activity. however, it is possible that multiple active sp <dig> binding creates a redundancy in sp <dig> binding and elimination of several sp <dig> binding sites is needed to reveal their functional relevance. disruption of the - <dig> ets <dig>  the - <dig> ets <dig> and the - <dig> yy <dig> sites did also not affect promoter activity . overall, our results indicate that a gc-box-rich sequence with multiple sp <dig> sites is important for transcriptional regulation of mtgr <dig> promoter.

aml1-eto represses mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> gene reporters
the aml1-eto fusion protein, which is a gene product of t of acute leukemia  <cit>  binds the promoter region of many genes causing transcriptional suppression  <cit> . aml1- eto has been shown to suppress an eto promoter reporter in erythroid/megakaryocytic cells  <cit> . therefore, aml1-eto was transiently expressed in hel cells to examine also the effect on co-transfected mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> promoter reporters. in both cases the reporter was strongly repressed in a dose-dependent manner by aml1-eto . this finding is not directly consistent with the inhibition observed in vivo in aml1-eto-positive kasumi cells of only mtg <dig>  but not mtgr <dig> transcripts  suggesting influence of cell-specific contexts.

discussion
the negative transcriptional regulator eto was originally discovered as the 3' participant in the leukemia chromosomal translocation t  <cit> . now, eto and its homologues mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> are known to be involved in transcriptional regulation of genome-wide targets. to explain cell-type-specificity of eto homologue expression and function  <cit>  exploration of promoter regulation is warranted. the human eto proximal promoter is regulated by the gata- <dig> transcription factor in an erythroid/megakaryocytic-specific manner  <cit> . here, we continued to identify essential cis-acting elements and trans-acting factors also of the promoters of mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> within human hematopoietic cells.

mtg <dig> promoter regulation
tata and caat-like promoter motifs facilitate interactions with general transcription factors and are thus involved in initiation of transcription. the proximal mtg <dig> promoter investigated lacks these motifs. gc-boxes are known to regulate the utilization of start sites in tata-less promoters  <cit> . therefore, the conserved gc-box situated close to start site  may be involved in transcriptional initiation. among hematopoietic cell lines, the promoter activity was strongest in the erythroid hel/tf- <dig>  erythroid/megakaryocytic ut- <dig> and megakaryocytic meg- <dig> cells consistent with a role of mtg <dig> in erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis  <cit> . deletion analysis of the proximal mtg <dig> promoter defined a  <dig> bp region upstream of the transcription start to be required for maximal promoter activity. this region includes a potential gata binding site , which is strongly conserved between species. disruption of the gata - <dig> binding site, repressed transactivation of the mtg <dig> promoter. the importance of this cis-acting binding site was confirmed by results from examination in vitro with emsa, which revealed specific gata- <dig> binding. further, in vivo binding of both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> to this region of the promoter was confirmed by chip/pcr analysis. taken together these results demonstrate binding of the gata- <dig> transcription factor to the mtg <dig> promoter and strongly support a role for gata- <dig> in transcriptional regulation of the mtg <dig> gene in hematopoietic cells.

mtgr <dig> promoter regulation
a  <dig> bp region upstream of the translation start site of mtgr <dig> was defined as sufficient for maximal activity in erythroid hel cells. upon analysis using different cell lines, we found that the promoter is active in most of them, which is in agreement with ubiquitous presence of native mtgr <dig> gene product. furthermore, the lack of classical tata or ccaat boxes, the presence of multiple sp <dig> sites and a cpg island covering the transcriptional initiation site of the mtgr <dig> promoter  are similar to characteristics of a housekeeping gene  <cit> , expected to be generally active in a non-tissue specific manner. few potential binding sites for known transcription factors were found in the - <dig> promoter, rather a gc-box-rich sequence stretch with multiple sp <dig> binding sites is a prominent part of the promoter. importantly, the gc-box-rich region was responsible for most of the transcriptional activity. however, we were not able to inhibit promoter activity by the elimination of individual sp <dig> binding sites. possibly, individual sp <dig> binding sites may be equally involved in guaranteeing constitutive mtgr <dig> expression. further 5'deletion of the - <dig> promoter region showed gradually decreasing promoter activity observed upon successive deletions, indicating transcriptional cooperation between promoter sequences consistent with cooperating sp1- binding sites.

eto homologues in hematopoiesis
the regulation of both the eto  <cit>  and the mtg <dig> promoter  by gata- <dig> is consistent with a role of human eto/mtg16-mediated gene suppression at a phase of erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis when gata- <dig> levels are high  <cit> . however, despite shared trans-activation, mtg <dig> and eto are differently expressed in human hematopoiesis  <cit> ; mtg <dig> is downmodulated at late stages of erythropoiesis whereas eto is expressed transiently in  erythropoiesis. therefore, cell-type-specific expression of these eto homologues may be governed also by trans-activating factors other than gata. although both mtg <dig> and eto are expressed in human erythroid cells  <cit>  yet the role of eto in murine erythropoiesis is not yet supported  <cit> .

gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> are expressed reciprocally during development of the erythropoietic lineage, gata- <dig> decrease is followed by gata- <dig> increase  <cit> . gata- <dig> seems to be essential for the development of early and definitive erythropoiesis/megakaryopoiesis and gata- <dig> for terminal erythroid/megakaryocytic maturation  <cit> . the present results are consistent with upregulation of mtg <dig> as a result of rising gata- <dig> levels. furthermore, results from genome-wide analyses  <cit>  are consistent with early gata- <dig> induction of murine eto- <dig> during erythropoiesis. these analyses also showed that most occupied sites are located away from promoters indicating that gata factors may be involved in long- range control by occupancy at non-promoter regions.

our finding of in vitro binding of gata- <dig> but lack of gata- <dig> binding to the gata - <dig> binding site raises questions about the relative importance of gata-1/gata- <dig> in mtg <dig> promoter regulation. gata- <dig> is reported to contribute in hematopoietic stem cell and progenitor survival  <cit>  and gata- <dig> in erythroid cell survival  <cit> . furthermore, genetic complementation studies show that gata- <dig> can replace gata- <dig>  <cit> . a lack of binding in emsa experiments suggests that gata- <dig> may not be a primary transcription factor to initiate nucleation of the transcription complex at the mtg <dig> promoter. possibly, gata- <dig> has a weaker binding affinity than gata- <dig>  however, our finding in chip assay of the binding of both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> to mtg <dig> promoter suggests that gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> cooperate. this is supported by results from in vivo studies by chip-seq with human k <dig> erythroleukemia cells  <cit>  showing chromatin occupancy by both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> at the conserved gata motif corresponding to the - <dig> site of the mtg <dig> promoter. in addition, a role of gata- <dig> in stimulating murine eto- <dig> expression was also suggested  <cit> . thus, gata- <dig> was found to occupy a conserved gata binding site in the murine erythroid g1e cell, which lack gata- <dig> expression; the occupied murine site corresponds to the human - <dig> gata binding site of mtg <dig> promoter. overall, available data suggest a role of both gata- <dig> and gata- <dig> in mtg <dig> promoter activation.

murine mtg <dig>  is involved in erythroid progenitor expansion  <cit> , which is coupled to inhibition of differentiation. this is also the case in megakaryopoiesis where eto <dig> represses inappropriate early expression of terminal genes  <cit>  coupled to restrained differentiation of immature megakaryocytes. mtg <dig> and eto show reciprocal expression during in vitro-induced human erythropoiesis; mtg <dig> decreases and eto increases during the peak of erythropoiesis  <cit> . as both promoters are regulated by gata- <dig>  specific negative autoregulation of mtg <dig>  <cit>  may explain the difference. this is consonant with a role for mtg <dig> in repressing genes associated with terminal erythroid differentiation thereby inhibiting differentiation and a role for eto in repressing genes associated with self-renewal and proliferation thereby supporting erythroid differentiation.

suppression of mtg16/mtgr <dig> promoter by aml1-eto
the leukemic aml1-eto fusion protein  <cit>  binds to the promoter region of a number of genes resulting in transcriptional suppression  <cit> . however, some genes are affected by aml1-eto in an indirect manner and do not bind the fusion protein directly  <cit> . the observed suppression of the mtg <dig> and the mtgr <dig> promoter by aml1-eto is likely to be indirect as binding sites for aml <dig> were not detectable on the promoters. furthermore, a potential mechanism for the mtg <dig> promoter inhibition by aml1-eto would be suppression of gata- <dig> through impaired acetylation  <cit> . suppression of mtg <dig> is consistent with the low mtg <dig> promoter reporter signal observed in aml1-eto-positive kasumi cells, which showed very low mtg <dig> transcripts , whereas mtgr <dig> transcripts were high in this cell line . aml1-eto-mediated suppression of the eto promoter has also been reported  <cit>  and suggested to facilitate the aml1-eto- induced block of erythroid lineage commitment  <cit> . aml1-eto-mediated repression of mtg <dig> may have a similar effect because of blocking mtg16/eto2-mediated erythroid progenitor expansion  <cit> . the repression of all eto homologue genes by aml1-eto may have a general role in inhibition of hematopoietic differentiation in t leukemia.

CONCLUSIONS
this work shows differences in promoter regulation between mtg <dig> and mtgr <dig> that may explain differences in hematopoietic expression of these genes. evolutionary conserved gata binding sites are critical in transcriptional regulation of both mtg <dig>  and eto  <cit>  promoters. the mtgr <dig> promoter has a gc box-rich sequence with multiple sp <dig> binding sites, which may secure transcriptional regulation and ubiquitous expression of this gene.
