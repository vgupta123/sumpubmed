BACKGROUND
leafy spurge  is considered an invasive perennial weed in the upper great plains of north america and has been reported to cause significant economic losses  <cit> . vegetative reproduction from an abundance of underground adventitious buds  and sexual reproduction through seeds allow leafy spurge to persist and spread. dormancy in both buds and seeds is an important survival mechanism for leafy spurge and many other invasive perennial weeds. in leafy spurge, seed dormancy ensures distribution of germination in time and space, whereas bud dormancy inhibits underground adventitious buds from initiating new vegetative growth.

dormancy classifications are different between bud and seed. in seeds, dormancy is defined as a developmental state in which germination fails under favorable environmental conditions  <cit> . seed dormancy is also determined by both morphological and physiological properties . seed dormancy for leafy spurge is classified as physiological dormancy, which varies between populations from little or no dormancy to moderate periods of dormancy  <cit> . physiological dormancy in leafy spurge generally can be released by cold or warm stratification. however, dormant leafy spurge seeds do not germinate at constant temperatures of 20°c or 30°c, but imbibing seeds for 21 days at constant temperature  followed by an alternating temperature  treatment increases germination to over 60% in 10 days  <cit> .

bud dormancy is subdivided into the three well-defined phases of para-, endo-, and eco-dormancy. paradormancy  is growth cessation controlled by physiological factors external to the affected structure, endodormacy  is growth cessation controlled by internal physiological factors, and ecodormancy is growth cessation controlled by external environmental factors  <cit> . paradormancy in leafy spurge inhibits buds from developing into new shoots through signals such as auxin and sugars generated from the actively growing aerial portion of the plant , whereas endodormancy is triggered by cold temperature and short photoperiods in autumn . endodormancy is released, and ecodormancy  is maintained, by extended cold.

seed and bud dormancy appears to involve similar physiological processes as both require abscisic acid  to induce dormancy and gibberellins  to break dormancy, and both accumulate similar reserve proteins and lipids during dormancy  <cit> . chilling has also been reported to break dormancy in seeds and buds of some species  <cit> . it has been suggested that some common mechanisms may regulate both seed and bud dormancy  <cit> . we also hypothesized that common mechanisms likely overlap in regulation of dormancy in buds and seeds of leafy spurge.

although phenotypic analysis of mutants or transgenic plants is a primary strategy to understand the function/role of plant regulators , the strategy is not often suitable for plants difficult to perform these alterations as in the case of leafy spurge. comparative transcriptome analysis on buds and seeds is a good complement and would assist in the identification of conserved cell processes and important expression programs that are difficult to achieve using mutagenesis or transgenic approaches. leafy spurge is a model perennial to investigate both seed and bud dormancy  <cit> , and these investigations have identified a subset of genes involved in regulation of growth and development. thus, in this study, the objectives are to identify commonalities in differentially-expressed genes, common trends in gene expression, and general molecular mechanisms during bud and seed dormancy and its release. identification of common molecular processes regulating dormancy in seeds and buds in leafy spurge should provide new insights about common regulators of dormancy induction and release.

RESULTS
quantitative real time - polymerase chain reaction 
this study compared various phases of dormancy between crown buds  and seeds using physiologically analogous dormancy conditions based on information obtained through previous dormancy studies in leafy spurge buds and seeds. two hundred and one leafy spurge homologs of arabidopsis genes involved in growth, hormone, light, and temperature response/regulation were selected for analysis . gene expression by qrt-pcr was examined using total rna prepared from seed and bud samples. although all  <dig> primer pairs were designed based on sequences obtained from a leafy spurge est-database , the possibility exists for different paralogues and alleles of target genes being amplified by a given primer pair. for this reason, we examined all the amplicons in the form of melting point curves  and visualization by gel electrophoresis  for each of our primer pairs. the results indicated that the majority of these amplicons are unique. among  <dig> genes, only  <dig> showed > one melting point curve . however, our results showed that melting curve analysis alone was insufficient to recognize all specific/nonspecific amplification; for example, cop <dig>  was observed as a single amplicon in agarose gel, but dissociation analysis generated two melting point curves . since other factors such as g/c rich, amplicon misalignment in a/t rich regions, and secondary structure in the amplicon region can cause melting of dna molecules in multiple phases  <cit> , gel visualization of dna bands is needed to accurately diagnose the number and size of amplicons.

interestingly, some of the non-unique amplicons showed a migration in amplicon sizes under different phases of dormancy or in different organs; for example, dreb a-1/dreb1d  was expressed as a single amplicon in all samples except endodormant buds , and atsr <dig>  was expressed as a single amplicon in 1d c and 21d c seeds but as double amplicons in all other samples . therefore even if the multiple products are amplified by a given primer pair, the differential accumulation of transcripts from a given gene family still indicate their response to physiological processes associated with comparable phases of dormancy.

cluster analysis
cluster analysis on the expression profiles of  <dig> genes  indicated that buds and seeds fell into two main groups . one group contained all bud samples ; eco, endo, para, and 2d-growth . the second group contained all seed samples ; 1d c , 21d c + 2d a , and 21d c . even though buds and seeds clustered separately , it is possible that common physiological processes associated with dormancy states exist between them. for example, although 2d-growth and 21d c + 2d a both contained growing meristems, this similarity did not make these two samples cluster together.figure  <dig>

these results suggest that substantial transcriptomic divergence may exist between buds and seeds, which could be due to differences in tissue types or other physiological, developmental, or environmental states. consequently, direct comparison between buds and seeds was difficult. to overcome this barrier, we selected two common baselines to determine trends in differentially-expressed genes and identify common processes between analogous dormancy phases of buds and seeds. the endodormant phase was used as the baseline for buds, whereas 1d c  was used as the baseline for seeds.

the physiological state of 21d c seeds is more analogous to paradormant buds than that of ecodormant buds
seeds incubated for 1 day at the constant temperature of 20°c  will not germinate at optimal growth conditions; however, seeds incubated at a constant temperature of 20°c for 21 days  will germinate when subjected to alternating temperatures of 20:30°c  <cit>  . thus, the physiological state of 21d c seeds could be comparable to paradormant buds if seed germination was inhibited by endosperm-generated signals. in contrast, the physiological state of 21d c seeds could also be comparable to ecodormant buds if seed germination was inhibited by mechanisms such as a requirement for diurnal temperature variation. neither endodormant buds nor 1d c seeds will germinate at optimal growth conditions and, for reasons mentioned above, they were used as common baselines for buds and seeds, respectively. we first determined differentially-regulated genes within buds  and seeds  for the  <dig> genes by qrt-pcr . transcript abundance for  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> genes was significantly different  in ‘para to endo’, ‘eco to endo’, and ‘21d c to 1d c’ comparisons, respectively . common differentially-expressed genes were then identified based on the following comparisons:  paradormant buds vs. growth-competent seeds , and  ecodormant buds vs. growth-competent seeds  .table  <dig>

fold changes for buds were determined by comparing the gene expression of ecodormant buds to endodormant buds , and fold changes for seeds were determined by comparing the gene expression of 21-day c seeds to 1-day c seeds . common genes were then identified between buds and seeds. the arabidopsis information resource  ids represent arabidopsis genes used to annotate homologues of leafy spurge transcripts. unpaired two-sample t-tests were performed; symbol “*” represents genes at a p-value <  <dig> , and “**” represents genes at a p-value <  <dig> .



comparison of transcript expression profiles between ‘para to endo’ buds and ‘21d c to 1d c’ seeds identified  <dig> common differentially-expressed genes . some transcript changes were significant but not large in amplitude. nine of these genes showed the same trend in expression pattern. these  <dig> transcripts are involved in aba biosynthesis , auxin transport or response , ethylene response , carbohydrate/protein degradation , cell cycle , flowering , and stress response . six showed an opposite trend in expression pattern and are involved in cytokinin catabolic process , ga response , ethylene response , phosphorylation , and stress response .

the aba biosynthetic gene aba <dig> was among those showing the same trend in expression pattern. this gene was down-regulated in both paradormant buds and 21d c seeds relative to endodormant buds and 1d c seeds, respectively. aba <dig> encodes zeaxanthin epoxidase which plays a role in the epoxidation of zeaxanthin to antheraxanthin and all-trans-violaxanthin in the aba biosynthetic pathway. aba <dig> expression was significantly lower in the aba deficient mutant  than those in wild-type arabidopsis; in addition, exogenous aba application enhanced the expression of aba <dig> significantly  <cit> . therefore, the down-regulation of aba <dig> could indicate that aba synthesis was lower in paradormant buds and 21d c seeds relative to endodormant buds and 1d c seeds. genes involved in auxin transport  and response  were also down-regulated in paradormant buds and 21d c seeds. abcb <dig> encodes p-glycoprotein  and facilitates the cellular and long-distance transport of auxin  <cit> . both iaa7/axr <dig> and arf <dig> are auxin-responsive genes. in general, the transcription factor arf proteins bind to the promoters of auxin-responsive genes to activate or repress transcription. iaa7/axr <dig> encodes an aux/iaa protein which is a transcriptional regulator that represses transcription controlled by arf  <cit> . the down-regulation of abcb <dig>  iaa7/axr <dig>  and arf <dig> suggested that there may be lower auxin signaling in paradormant buds and 21d c seeds relative to their baseline.

comparison of transcript expression profiles between ‘eco to endo’ buds and ‘21d c to 1d c’ seeds identified  <dig> common differentially-expressed genes . similar to ‘para to endo’ and ‘21d c to 1d c’ comparison, some of their transcript changes were not large in amplitude. among the <dig> common genes, only three showed the same trend in expression pattern. these  <dig> transcripts are involved in aba response , auxin response , and cell cycle . seven showed an opposite trend in expression pattern and are involved in aba response , auxin response or transport , cytokinin catabolic process , and stress response .

the aba responsive gene atem <dig> and auxin responsive gene arf <dig> exhibited a similar down-regulated trend in expression pattern in ecodormant buds and 21d c seeds relative to endodormant buds and 1d c seeds, respectively. atem <dig> is aba-inducible and is expressed primarily in the shoot apical meristem and provascular tissue  <cit> . atem <dig> encodes a group  <dig> lea protein which may contribute to cellular stability within the desiccated seed. the down-regulation of atem <dig> and arf <dig> suggested that there may be lower aba and auxin signaling in ecodormant buds and 21d c seeds. though this may be true for 21d c seeds, such conclusion may not apply to ecodormant buds as other aba responsive  and auxin responsive  genes were slightly up-regulated. overall, based on the number of genes and their trend in gene expression, the physiological state of 21d c seeds is more analogous to paradormant buds than that of ecodormant buds.

growth initiation induced auxin response/transport and cell expansion processes in both buds and seeds
growth-induced buds  were compared with germination-induced seeds  to identify analogous physiological responses during the initial phase of bud and seed growth. we first determined differentially-expressed genes within buds  and seeds  for the  <dig> genes . transcript abundance for  <dig> and  <dig> genes was significantly different  in ‘2d-growth to endo’ and ‘21d c + 2d a to 1d c’ comparisons, respectively . comparison of buds and seeds  identified  <dig> common differentially-expressed genes , of which  <dig> had the same trend in expression. these  <dig> transcripts are involved in auxin transport  and growth . the other  <dig> showed an opposite trend in expression pattern and are involved in auxin transport , cytokinin catabolism , and amino acid biosynthesis .table  <dig>

fold changes for buds were determined by comparing the gene expression of 2d-growth buds to endodormant buds , and fold changes for seeds were determined by comparing the gene expression of 21d c + 2d a seeds to 1d c seeds . common genes were then identified between buds and seeds. the arabidopsis information resource  ids represent arabidopsis genes used to annotate homologues of leafy spurge transcripts. unpaired two-sample t-tests were performed; symbol “*” represents genes at a p-value <  <dig> , and “**” represents genes at a p-value <  <dig> .



transcript of pid and pin <dig> were up-regulated in both 2d-growth buds and 21d c + 2d a seeds relative to endodormant buds and 1d c seeds, respectively. these two genes are involved in asymmetric auxin distribution for the gravitropic response  <cit> . in addition, transcript of exp <dig> was up-regulated in 2d-growth buds and 21d c + 2d a seeds. exp <dig> is involved in the modulation of cell wall extensibility  <cit>  and leaf growth  <cit> . given the roles of pid, pin <dig>  and exp <dig> in various aspects of growth, the up-regulation of these genes, not surprisingly, imply similar processes are involved in initial stages of growth in both buds and seeds.

maf <dig> displayed >10-fold transcript abundance at specific phases of dormancy/growth
genes that had large changes in transcript abundance  may reflect specific roles during various phases of dormancy in buds and seeds. these genes are listed  in additional file 3: table s <dig>  a flowering gene, maf <dig>  was strongly up-regulated  in ecodormant buds relative to endodormant buds , and was undetectable in paradormant and growth-induced buds. in contrast, it was down-regulated  in germinating relative to dormant seeds . in arabidopsis, maf <dig> is down-regulated by long-term cold and is involved in inhibiting flowering by directly repressing the expression of florigen ft  <cit> . however, maf <dig> expression in leafy spurge buds appears opposite based on what is observed for this gene in arabidopsis  <cit> . the fact that maf <dig> expression is down-regulated during seed germination and is down-regulated in growing buds relative to ecodormant buds suggest perhaps that maf <dig> is a negative regulator of growth. in poplar, ft is a positive regulator of growth  <cit>  and in arabidopsis, maf <dig> inhibits ft expression, our observation would be consistence with this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS
we compared transcript profiles in buds and seeds. direct comparisons of qrt-pcr results were impractical due to intrinsic differences between buds and seeds. therefore, we utilized two common baselines, endodormant bud and dormant seed samples, to compare and determine differentially-expressed genes. genes responsive to dormancy states were then identified by comparing those differentially-expressed genes in buds and seeds. this approach helped identify common processes related to similar physiological states in leafy spurge crown buds and seeds. based on the number of common genes identified and those showing the same trend in expression pattern, we conclude that physiological relatedness in some phases of dormancy and growth does exist between buds and seeds. these identified genes can be used as molecular markers for specific dormancy phases in both buds and seeds. transcriptome analysis identified potentially important molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy induction and release. based on the combined results, common molecular mechanisms involved in dormancy transitions of buds and seeds likely involve processes associated with aba and auxin signaling and transport, cell cycle, and ap2/erf transcription factors or their up-stream regulators. however, transcript abundance may not reflect a direct association with protein level and activity. therefore, direct protein or hormone measurement would corroborate current results.
