BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori is a gram-negative human pathogen that colonizes the gastric mucosa of about half of the world population. the majority of carriers develop an asymptomatic chronic gastritis that persists for decades. in up to 20% of the h. pylori-infected people severe diseases are developed such as peptic ulcer, gastric adenocarcinoma, and malt -lymphoma  <cit> . epidemiological studies reveal a high prevalence of h. pylori in malignant gastric diseases. therefore, in  <dig>  the who declared h. pylori as carcinogen of the class i   <cit> . only about 1% of h. pylori-infected humans develop malignant gastric sequelae, thus indicating a multi-factorial process that includes host factors   <cit> , environmental factors   <cit> , and bacterial factors. beside others, two major h. pylori virulence factors intensively studied in this respect are the vacuolating cytotoxin vaca and the cytotoxin-associated antigen caga. after secretion vaca acts as a multifunctional toxin causing alterations in late endosomes and mitochondrial membrane permeability  <cit> . furthermore, vaca inhibits t-cell proliferation via β2-integrins, supporting the chronicity of h. pylori infection  <cit> . caga was just recently shown to be an oncoprotein based on the observation that caga-transgenic mice develop significantly increased neoplasia  <cit> . the caga gene is part of the cag-pathogenicity island , consisting of about  <dig> genes. these genes encode a type iv-secretion system , a needle-like apparatus at the surface of the pathogen translocating the effector protein caga into the host cells. the injected caga protein becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated by the host kinases src and abl  <cit> . the t4ss and caga proteins are involved in numerous signalling cascades associated with cell proliferation, motility, actin cytoskeletal rearrangements, disruption of cell-to-cell junctions, pro-inflammatory responses and suppression of apoptosis  <cit> . thus, it is now clear that the cag-pai encoded virulence apparatus plays a pivotal role in h. pylori pathogenesis.

several animal models were tested for h. pylori colonization, persistence, and pathogenesis. although the frequently used mouse model comes with a large reservoir of genetic tools such as specific transgene and knock-out mouse lines, its major disadvantage should not be neglected, as mice so far cannot persistently be infected with h. pylori type i-strains expressing a functional t4ss. the stability of the cag-pai is lost in mice over time of infection  <cit> . the mongolian gerbil animal model is better mimicking the human situation and is very suitable to investigate the role of the major h. pylori virulence factors on the onset and process of gastric carcinogenesis. in  <dig> watanabe et al. first demonstrated that h. pylori-infected mongolian gerbils develop gastric cancer after  <dig> weeks of infection with a prevalence of 37%  <cit> . this even occurs without adding any co-carcinogens. using the gerbil-adapted h. pylori type i-strain b <dig>  originally isolated from the human stomach of a peptic ulcer patient, several groups showed that this pathogen successfully colonizes the gerbil stomach over time  <cit> . after eight weeks of infection a severe antral and corpus gastritis is induced, followed by a precancerous process of atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia as earlier defined by the pathologist correa  <cit> . less virulent h. pylori-strains with a defective t4ss, so called type ii-strains, do not proceed in a corpus-dominant atrophic gastritis, a risk factor for developing gastric adenocarcinoma. thus, an early inflammation later results in the gastric cancer pathway, which strictly depends on a functional t4ss in the mongolian gerbil model.

h. pylori is known for its remarkably high level of genetic diversity creating a dynamic pool of genetic variants. however, it must also maintain its genomic integrity. kang and blaser  proposed that this pool of genetic variants delivers a sufficient genetic diversity to allow h. pylori to occupy all the potential niches in the stomach   <cit> . the usual diversification mechanism involves a frequent intraspecific recombination  <cit>  and an increased mutation rate  <cit> , but this is actually not enough to explain the extreme genetic diversity of h. pylori. additionally, the large amount of repetitive dna sequences observed in previously available h. pylori genomes, supports this remarkable diversification phenomenon. in particular, homopolymeric nucleotide stretches or di- and oligonucleotide repeat tracts can be phase variable expressed by the regulatory mechanism of slipped strand mispairing   <cit> . non-random distribution of long regions of nucleotide identity thousands of base pairs apart  may serve to enhance programmed rearrangements and genetic diversity in h. pylori, which appears to be a highly conserved mechanism in prokaryotes  <cit> .

the comb-system, a modified t4ss, enables h. pylori to take up exogenous dna by natural competence. this allows such dna to be incorporated into the genome through homologous recombination  <cit> . since in many cases the human stomach is colonized with several different h. pylori-strains, a potential recombination within all individuals of this species might allow a panmictic population structure  <cit> . however, despite extensive microdiversity, h. pylori strains are fundamentally similar to each other in overall gene content and organization. applying molecular typing techniques like the multilocus sequence typing , using the polymorphisms of seven housekeeping genes, it was shown that genetic similarity is conserved in h. pylori strains from distinct geographical regions  <cit> . the migration of nations as well as the slave trade between africa and america is consistent with the prevalence of h. pylori populations distributed within these humans  <cit> .

h. pylori was the first species of which two complete genomes were sequenced  <cit> . these were subject to a comparative analysis elucidating the molecular mechanisms regarding the pathogenicity and virulence of bacteria originating from patients with different gastrointestinal diseases .

both genomes contain about  <dig>  mbp. pairs of ortologuous genes show a sequence identity of about 93% on the nucleotide level, and several inversions and transpositions become apparent when comparing the entire genomes. the two genomes have about  <dig>  core genes in common, while 7% of the coding sequences are strain-specific, mainly located on hypervariable regions, called plasticity zones   <cit> . up until now, another seven fully sequenced and annotated genomes of h. pylori-strains hpag <dig>  <cit> , shi <dig>  <cit> , g <dig>  <cit> , hpkx_438_ag0c <dig> and hpkx_438_ca4c <dig>  <cit>  as well as p <dig>  and hpb <dig>  became available for further comparative analyses.

recently, another two h. pylori strains isolated from patients with gastric cancer  and from patients with gastric ulcer  were sequenced and their  <dig> and  <dig> supercontigs, respectively, were compared for identifying strain-specific genes  <cit> . h. pylori b <dig> is the parental strain that was subsequently gerbil-adapted. here we present the whole genome analysis of the gerbil-adapted h. pylori strain b <dig> that originates from h. pylori strain b <dig>  but was adapted to mongolian gerbils by several subculturing steps and stomach passages of up to four weeks. this gerbil-adapted strain b <dig> is a typical type i-strain able to induce severe gastritis as well as gastroduodenal sequelae over time  <cit> .

at first, we considered some basic features of the genome of h. pylori strain b <dig>  including an analysis of the repeats. second, we looked at the similarities and differences of the genome sequences and proteomes of strain b <dig> and b <dig>  paying special attention to the missing and incomplete coding sequences due to the fact that the genome sequence of the h. pylori strain b <dig> is not closed yet. third, we compared the whole genome of strain b <dig> with other fully sequenced h. pylori strains. although the other strains are not directly related to strain b <dig>  it is interesting to compare the new whole genome sequence of h. pylori strain b <dig> to other completely sequenced and well-annotated strains, to study the genetic diversity of h. pylori. finally, we attempted to identify candidates for strain-specific coding sequences that may be associated with the adaptation of strain b <dig> to the stomach of the mongolian gerbil.

RESULTS
general features of the genome of h. pylori strain b8
the whole-genome sequencing of helicobacter pylori strain b <dig> was done by a combination of sanger sequencing  and pyrosequencing technologies . the remaining gaps were closed by pcr and combinatorial multiplex pcr on isolated genomic dna as well as by primer walking on recombinant plasmids. we also applied sanger technology for resequencing all length variable genes, which in turn improved the sequence quality. all in all, our approach resulted in a continuous high quality sequence. the genome of strain b <dig> was deposited in ddbj/embl/genbank on december  <dig>   <dig> and has accession number fn <dig>  the plasmid of strain b <dig> was deposited in ddbj/embl/genbank on january  <dig>   <dig> and has accession number fn <dig> 

the genome of strain b <dig> consists of a circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with a gc content of  <dig> % and  <dig>  coding sequences, of which  <dig>  are functionally annotated . there are  <dig> conserved hypothetical genes in strain b <dig>  the circular genome was split such that the oric starts at the first position of the genome . the genome comes with a plasmid, named phpb <dig>  consisting of  <dig>  bp with a gc content of  <dig> % and nine coding sequences, five of which are functionally annotated.

analysis of repeats in the complete genome of strain b8
repeats can occur in a coding sequence  or in form of duplicated genes  or duplicated sequence regions somewhere in the genome. there are  <dig> repeats with a length of at least  <dig> bp and at least 80% sequence identity . the repeats have lengths of up to  <dig>  bp, and  <dig> of the  <dig> repeats are inverted repeats for which the second instance of the repeat occurs on the reverse strand. especially the virb-genes show homology in different repeat regions, e.g. they are located on the cag-pai and the plasticity zone  of strain b <dig>  furthermore, restriction endonuclease genes are located at different loci on the genome.

in particular, all repeats of minimum length  <dig> with at least 80% sequence identity are shown. the length and the position of the first and second instance of the repeat are shown in column  <dig> and  <dig> and in column  <dig> and  <dig>  the strand of the repeat is given in column  <dig>  column  <dig> shows the number of differences  in an optimal alignment of the two repeat instances. column  <dig> shows the e-value of the repeat and column  <dig> the sequence identity. the two bullets mark the repeats also occurring in all four h. pylori reference strains  <dig>  j <dig>  hpag <dig>  and p <dig> 

altogether,  <dig> % of the whole genome of strain b <dig> is covered by repeated sequences. this repeat density is similar for three of the genomes of the other h. pylori strains: using the same parameters as above, one obtains a repeat density of  <dig> % for strain j <dig> ,  <dig> % for strain hpag <dig> , and  <dig> % for strain p <dig> . only strain  <dig> has a remarkably higher repeat density of  <dig> % . while h. pylori is considered to be a very repetitive bacterial species  <cit> , the repeat densities of the different strains are not remarkably high when compared to all other bacterial genomes: the distribution of repeat densities over  <dig>  bacterial genomes achieves a median of  <dig> % and an average of  <dig> % . for example, there are  <dig> bacterial genomes with a repeat density of more than  <dig> %.

to find common repeats, a blastn comparison of the repeats of the five h. pylori strains b <dig>   <dig>  j <dig>  hpag <dig>  and p <dig> was performed. we consider a repeat to occur in another genome if there is an 80/ <dig> blastn hit of this repeat to any repeat in the set of repeats of this genome. we say that there is an 80/ <dig> blastn hit between two repeats if there is a blastn between any of the four pairs of repeat instances from the two repeats which has at least 80% sequence identity and covers at least 80% of both instances. strain b <dig> contains  <dig> repeats occurring in any of the other h. pylori strains. more specifically, there are  <dig> repeats occurring in only one other strain, eight occurring in two other strains, two occurring in three other strains, and two occurring in all other strains. interestingly, these last two repeats  are very long repeats of  <dig>  and  <dig>  bp, respectively. the left instance of the  <dig>  bp repeat partly overlaps with gene hpb8_ <dig> and the 16s rrna hpb <dig> r <dig>  while the right instance occurs in a region with no functional element. both instances of the  <dig>  bp repeat contain the coding sequence for the outer membrane protein omp <dig>  this is only annotated as such in one instance in strain  <dig>  but not in the other three strains. strain b <dig> has  <dig> repeats occurring in strain  <dig>   <dig> repeats occurring in strain j <dig>   <dig> repeats occurring in strain hpag <dig>  and  <dig> repeats occurring in strain p <dig> 

comparative analysis of the coding sequences of strains b <dig> and b128
to identify genes involved in gerbil-adaptation, a comparative genome analysis of strain b <dig> with the original strain b <dig> was conducted. the available sequence of strain b <dig> consists of  <dig> supercontigs. all supercontigs were mapped to the whole genome of strain b <dig>  additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> lists the specific positions and the quality of the mapping. all supercontigs can be mapped to the genome of strain b <dig>  in total, about 98% of the whole genome sequence of strain b <dig> is covered by b128-supercontigs. due to some overlaps  of the mapped supercontigs , seven of these may be fused resulting in  <dig> b128-supercontigs. the resulting  <dig> gaps are between  <dig> and  <dig>  bp long.

for further analysis, e.g. identification of specific gerbil-adapted genes, a list of genes of strain b <dig> not completely covered by b128-supercontigs was compiled . this list allows to identify "weak" b8-singletons, i.e. genes which have the singleton-property due to the fact that the genome of strain b <dig> has gaps. our comparison is based on 80/ <dig> blastp hits, i.e. blastp hit of at least 80% sequence identity covering at least 80% of the protein sequence. a gene is regarded as a singleton if there is no 80/ <dig> blastp hit of the protein sequence in the set of all proteins of the reference genomes. the set of genes of a reference strain with an 80/ <dig> blastp hit in every other strain is referred to as the core genome.

all b8-singletons appearing completely within the covered regions of strain b <dig> are called "strong" b8-singletons. the uncovered regions of strain b <dig> contain  <dig> kbp and include  <dig> genes.  <dig> of these genes completely occur with at most 2% differences  somewhere else in the b128-supercontigs, or there is an 80/ <dig> blastn hit, i.e. a blastn hit of at least 80% sequence identity covering at least 80% of the length of the coding sequence. this and the large amount of repeats suggest a possible reason why the gaps in the genome of strain b <dig>  were not closed: the 454-reads may have been too short to give enough evidence for assembling regions containing duplicated genes or repeated regions in the genome of strain b <dig> 

further comparative analysis of the genome of strain b <dig> with b <dig> reveals that altogether there are  <dig>  of  <dig>  coding sequences  of strain b <dig> matching completely with at most 2% differences to the b128-supercontigs. that is, there is an alignment of the complete coding sequence  and a substring of the b128-supercontigs with at most 2% differences. the percentage refers to the length of the coding sequence. table  <dig> lists the distribution of the difference values in the best complete matches  of each coding sequence to the b128-supercontigs. for example, there are  <dig>  coding sequences in strain b <dig> matching exactly ,  <dig> coding sequences matching with one difference, and thus  <dig>  coding sequences matching with at most one difference.

the second column shows the number of sequences matching the number of differences. the third column accumulates the numbers of the second column.

comparative genome analysis of the proteome of strains b <dig> and b128
comparing the b8-proteome to the b128-proteome reveals that there are  <dig> amino acid sequences in strain b <dig> such that there is no 80/ <dig> blastp hit in the b128-proteome, see additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  row marked by a bullet. among these singletons there are  <dig> singletons , for which the corresponding coding sequence has a complete match with at most 2% differences in the b128-supercontigs, see additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> for a complete list. from these numbers one concludes that for many genes the dna sequence is present in the b128-supercontigs, but the corresponding gene has not sufficiently been annotated in strain b <dig>  the remaining  <dig> singletons of  <dig> protein sequences are given in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig>  out of the  <dig> singletons,  <dig> are completely or partly located in the regions not covered by the b128-supercontigs and therefore have to be regarded as "weak"  singletons . the remaining  <dig> "strong"  singletons are listed in table  <dig>  additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> gives the numbers of singletons obtained when varying the minimum required sequence identity and coverage of the blastp hits in the range from 70-100%. the ratio of the number of singletons and the number of coding sequences was comparable over the whole range, indicating a similar quality of the nucleotide sequence.

the last two columns show the locus tags of all genes in strain j <dig> and strain  <dig> which are ortholog to the given gene of strain b <dig> 

there are  <dig> coding sequences in strain b <dig> such that the corresponding proteins do not have an 80/ <dig> blastp hit in the b8-proteome . most of these b128-proteins are classified as singletons due to genetic phase variation, e.g. earlier or later stop codon. in general, these b8- and b128-singletons are of interest in analyzing the gerbil-adaptation process leading from strain b <dig> to strain b <dig> .

a comparison of the complete cag-pai of the strains b <dig> and b <dig> was not possible because the b128-sequence has several gaps in the cag-pai region. nevertheless, it was possible to compare the two major virulence factors caga and vaca of the two strains. both factors show 100% identity on nucleotide and protein level.

comparison of the genomes of strain b <dig> and other h. pylori strains
the chromosome of strain b <dig>  is longer than the chromosomes of strains  <dig> , j <dig> , hpag <dig> , and p <dig> . strain b <dig> has  <dig>  coding sequences with an average size of  <dig> bp, see table  <dig>  the average size is smaller than in the other strains. the phase variation of genes is one reason for the high genetic diversity observed in the available h. pylori genomes  <cit> . this is represented in the small average size but large number of genes in strain b <dig>  in total, we found  <dig> genes  of strain b <dig> with a length variation mainly due to gene fragmentation . furthermore, the density of the coding sequences in strain b <dig> is still relatively high:  <dig> % of the chromosome is covered by coding sequences. this is higher than the coding density for strain  <dig> , for strain j <dig>  and for strain p <dig> . only strain hpag <dig> has a slightly higher coding density .

singletons of strain b8
to identify strain-specific genes  we used the software tool edgar  <cit> , whose comparison model is based on pairwise comparisons of protein sequences using blastp  <cit> .

a comparison of the chromosomes of strains  <dig>  j <dig>  hpag <dig>  p <dig>  and b <dig> gives a core genome of  <dig>  genes.  <dig> coding sequences of strain b <dig> are strain-specific . of these,  <dig> are functionally annotated,  <dig> are conserved hypothetical, and  <dig> are hypothetical genes.  <dig> singletons are located in the pz of strain b <dig>  interestingly, the other four strains have considerably less singletons: strain hpag <dig> has  <dig> singletons, strain j <dig> has  <dig> singletons, strain  <dig> has  <dig> singletons, and strain p <dig> has  <dig> singletons. the larger number may be due to the fact that strain b <dig> is adapted to the mongolian gerbil while the others are not. in contrast, when using less strict blastp hits with minimum bit score of  <dig>  one obtains  <dig> singletons.

among the  <dig> strain-specific coding sequences,  <dig> are functionally annotated. interestingly, the typical genes related to dna modification e.g. dna methylases  and restriction endonucleases  are present in the genome of strain b <dig> . furthermore, we found two genes coding for proteins enabling dna transfer , a putative transposase , and two cdp hydrolases .

we analyzed the singletons of strain b <dig> according to the pathogenicity of the strains. to do so, we compared the whole genome of strain b <dig> with the genomes of the duodenal ulcer strains j <dig> and p <dig> as well as the gastritis strains  <dig> and hpag <dig>  in the case of the duodenal ulcer strains and gastritis strains we obtained  <dig> and  <dig> singletons of strain b <dig> in addition to the  <dig> singletons, respectively . a remarkably high number of singletons of the comparison to the gastritis strains belong to the group of t4ss proteins . these are located within the tfs <dig> on the pz <dig> of the duodenal ulcer strain p <dig> and therefore are missing in additional file  <dig>  table s <dig> 

description of the plasticity zone of strain b8
the plasticity zone of strain b <dig> is located between position  <dig>  and position  <dig> , i.e. it consists of  <dig>  bp . thus it is longer than the pzs of each of the genomes strain  <dig>  j <dig>  hpag <dig>  and p <dig>  the pz of strain b <dig> contains  <dig> coding sequences , see table  <dig>  it has a lower gc-content  than the overall genome. for the h. pylori strains  <dig> and j <dig> it was previously shown that the pzs are flanked by the ftsz-gene and the 5s-/23s-rrna gene pair  <cit> . this also holds for strain b <dig>  where the ftsz-gene has the locus tag hpb8_ <dig>  in the pz of strain b <dig> typical genes are present :  topa  encoding a dna topoisomerase i,  a conserved hypothetical protein  containing a vird <dig> relaxase domain,  para  encoding a putative chromosome partitioning protein,  orfq  containing domains characteristic for dna methylases and helicases  <cit> , and  the integrase/recombinase coding gene xerd . the pz of strain b <dig> also contains a transposable element ishp <dig> from position  <dig>  to  <dig> . the type iv-secretion system tfs <dig> is located from position  <dig>  to  <dig>  . it is surrounded by a partial tfs <dig> .

in the genome of strain j <dig>  the pz contains two genes jhp <dig> and jhp <dig> that are reported to be associated with gastric diseases  <cit> . strain b <dig> contains a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig> and a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig>  hpb8_ <dig> and hpb8_ <dig> are both located in the pz of strain b <dig>  there is also a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig>  a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig>  and a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig>  these j99-genes are reported to be significantly more frequent in isolates from patients with gastric cancer. strain b <dig> also contains a coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> with homology to jhp <dig>  which is reported to be more frequent in isolates from patients suffering duodenal ulcer  <cit> .

in the pz of strain b <dig> there are  <dig> singletons  of which  <dig> are functionally annotated . removing p <dig> from the list of reference strains, one obtains  <dig> singletons in the pz of strain b <dig>  of these singletons,  <dig> are functionally annotated. the divergent number of singletons inside the pz of strain b <dig> can be explained by the fact that the 3'-part of the pz is highly similar to the plasticity zone pz <dig> of strain p <dig> . all coding sequences of the pz <dig> of strain p <dig> are present in the pz of strain b <dig>  except for the coding sequences virb7- <dig> and the genes hpp12_ <dig> and hpp12_ <dig> of strain p <dig>  the latter two are part of the merged gene hpb8_ <dig> 

description of the cag pathogenicity island of strain b8
in the genome of strain b <dig>  the cag pathogenicity island  is located between position  <dig>  and  <dig>  . all essential genes for the type iv-secretion system are present in strain b <dig> 

comparing the cag-pai of strain b <dig> with other h. pylori-strains one observes a rearrangement in the region delimited by the dapb-gene and the muri-gene, as well as a translocation of the caga-gene. in the h. pylori strains  <dig>  j <dig>  hpag <dig>  and p <dig> the regions delimited by the caga-gene and the cag1-gene  is located coherently between the era-gene  and the muri-gene . in strain b <dig> the caga-gene is located separately from the region delimited by the cag1-gene and the cagb-gene between a cluster of six coding sequences  upstream of caga on one side and a hypothetical protein next to the muri-gene downstream of the caga-gene on the other side . the coding sequences from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig> are all singletons, while hpb8_ <dig> is a variable gene. with respect to the reference strains, the region delimited by the cag1-gene and the cagb-gene is inverted and occurs  <dig>  bp upstream of the caga-gene . a blastn comparison of different is-elements of the previously sequenced h. pylori genomes against strain b <dig> gives a hit with bit score  <dig> to the insertion sequence is <dig>  located between the muri-gene and the caga-gene.

the amino acid sequences of the caga proteins of strain b <dig> and the reference strains occur highly conserved . comparing the amino acid sequences of the caga epiya regions, one observes a much smaller identity of  <dig> %. the caga protein of strain b <dig> contains the epiya motifs a and c which is identical to that of strain  <dig>  strain p <dig> possesses the most pronounced epiya motifs . except for strain p <dig>  all strains lack the epiya motif b due to a mutation of alanine to threonine resulting in epiyt.

characterization of unknown genes by codon usage analysis
the four singletons hpb8_ <dig>  hpb8_ <dig>  hpb8_ <dig>  and hpb8_ <dig> located within the region separating caga from the gene cluster cagb to cag <dig>  are of unknown function and do not show any homology to previously sequenced h. pylori strains. the variable gene hpb8_ <dig> is annotated as a regulator of nonsense transcripts. to characterize the origin of the coding sequences from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig>  a codon usage analysis was performed . in particular, the five coding sequences were compared to  the cag-pai,  to all other coding sequences of strain b <dig>  and  to  <dig> randomly selected coding sequences of strain b <dig>  additionally, the codon usage of strain b <dig> was compared to the codon usage of helicobacter acinonychis sheeba  and e. coli k <dig> , for taking into account the differences of the bacterial genera, see additional file  <dig>  figure s <dig> 

compared to the other genes of strain b <dig>  the group of five genes from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig> as well as the cag-pai show a different codon usage. for the cag-pai, this difference is statistically significant . in contrast, the ten coding sequences randomly selected from strain b <dig> show a codon usage similar to all other coding sequences of strain b <dig>  the codon usage of strain b <dig> and helicobacter acinonychis sheeba is highly similar, whereas the codon usage of e. coli k <dig> is significantly different compared to these two helicobacter strains . this fact suggests the hypothesis that strain b <dig> acquired the five genes from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig> via horizontal gene transfer from other bacterial species.

characterization of the plasmid phpb8
the plasmid phpb <dig> of strain b <dig> has  <dig>  bp and a gc content of  <dig> %. it contains nine coding sequences , five of which are functionally annotated . one coding sequence of strain b <dig>  shows homology to the replication initiation protein a . furthermore, there are homologies to the moba-gene , to the mobb-gene , to the mobc-gene , and to the mobd-gene . the mob-genes are reported to encode conjugal mobilization proteins. in phpb <dig> they are organized in a cluster. phpb <dig> was compared to phpp <dig>  and phel <dig> . in all three plasmids the repa-gene and the cluster of mob-genes are present. additionally, all three plasmids contain a coding sequence for a plasmid stabilization system protein  and a conserved hypothetical protein . the mccc-gene and mccb-gene coding for microcin are present in phel <dig> and phpp <dig>  but not in phpb <dig> 

discussion
the gram-negative pathogen h. pylori is an interesting model system for microorganisms persisting in the host for decades. to study the adaptation and persistence process in the stomach, an animal model mimicking the human situation is required. the mongolian gerbil model is a suitable model, as it was shown that a lasting h. pylori-infection results in the gastric carcinogenic pathway  <cit>  via gastritis, atrophy, metaplasia, and dysplasia, and finally inducing gastric adenocarcinoma  <cit> . these gerbils were infected with classified h. pylori type i-strains, expressing a functional t4ss able to translocate the oncoprotein caga into the host cells, where it can be tyrosin-phosphorylated by host kinases  <cit> . in a time course study the gerbils were challenged with a gerbil-adapted h. pylori-strain b <dig>  originating from the human isolate b <dig>  to improve its adaptation, strain b <dig> was passaged several times through stomach of mongolian gerbils from our breeding colony.

up to now there are nine finished whole genome sequences of different h. pylori-strains available in ddbj/embl/genbank  <cit> . all these strains are human isolates representing genetic features of specific gastroduodenal diseases, such as gastritis, peptic ulcer, and malignant sequelae. for a better understanding of the h. pylori-induced gastric pathogenesis and its basic molecular mechanism involved, the complete sequencing of the pathogen is a good approach.

for the current study we sequenced, annotated, and analyzed for the first time the whole genome of a gerbil-adapted h. pylori-strain. one goal of this study was to elucidate the effect of adaptation of the parental strain b <dig> on the genome level. since the genome of strain b <dig> consists of  <dig> supercontigs , another goal was the comparative analysis to other available fully sequenced h. pylori genomes.

the genome comparison of strain b <dig> with the recently sequenced parental strain b <dig> reveals that all  <dig> supercontigs can be mapped to the finished genome of strain b <dig> covering about 98% of the sequence. the uncovered genome regions of strain b <dig> contain  <dig> coding sequences . for  <dig> of these coding sequences there is no 80/ <dig> blastn hit somewhere in the genome of strain b <dig>  therefore, in a strict sense these coding sequences are not strain-specific, because they are likely to occur in a completely sequenced genome of strain b <dig> . furthermore,  <dig>  genes of strain b <dig>  completely match with no differences to the b128-supercontigs, and  <dig>  genes of strain b <dig>  completely match with less than 2% differences . this reveals that the supercontigs of strain b <dig> are highly identical to the finished sequence of strain b <dig>  about 20% of the coding sequences of strain b <dig> have between one and  <dig> differences, whereas only  <dig> % of these coding sequences were found with two or more differences. at this point it is not possible to elucidate exactly the cause of these observations. some of these differences may be due to the stomach passages, others due to sequencing errors.

in total, we found  <dig> genes of strain b <dig>  with a length variation when comparing all genes of strain b <dig> with the other h. pylori strains . eppinger et al.  <cit>  found  <dig> fragmented genes in h. acinonychis representing a ratio of 6%. this higher ratio may be due to a host jump of h. acinonychis from human to large felines. however, we have to consider that the adaptation from early humans to large felines is a much longer process  than the adaptation of the parental strain b <dig> to the mongolian gerbil during several stomach passages.

resequencing the fragmented genes by sanger technology, we were able to eliminate a homopolymer error in the 454-reads  <cit> . in only two cases we had to revise the sequence, all other fragmented or length variable genes were confirmed. these results indicate that the combination of 454-pyrosequencing  and sanger-sequencing  delivered a high quality sequence, which, before gap closure, consisted of only  <dig> supercontigs.

comparing the predicted proteins of strains b <dig> and b <dig>  one obtains  <dig>  -  <dig> =  <dig>  proteins of strain b <dig> that have a 100/ <dig> blastp hit in strain b <dig> . when using the less stringent 80/ <dig> blastp hit criterion for the comparison, there are  <dig> predicted proteins in strain b <dig> and  <dig>  of the corresponding coding sequences match completely with at most 2% differences to the genome of strain b <dig>  this indicates that in most cases the dna sequence is present in strain b <dig>  but the corresponding coding sequence has not been annotated sufficiently. out of the remaining  <dig> singletons,  <dig> have to be regarded as "weak"  and  <dig> as "strong"  singletons, of which  <dig> are functionally annotated . interestingly the genes hpb8_ <dig>  and hpb8_ <dig>  are both reported to have an important role in iron acquisition. the iron repressible outer membrane protein tonb possibly serves as a receptor for the uptake of heme  <cit> , whereas feob is reported to act as a high affinity fe2+ transporter  <cit> . the gene hpb8_ <dig>  encodes a plasminogen-binding protein. in previous studies it was demonstrated, that pgba intervenes with the mammalian proteolytic plasminogen-plasmin system  <cit> . due to the fact that interaction with the plasminogen system promotes damage of extracellular matrices and bacterial spread, plasminogen binding activity might be relevant for pathogenesis  <cit> . further genes are related to chemotaxis  and hydrogen metabolism . possibly these genes are important for the adaptation process during the stomach passages in the mongolian gerbils. hpb8_ <dig> , hpb8_ <dig> , and hpb8_ <dig>  are of special interest, because they also appear as singletons when comparing strain b <dig> against the reference strains  <dig>  j <dig>  p <dig>  and hpag <dig>  we remark that our definition of singletons is based on comparisons of the genes on the protein sequence level. thus the singletons may include highly variable genes .

using even less stringent parameters   <dig> strain-specific genes in strain b <dig> are obtained . in contrast to the singletons , the genes with length variations  may also be candidates for explaining the gerbil-adaptation. these genes need to be studied further to understand the adaptation mechanism to the gerbil gastric mucosa.

the gene annotation for the genome of strain b <dig> was done automatically. unfortunately, there is no functional annotation to any of the coding sequences: all coding sequences are annotated as 'hypothetical protein'. however, functional annotations or further homology information can be derived for many genes of strain b <dig> by exploiting the fact that there are  <dig>  pairs of orthologous genes between strain b <dig> and b <dig>  among these, there are  <dig>  genes in strain b <dig> that have functional annotations, or for which homology to genes in other genomes exist. each of these genes suggests a reasonable annotation for the coding sequences of strain b <dig> which in turn would allow to considerably improve the annotation of the genome of strain b <dig>  of course, a final conclusive comparative analysis of the genome of strain b <dig> versus the parental strain b <dig> would require to close the gaps of strain b <dig> and to improve the annotation.

the genome of strain b <dig> consists of a single circular chromosome of  <dig> , <dig> bp with a gc content of  <dig> %. it contains  <dig>  coding sequences ,  <dig> % of which are functionally annotated. the general features of the gerbil-adapted strain b <dig> are consistent with other four sequenced genomes , except that strain b <dig> has more coding sequences  and considerably more strain-specific coding sequences. in particular, there are 44% more strain-specific genes in strain b <dig> than in any of the other analyzed h. pylori genomes. this is supported by the large number of phase variable genes, building a genetic pool for possible adaptation processes.

among the  <dig> strain-specific coding sequences there are several dna methylases, restriction endonucleases, and dna transfer proteins supporting the genetic diversification process of h. pylori. the analysis of the singletons of strain b <dig> according to the pathogenicity of the reference strains revealed a remarkable difference in the virb and vird proteins of the additional t4ss  between the duodenal ulcer and gastritis strains. nevertheless, no clear tendency could be demonstrated for the pathogenicity groups since israel et al. presented a strain  isolated from a duodenal ulcer patient that did not carry a functional t4ss  <cit> . thus, a functional t4ss might not be necessary for developing duodenal ulcer. interestingly three dna modification genes  were also present in the microarray study of the peptic ulcer strains j <dig> and b <dig>  <cit> . this suggests the hypothesis that these genes may be involved in the development of gastroduodenal lesions.

strain b <dig> contains a  <dig>  bp plasmid  with a gc content of  <dig> %. the plasmid has nine coding sequences, five of which are functionally annotated. phpb <dig> is on of the smallest h. pylori plasmids isolated so far, but nevertheless it encodes the expected replication initiation protein a  and the cluster of four conjugal mobilization proteins  as well as a plasmid stabilization system protein. our comparative analysis with the b128-supercontigs indicates that the parental strain b <dig> already contains this strain-specific plasmid phpb <dig>  however, this was neither annotated as such, nor mentioned in the publication of mcclain et al.  <cit> .

a genome comparison of strain b <dig> versus strains  <dig> and j <dig> based on 80/ <dig> blastn hits and visualized by the artemis comparison tool   <cit>  reveals a large pz of  <dig> kbp, containing  <dig> coding sequences with a gc content of 34%. the 3'-region of the pz of strain b <dig> is very similar to the pz <dig> of strain p <dig> . it is shown that this pz <dig> belongs to a type  <dig> tnpz, encoding a novel t4ss- <dig>  flanked by direct repeats of 5'-aagaatg-3'  <cit> . most coding sequences of the tfs <dig> of strain p <dig>  have a corresponding coding sequence in the t4ss of strain b <dig>  the tfs <dig> of strain b <dig> has one coding sequence less  and a merged coding sequence hpb8_ <dig> of which the first part corresponds to the coding sequence hpp12_ <dig> and the second part to the coding sequence hpp12_ <dig> . besides the tfs <dig>  there are several typical coding sequences in the pz of strain b8: a flanking 5s/23s-rrna gene pair, the topa-gene , the vird2-gene, the para-gene , the orfq-gene , the xerd-gene , and a transposable element is <dig>  moreover, several of the singletons of strain b <dig> are located within its pz. interestingly, the pz of strain b <dig> contains several coding sequences  that show homology to genes reported to be significantly more frequent in isolates of patients suffering from gastroduodenal diseases such as peptic ulcer and gastric cancer  <cit> .

the more virulent h. pylori type i-strains are expressing a functional t4ss that is encoded on the cag-pai. the gerbil-adapted type i-strain b <dig> was used to study the role of the cag-pai on the development of precancerous conditions in mongolian gerbils  <cit> . pcr-amplification of the caga-gene starting from adjacent genes, using h. pylori  <dig> as reference sequence, did not lead to an amplification product. this discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the cag-pai of strain b <dig> has a rearrangement between the dapb-gene and the muri-gene. moreover, there is a translocation of the caga-gene  <dig>  bp downstream of the inverted gene cluster from the cagb-gene to the cag1-gene. interestingly, there are four hypothetical proteins and one variable gene directly adjacent to caga. to derive hypothesis of its origin, a codon usage analysis was performed. this involves the cag-pai genes, the five coding sequences from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig> and ten randomly selected genes of strain b <dig>  as well as all remaining genes of strain b <dig>  this codon usage of the cag-pai and of the five genes from hpb8_ <dig> to hpb8_ <dig> significantly differs from the codon usage of the other two groups of coding sequences. this suggests that strain b <dig> acquired the five coding sequences with unknown function and possibly also the cag-pai via horizontal gene transfer.

CONCLUSIONS
in this current study we sequenced and annotated the whole genome of the gerbil-adapted h. pylori-strain b <dig> . the genome analysis suggests that this type i-strain possibly has acquired the virulence mechanism encoded in the cag-pai as well as other adjacent unknown genes via horizontal gene transfer. this may have occurred during microevolution optimizing the adaptation to its hostile niche, the gastric mucosa. the relatively large number of singletons, the existence of length variable genes, and the large pz may already reflect an adaptation-process to the gerbil stomach. altogether, this pathogen may use its dynamic pool of genetic variants, representing a sufficient genetic diversity to allow h. pylori to occupy all of the potential niches in the stomach.
