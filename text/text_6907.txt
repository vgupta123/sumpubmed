BACKGROUND
the promoter region of genes is typically divided into two regions: the core or basal promoter region and the proximal promoter. the core promoter region stretches from around - <dig> bp to + <dig> bp and is the location in the promoter where the pre-initiation complex forms and the general transcriptional machinery assembles, including rna polymerase ii . the proximal promoter extends from - <dig> bp to the transcriptional start site  and contains transcription factor binding sites  that are critical for the recruitment of rna polymerase ii  to dna  <cit> . in mammalian genomes, the cpg dinucleotide occurs at 20% of the expected frequency  <cit>  and is typically methylated both in cell cuture and animal tissues  <cit> . the exception is in cpg islands. cpg islands are defined as regions in the dna at least  <dig> bp long where c+g comprise more than 50% of the nucleotides and cpg dinucleotides occur at greater than 60% the expected frequency   <cit> . the presence of cpg islands is associated with gene regulatory regions  <cit>  and in the promoters of genes generally correlates with binding by rna polymerase ii   <cit> . promoters of housekeeping genes are constitutively bound by rnap in all tissues while regulated promoters, either tissue specific or inducible, are selectively bound by rnap in only certain tissue or contexts respectively  <cit> .

three advances allow us to interrogate the genome-wide properties of promoters. first is the availability of complete genomic sequences. second is the determination of full-length cdnas that can identify the tss and proximal promoter  <cit> . third is the determination of the chromatin architecture of the genome by the identification of hypersensitive sites  <cit>  or the location of particular proteins or their modified forms using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by microarray analysis   <cit> . although chip-chip experiments have identified the location of rnap and components of the preinitiation complex in particular tissues  <cit> , these experiments have not been done systematically over a range of tissues.

we show that all and only cpg containing dna sequences are associated with rnap binding to the same promoter in multiple tissues. many dna sequences are more abundant near the tss than elsewhere  <cit>  and the six most abundant cpg containing sequences that are localized in proximal promoters are known tfbs and can predict rnap binding to housekeeping promoters with similar accuracy as the presence of cpg islands.

RESULTS
binding of rnap and h3k9me <dig> to mouse promoters in keratinocytes, liver, and heart ventricles
to gain insight into the dna sequence properties of housekeeping promoters, we analyzed rnap binding to promoters in three mouse tissues: primary skin keratinocytes, liver, and heart ventricles. using chip-chip experiments  <cit> , we determined the genomic localization of initiating  rnap  <cit>  in all three tissues . dna from the rnap chip analysis was amplified and hybridized to nimblegen mouse promoter microarrays containing  <dig> probes spanning from - <dig>  bp to + <dig> bp . signal intensities were averaged for each promoter to produce a number representing binding at each promoter. this produced a graded binding of rnap to promoter regions as has been previously observed  <cit> . raw data for these chip-chip experiments can be found at the vinson laboratory web site  <cit> . we limited the following analysis of dna sequence properties to the set of  <dig>  promoters that contains neither similar/duplicated sequences nor a poorly annotated transcriptional start site .

to identify promoters that had similar rnap binding values in all three tissues, we excluded genes where rnap binding between any pair of tissues was significantly different. this excluded  <dig> tissue-specific  promoters, and  <dig> with high rnap binding in two of the three tissues. the remaining  <dig>  promoters  have similar rnap binding in all three tissues, some being well bound by rnap and others having little rnap at the promoter . for each of these  <dig>  promoters, termed common rnap promoters, rnap binding values from the three tissues were normalized and averaged, producing a single number representing rnap binding to a promoter across the three tissues.

to investigate the dna sequence properties of the  <dig>  common promoters  and determine potential transcription factor binding sites  that are responsible for rnap binding we analyzed the occurrences of  <dig> bp-long dna sequences  in common rnap promoters. 8-mers were chosen because their length is similar to that of known tfbs. 8-mers were counted on the sense and anti-sense strands because, with the exception of tata  <cit> , 8-mers are not restricted to a single strand. of all  <dig>  8-mers  we extensively characterized the  <dig>  most abundant 8-mers  of which only 20% contained a cpg highlighting that the cpg dinucleotide is underrepresented even in promoter regions  <cit> .

all 8-mers enriched in promoters well bound by rnap in multiple tissues contain a cpg dinucleotide
to measure 8-mer enrichment in promoters commonly bound by rnap, we calculated the term "8-mer-association-with-rnap" for all 8-mers. this term is the average rnap binding to promoters that contain a particular 8-mer normalized by the average rnap binding to all common promoters. the value "8-mer-association-with-rnap" is calculated for each 8-mer by first identifying all the promoters that contain that particular 8-mer, and then averaging the rnap binding values of those promoters. these values are then normalized by dividing by the average of the rnap binding values of all common promoters. a histogram of these values has a bimodal distribution. 20% of 8-mers are associated with high rnap binding to common rnap promoters . this result suggests that the graded binding of rnap to promoters is caused by a combination of 8-mers, some of which favor rnap binding and others which do not. the region of the promoter  critical for the observed bimodal distribution extends from - <dig> bp to + <dig> bp . strikingly, nearly all the 8-mers that are associated with rnap binding contain the cpg dinucleotide while virtually none of the remaining 8-mers contain a cpg. in contrast to the cpg dinucleotide, the other dinucleotides did not exclusively occur in either part of the bimodal distribution . a spreadsheet containing the 8-mer-association-with-rnap for all 8-mers is included in the supplementary material .

to evaluate if other types of promoters have a different enrichment of 8-mers, we examined the transcriptionally inactive genes marked by a post-translationally modified form of histone  <dig>  h3k9me <dig>   <cit> . in keratinocytes, chip-chip identification of h3k9me <dig> genomic localization negatively correlated with rnap  . the 8-mer-association-with-h3k9me <dig> also had a bimodal distribution with the cpg containing 8-mers associating the least with h3k9me <dig> binding . as anticipated , practically all the 8-mers most associated with common rnap binding also are least associated with h3k9me <dig> binding . similar results were obtained when all 8-mers were examined .

the 8-mers with and without a cpg were plotted separately to highlight the few 8-mers that are the exception to the general conclusion that only cpg containing sequences are associated with rnap binding to a promoters . the most notable exception is the gaccaatc 8-mer, a ccaat sequence that is enriched in housekeeping promoters.

previous work indicated that ~50% of human promoters bound by rnap contain the inr and dpe consensus sequences between - <dig> bp and + <dig> bp  <cit> . to see if these non-cpg-containing sequences were also exceptions to our general conclusion, we calculated the association-with-rnap and association-with-h3k9me <dig> for tata, inr and dpe in the set of promoters with similar rnap binding values in the three tissues we have examined. this was accomplished by averaging the binding values of those promoters that contained the consensus sequence at the expected position  <cit> . in mouse, the consensus tata is uniquely positioned in only  <dig> % of promoters and has a very high association-with-h3k9me <dig> binding to promoters. the inr was uniquely positioned in only 9% of promoters and is associated with h3k9me <dig> bound promoters. dpe is not uniquely positioned in promoters, but occurs in 19% of promoters at the expected location and is also associated with h3k9me <dig> binding . this suggests that tata, inr and the dpe are not important for rnap binding to promoters in multiple tissues. presumably these sequences are important for tissue-specific gene expression.

cpg sequences are also associated with mrna expression
we examined whether rnap binding to the promoter correlates with mrna expression levels in the genes whose promoters are bound similarly by rnap in the three tissues examined. mrna expression data for heart ventricle was obtained  <cit>  and compared to rnap binding levels for the  <dig>  promoters that share a common identifier . we calculated the 8-mers-association-with-mrna-expression and found the same 8-mers associated with rnap binding to promoters also associated with mrna expression . thus, cpg-containing 8-mers are most enriched in promoters that have the highest rnap binding and mrna expression.

sequences most enriched in tissue-specific promoters do not contain a cpg
the dna sequence properties of tissue specific promoters that were well bound by rnap in only one tissue were compared with housekeeping promoters well bound by rnap in all three tissues. the abundant 8-mers most enriched in the  <dig> liver specific promoters do not contain cpg and were different than those associated with rnap binding in all three tissues . as expected, the liver-specific transcription factor hnf <dig> is enriched in the liver-specific genes. the fact that tata sequences are also enriched in the liver specific genes is consistent with suggestions that it is a marker for tissue specific, not constitutive gene expression  <cit> . some cpg containing 8-mers are enriched in the liver specific genes indicating that in addition to their housekeeping function, these sequences also mediate tissues specific gene expression. this has been well documented for the cre   <cit> .

non-random distribution of 8-mers in promoters
if the 8-mers that associate with rnap binding are tfbs, they may be localized in the proximal promoter as has been observed in human  <cit>  and drosophila promoters  <cit> . we thus determined the "clustering factor"   <cit>  for abundant 8-mers in promoters, and compared it to 8-mer-association-with-rnap. some 8-mers were preferentially localized near the tss . the 8-mers most associated with promoters commonly bound by rnap had a high cf . however, there was also a class of 8-mers with high cfs but low 8-mer-association-with-rnap values that may represent tfbs involved in regulated gene expression.

the  <dig> 8-mers with the statistically highest cf  that localize upstream of the tss could be manually grouped into ten consensus motifs that are known tfbs: ets, nrf- <dig>  e-box, boxa, cre, sp <dig>  klf, ccaat, tata, and cre-t , six of which contain a cpg dinucleotide . a similar analysis has identified that these ten motifs localize to the proximal promoter in human promoters  <cit> . the six motifs that contain a cpg in the consensus motif  always positively correlated with each other in the proximal promoter, exceeding expectations by up to two fold , were enriched in the 20% of promoters best bound by rnap in all three tissues , and were underrepresented in h3k9me <dig> marked promoters . ets, nrf- <dig>  and boxa correlate the best with rnap binding to promoters in multiple tissues . of the ten identified motifs, only tata and cre-t were enriched in the 20% of promoters best marked by h3k9me <dig> in keratinocytes . to see if these tfbs play some specific role in mrna expression or rnap binding, we calculated the association-with-mrna-expression and association-with-rnap for the consensus sequences of these tfbs . as expected, the cpg-containing tfbs have high association values for both mrna expression and rnap binding.

column one contains the name of the motif; column two contains the dna sequence of the motif; column three is the 8-mer-association-with-rnap for promoters  commonly bound by rnap in the three tissues examined ranked in order by association; column four is 8-mer-association-with-mrna-expression.

cpg islands can be defined by two or more of the six cpg containing tfbs
previous work has suggested that housekeeping genes can be defined by the presence of a cpg island in the promoter region  <cit> , but the dna sequences properties of cpg islands has not been described. we evaluated if the presence of the six cpg consensus motifs in proximal promoters  predicts rnap binding to promoters commonly bound by rnap and compared these results with the occurrence of a cpg island between - <dig> bp to the tss . the results demonstrate that the presence of any two of these motifs recapitulates the discrimination based on the presence of a cpg island in regards to rnap binding to common promoters. in order to compare these two measures, we grouped promoters into ten equal size groups with increased rnap binding. 80% of promoters in the group best bound by rnap contain a cpg island and a similar number contain two or more of the six motifs . similarly, only 5% of promoters with the lowest rnap binding values are cpg islands, and only about 5% have two or more motifs . the presence of three or more of these motifs produced a lower positive hit rate in the best bound group  but occurred in only 1% of promoters not bound by rnap. therefore, our analysis suggests that cpg islands have predictive value in defining housekeeping genes because of the presence of these six tfbs motifs. these six motifs do not account for all cpgs in cpg islands. some of the other cpgs are known tfbs but the function of the rest remains unclear. they could be sequences that persist because they are protected from methylation and ultimate destruction or they could be involved in the higher-level regulatory processes that have been proposed for cpg islands  <cit> . in contrast to promoters well bound by rnap in multiple tissues, only 20% of tissue specific proximal promoters are cpg islands and similarly only 20% contain two or more of these six motifs. this indicates that these six motifs correlate with promoters that are bound by rnap in multiple tissues and not tissue specific promoters .

nuclear extracts do not bind tfbs with a methylated cpg
methylation of cpg dinucleotides in cpg islands inhibits promoter activity and occurs in many cancers where the oncogenic event is the transcriptional suppression of tumor suppressor genes  <cit> . one simple explanation is that cpg methylation inhibits tfs from binding their tfbs resulting in promoter inactivity. a more prevalent, but not mutually exclusive view suggests that a more active mechanism is functioning in which methyl binding proteins bind methylated cpgs to facilitate chromatin mediated occlusion of the promoter  <cit> . the effect of cpg methylation on the function of five of the six cpg containing tfbs  that localize in the proximal promoter has been described. the one exception is boxa, for which the effect of cpg methylation on dna binding has not been reported in the literature. in general, methylation inhibits the activity of cpg containing tfbs  <cit> . cpg methylation is reported to inhibit the function of a cre  <cit> , ets  <cit> , nrf- <dig>  <cit> , and e-box  <cit> . other cpg containing motifs are also inhibited via methylation including ap <dig>  <cit>  and ctcf  <cit> . methylation of the cpg in the sp <dig> motif, the most abundant cpg containing motif, is reported to either not affect dna binding  <cit> , affect binding when a cytosine flanking the cpg is methylated  <cit>  or inhibit binding  <cit> .

we observe that cpg methylation of a canonical sp <dig>  ets, or nrf- <dig> site abolishes dna binding of nuclear extracts isolated from either liver or primary keratinocytes . when both dna strands of a canonical sp <dig> site are methylated, nuclear extract binding are abolished. for ets, methylation of a one strand of dna is sufficient to abolish dna binding while for nrf- <dig>  methyation of both cpgs in the canonical site on either strand is sufficient to abolished binding. as a control, we show that the methylated sp <dig> oligonucleotides could bind to the non-specific prokaryotic protein hu. reexamination of previous reports indicates that sp <dig> methylation causes a modest decrease in sp <dig> binding that our experimental system is able to demonstrate more dramatically.

CONCLUSIONS
we identified promoters that are bound similarly by rnap in multiple tissues and determined the association between the presence of 8-mers in these promoters and the extent of rnap binding to the promoter. looking at rnap binding to housekeeping promoters, we observed a bimodal distribution: only 8-mers with the cpg dinucleotide are in the class of sequences most associated with rnap binding and only 8-mers without a cpg are in the class least associated with rnap binding. an implication of this observation is that knowing if a tfbs contains a cpg reveals aspects of its biological function. if the tfbs contains a cpg, it is involved in constitutive gene expression and if the tfbs does not contain a cpg, it is involved in regulated gene expression. this insight will help identify potential functions for transcription factors when their tfbs is identified. additionally, if a transcription factor shows degeneracy in its tfbs  <cit> , binding to a cpg sequence and a similar sequence without a cpg, it suggests that this transcription factor is involved in both constitutive and regulated gene expression. this is observed for the cre and cre-t sequences, two sequences that are localized in the proximal promoter and differ by a single base: cre contains a cpg  while cre-t does not . the creb protein binds both sequences well  but the two sequences correlate very differently with rnap binding suggesting that the creb transcription factor can regulate either constitutive gene expression by binding the cre sequence or regulated gene expression by binding the cre-t sequence.

in vertebrates cpg dinucleotides are rare and usually are methylated on the cytosine but do occur at close to the expected frequency in clusters called cpg islands where the cpgs remain unmethylated  <cit> . these cpg islands often occur in promoters of housekeeping genes  <cit> . we show that the presence of two or more of any of the six cpg containing tfbs  in the proximal promoter can predict rnap binding to housekeeping promoters as accurately as the presence of a cpg island in the proximal promoter.

methylation of the cpg in the tfbs has been found to inhibit the dna binding for five of the six tfbs that are abundant and localize in proximal promoters suggesting this may be a general result for cpg containing tfbs. methylation dependent inhibition of transcription factor binding to dna has two implications. first, the transcription factors that are critical for the activation of housekeeping genes solve the problem of finding their tfbs in the genome by only binding to unmethylated tfbs. since most cpgs in the genome are methylated, the only places these transcription factors can bind are in the unmethylated cpg islands in promoters. second, the pathological methylation of cpg dinucleotides in cpg islands, as occurs in many cancers  <cit> , would prevent these abundant transcription factors from binding their tfbs thus causing the promoters to become inactive. this could be a critical initial step that subsequently allows cpg methyl binding proteins to bind to methylated cpgs and actively repress a promoter  <cit> .
