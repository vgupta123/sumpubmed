BACKGROUND
peroxiredoxins  are ubiquitous peroxidases with important roles in detoxification of hydrogen peroxide, alkyl hydroperoxides and peroxynitrites  <cit> . prxs are characterized by a conserved alkylhydroperoxide c  or thiol–specific antioxidant  domain that contains a thioredoxin fold. prxs have highly conserved cysteine residues, peroxidatic cysteine  and resolving cysteine , which are essential for peroxidase activity. based on their catalytic mechanisms and the presence of conserved cysteine residues, prxs are classified into three groups, namely, typical 2-cys-prx, atypical 2-cys prx  and 1-cys-prx  <cit> .

the typical 2-cys-prxs are functionally conserved across diverse organisms and form the largest group of peroxiredoxins. recently, 2-cys-prx has been shown to be a conserved marker of circadian rhythms in all the three phylogenetic domains viz. eukaryota, bacteria and archaea  <cit> . in typical 2-cys-prxs, cp is present near n-terminus while cr is located in the vicinity of c-terminus. on reaction with a peroxide substrate, cp  is oxidized to sulfenic acid , which in turn reacts with the thiol group of the resolving cysteine from other subunit to form an intermolecular disulfide bridge  <cit> . the active form of enzyme is regenerated with the help of reductants like thioredoxin. in the presence of excess substrate , cp of 2-cys-prx may undergo overoxidation to form sulfinic acid , which prevents disulfide bond formation, rendering the enzyme inactive. however, in many organisms, sulfiredoxin  reduces the overoxidized cp to its catalytically active form  <cit> . sensitivity to overoxidation depends on the structural motifs, ggg and yf, which are believed to be present in the eukaryotic 2-cys-prxs, but generally absent in the corresponding prokaryotic enzymes  <cit> .

the typical 2-cys-prx plays a vital role in detoxifying peroxides in all the kingdoms of life. transgenic arabidopsis with decreased 2-cys-prx in chloroplast showed oxidative damage of chloroplastid proteins indicating that 2-cys-prx protects the photosynthetic machinery from oxidative damage  <cit> . also, arabidopsis mutant lacking both the chloroplastid 2-cys-prx displayed altered redox homeostasis and showed increased h2o <dig> levels in leaves  <cit> . overexpression of 2-cys-prx has been shown to protect potato plants from oxidative stress and high temperature  <cit> . in tobacco, the chloroplastid 2-cys-prx has been implicated in protecting cells from photoinhibition following exposure to high light, methyl viologen  or t-butyl hydroperoxide  <cit> . disruption of gene encoding 2-cys-prx in synechocystis as well as in synechococcus eliminated tolerance against h2o <dig>  <cit> . in bacteria like sulfolobus solfataricus and vibrio vulnificus, 2-cys-prx has been proposed to detoxify endogenously generated hydrogen peroxide, thus, supporting its role as an anti-oxidative stress protein  <cit> .

interestingly, the typical 2-cys-prx not only defends cells from oxidative stress, but also functions as redox-regulated chaperone depending on its oligomerization status  <cit> . the 2-cys prx from pseudomonas aeruginosa, on exposure to h2o <dig>  converts into a low molecular weight  form from its high molecular weight  form. this change triggers a chaperone to peroxidase functional switch  <cit> . in case of 2-cys prx from yeast, oxidative stress and heat shock triggers conversion from lmw form to hmw structure, which shows chaperone activity  <cit> . in stroma of chloroplast, under conditions of stress, the dimeric 2-cys-prx switches to its oligomeric form and binds reversibly to the thylakoid membrane  <cit> . it is widely believed that the dimeric form of 2-cys-prx shows peroxidatic functions while oligomerization is essential for chaperone activity  <cit> .

cyanobacteria, progenitors of plant chloroplasts, were the first organisms to produce oxygen as a by-product of photosynthesis  <cit> . hence, it is expected that these organisms would have developed elaborate mechanisms to overcome oxidative stress. filamentous forms of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria  are economically important as biofertilizers during cultivation of paddy in southeast asia  <cit> . anabaena pcc <dig>  a filamentous, heterocystous, diazotrophic cyanobacterium, that tolerates abiotic stresses like radiation and desiccation, has been used as a suitable model system to study the fundamental aspects of adaptive responses to various stresses including oxidative stress in our laboratory  <cit> . genome sequence analysis has shown anabaena pcc <dig> to possess several peroxiredoxin genes/orfs   <cit> . the alr <dig>  alr <dig>  all <dig> and all <dig> belong to prxq-type of peroxiredoxins, all <dig> is a type ii prx, alr <dig> is a 1-cys-prx, alr <dig> is prx-like, whereas alr <dig> is a typical 2-cys-prx  <cit> .

earlier, 2-cys-prx from anabaena was shown to be prone to over-oxidation  <cit>  and was found to utilize nadph-dependent thioredoxin reductase  as reducing agent for peroxidase activity like the 2-cys-prx from rice  <cit> . in this study, expression analysis in response to various stresses, redox dependent chaperone/peroxidase function and the role played by this enzyme in protecting anabaena from oxidative stress were addressed. along with oxidative stress, alr4641/alr <dig> was induced by salt/osmotic/γ-radiation stress in anabaena and the alr <dig> protein was expressed in the vegetative cells as well as heterocysts. alr <dig> formed higher oligomeric complexes and showed peroxidase/chaperone function. unlike peroxidase activity, chaperone activity of alr <dig> did not depend on the conserved cysteine residues. interestingly, reduction of alr <dig> with dtt resulted in loss of chaperone activity whereas treatment with h2o <dig> inactivated peroxidase function. over-expression of alr <dig> in anabaena protected the photosynthetic machinery from h2o2-induced damage via its peroxidatic cysteine, leading to better survival than the wild-type anabaena; thus, establishing its protective role in overcoming oxidative stress.

RESULTS
abiotic stresses induce alr4641/alr <dig> expression in anabaena
expression of alr <dig> in response to different oxidative stress inducing agents was assessed by northern blotting-hybridization/dot blot analysis. the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> cells were treated with methyl viologen , hydrogen peroxide  or tertiary butyl hydroperoxide  for 1 h. subsequently, cells were harvested, total rna isolated and probed with the alr <dig> gene probe. results showed distinct induction of ~ <dig> -knt transcript in rna isolated from anabaena cells exposed to the above-mentioned oxidizing agents as compared to the untreated  cells . interestingly, treatment with sucrose or nacl also enhanced the levels of the alr <dig> transcript . although, alr <dig> expression was observed as early as after 30 min of exposure to h2o <dig>  maximal expression occurred by 1 h after which it declined and disappeared at the end of 6 h . expression profile of the alr <dig> transcript exposed to different concentrations of oxidative/osmotic stress causing agents for 1 h was monitored. with increasing concentrations, a concomitant rise in the level of the alr <dig> transcript was observed . western blotting followed by immunodetection with the alr <dig> antiserum revealed salt, sucrose and mv to increase the content of the alr <dig> protein as compared to the untreated control cells . interestingly, the alr <dig> transcript was also induced in response to ionizing  radiation, a physical agent that causes oxidative stress . post irradiation, during recovery, a clear enhancement in the content of the 2-cys-prx protein was observed .figure  <dig>

alr <dig> promoter is expressed in the vegetative cells as well as heterocysts
as distinct induction of alr <dig> was observed in response to various abiotic stresses, it was desired to locate the alr <dig> promoter and indentify the regulatory elements associated with it. rapid amplification of cdna ends  with the total rna isolated from the h2o2-treated cells showed a distinct ~200-bp cdna product . sequence analysis of ~200-bp product identified the start of alr <dig> transcript to be 165-nt upstream of the translational start of the alr <dig> orf . bioinformatic analysis revealed the presence of a prokaryotic − <dig> and −35-like promoter sequence and a putative fura binding box within this promoter . electrophoretic mobility shift assays  showed the purified fura protein from anabaena pcc <dig> to bind the fura binding box .figure  <dig>

the alr <dig> promoter and its adjacent dna were cloned upstream of the gfp reporter gene in reporter vector, pam <dig>  and transferred into anabaena pcc <dig> . an4641prom was grown under nitrogen-fixing conditions and subjected to microscopic analysis. interestingly, along with the vegetative cells, gfp fluorescence was also observed in the heterocysts indicating that the alr <dig> promoter was active in heterocysts as well as in the vegetative cells . moreover, the alr <dig> protein was also detected in proteins extracted from heterocysts on western blots . expression of the alr <dig> protein was monitored in the wild-type anabaena cultures grown under nitrogen-supplemented or nitrogen-fixing conditions. no significant difference in the production of alr <dig> was observed  suggesting that the absence of combined nitrogen in the growth medium does not affect alr <dig> expression in anabaena.

oligomerization of alr <dig> is independent of cysteine residues
enhanced production of the alr <dig> protein in response to abiotic stresses and its localization in both heterocysts as well as vegetative cells suggested that alr <dig> could be an important player in detoxification of ros in anabaena. hence, we wished to characterize the biophysical and biochemical properties of the alr <dig> protein in order to gain insights into its function. analysis with the smart  or blast revealed the protein encoded by alr <dig> to be a typical 2-cys-prx containing the conserved vcp motif. the 612 bp long alr <dig> orf encoded a  <dig> kd  protein with the ahpc/tsa domain extending from the 13th amino acid to the 146th amino acid. analysis of the alr <dig> protein sequence showed the presence of ggvg and yf motifs that are typical of eukaryotic 2-cys-prx . based on homology with other peroxiredoxins, cysteines at position  <dig>  and  <dig>  of alr <dig> were speculated to be the putative peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues respectively .figure  <dig>

for functional characterization, the 2-cys peroxiredoxin protein  from anabaena was over-expressed in e. coli with n-terminal his-tag and purified near to homogeneity by affinity chromoatography . the putative peroxidatic  and resolving  cysteines of alr <dig> were individually mutated to serine by site-specific mutagenesis and the corresponding proteins  were purified to near homogeneity. gel filtration analysis revealed alr <dig> to elute in a fraction corresponding to decamer/dodecamer . native page analysis showed the wild-type alr <dig> as well as the mutants to be present as higher oligomers . these results suggest that peroxidatic and resolving cysteine residues are not involved in oligomer formation. on sds-page, the wild-type alr <dig> protein migrated as a monomer under reducing conditions , while in absence of dtt, a  <dig> kd protein, corresponding to its dimeric form was observed, indicating formation of inter subunit disulfide bond. electrophoretic separation showed both alr4641c56s and alr4641c178s to be present as monomers irrespective of the presence or absence of reducing agent  on sds page . tryptophan fluorescence spectra of the wild-type alr <dig>  alr4641c56s and alr4641c178s proteins showed no shift in peak position at 340 nm suggesting that the absence of cys residues does not alter the compactness of their structure . reduction of the wild-type alr <dig> did not alter the oligomeric state of the protein, but on treatment with h2o <dig>  few smaller oligomers along with the major higher oligomeric form were observed on native page . as the oligomeric state of alr <dig> remained unchanged, it was of particular interest to analyze the chaperone/peroxidase function of alr <dig> after exposure to oxidizing or reducing agents. results pertaining to these activities are described in the next two sections.

alr <dig> protein loses its chaperone function on reduction
the alr <dig> protein was assessed for its capability to function as a molecular chaperone employing the malate dehydrogenase  aggregation assay. at 55°c, the mdh protein showed substantial aggregation after 10 min whereas the purified alr <dig> protein by itself did not form any aggregates. when purified alr <dig> was added to mdh, a marked decrease in the scattering of light was observed indicating reduced aggregation of mdh. chaperone activity of alr <dig> was increased with increasing concentration of the protein  indicating that this protein did indeed function as a molecular chaperone . alr4641c56s and alr4641c178s both showed chaperone activity similar to the wild-type alr <dig> . alr <dig> treated with h2o <dig> retained chaperone activity, but interestingly, the alr <dig> protein on reduction with dithiothretol  failed to show this activity . however, when the dtt-reduced alr <dig> was treated with h2o <dig>  it regained its chaperone activity . cd spectropolarimetric analysis showed significant differences in the secondary structure of the reduced and the non-reduced wild-type alr <dig> suggesting that the oxidized and reduced forms were inherently different from each other .figure  <dig>

alr <dig> protects plasmid dna from oxidative damage and shows trx/ntrc-dependent peroxidase activity
metal catalyzed oxidation  was performed to verify if the purified alr <dig> protein could function as an antioxidant protein. the plasmid dna was completely degraded when subjected to mco assay in the absence of alr <dig>  however, addition of the alr <dig> protein protected the plasmid dna from degradation . the ability of alr <dig> to scavenge hydrogen peroxide with different electron donor systems  was evaluated. the alr <dig> protein could use trxa and dtt but not gsh to detoxify h2o <dig> . the purified alr <dig> protein showed trxa-dependent activity whereas both alr4641c56s and alr4641c178s failed to do so .figure  <dig>

the ntrc protein from anabaena was over-expressed in e. coli, purified by affinity chromatography . surface plasmon resonance  was employed to study interaction of alr <dig> with ntrc. the alr <dig> protein was immobilized on a bare gold sensor chip while ntrc was used in the mobile phase. the interaction between the two proteins was confirmed by a concentration-dependent increase in the spr signal . equilibrium analysis showed a good lorentz fit with the experimental values  and the equilibrium constant  was observed to be  <dig> x10−6 ±  <dig> x10−8 m. ntrc was also employed to evaluate the peroxidase activity of alr <dig> in the presence of different peroxidase substrates. among the three substrates tested, best activity was observed with h2o <dig> followed by t-butyl hydroperoxide and cumeme hydroperoxide . with increasing concentrations of h2o <dig>  a reduction in the peroxidase activity was observed, indicating that excess h2o <dig> inactivated the alr <dig> protein .

alr <dig> forms over-oxidized monomer in vivo under conditions of oxidative stress
the peroxidatic cysteine of 2-cys-prxs, on treatment with excess of oxidizing agents , becomes over-oxidized and is unable to form disulphide bridges. hence, the over-oxidized 2-cys-prx shows up as a monomer on non-reducing sds-polyacrylamide gels  <cit> . to analyze the formation of over-oxidized monomers in vivo in anabaena during oxidative stress, cells were treated with different oxidizing agents and analyzed . treatment with h2o <dig> but not methyl viologen produced detectable alr <dig> monomers, whereas at the concentration of t-butyl hydroperoxide  employed, partial over-oxidation of alr <dig> occurred and both monomeric as well as dimeric forms of the protein were observed . exposure of anabaena to 6 kgy dose of gamma radiation also resulted in the formation of the alr <dig> monomers . however, the over-oxidized form disappeared during recovery and 24 h after irradiation, only the dimeric form of alr <dig> was observed .figure  <dig>

over-expression of alr <dig>  but not alr4641c56s, causes reduction in intracellular ros generation on exposure to h2o2
to assess the in vivo role of catalytic cysteine , the wild-type alr <dig> or alr4641c56s were individually cloned between the strong light inducible psba promoter  and the gfp  gene in pam <dig> . both these constructs were separately transferred to anabaena pcc <dig>  under fluorescence microscope, the filaments of an4641+  and anc56s+  appeared green indicating the presence of pam <dig> or pam4641c56s . when probed with the anti-alr <dig> antiserum, abundant production of the alr <dig> or alr4641c56s protein was observed in the cell-free extract of an4641+ or anc56s+ respectively . when analyzed on non-reducing sds-page, the wild-type alr <dig> was mostly present in its dimeric form whereas alr4641c56s remained largely monomeric . native page followed by western blot analysis with cell free extracts of an4641+/anc56s+revealed the occurrence of higher oligomeric form in vivo in both the cases  as also observed with the purified proteins .figure  <dig>

earlier, the ntrc protein was shown to physically interact with the purified alr <dig> protein . in addition, capability of ntrc to associate with the alr <dig> protein from an4641+ cells free extracts was assessed by pull down experiments. as shown in figure 7f, substantial amount of alr <dig> was bound when ntrc was immobilized on ninta agarose. in the absence of ntrc, hardly any alr <dig> bound to the empty resin .

the intracellular levels of ros in the wild-type anabaena, an4641+ or anc56s+ cells exposed to h2o <dig> for 1 h were assessed with the fluorogenic probe dchfda. under control conditions, ros levels were very low in all types of cells. however, on exposure to 1 mm h2o <dig>  substantially higher levels of ros were observed in the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> and anc56s+ cells as compared to the an4641+ cells .

over-production of alr <dig> protects the photosynthetic machinery and enhances survival in response to oxidative stress in anabaena
treatment with 1 mm h2o <dig> for 24 h resulted in pronounced bleaching caused by a sharp reduction in the chlorophyll a content in the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> but not in an4641+ cells . a substantial decline was observed in fv/fm of h2o2-stressed wild-type anabaena cells, while an4641+ showed fv/fm comparable to the unstressed control cells . light curves  of electron transport rate  with the wild-type anabaena or an4641+ were carried out to analyze electron transport rate in psii in response to h2o <dig>  the etr  of an4641+ on treatment with h2o <dig> was similar to that of control cells. in contrast, a severe decrease in etr  was observed when the wild-type anabaena was treated with h2o <dig> . rate of co <dig> fixation decreased marginally in the an4641+ treated with h2o <dig> as compared to a 20-fold reduction observed in the similarly treated wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> . the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> treated with h2o <dig> failed to grow on bg- <dig> plates indicating loss in viability. on the other hand, similarly treated an4641+ grew on plates like the unstressed control cells .figure  <dig>

discussion
prxs form a phylogenetically ancient group of enzymes with a major role in detoxification of peroxides  <cit> . generally, prxs show a moderate catalytic activity, but their high cellular content seems to compensate for their reduced efficiency in decomposing peroxides  <cit> . it is believed that the antioxidant system in chloroplasts, organelle with highest content of prxs in a plant cell, has evolved from cyanobacteria. anabaena bears a resemblance to plant chloroplasts in being equipped with an oxidation sensitive 2-cys-prx  along with its reducing partner ntrc  <cit>  and showing a low catalase activity  <cit> .

the presence of the  <dig> -knt alr <dig> transcript  indicates that in spite of their adjacent location, the alr <dig> orf  and alr <dig> are not co-transcribed, signifying that alr <dig> forms a monocistronic operon. the promoter sequence found immediately upstream of this start site showed the presence of fura  binding site  and the purified fura protein from anabaena bound the dna fragment containing this sequence . gonzalez et al. have shown production of the alr <dig> protein to be reduced in the fura-overexpressing anabaena pcc <dig>  all these results imply that fura regulates transcription of alr <dig> in anabaena  <cit> .

in response to different abiotic stresses, the 2-cys-prx gene transcript was enhanced in synechococcus pcc <dig> but not synechocystis pcc <dig> suggesting that transcriptional induction of 2-cys-prx differs among cyanobacteria  <cit> . in anabaena, along with methyl viologen and h2o <dig>  gamma radiation  could also enhance production of the alr <dig> transcript or the alr <dig> protein   <cit> . interestingly, salinity as well as osmotic stress also increased production of the alr <dig> protein , indicating that alr <dig> may be a multiple stress induced protein. this is not unusual as several environmental stresses  generate ros  <cit> , which in turn may ultimately enhance production of the alr <dig> protein.

employing pull down assay and spr analysis, ntrc was shown to physically interact with alr <dig>  suggesting that ntrc is likely to be the physiological reductant of alr <dig> in anabaena. in vivo, on treatment with h2o <dig>  the recombinant anc56s+ strain  showed higher ros levels compared to the an4641+ strain  . this underscores the importance of peroxidatic cysteine of alr <dig> for detoxification of h2o2in vivo in anabaena.

in general, the purified 2-cys-prx isolated from different organisms co-exists in various forms i.e. dimeric, decameric and high molecular wt. complexes  <cit> . in contrast, in its native form, alr <dig> as well as its cysteine mutants appeared as decamers in vitro,  or in vivo . moreover, irrespective of the redox state , alr <dig> appeared as decamer  indicating that the disulfide bonds are not involved in oligomerization.

generally, along with conformational change, the oligomeric state of 2-cys prx has also been linked to its dynamic redox state, which in turn determines its function  <cit> . chaperone activity of 2-cys-prx has been generally linked to their oligomerization state  <cit> . the higher molecular weight complex shows chaperone function, the dimeric form mostly functions as a peroxidase, whereas the decameric form shows both these activities  <cit> . although, reduction of alr <dig> with dtt did not change its oligomeric nature, its chaperone activity was severely reduced . loss of chaperone function was observed on reducing alr4641c56s and alr4641c178s too , suggesting that reduction in chaperone activity was not due to disruption of disulphide bonds. in contrast, treatment with h2o <dig> did not affect the chaperone activity of alr <dig>  whereas a substantial loss in peroxidase activity was observed . apparently, chaperone/peroxidase activity of alr <dig> does not depend on its oligomeric status, but is decided by the redox state of the protein i.e. the reduced form is more likely to function as a peroxidase while the oxidized form is more liable to function as a chaperone. a model depicting the above phenomena is described in the figure  <dig>  although, thought to be a specific disulphide bond reducing agent, dtt is known to affect function of proteins not containing any cysteine residues  <cit> , and it is proposed that dtt may act as a general reducing agent that causes changes in the global structure of proteins  <cit> . reduction of 2-cys-prx from arabidopsis with dtt also resulted in altered secondary structure  <cit> . in this study too, a distinct difference in the cd spectra of reduced and non-reduced alr <dig> was observed , indicating that treatment with dtt causes a change in the secondary structure.figure  <dig> 
a model depicting redox-dependent functional switching of alr <dig>  rectangular box in the lower panel represents the oligomeric  structure of alr <dig> while the upper panel shows the state of catalytic cysteine residues of the individual monomeric units. various conformational forms of the alr <dig> protein i.e. dtt-reduced decamer , reduced decamer , oxidized decamer  and over-oxidized decamer  are shown in the figure. alr <dig> exists as decamer irrespective of its redox state or disulphide linkage status) in all the above-mentioned conformations. monomeric units corresponding to various forms are depicted as follows: form-a, white circle; form-b and form-c, light-grey oval and form-d, dark-gray oval. form-b  on oxidation with h2o <dig> forms inter-molecular disulfide bonds , resulting in the formation of oxidized decamer . form-b is regenerated from form-c by electron donors like trx and ntrc. however, with excess h2o <dig>  the cysteinyl residue of the peroxidatic cysteine of form-b is over-oxidised to sulfinic/sulfonic acid . reduction of alr <dig> with dtt not only results in the loss of disulfide bonds but also changes the overall structure of the protein . form-b, form-c and form-d show chaperone activity , but form-a fails to show this activity. on the other hand, form-a, form-b and form-c function as peroxidase , whereas the over-oxidized alr <dig> i.e. form-d is unable to do so. to summarize, under reducing conditions, alr <dig> is more likely to function as a peroxidase, whereas under oxidizing surroundings, it is more likely to work as a chaperone.



excess h2o <dig> over-oxidizes the peroxidatic cysteine, rendering alr <dig> incapable of peroxidase activity  <cit> . interestingly, high dose of γ-radiation could also over-oxidize the 2-cys-prx  preventing the formation of disulfide bond. post irradiation, on sds page, the monomeric form of alr <dig> disappeared and only the dimeric form could be seen after  <dig> h, indicating the reversion of the over-oxidised alr4641protein to its normal form . it is suggested that the recovery of the over-oxidized alr <dig> is facilitated by the sulfiredoxin  protein, which reverses the over-oxidation in vivo  <cit> .

in anabaena, depletion of combined nitrogen from medium leads to formation of heterocysts, the specialized cells that fix nitrogen  <cit> . it should be noted that in spite of lowered o <dig> content, ros are generated by photosystem i  and respiratory electron transport in heterocysts  <cit> . also, when the ratio of nitrogenase reductase to o <dig> is greater than  <dig>  nitrogenase reductase reduces oxygen to h2o <dig> without being inactivated by oxygen  <cit> . thus the h2o <dig> produced in heterocysts has to be removed promptly. prxs are known to be differentially distributed among the vegetative cells and heterocysts  <cit>  and among the four prxq-like proteins  from anabaena, only alr <dig> was detected in heterocysts  <cit> . in our study, promoter activity  as well the alr <dig> protein was observed in heterocysts as well as vegetative cells , indicating that it may play a role in detoxifying peroxides in vegetative cells and heterocysts.

hydrogen peroxide  is a commonly occurring reactive oxygen species  in biological systems and cyanobacteria have been shown to be generally more sensitive to h2o <dig> than other phototrophs  <cit> . as anabaena pcc <dig> does not show good catalase activity  <cit> , it is suggested that prxs may be the principal components that detoxify h2o <dig> in this organism. h2o <dig> damages photosynthetic apparatus and severely affects fv/fm in several cyanobacteria  <cit> . in the cyanobacterium microcystis aeruginosa, treatment with h2o <dig> enhanced reactive oxygen species  accumulation, which caused destruction of pigment synthesis and led to cell death  <cit> . treatment of the wild-type anabaena pcc <dig> with h2o <dig> caused  enhanced levels of ros  decrease in photosynthetic activities and  loss in viability . however, all the above-mentioned deleterious effects were alleviated in an4641+ strain, indicating that alr <dig> can protect anabaena from oxidative stress.

CONCLUSIONS
the present study has identified alr <dig> as an abiotic stress induced protein that plays an important role in protecting anabaena from oxidative stress. the alr <dig> protein was found to be unique from the other reported 2-cys-prxs i.e. the redox state and not its oligomerization status dictated the functional switch between the peroxidase or chaperone activity of this protein. key attributes of alr <dig> like dual function, inherent transcriptional/translational induction under different stresses, localization in both vegetative cells and heterocysts, ability to use various reducing agents for detoxifying peroxides, reflect the versatile role played by the protein in anabaena. the recombinant anabaena strain over expressing alr <dig> exhibited higher tolerance to oxidative stress, thus establishing its potential to serve as stress-tolerant biofertilizers in paddy fields.
