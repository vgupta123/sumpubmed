BACKGROUND
tumour metastasis is a multistage process in which malignant cells spread from the initial tumour to colonize the same or distant organs  <cit> . sequential events during metastasis involve local invasion, intravasation, and survival in the circularization, extravasation and colonization of the host organ. an important variable is the temporal course of metastasis. whereas breast cancer recurrences are often detected following decades of remission, lung cancers establish distant metastases within months of diagnosis  <cit> . apparently, the capacity of cancer cells to infiltrate distinct organs and to develop macrometastases does not coincide. it is hypothesized, that during this period of metastatic latency disseminated cancer cells acquire the ability to colonize the host organ  <cit> . among other factors like immunosurveillance, switches of transcriptional pathways and programmes, the local microenvironment is considered a critical determinant of metastatic outgrowth. during the latency period a local malignant evolution of the disseminated cancer cell and/or the seeded microenvironment might be required for effective colonization and metastatic outgrowth. to date dissemination and metastatic outgrowth has mainly been attributed to clonally derived cancer cells. even in advanced genetically heterogeneous primary tumors metastases appear to be of clonal origin  <cit> , although concepts of interclonal cooperativity have been considered and tested in model systems  <cit> .

in a recent report,  <cit>  massive parallel dna sequence analysis revealed statistical evidence for the multiclonal origin of breast cancer metastases. by comparison of the mutation spectrum of a breast cancer patient’s primary and secondary tumors, the prevalence of specific mutations was found significantly decreased or increased relative to the primary tumor. it was suggested that the patient’s metastases have been formed by at least three different cell clones.

we have chosen three recently described  <cit>  novel cell lines established from a metastatic midgut  neuroendocrine tumor  of the same patient together with the corresponding original tissue samples: 1) p-sts, a cell line established from the primary tumor , 2) l-sts, from a lymph node metastasis, and 3) h-sts, a cell line established from a liver metastasis, to screen for mutations in the p-tu and to explore the evolution of somatic mutations and corresponding cell population kinetics during in vitro cultivation.

RESULTS
targeted resequencing
using the hg <dig> reference sequence  we have designed a custom sequence capture array  including  <dig>  exons from  <dig> cancer associated genes based on the information available via the cancer gene census   <cit>  and  <dig> collagen genes, comprising a total of  <dig>  mb of genomic information for enrichment and subsequent  <dig> gs flx titanium based parallel re-sequencing . primarily, only cancer-associated genes known for and characterised by missense mutations, stop-mutations, small and large in/del mutations as well as frame-shift mutations were included in the design of the capture array.

sequencing of ~  <dig> mb of target-enriched genomic information per sample  was sufficient to achieve an average of > 25-fold coverage of the target region. 63-79% of the reads mapped to the target region with > 80% of target bases covered at least 5-fold .  <dig>  high-confidence sequence variants were detected for the p-tu sample using the standard gs reference mapper tool , with  <dig>  of these representing known variants.  <dig> variants were detected within the exonic sequences.  <dig> of these variants were novel;  <dig> thereof non-synonymous. . we could identify four genes  with known mutations observed in all samples as can be seen in the venn diagram . the fraction of non-synonymous to synonymous sequence variants among the newly identified variants was disproportionately higher  compared to the ratio within the known variants  indicating a substantial fraction of these variants to be of somatic origin. although all samples were sequenced to approximately the same coverage, the l-sts p <dig> and h-sts p <dig> cell lines lacked the variants identified in the p-tu and did not show sample specific variants . a high level of sequence capture efficiency and reproducibility among the processed samples is shown for a representative locus .

sanger sequencing of brca <dig>  ctnnb <dig>  ercc <dig>  hnf1a, kit, mll, rb <dig>  ros <dig>  and smad4
six of the novel heterozygous missense variants  and three frameshift sequence variants of rb <dig>  hnf1a and ctnnb <dig> identified in the p-tu sample were selected for further investigation . none of these mutations was detectable in blood derived dna of the same patient by sanger sequencing proving the somatic origin of the mutations. all variants were heterozygous and detectable in both metastases  and the corresponding cell lines h-sts  and p-sts  at lower passages  whereas the l-sts at passage  <dig> has already lost the mutant alleles and displayed only reference/wild-type allele information  for all nine investigated markers. none of these sequence variants initially detected in the p-tu tissue and in cell line p-sts was found in the metastasis derived cell lines l-sts and h-sts at higher passages .

high-resolution melting curve analysis
to evaluate, whether the sequence variants might still occur albeit at lower frequency eventually in form of a minor  cell population, we implemented high-resolution melting curve analysis for mll  and rb <dig> . using mutation specific hrm assays with a 10% minor variant detection limit, we confirmed heterozygosity of the variants in the p-tu sample as well as the higher passages of p-sts sample and the absence of a ≥ 10% subpopulation in the l-sts p <dig> and h-sts p <dig> cell lines .

sequencing of tp <dig> variants
two tp <dig> sequence variants  were identified in the p-tu sample, whereas the data from the p-sts p <dig> indicated homozygous mutant tp <dig> sequence information . the tp <dig> c.c817t mutant was not detectable in l-sts p <dig> and h-sts p <dig> by next-generation sequencing, revealing only wild-type sequence reads. the known tp <dig> snp rs <dig> was confirmed heterozygous in the blood dna sample, whereas the c.c817t mutation was not detectable in this reference dna, validating the somatic origin of the known tp <dig> mutation. accordingly, sanger sequencing confirmed heterozygosity for both tp <dig> sequence variants in the p-tu and the metastatic tissues . as observed for the previously described gene panel, h-sts p <dig> and l-sts p <dig> cell lines exhibited a loss of the mutant allele information at higher passages and in h-sts p <dig>  in contrast, p-sts p <dig> exclusively exhibited the tp <dig> sequence variant at higher passages, which was a result of a copy neutral loss of heterozygosity after passage  <dig>  as determined by complementary methods . complete submission sra055939; ptu srr521279; hsts srr521655; psts srr521658; lsts srr <dig> 

chromosomal copy number  analysis using affymetrix  <dig>  cnv/snp arrays
to evaluate, whether chromosomal imbalances  might have contributed to the selective loss of the variant alleles we performed copy number  and genotype analysis using affymetrix  <dig> cnv/snp arrays . we did not observe any cn alterations for the l-sts p <dig> and the h-sts p <dig> cell lines. the primary net  displayed a single copy neutral loh at chr.3: p <dig> -p <dig> , whereas the p-sts p <dig> showed gain of chromosome arms 1p and 17q-p <dig> and loss of 3p <dig> -p <dig> , 4q <dig> -qter, 11q <dig> -q <dig>  and 20p13-p <dig>  . both metastases tissues  displayed the same copy neutral loh at chr. <dig> as the p-tu, without the indication of further chromosomal alterations. cn data are summarized in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in-depth analysis of the cn probes and genotypes at the genetic loci of brca <dig>  ercc <dig>  kit, mll, smad <dig>  ros <dig>  rb <dig>  tp <dig> and hnf1a revealed unchanged cn  with interspersed heterozygous genotypes . in contrast, the expected loss-of-heterozygosity  at the tp <dig> locus of the p-sts sample turned out to be a copy number neutral loh, resulting from an early loss of the wild-type allele followed by re-duplication of the mutant allele  .

immunofluorescence analysis for serotonin  on a confocal scanning microscope
immunocytochemical characterization in former studies  <cit>  showed an expression of pancytokeratin, cytokeratins  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  serotonin , nse, cd <dig>  protein gene product  <dig>  , calcitonin, synaptophysin, and gastrin-releasing factor in the p-sts cell line. the l-sts cell line was characterized for positive immunoreactivity with cytokeratin 8/ <dig>  and pgp  <dig> . the h-sts cell line showed a positive immunocytochemical reactivity for chomogranin , serotonin , pgp <dig>  and ck8/ <dig>  the net cell status at higher cell passages was confirmed by immunodetection of serotonin expression by confocal laser scanning microscopy . furthermore, unspecific binding was excluded by preadsorption with  <dig> mm serotonin creatinine sulphate complex which resulted in a suppression of the staining .

discussion
while chromosomal aberrations are frequently found in midgut nets  <cit> , reports on the observation of frequent gene mutations  are rare. by virtue of sequence capture based high-throughput sequencing targeting  <dig> known cancer associated genes; we have identified multiple de-novo somatic mutations in a primary midgut net . mutations affect genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle , apoptosis, senescence and dna repair , transcriptional regulation  and cell signalling . whereas these tumor-specific mutations were conserved in the patient’s lymph node- and liver metastases, the heterozygous sequence variants were lost in metastases derived cell lines , indicating a lack of selective pressure to maintain the mutations  during in vitro-cultivation. notwithstanding several prominent mutations in the dna repair genes, no increase in the number of mutations or cnvs was observed in the l-sts and h-sts, whereas the p-sts acquired multiple chromosomal alterations during in vitro cultivation not evident in the p-tu.

the only chromosomal alteration observed for the p-tu and the metastases is a copy neutral loh on chromosome 3p21-p <dig>  among the dna mismatch repair gene mlh <dig>  and the dna repair gene xpc , which is frequently found mutated in xeroderma pigmentosum syndrome type c  <cit> , this locus contains the vhl  tumor suppressor gene. germline mutations of vhl have been reported in patients with the von hippel-lindau disease, a familial cancer syndrome. all three genes were covered by the sequence capture array and sequenced to sufficient depth to identify eventually occurring variants in coding sequences. nonetheless, no exonic sequence variants were observed for these genes, although any variants affecting gene regulatory regions might be missed by our enrichment approach.

the p-sts cell line acquired several aberrations frequently observed in lung and midgut nets   <cit> . reduplication of one parental allele coinciding with loss of the other allele inevitably leads to a copy neutral loh indicated by homozygosity and a cn of  <dig> at the respective region. we observed this event at the tp <dig> locus  during passaging of the p-sts cell line. it has been shown in a previous study that tumorigenicity of both metastases derived cell lines  in scid mice was substantially decreased compared to the p-sts p <dig>  cell line  <cit> . poor survival and increased aggressiveness in lung net patients have been attributed to mutations in the tp <dig> gene  <cit> , which might be mirrored by the differing tumorigenicity of the cell lines in scid mice and the concordant bi-allelic deletion of tp <dig> in the p-sts cell line.

heterozygosity at the brca <dig>  ctnnb <dig>  mll, smad <dig>  ercc <dig>  rb <dig> and kit chromosomal loci and a cn of  <dig> indicate that another mechanism must have lead to the loss of the mutations during in vitro cultivation. maintenance of serotonin expression in the l-sts and the h-sts throughout cell passaging proves a classical net characteristic  <cit>  of the cell lines. it is highly unlikely that all the dna alterations observed in the primary tissues were selectively repaired during in vitro cell expansion almost in parallel  and indepently in both cell lines . we presume that a minor net cell population bearing none of the mutant alleles, which must have already been present during metastasis, has overgrown and replaced the initially dominating mutant h-sts and l-sts cell lines in parallel. this hypothesis implies the intriguing fact that metastasis formation and/or outgrowth must have involved a multiclonal complex comprising at least two different net cell populations. this could have happened in two ways, either by dissemination of a multicellular complex consisting of at least two genotypically different net subclones or by a stepwise process where the newly established metastasis has attracted other circulating tumor cells to associate. it is likely that the reported different tumorigenic properties in scid mice are directly linked their genomic alterations. additionally, the parallel finding of metastatic bi-clonality might indicate commensal biological tasks during metastases formation. various biological effects might underlie this interdependence. a non-mutant  tumor cell population will be less immunogenic thereby protecting early metastatic outgrowth. functional studies deploying mixtures of clonally expanded metastases and/or primary tumor derived subpopulations in immunodeficient mice might be suited to further investigate the biological principles in an appropriate environment.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, we demonstrate the bi-clonal origin of two metastases of a net patient using dna-enrichment followed by massive parallel resequencing and based on in-vitro selection identify and genetically characterize the clonal partners. in our discussion, we propose a model of clonal interdependence during metastases formation as the underlying biological mechanism. nevertheless, interclonal dependence during metastasis formation might offer another avenue for the development of anti-cancer strategies.
