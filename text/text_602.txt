BACKGROUND
burkholderia pseudomallei is a gram-negative bacillus and the causative agent of melioidosis, a severe disease endemic in southeast asia and northern australia  <cit> . the organism is an environmental saprophyte found in soil and water. it infects humans and animals mostly by direct contact with wet soil  <cit> . the incidence of melioidosis is high in northeastern thailand, where saline soil and water are abundant  <cit> . the salt concentration in soil in this region ranges from  <dig> to  <dig>  mm nacl – significantly higher than the 20 mm nacl average in other parts of the country . it has been suggested that high salt or osmotic stress in northeast thailand may be a key factor for b. pseudomallei alteration for survival in the natural environment, and it may enable the bacteria to establish the infection in respective hosts. the relationship between high salt concentration and susceptibility to bacterial infection is described in cystic fibrosis  patients  <cit> . the lung airway surface liquid of cf sufferers has twice the nacl concentration of healthy lungs  <cit> . opportunistic infections of cf lungs have been linked with a variety of pathogens, including b. cepacia complex  <cit>  and b. pseudomallei <cit> . however, the impact of salt and osmotic stress on b. pseudomallei and the related mechanisms underlying b. pseudomallei pathogenesis in cf patients are unknown.

an earlier study demonstrated that the killing efficiency of burkholderia species, including b. pseudomallei, against the nematode caenorhabditis elegans is enhanced in condition containing 300 mm nacl  <cit> . we also showed that b. pseudomallei grown under salt stress invades a lung epithelial cell line a <dig>  <cit>  more efficiently, and exhibits significantly greater resistance to ceftazidime, an antibiotic used to treat melioidosis  <cit> . our transcriptional analysis revealed b. pseudomallei pre-exposed to salt stress up-regulates a 10-fold increase of a gene associated with short-chain dehydrogenase/oxidoreductase   <cit> . a different study by bhatt & weingart  <cit>  also showed that an oxidoreductase encoding gene  was up-regulated in b. cenocepacia in response to increased nacl concentrations. however, the role of sdo for b. pseudomallei adaptation to osmotic or salt stress remains unknown.

in the present study, we analyzed the protein sequence and predicted structure of b. pseudomallei sdo using bioinformatics analysis, to provide information about the possible functions of sdo. we further investigated its functional roles by constructing a sdo deletion mutant strain, and examined the interaction between mutant and host cells. the results suggest that sdo is an adaptive determinant of b. pseudomallei virulence, which is up-regulated under salt stress, and has a significant role in the interaction with host cells.

RESULTS
bioinformatics analysis of b. pseudomallei sdo
a sdo amino-acid  sequence of b. pseudomallei strain k <dig> was retrieved from genbank . it was composed of  <dig> aa with a calculated molecular weight of  <dig>  dalton. blast  <cit>  sequence analysis  <cit>  revealed that b. pseudomallei sdo was categorized into short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases , which shared a 24% amino-acid sequence identity with bacillus megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase  . therefore, the swiss-model  <cit>  was used to construct a structural model of b. pseudomallei sdo, using b. megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase as a template for homology modeling. the resulting model was validated by procheck  <cit> . the structural model of b. pseudomallei sdo revealed a catalytic triad active site, consisting of ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  and lys <dig>  together with a nad+ cofactor domain . this suggests that the sdo of b. pseudomallei may have an enzymatic function similar to b. megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase.

among available genomes of burkholderia spp., blast analysis demonstrated that all species harbor the sdo protein. the amino-acid identities of pathogenic b. pseudomallei, b. mallei, b. oklahomensis, b. multivorans, b. vietnamiensis, and b. cenocepacia range from 83% to 100%, whereas those of non-pathogenic b. thailandensis are less than 36%. the high identity among pathogenic strains might indicate a common pathogenesis that is mediated by burkholderia sdo.

mutagenesis of b. pseudomallei sdo mutant
to identify the function of sdo in b. pseudomallei, we constructed a mutant defective in sdo production using a pexkm5-based allele replacement system  <cit> . pcr analysis using primers flanking deleted alleles confirmed the deletion of the sdo gene on the b. pseudomallei chromosome . as expected, a 566 bp dna fragment was detected in the sdo mutant, whereas a  <dig>  bp dna fragment was detected in the wild type k <dig>  indicating a homologous recombination by deletion of 631 bp of the sdo gene on the chromosome of the b. pseudomallei mutant. b. pseudomallei sdo complement strain was constructed using the same strategy. the amplified product of the complemented strain showed the presence of a  <dig>  bp dna fragment, as observed in the parental strain. pcr analysis of a 236 bp orit fragment demonstrated an extinction of pexkm <dig> plasmid backbone in both the mutant and complement strains.

the pexkm <dig> plasmid was removed from the sdo mutant and the complement strains by sucrose selection. absence of a 236 bp orit amplicon indicated the removal of pexkm <dig> plasmid from the chromosome of the b. pseudomallei sdo mutant and the complement strains.

b. pseudomallei sdo exhibits gdh activity under salt stress
b. pseudomallei is known to up-regulate sdo in high salt condition  <cit> . the structural model of b. pseudomallei sdo indicates a catalytic triad and cofactor binding domain, similar to the structure of b. megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase. this is highly specific to beta-d-glucose and is capable of using either nad+ or nadp+ as a cofactor  <cit> . we hypothesized that the glucose dehydrogenase activity of b. pseudomallei sdo might be similar to b. megaterium. we determined the gdh activity of b. pseudomallei sdo in wild type and sdo mutant strains grown in lb broth containing 0–300 mm nacl. the results showed that b. pseudomallei wild type exhibited strong gdh activity under high salinity at 300 mm nacl, whereas the activity of b. pseudomallei was comparable in salt-free and 150 mm nacl . this correlated with previous finding that suggested b. pseudomallei sdo transcription was enhanced by salt stress  <cit> .

it was also evident that the gdh activity of sdo mutant was impaired under high salt concentration condition containing 300 mm nacl , which was 15-fold lower than the wild type . the sdo complement strain was able to recover sdo mutant gdh activity . the data suggested that high salt concentration is associated with induction of sdo-dependent gdh activity in b. pseudomallei.

sdo plays a role in host interaction of b. pseudomallei
the ability of b. pseudomallei to invade and survive in host cells is an important process that contributes to the pathogenesis of melioidosis. invasion of b. pseudomallei has been reported as being induced by exogenous salt  <cit> , and previous study indicated that high salt concentration increases the expression of sdo  <cit> . we thus investigated whether sdo affects the invasion of b. pseudomallei into a <dig> human lung respiratory epithelial cells. we found that invasion efficiency into a <dig> cells was significantly reduced in the b. pseudomallei sdo mutant, compared to the wild type  . the invasion efficiency of the b. pseudomallei mutant grown in lb broth containing  <dig>   <dig>  and 300 mm nacl was less than 5%, in contrast to that of wild type bacteria . while the mutant had less invasion efficiency, the result clearly demonstrated that increasing salt concentration from  <dig> to  <dig> or 300 mm nacl led to significantly improved invasion of b. pseudomallei mutant into a <dig> cells as it is observed for the wild type strain .

the ability of b. pseudomallei to survive and replicate intracellularly may be attributable to the successful evasion of cellular killing strategies. we next examined the intracellular survival of the b. pseudomallei wild type and the sdo mutant within macrophages. the macrophage cells were chosen for this experiment because b. pseudomallei can be uptaken and multiply within these cells, and resist their bactericidal response  <cit> . the mutant showed fewer intracellular bacteria within the j774a. <dig> macrophage cell line during the initial stages of infection – up to 6 hrs  . the intracellular doubling time of the b. pseudomallei sdo mutant pre-exposure to  <dig>   <dig>  and 300 mm nacl was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> %. in contrast, the doubling time of the wild type bacteria was  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> , and  <dig>  ±  <dig> % in lb with  <dig>   <dig>  and 300 mm nacl. the sdo complement strain recovered the growth of the sdo mutant with a rate similar to the wild type at an early time. our data suggests that sdo plays an important role during the early phase of b. pseudomallei infection. it is possible the mutagenesis of sdo impaired the invasion of b. pseudomallei into a <dig> epithelial cells, and delayed initial multiplication within j774a. <dig> macrophage cells.

sdo is not essential for b. pseudomallei growth and colony morphotype
some dehydrogenases are critical for the growth characteristic of bacteria  <cit> . we investigated the effect of sdo deletion on the growth of b. pseudomallei. growth of the wild type k <dig> and the sdo mutant was compared in luria-bertani  medium, containing various concentrations of nacl . we observed that the growth kinetics of the b. pseudomallei k <dig> and the sdo mutant were comparable . the culture condition containing 450 mm nacl impaired the growth of both strains. variations in colony morphology are a notable feature of b. pseudomallei growth, where certain types are associated with enhanced bacterial survival under adverse conditions  <cit> . we also examined the effect of sdo on colony morphotype switching in the b. pseudomallei k <dig> and the sdo mutant on ashdown agar. the results indicated no phenotypic change of colony morphology between the wild type k <dig> and the mutant. both were categorized as colony morphotype i  <cit>  . these results indicated that sdo deletion does not affect b. pseudomallei colony morphology and bacterial growth.

sdo is not required for b. pseudomallei survival under oxidative stress
many reports suggested that dehydrogenases are associated with the bacterial protection against toxic oxidants  <cit> . we examined the role of sdo for survival of b. pseudomallei under different oxidative stress conditions. salt-treated and untreated b. pseudomallei wild type and sdo mutant strains were cultured on lb agar plates containing 250 μm h2o <dig>  400 μm menadione, or 200 μm tert-butyl hydroperoxide , and their survival were determined . the result showed that there are no significant differences in survival between the b. pseudomallei wild type and the sdo mutant strains, neither in salt-treated or untreated conditions. this indicates that sdo might not be essential for adaptation and growth of b. pseudomallei in these oxidative stress environments.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
b. pseudomallei is a saprophyte bacterium habitats in environments in endemic area, including northeast thailand  <cit>  where saline salt and water are abundant. in normal physiological conditions, the nacl concentration in the human lung is between  <dig> to 100 mm, and in the blood it can be as high as 150 mm  <cit> . in cf patients, the defective lung airway surface liquid has twice the nacl concentration compared to healthy lungs  <cit> . it has been reported that elevated salt levels causes failure of bacterial killing in cf patients  <cit> . the opportunistic infection of cf lungs is linked to a variety of pathogens, including b. pseudomallei <cit> . there is increasing evidence suggesting that salt concentration or osmolarity in a habitat influences the survival and pathogenicity of b. pseudomallei <cit> . thus, understanding the effect of salt stress is beneficial not only for environmental adaptation but also pathogenesis of the disease.

to survive in a high salt environment, the bacteria can undergo adaptation by altering the regulation of gene expression. using transcriptomic analysis, we recently discovered that b. pseudomallei responds to salt stress by modulating the transcription of specific genes  <cit> . among these are several loci associated with unknown functions, which need to be identified. changes of b. pseudomallei transcriptome under salt stress include increasing expression of sdo  <cit> . the sdo is an enzyme in the short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases/oxidoreductase family that catalyzes the following chemical reaction: d-glucose + nad+ = d-glucono- <dig> -lactone + nadh + h+. both nadp+ and nad+ are usually utilized as cofactors  <cit> . this study revealed the importance of sdo expression during salt-stress adaptation. based on the structural model of b. pseudomallei sdo, which consists of a nad+ cofactor domain and catalytic triad containing ser <dig>  tyr <dig>  and lys <dig> similar to bacillus megaterium glucose 1-dehydrogenase, we hypothesized that b. pseudomallei sdo has gdh activity. to examine the function of b. pseudomallei sdo, a mutant strain lacking sdo was constructed using a gene replacement strategy, a method that rarely has a polar effect on downstream genes  <cit> . in contrast to the wild type, it is clear that the b. pseudomallei sdo mutant was unable to produce gdh activity under high salt concentration. this finding is consistent with our previous observation of transcriptome profiling that b. pseudomallei grown in lb broth with 320 mm nacl induced a 10-fold up-regulation of the sdo gene  <cit> . since the mutant lost the gene encoding for functional sdo enzyme, it was thus unable to catalyze the reaction.

several studies indicate that dehydrogenase enzymes are critical for bacterial growth. for instance, brown & whiteley  <cit>  have shown that the gene aa <dig> , encoded for an nad+-independent l-lactate dehydrogenase, is necessary for the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. inactivation of the aa <dig> gene affects the growth of the bacteria in the presence of l-lactate. another study showed that mutations of the nuo gene encoding for nadh dehydrogenase i affected e. coli growth during the stationary phase culture in tryptone broth  <cit> . in our current study, we found that the b. pseudomallei mutant lacking sdo had growth kinetics and colony phenotypes similar to the b. pseudomallei wild type. at various salt concentrations, there was no significant difference in growth between both b. pseudomallei strains. it indicated that deletion of the sdo gene has no effect on b. pseudomallei growth. this result is in agreement with previous observations identified by microarray analysis – the sdo gene is not in a group of growth-phase regulated genes  <cit> .

the association between dehydrogenase enzymes and bacterial pathogenesis has been reported in several studies  <cit> . the alcohol acetaldehyde dehydrogenase , also known as listeria adhesion protein, which is present in pathogenic listeria species, mediates pathogenicity by promoting bacterial adhesion to enterocyte-like caco- <dig> cells  <cit> . it was shown that both lipoamide dehydrogenase “lpd”, a member of three multienzyme complexes in pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and 3-ketosteroid 1-dehydrogenase are important for virulence of mycobacterium tuberculosis <cit> . in pseudomonas aeruginosa, the sdo attenuated mutant had significantly reduced pyocyanin production, motility, and biofilm formation, as well as absent paralysis of c. elegans <cit> . consistent with these reports, our study shows that defective sdo is associated with a reduced efficiency of the mutant to invade into a <dig> lung epithelial cells. furthermore, we observed that the invasion of the b. pseudomallei sdo mutant was enhanced by increasing concentration of nacl to  <dig> or 300 mm. compared to the wild type, the sdo mutant exhibited fewer invasions and subsequently revealed less replication at early infection time point, but at 8 hrs after infection the mutant was able to multiply in j774a. <dig> macrophage cells. the results suggest that the sdo gene might be induced only upon bacterial invasion of macrophage. it should be noted that b. pseudomallei grown under high salt conditions in vitro can up-regulate other virulence genes such as bsa t3ss. it is possible that this increased invasion was partly controlled by other salinity associated invasion- and virulence mechanisms, at least by coordinating regulation of the bsa t3ss  <cit> . previous studies have demonstrated that the mutant defect in bsa t3ss genes such as bsaz and bipd remained trapped in vesicles at earlier infection time points, but at  <dig> and 12 hrs after infection, the bsaq and bsaz mutants are able to escape into the cytosol and multiply effectively  <cit> . however, our finding in this study indicates that the sdo is involved in the pathogenesis of b. pseudomallei by facilitating the invasion and initial intracellular survival within host cells. it is feasible that sdo modulates the nad+- or nadp+-dependent reaction associated with virulence expression when the b. pseudomallei encounters high salt stress.

the central role of bacterial defense against oxidative stress has been reported in many pathogenic bacteria  <cit> , especially during aerobic respiration and interactions with phagocytic cells. several reports have indicated that bacterial dehydrogenases are important enzymes in oxidative stress response, such as nadh dehydrogenase, lactate dehydrogenase, formate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, fumarate reductase, and glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase  <cit> . in bacillus subtilis, two glucose dehydrogenases  assigned to a family of short-chain dehydrogenases are required for severe ethanol stress  <cit> . in our present study, we found no difference in bacterial counts between the sdo mutant compared to the wild type b. pseudomallei on lb agar plates containing various oxidative agents for both nacl-treated and untreated conditions. this indicates that sdo might not be crucial for b. pseudomallei to survive in oxidative stress environments. however, the survival under oxidative stresses increased in nacl-treated b. pseudomallei with higher concentrations, from 0 mm to 150 mm, and up to 300 mm nacl . this finding suggests that nacl may contribute to increase the oxidative stress tolerance of b. pseudomallei. understanding the mechanism linking b. pseudomallei adaptation in saline environments to oxidative resistance requires further investigation.

in conclusion, our study revealed that b. pseudomallei sdo is involved in enhanced gdh activity in salt stress environments. the b. pseudomallei mutant lacking sdo had reduced abilities in invasion and initial intracellular survival. this indicates that this enzyme is associated with the pathogenesis of b. pseudomallei, especially when b. pseudomallei encounter salt stress. due to the important role of sdo in pathogenesis, microbial sdos might be a new target for the development of novel antibiotics. thus, an understanding of the salt stress response of b. pseudomallei by the induction of sdo may provide important information in developing a new strategy for treatment of melioidosis.
