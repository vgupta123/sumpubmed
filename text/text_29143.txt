BACKGROUND
soil salinity and alkalinity both represent significant constraints to crop productivity. nearly  <dig> million hectares of the land are affected by salt–alkali stress, and over  <dig> million hectares are alkalinized soils  <cit> . alkaline salt stress and neutral salt stress are two distinct kinds of stresses for plants and should be called alkali stress and salt stress. salt stress in the soil generally involves osmotic stress and ion injury, while alkali stress has an added high-ph effect. the high-ph directly affects the absorption of mineral elements and interferes with ionic balance. thus, the effects of soil alkalinization on plants resulting from high concentrations of nahco <dig> and na2co <dig> may be more destructive than the effects of soil salinization induced by the accumulation of neutral salts, such as nacl and na2so <dig>  <cit> . the plant response to salinity stress has been exhaustively researched, but much less attention has been paid to analysing the effect of soil alkalinity on plant growth and development. the identification of alkali–responsive genes may provide valuable information on understanding the genetic basis of plants to alkali stress and improve alkali tolerance of crops by genetic engineering.

wheat is an important crop in the world because of its high production , wide geographical range and high proportion of human consumption. wheat is a glycophyte which is relatively sensitive to both salinity and alkalinity stress. however, two wheat lines, named as shanrong no.  <dig>  and shanrong no.  <dig>  were reported as salinity tolerant lines due to their more tolerant of salinity than jn <dig>  <cit> , which were selected from the derivatives of an asymmetric somatic hybridization between the salinity sensitive line, bread wheat cultivar jinan  <dig>  and the highly tolerant related species, tall wheatgrass   <cit> . transcriptomic and proteomic experiments showed that imposing salinity stress induced the differential up- or down-regulation of many genes present in sr <dig>  and some of these, when expressed as transgenes, produced a marked positive impact on the plant’s level of salinity tolerance . although field trials showed that sr <dig> out-performs sr <dig> in ph neutral saline soils, the reverse was the case in alkaline ph saline soils . thus, while sr <dig> had been registered as a salinity tolerant cultivar, sr <dig> was recommended for cultivation on high ph soils which is, therefore, a suitable material for identifying alkalinity tolerant associate genes.

genome scale analysis of gene expression profiles is a powerful method to understand biological functions, such as cell differentiation, development and stress responses. with the increasing availability of sequencing data, expression profiling has been widely used in recent years to identify genes that are involved in the adaptive responses to drought and other abiotic stresses. high-throughput transcriptome sequencing and digital gene expression  tag profiling are efficient and cost-effective methods for characterizing non-model organisms without the need for a reference genome  <cit> . dge is particularly useful for identifying differentially expressed genes, thanks to its capacity to detect unknown and low abundance transcripts, and to generate absolute  transcript abundances  <cit> .

recently, some studies for alkaline-stress responses have been reported in glycine soja, leymus chinensis and tamarix hispida ; however, there is still little information about the alkaline-stress responses of common wheat. the present study focuses on the short-term and more sustained responses of the wheat root to alkalinity stress, by contrasting the sr <dig> transcriptome with that of jn <dig> using dge profiling method.

RESULTS
the plant response to alkalinity stress
the growth of seedlings and their roots of wheat line, sr <dig> was less inhibited than that of wheat cultivar jn <dig> when they were grown in the presence of the alkalinity stress. the growth of the seedlings and roots were similar between sr <dig> and jn <dig> when they were grown in the absent of the alkalinity stress . however, the shoot dry weight and root length were reduced to ~ <dig> and ~35% respectively in sr <dig>  while they were reduced to ~ <dig> and 53% respectively in jn <dig> .fig.  <dig> growth of seedlings and roots of jn <dig> and sr <dig> under non-alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. a-d three week old jn <dig> and sr <dig> seedlings grown under non-alkalinity stress  and under  <dig> mm alkali salts . bar:  <dig> cm length. e-f the effect of alkalinity stress on shoot dry weight  and root length . data are given in the form mean ± s.d. the double asterisks represent significant difference determined by the student’s t-test at p <  <dig>  




the high-salt environments in alkaline soil can break the ion homeostasis of plant cells; moreover, the high-ph caused by alkali stress directly affects the absorption of mineral elements. to understanding how sr <dig> adapt to overcome alkali stress, we analyzed the ion contents in roots of sr <dig> and jn <dig>  the alkaline medium induced an increased na+ and decreased k+ contents, overall lowering the k+⁄na+ ratio in the roots of both wheats. the effect of the stress on root na+ content was more marked for jn <dig> than for sr <dig>  and vice versa for root k+ content . sr <dig> line maintained a higher root k+/na+ ratio than that in jn <dig> cultivar. root ca2+, mg2+ and total fe concentrations were increased by the alkalinity stress in both cultivars, but sr <dig> maintained a higher level of root ca2+, mg2+ and total fe content than that of jn <dig> . in contrast, alkali stress had little effect on the levels of zn2+ and cl− in both cultivars . alkali stress significantly decreased the levels of mn2+, nh4

the high-ph caused by alkali stress can also directly affect the internal ph of the plant. to investigate how sr <dig> adapt to overcome the high-ph under alkali stress, we detected the intracellular ph in roots of both wheats by using ph indicator 2′7′-bis-5-carboxyfluorescein . under alkalinity stress, the bcecf fluorescence was decreased in root of both sr <dig> and jn <dig> compared to non-stressed condition, however, the fluorescence intensity was much lower in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> under alkalinity stress . since the bcecf fluorescence intensity was proportional to the intracellular ph , we calculated the intracellular ph in root of both sr <dig> and jn <dig> according to bcecf fluorescence intensity. results indicated that the intracellular ph fell about  <dig>  and  <dig>  ph unit in jn <dig> and sr <dig>  respectively, under alkalinity stress .fig.  <dig> the intracellular ph of seedling roots of jn <dig> and sr <dig> under non-alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. a-d fluorescence images for jn <dig> and sr <dig> under non-alkalinity stress  and under  <dig> mm alkali salts . e the fluorescence intensity is proportional to ph. f the intracellular ph of seedling roots of jn <dig> and sr <dig>  data are given in the form mean ± s.d




environmental stresses including alkali stress can induce the production of toxic reactive oxygen species , which if not controlled, can pose a threat to cells. thus, plants have developed antioxidant mechanisms to eliminate superfluous ros under alkaline-saline stress, in which superoxide dismutase , ascorbate peroxidase , glutathione peroxidase , peroxidase  and catalase  are most important antioxidative enzymes. to assess whether sr <dig> can effectively scavenge ros under alkali stress, we detected the ros content and activity of major ros scavenging enzymes in roots of both wheats. ros can degrade polyunsaturated lipids to form malondialdehyde , which is generally taken as a marker of oxidative stress, thus we also detected the content of mda in roots of both sr <dig> and jn <dig>  both o2
•− radicals and h2o <dig> was raised by alkali stress in wheats, and both cultivars accumulated similar level of ros in the absence of alkalinity stress, but, in the presence of stress, sr <dig> accumulated ros less than jn <dig> did . similarly, root mda content was raised by the stress, but less so in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> . with respect to the activities of the ros scavenging enzymes sod, apx, gpx, cat and pod, the activity of cat was consistently higher in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> ; the activities of sod, apx and gpx were inhibited by the stress, but the activity level of sod and apx were consistently higher in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> ; while the activity of pod was unaffected by the stress in sr <dig>  but its activity was increased in jn <dig> . these results were fully consistent with the alkalinity tolerance profiles which showed that sr <dig> displaying a superior tolerance of alkalinity stress than jn <dig> fig.  <dig> content of ros and activities of ros scavenging enzymes of seedling roots of jn <dig> and sr <dig> under non-alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. a root o2

transcriptome profilings of wheat seedling roots under alkalinity stress
a total of  <dig> , <dig> unfiltered tags were recovered from the six libraries , with the number of sequences from each sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million. after data filtering, a total of  <dig> , <dig> clean tags were obtained for further analysis. the cleaned tags of each sample ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>  million. about 50% of the clean tags can be mapped to the reference sequences from ncbi unigene databases, and most of them were uniquely mapped to gene tags . all these unambiguous tags were mapped to over  <dig>  unigenes . the clean tags were also mapped to the wheat genomic dna sequences from the iwgsc website . although the percentage of the clean tags mapped to iwgsc wheat genome sequences  were higher than that mapped to ncbi unigene databases , the percentage of unambiguous tags mapped to the iwgsc wheat genome sequences  were much less than that of ncbi unigene databases  . since only unambiguous tags can be used for expression analysis, thus, the ncbi unigene databases were used for wheat rna-seq tags annotation.table  <dig> statistics analysis of the six dge tag libraries constructed from the seedling roots of jn <dig> and sr <dig> mapping to ncbi unigene databases

the dge analysis identified a set of  <dig>  and  <dig> genes respectively as being transcriptionally altered in sr <dig> and jn <dig> through the exposure to alkalinity stress conditions . to verify whether the dge output represented the true variation of the transcripts, twelve genes were randomly chosen for the qrt-pcr amplification. the results were clearly showed that the qrt-pcr data were consistent with the dge output . to evaluate the biological functions of alkaline stress responsive genes, go enrichment analysis were conducted. in all,  <dig> go categories were over-represented in sr <dig>  , while  <dig> go categories were over-represented in jn <dig>  . the go categories over-represented in both wheat cultivars were much similar, with most of them for the metabolising different compounds, responsing to stress and iron transport. in sr <dig> there were also go categories for response to ros, epigenetic regulation of gene expression and protein targeting, while rna modification was over-represented in jn <dig>  in sr <dig>  a group of  <dig> differential expressed genes were associated with signal transduction and  <dig> genes in transcription regulation, which included genes encoding calcium sensors, protein kinases, alternative splicing factors and various transcription factors. another  <dig> genes were associated with protein modification, among which were proteins involved in phosphorylation, small ubiquitin-related modifier  modification, ubiquitin modification and ubiquitin-like modification. there were  <dig> genes encoding ion transport proteins,  <dig> genes encoding enzymes participating in lipid metabolism, organic acid metabolism and phenylpropanoid metabolic processes,  <dig> genes associated with ros scavenging,  <dig> genes encoding chaperones, five genes involved in dna damage repair and five genes involved in chromatin structure remodeling. in jn <dig>   <dig> differential expressed genes were associated with rna modification, including those for pre-mrna processing factor, rna helicase and pre-mrna-splicing factor.fig.  <dig> qrt-pcr-based validation of the transcription expression of twelve genes selected from the dge analysis. a ca2+/h+-exchanging protein. b aaa-type atpase. c nrt1/ptr-like transporter. d auxin response factor 6-like. e auxin induced protein pcnt <dig>  f ascorbate peroxidase. g ethylene responsive factor 5a. h dna damage-binding protein 1a. i dna repair protein rad <dig>  j pp2a regulatory subunit tap <dig>  k mads-box transcription factor taagl <dig>  l mads-box transcription factor taagl <dig>  the qrt-pcr data are given in the form mean ± s.d. . the asterisk and double asterisks represent significant difference determined by the student’s t-test at p <  <dig>   and p <  <dig>  , respectively

exposured the seedlings to alkali stress for  <dig>  h,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated, while  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated, respectively in sr <dig> and jn <dig>  under the  <dig> h exposure,  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated, while  <dig> and  <dig> genes were down-regulated, respectively in sr <dig> and jn <dig> . of these differential expressed genes under two conditions,  <dig> genes were up- and  <dig> genes down-regulated commonly in both treatments in sr <dig>  while  <dig> genes were up- and  <dig> genes down-regulated commonly in both treatments in jn <dig>  a set of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were up-regulated in the short exposure treatment, but down-regulated in the long one, while  <dig> and  <dig> other genes behaved in the opposite way, respectively in sr <dig> and jn <dig>  the transcription of a major proportion of the genes was altered either under only the short exposure , or under only the long exposure  . among the genes affected by the stress at both time point in sr <dig>  ten encoded chaperones and were strongly induced, six encoded heat shock proteins, ten encoded transporter proteins , nine encoded glutathione transferase and four encoded enzymes involved in phenylpropanoid synthesis.fig.  <dig> the relationship of differential expressed genes under alkalinity stress conditions treated for  <dig>  h and for  <dig> h. a differential expressed genes in sr <dig>  b differential expressed genes in jn <dig>  four ovals represent the four types of differential expressed gene groups which are indicated above the figure. the numbers within one circle denote the number of genes up- or down-regulated by alkali stress condition at one time point. the numbers within multiple circles denote the number of genes up- or down-regulated by alkali stress condition at multiple time points




most of the genes specifically regulated by the short alkalinity stress treatment in sr <dig> encoded proteins involved in signal transduction , transcription regulation , ion transport  and molecular chaperoning . the  <dig> signal transduction genes included eight genes encoding calmodulin, calcineurin b-like proteins , cbl-interacting protein kinase or calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, five genes encoding mitogen-activated protein kinases, ten genes encoding receptor like kinases, three genes encoding jasmonic acid-related proteins and a homolog of the gibberellin receptor gid <dig>  the  <dig> regulated transcription regulation genes contained six genes encoding alternative splicing regulators, six genes encoding zinc finger transcription factors, five genes encoding members of the myb transcription factor family and four genes encoding nam, ataf <dig> , cuc <dig>  transcription factors. the regulated transporter genes were one gene encoding the vacuolar proton-inorganic pyrophosphatase , one gene encoding ca2+/h+-exchanging protein and one genes encoding transporters for no3

the genes regulated by the long exposure time to alkali stress in sr <dig> were genes encoding proteins associated with the cellular response to nutrition status, ion transport, redox homeostasis balance, histone modification and cellular metabolism. there were  <dig> genes encoding transporters . in addition, there were  <dig> genes encoding ros scavenging enzymes, including sod, thioredoxin and glutathione transferase. genes encoding a ros responsive dna damage repair-related poly  polymerase, an rcd1-like protein  <cit>  and two dna damage repair proteins were up-regulated, while the set of genes repressed included four genes encoding various histone variants and one gene encoding histone deacetylase 19-like protein. there were  <dig> genes involved in cellular metabolism were specifically induced, including  <dig> genes encoding enzymes involved in lipid metabolism, nine genes encoding enzymes in carbohydrate metabolism and five genes encoding enzymes in flavonoid synthesis. two gibberellin associated genes were up-regulated: one encoded a gibberellin 3-oxidase and the other was a homolog of spindly, a negative regulator of ga signalling. details of all of these regulated genes are listed in additional file 4: table s <dig> and additional file 5: table s <dig> 

the differential response of sr <dig> and jn <dig> to alkalinity stress
in the absence of alkaline stress,  <dig>  genes  showed differentially transcribed in sr <dig> compared to that in jn <dig> . the most well populated go categories were those involved in transport, transcription regulation, signal transduction, epigenetic modification, cellular metabolism and molecular chaperoning. among the  <dig> genes involved in transport, seven genes encoding no3
− transporters, six genes encoding aquaporins, two genes encoding nh4
+ transporters, two genes encoding vacuolar h+-atpases, and one gene encoding a plasma memebrane h+-atpase. among the  <dig> transcription factor genes,  <dig> genes were more abundantly transcribed in sr <dig> than that in jn <dig>  similarly, nine genes encoding protein kinases were up-regulated in sr <dig>  as well as one gene encoding a jasmonate-induced protein and one gene encoding jaz protein. there were  <dig> genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism which were differentially transcribed in sr <dig> and jn <dig>  the abundance of seven transcripts associated with flavonoid synthesis was less in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  all eight differentially transcribed genes involved in epigenetic regulation were down-regulated in sr4; these included three genes encoding histone variants, two genes encoding dna methyltransferases, one gene encoding histone deacetylase, one gene encoding dna- lyase and one gene encoding chromatin assembly factor protein.fig.  <dig> differential expressed transcripts in sr <dig> and jn <dig> under both non- alkalinity and alkalinity stress conditions. a genes transcribed more abundantly in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  b vice versa




following the short alkalinity stress treatment, the abundance of  <dig> transcripts was higher and that of  <dig> was lower in sr <dig> compared to in jn177; the numbers under the long exposure were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively . the majority of genes encoding transporters  were more highly transcribed in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  a set of  <dig> genes encoding various transcription factors were up-regulated in sr <dig> in response to the stress. as also was the case in the absence of the stress, the abundance of transcripts was more abundant in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> including the genes encoding a plasma membrane h+-atpase, a jasmonate-induced protein and a jaz protein. most of the  <dig> regulated genes encoding ros scavenging enzymes were more highly transcribed in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  including genes encoding sod, glutathione transferase and dehydroascorbate reductase. the transcription of an rcd1-like homolog was also more abundant in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  although the seven genes involved in epigenetic regulation which were differentially transcribed in sr <dig> than jn <dig> in the absence of stress were down-regulated in sr <dig>  six of the seven were more strongly induced by the  <dig> h stress episode in sr <dig> than jn <dig> 

discussion
sr <dig> has greater tolerance to alkaline stress than jn177
root and shoot lengths are both sensitive indices of the plant response to abiotic stress. while the alkalinity stress imposed here was sufficiently strong to compromise the growth of both the wheat seedling shoot and root, sr <dig> was clearly better able to tolerate with the stress than was jn <dig> . the ability of plants challenged with alkalinity stress to take up k+ is typically weakened, which also leads to the over- uptaking of the toxic ion na+. the ability of a plant to maintain k+/na+ ratio homeostasis has been suggested as a diagnostic of tolerance to both salinity and alkalinity stress. when plants were exposed to alkalinity stress, the low tolerant jn <dig> plants were less able to maintain their k+/na+ ratio than were the sr <dig> ones. in addition, less mda was generated in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> roots, which implied that a reduced level of plasma membrane damage caused by lipid peroxidation.

sr <dig> possesses a high ability in absorbing nutrient ions under alkali stress
the cellular response to alkalinity stress is much less well studied than that to salinity stress. it has been suggested that a high ph environment can inhibit the plant’s capacity to take up no3
− and h2po4
−, with consequences for the nutritional status of the plant  <cit> . the transcriptome analysis revealed that a number of no3
−, h2po4
− and so4
2− transporters were much more strongly up-regulated in sr <dig> plants under alkalinity stress condition than in jn <dig> plants. the qrt-pcr analysis also indicated that a nitrate transporter gene nrt <dig> was induced in sr <dig> under alkalinity stress . moreover, the no3
− and h2po4
− content were much higher in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> under alkali stress . the implication is that the genetic make-up of sr <dig> allows it, when exposed to alkalinity stress, to better maintain an adequate supply of key anions than can jn <dig>  a high soil ph has a significant impact on the availability of a number of important cations , with further negative consequences for the ion homeostasis and nutritional status  <cit> . graminaceous plants acquire fe3+ by releasing phytosiderophores able to chelate the ion. of note is that the constitutive expression in barley of an fe phytosiderophore transporter gene has a marked ameliorative effect on the plant’s tolerance of alkaline soil  <cit> . the present analysis revealed that two putative fe phytosiderophore transporter genes were up-regulated by alkalinity stress in sr <dig> and that their transcript abundance was higher than in jn <dig>  in addition, a number of other cation transporter genes were induced by alkalinity stress in sr <dig>  and two of these  were differentially up-regulated in alkalinity stressed sr <dig>  physiological analysis also indicated that sr <dig> contained higher levels of ca2+, mg2+, total fe, mn2+ and nh4
+ than jn <dig> under alkali stress . taken together, we suggest that sr <dig> may have a higher ability to absorb both nutrient anions and cations than jn <dig> under alkaline condition, which may help to explain the better performance of this cultivar upon alkalinity.

sr <dig> controls the intracellular and rhizosphere ph levels more effectively than jn177
in addition to its impeding nutrient uptake, a high soil ph can also directly affect the internal ph of the plant  <cit> . part of the resistance mechanism against alkalinity stress involves the expenditure of energy to control both the intracellular and rhizosphere ph. eukaryotic cells have evolved for this purpose various ion pumps, such as plasma membrane proton translocating atpases , vacuolar h+-atpases  and proton pyrophosphatase . v-atpases form part of the cellular machinery responsible for regulating intracellular ph , while h+-ppases act to complement v-atpase transport activity through the acidification of intracellular compartments  <cit> . the dge analysis revealed a number of genes encoding v-atpase or h+-ppase being induced by alkalinity stress; some of these were more abundantly transcribed in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  measurement of intracellular ph also indicated that the root intracellular ph decreased in both alkalinity stressed jn <dig> and sr <dig>  moreover, it was much lower in sr <dig> than in jn <dig> under alkalinity stress , which coincide with the dge data. the implication is that sr <dig> may be better able than jn <dig>  through its use of various v-atpases and h+-ppases, to maintain intracellular ph homeostasis when challenged with alkalinity stress.

the plasma membrane h+-atpases of plant cells establish the ph and membrane potential gradients across the plasma membrane  <cit> , and some recent research has shown that plasma membrane h+-atpase appears to mediate proton secretion during the adaptation of the root to alkaline stress  <cit> . the protein kinase pks <dig>  inhibits the plasma membrane h+-atpase by preventing interaction with 14-3- <dig> protein, loss-of function pks <dig> mutant plants are more tolerant of high external ph due to extrusion of protons to the extracellular space  <cit> . moreover, a chaperone j <dig>  activates the plasma membrane h+-atpase by repressing pks <dig>  <cit> . in tomato, the product of tft <dig>  integrates proton efflux and the pks5-j <dig> pathway as part of the root’s alkalinity stress response  <cit> . the present transcriptomic analysis identified the differential up-regulation of one gene in sr <dig> encoding a plasma membrane h+-atpase gene, both under non-stressed and alkalinity stressed conditions. in addition there were three differentially regulated genes encoding a dnaj homolog chaperone, as well as one encoding a 14-3-3-like protein. this suggests that the differential transcription may enable sr <dig> to secrete protons more effectively into the rhizosphere than can jn <dig>  and thereby improve its ability to withstand stress.

sr <dig> tissue has a more effective ros scavenging ability than jn177
plants have evolved a number of ros removal mechanisms to avoid excessive cellular damage when high levels of ros are present  <cit> . sod converts o2
•− radicals to h2o <dig>  <cit> , which is in turn decomposed by apx, gpx and cat  <cit> . under alkalinity stress, sr <dig> showed higher sod, cat and apx activity than jn <dig> , and the transcript abundance of most of the  <dig> genes involved in ros scavenging was also higher in sr <dig>  direct measurement of ros showed that the sr <dig> accumulated less ros than jn <dig> . all these results suggested that sr <dig> had a powerful ability to prevent the over accumulation of ros and to protect the cells against ros caused by alkali stress. it had been concluded that the enhanced salinity tolerance of sr <dig>  the sister line of sr <dig>  also governed by a more active ros scavenging system than jn <dig>  <cit> . it seems like that the higher ros scavenging ability is the common feature of both sr <dig> and sr <dig> in defending salt-alkali stress.

the ros responsive rcd1-like gene tasro <dig> has been shown to be an important component of the enhanced salinity tolerance of the sr <dig> sister line sr <dig>  partly due to its ability to regulate ros homeostasis and partly to maintain dna integrity  <cit> . the same gene, along with two others associated with dna damage repair, was also induced by alkalinity stress, with a stronger level of induction in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  it suggested that sr <dig> might also have stronger ability to maintain dna integrity under alkali stress, like sr <dig> 

involvement of epigenetic modification in the alkalinity stress responses
since the abiotic stress response involves changes to the transcription of large numbers of genes, global regulation mechanisms are likely to be triggered by the stress. one such mechanism could operate through alterations in the chromatin, involving both non-sequence changes to the dna  and covalent modifications to the histone  or even the replacement of canonical histones by specific variants  <cit> . histone variants are known to affect the plant response to both low and high temperature stress, and also are induced by p starvation . the incorporation of histone variants depends in part on the action of histone chaperones and chromatin remodeling factors  <cit> . some aspects of transcription during episodes of abiotic stress have been shown to be affected by the methylation variants present within specific genes in a range of plant species . the somatic hybridization process  has been shown to induce wholesale alterations in cytosine methylation patterns, and some of these have been implicated in underlying the heightened salinity tolerance displayed by sr <dig>  <cit> . both cytosine methylation and histone deacetylation variants are believed to be responsible for regulating the level of transcription of certain salinity stress responsive genes in sr <dig>  <cit> . the present transcriptomic analysis identified eight genes involved in epigenetic regulation  which were differentially transcribed between sr <dig> and jn <dig>  and six of these genes were up-regulated by the imposition of alkalinity stress for  <dig> h and showed higher expression level in sr <dig> than in jn <dig>  whether epigenetic modifications are involved in alkali stress responses and its contribution to the alkali tolerance in sr <dig> will require further investigation.

CONCLUSIONS
alkali stress was normally closely related to salt stress in soil; however, alkali stress and salt stress are two distinct kinds of stresses for plants. salt stress consists of the low water potentials and ion toxicities factors, while alkali stress has an added high-ph effect, which is the major feature of alkalinity stress. the high ph surrounding the roots could direct some ions to precipitate, which may destroy the nutrient supply and ion balance around the roots. moreover, a high soil ph can also directly affect the internal ph of the plant. bread wheat cultivar sr <dig> expresses a superior tolerance to alkaline stress than its parent cultivar jn <dig>  this study showed that this superiority are due to its capability in taking up nutritionally important anions and cations, in having a more active ros scavenging ability and also probably in regulating both the plant’s internal ph and that of its rhizosphere. since higher ros scavenging ability was also involved in the salinity tolerance of another somatic introgression wheat cultivar sr <dig>  considering the extra high ph effect of alkalinity stress compared with salinity stress, the high absorbing ability for nutrient ions and the good regulating ability for intracellular and rhizosphere ph might be more important for alkali tolerance of wheat. all of the evidences provide clues for uncovering the tolerance of sr <dig> to the alkalinity stress and broaden our understanding of the mechanism of wheat to alkalinity.
