BACKGROUND
maize  is a tropical crop currently cultivated in high latitudes thanks to historical improvements of cold tolerance, reductions in growth cycle, and adaptation to long days  <cit> . improved cold tolerance would allow earlier sowing dates and thus would enable escaping summer drought, pests and diseases  <cit> . earlier sowing would also lead to longer vegetation periods, which can be used for biomass accumulation. maize genotypes grown in temperate areas have moderate cold tolerance and previous studies have found only some genotypes with partial tolerance .

since the advent of molecular markers and qtl studies, several reports have been published with limited impact on maize breeding for cold tolerance  <cit> . qtl reported for cold tolerance were associated with traits such as chlorophyll content or photosynthesis . strigens et al.  <cit>  carried out genome-wide association mapping for cold tolerance in a collection of maize inbred lines and obtained  <dig> qtl explaining between  <dig>  and  <dig>  % of the phenotypic variance for early growth and chlorophyll fluorescence. due to the highly complex architecture of cold tolerance-traits, they proposed whole genome prediction approaches rather than classical marker assisted selection for improving chilling tolerance of maize.

maize grown in cold areas of europe is reported to stand low temperatures better than maize from other origins. moreover, genotypes belonging to the european flint germplasm showed better cold tolerance than those originating from the corn belt dent  <cit> . previous reports found sources of cold tolerance in diverse collections of european germplasm . the largest study for evaluation of cold tolerance was reported by revilla et al.  <cit>  who evaluated the same two large panels of maize inbred lines adapted to europe for cold tolerance that was used for the present study. these authors found that the dent and flint germplasm most tolerant to cold temperatures were the northern flint d <dig> and the iodent ph <dig> groups, respectively. they also concluded that models intending the prediction of final performance from traits scored in early developmental stages are not precise enough for breeding. nevertheless, breeding for cold tolerance could be accomplished by combining inbreds from groups that can provide sources of favorable alleles for cold tolerance. the evaluation method and the traits used for assessing cold tolerance at early stages of development have been defined according to our previous experience  <cit>  taking into account traits that estimate cold tolerance for the subsequent steps of the heterotrophic stage from germination to endosperm depletion. according to previous information  <cit> , the main detrimental effects of cold conditions at early stages of maize development are delayed emergence, reduced chlorophyll content and efficiency of photosystem ii, and decreased early vigor and biomass synthesis. therefore, we have recorded data related to those features that can accurately be measured with large numbers of genotypes.

the objective of this study was to carry out genome wide association analyses for cold tolerance in two large panels of maize inbred lines and to suggest possible strategies for breeding new genotypes with improved cold tolerance.

methods
plant material
two panels of  <dig> dent and  <dig> flint maize inbred lines  <cit>  representing the breeding germplasm adapted to european agro-climatic conditions were evaluated per se and as testcrosses  <cit> . the panels were built from the collections of spanish, french, and german breeders involved in this research. they come from western europe and the usa. the inbreds are public and have been released throughout the history of maize breeding. the seed used in this study was produced by the inra , the technical university of munich  and the spanish institutions csic, neiker and ciam. the dent inbreds were crossed to the flint tester uh <dig> and the flint inbreds to the dent tester f <dig> in a winter nursery in  <dig> in order to evaluate testcross performance using each tester as the male parent and the inbreds of the panels as female parents  <cit> .

growth chamber trials
we used a cold chamber of 20 m <dig> built inside a laboratory with modulated panels, isolated with injected polyurethane. the  <dig> flint and dent inbreds were evaluated per se, along with six checks . dent and flint panels were evaluated separately in adjacent trials under cold and control conditions. after inbreds per se evaluation, testcrosses were evaluated for cold and for control conditions. evaluations of inbreds per se and testcrosses in control and cold conditions were made in consecutive runs. each trial followed a randomized complete block design with six replications  <cit> .

maize kernels were planted in a multi-pot trays; using one cell for each kernel. each cell had a surface of 3 cm ×  <dig>  cm and 5 cm depth filled with sterilized peat . six plants per inbred or testcross were used in each run of the growth chamber as there were six repetitions with one plant per replication in each trial. the experiments were watered after planting; afterwards the trials were watered as needed. temperature and light conditions for the cold experiments were 14 °c/14 h with light and 8 °c/10 h in the dark. in the control experiments, plants were grown at 25 °c/14 h light and 20 °c/10 h dark. cool light was provided by seven very high output fluorescent lamps per shelf with a photosynthetic photon flux of 228 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig>  distance between shelves and fluorescent lamps was  <dig>  m.

in every trial, data were recorded for 1) number of days from sowing to emergence, 2) relative leaf chlorophyll content  in the second leaf, using a hand-held ccm- <dig> chlorophyll content meter , 3) quantum efficiency of photosystem ii  recorded in the second leaf by using a portable os-30p chlorophyll fluorometer   <cit> . for inbreds per se we scored early vigor using a visual scale from 1 = weak plants to 9 = vigorous plants. for testcrosses, dry weight was determined by weighing the plants after drying them in an oven at 80 °c during  <dig> days.

statistical analysis
all inbreds were genotyped with the illumina maizesnp <dig> beadchip that includes  <dig>  snps covering all  <dig> maize chromosomes  <cit> . according to these authors, the design of this library started with  <dig>  snp derived from the first generation haplotype map , a collection of markers arising between b <dig> and mo <dig> provided by syngenta, and snps chosen from comparative sequencing of b <dig> and f <dig>  provided by inra, as well as snps collected from various other published marker sets  <cit> . they eliminated duplicated snps and those snps that contained nearby known snps in both flanking sequences, followed by four further stages of selection aiming at optimizing coverage of the genome and even spacing throughout the genome. data were filtered to exclude snps with more than 20 % missing values and less than 5 % minor allele frequency. heterozygote genotype calls were considered as missing data.  <dig>  and  <dig>  snps in the -dent and flint panels, respectively were used for gwas. genotypic data are available at rincent et al.  <cit> .

we used the genotyping matrix and a genetic kinship matrix  described earlier by rincent et al.  <cit> . best linear unbiased estimators  for inbred lines and testcrosses were calculated for each panel with the sas mixed model procedure  in sas software version  <dig>   <cit>  considering inbred lines or testcrosses as fixed effects and replications as random effects.

genome-wide association analysis based on mixed linear model  was performed with software tassel  <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . the mlm used by tassel was y=xβ+zu+e where y is the vector of phenotypes , β is a vector of fixed effects, including the snp marker tested, u is a vector of random additive effects , x and z represent matrices of 1 s and 0 s related to β and u respectively, and e is a vector of random residuals. the variance of random line effects was modeled as varu=kσa <dig>  where k is the n × n matrix of pairwise kinship coefficients and σa <dig> is the estimated additive genetic variance  <cit> . restricted maximum likelihood estimates of variance components were obtained by using the optimum compression level  and population parameters previously determined  options in tassel  <cit> . the optimum compression level option reduces the computation demand by clustering the  total individuals into  groups based on their realized genomic relationships, allowing the original k matrix to be replaced by a smaller relationship matrix.

the statistical significance threshold was set to  <dig> /meff, which corresponds to a bonferroni correction on meff tests, meff being the number of independent tests estimated  <cit> . we used the same threshold as rincent et al.  <cit>  because they used the same sets of lines. they evaluated  <dig> and  <dig> independent tests in the dent and flint panels respectively, which led to a -log <dig>  threshold of  <dig>  in both panels. significant snps separated by less than 700 kb were considered as a single qtl for the interpretation of the results. likewise, if snp <dig> was linked to snp <dig>  and snp  <dig> was linked to snp  <dig>  then we considered snps  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> the same qtl although snp  <dig> and snp  <dig> differed by 700 kb. we examined a 700 kb region left and right of each significant snp in order to identify candidate genes of interest by use of the maizegdb genome browser  <cit> .

local linkage disequilibrium  among markers in an 1500 kb interval surrounding the significant snps and common haplotype patterns were assessed in haploview version  <dig>   <cit> . haplotype blocks were defined with the confidence interval method of gabriel et al.  <cit> . only snps with a maf ≥  <dig>  and less than  <dig>  missing data were used to estimate ld.

heritability  for each panel , each condition  and inbreeding level  were estimated for each trait on a family-mean basis as described by holland et al.  <cit> .

RESULTS
association analyses
the compressed mixed linear model analyses for cold tolerance traits reduced the genetic effects by a compression level from  <dig> to  <dig> , being lowest for early vigor/early dry weight followed by days to emergence, and highest for Φpsii followed by chlorophyll content, although in most cases compression levels were in the range  <dig> to  <dig> . compression levels were made for grouping inbred lines and for making the subsequent analyses with groups, taking into account the similarities among inbreds within the panels. random genetic variability was not uniformly distributed for diverse traits and evaluation conditions and the number of individuals per group was variable as well, indicating that residual random variability was inconsistently distributed within groups.

according to zhang et al.  <cit>  the best control of the false positive rate for the validation of the compressed mixed linear model approach was when the compression levels were within a range of  <dig>  to  <dig>  <cit> . therefore, the control of false positives by our model is efficient for days to emergence and also for early vigor/early dry weight. focusing on inbreds per se under control conditions, we should note that compression level was less than  <dig>  for all traits except days to emergence for flint panel and early vigor for dent panel. background genetic effects modeled by k ranged from 2 % of the total phenotypic variation to 79 % in lines and from  <dig> to 59 % in hybrids. the proportion was higher for flint than for dent panel, for inbreds per se than for hybrids, and for Φpsii and early vigor. finally, the proportion was similar for evaluations under cold and control conditions, .

in general, traits showed intermediate heritability values  except for days to emergence. for this trait, low heritability value was obtained . for Φpsii, inbreeds showed higher heritability values than hybrids. heritability values were similar for dent and flint panels and for control and cold conditions. we expect higher genetic variability under cold conditions and higher error variance therefore heritability was similar under both evaluation conditions.

qtl analyses
the numbers of markers adequate for gwas analysis depends of the rate of linkage disequilibrium  decay, the panel diversity, and the objective of gwas analysis. ld decays fast and the diversity is large in maize, so a high number of markers should be used especially if the approaches is looking for candidate genes. however, both panels  are composed of lines adapted to europe and therefore we expect less variability than in the american panel where there are tropical and temperate lines. besides, the objective is looking for qtl associated to cold tolerance traits to explore new breeding possibilities rather than looking genes related to cold tolerance. therefore, for these panels the illumina maizesnp <dig> beadchip is adequate  <cit> .

qtl analyses were made separately for each panel , inbreeding level  and environmental conditions , although we focused mainly on the analyses of inbreds per se under cold conditions . number of panel lines used for gwas is highly important for the mapping power. for traits regulated by large number of loci with small effect increasing sample size will improve power. however, it will often increase genetic heterogeneity and could reduce the detection power especially for traits that are important for adaptation like cold tolerance traits  <cit> . besides, it is important to notice that most european flint inbreds have some historical and genetic relationships and most of them come from germplasm that has been adapted to european conditions for several centuries. conversely, the dent panel includes genotypes that have been introduced in europe during the last decades without consistent historical or genetic relationships among groups  <cit> . therefore, flints and dents should be analyzed separately in order to respect the genetic structure of the genotypes.

altogether, we found  <dig> snps significantly associated to any trait, most of them were found for the inbreds evaluated per se  . the higher number of significant qtl found in inbred lines, compared to testcrosses could be due to the masking effect of the inbred tester used for producing testcrosses, as pointed out by previous reports  <cit> . most of the significant associations  were found in the flint panel, probably because there was more variability for traits related to early plant development among flint inbred lines than among dent lines  <cit> . finally, most qtl  were identified under control conditions , presumably because experimental errors were higher under stress conditions than under optimum conditions  <cit> . similarly, strigens et al.  <cit>  found more qtl under control conditions than under cold conditions. however, strigens et al.  <cit>  found only  <dig> qtl under cold conditions probably because they evaluated a panel with fewer lines  than our two panels together .fig.  <dig> significant snps and qtl associated to cold tolerance traits in two association panels of maize. inbred lines were evaluated per se  and in testcrosses  under control and cold conditions



evaluations of dent testcrosses under cold conditions identified one qtl for days to emergence on chromosome  <dig>  and five qtl under control conditions on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . for Φpsii, dent testcrosses yielded only one qtl on chr <dig> under control conditions and none under cold conditions. flint testcrosses evaluated under cold conditions had  <dig> qtl for days to emergence located on all chromosomes except chr <dig>  while under control conditions there were  <dig> qtl on all chromosomes. for Φpsii, flint testcrosses had one qtl on chr <dig> under cold conditions, and none under control conditions. for early dry weight there was only one qtl on chr <dig> for flint testcrosses under control conditions.

evaluations of dent inbreds per se under control conditions identified  <dig> snps  on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for days to emergence, and for Φpsii there were  <dig> snps  on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  six significant snps were found in both traits . flint inbreds evaluated per se under control conditions revealed  <dig> snps  for days to emergence on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig>  and  <dig> snps  on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> for Φpsii.

nine snps  were significantly associated to cold tolerance-related traits for the inbred lines evaluated per se under cold conditions, three of them for the dent panel and six for the flint panel . the traits with significant snps were early vigor , three of them for the flint panel , days to emergence , Φpsii  and spad  that were located on chr <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the additive effect indicates that the major allele provides increased cold tolerance for the qtl of days to emergence, both qtl of Φpsii and one qtl of early vigor and less cold tolerance for both qtl of spad and three qtl of early vigor. the frequency of the alleles at each qtl was moderate except for some cases such as pze- <dig> with a frequency ratio of 27/ <dig>  finally, these qtl explained a proportion of phenotypic variance between  <dig> and 14 %, a range similar to that reported in previous publications of qtl for cold tolerance  <cit> .table  <dig> snps significantly associated to early growth-related traits, from association analyses in two panels of maize

for significant snps under cold conditions, an analysis of variance was performed to test snp × environment interaction. snps detected in the dent panel did not show significant interactions with environment. on the other hand, the interactions were significant for five of six significant snps detected in the flint panel. however, the interactions are range type because 1) snp alleles did not differ under control conditions, or 2) the favorable allele is the same under both conditions but the difference between the two alleles is significantly higher under cold conditions . this shows again the different behavior of flint and dent panels under cold conditions.

candidate genes were chosen based on the genomic sequence of the maize inbred line b <dig>  <cit>  within an interval of  <dig> kbp wide flanking regions upstream and downstream from the significant snp. we identified the closest candidate gene for the qtl in flint associated to put-163a-78121249- <dig> on chr <dig> for days to emergence with an intracellular signal transduction function and there were eight possible candidate genes in the interval . however, as in the qtls, candidate genes were also looked for in a wider region of 1400 kb significant around the snp . the closest candidate gene among the five genes close to the qtl in dent for spad on chr <dig>  has a protein heterodimerization activity. for the qtl in dent for spad on chr <dig> , there were four candidate genes and the closest one has a starch synthase activity; strigens et al.  <cit>  also found a qtl close to this position for one of the environments where they evaluated a panel of maize inbred lines for cold tolerance. the closest candidate gene between the two genes close to the qtl in flint for Φpsii on chr <dig>  has an oxidoreductase activity. there were three candidate genes around a qtl in dent for early vigor on chr <dig>  and the closest one has an unknown activity. the only candidate gene in the qtl interval in flint for early vigor on chr <dig>  has a sequence regulator activity. a second qtl in flint for early vigor on chr <dig> is only around 600 kb apart  and the closest candidate gene among the two in this qtl interval has a protein kinase activity. finally, the qtl in flint for early vigor located on chro <dig>  had nine candidate genes in the interval and the closest one has an unknown activity; but near this location, strigens et al.  <cit>  found a qtl for Φpsii, a trait related to early vigor, that was associated to a subtilisin-like protease precursor and a putative ethylene-insensitive3-like protein. several of the candidate genes identified have unknown function in maize and for many others, the annotation is based on homology to other species. these candidate genes could be studied in subsequent research projects in order to understand their role in the genetic regulation of cold tolerance.table  <dig> candidate genes from the association analyses for cold tolerance traits in two association panels of maize

breeding strategies for improving cold tolerance
there are few significant qtl associated with cold tolerance, which explain a small proportion of the phenotypic variance for cold tolerance characters. therefore, it would be interesting to build synthetics of lines with favorable alleles of significant qtl for cold tolerance. these synthetics could be the base material to start phenotypic or genomic selection programs aiming at the development of lines with improved cold tolerance. to choose the lines, we should take into account significant snps and if they are linked to other snps forming haplotype groups. there are  <dig> flint inbreds with favorable alleles for all six qtl associated with cold tolerance. however, there are not inbreds with all favorable alleles for all snps of haplotypes groups. it is because the combination of favorable alleles for the snp syn <dig> group, associated to Φpsii, was shown only by ch19- <dig>  uhf07721h and uhl <dig>  these inbreds did not have favorable alleles for other traits but they should be part of the synthetic to keep favorable alleles for cold tolerance. the best inbreds were ez <dig> and ia <dig> with  <dig> favorable alleles out of the  <dig> significant snps and haplotype groups . on the other hand, among the  <dig> inbreds six belonged to the group northern flint,  <dig> to the northern flint family of d <dig>  and one to the northern flint family of fv <dig>  the remaining  <dig> selected inbreds belonged to no-northern flint groups according to the grouping revealed in our previous study  <cit> . among the  <dig> selected inbreds, four  had also the favorable alleles for the three snps most significantly associated in the testcross trials under cold conditions . these four inbreds are unrelated and could be the base of a northern flint synthetic with the best combination of cold tolerance alleles and a wide genetic base, considering the diversity available within the northern flint race. ch19- <dig>  uhf07721h and uhl <dig> are also northern flint and should be included in the synthetic to increase Φpsii under cold conditions.

concerning the dent panel, four of the inbreds  carried the favorable alleles for the three qtl detected for inbred lines per se evaluated under cold conditions  and all of them had favorable alleles for all snps of haplotype group for spad and 6/ <dig> for haplotype group for early vigor. these inbreds were unrelated and belonged to a mixed group, except f <dig> that belongs to the stiff stalk pool. besides these four inbreds, there were eight inbred lines  that had two favorable alleles for the qtl of inbreds per se and for two qtl for the testcrosses. most of the inbreds carrying two favorable alleles belong to the “mixed” group. especially interesting were ez11a and ez <dig> because they had one favorable allele for early vigor that was not present in previously selected lines. however, to complete the favorable haplotype for early vigor we need the favorable allele for the first snp of the group. as <dig>  b <dig>  f <dig> or phk <dig> could be donor of this allele, besides they had two favorable alleles for the qtl of inbreds per se.

among the inbreds previously selected for cold tolerance per se  <cit> , in the present work the flint inbreds fv <dig> and uh <dig>  and the dent inbreds lh <dig> and fv <dig> were included in the set of selected inbreds based on genotype . considering the groups, the northern flint group d <dig> and the iodent group ph <dig> were among the selected groups based on both phenotype and genotype.

CONCLUSIONS
from this study, we draw four conclusions.  the use of two large panels of inbreds from the dent and flint genepools enabled identifying the largest number of qtl for cold tolerance ever published.  more qtl for cold tolerance were found in the european flint panel than in the dent panel.  most of the qtl were associated with days to emergence and efficiency of photosystem ii.  these results open new possibilities for improving cold tolerance either with genome-wide selection or with marker-assisted selection in maize breeding.
