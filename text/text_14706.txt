BACKGROUND
sacha inchi , also known as inca inchi or mountain peanut, belongs to the family euphorbiaceae. it is a perennial oleaginous woody vine indigenous to tropical peruvian jungles that lie at altitudes between  <dig> and 1500 m. this legume has a star-shaped fruit, which contains dark oval seeds characterized by high levels of protein  and oil   <cit> . its flour and oil are consumed by peruvian indians, who have used them to prepare foods and beverages for hundreds of years  <cit> . the fatty acid  composition of sacha inchi seed oil is distinctive because its seeds contain a large amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids  comprising about 93% of total fas. specifically, α-linolenic acid  comprises ca. 50% of the fas content, and linoleic acid  comprises ca. 35%. other fas such as palmitic acid , stearic acid , and oleic acid  are present in small proportions  <cit> . 

because pufas such as α-linolenic and linoleic acids cannot be synthesized in mammals, they are essential fas   <cit> . these pufas not only exert a hypocholesterolemic effect against coronary heart disease and hypertension when used as food supplements, but also are critical for the development of infants during pregnancy and breastfeeding periods  <cit> . the recommended ω-6: ω- <dig> fa ratio in the human diet is approximately 2: <dig> to 6: <dig>  <cit> ; however, traditional oil seed crops  have relatively low α-linolenic content . the high ω-6: ω- <dig> fa ratio in our typical diet  is thought to be a major contributor to cardiovascular disease  <cit> . in contrast, sacha inchi seed oil has an approximately 7: <dig> ratio of ω-6: ω- <dig> fas. the physiological mechanisms responsible for ω- <dig> fas biosynthesis in the seeds of sacha inchi are unknown. understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying seed development and lipid biosynthesis in sacha inchi may provide new insights for isolating novel genes and serve the use of genetic engineering to increase the α-linolenic content of traditional vegetable oils.

generally, two main pathways are involved in storage lipid accumulation: fa biosynthesis and triacylglycerol  assembly. in all plants studied, acyl carrier protein -dependent de novo fa synthesis occurs almost exclusively in plastids  <cit> . fas are synthesized from acetyl-coa in a three-step process:  irreversible carboxylation of acetyl-coa by acetyl-coa carboxylase to form malonyl-coa;  repeated condensation of malonyl-coa with a growing acp-bound acyl chain by fa synthase complex, consecutively adding two carbon units to form 16:0-acp; and  elongation and desaturation of 16:0-acp to form 18:0-acp and 18:1-acp, respectively  <cit> . desaturation of 18:0-acp to 18:1-acp catalyzed by a stromal stearoyl-acp desaturase is one of the key steps regulating unsaturated fa levels in the cell. in oilseeds, more than 95% of newly synthesized fas  are exported from plastids as coa thioesters to enter the eukaryotic glycerolipid synthesis pathway  <cit> . in the endoplasmic reticulum, acyl-coas can be used for the sequential sn- <dig> and sn- <dig> acylation of glycerol-3-phosphate to produce phosphatidic acid, and are then converted to  <dig>  2-sn-diacylglycerol  by phosphatidate phosphatase. the third acyl-coa-dependent acylation catalyzed by dag acyltransferase leads to the production of tag   <cit> . tag can also be formed by acyl-coa-independent reactions using dag and phosphatidylcholine  as acyl donors  <cit> . phospholipid:dgat  catalyzes the acyl transfer from pc to dag to form lysophosphatidylcholine and tag, whereas diacylglycerol transacylase catalyzes the transfer of an acyl moiety between two dag molecules to form tag and monoacylglycerol  <cit> . in the mature oilseed, tag is stored in densely packed oil bodies surrounded by oleosin protein  <cit> . usually, oil accumulation in developing seeds is associated with an increase in the number of oil bodies.

in oil-accumulating cells of plant seeds, 18c: <dig> is desaturated to 18c: <dig> and 18c: <dig> by two microsomal desaturase enzymes, fad <dig> and fad <dig>  <cit> . extraplastidic desaturation of 18c: <dig> to 18c: <dig> and 18c: <dig> arises while the fas are bound to pc  <cit> , the major site of fa desaturation in eukaryotes  <cit> . in current models of seed lipid biosynthesis, 18c: <dig> is incorporated into pc by one of two routes. direct incorporation from 18c:1-coa exported by the plastids likely occurs through the action of acyl-coa: lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  <cit> . alternatively, 18c: <dig> may be incorporated into dag by the kennedy pathway, after which 18c:1-dag is converted to pc by cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase  <cit> . oil-accumulating tissues use different strategies to enrich pufas in tag. for example, converting pc to dag  may be accomplished by the reverse action of cholinephosphotransferase or by phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase  <cit> . alternatively, pufas may be enriched in tag by pc acyl editing that incorporates nascent 18c: <dig> into pc and releases pufas, generating an acyl-coa pool of newly synthesized fas and further-modified fas for glycerolipid synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum  <cit> . mechanisms for pufa biosynthesis and accumulation are not known for most oilseeds, nor are the enzymes/genes that differ between the pathways  <cit> . because sacha inchi seed oil contains uncommonly high levels of ω- <dig> fas, it is a good model to dissect metabolic pathways involved in oil and pufa biosynthesis.

the development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has enabled the efficient and economical resequencing of entire genomes or sampling of entire transcriptomes. for example, illumina sequencing technology produces millions of short cdna reads from a single instrument run, which consists of the transcription level for each gene. it determines absolute rather than relative gene expression, thus providing greater insight and accuracy than microarray analysis  <cit> . de novo transcriptome sequencing and characterization based on illumina second-generation sequencing technology has enabled the rapid identification and profiling of differentially expressed genes in the sweet potato  <cit> , eucalyptus tree  <cit> , chickpea  <cit> , orchid  <cit> , taxus  <cit> , sesame  <cit> , and peanut  <cit> . however, transcriptomic information is lacking for sacha inchi. we were interested in identifying genes involved in pufa biosynthesis  in sacha inchi seeds during the period of fast oil accumulation; therefore, transcriptome analysis was carried out during two stages of seed development by using an illumina paired-end sequencing strategy. in this study, we generated more than four billion bases of high-quality dna sequence and obtained  <dig>  unigenes from the sacha inchi seed transcriptome. among them,  <dig>  unigenes showed a 2-fold or greater expression difference between the two seed development stages. the assembled, annotated transcriptome sequences and gene expression profiles provide useful information for the identification of genes involved in unsaturated fas and tag biosynthesis.

RESULTS
illumina paired-end sequencing and de novo assembly
the two cdna libraries were constructed from two stages of developing seeds   and sequenced by illumina high-throughput sequencing platform. we obtained a total of  <dig>  million 90-bp paired-end reads from two libraries , encompassing  <dig>  gb of the sequence data for each library . after stringent quality assessment and data filtering,  <dig>  and  <dig>  million reads with a base quality score greater than  <dig> were selected for further analysis and deposited in the national center for biotechnology information  short read archive . the gc contents of the two libraries were  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  , respectively.


the soapdenovo assembly program developed specifically for use with high-throughput short-read sequences  <cit>  was used for de novo assembly. from the high-quality reads in the s <dig> library,  <dig>  contigs with a median length of 234 bp were assembled . after paired-end joining and gap filling by soapdenovo, the contigs were assembled into  <dig>  scaffolds with a median length of 597 bp . although  <dig> % scaffolds had no gaps, roughly  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed . to further shorten the remaining gaps, paired-end reads were gathered with one end mapped on the unique contig and the other located in the gap region to fill small gaps within the scaffolds. sequences containing the least ns and that could not be extended on either end were defined as unigenes. the scaffolds were further clustered into  <dig>  unigenes with a median length of 660 bp . in this step, nearly half of the gaps were filled, and only  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed . for the s <dig> library,  <dig>  contigs were assembled, with a median length of 204 bp . from the contigs,  <dig>  scaffolds were generated, with a median length of 618 bp . although  <dig> % scaffolds had no gaps, about  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed . from the scaffolds,  <dig>  unigenes were obtained, with a median length of 674 bp . in this step,  <dig> % gaps were filled, and only  <dig>  mb gaps  remained unclosed . finally, unigenes from the two libraries were pooled and processed to remove sequence splicing and redundancy to generate a nonredundant unigene set. in total,  <dig>  nonredundant unigenes were obtained with a total length of  <dig>  mb . the size distribution showed that  <dig>  unigenes  were longer than 1000 bp . the gap distribution of the unigenes is shown in figure 2f. these results should provide a basis for future research such as gene cloning and transgenic studies. this transcriptome shotgun assembly project has been deposited at ddbj/embl/genbank under the accession gadc <dig> 


characterization of the nonredundant unigenes of sacha inchi
of the  <dig>  nonredundant unigenes, sequence directions of  <dig>  unigenes were determined by performing blastx searches against ncbi nonredundant, swiss-prot, kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes  database, and clusters of orthologous groups protein databases with an e-value cut-off of 10- <dig> and by using estscan software  <cit> . in addition, the protein coding regions of  <dig>  unigenes were predicted.

to annotate these unigenes, a homology search using the blastx program  revealed that  <dig>  ,  <dig>  , and  <dig>   of the  <dig>  sacha inchi unigenes had significant matches with sequences in the ncbi nonredundant, swiss-prot, and kegg protein databases, respectively. altogether,  <dig>   unigenes were successfully annotated in public databases. the e-value distribution of the top hits showed that  <dig> % of the unigenes showed strong homology to previously deposited sequences , and  <dig> % ranged from  <dig> e- <dig> to  <dig> e- <dig> . likewise, the score distribution showed that  <dig> % of the unigenes had scores > <dig>  and  <dig> % had scores ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> . the species distribution of the best match result for each unigene showed  <dig> % matches with arabidopsis sequences,  <dig> % with rice ,  <dig> % with popular , and  <dig> % with castor bean  . however,  <dig>   unigenes  could not be matched to known genes , suggesting that longer unigenes were more likely to have blast matches in the protein databases. the shorter sequences may lack a characterized protein domain or may be too short to show sequence matches, resulting in false-negative results. because genomic and transcriptomic information is currently lacking for sacha inchi in databases, these unigenes without hits may be considered putative novel transcribed sequences.


functional classification of sacha inchi unigenes by gene ontology, clusters of orthologous groups, and kegg
the currently available expressed sequences have been invaluable in defining the components of gene structure in sacha inchi. gene ontology assignments were used to classify functions of the predicted sacha inchi unigenes. based on the arabidopsis information resource gene ontology slim classification provided by blast2go  <cit> ,  <dig>  unigenes were categorized into  <dig> functional groups under three main divisions . in the biological processes category, metabolic processes  and cellular processes  were the predominant groups, followed by biological regulation , pigmentation , localization , and establishment of localization  . in the cellular components category, cell  and cell part  were the predominant groups, followed by organelles  and macromolecular complexes  . in the molecular function category, binding  was the predominant group, followed by catalytic activity , transporter activity , and transcription regulator activity  .


to evaluate our annotation process, the annotated unigenes were compared with the clusters of orthologous groups database for functional prediction and classification. in total,  <dig>  unigenes were assigned a cluster of orthologous groups classification. among the  <dig> categories, “transcription” represented the largest group , and transcripts associated with “replication, recombination and repair”  were most common followed by “post-translational modification, protein turnover, chaperones”  and “signal transduction mechanisms”  . the categories “nuclear structure” , “extracellular structures”  and “cell motility”  represented the smallest groups . however, categories with no concrete assignment, such as “function unknown”  and “general function prediction only”  accounted for a large fraction of transcripts .


pathway-based analysis can further our understanding of the biological functions and interactions of genes. a total of  <dig>  unigenes were assigned to  <dig> pathways in the kegg database. the most represented pathways included “metabolic pathways” , “biosynthesis of secondary metabolites pathways”  and “plant-pathogen interaction pathways”  . notably, some pathways are closely linked to changes in oil content and composition that take place during sacha inchi seed ripening, such as “fatty acid biosynthesis pathway” , “glycerolipid metabolism pathway” , “linoleic acid metabolism pathway” , and “α-linolenic acid metabolism pathway”  . these lipid unigenes identified provided critical clues to clone and identify key functional genes involved in unsaturated fa and tag biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds.

analysis of differentially expressed genes at the two developmental stages
to identify genes showing significant changes in expression between the two libraries, the expression level of each unigene was determined by using the reads per kb per million reads  method  <cit> . a general picture of the gene expression was plotted for the s <dig> library versus that of the s <dig> library . a total of  <dig>  unigenes showed ≥2-fold or expression difference between the two libraries. among these,  <dig>  unigenes were upregulated and  <dig>  unigenes were downregulated . the median rpkm value for all unigenes was  <dig> . of the  <dig> unigenes with rpkm values > <dig>  in the s <dig> stage, we identified two different transcripts encoding a proline-rich protein that is a structural constituent of the cell wall   <cit> , one transcript encoding profilin- <dig> , which is involved in actin cytoskeleton organization  <cit> , and one transcript  encoding arginine decarboxylase, which is thought to be required for embryogenesis  <cit> . these findings are consistent with rapid cell proliferation, which occurs during the early stage of seed development. among the  <dig> unigenes with rpkm values > <dig>  in the s <dig> stage, two of the most abundant transcripts code for omega- <dig> fa desaturase , reflecting the high level of α-linolenic acid in sacha inchi seeds. consistent with the high levels of asp and glu amino acids in sacha inchi seeds  <cit> , two transcripts were identified that code for glutamyl-trna amidotransferase subunit a and aspartyl-trna/glutamyl-trna amidotransferase subunit a , respectively. transcripts encoding putative lipid transfer proteins  were also abundant; these proteins are thought to participate in cutin formation, defense reactions, and response to environmental stimuli, as well as lipid transport  <cit> . another abundant transcript codes for oleosin , a protein thought to be involved in oil accumulation . a transcript related to seed maturation was also one the most abundant transcripts in the s <dig> stage .


to evaluate the potential functions of genes that showed significant transcriptional changes between the two libraries, gene ontology categories were assigned to the  <dig>  differentially expressed genes. these genes are related to  <dig> biological processes , including cellular and metabolic processes, biological regulation, localization, establishment of localization, response to stimulus, and pigmentation. with regard to cellular components, the analysis revealed a high percentage of transcripts in the cell, cell parts, and organelle categories . the unigenes were finally classified into  <dig> categories based on molecular function, and the two most overrepresented terms were binding  and catalysis . the association between these terms and the lists of differentially expressed genes was tested by gene ontology functional enrichment analysis. the hypergeometric test was used to map differentially expressed genes to terms in the gene ontology database, looking for terms that were significantly enriched compared with the genome background. in the gene ontology enrichment, most of the gene sets upregulated in the initial stage were associated with photosynthesis . however, gene sets related to oil biosynthesis began to be upregulated in the fast oil accumulation stage. in particular, genes associated with the endoplasmic reticulum lumen appear to play important roles in oil biosynthesis .


to further understand the biological functions of differentially expressed genes, we mapped these genes to the kegg database. in the kegg orthology enrichment, the most represented pathways included metabolic pathways , biosynthesis of secondary metabolites , and plant-pathogen interactions  . of these, pathways closely related to seed oil biosynthesis, including α-linolenic acid metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, biosynthesis of unsaturated fas, fa biosynthesis, and fa metabolism  may provide valuable information for the identification of novel genes involved in α-linolenic acid synthesis.

identification and characterization of lipid genes involved in fatty acids and triacylglycerols biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds
sacha inchi seeds have potential applications in food and pharmaceutical industries through its ability to biosynthesize and accumulate considerable amounts of linolenic acid. the main objective of this research is to understand the mechanisms underlying lipid biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds and to identify key genes involved in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fas serving genetic engineering practice for improving seed oil quantity and quality in traditional oil crops. expression level analysis of lipid genes between the initial and fast oil accumulation stages of sacha inchi seed could reveal the potential critical genes underlying unsaturated fas biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds. based on the annotation results, we summarized and compared expression levels of unigenes involved in fas and tag biosynthesis pathways in our two transcriptome libraries.

in total,  <dig> unigenes involved in fas biosynthesis and tag assembly were identified . in the fas biosynthesis pathway,  <dig> genes involved in the initiation and acyl chain elongation steps of de novo fas biosynthesis were identified, including  <dig> unigenes encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  subunits ,  <dig> unigenes encoding acetyl-coa carboxylase  subunits , one unigene encoding malonyl-coa acp transacylase ,  <dig> unigenes encoding 3-ketoacyl-acp synthases  , and six unigenes encoding other components of fa synthase  . the rpkm values showed that these genes involved in the initiation of de novo fa biosynthesis had at least one isoform significantly upregulated in the fast oil accumulation stage compared with the initial stage of seed development , whereas all those genes involved in acyl chain elongation of fas were upregulated in the fast oil accumulation stage, suggesting their functional involvement in fas biosynthesis . in addition, we identified eight unigenes encoding enzymes catalysing reactions that ultimately produce free fas ,  <dig> unigenes encoding long-chain acyl-coa synthetases , and seven unigenes encoding acyl-coa binding proteins  . both unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> encoding fata were upregulated 4-fold, and unigenes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> encoding lacs, were upregulated more than 30-fold in the fast oil accumulation stage , suggesting their involvement in fa synthesis.


in the pathway of tag assembly ,  <dig> unigenes were identified, including  <dig> unigenes encoding glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase ,  <dig> unigenes encoding lysophosphatidic acid acyltransferase ,  <dig> unigenes encoding phosphatidic acid phosphatase ,  <dig> unigenes encoding acyl-coa: diacylglycerol acyltransferase  . besides,  <dig> unigenes encoding nad-dependent glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase  were identified . in the fast oil accumulation stage, expression of unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> encoding gpdh were upregulated more than 8-fold; expression of unigene <dig> encoding pap was upregulated 7-fold; expression of unigene <dig> encoding dgat <dig> was upregulated 7-fold; expression of all unigenes encoding dgat <dig> were substantially upregulated . these results strongly implied that these genes upregulated in the fast oil accumulation stage might play a major role in tag assembly. after biosynthesis, pools of tag usually are stored in the form of oil bodies surrounded by oleosin or steroleosin proteins in seeds. generally, the expression of oleosin genes is tightly associated with oil accumulation in developing seeds  <cit> . seven unigenes encoding oil-body oleosins and seven unigenes encoding steroleosins  were identified with high expression in the fast oil accumulation stage , suggesting their involvement in oil accumulation in sacha inchi seeds.

for the formation of unsaturated fas,  <dig> unigenes encoding fatty acid desaturase were identified, including three unigenes encoding stearoyl-acp desaturase  , eight unigenes encoding oleate desaturase  , and ten unigenes encoding linoleate desaturase  . because the oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid are the major constituents of pufas in sacha inchi seeds, the function of  <dig> unigenes identified may underlie the molecular basis of pufas formation in sacha inchi seeds. expression analysis of the  <dig> unigenes between the initial and the fast oil accumulation stages showed that all unigenes encoding fad <dig> and fad <dig> genes  were weakly expressed in the fast oil accumulation stage, while most of unigenes encoding sad, fad <dig> and fad <dig> genes were highly expressed in the fast oil accumulation stage . in particular, the expression of unigene  <dig> encoding fad <dig> was upregulated 29-fold, and expression of unigene  <dig> and unigene  <dig> encoding fad <dig> were upregulated 265-fold and 287-fold respectively . genes fad <dig> and fad <dig> were both located and expressed in er in cells in association with storage lipid accumulation in cells  <cit> . these results indicated that genes fad <dig> and fad <dig> might play a major role in the formation of pufas in sacha inchi seeds. further cloning and functional analyses for unigenes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> would probably reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying pufas biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds. in addition, acyl-coa independent tag assembly pathway including acyl editing and pc-dag interconversion was believed to facilitate the incorporation of polyunsaturated fas into tag in some plant species  <cit> .  <dig> unigenes encoding phospholipases and  <dig> unigenes related to the acyl-coa independent tag biosynthesis pathway were identified . all of the twenty-five unigenes, however, have low transcript levels in the fast oil accumulation stage , and transcripts coding for phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase , a key enzyme in pufa synthesis in the acyl-coa independent tag-synthetic pathway  <cit> , was not detected in our libraries. these results implied that the acyl-coa independent tag biosynthesis pathway might not be an active pathway in tag biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds. for the  <dig> unigenes encoding phospholipases, most of the unigenes have relatively higher transcript levels in the initial stage of seed development compared to the fast oil accumulation stage . these unigenes may be related to the formation of membrane lipids and cell division. lipases that arose in developing seeds of castor bean may be involved in re-modelling of tags after synthesis  <cit> . seventeen unigenes encoding lipases  were identified from our libraries. the function of these lipase genes in sacha inchi developing seeds is unclear. the unigenes  <dig> and  <dig> encoding tag lipases were upregulated 13-fold and 7-fold in the fast oil accumulation stage, respectively . it appears reasonable to assume these lipase unigenes were involved in re-modelling of tags after synthesis in sacha inchi seeds.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here the first comprehensive dataset derived by using high-throughput sequencing technology  for sacha inchi. transcriptome analyses from two developmental stages  of sacha inchi seeds revealed  <dig>  unigenes. expression of  <dig>  unigenes differed at least 2-fold between the two libraries. transcriptome sequences were annotated with gene ontology and kegg orthology identifiers. functional categorization of differentially expressed genes reflected a number of important pathways, including the de novo fa biosynthesis, tag assembly and the formation of pufas. focusing on lipid genes, we identified  <dig> unigenes associated with the de novo fa biosynthesis, tag assembly and the formation of pufas from sacha inchi seeds. these unigenes provide the foundation for further studies on molecular mechanisms underlying oil accumulation and pufa biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds. in particular, those candidate genes  associated with pufa biosynthesis would provide critical clues to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the high levels of α-linolenic acid biosynthesis in sacha inchi seeds.
