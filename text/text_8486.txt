BACKGROUND
landraces and wild relatives constitute a vast genetic resource that can be tapped to introduce novel traits into tomato breeding programmes  <cit> . during the last decades, the focus has mainly been on the introduction of disease resistance genes. but, within the breeding efforts, the lack of sufficient molecular markers in tomato has been a bottle neck in genetic and linkage studies. although all known marker systems have been applied in tomato, most of them fall short in the genomics area mostly because they are too laborious and too low throughput  <cit> . these shortcomings are now being overcome by next generation sequencing projects and single nucleotide polymorphisms  identification  <cit> . the importance of snps as bi-allelic molecular markers is now widely recognized and their use is rapidly increasing  <cit>  , since they have the advantage of being locus specific markers that can be scored co-dominantly in a flexible way. technology has been developed for scoring single snps in thousands of different samples, all the way up to scoring millions of snps in a single sample  <cit> .

currently, the most widely used systems for high throughput snp genotyping are the illumina goldengate™, infinium™ arrays and the kbioscience competitive allele‒specific pcr genotyping system   <cit> . the evolution of genotyping technologies has resulted in unprecedented possibilities for evaluating germplasm collections, characterizing populations, and finding markers linked to specific alleles of important genes. snps are also markers of choice for studying evolutionary processes  <cit> . characterization of a large set of tomato varieties with a large number of markers can show the impact of breeding on the molecular level and the extent to which these markers are useful for variety identification  <cit> .

a whole genome tomato genotyping array  using the illumina® infinium beadarray technology  <cit>   was constructed to generate a multiplexing platform  <cit>  to analyse tomato germplasm. a set of  <dig> snps was used to evaluate more than a thousand tomato samples. this enabled us to compare data at the level of species, varieties and segregating populations. within the solanaceae coordinated agricultural project , in  <dig> sim et al. also developed a genotyping array  <cit> . however, they focused on different applications and, as we found out, with almost 100% different markers. we were interested in the question to what extent our snp collection, which is based on a limited number of genotypes, can be applied for variety identification, phylogenetic analysis, genetic mapping, evaluation of introgressions and germplasm identification.

RESULTS
snps evaluation and distribution
a set of  <dig> snp oligos  passed the quality check of illumina. from those oligos,  <dig> originated from 454-sequencing,  <dig> from illumina solexa and  <dig> from other studies .

a full list of the snps can be found in additional file 2: table s <dig> 

as the snps were chosen before the tomato genome was publicly released  it was not completely clear how the markers would be distributed over the tomato chromosomes and what the marker density would be. later all markers were assigned to their chromosomal position once the genome sequence  was available and a good coverage and distribution of the markers over the physical map was observed . some markers could not be placed on the genome and were placed on a pseudo molecule called chromosome  <dig>  on chromosome  <dig>  all markers are on the long arm because the short arm contains almost exclusively highly repetitive rdna sequences  <cit> . overall, the data quality was very good: the variety heinz was used as control on each microtiter plate  and of the  <dig> data points scored for this cultivar only  <dig> were deviating  and in most cases this was due to no calls .

however, approximately 10% of the markers could not be reliably scored mainly because of wrong automatic clustering by the genomestudio software. closely linked markers in segregating populations can be used to find the correct score and the reasons for the mistakes in the automatic clustering . six percent of the snps resulted in ncs. these markers were removed resulting in  <dig> snps for further analysis. forty eight percent of the monomorphic markers within s. lycopersicum still were useful because they were polymorphic within tomato wild relatives or between wild relatives and cultivated tomato.

constructing genetic maps
the snps were used to construct genetic maps in seven different mapping populations. for all of them the expected  <dig> linkage groups were found with most markers in the order as expected based on the tomato sequence . common ancestry of two parental lines resulted in regions without polymorphisms. figure  <dig> shows an example of a linkage group created from the few snps showing recombination. on chromosome  <dig> of an f <dig> population between two cherry tomato breeding lines only  <dig> polymorphic markers were found. although the genetic map still spanned  <dig>  cm the physical map showed that only a small part of the chromosome is covered by the  <dig> markers, apparently this part of  <dig> mbp has a high recombination frequency .

variation among varieties
with the snp markers we analysed  <dig> varieties plus some introgression free and other reference varieties . all varieties could be distinguished, although some were almost identical . only the varieties moneymaker and moneyberg were completely identical. the percentage informative snps differed between the varieties. when we compare moneymaker and r <dig> we will found about 5% polymorphic snps, between moneymaker and r <dig> this was about 37%. the differences do not necessarily correspond to only introgressions . the overall level of heterozygous markers within the varieties ranged from zero to almost 45% . the varieties included round, beef, and cherry types. in the dendrogram based on the snp markers  the cherry tomatoes were clearly separated from the round/beef group, which were intermingled. only the hybrid r <dig>  classified as round, was in the group of cherry type tomatoes. this variety turned out to be a plum type of tomato and was misclassified as round. to see which markers contributed most to the separation of round/beef and cherry, we selected the markers distinguishing at least 90% of the cherries from round and beef tomatoes. this resulted in a selection of  <dig> snps that covered small areas of chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> and the major central parts of chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . however, also on chromosomes  <dig> and  <dig> small groups of markers specific to cherry tomatoes were found .

among the cherry varieties, gardeners delight did not have the cherry specific chromosome  <dig>  and this variety has somewhat larger fruits than what we considered as cherry. in total four round tomatoes clearly had the cherry specific chromosome  <dig> , but after close inspection these were catalogued as deviating from round and more plum types.

identification of introgressions
modern commercial varieties contain several introgressions from wild relatives. most of these introgressions contain resistance genes  <cit> . we analysed a subset of varieties with known introgressions in detail and compared them with introgression-free varieties . markers directly linked to known resistance-genes were selected and evaluated. three markers were used on chromosome  <dig>  two linked markers and one marker within the dominant mi- <dig>  gene , conferring root-knot nematode resistance. in  <dig> varieties the genotype was identical to the introgression-free genotypes and  <dig> varieties had an introgression in this region . in  <dig> varieties the introgression was homozygous and in the  <dig> others heterozygous. tobacco mosaic virus resistance  is located on chromosome  <dig> and two markers were selected for this introgression, one corresponding to the gene and one to in the flanking region to confirm the introgression pattern. figure  <dig>  shows that the region containing the tm <dig> gene was present in  <dig> varieties taking into account the heterozygous introgressions. one of those varieties was r <dig>  for which the introgression was not reported . there were  <dig> varieties that lacked the introgression. differences in size of the introgressions were observed based on the polymorphism frequency among varieties. these differences were also compared with varieties annotated as introgression free and corroborated with known introgression .

snps for interspecific crosses in tomato
solanum lycopersicum cv. moneymaker is the standard introgression free tomato used in our group to make mapping populations for breeding and genetic analysis. therefore, we looked for markers that differentiate this s. lycopersicum cultivar from the majority of wild species accessions . a selection of  <dig> snps was polymorphic between moneymaker and all screened accessions of the more distantly related wild relatives of tomato , s. chmielewskii , s. neorickii , s. pennellii , s. arcanum  and s. chilense ). within this selection of markers, there were occasional  non-polymorphisms with one or more of the  <dig> accessions of s. cheesmaniae and s. galapagense and a slight higher number of non-polymorphic cases  within the  <dig> s. pimpinellifolium accessions .

snps among tomato species
representative accessions of wild relatives of tomato were analysed with the snp array to establish relationships in solanum sect. lycopersicon. the phenetic analysis was carried out using neighbour joining. the resulting tree is shown in figure  <dig>  these relations are in accordance with rodriguez et al.  <cit> . a bionj tree  <cit>  can be found as additional file  <dig>  figure  <dig> also shows that the number of ncs is becoming larger with increasing distance between the cultivated tomato and the wild relatives.

accessions from s. cheesmaniae and s. galapagense clustered together . in our study only approximately  <dig> snps  were found between the accessions of s. cheesmaniae and s. galapagense in spite of clear phenotypical differences in leaf structure and trichomes  <cit> .

discussion
quality of snp data
the high reproducibility of the results for the  <dig> heinz samples shows the robustness of the data obtained with the infinium array. this was also evident from the comparison between cv moneymaker and cv moneyberg where the only differences were a few ncs. although the data were of high quality, individual snp calls can be wrong. wrong calls can be recognized in dense genetic linkage maps of a species from which the sequence is known. we observed errors in 10% of the snps, when using the standard settings of the illumina genome studio software. such errors can be corrected manually or 10% of the snps can be deleted  <cit> . since the amount of data is vast, enough data remained after deleting 10% of the snps. reasons for errors can be dna quality, presence of outliers  within the germplasm and, in few cases, double signalling due to duplications in the genome.

general applicability of the snps
even though the snps were looked for in a limited number  of breeding lines of s. lycopersicum in combination with four introgression free varieties, they were polymorphic enough in the solanum sect. lycopersicon germplasm to discriminate varieties and species as well as to confirm phenetic relations. this implies that many of the snps originated from the time before domestication  <cit> .

the s. lycopersicum specific markers must have evolved after this species separated from the others. these markers will be polymorphic in any interspecific cross . a relatively cheap, snp array with a limited number  of well distributed markers will be an excellent tool for a first fast characterization of any new interspecific mapping population involving s. lycopersicum. based on our results such an array can be easily developed.

furthermore, it is interesting to note that so many snps were found among the four breeding lines. this result was quite unexpected as s. lycopersicum is considered as a species with little genetic variation  <cit> .

the use of snps to improve the tomato genome sequence
one application of the snp array was to compare genetic with physical positions when working with mapping populations. on the genetic linkage maps most of the markers were in the expected order; identical to the order in the assembled tomato sequence  <cit> . this confirmed the accurateness of the assembled tomato genome.

some unassigned markers could be mapped to specific chromosomal positions in one or more of the linkage maps that we produced . comparison of genetic linkage maps and the physical linkage map also pointed out a misassembly on the long arm of chromosome  <dig>  in version  <dig>  of the tomato genome. also the data published by sim et al.  <cit>  suggest a disruption of marker order in the same region , but the conclusion that this might be due to a misassembly was not drawn. markers should be used to genetically validate and further improve de novo genome assemblies.

variety identification
several dna profiling techniques have been used for variety identification  <cit> . for tomato, one of the most extensive studies was done by bredemeijer et al. in  <dig>  <cit>  using simple sequence repeats . they showed that 90% of the more than  <dig> varieties that were genotyped had a unique ssr profile using  <dig> markers . the snp array covered between  <dig> and  <dig> markers per chromosome and all varieties could be distinguished, except the varieties moneyberg and moneymaker. that these two showed identical profiles means that they are highly related, if not identical. both have been registered by the international union for the protection of new varieties of plants in the national listing in great britain , so phenotypic differences must have been seen. under the upov act of  <dig> such varieties would likely be considered as essential derived varieties  <cit> . the snp markers developed in our study will be very useful for establishing whether varieties are essentially derived from other varieties using the protocol developed for lettuce  <cit> .

the trend to exploit genes from tomato wild relatives for specific traits enlarges the variation in cultivated tomato and the differences among varieties  <cit> . such introgressions can easily be detected using the snp array as we have shown for the mi <dig>  and tmv gene. when gene-specific  snp markers are used, genotyping may substitute phenotypic assays even in variety registration as was demonstrated by arens et al. in  <dig>  <cit> . the markers also allowed us to determine the level of heterozygous markers in present day varieties, which varied between zero and almost 45%. it is interesting to see that the highest numbers are found for some of the plum/cherry tomato. this is most likely because they are hybrids between round and cherry tomatoes and the  <dig> cherry specific snps will contribute to a large number of heterozygous markers . the high throughput snp marker determination can be carried out at relatively low cost and is less laborious than other methods used. therefore it is likely that snp markers will be the markers of choice for variety identification and registration in future. however it may be anticipated that the snp arrays will soon be replaced by complete sequencing of varieties.

differences between round/beef and cherry tomatoes
many of the polymorphisms located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were between round/beef and cherry tomatoes. this suggests that regions on these chromosomes are essential to get the full cherry tomato phenotype and that there is selection for these regions in breeding programs for cherry tomatoes. the fact that whole chromosomes  look to be involved is possibly due to suppression of recombination in the large pericentromeric regions  <cit> . this is not the case on chromosome  <dig> where the cherry region is a hotspot of recombination as shown in a ril population of s. lycopersicum and s. pimpinellifolium under study  region of nuclear ribosomal dna sequences and, also alvarez et al. in  <dig> with microsatellite markers  <cit> . peralta et al.  <cit>  performed the most extensive taxonomic study of tomato and its wild relatives and our results confirm their findings.

in our analysis we found s. pimpinellifolium as the closest wild relative to s. lycopersicum, which is similar to observations made by grandillo et al.  <cit>  and the tomato genome consortium in  <dig> <cit> . the cherry tomato is considered either as a domesticated group or as an admixture of s. pimpinellifolium and s. lycopersicum <cit> . s. cheesmaniae and s. galapagense are also very closely related to the domesticated tomato. introgressions in the cultivated germplasm can affect the similarity weight in the relationships between s. pimpinellifolium, s. galapagense and s. cheesmaniae on one hand and s. lycopersicum hybrids on the other hand. for phylogenetic studies it is important to define the initial germplasm and its characteristics. in the case of s. habrochaites and s. pennellii the increased number of ncs decreased the resolution.

prospects of snp data in tomato
for our custom made array, the snp selection was based on commercial breeding lines. sim et al.  <cit>  developed a large snp genotyping array using commercial varieties. to evaluate if the same snps were present, the precise snp positions from both arrays were compared . only  <dig> snps, less than 2% of our snps were found in the exact same position or within the allowed window. this means that there is still a large number of snps to be discovered in tomato. for further comparisons among the two arrays we made the snps including the flanking sequences available at: http://www.plantbreeding.wur.nl/publications/snp/4072snp-sequences.xlsx.

CONCLUSIONS
our results show that an snp search in only a few breeding lines permitted the development of markers generally applicable in tomato and its wild relatives and furthermore that the illumina bead array generated highly reproducible data. our snps can be roughly divided in two categories: snps of which both forms are present in the wild relatives and in domesticated tomatoes and snps unique for the domesticated tomato. the snps can be used for genotyping, identification of varieties, comparison of genetic and physical linkage maps and to confirm phylogenetic relations. there is hardly any overlap with the solcap array and we suggest to combine both snp sets and to select a core collection of robust snps completely covering the tomato genome for the development of future arrays.
