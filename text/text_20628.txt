BACKGROUND
insulin-like growth factors  have a broad range of biological activities that include the stimulation of mitogenesis and differentiation, and insulin-like effects on glucose uptake and lipogenesis  <cit> . these activities are modulated by a family of six binding proteins, termed the igf-binding proteins  that bind igf-i and igf-ii with high affinity . igfbp- <dig> binds and inhibits the activity of igf-i and igf-ii in plasma, by regulating their bioavailability  <cit> . administration of excess igfbp- <dig>  or overexpression of igfbp- <dig> in transgenic mice, leads to glucose intolerance and hyperinsulinaemia  <cit> . meanwhile, igfbp- <dig> expression can be dynamically regulated by nutritional status, increasing during fasting, malnutrition and diabetes but decreasing upon re-feeding or insulin treatment  <cit> . hepatic igfbp- <dig> gene transcription is rapidly and completely inhibited by insulin  <cit> , however, the signalling pathway that mediates this effect is less well defined. insulin induces multiple intracellular signalling pathways in liver. stimulation of the small g-protein ras leads to activation of a protein kinase cascade consisting of raf- <dig>  map kinase kinase- <dig>  p42/p <dig> map kinases and p90rsk, while the activation of phosphoinositide  3-kinase promotes the generation of 3-phosphoinositides that induce the activity of protein kinases such as 3-phosphoinositide dependent kinase  and protein kinase b   <cit> . pkb subsequently phosphorylates glycogen synthase kinase - <dig>  at an n-terminal serine residue  rendering it inactive  <cit> . this pkb-mediated inhibition of gsk- <dig> contributes to insulin activation of glycogen and protein synthesis  <cit> .

studies using inhibitors of pi 3-kinase have demonstrated a requirement for this enzyme in insulin regulation of igfbp- <dig>  <cit> . indeed, overexpression of an active mutant of pkb mimics the effects of insulin on the igfbp- <dig> promoter  <cit> . this effect, at least in part, is mediated through the inhibition of a thymine-rich insulin response element  that lies between residues - <dig> and - <dig> relative to the transcription start site of the human gene promoter. phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase  and glucose-6-phosphatase , rate-controlling enzymes of hepatic gluconeogenesis, possess a related regulatory element within their gene promoters  <cit> . interestingly, members of the fox family of transcription factors  have been linked to the regulation of the tire's found in these promoters  <cit> . the expression of all of these genes, as well as the regulation of fox, is inhibited by insulin through a pi 3-kinase-dependent mechanism  <cit> , suggesting that a common signalling pathway is utilised by insulin to regulate these related tires. however, insulin regulation of igfbp- <dig> but not g6pase or pepck gene expression is sensitive to an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin   <cit> . in addition, agents that strongly induce the mapk pathway   <cit> , as well as the protein phosphatase inhibitor okadaic acid  <cit> , reduce the sensitivity of the igfbp- <dig>  but not the g6pase and pepck promoters to insulin. therefore, aspects of the signalling networks used by insulin to repress each of these tire containing promoters appear distinct. recently, we observed that gsk- <dig> activity was required for both pepck and g6pase promoter activity  <cit> . selective inhibitors of gsk- <dig> reduce pepck and g6pase gene transcription without requiring the activation of pkb. indeed, the inhibition of gsk- <dig> may explain some of the effects of pkb overexpression on pepck and g6pase gene expression. however, it was not clear why inhibition of gsk- <dig> should repress these promoters, whether inhibition of gsk- <dig> was actually required for insulin regulation of the genes, and whether the effect of gsk- <dig> inhibition was mediated through the tire.

in the present study, we have examined the role of gsk- <dig> in the regulation of a third tire-containing gene promoter, namely igfbp- <dig>  we demonstrate that four different classes of inhibitors of gsk- <dig> can mimic the action of insulin and reduce igfbp- <dig> gene expression. furthermore, we find that inhibition of gsk- <dig> reduces the activity of a heterologous promoter containing the igfbp- <dig> tire, and propose that this mechanism underlies the repression of all three promoters by inhibitors of gsk- <dig>  finally, we demonstrate for the first time a requirement for inhibition of gsk- <dig> in the insulin regulation of the tire, and hence igfbp- <dig> expression.

RESULTS
lithium ions reduce igfbp- <dig> gene expression in h4iie cells
treatment of h4iie cells with insulin completely inhibits both basal and glucocorticoid-induced igfbp- <dig> gene expression. lithium chloride, an inhibitor of gsk- <dig> in vivo, reduces both basal and glucocorticoid-induced igfbp- <dig> gene expression . the effect of  <dig> mm lithium is not as complete as observed with insulin, resulting in only a 60–70% reduction of igfbp- <dig> gene expression. however, treatment of h4iie cells with the same concentration of potassium chloride has no effect on igfbp- <dig> expression. the cyclophilin mrna levels remain unchanged throughout these experiments. this highlights a role of a target of lithium ions in the specific regulation of igfbp- <dig> gene expression.

more selective inhibitors of gsk- <dig> also reduce igfbp- <dig> gene expression
sb  <dig> and sb  <dig> are cell-permeable maleimide compounds that selectively inhibit gsk- <dig>  <cit> . treatment of h4iie cells with either compound reduces igfbp- <dig> gene expression . expression is more sensitive to sb  <dig> than sb  <dig> . importantly, cyclophilin mrna levels remain unchanged in the presence of these compounds. furthermore, under these conditions the regulatory phosphorylations of pkb and foxo- <dig> are unaffected by sb <dig>  sb <dig> or lithium  <cit> . in addition, sb <dig> or sb <dig> do not affect the phosphorylation of ser- <dig>  or ser- <dig> . similarly, mapk and s6k activity are not significantly affected by these compounds, as judged by the phosphorylation status of these insulin-regulated signalling molecules . hence, the effects seen with these compounds on igfbp- <dig> are likely to be due to the inhibition of gsk- <dig> rather than as a consequence of down/up-regulation of pkb, foxo- <dig>  mapk or the mtor pathway, which are known to effect igfbp- <dig> gene expression.

paullones are potent inhibitors of gsk- <dig> that reduce igfbp- <dig> gene expression
paullones are a family of benzazepinones that are potent , atp-competitive inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases  and the closely related neuronal cdk5/p <dig>  <cit> . subsequently, they have been shown to be very potent inhibitors of gsk-3β  <cit> . two members of this family, kenpaullone and alsterpaullone, reduce igfbp- <dig> gene expression in a dose dependent manner . alsterpaullone is much more potent than kenpaullone, reducing igfbp- <dig> mrna levels by 90% at  <dig> μm compared to a 50% reduction seen with  <dig> μm kenpaullone . once more, this is consistent with the lower ic <dig> of alsterpaullone toward gsk- <dig> in vitro  <cit> . alsterpaullone  does not affect the phosphorylation of pkb, foxo- <dig>  mapk, s6k or s <dig> . similarly, phosphorylation at residues ser- <dig>  and ser- <dig>  of gsk- <dig> is unaffected by alsterpaullone treatment . phosphorylation of thr- <dig>  correlates with the activation of pkb while phosphorylation of ser- <dig> , ser- <dig>  and thr- <dig>  is indicative of inhibition of these pkb substrates.

chir <dig>  the most specific gsk- <dig> inhibitor reported to date, also represses igfbp- <dig> gene expression
although alsterpaullone, kenpaullone, sb <dig>  and sb <dig> are potent inhibitors of gsk- <dig>  they also exhibit activity against cdks. however, the aminopyrimidine chir <dig> shows 350-fold selectivity toward gsk- <dig> compared to cdks , and exhibits a ki of <  <dig> nm in vitro  <cit> . it is the most selective inhibitor of this enzyme reported to date  <cit> . treatment of h4iie cells with chir <dig> dramatically reduced basal and glucocorticoid-induced igfbp- <dig> gene transcription, at concentrations between  <dig> and  <dig> μm 

chir <dig> reciprocally regulates β-catenin activity and igfbp- <dig> gene transcription
h4iie cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase-reporter construct containing tcf/lef binding sites, whose activity is regulated by the gsk- <dig> substrate, β-catenin. inhibition of gsk- <dig> results in the accumulation of β-catenin in the cytoplasm where it can form complexes with tcf/lef. the complex translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes. treatment of transfected h4iie cells with chir <dig> results in a dose-dependent increase in luciferase activity, regulated by the β-catenin/tcf complex . the β-catenin mediated transcription is induced two-fold by  <dig> μm chir <dig>  reaching six to seven-fold at  <dig> μm. therefore the concentration required to induce β-catenin activity is equivalent to that required for reduction of endogenous igfbp- <dig> mrna .

meanwhile, insulin treatment of h4iie cells previously transfected with a luciferase reporter construct under the control of a thymidine kinase promoter containing the igfbp- <dig> tire , reduces luciferase expression by 60% . this effect is abolished by a two base pair mutation of the tire  . interestingly,  <dig> μm chir <dig> reduces bp- <dig> wt activity by around 50% , while  <dig> μm inhibits luciferase expression by 70%, with no effect on bp- <dig> dm <dig> activity. this demonstrates that chir <dig> reduces tire activity, at a concentration that also induces β-catenin-mediated gene transcription . this strongly argues that the effects of chir <dig> on tire activity are mediated through inhibition of gsk- <dig> 

enhanced expression of gsk- <dig> reduces insulin regulation of the igfbp- <dig> tire
in order to assess the requirement for inhibition of gsk- <dig> in insulin regulation of the igfbp- <dig> tire we over expressed wild-type gsk- <dig> , insulin-insensitive gsk- <dig>  or control protein  in h4iie cells using adenoviral vectors. infected cells were subsequently transfected with bp-1-wt and treated with or without insulin . the inhibitory effect of insulin on the bp- <dig> tire was significantly reduced when gsk- <dig> was over expressed , demonstrating that inhibition of gsk- <dig> is required for full repression of this element by insulin. both wild-type  and s9a-gsk- <dig>  over expression  reduced insulin regulation of this element. meanwhile, adenoviral expression of gsk-3β-s9a also reduced the ability of insulin to repress igfbp- <dig> mrna in the h4iie cells .

chir <dig> does not regulate foxo- <dig> transactivation potential
bp- <dig> tire activity can be regulated by co-expression of foxo- <dig>  <cit> . therefore, we examined the effect of chir <dig> on the ability of foxo- <dig> to regulate tire activity. when foxo- <dig> is co-expressed with bp- <dig> wt in h4iie cells, the expression of luciferase is induced around 3-fold . insulin inhibits this foxo-1-induced luciferase activity, while sensitivity to  <dig> μm chir <dig> is completely lost in the presence of co-expressed foxo- <dig> . the concentration of foxo- <dig> used is less than maximal for induction of the bp- <dig> wt. this data suggests that foxo- <dig> overexpression desensitises the tire to chir <dig> and therefore that gsk- <dig> does not significantly regulate foxo- <dig> activity.

discussion
gsk- <dig> activity is required for igfbp- <dig> promoter activity through direct regulation of the tire
this study demonstrates that six agents, of four different chemical classes, which share an ability to inhibit gsk- <dig> mimic the effect of insulin on igfbp- <dig> gene expression. this is reminiscent of the effect of lithium ions, sb <dig> and sb <dig> on two other insulin repressed gene promoters, pepck and g6pase  <cit> . indeed, a heterologous promoter containing the igfbp- <dig> tire , is also inhibited by chir <dig> . similar promoter sequences are important for the insulin regulation of the tyrosine aminotransferase  <cit> , aspartate aminotransferase  <cit> , irs- <dig>  <cit> , and hmg coa synthase  <cit>  gene promoters. our data would predict that all of these genes, and any other promoters containing a tire, are likely to be repressed by treatment of cells with inhibitors of gsk- <dig>  this provides an apparent paradox since we and others have found that insulin does not regulate every tire-containing gene promoter by an identical mechanism. for example, insulin regulation of the igfbp- <dig>  gene promoter requires mtor activity  <cit> . meanwhile, foxo- <dig> is a tire-binding protein that has been proposed to regulate these three genes. however, cells that stably overexpress foxo- <dig> show increased g6pase but not pepck expression  <cit> , and genetic manipulation of foxo- <dig> has differential effects on these three gene promoters  <cit> . these data demonstrate that distinct signalling mechanisms control the regulation of these three tire-containing genes. therefore, each tire structure may require gsk- <dig> activity for function but distinct signalling networks link each gene promoter with the insulin receptor. the common requirement for gsk- <dig> activity suggests that a gsk- <dig> substrate is key for the initiation of gene transcription for each tire-containing promoter.

inhibition of gsk- <dig> is required for full inhibition of the igfbp- <dig> tire by insulin
insulin induces pkb activity, promoting phosphorylation of ser- <dig> of gsk-3α and ser- <dig> of gsk-3β, thereby reducing total gsk- <dig> activity by between  <dig> and 80%, dependent on cell type. therefore, expression of a mutant gsk-3β with ser- <dig> replaced by alanine renders cellular gsk- <dig> activity insensitive to insulin  <cit> . indeed, expression of this mutant significantly reduces the ability of insulin to repress bp- <dig> wt , or the endogenous gene promoter , demonstrating that insulin requires to inhibit gsk- <dig> for full repression of this gene promoter element. similarly, four to five fold over expression of wild-type gsk-3β antagonises insulin repression of the bp- <dig> wt . although insulin will promote phosphorylation and inhibition  of this recombinant gsk- <dig> in cells, the overall activity remains higher than un-stimulated control cells. this suggests that insulin must reduce gsk- <dig> activity below a threshold in order to fully repress bp- <dig> wt. this is the first demonstration of an absolute requirement for gsk- <dig> inhibition in insulin regulation of gene transcription.

what is the molecular link between gsk- <dig> and the tire?
the gsk- <dig> inhibitors regulate igfbp- <dig> gene expression in the absence of regulation of pkb, map kinase, foxo- <dig> or mtor , known regulators of the igfbp- <dig> promoter. this suggests a more direct regulation of this element, possibly of a tire-interacting protein itself. there are numerous transcription factors that have been proposed to be substrates for gsk- <dig> in vitro and in some cases in vivo . these include β-catenin, c-jun, creb, glucocorticoid receptor  and c-myc. the phosphorylation of β-catenin  <cit> , c-jun  <cit> , gr  <cit>  and c-myc  <cit>  by gsk- <dig> promotes their destruction or reduces their activity, while the phosphorylation of creb  is thought to increase creb activity  <cit> , although this has been subsequently questioned  <cit> . since inhibition of gsk- <dig> reduces tire activity, one presumes that gsk- <dig> mediated phosphorylation of a tire-binding protein would result in its activation , nuclear localisation or stabilisation. this would seem to rule out β-catenin, c-jun, gr and c-myc in the gsk-3-mediated regulation of the tire. meanwhile creb does not bind directly to a tire in vitro. the only known gsk- <dig> substrates that have been demonstrated to bind to or regulate the tire are members of the caat-enhancer binding protein  family of transcription factors. gsk- <dig> phosphorylates c/ebpα at thr-222/thr- <dig>  <cit>  while c/ebpβ can regulate tire activity and is itself regulated by insulin  <cit> . the reported regulation of c/ebpβ by insulin is pi 3-kinase and pkb-dependent but is mediated through phosphorylation of the co-regulator protein p300/cbp  <cit> . we are currently examining whether the gsk- <dig> inhibitors regulate c/ebp and p <dig> phosphorylation and/or activity. meanwhile, granner and colleagues have found that insulin treatment of h4iie cells increases the cellular levels of lip   <cit> . lip subsequently replaces lap  on the endogenous pepck promoter. this prevents the recruitment of rna polymerase ii and p300/cbp, eventually leading to the repression of pepck gene expression. however, the lip/lap interacting elements within the pepck promoter are distinct from the tire  <cit> . finally, our data suggests that the effect of gsk- <dig> inhibitors is independent of regulation of foxo- <dig> , the best characterised tire-binding protein. therefore, much more work will be required to identify the gsk- <dig> substrate that regulates this dna element.

gsk- <dig> inhibitors as therapeutics
agents that mimic the physiological processes that are regulated by insulin have the potential to be of therapeutic value for the treatment of insulin resistant states such as diabetes. lithium chloride, sb <dig>  sb <dig> and chir <dig> inhibit gsk- <dig> and therefore mimic many of the actions of insulin. for instance, lithium chloride stimulates glucose transport and glycogen synthesis in adipocyte and muscle cell lines  <cit> , while sb <dig> and sb <dig> stimulate glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes  <cit> . meanwhile, chir <dig> potentiates insulin activation of glucose transport and utilisation in vitro and in vivo  <cit> , and related compounds reduce muscle insulin resistance  <cit>  in animal models of diabetes. we have found that gsk- <dig> inhibitors also mimic the ability of insulin to repress key metabolic genes such as pepck, g6pase and igfbp- <dig> . studies in animal models of diabetes suggest that these agents alleviate hyperglycaemia through both activation of glycogen synthesis and inhibition of hepatic glucose production  <cit> . however, a vast number of biological processes are known to be regulated by gsk- <dig>  thereby questioning their long term use as regulators of glucose homeostasis. importantly, gsk- <dig> associates with and regulates proteins linked to the development of colonic cancer . meanwhile, ablation of one of the two genes for gsk- <dig>  in mice proved to be fatal due to increased hepatic sensitivity to tnfα-induced apoptosis  <cit> . despite all of the potential problems that may be associated with gsk- <dig> inhibitors, deleterious effects of such compounds in animals remain to be formally reported. currently, gsk- <dig> inhibitors are being investigated for the treatment of numerous psychiatric disorders  <cit> , neurodegeneration  <cit>  and even hair loss  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the work presented herein demonstrates for the first time that inhibition of gsk- <dig> is required for complete insulin regulation of igfbp- <dig>  while we have identified the dna element by which gsk <dig> targets this gene promoter. as such, gsk- <dig> inhibition will mimic the insulin regulation of igf <dig> bio-availability, as well as reducing the expression of hepatic gluconeogenic genes. it remains to be seen how many other insulin-regulated  gene promoters are sensitive to these inhibitors.
