BACKGROUND
neisseria meningitidis is one of the major causative agents of bacterial meningitis and septicemia in children and young adults  <cit> . periodically, it causes large epidemics in africa, especially in the sub-saharan meningitis belt, and in asia  <cit> ; however, it is still a serious problem in many industrialized countries  <cit> . occasionally, a meningococcal pandemic occurs after large population movements, such as pilgrimages  <cit> .

epidemiological studies of n. meningitidis, using various subtyping methods, allow the identification of a disease outbreak and investigation of the disseminating meningococcal strains. with the advent of molecular biology, a number of molecular methods have been developed for epidemiological studies of n. meningitidis. among the methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  and multilocus sequence typing  are the most frequently used subtyping techniques  <cit> . pfge usually exhibits high discrimination for bacterial isolates, but it generates fingerprint image data that makes a comparison between laboratories difficult. in contrast, mlst is based on sequence data from seven conserved housekeeping genes; sequences that differ at even a single nucleotide are assigned to different alleles. the combination of alleles at the seven housekeeping genes is designated the sequence type  of the isolate; numerous sts can be obtained. a neisseria mlst database has been established that allows sts to be compared electronically via the internet. sts are grouped into clonal complexes by their similarity to a central allelic profile . these central genotypes are identified by a number of heuristic means, including burst and split decomposition, along with feedback from public health laboratories and epidemiologists. once a central genotype has been identified, clonal complexes are defined as including any st that matches the central genotype at four or more loci unless it more closely matches another central genotype  <cit> . the accumulation of nucleotide changes in housekeeping genes is a relatively slow process, and the allelic profile of a meningococcal strain is stable over time. therefore, mlst is a powerful tool for study of global epidemiology of meningococci  <cit> . however, mlst provides lower discrimination than pfge for fine typing of some clonal groups of n. meningitidis  <cit> .

in recent years, the multilocus variable-number tandem repeat  analysis  technique has been developed for fine typing of many bacterial species  <cit> ]. in addition, yazdankhah et al.  <cit>  have recently developed a mlva method with four vntr loci for genotyping of n. meningitidis isolates and successfully differentiated the serogroup w <dig> isolates from sporadic cases and outbreaks. in this study, we successfully developed a mlva method with  <dig> vntr loci to analyze a panel of n. meningitidis isolates, which had previously been characterized by pfge and mlst.

RESULTS
identification of potential vntr loci
initially,  <dig> potential vntr loci with short lengths of repeat units  were selected from a list of repeat loci identified by the vntrdb program at the three genomes of n. meningitidis strains z <dig>  mc <dig> and fam <dig>  after evaluation with  <dig> genetically distinct n. meningitidis strains,  <dig> vntr loci were then chosen for genotyping  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates. the remaining  <dig> vntr loci were abandoned because multiple bands were produced or no pcr products were detected in all the  <dig> isolates. four of the  <dig> loci were opa genes, which existed in multiple copies with various repeat numbers in neisseria spp.  <cit> . such loci were too complicated to be useful for mlva genotyping. among the  <dig> loci, three  have been characterized by yazdankhah et al.  <cit> . both vntr <dig> and vntr <dig> loci, described by yazdankhah et al.  <cit> , are actually the same locus equivalent to the nmtr <dig> locus described in this study. in the genomic sequence of n. meningitidis strain mc <dig>  the primers vntr06-f and vntr06-r are at positions 286076– <dig> and 285626– <dig>  and vnrt08-f and vntr08-r at 285707– <dig> and 286018– <dig>  respectively. both primer sets amplify the same vntr locus. the lengths of repeat units for the  <dig> repeat loci ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> bp,  <dig> of the  <dig> loci were multiples of  <dig> bp. nmtr <dig> is a compound tandem repeat with 12- and 13-bp repeat units arranging in variable numbers and sequences. this compound tandem repeat was verified by sequencing all the amplicons from  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates. of the  <dig> loci, at least  <dig> were located in coding region of annotated genes . the vntrdb program used each of the three genomic sequences in turn as a "parent" sequence to search repeat loci and, then, located each of the loci at the other two genomes, so that a locus, for example nmtr9a with only one repeat unit in strains mc <dig> but with  <dig> repeat units in strain z <dig> and  <dig> repeat units in strain fam <dig>  could be found .

mlva genotyping
the mlva genotyping was performed on  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates, which were collected between  <dig> and  <dig>  and their pfge patterns and st types were characterized previously  <cit> . the results showed that the majority of the isolates carried only one copy of each of the  <dig> loci; however, five isolates carried extra copy of nmtr <dig>  nmtr <dig>  nmtr <dig> or nmtr <dig> locus, two isolates did not carry the nmtr <dig> locus, and three isolates did not carry the nmtr <dig> locus . the number of alleles at each of the  <dig> loci ranged from  <dig> to  <dig> alleles counted on the  <dig> isolates analyzed . six loci  had more than  <dig> alleles and four loci  had a high allelic polymorphism index  . based on the allele number for each of the  <dig> loci determined in this study, at least  <dig> ×  <dig> mlva allelic profiles  are expected.

a total of  <dig> mlva types were identified for the  <dig> isolates . the majority of mlva types represented only one isolate; however, each tw <dig>  tw <dig>  tw <dig>  tw <dig>  and tw <dig> types represented two isolates and tw <dig> represented three isolates. tw <dig> was identified in two serogroup b isolates , which were obtained from two cases in a meningococcal disease outbreak in a family. tw <dig> was identified in two serogroup c isolates  with a close epidemiological relationship. tw <dig>  tw <dig>  and tw <dig> were identified in serogroup y isolates collected from sporadic cases; the isolates were derived from a newly imported clone  <cit> . the two serogroup w <dig> isolates with tw <dig> type were collected in cases at a 2-year interval.

as shown in the previous study  <cit> , pfge exhibited a higher degree of discrimination than mlst for the isolates analyzed. however, the results of this study showed that mlva exhibited much higher resolution than pfge on the same panel of isolates. mlva discriminated all of the serogroup b isolates and  <dig> of  <dig> serogroup w <dig> isolates, which were collected from sporadic cases . in contrast, only two st type and four pfge patterns were identified in the  <dig> serogroup w <dig> isolates . only one st type and two pfge patterns were identified in the  <dig> serogroup y isolates . however, these isolates were further discriminated into seven mlva genotypes.

phylogenetic analysis
the clonal relationships among the  <dig> isolates were constructed with the mlva types by the minimal spanning tree  method. in the analysis with  <dig> loci, mlva types matching at eight or more loci were regarded as clonally related. consequently, eight distinct mlva groups were established and the grouping feature established with the mlva types had good agreement with that built with st types . the two serogroup a isolates were characterized as different mlva types , differing in three loci, both carried st- <dig> type within the st- <dig> complex . similar to the results obtained from the previous mlst analysis, a complicated clonal relationship was found among the  <dig> serogroup b isolates. the majority of mlva types were distributed in three major mlva groups, t <dig>  t <dig> and t <dig>  and  <dig> types were regarded as single clonal lineages. t <dig> group comprised  <dig> mlva types: isolates within this group and with tw <dig>  carried st types belonging to the st- <dig> group. similar to the t <dig> group, the t <dig> group comprised  <dig> mlva types and all the isolates in this group belonged to the st- <dig> group. with the exception of tw <dig>  isolates with the mlva types within t <dig> group belonged to the st-41/ <dig> complex. in the mst analysis with st types, some isolates were grouped in the st-41/ <dig> complex, but with mlva allelic profiles they  were separated from the t <dig> group. however, they had a closer genetic relationship with the genotypes within the t <dig> group.

all the mlva types, except tw <dig> and tw <dig>  representing the serogroup w <dig> isolates, were clustered in t <dig> group. the two mlva types , identified in three serogroup c isolates, had a closer clonal relationship with the w <dig> isolates than other serogroup isolates, although they differed at five loci with the closest mlva types within the t <dig> group. a total of  <dig> mlva types were identified in the  <dig> serogroup w <dig> and three serogroup c isolates; in contrast, only two st types  were found in the isolates . the isolates with tw <dig> and tw <dig> types emerged in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. since tw <dig> and tw <dig> differed in as many as seven loci, the two mlva strains should not be derived from a common imported strain.

the serogroup y isolates shared a close clonal relationship as the seven mlva types, forming a compact cluster. six mlva types differed in only one or two loci with the founder type, tw <dig>  which was identified in the earliest collected isolates in taiwan.

mlva allelic profiles of isolates from patient-contact episodes
five isolates, collected from healthy contacts of four patients were characterized by mlva. the mlva profiles were identical for isolates from three episodes. two isolates from the fourth episode differed in a single locus, nmtr- <dig> .

discussion
our data demonstrate that the mlva method is powerful for subtyping and useful for phylogenetic investigation of n. meningitidis isolates. the mlva exhibited a much higher discriminatory power than pfge for the isolates tested and the resulting data agreed well with the epidemiological observations. of the  <dig> n. meningitidis isolates characterized,  <dig> were collected from sporadic cases with no apparently epidemiological links. this mlva method with  <dig> vntr loci discriminated, not only all the genetically diversified serogroup b isolates, but also exhibited a high degree of resolution for the serogroup w <dig> isolates. although serogroup w <dig> meningococci emerged in taiwan before  <dig>  only four pfge patterns, sharing a high pattern similarity, were identified in the  <dig> isolates collected from  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . however, mlva differentiated the  <dig> isolates into  <dig> genotypes. mlva data also supported the belief that serogroup y meningococci were derived from a recently emerging clone in taiwan. serogroup y meningococci emerged for the first time in  <dig> in taiwan; the  <dig> isolates collected in  <dig> to  <dig> were tightly clustered together. the clustering feature supported the observation that the serogroup y clone was recently introduced into this country. mlva genotyping also showed that there were no a major epidemic n. meningitidis strain circulating in the country, where meningococcal disease was infrequent.

our study showed that the clonal relationships between the isolates, established with mlva types, was in good agreement with those built with st types. as shown on figure  <dig>  strains within a st complex or st group shared more common vntr loci. among the  <dig> loci, four  were highly polymorphic; they could have higher variation rates. the remaining loci could have moderate and low variation rate. thus, different sets of vntr loci may be useful for phylogenetic investigation of isolates evolving over different time scales. phylogenetic investigations of spreading of n. meningitidis strains over a long time scale will best be carried out using loci with a low or moderate variation rate. forensics and outbreak investigations may use loci with a higher variation rate. in our study, the mst grouping features built with  <dig> or  <dig> loci, which excluded one or two highly polymorphic loci, such as nmtr <dig>  nmtr <dig> or both from  <dig> loci, remained similar but tighter to that with  <dig> loci . therefore, use of more vntr loci with a lower variation rate will increase the power of mlva in phylogenetic studies of n. meningitidis strains evolving over a long time scale.

the allelic profiles of the  <dig> serogroup y isolates demonstrated the level of stability for the  <dig> vntr loci. the comparison of the allelic profiles indicated that vntr <dig> had the highest variation rate; five additional alleles at nmtr <dig>  but only one at nmtr <dig>  nmtr <dig> and nmtr <dig>  evolved in the serogroup y isolates over a 2-year time span. the stability of the vntr loci was also demonstrated by the comparison of the allelic profiles of isolates from four patient-contact episodes. although a single locus variant was observed in isolates from a patient-contact episode , this mlva method should be stable enough for forensic and outbreak investigations. since variation normally occurs in only a small portion of isolates from an outbreak  <cit> , such variation is usually not a problem for interpretation of mlva data.

the mlva is useful for identification of outbreak strains. in our record, there was no serogroup c meningococcus identified in 1996– <dig>  a serogroup c isolate  was identified for the first time in  <dig> and two  in  <dig>  although the three isolates differed in pfge patterns, they had the same st- <dig> type  <cit> . therefore, the  <dig> isolates were considered deriving from the  <dig> strain. however, tw <dig> and tw <dig> differed in seven loci, including the high polymorphic loci  and three moderate polymorphic loci . mlva profiles suggested that the two mlva strains should not derive from a common imported strain. in contrast with, mlva results suggested that the serogroup y isolates were evolved from a newly imported clone; strains derived from the clone still caused infections in  <dig> to  <dig> with 2– <dig> patients a year.

to date, in our study and that of yazdankhah et al.  <cit> , a total of  <dig> vntr loci have been characterized, and more could still exist in the genomes. for example, jordan et al.  <cit>  identified  <dig> coding tandem repeat loci that varied in numbers of repeat units between the three sequenced strains, of which only five loci were included in this study. although the rest of the loci may have lower allelic polymorphism, they may be included in the vntr set suitable for phylogenetic investigation of n. meningitidis strains.

of the  <dig> loci, five were not with repeat units of multiples of  <dig> bp. however, it is not necessary that a repeat unit needs to be of multiples of  <dig> bp for having a biological function. for example, nmtr <dig> locus, having a 7-bp repeat unit, is located within the coding sequence of the glycosyltransferase  gene that involves in pilin glycosylation and phase variation  <cit> . tandem repeat sequences or repeat sequence tracts are usually involved in diverse biological functions; to date, more than  <dig> repeat associated phase-variable genes in neisseria spp. have been identified  <cit> . repeat loci may locate within the coding region of a gene or in the non-coding region involved in gene regulation  <cit> . the biological function of nmtr <dig>  nmtr <dig> and nmtr <dig> has not been elucidated. nmtr <dig> is a compound repeat locus with 12- and 13-bp repeat units; the two repeat units arranged in variable numbers and sequences. further investigation is needed to explore the biological functions associated with these repeat loci.

CONCLUSIONS
mlva exhibits a higher degree of resolution than pfge for fine typing of n. meningitidis isolates and produces portable data that can easily be used for comparisons between laboratories via the internet. mlva data can also be used to investigate phylogenetic relationship between n. meningitidis strains. therefore, mlva can be adopted as an epidemiological tool for forensics and disease outbreak investigations, and for investigating clonal relationship among meningococcal strains. however, the mutation rate for each vntr loci is still unknown. to fully exploit the value of mlva, more vntr loci need to be explored and more n. meningitidis isolates, of known epidemiological history, need to be characterized.
