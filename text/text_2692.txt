BACKGROUND
physicians treating patients with cystic fibrosis  are increasingly faced with infections caused by multidrug-resistant strains. pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus are the most common bacterial pathogens isolated from the cf respiratory tract where they cause persistent infections associated with a more rapid decline in lung function and survival  <cit> . in recent years, however, there has been an increasing number of reports on potentially emerging and challenging pathogens, probably due to improved laboratory detection strategies and to selective pressure exerted on bacterial populations by the antipseudomonal antibiotic therapy  <cit> . in this respect, both the overall prevalence and incidence of intrinsically antibiotic-resistant stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolations from cf respiratory tract secretions have been recently reported  <cit> .

efforts to treat cf infections are also hampered by the high microbial adaptation to the cf pulmonary environment, resulting in an increased ability to form biofilms intrinsically resistant to therapeutically important antibiotics such as aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and tetracycline  <cit> .

novel antimicrobial agents that could replace or complement current therapies are consequently needed to fight chronic infections in cf patients.

antimicrobial peptides  are naturally occurring molecules of the innate immune system that play an important role in the host defence of animals and plants  <cit> . over the last years, natural amps have attracted considerable interest for the development of novel antibiotics for several reasons  <cit> : i) the broad activity spectrum, comprised multiply antibiotic-resistant bacteria; ii) the relative selectivity towards their targets ; iii) the rapid mechanism of action; and, above all, iv) the low frequency in selecting resistant strains. although the antimicrobial activity of amps has been extensively reported in literature  <cit> , only few studies have been reported with respect to cf pathogens  <cit> .

hence, in an attempt to evaluate the therapeutic potential of amps in the management of cf lung infections, for the first time in the present study three cationic α-helical amps - two cathelicidins of bovine origin  and the artificial peptide p <dig> - were tested for their in vitro antibacterial effectiveness, as well as their in vitro anti-biofilm activity, against selected s. aureus, p. aeruginosa, and s. maltophilia strains collected from cf patients. the efficacy of the amps was compared to that of tobramycin, selected as the antibiotic of choice used for chronic suppressive therapy in cf patients.

since the conditions present in the cf patients’ airway surface liquid could counteract the potency of antibiotics such as tobramycin  <cit> , in the present study all in vitro antimicrobial assays were carried out under experimental conditions simulating the physical-chemical properties observed in cf lung environment  <cit> .

RESULTS
phenotypic features and clonal relatedness of cf strains
a total of  <dig> out of  <dig> p. aeruginosa strains tested showed mucoid phenotype on mha, while  <dig> exhibited scv phenotype. among  <dig> s. aureus isolates tested,  <dig> were methicillin-resistant.

pfge analysis showed  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> different pulsotypes among s. aureus, s. maltophilia, and p. aeruginosa isolates, respectively. among s. aureus isolates, only the pfge type  <dig> was shared by multiple strains, which comprised  <dig> isolates and  <dig> pfge subtypes. among s. maltophilia isolates,  <dig> multiple-strains pfge types were observed: pfge type  <dig> , and pfge type  <dig> . among p. aeruginosa isolates,  <dig> multiple-strains pfge types were observed: pfge type  <dig> , pfge type  <dig> , pfge types  <dig> and  <dig> , and pfge type  <dig>  .

in vitro activity of amps and tobramycin against planktonic cells: mic, mbc
in order to determine the efficacy of amps, the antimicrobial activity was measured against  <dig> cf clinical isolates, and results are summarized in table  <dig>  overall, bmap- <dig> showed the widest activity spectrum among amps tested, as suggested by mic <dig> and mbc <dig> values , although all of them exhibited a species-specific activity. in fact, although amps showed comparable activity against p. aeruginosa, bmap- <dig> was found to be more active than p <dig> against s. maltophilia, and resulted the best active amp against s. aureus . compared to amps, tobramycin exhibited a lower activity  regardless of the species considered. killing quotient values, calculated as mbc/mic ratio, were <  <dig> for all amps, as well as for tobramycin, clearly suggesting a bactericidal activity. no differences in susceptibility levels to amps were found with regard to phenotype , pulsotype, or susceptibility to tobramycin .

a, bmic <dig> and mic90: mic  inhibiting  <dig> and 90% of the strains tested, respectively.

c, d mbc <dig> and mbc90: mbc  eradicating  <dig> and 90% of the strains tested, respectively.

only isolates exhibiting in range mic values were considered for killing quotient calculation : en = 24; fn = 12; gn = 3; hn = 6; in = 2; mn = 58; nn = 57;on =  <dig> 

mic and mbc values obtained under clsi-recommended or “cf-like” experimental conditions  are shown in table  <dig>  comparative evaluation of these values showed that mean miccf-like/micclsi and mbccf-like/mbcclsi values obtained for tobramycin  were significantly higher than those observed for bmap- <dig> , bmap- <dig> , and p <dig> , regardless of species tested, indicating a reduced antibiotic activity of tobramycin in cf-like conditions.

bactericidal kinetics
time-killing results have been summarized in figure  <dig>  bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig>  and p <dig> exerted a rapid bactericidal activity against p. aeruginosa, reducing the number of viable bacterial cells of at least  <dig> logs within 60 min of exposure. however, the bactericidal effect of bmap- <dig> against p. aeruginosa was incomplete for two  of the three strains tested, allowing bacterial regrowth after 24-h incubation, although at levels lower than those observed for untreated control. in parallel experiments, tobramycin showed only a bacteriostatic effect against p. aeruginosa, causing no more than 1-log reduction in viable count after 24 h.

bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig> and p <dig> exerted bactericidal activity also against s. maltophilia, although with streaking strain-specific differences. particularly, bmap- <dig> exhibited only bacteriostatic effect against sm <dig> strain, while p <dig> showed a rapid bactericidal effect against sm <dig> strain, causing more than a 4-log reduction in viable count after 10 min-exposure. tobramycin exhibited a late  bactericidal effect only against sm <dig> strain.

amps activity against s. aureus was significantly strain-specific, ranging from the rapid bactericidal activity of bmap- <dig> against sa <dig> strain, to the bacteriostatic effect of p <dig> and bmap- <dig> against sa <dig> strain. tobramycin showed a bactericidal effect against all s. aureus strains tested, although allowing bacterial regrowth of sa <dig> strain after 2-h exposure.

in vitro activity of tobramycin-amp combinations against planktonic cells
results from checkerboard assays are summarized in table  <dig>  fici values showed that all amp + tobramycin combinations tested showed an indifferent effect against p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia strains. conversely, bmap-27 + tobramycin  combination exhibited synergic effect against sa <dig> strain , while p19 + tobramycin  combination exhibited synergic effect against s. aureus sa <dig> strain .

a fractional inhibitory concentration index .

only isolates exhibiting in-range mic values were considered for checkerboard titration method: p. aeruginosa , s. maltophilia , and s. aureus .

in vitro activity of amps and tobramycin against biofilm
all cf strains were screened for biofilm forming ability on polystyrene. a significantly higher proportion of biofilm producer strains was found in p. aeruginosa and s. aureus, compared to s. maltophilia  . however, efficiency in biofilm formation was significantly higher in p. aeruginosa than in s. aureus, as suggested by median biofilm amounts produced  .

to determine if amps could be prophylactically used to prevent biofilm formation, we tested the effect of amps and tobramycin at sub-inhibitory concentrations  against biofilm formation . tobramycin at 1/2x and 1/4xmic caused a significantly higher reduction in biofilm-forming ability of s. maltophilia and s. aureus, in comparison with the three amps. this effect was more relevant with s. aureus, being observed also at 1/8xmic. tobramycin showed to be more effective than bmap- <dig> against p. aeruginosa at concentrations equal to 1/4x and 1/8xmic. the activity of tobramycin in reducing biofilm formation was not related to drug susceptibility . among amps, bmap- <dig> and p <dig> at 1/2xmic were significantly more active compared to bmap- <dig>  and bmap- <dig> at 1/4xmic was significantly more active than other amps against s. aureus.

we further evaluated amps as potential therapeutics for cf by testing their efficacy against preformed biofilms. to this, bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig>  p <dig>  and tobramycin at 1xmic and at bactericidal concentrations  were assayed against preformed  biofilms by six representative p. aeruginosa strains selected for high biofilm formation ability .

the activity of amps and tobramycin against preformed biofilms resulted to be similar in  <dig> out of  <dig> strains tested, causing a highly significant reduction of biofilm viability compared to the controls , regardless of the concentrations tested . amps showed to be active at all concentrations, also against biofilms formed by p. aeruginosa pa <dig>  against which tobramycin was effective only at the highest concentration used . the activity of tobramycin against preformed biofilms was not related to drug susceptibility .

discussion
this study was aimed at verifying the potential of some α-helical amps as lead compounds for the development of novel antimicrobials to treat lung disease in cf patients. to this, we tested the in vitro susceptibility of p. aeruginosa, s. maltophilia and s. aureus cf isolates to the naturally occurring amps bmap- <dig> and bmap- <dig>  as well as the rationally designed p <dig>  and we compared their effectiveness with that of tobramycin, the antibiotic of choice for the inhalation therapy of chronic airway infections in cf patients.

bmap- <dig> and bmap- <dig> are two cathelicidin-derived peptides of bovine origin that have a role in innate defence  <cit> . the hallmark of cathelicidins is the presence of a conserved n-terminal proregion associated with c-terminal antimicrobial sequences showing a remarkable diversity and considerable inter-species differences  <cit> . bmap- <dig> and bmap- <dig> are cationic  and both adopt an α-helical structure on interaction with the negatively charged bacterial surface  <cit> . recent results have suggested that amps with these characteristics may be the most effective against strains producing exogenous polysaccharides that are known to inhibit the activity of other types of amps  <cit> . for this reason, we added to our study also a third peptide from this class which has been rationally designed, making use also of non-proteinogenic aminoacids, to optimize its propensity to assume α-helical conformation  <cit> .

effort to treat cf are also hampered by the conditions present in patients’ airway surface liquid where the accumulation of large volumes of viscous sputum  providing bacteria with a nutritionally rich growth environment composed of host- and bacterial-derived factors which deeply change their phenotype and possibly their susceptibility against amps  <cit> . therefore, to accurately judge the feasibility of these peptides as potential anti-infectives in the context of cf, in this study we investigated the activity of amps under some cf-like experimental conditions, including acidic ph, reduced o <dig> tension, and a chemically defined medium mimicking the nutritional composition of cf sputum  <cit> .

these conditions allow pathogens to assume a physiology similar to that shown in vivo in the cf lung  <cit>  and constitute a more realistic model to assay their sensitivity to amps.

evaluation of mic and mbc values, as well as time-killing assays against planktonic forms of different cf isolates of p. aeruginosa, s. maltophilia, and s. aureus, have shown that all three amps are highly active in vitro against most tested strains, although bmap- <dig> showed the widest spectrum of activity. it is noteworthy that all the three peptides exhibited an activity higher than tobramycin. this observation is even more evident when considering the molar concentration  of each compound rather than that by weight , given that the peptides tested are at least six folds heavier than tobramycin.

the poor activity showed by tobramycin is probably due to the experimental conditions used in this study, as suggested by comparative evaluation of mic values observed in both “cf-like” and clsi-recommended conditions. on the contrary, the activity of amps tested resulted to be slightly enhanced , unaffected , or slightly reduced  in “cf-like” conditions, compared to clsi-recommended ones, so they can be considered to be quite robust and medium insensitive.

mbc/mic ratio clearly indicated that all amps exert a bactericidal effect against the cf isolates, in agreement with the known capability of bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig> and p <dig> to kill target cells by rapid permeabilization of their membranes  <cit> . results of killing kinetic assays confirmed this mode of action, although bactericidal activity against s. aureus and s. maltophilia was strain-dependent. again, the potency of amps was overall comparable or higher than that showed by tobramycin.

due to the different mechanism of action showed by amps and tobramycin, we investigated the potential synergy between them. interestingly, tobramycin exhibited synergy with both bmap- <dig> and p <dig> against planktonic s. aureus sa <dig> and sa <dig> strains, both resistant to tobramycin, thus suggesting that at least in these cases both amps may overcome resistance to tobramycin by facilitating the internalization of the aminoglycoside into the bacterial cells. further studies on a more representative number of s. aureus strains will be mandatory to understand the mechanism of this synergy and the feasibility to use these amps in association with traditional antibiotic treatments.

within the cf lung, pathogens cells grow as biofilms, which are inherently recalcitrant to antimicrobial treatment and host response  <cit> . even worse, it has recently been reported that some antibiotics may even stimulate biofilm formation at subinhibitory concentrations  <cit> . biofilm resistance is mainly due to the slow growth rate and low metabolic activity of bacteria in such community. for these reasons, amps whose mechanism of action makes them active also on non-growing bacteria, should be able to efficiently inhibit or prevent biofilm formation.

our results in fact indicate that the three α-helical peptides were all able to reduce biofilm formation, although generally at a less extent than tobramycin. in particular, all peptides reduced the capacity of p. aeruginosa, s. maltophilia and s. aureus to form biofilms when used at sub-inhibitory concentrations, with the strongest effects at about 1/2xmic values, while tobramycin was efficacious also at lower concentrations . this effect was particular evident with the isolates of s. aureus. interestingly, no planktonic growth inhibition was observed at concentrations able to reduce biofilm formation, and also amps with poor killing capacity against some planktonic cells showed anti-biofilm effects. these observations suggest that bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig> and p <dig> may interfere with biofilm formation by different mechanisms other than direct antimicrobial activity similarly to what observed with the human cathelicidin ll- <dig>  <cit> , and recently reviewed by batoni et al.  <cit> .

most cf patients are infected by p. aeruginosa whose persistence is due to the formation of antibiotic resistant biofilms in the lung  <cit> . our results showed that bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig>  and p <dig> were also as effective as tobramycin in reducing cell viability of preformed biofilms formed by selected strains of p. aeruginosa. at mic concentrations, and even more at 5xmic values, the two cathelicidins caused highly significant reduction of biofilm viability of all six strains of p. aeruginosa whereas tobramycin showed comparable results only for five isolates. it has previously been reported that extracellular dna is an important biofilm component  <cit> , and that in p. aeruginosa it is involved in cell-cell attachment and biofilm development  <cit> . due to the high affinity of cationic amps for dna  <cit> , it may be presumed that this binding might facilitate the detachment or disruption of otherwise-stable biofilm structures.

CONCLUSIONS
the overall results of this study shed new insights on the antibacterial properties of α-helical peptides, allowing the selection of those with the best properties to cope with lung pathogens associated to cf. bmap- <dig>  bmap- <dig> and also the rationally designed p <dig> may thus be considered useful not only as lead compounds for the development of novel antibiotics but also for compounds that may counteract bacterial biofilm formation and eradicate preformed biofilms, reflecting the modern understanding of the role of biofilm formation in chronic cf infections. however, before applying these molecules in the future for early prophylactic and therapeutic treatment of cf lung disease, further in vitro studies , as well as in vivo studies are needed to evaluate their therapeutic potential.
