BACKGROUND
most eukaryotic cells contain only a single nucleus because the karyokinesis in the m phase of the cell cycle is followed by cytokinesis. in certain cells, however, such as cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes, cytokinesis does not always occur, which results in cells containing two nuclei  <cit> . sarcomere assembly is a possible factor repressing cytokinesis in cardiomyocytes  <cit> , and insulin signaling plays a part in the generation of binucleate hepatocytes  <cit> .

the production of binucleate cells is thought to result from the repression of certain phases of cytokinesis, such as formation of the contractile ring and ingression of the cleavage furrow. cytokinesis occurs only when there is sufficient activation of rho gtpase at the division plane. after chromosome segregation, a prominent bundle of microtubules, called the central spindle, forms between the spindle poles  <cit> . the centralspindlin complex, consisting of kinesin- <dig> and rhogap, moves toward the plus ends of the microtubules, corresponding to the cell equator, and associates with rhogef  <cit> . the rhogef thus specifically activates rho gtpase at the division plane. rho signaling activates effector proteins, such as diaphanous and rho kinase, that in turn activate the formation of the actin contractile ring that completes cell division by pinching the daughter cells apart  <cit> . loss of this cytokinesis machinery results in incomplete cytokinesis and produces binucleate cells  <cit> . there is, however, no solid evidence that normal binucleation events are regulated by inhibiting the functions of cytokinesis components, and little is known about the key regulators repressing the formation of cytokinesis machinery during binucleation. on the other hand, recent studies have shown a link between binucleation and inhibition of the cytokinesis machinery in cancer cells  <cit> .

to investigate the mechanism by which cytokinesis is skipped during binucleation, we used as a model system the drosophila male accessory gland, which produces seminal fluid proteins promoting reproductive success, such as the sex peptide acp70a  <cit> . the exocrine epithelial cells in the male accessory gland, both the main cells and the secondary cells, are obviously binucleate   <cit> . we previously showed that binucleation increases the plasticity of the cell shape, thereby enabling the volume of the accessory gland cavity to change  <cit> , but the mechanisms of binucleation have remained unclear.figure  <dig>

in the work reported here, we investigated the binucleation event in the accessory gland primordia, which was characterized by synchronous entry into the m phase after a cell-cycle-arrested interval during the mid-pupal developmental stage following standard cell proliferation in the early stage. we found that the binucleation results not from cell fusion but from mitosis without cytokinesis. we examined the mechanisms of binucleation by focusing on various morphological features different from those of standard dividing cells. we propose that isoform-specific functions of the microtubule binding protein mud, a drosophila homolog of numa, are the key regulators in binucleation of the drosophila male accessory gland cells.

RESULTS
accessory gland epithelial cells are binucleated synchronously in the mid-pupal stage by mitosis without cytokinesis
we first determined whether binucleation of the accessory gland epithelial cells is a result of skipping cytokinesis . we observed the developmental stages and m-phase entry by using an antibody against phospho-histone h <dig> , a marker for m-phase chromatin. until 50 hours after puparium formation , the accessory gland epithelial cells randomly entered the m phase but did not produce binucleate cells  . that is, standard cell division occurred. subsequently, the cells arrested their cell cycle and delayed their m-phase entry for about 5 hours   . the secondary cells then entered the m phase at 55 hours apf  , and the main cells entered the m phase at 60 hours apf  . we also found that the mitotic wave for binucleation in the main cell population initiated at the middle zone of the accessory gland lobe and propagated to the proximal and distal parts . these results indicate a unique cell cycle regulation in this organ development. importantly, the synchronous entries into the m phase accompanied the production of binucleate cells . no cytokinesis was evident in this m phase . after binucleation, the accessory gland epithelial cells did not enter a subsequent m phase  but showed a single round of the s phase, indicated by pcna-gfp labeling , indicating that endoreplication occurred . thus the accessory gland epithelial cells, both secondary and main cells, became octaploid cells with two tetraploid nuclei. in the following section, we describe our examination of binucleation in the main cells. the secondary cells probably binucleated in the same way the main cells did.figure  <dig>

central spindle assembly and actin-contractile ring formation are inhibited during binucleation
we next identified the cytological differences between standard cell division and binucleation in order to obtain clues to the mechanisms of cytokinesis skipping. for this purpose, we compared cell division in the early pupal accessory gland primordium and binucleation in the mid-pupal one . we focused on the following three differences. first, during the standard cell division in the early stage of accessory gland development, the m-phase cells were apically extruded and rounded , as is widely found in the standard epithelia  <cit> . during binucleation, however, cells were retained in the epithelial monolayer and did not show rounding . second, the spindle orientation in standard mitosis was parallel to the epithelial plate   <cit> . the spindle formed during binucleation, in contrast, was always oriented perpendicular to the epithelial plate . third, in standard cell division, the central spindles between segregated chromatids arose from anaphase to telophase, and then an actin contractile ring formed at the division plane   <cit> . during binucleation, in contrast, the central spindle was not properly assembled . consequently, the subsequent formation of the contractile ring was also incomplete at telophase , although the cleavage furrow was slightly formed at late anaphase . on the other hand, other components of the mitotic spindle of binucleating cells looked normal, including the metaphase spindle   <cit>  and kinetochore microtubules   <cit> . also apparently normal in the binucleating cells was the m phase progression indicated by the relationship between chromatid segregation   <cit>  and the decay of cyclin b   <cit> ).figure  <dig>

forced activation of rho gtpase in binucleation stage produces actin contractile ring
looking at the above three differences for clues to the mechanism of binucleation in the experiments intended to produce artificially rounded cells, we saw that cell extrusion and rounding did not seem to affect binucleation. in the binucleation stage neither overexpression of sterile20-like kinase, which is related to cortical rigidity and cell rounding in standard cell division  <cit> , nor knockdown of the adherens junction protein de-cadherin encoded by shotgun  <cit> , which maintains epithelial stability, led to cytokinesis  . binucleation also seemed to not be affected by the orientation of the mitotic spindle. this is because disruption of vertical spindle orientation in the binucleation stage by using a mutant for the centrosome protein centrosomin or sas- <dig> did not cause ectopic cytokinesis progression    <cit> . on the other hand, in centrosomin and sas- <dig> mutants, weak assembly of the central spindle and an abnormal contractile ring could be observed at low frequencies . however, we found that these induction-of-cytokinesis features were observed even in the cells showing normal  spindle orientation. thus these results mean that contribution of the centrosome to the cytokinesis skipping during binucleation may be nonessential or even trivial.table  <dig>

mis-assembly of the central spindle and incomplete formation of the contractile ring strongly induced skipping of cytokinesis during binucleation. the formation of the actin-contractile ring requires sufficient activation of rho gtpase at the division plane  <cit> . to activate rho gtpase encoded by rho <dig>  we temporarily elevated the level of the rhogef pebble around the binucleation stage. pebble activates a rho <dig> signaling cascade that phosphorylates mrlc  encoded by spaghetti squash  to form the contractile ring  <cit> . overexpression of pebble resulted in f-actin accumulation at the cleavage furrow, a sign of contractile ring formation, and in furrow ingression during the binucleation stage  . we also found that overexpression of the activated form of sqh  induced the formation of the contractile ring  . furthermore, we tested a moderate overexpression of wild-type sqh or septin- <dig> to see whether cells in the binucleation stage have a latent ability to create a contractile ring. since the septin proteins are contractile ring components that act together with actomyosin and microtubules  <cit> , we could easily see contractile ring formation in the telophase cells  . these results indicate that the level of central spindle assembly in accessory gland cells in telophase was too low to sufficiently activate rho <dig> signaling for cytokinesis.

mud regulates central spindle assembly, spindle orientation and cell rounding during binucleation
the insufficient activity of rho <dig> signaling in binucleation is thought to be due to the insufficient assembly of the central spindle from anaphase to telophase, so we hypothesized that factors that repressed the central spindle assembly would be key regulators in skipping cytokinesis. moreover, as stated above, the reduced central spindle assembly during binucleation should be accompanied by a non-round cell shape and orientation of the mitotic spindle along the apico-basal axis. thus we examined candidate factors – such as mitotic kinesins   <cit> , microtubule-associated proteins   <cit> , microtubule-severing proteins   <cit> , par proteins   <cit>  and spindle orientation proteins )  <cit> , with regard to their effects on cellular phenotypes of accessory gland cell binucleation. we found that loss of mud disrupted normal binucleation phenotypes, including reduced central spindle assembly and other features of cell morphology during binucleation  . mud encodes the drosophila homolog of numa, which is associated with microtubules and plays a role in microtubule polymerization and determination of the spindle orientation  <cit> . in mud <dig> hemizygotes and mud-knockdown cells, abnormally clear central spindle assembly and contractile ring formation were seen even in the binucleation stage  . loss of mud was also associated with other morphological defects, such as abnormal spindle orientation and cell rounding  . we thus confirmed that one copy of a chromosomal duplication encompassing the mud gene region  rescued these defects  . these results suggest that mud contributes to various cell morphologies during binucleation. we considered its repression of the central spindle assembly to be a major cause of binucleation because in mud <dig> hemizygotes, we frequently observed cytokinesis progression even when neither horizontal spindle orientation nor cell rounding was observed  .figure  <dig>

mud represses development of central spindle during binucleation
we showed that mud repressed central spindle assembly and led to cytokinesis skipping. we made further observations of the central spindle assembly in wild-type and mud-knockdown cells in the binucleation stage. in particular, we used pav::gfp  as a marker for the plus ends of the microtubules in the mitotic spindle  <cit> . regarding the control results, during the standard cell division at the early pupal stage, pav::gfp was localized to the midzone of the central spindle at telophase, as reported previously . during binucleation, in contrast, we never observed pav::gfp-accumulated microtubules around the cell equator region . detailed observation of pav::gfp accumulation revealed that the impairment of central spindle assembly during binucleation was not due to impaired initiation of microtubule assembly. that is because the pav::gfp accumulation around cell equator at anaphase was similarly observed in the case of dividing cells, implying that the central spindle precursor could develop at early anaphase . but during binucleation, impaired microtubule bundling or destabilization of the microtubules was apparent at late anaphase . as a result, during binucleation the development of microtubules was insufficient for their interdigitation at the spindle midzone. we also observed that the contractile ring component peanut , a septin family protein, was localized around the cleavage furrow at anaphase but diffused during telophase . these results imply that the contractile ring begins to form during anaphase and is degraded during telophase.

we also checked whether the loss of mud affected the localization of pav::gfp during binucleation. in mud-knockdown cells, the localization of pav::gfp was restricted to the midzone of the central spindle . we also found that this localization was correlated with the central spindle formation. cells with partially assembled central spindles showed a partial localization of pav::gfp at the midzone , whereas cells with strongly assembled central spindles showed a clear localization . these results suggest that mud represses microtubule polymerization so much that microtubule filaments are not targeted around the cell equator.

isoform-specific functions of mud regulate various traits in binucleation
although mud is known to promote polymerization of microtubules  <cit> , our results showed that mud may be a negative regulator of spindle formation during the binucleation process. the above results also indicate that unknown functions of mud regulate central spindle assembly, spindle orientation, and cell rounding. interestingly, mud generates various splicing variants that have different c-termini . to understand the relationship between these unknown functions of mud and its structural isoforms that had not fully been analyzed, we compared the functions of three different splicing variants  : a pins binding domain -containing isoform , a pbd-lacking longer isoform  and a pbd-lacking shorter isoform . mudpbd is well-known major variant that regulates spindle polarity in a pins/lgn-dependent manner and promotes microtubule polymerization  <cit> . mudl and muds, both of which lack the pins/lgn-binding domain  , have not yet been examined and their functions are unclear. we thus expected that mudl or muds would exhibit novel functions that regulate central spindle assembly and spindle orientation during binucleation.figure  <dig>

to identify isoform-dependent functions of mud, we tested the ability of mudpbd, mudl and muds to rescue the various defects in binucleation in mud hemizygotes. overexpression of mudpbd  rescued only their abnormal spindle orientation , reducing the frequency of abnormal spindle orientation from 40% in mud4/y to 17% in mud4/y + mudpbd . overexpression of muds  rescued their abnormally enhanced central spindle assembly , reducing the frequency of central spindle assembly from 82% in mud4/y to 13% in mud4/y + muds . muds also partially rescued the abnormal spindle orientation , reducing the frequency of abnormal spindle orientation from 40% in mud4/y to 20% in mud4/y + muds . in contrast, the overexpression of mudl  effectively rescued the cell rounding phenotype found in mud hemizygotes , reducing the frequency of cell rounding from 30% in mud4/y to 12% in mud4/y + mudl . mudl also partially rescued the abnormally enhanced assembly of central spindle , reducing the frequency of central spindle assembly from 82% in mud4/y to 30% in mud4/y + mudl , but its ability was obviously less than that of muds . these results imply that mud has the following isoform-dependent functions during binucleation: mudl represses cell rounding and weakly represses central spindle assembly, mudpbd and muds each play a role in orienting the spindle axis along the apico-basal axis, and muds also strongly represses central spindle assembly.figure  <dig>

model for binucleation and isoform-specific functions of mud. schematic diagrams of cell division and binucleation are shown. in binucleation, muds changes mitosis from cell division to binucleation by  reorienting the mitotic spindle from horizontal to vertical along the apico-basal axis and  repressing assembly of the central spindle. mudpbd is also required at this time for orienting the spindle along the apico-basal axis. mudl, in contrast,  represses mitotic cell rounding and may assist in the process of cytokinesis skipping by  partially repressing the assembly of the central spindle.



muds orients mitotic spindle along the apico-basal polarity and inhibits cytokinesis
the above overexpression results suggest that muds contributes to cytokinesis skipping during binucleation more than mudl does, but the functions of muds during drosophila development have not yet been reported. we therefore tried to determine whether endogenously expressed muds actually regulates binucleation in the accessory gland. to do so, we performed a muds-specific knockdown   and found that the muds-knockdown cells showed abnormally enhanced assembly of the central spindle  and abnormal orientation of the mitotic spindle  . these results strongly suggest that muds represses central spindle assembly and orients the spindle axis vertically but does not regulate cell rounding.

mudpbd is known to regulate spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division, so we tried to determine whether the spindle orientation-regulating function of muds during binucleation is independent of that of mudpbd. we tried to do that by determining whether a knockdown of muds affected asymmetric cell division in the sensory organ precursor cells  on the adult wing margins . the spindle orientation of this asymmetric cell division is known to be regulated by mudpbd in a pins- and gαi-dependent manner, and loss of this function results in a multi-bristle phenotype on the adult wing . in fact, the knockdown of all mud isoforms caused abnormal spindle orientation and the multi-bristle phenotype    <cit> . the knockdown of muds alone, in contrast, did not induce the multi-bristle phenotype  , although it effectively caused spindle orientation changes during binucleation  . these results suggest that even though muds regulates spindle orientation during binucleation, it is not involved in the spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division of sops.

as shown above, muds seems to convert the mitotic morphologies from the cell-division type  to the binucleation type   . to examine this hypothesis, we tested the ability of muds to convert the mitotic morphologies of cells in the early pupal accessory gland primordia, in which standard cell division occurs. the results showed that the spindle orientation changed from horizontal to vertical . furthermore, binucleate cells appeared with some frequency . this effect of overexpression of muds on cell morphologies can be seen not only in the accessory gland but also in the wing imaginal disc . overexpression of mudpbd or mudl, in contrast, affected neither spindle orientation nor cytokinesis . these results suggest that muds can convert mitotic morphologies from the cell-division type to the binucleation type.figure  <dig>

discussion
regulation of m-phase entry in binucleation of drosophila male accessory gland
we characterized the final m-phase entry that contributed to binucleation of cells in the drosophila male accessory gland  . we showed that the entry into the binucleation stage took place with a two-step cell cycle transition: cell cycle arrest for 5 hours and subsequent synchronous entry into the m phase  . thus, standard cell division and binucleation are separated by a 5-hour interval of cell cycle arrest  . this may indicate that standard mitosis and binucleation have very different regulations of the cell cycle and cytokinesis. in fact, although in most tissues in drosophila standard mitosis can occur normally without the spindle checkpoint  <cit> , we previously demonstrated that the knockdown of mad <dig>  a spindle checkpoint component, frequently causes a defect in chromosomal segregation in accessory gland cells  <cit> . this is consistent with our proposal that binucleation is regulated by a system different from the one regulating standard mitosis.

morphological features of mitotic cells during binucleation
we identified three morphological features characteristic of binucleation: the non-round shape of mitotic cells, the apico-basal orientation of the mitotic spindle and the poor assembly of the central spindle . the reduction of central spindle assembly could directly repress cytokinesis, but we did not find the significance of the vertical orientation of the spindle or the non-round shape of the cell. we can explain it as follows. if most cells of the epithelium synchronously enter the m phase with the cell rounding phenotype, the stability of the monolayer epithelium may be severely disrupted. in fact, we observed a severe defect in epithelial stability after the binucleation stage in a mud mutant in which the cells were rounded during the binucleation stage . in addition, if the spindles in columnar cells are horizontally oriented, they will be less stable than they would be if they were vertically oriented because a spindle is aligned more stably along a longer axis than a shorter one  <cit> . vertical orientation of the spindle and lack of cell rounding may thus be appropriate for synchronous binucleation of columnar cells, but these morphological features do not directly regulate cytokinesis skipping.

mechanisms by which mud regulates central spindle assembly, spindle orientation, and cell rounding during binucleation
we propose that mud is a key factor in regulating binucleation. we demonstrated that mud functions in a way that represses central spindle assembly, orients the mitotic spindle along the apico-basal axis and inhibits mitotic cell rounding during mitosis . we found a clue as to how mud represses the central spindle assembly. in standard cell division, during late anaphase the microtubules of the central spindle are polymerized in order to target their plus ends at the cell equator  <cit> , and we confirmed this in our experiments in which the plus ends were labeled with pav::gfp . during binucleation, in contrast, the pav::gfp marker did not sufficiently target the cell equator . this implies that the polymerization of the microtubules of the central spindle is insufficient to target them at the cell equator, and the central spindle therefore does not develop completely. we also showed that the mud is needed in order to repress the growth of microtubules. in fact, the knockdown of mud promoted the growth of microtubules that targeted their plus ends at the cell equator even in the binucleation stage . however, the underlying molecular mechanisms of mud in repressing polymerization of microtubules remain unclear. moreover, the question of how mud regulates the mitotic spindle orientation along the apico-basal axis and how it inhibits mitotic cell rounding are also unclear. the logical next step will be to relate the isoform of each mud to various effector molecules regulating the orientation and the rounding.

alternative splicing of mud/numa produces three types of structurally different proteins
we showed that the three types of alternative splicing products mudpbd, mudl and muds have distinct functions from one another . it is known that the mud gene produces four isoforms  that contain the pins/lgn binding domain  and three isoforms  that do not contain it   . moreover, the three pbd-lacking isoforms are structurally classified into the following two types: a longer isoform  that simply skips the pbd-encoding exons by alternative splicing, and two shorter isoforms  that contain a shorter isoform-specific exon instead of the pbd-encoding exons  .

at least one of the pbd-containing isoforms  is functional and known to regulate the spindle orientation in a pins/lgn-dependent manner in asymmetric cell division  <cit> . in contrast, although mudl and muds are actually transcribed  <cit>  there is no evidence that mudl and muds are functional and have pins/lgn-independent functions. as in the drosophila gene mud, splicing variants also occur in human numa <dig>  and these variants encode a longer isoform , a shorter isoform  and a medium isoform   <cit> . although the functions of numa1-m and numa1-s are unclear, numa1-l has an lgn-binding domain in the c-terminal region and determines the spindle polarity in an lgn-dependent manner, the same as in the case of drosophila mudpbd   <cit> . numa1-m and numa1-s, in contrast, like drosophila mudl and muds do not have an lgn-binding domain in the c-terminal region . interestingly, we found sequence similarities between human numa1-s and drosophila muds in their c-terminal domains, including the shorter isoform-specific regions . these similarities suggest that muds in drosophila functions similarly to numa1-s in humans.

isoform-dependent functions of mud mediate various morphological changes of binucleating cells
we showed that the functions of mudpbd, mudl and muds are independent during binucleation. the repression of mitotic cell rounding was a mudl-specific function. in contrast, changing the orientation of the mitotic spindle along the apico-basal axis was controlled by both mudpbd and muds  . mudpbd was previously reported to be required for the spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division  <cit> . we showed, however, that muds is not associated with the spindle orientation during asymmetric cell division . on the other hand, the overexpression of muds but not mudpbd reoriented the spindle along the apico-basal axis in dividing cells . these results suggest that mudpbd and muds regulate the spindle orientation independently.

the function repressing central spindle assembly during binucleation was also shared by mudl and muds, but we showed that muds contributed the most to repressing spindle assembly. in fact, the overexpression of muds effectively rescued the mud <dig> mutant phenotype, the abnormally enhanced assembly of the central spindle  . in addition, like the mud <dig> mutant, a muds-specific knockdown abnormally enhanced central spindle assembly in the binucleation stage  . mudl, in contrast, only partially repressed the central spindle assembly during binucleation  . moreover, overexpression of muds, but not mudl, inhibited cytokinesis to produce binucleate cells in dividing cells such as the early pupal accessory gland cells  and the larval wing disc cells . this also suggests that muds mainly contributes to the repression of central spindle assembly .

CONCLUSIONS
we described the binucleation event of the drosophila male accessory gland during pupal development and analyzed the cellular mechanisms regulating this binucleation. we characterized a unique cell cycle regulation in the developing accessory gland: the m-phase entry for binucleation occurred synchronously at  <dig> apf after a cell cycle arrest for 5 hours. we also found that mud, the drosophila homolog of mammalian numa, regulated various features of the binucleating cells, such as a non-round shape, spindle orientation along the apico-basal axis, poor assembly of the central spindle and cytokinesis skipping. it is known that mud binds pins to determine the mitotic spindle orientation during the standard cell division or asymmetric cell division  <cit> . interestingly, we found atypical functions of mud that depended on three types of splicing isoforms, each differently regulating the above various features of binucleating cells. we concluded that mudpbd, which is a well-known isoform having a pbd  , oriented the spindle along the apico-basal axis. mudl, one of the newly characterized isoforms and simply lacking a pbd, inhibited the mitotic cell rounding and weakly impaired the central spindle assembly . muds, another newly characterized isoform, containing a shorter isoform-specific domain instead of a pbd-containing domain  , oriented the spindle along the apico-basal axis and strongly impaired the central spindle assembly . importantly, overexpression of muds induced an ectopic binucleation even in the cell division stage, whereas overexpression of mudpbd or mudl did not . these results suggest that muds is an important regulator triggering cytokinesis skipping in binucleation. abnormal expression of numa is known to be correlated with the production of cancer cells in mammals  <cit> . our finding of atypical functions of mud may contribute to the understanding of the relationship between numa and tumor progression.
