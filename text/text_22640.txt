BACKGROUND
in antibody-antigen  interactions, the paratope of the ab binds to the epitope of the ag. the identification of epitopes is an important step for understanding molecular recognition rules and is also helpful for diagnosis of diseases and for drug and vaccine design. the ultimate method to precisely define an epitope is to solve the 3d structure of the ab-ag complex either by x-ray crystallography or nmr  <cit> . these techniques are, however, demanding and generally time-consuming. faster epitope identification methods have been described such as site-directed mutagenesis of the ag  <cit> . another popular approach to map an epitope is parallel peptide synthesis  <cit> , based on the synthesis of overlapping peptides covering the entire ag sequence. in this case, mainly continuous  epitopes can be identified. screening chemical or biological combinatorial libraries  <cit>  for ab binders allows selection of peptides also called mimotopes  <cit> , mimicking more or less faithfully the epitope. bioinformatics tools have been developed to help experimentalists in localizing the epitope by the sequence analysis of the selected mimotopes  <cit> .

synthetic peptides are commonly used as immunogens to raise anti-peptide abs that may cross-react with proteins  <cit> , thus allowing their detection and quantification. these peptides are generally designed by using methods that attempt to predict antigenic determinants of a protein. numerous algorithms have been developed over the past  <dig> years. they are based on different theoretical physicochemical characteristics of the target protein such as hydrophilicity, flexibility, accessibility, and secondary structure, especially turns  <cit> . other methods are combinations of the latter approaches  <cit> , the most recent  <cit>  being an extension and combination of the methods of parker et al.  <cit>  and jameson and wolf  <cit> . likewise, welling et al.  <cit>  developed an antigenicity scale, with the aim of predicting antigenic regions and synthesizing the corresponding antigenic peptides to elicit abs reactive with the intact protein. all these algorithms have led to the development of several softwares or web interfaces that make the use of such methods very easy. it is, however, difficult to assess the efficacy of all predictive methods. a comparative study published some years ago  <cit>  indicated that the most accurate predictive method at that time is based on the prediction of turns. this method was implemented in bepitope  <cit> . a more recent and more exhaustive comparative study  <cit>  concluded that the methods based on sequence analysis do not predict epitopes better than chance.

all these methods predict antigenic determinants from the protein sequence alone, neglecting 3d structure information. this is surprising because the 3d structure of an increasing number of proteins has been solved by x-ray crystallography or nmr, and predictive modeling methods are available that show increasing accuracy  <cit> . recently, however, a few recent studies  <cit>  propose bioinformatics tools based on 3d information to predict epitopes.

in this article, we describe pepop, an algorithm that makes use of the 3d information of a protein to predict peptides which could serve as immunogens to raise site-specific anti-protein abs. clusters of surface accessible segments of the protein are first identified by pepop, and this information is further used to design the peptides. we analyzed how pepop clusters corresponded to structurally defined epitopes  and how abs raised against peptides designed by pepop reacted with the parent protein.

RESULTS
clustering of exposed segments of the ag
a- pepop features and outputs for clustering
we developed the pepop algorithm as a new method intended to identify peptide sequences that, when injected into animals, induce the production of abs that should recognize specific areas of a protein. from the 3d structure of a protein, pepop first identifies segments composed of accessible and sequence contiguous amino acids. then, these segments are clustered according to their spatial distances . clusters and their segments are then further used to design immunogenic peptides. the pepop interface was designed so as to provide both detailed information  and modifiable views of the cluster in the 3d context of the protein .

b- experimental evaluation of pepop capacity to predict antigenic epitopes
since there is a documented relationship between surface accessibility and antigenicity  <cit> , we first evaluated the correspondence between the surface clusters identified by the pepop algorithm on given proteins and their known epitopes. to this end,  <dig> ab-ag complexes for which the amino acids composing the discontinuous epitope have been identified precisely were studied . a detailed analysis was first carried out on hen egg lysozyme  because several structurally, well-defined epitopes have been identified  by x-ray crystallography . the pepop algorithm was run on the 3d structure of hel . pepop identified  <dig> segments of accessible residues which were automatically grouped into four clusters on the surface of hel . cluster  <dig> contains antigenic residues belonging to three epitopes . cluster  <dig> exactly matches the d <dig>  epitope and  <dig> of  <dig> residues of the d <dig>  epitope; it also predicts some of the antigenic residues of the hyhel- <dig> and hyhel- <dig> epitopes. cluster  <dig> perfectly matches the d <dig>  epitope and almost perfectly the hyhel- <dig> epitope ; it also predicts part of the hyhel- <dig> and hyhel- <dig> epitopes. cluster  <dig> does not correspond to any x-ray described epitope of the lysozyme.

 <dig> ratio of the number of amino acids in the epitope included in the cluster to the total number of amino acids in the epitope. the epitopes were defined as in the original publication . positions of the amino acids in the epitope included in the cluster are indicated in parentheses. the ratios are in bold for the major clusters.

next, seven additional ab-ag complexes were analyzed to extend these observations to a database of  <dig> crystallographic epitopes . pepop analyses were performed on the 3d structures of the ag alone, i.e., not complexed with the mab specific for the epitope studied because this is the most frequently encountered case. the distribution of the amino acids in the epitope among the clusters identified by pepop was analyzed, and the number of the amino acids in the epitope in the major cluster  was calculated. the results show that the experimentally identified amino acids in the epitope belong to a single cluster for the d <dig> , d <dig> , and hyhel- <dig> epitopes in hel and the 5g <dig> epitope in tissue factor, to two clusters for the d <dig>  epitope in hel and the jel <dig> epitope in the histidine-containing phosphocarrier protein hpr or to three clusters for the complexes bh <dig> – hemagglutinin, bo2c <dig> – c <dig> domain of fviii, nc <dig> – neuraminidase, f <dig> . <dig> – guinea fowl lysozyme , hyhel- <dig> – hel, hyhel- <dig> – hel, and n <dig> – staphylococcal nuclease . for example, all the amino acids of the epitope on hel recognized by mab d <dig>  are included in a single cluster identified by pepop , and  <dig> amino acids out of  <dig> of the epitope on hpr recognized by mab jel <dig> are included in the major cluster . table  <dig> shows that the specificity of the method ranged from  <dig>  to  <dig>   and the sensitivity varied within a broader range . the positive predictive value  varied from  <dig>  to  <dig>  . the same database of  <dig> crystallographically defined epitopes was used with two freely available web tools that also make use of the 3d information of the protein to predict epitopes . the results in table  <dig> show that both methods have similar specificity . their sensitivities, however, are slightly lower than that of pepop  and the ppv are again lower than that found for pepop predictions  . thus, performances of pepop compare well with similar, but not identical, algorithms.

design of peptides from clusters
a- pepop features and outputs for the design of immunogenic peptides
based on pepop prediction of clusters of surface accessible segments, the design of peptides suitable for raising abs potentially cross-reactive with the target protein can be achieved by different methods. to build in silico a candidate peptide, a segment, called a "reference segment", is first chosen, and its sequence is extended with a "method of extension" in a specified "area of extension" on the protein to yield the designed peptide. each of the reference segments, the method, and the area of extension can be selected among several possibilities. figure  <dig> illustrates the method of adding the nearest neighbor  segments to the reference segment to obtain a suitable peptide. peptides # <dig> and # <dig> in table  <dig> were constructed from the longest segment to which the nearest neighbor segments were added, according to two different methods . the software was developed in such a way that, at each of the three steps of the design of a given peptide, the user can choose the parameter  or let the algorithm automatically do it. by default, the reference segment is the longest segment, the method of extension is the addition of the protein sequence and in this case it is not necessary to select an area of extension. the peptide is therefore extended until the default minimal length of  <dig> amino acids is reached.

 <dig> amino acids in lower case are d-amino acids.  <dig> algorithm used to predict the sequence of the immunogenic peptide: b for bepitope otherwise pepop.  <dig> the reference segment chosen is the longest  or the segment at the top  of the list of all the segments ranked according to the five characteristics indicated in the text.  <dig> the method of extension chosen is either elongation with the flanking protein sequence ; addition of the nearest neighbor  segment regardless of the sense of the segment added: if the segment is in the unnatural sense, i.e., from the c-terminus to the n-terminus, it is synthesized using d-amino acids ; or manual design .  <dig> the area of extension is the cluster top of the list  of the clusters ranked according to the five characteristics , or the cluster containing the selected reference segment , or a user selected cluster , or none when the reference segment is the longest and the method is the fps.  <dig> positive reactivities in the indirect elisa are values over  <dig> , and strong reactivities are values over  <dig> . control experiments done by using the preimmune serum gave values ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . the given values correspond to specific absorbances .

b- experimental evaluation of the immunogenicity of designed peptides
to prove the capacity of pepop to successfully predict peptides that are able to induce abs able to recognize the cognate protein, several peptides were designed from the 3d structure of three model ags and chemically synthesized, then rabbits were immunized with these peptides , and the reactivity of the resulting abs with the cognate ags was measured. from the 3d structures of the ptp domain of ia- <dig>  the mpo-like domain of tpo, and il <dig>  pepop was run to predict clusters of surface accessible residues and to design peptides from them. several of the possible methods to construct peptides in silico were used although not all could be tested on the three ags, thus precluding a strict comparison of methods. nevertheless, five peptides  were designed from the ia- <dig> model, four from the tpo model , and two from the 3d structure of il <dig> . all but three of the peptides predicted by pepop have the longest identified segment as reference segment. the other three peptides started from the top-ranked segment either of the top-ranked cluster  or of a user-selected cluster . to predict the peptides, the simplest method  was first tested . then, the ability of the software to predict immunogenic peptides corresponding to a discontinuous epitope of the protein was experimented with the use of the nn method to design peptides # <dig>  # <dig>  # <dig> and # <dig>  the design process is illustrated in figure  <dig>  some other peptides were designed "manually", i.e., by using user-defined information . to evaluate the method, seven peptides  were predicted from the amino acid sequence of tpo and ia- <dig> by using the standard algorithm bepitope  <cit> . this method predicts peptides from the protein sequence, the corresponding epitopes thus being continuous.

synthetic peptides were prepared according to the designed sequences, then coupled to klh and used to immunize rabbits. to satisfy the predictive goal, anti-peptide polyclonal abs must recognize the predicted peptide and cross-react with the cognate protein. table  <dig> presents the reactivity with the cognate ag of the abs obtained by immunization with the different peptides . the best results  were obtained with peptides designed by the fps method since four out of five such peptides led to the production of abs that reacted strongly with the protein ag . only peptide # <dig> failed to recognize the il <dig> ag. peptides designed by the fps method of pepop led more frequently to strongly reactive sera than peptides selected according to the predictions of bepitope: two control peptides  induced an ab response of the same quality , whereas the five other control peptides  gave rise to medium-range reactivities , and peptide # <dig> did not lead to any significant ab response. the two peptides  that were "manually designed" as well as the retro-inverso peptide  did not lead to any significant ab response. two peptides out of the four designed by using the nn method of pepop gave intermediate cross-reactivity with the cognate ag reactivity . in summary, the simple fps method  proved to be very efficient to yield peptides which, when conveniently coupled to a suitable carrier, induced a strong ab response against the corresponding protein ag. except in a few cases, more sophisticated design methods  that tried to reconstitute discontinuous epitopes failed to propose peptides which had useful immunogenic properties. as compared with peptides designed from the standard method , pepop performed equally well or even better.

c- use of the pepop algorithm for sandwich immunoassay design
since pepop is able to predict immunogenic peptides localized on the surface of the 3d structure of a target protein, it could conceivably be used to select two candidate peptides that are structurally appropriately separated in the 3d model such that they would a priori generate abs able to react with the protein in a sandwich assay . as an example of such an application of pepop, figure 4a shows the localization of peptide # <dig> and peptide # <dig> on the 3d structure of ia- <dig>  peptide # <dig> corresponds to an α-helical part of the ptp domain of ia- <dig>  whereas peptide # <dig> maps to a hairpin in the juxta-membrane domain. these peptides clearly belong to spatially opposite regions on the protein. the resulting anti-peptide abs were used in a sandwich elisa to validate their capacity to simultaneously bind the cognate ag. the results  demonstrate the possibility to use pepop to target specific regions of the protein so as to obtain a pair of abs able to capture and quantify the protein of interest in solution.

discussion
this work was conducted in the context of an abundance of epitope predictive methods based on protein sequence information and a relative scarcity of methods using 3d information. since the majority of abs against protein ags binds to discontinuous sites, predictive methods should take into account structural information and try to guess the identity of discontinuous epitopes. this idea has recently been taken into account by a few groups of investigators  <cit> .

pepop is a two-purpose algorithm. on the one hand, it allows the identification of clusters of accessible surface residues and segments that might correspond to antigenic epitopes, and on the other hand, it is able to design peptides that can be used to prepare abs that target the cognate ag at specific sites on its molecular surface. from the 3d structure of a protein, pepop identifies segments composed of one to n continuous surface accessible residues. these segments are clustered according to their spatial vicinity: thus, the clusters are proposed to be putative discontinuous epitopes. segments and clusters are further used to design putatively immunogenic peptides. antigenicity is the ability of a protein to bind specifically to the paratope of an ab. immunogenicity is the ability of an ag to induce an immune response in a suitable host. thus, antigenicity is just a molecular recognition phenomenon, whereas immunogenicity depends on multiple factors extrinsic to the sole ag  <cit> . in developing and using pepop, we have clearly distinguished these two properties and we show that the outputs of pepop could be used in both settings. as concerns antigenicity, one has to keep in mind that epitopes are in essence unpredictable since epitopes are not intrinsic features of proteins but exist only in the context of the ab that binds to it  <cit> . thus, what one generally predicts is at best a putative epitope to which an  ab might bind. our method, as all others in the same vein, is a tool that helps experimentalists to focus on a defined part of a protein for experimentally assessing its real antigenic character by measuring antibody binding to this particular part.

a key step in proposing a new predictive tool is the demonstration of its efficacy  <cit> . to evaluate the performance of an algorithm to predict antigenicity seems rather easy since it consists of comparing the predictions with known epitopes. the gold standard for comparison is an epitope, as defined by x-ray crystallography of an ab-ag complex since this method provides a comprehensive topological view of the epitope. however, it certainly counts as epitope residues, some residues which are not energetically involved in the interaction with antigen , and this may bias the comparison between predicted and epitopes defined by x-ray crystallography. the authors of the three reported predictive algorithms that make use of 3d information used different methods for evaluation of the algorithm performances. batori et al.  <cit>  reported results on a single ab-ag model, but they rigorously compared the performances of their software with that of sequence-based algorithms. as expected, their emt algorithm performed better than conventional methods  <cit> . to assess the performance of their discotope tool, haste andersen et al.  <cit>  compared its predictions with those obtained by the method of parker et al.  <cit>  and by a surface accessibility calculation. they also reported epitope prediction for a single antigen. the evaluation strategy developed by kulkarni-kale et al.  <cit>  was similar to the one we undertook. their rationale for prediction was also very similar to ours. it seems, however, that their cep algorithm tends to predict much larger antigenic determinants than pepop. authors of the fourth tool, the meps server  <cit> , did not present any validation data. the ability of pepop to identify putative antigenic regions on proteins was evaluated by comparing  <dig> structurally defined epitopes on a total of  <dig> different protein ags with the clusters calculated by the algorithm. the identified clusters were shown to correspond to a large  extent to structurally defined epitopes. in  <dig> out of the  <dig> ab-ag complexes analyzed, at least 50% of the structural epitope residues were found to be included in a single pepop cluster. in the last two ab-ag complexes , the predicted residues almost equally distribute into three clusters, thus yielding the lowest sensitivity numbers. it should be noted that our method being based on detection of exposed residues, residues buried in the structure that may participate to epitopes are missed. cep, emt and discotope also make use of the accessibility parameter in their calculations. the comparative assessment of sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of pepop, cep, and discotope showed that pepop achieves similar or slightly better performances than the other two algorithms.

as regards to immunogenicity, assessing the performance of a tool to predict immunogenic peptides is more difficult because it implies time consuming experiments, notably immunizing animals. as others  <cit> , we have made this effort. to demonstrate the ability of pepop to successfully predict immunogenic peptides, several peptides were designed from the 3d structure of three model ags using different methods; they were then chemically synthesized and used to elicit abs in rabbits. since all peptides induced a strong anti-peptide antibody response  and not all antibodies recognized the cognate protein, it was assumed that antibodies did not cross-react with a denatured antigen. the capacity of the abs to cross-react with the target ag was taken as proof of a successful prediction. the fps method of peptide design was found to be efficient to yield peptides able to induce a strong ab response against the cognate protein ag since an 80% success rate was achieved. the fps method provides a peptide with a sequence made from contiguous residues of the protein, thus the 3d information is lost. however, as compared with peptides designed by using bepitope  <cit> , the fps method of pepop performed better. both pepop and bepitope use the β-turn criteria to predict epitope . pepop, however, uses four additional parameters, the length of the segment, its hydrophobicity, its accessibility as well as the occurrence of r, w, y, and p, that have been found to be overrepresented in protein-protein interfaces  <cit> . it is possible that this aggregated information might add some value to the prediction simply based on β-turn propensity. note, however, that the performances of bepitope have recently been surpassed by machine learning approaches  <cit> . a disappointing observation was that our attempts to design peptides mimicking discontinuous regions of the ags were not fully successful, in that the corresponding abs were poorly or not at all cross-reactive with the cognate protein. cross-reactive antibodies were obtained with several peptides , but their reactivity was low as compared with fps-based antibodies. chemically mimicking discontinuous protein surfaces have been a long-standing scientific challenge  <cit> . we are nevertheless confident that this could be amenable since many mimotopes have been identified that are considered as low molecular weight functional replicas of discontinuous epitopes  <cit> . as the pepop software has only recently been developed, many parameters can probably be improved to better predict discontinuous peptides. for example, the scoring and ranking of the segments can be adjusted and the combination of one to five of the characteristics deserves to be thoroughly tested. although pepop has proved its capacity to predict relevant clusters and immunogenic peptides, it still contains a great potential for improvement, particularly if a prediction → experimental validation → optimization loop is implemented. pepop is flexible and can be a useful tool for different purposes. for example, in an antigenic use, pepop can help to map an epitope by building up a small virtual peptide library that can then be tested for binding to the ab; should the ab recognize a peptide, the epitope is localized. pepop has also the potential to predict mimotopes, i.e. peptides without sequence similarity with the ag sequence which are recognized by the mab. mimotopes can have many applications and lead to pharmacological target identification , to protein engineering, vaccine design, identification of protein function, etc. as concerns immunogenicity, pepop can be used to target a specific region of a protein or to obtain abs that capture the ag. the need for mabs to characterize proteins identified by large-scale proteomic studies is ever increasing. since the protein itself is not always available, the interest in developing a method using peptides as surrogate ags may have great potential. an interesting feature of the pepop algorithm is its possibility to propose putative immunogenic peptides that could yield abs suitable for a sandwich capture assay of any protein ag that can be modeled. with the advent of large-scale proteomic studies and ab arrays, there is an increasing need for such immunoassays  <cit> . an ideal pipeline to fit these requirements would rely on novel high-throughput modeling capacities  <cit>  and bioinformatics tools like pepop to select peptides so as to obtain in a straightforward way pairs of surface-targeted abs for developing sandwich assays for diagnostic or discovery purposes.

CONCLUSIONS
pepop can identify epitopes at the surface of proteins with accuracy comparable to similar tools available through web interface. moreover, pepop can also be used to design immunogenic peptides from the 3d coordinates of the protein.
