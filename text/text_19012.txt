BACKGROUND
the transcriptional output from the genomes of prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms can be divided into protein-coding mrnas and non-protein coding rnas . most known ncrnas are relatively short, but longer messenger-like ncrnas  are being detected in increasing numbers  <cit> . like mrnas, these rnas are the products of rna polymerase ii, and are often spliced, capped and polyadenylated  <cit> . as of now, about one-third of the full-length cdnas obtained in mice and humans, respectively, appear to be ml-ncrnas  <cit> , and several of these have been found to play essential roles in vivo. for example, female mice heterozygous for an internal deletion in the xist gene undergo primary nonrandom inactivation of the wild-type x chromosome, indicating a critical role of xist rna for chromosome selection in x inactivation  <cit> . rna interference knockdown of the  <dig>  kb ncrna tug <dig> in the retina of newborn mice resulted in malformed or nonexistent outer segments of transfected photoreceptors  <cit> , and the activity of the transcription factor nfat is repressed by the ml-ncrna repressor nron  <cit> . however, most ml-ncrnas have not yet been characterized, and further elucidation of ml-ncrna function is an important project for future research on the transcriptome.

micrornas  are usually processed from primary transcripts  to precursor mirnas  in the nucleus by the rnase iii drosha  <cit> . pre-mirnas are about  <dig> nt in length and have a stem-loop structure with a 2-nt 3'-overhang  <cit> . the pre-mirnas are subsequently transported to the cytoplasm by exportin-5/ran-gtp, and are further processed by dicer to produce a ~ <dig> bp duplex mirna  <cit> . the duplex is unraveled by an unidentified rna helicase and one strand  is incorporated into the rna induced silencing complex  to guide post-transcriptional gene silencing  <cit> .

although about the properties of mirnas are rapidly being unravelled, less is known about the pri-mirnas. some pri-mirnas are thought to be produced by rna polymerase ii, and are capped, polyadenylated and spliced  <cit> . the genomic loci of a few ml-ncrnas overlap with known mirnas  <cit> , and whole-genome tiling array scans suggest that small rna loci commonly overlap with longer transcripts, the longer rnas possibly representing primary transcript of the shorter mature rnas  <cit> . the possibility thus exists that a fraction of the existing ml-ncrnas function as precursors for mirnas. in this study of mouse ml-ncrnas, we identified  <dig> ml-ncrnas encoding known mirnas , and developed a prediction procedure, primir, which predicted  <dig> me-ncrna candidates among the  <dig>  ml-ncrnas in the fantom <dig> data. for about half of these candidates we obtained experimental evidence for the existence of their corresponding mature mirna, and further analyses of both known and the candidate me-ncrnas show that such transcripts frequently share a common motif. our work specifies me-ncrnas as a special class of ncrnas, and suggests a role for these ml-ncrnas whose functions were previously unidentified.

RESULTS
 <dig> ml-ncrnas encode known mirnas
in the mouse genome there are  <dig> different pre-mirna hairpins encoding  <dig> mirnas . in order to estimate how many of the  <dig>  mouse ml-ncrnas  might encode a known mirna, we identified the positions of all these ml-ncrnas and pre-mirnas in the mouse genome  using blat and blastn, respectively. the result showed that  <dig> mirna hairpins are located in exons of  <dig> ml-ncrnas. of these  <dig> ml-ncrnas, three represent overlapping transcripts of different lengths that include the same pre-mirna stem-loop structure, thus encoding the same mirna .

computational analysis identifies strong me-ncrna candidates
to investigate how many of the ml-ncrnas in the fantom <dig> might actually be me-ncrnas, we developed the software primir to predict pre-mirna sites within the reported  <dig>  ml-ncrna population . primir first establishes a score matrix  to identify the stem-loops with the highest probability of being actual pre-mirnas. the score matrix is established on the basis of  <dig> sequence and secondary structure characteristics of stem-loops in the training and background sets . because hairpins in the training set often contain flanking sequences around the precise pre-mirnas, we annotated the exact position of the pre-mirna in each hairpin in the training set according to that of the corresponding mirna  <cit> . for short hairpins in mirbase we ran a blastn search on the genomic sequence to obtain the necessary  <dig> nt flanking sequences. in order to create a hairpin background set representing the distribution of  <dig> features of stem-loop structure sequences with random length, we randomly reduced the lengths of the hairpins identified in the ml-ncrnas. for each entry in the matrix, we calculated the ratio between the frequencies of each feature value in the training and background sets, and added it to the pms matrix. all entries in the matrix were calculated according to the definition . for a given feature i with the value j, fi and hi are the frequencies of this feature having the value j in the training and background sets, respectively. xi is the feature value set of feature i. if a given value j belongs to xi, aij is defined as the log  <dig> value of fi/hi. otherwise, aij was assigned the minimum value of aixi.

the next step was to predict the possible mirna-encoding ml-ncrnas. primir extracted about  <dig>  hairpins  from the  <dig>  ml-ncrnas. to pick out the most likely pre-mirna candidates we analyzed the conservation rate between mouse and rat for these sequences. in order to establish a threshold for the conservation filter, we aligned the  <dig> known mouse pre-mirnas in the training set to the rat genome using blastn. this resulted in  <dig> pre-mirna sequences  complying with two criteria: 1) the alignment lengths were larger than  <dig> nt, and 2) the identity of the alignment was 98% or higher. therefore, we used these criteria for primir filtration, and obtained  <dig> non-redundant conserved hairpins between mouse and rat, including  <dig> hairpins containing known pre-mirnas.

next, we used primir to predict pre-mirna candidates from these  <dig> hairpins based on the pms matrix. for each conserved hairpin, primir predicts a potential pre-mirna candidate and calculates a primir score based on the pms matrix. the primir score value s is defined as the sum of the scores of all features for a given hairpin:

 s=âˆ‘i= <dig> .11aixi 

here xi is the value of feature i.

to reduce the number of false positives, primir score "7" was used as a cutoff value. this is a stringent criterion, as roc curve analysis  of the primir performance showed that the auc  is approximately  <dig> , and that the false positive rate is  <dig> at a primir scores of  <dig> . we identified  <dig> pre-mirna candidates with primir scores of  <dig> or higher, corresponding to  <dig> potential me-ncrnas. among these me-ncrna candidates,  <dig> were included in set of  <dig> known me-ncrnas; thus, the remaining  <dig> represent novel me-ncrna candidates and altogether  <dig> me-ncnras were picked out finally.

to further evaluate the performance of the primir prediction software, we carried out cross-validation analysis , which gave auc values between  <dig>  and  <dig> , suggesting the prediction results are reliable. . during the course of this work, there were published three mirna prediction algorithms  <cit>  that were available for use on a local computer. a comparison between primir and these three algorithms suggested that the primir method is at least equal to and may in some respect outperform these three methods. furthermore, in order to get an estimate of which of the  <dig> stem-loop features contributed most to the identification of the pre-mirnas, we carried out a simplified analysis of this problem by investigating the effect of each feature when running primir on the positive and negative test sets . this identified five features with an apparently contribution: the number of paired bases in the 10-bp up- and down- stream extensions of the pre-mirna; the total bulge size of the pre-mirna; basepairs in the pre-mirnas; basepairs in the mature mirna and the minimum free energy of the pre-mirna.

experimental validation of the predicted mirnas
to experimentally validate the expression of the mirnas encoded by the predicted me-ncrna we spotted a microarray  <cit>  with  <dig> 26-nt probes corresponding to both arms of the  <dig> predicted pre-mirnas, and hybridized this to size-fractioned rna extracted from mouse tissues obtained from different developmental stages . the microarray gave positive signals for  <dig> probes , corresponding to  <dig> different pre-mirnas. of the  <dig> mirnas,  <dig> had already been registered in mirbase  <dig> , whereas the remaining  <dig> mirnas, corresponding to  <dig> me-ncrna candidates, are novel discoveries.  as an additional validation we carried out stem-loop rt-pcr  <cit>   of the  <dig> novel mirnas detected by the microarray, obtaining positive results for  <dig> of them .

the expression levels of the investigated mirnas appeared to be very low . to make a comparison to the corresponding me-ncrna expression levels we downloaded expression data for  <dig> different tissues for  <dig> of the experimentally supported me-ncrnas from the riken expression array database   <cit> . the analyses showed that the average expression levels of the me-ncrnas were similar to those of the entire ml-ncrna set, and that a few of the me-ncrnas are relatively high expression levels in a limited number of tissues , such as transcript ak <dig>  in pancreas, ak <dig> in thymus and skin at neonate day  <dig>  ak <dig> in liver and pancreas. thus, there appear to no strong correlation between the expression levels of the me-ncrnas and their encoded mirnas.

together with the  <dig> me-ncrnas corresponding to known mirnas, we altogether obtained a set of  <dig> experimentally supported me-ncrnas. given that the mirnas may be tissue or cell type specific, and/or only be expressed during a limited time interval or under specific physiological or environmental conditions, we regard the rest  <dig> as yet unsupported me-ncrna candidates. see table s <dig> in additional file  <dig> for more information on all the  <dig> me-ncrnas and candidates.

motifs of the me-ncrnas
sequence analysis of the  <dig> experimentally supported me-ncrnas revealed an internal motif  with the consensus sequence cnctgnctg , which was clearly more frequent in the me-ncrnas than in other analyzed sequences . to test whether this motif is also a feature of other mirna-encoding transcripts, we also searched for the motif in the vicinity of intron-encoded mirnas. although the motif do occur  in this context, it is far less frequent than in the me-ncrnas, possibly suggesting that this motif is a characteristic of mirnas processed from the exonic parts of their primary transcripts. for the entire ml-ncrna set we also found a very strong correlation between occurrence of im and the highest primir score of an ml-ncrna transcript ; that is, the likelihood of an ml-ncrna having an im sequence is related to the likelihood  of the ml-ncrna encoding an mirna. quite tellingly, for the set of  <dig>  ml-ncrnas with conserved stem-loops the correlation between primir score and occurrence of im is very low , most reasonably because an ml-ncrna with a conserved stem-loop has a high likelihood of encoding a mirna, and therefore also of containing an im sequence, irrespective of the typicality of its stem-loop characteristics .

structure and conservation of me-ncrna loci
for analysis of their conservation and gene structure, the sequences of the  <dig>  ml-ncrnas were mapped to the mouse genome . the gene structure of the me-ncrnas is generally more complex, with 44% of the transcripts being spliced, compared to 29% for the entire ml-ncrnas set. in order to evaluate the conservation of the me-ncrnas and ml-ncrnas, we assigned phastcons  <cit>  scores based on  <dig> vertebrate genomes to all base pairs in their corresponding genomic sequences, and average phastcons scores  were calculated as a measurement of conservation level . in accordance with previous research  <cit> , we found that both overall and stem-loop sequence conservation is weak  for the ml-ncrna set. in contrast, the overall sequence conservation for me-ncrna is relatively high , and for the pre-mirna hairpins the level of sequence conservation is striking .

the above analysis of the conservation of the me-ncrnas was based on the genomic sequence conservation of  <dig> vertebrates, most of which are evolutionally distant to the mouse. the conservation characteristics of the me-ncrnas between mouse and human were also analyzed. the me-ncrnas were aligned to the human genome using blat and defined as conserved between mouse and human if the coverage was more than 50% and the identity more than 90%. similarly, the pre-mirnas were aligned to the human genome using blastn and defined as conserved if the coverage was more than 80% and the identity more than 90% . direct sequence analyses between mouse and human only found that only  <dig> of the experimentally supported me-ncrna were conserved, and for a considerable fraction of the rest  not even their mirna-encoding stem-loop structures were conserved beyond the rodents; thus, me-ncrnas may for the most part encode species-specific mirnas in mammals.

estimated numbers of me-ncrnas
the above results as well as investigations in arabidopsis thaliana  <cit>  indicate that ml-ncrnas encoding mirnas may be a widespread phenomenon among eukaryotes. it is therefore of interest to get an idea of what fraction of the ml-ncrna transcriptional output might actually be me-ncrnas. the  <dig> me-ncrna candidates reported above were identified using very stringent criteria, and both the number of conserved stem-loop structures and the presence of the im would suggest that there may be a considerable number of me-ncrnas in the ml-ncrna population. to obtain an estimate of this number we built a simple model based on conservation of stem-loop sequences, primir score and the primir roc curve. among the  <dig>  most conserved stem-loop hairpins , there was  <dig> transcripts with a primir score of  <dig> or higher. according to the roc curve , this score indicates a specificity of 100% and a sensitivity of  <dig> , suggesting that there would be around  <dig> real pre-mirnas. considering further that only around 50% of pre-mirnas fulfill our stringent conservation requirement, this results in more than  <dig> pre-mirnas, corresponding to a slightly lower number ml-ncrnas. relaxing the primir cutoff value from  <dig> to  <dig> , we obtain  <dig> stem-loops. a primir score of  <dig> corresponds to a specificity of  <dig>  and a sensitivity of  <dig> , which would indicate about  <dig> ml-ncrnas encoding a mirna. thus, the number of me-ncrnas in the mouse could vary from a lower estimate of around  <dig> up to  <dig> transcripts.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
based on hairpin conservation and a comprehensive list of pre-mirna features, we have designed a computational procedure which detected  <dig> novel me-ncrna candidates in the mouse genome and provided experimental support for the expression of a substantial fraction of their encoded mirnas. through the above analyses we have shown that the me-ncrnas differ from other ml-ncrnas in gene structure and sequence conservation, and that their sequence and expressional characteristics are also different from other pri-mirnas.

the correlation between the internal motif and the primir score
an intriguing aspect of the analysis was the observed correlations between the presence of typical pre-mirna characteristics  and the occurrence of the internal motif im within an mrna-like ncrna sequence. for the entire mrna-like ncrna collection there was a very strong correlation between the im frequency and pms, however, in the set of mrna-like ncrnas selected for hairpin sequence conservation this correlation was far weaker, despite the frequency of im being higher in this set than in the entire mrna-like ncrna collection. there could be several explanations that would account for this discrepancy. the most straightforward is that the im is associated with the mirna encoding function of an ml-ncrna, and that the processing of a stem-loop hairpin depends on either its interaction with general pri- and pre-mirna processing factors , or on more specific factors . in the first case, the im would primarily be found associated with hairpins with high pms values, where in the latter case, conserved hairpins should have a relatively high frequency of ims, irrespective of pms value. as the majority of im-associated hairpins are not well conserved, this might imply that heavy reliance on sequence conservation may not be a particularly useful strategy for detection of a larger subset of me-ncrnas. the strong correlation between im and the pm score  in the full mrna-like ncrna collection therefore invites further work on computational mirna detection based on other sources than sequence conservation. however, the im sequence is quite short , and further analysis of me-ncrna sequences may reveal additional elements which could increase its predictive value.

biogenesis and function of the me-ncrnas
previous knowledge on mirna biogenesis assumes that pri-mirnas are processed into pre-mirnas in the nucleus by the drosha complex, and then transported to the cytoplasm where further processing by dicer occurs, resulting in the mature mirna  <cit> . the question of the sub-cellular localization of me-ncrnas has not yet been investigated, but a few primary mirna transcripts have been reported to accumulate in cytoplasm  <cit> , the fact that me-ncrnas are sufficiently stable to be cloned as full-length cdnas, and that they retain several mrna-like characteristics  would suggest that they may follow the path of coding mrnas and be exported to the cytoplasm. increasing evidence that post-transcriptional mirna processing is subject to regulatory activity  <cit>  and the apparent differences in the expression levels of the me-ncrnas and their encoded mirnas found here, further allows for a hypothesis in which me-ncrnas constitute a mirna storage form, possibly in addition to other functional properties of the intact me-ncrna transcript. this storage may be maintained through low transcriptional and degradation activity of the me-ncrnas, and producing only low levels of mature mirna release under normal conditions. upon some triggering event it could then enable a quick release of a larger amount of the mature mirna through me-ncrna processing without requiring transcriptional activation of the me-ncrna locus. this in turn begs the question of whether there might exist a cytoplasmic pathway for mirna maturation, or if the mature me-ncrna re-enters the nucleus for processing by drosha before the mirna is released. in any case, there is the possibility that me-ncrnas may have other cellular functions in addition to that of encoding mirnas, as found for a number of other ml-ncrnas  <cit> , and that they therefore exist in other cellular compartments and are maintained at higher steady state levels than pri-mirnas whose only role is to generate mature mirnas.

in fact, the phenomenon of long primary transcripts encoding shorter functional ncrnas is by not limited to ml-ncrnas encoding mirnas. whole-genome tiling array scans have revealed that many small rnas have genomic loci that overlap with longer transcripts, and the longer rnas may represent primary transcripts for the shorter mature rnas  <cit> . it is thus not implausible that a fraction of the ml-ncrnas may serve as vectors or storage forms for short ncrnas, which are then released when needed to perform their cellular functions. our finding that a considerable number of ml-ncrnas actually encodes mirna could suggest that serving as the primary transcript of various classes of short ncrnas may be a common function of longer ncrnas.
