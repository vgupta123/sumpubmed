BACKGROUND
helicobacter pylori  colonizes the gastric mucosa of human stomach for over half of the entire population. the majority of the infected people are asymptomatic with moderate inflammation. however, the infected people have a  <dig> to 20% of lifetime risk of developing peptic ulcer, and ~1% of risk of acquiring gastric cancer  <cit> . h. pylori-induced chronic active inflammation is characterized by the infiltration of various inflammatory cells, such as polymorphonuclear leukocytes, lymphocytes, monocytes, and macrophages, at the gastric mucosa  <cit> . helicobacter pylori neutrophil-activating protein , a major virulence factor of h. pylori, could play a key role in recruitment and activation of these immune cells during h. pylori infection.

hp-nap was first identified by its ability to promote the production of reactive oxygen species  by neutrophils and the adhesion of neutrophil to endothelial cells  <cit> . this protein is a spherical dodecamer composed of identical subunits  <cit> . each subunit is a four-α-helix bundle protein with a molecular weight of approximately  <dig> kda  <cit> . hp-nap released from the bacterium may cross the stomach epithelial cells and endothelial cells in the stomach  <cit> . upon encountering the neutrophils, hp-nap directly activates and recruits them to the site of infection  <cit> . in addition to the induction of ros production, hp-nap stimulates neutrophils to secrete several chemokines, including cxcl8/interleukin- <dig> , ccl3/macrophage inflammatory protein  <dig> alpha , and ccl4/mip-1β  <cit> , which can recruit and activate additional neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes. hp-nap also induces the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha , il- <dig>  and il- <dig> by monocytes  <cit> . furthermore, hp-nap is a potent immunomodulator to induce a polarized t helper type  <dig>  immune response and to trigger the release of proinflammatory cytokines, including il- <dig>  tnf-α, interferon gamma   <cit> . these immune responses induced by hp-nap may contribute to the pathological outcome of h. pylori infection.

despite its pathogenic role, hp-nap can be used to develop vaccines against h. pylori and novel therapeutic agents to treat cancer, as well as allergic and infectious diseases  <cit> . with regard to vaccine development, immunization with the multi-protein vaccine containing hp-nap, cytotoxin-associated gene a , and vacuolating cytotoxin a  in beagle dogs has a therapeutic effect to induce humoral immune response and reduce the colonization of bacterium in gastric mucosa  <cit> . this protein vaccine has been evaluated for its safety and immunogenicity in a clinical trial  <cit> . hp-nap has also been delivered by attenuated viral vectors as a recombinant protective antigen in mice  <cit> . these findings support the idea that hp-nap can be used to develop vaccines for h. pylori immunoprophylaxis in humans. in the development of novel therapeutic agents, recombinant hp-nap encoded by attenuated measles viral vectors has a therapeutic effect on metastatic breast cancer in mice  <cit> . recombinant hp-nap expressed from oncolytic adenovirus has also been shown to have an antitumor ability against neuroendocrine tumors in vivo  <cit> . furthermore, in a mouse model of bladder cancer implant, peritumoral injection of hp-nap reduced the burden and vascularization of the tumor  <cit> . in addition to cancer therapy, administration of hp-nap to mice inhibits the th <dig> responses in ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma and trichinella spiralis infection  <cit> . therefore, hp-nap is a potent immunomodulator to trigger th1-polarized immune responses for cancer therapy and to down regulate th2-mediated immune responses elicited by allergic reactions and parasitic infections. thus, hp-nap could be used in clinical therapy.

several methods for purification of recombinant hp-nap expressed in escherichia coli  in its native state have been reported. in these reported methods, at least two chromatographic steps, including gel-filtration chromatography, are required to obtain pure hp-nap  <cit> . however, recombinant hp-nap expressed in bacillus subtilis  has been reported to be purified by using one-step diethylaminoethyl  anion-exchange chromatography through the collection of the unbound fraction at ph  <dig>   <cit> . due to the low expression level of hp-nap in b. subtilis, the overall yield of recombinant hp-nap was not satisfactory. in our e. coli expression system, hp-nap was highly overexpressed  <cit> . since the endogenous proteins in different expression systems are different, we re-investigate whether the same approach can be applied to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli in one step. by optimization of the conditions for cell lysis and purification, we herein report a simple method using deae sephadex negative mode batch chromatography for high yield purification of recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli.

RESULTS
effect of ph on solubility of hp-nap in e. coli lysate
to improve the solubility of hp-nap during the cell lysis stage, e. coli expressing recombinant hp-nap was lysed in tris buffer with ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> . as shown in figure  <dig>  overexpressed recombinant hp-nap was detected as a major band with an apparent molecular weight of  <dig> kda by sds-page. at ph  <dig> , little amount of recombinant hp-nap was present in the soluble fraction . the amount of hp-nap detected in the soluble fraction was markedly increased at ph  <dig>  to  <dig>  . at ph  <dig> , hp-nap was mainly present in the soluble fraction . this result indicates that hp-nap is highly soluble in e. coli lysate at ph  <dig> , which is far from the reported pi,  <dig> , of hp-nap  <cit> .figure  <dig>

optimization of the negative purification of hp-nap expressed in e. coli
our previous study has shown that recombinant hp-nap expressed in b. subtilis can be obtained in high purity by negative purification through the collection of the unbound fraction using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin at ph  <dig>  and  <dig>   <cit> . since the upper limit of the ph working range for deae is  <dig> , we here re-investigated whether the same approach can be used to isolate highly pure recombinant hp‐nap expressed in e. coli over a wider ph range of  <dig>  to  <dig> . the soluble fraction containing recombinant hp-nap isolated from e. coli lysate at ph  <dig>  and those adjusted to ph  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig>  were subjected to purification by deae sephadex and deae sepharose anion-exchange resins. at ph  <dig>  to  <dig> , the majority of the recombinant hp-nap remained in the unbound fraction for both resins . at ph  <dig> , only little amount of recombinant hp-nap was detected in the elution fraction . also, the amount of recombinant hp-nap in the elution fraction for deae sepharose resin was higher than that for deae sephadex resin , indicating that deae sepharose resin is capable of binding more recombinant hp-nap than deae sephadex resin. however, at ph  <dig>  and  <dig> , recombinant hp-nap was mainly present in the elution fraction for both resins . at all ph values investigated, recombinant hp-nap was expressed as an oligomeric protein with an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda by native-page analysis . due to the stronger binding ability of deae sepharose resin to the recombinant hp-nap at ph  <dig> , the overall yield of the recombinant hp-nap obtained from the unbound fraction using deae sepharose resin could be less. thus, deae sephadex resin was chosen to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli through the collection of the unbound fraction at ph  <dig> .figure  <dig>

we next determined an optimal loading ratio of the amount of soluble proteins from e. coli lysate loaded onto deae sephadex resin at ph  <dig>  to obtain a maximum yield of highly pure recombinant hp-nap by collecting the unbound fraction. at the ratios of  <dig>  to  <dig>  mg of proteins per milliliter of deae sephadex resins being tested, the purified recombinant hp-nap was present in the unbound and wash fractions . most of the impure proteins from e. coli were present in the elution fractions. the amount of impure proteins in the elution fraction was increased as the ratio of protein to resin increased . even though the amount of recombinant hp-nap was increased in the unbound fraction as the ratio of protein to resin increased , the amount of recombinant hp-nap and impure proteins in the elution fraction was not markedly increased when the ratio of protein to resin reached  <dig>  mg/ml . this result suggests that the binding capacity of deae sephadex resin has reached its maximum level at the ratio of  <dig>  mg of proteins per milliliter resins. thus, the optimized amount of proteins loaded onto deae sephadex resin should be  <dig>  mg of proteins per milliliter resins for purification of recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli.figure  <dig>

purification of hp-nap expressed in e. coli by negative mode batch chromatography using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin
recombinant hp-nap overexpressed in e. coli was subjected to deae sephadex negative mode batch chromatography at ph  <dig>  with the ratio of protein to resin being  <dig>  mg/ml. as shown in figure 4a, the majority of recombinant hp-nap remained in the unbound fraction and some residual recombinant hp-nap was present in the wash fractions. only little amount of recombinant hp-nap was present in the elution fraction as detected by immunoblotting . the unbound fraction and the wash fractions containing recombinant hp-nap were pooled. after the pooled fraction was subjected to dialysis for buffer exchange to dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline , ph  <dig> , and to syringe filtration for endotoxin removal, the purity of recombinant hp‐nap was further increased  and the amount of endotoxin was less than  <dig>  endotoxin unit /mg protein. the purified recombinant hp-nap was an oligomeric protein with an apparent molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda by native-page analysis  and was specifically recognized by the monoclonal antibody against hp-nap by immunoblot analysis . a typical result for purification of hp-nap expressed in e. coli is shown in table  <dig>  the purity of hp-nap was  <dig> % after the step of deae sephadex chromatography, by which a recovery of  <dig> % was achieved. after dialysis and syringe filtration, the final yield was  <dig>  mg hp-nap per gram of cell paste from e. coli culture, and the final purity of hp-nap achieved was  <dig> % with a total recovery of  <dig> %. this result reveals that negative purification of recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin at ph  <dig>  is able to obtain recombinant hp-nap in one step with high purity and high yield.figure  <dig>

structural and functional characterization of purified hp-nap
the structural and molecular properties of the purified recombinant hp-nap were examined by gel filtration, analytical ultracentrifugation, and circular dichroism  spectroscopy to confirm its proper folding. by gel filtration analysis, recombinant hp-nap was eluted as a single peak with the molecular weight of about  <dig> kda , which is consistent with the previous report  <cit>  but is much lower than the molecular weight of ~ <dig> kda as determined by native-page analysis  and the theoretical molecular weight of  <dig> kda of dodecameric hp-nap. the low apparent molecular weight of hp-nap determined by gel filtration may be due to a more compact overall shape of hp-nap as compared with those of the standard proteins used for calibration. the high apparent molecular weight of hp-nap determined by native-page may be resulted from a less negative net charge of hp-nap. by analytical ultracentrifugation analysis, recombinant hp-nap was sedimented as a single peak with a sedimentation coefficient of  <dig>  s . these findings indicate that recombinant hp-nap purified from e. coli is assembled into an oligomeric protein. structure analysis from cd spectroscopy showed that the recombinant hp-nap was mainly composed of α-helices . thus, the purified recombinant hp-nap obtained by negative purification using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin retained its oligomeric status with α-helical structure.figure  <dig>

the ability of recombinant hp-nap purified from e. coli to induce ros production by human neutrophils was examined by 2’,7’-dihydrodichlorofluorescein diacetate -derived fluorescence and luminol-dependent chemiluminescence assays. h2dcfda-derived fluorochrome was used as an indicator of intracellular ros level generated by neutrophils. the production of ros was significantly increased by at least  <dig>  fold in cells stimulated with hp-nap as compared to the control cells . luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was used to measure the generation of both extracellular and intracellular ros by neutrophils upon hp-nap stimulation. the pattern of hp-nap-induced luminol-dependent chemiluminescence is shown in figure 8a. the stimulation of recombinant hp-nap caused a significant burst respiration of neutrophils in comparison with the control as indicated by the increased chemiluminescence signals of both the area under the curve and the peak value . therefore, recombinant hp-nap purified from e. coli is capable of activating human neutrophils to produce ros.figure  <dig>

discussion
in this study, the effect of ph on negative purification of recombinant hp-nap overexpressed in e. coli using deae anion-exchange resins was investigated. at ph  <dig> , most of the recombinant hp-nap bound to deae resins, while at ph ranging from  <dig>  to  <dig> , most of the recombinant hp-nap remained in the unbound fraction. at ph  <dig> , the amount of recombinant hp-nap present in the unbound fraction reached a maximum level. under the optimized condition at ph  <dig> , recombinant hp-nap can be obtained in one step with high purity and high yield by collecting the unbound fraction from batch chromatography using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin. the purified recombinant hp-nap kept its α-helical oligomeric structure and was capable of stimulating neutrophils to produce ros.

recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli purified by anion-exchange chromatography has been reported to be present in the flow-through fraction. deae sepharose resin and q sepharose resin were used to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli by collecting the flow-through fraction at ph  <dig>  and ph  <dig> , respectively  <cit> . thus, the ionizable ligands of the resin and the ph of the buffer may serve as two important parameters to ensure that hp-nap is present in the flow-through rather than binds to the resin. however, both studies show that an extra gel filtration chromatographic step is required to achieve higher purity. our finding that less hp-nap bound to deae sephadex resin than deae sepharose resin indicates that the matrix of the resin also affects the protein binding. in this study, we first optimized the ph of the buffer to allow the maximum amount of hp-nap was present in the unbound fraction. then, an appropriate amount of the soluble proteins from e. coli lysates loaded onto deae sephadex resin at ph  <dig>  was further adjusted to ensure the maximum binding of the impure proteins from e. coli to the resin so that one-step negative purification of highly pure recombinant hp-nap from e. coli could be achieved.

our results show that purification of recombinant hp-nap with more than 95% purity and 90% recovery was achieved at the step of deae sephadex chromatography . the yield of hp-nap from a 50-ml e. coli culture was  <dig>  mg. since the purity of recombinant hp-nap in the e. coli lysate was ~70% , such a high level expression of recombinant hp-nap in e. coli should increase the concentration and purity of hp-nap in the flow-through fraction, resulting in a high recovery and high purity of recombinant hp-nap using the purification method presented here. in our other reports, even though recombinant hp-nap was expressed in the same system, the purity of hp-nap obtained by using the two-step gel-filtration chromatography was 98%  <cit> , and the yield of hp-nap was  <dig>  mg per liter of e. coli culture  <cit> . there is at least a 4-fold increase in the yield of recombinant hp-nap purified from e. coli using this negative chromatography with deae sephadex anion-exchange resin as compared to the two-step gel filtration chromatography. the batch chromatography using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin also reduces the purification time as compared to the gel-filtration chromatography. therefore, deae sephadex negative mode batch chromatography presented in this study is a simple and efficient method to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, a method of negative chromatography using deae sephadex anion-exchange resin in batch mode has been established to purify recombinant hp-nap expressed in e. coli in one step. after optimization of the conditions of cell lysis and purification, highly pure recombinant hp-nap in its native state can be obtained in high yield. hp-nap purified from this approach should be beneficial for the development of vaccines, drugs, or diagnostics against h. pylori.
