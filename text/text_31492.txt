BACKGROUND
phosphorous deficiency is a major constraint to crop production. plants absorb only inorganic form of phosphorous and the level of inorganic phosphorus is very low in the soil because most of the phosphorous is present as insoluble forms. agricultural soils possess considerable accumulation of phosphorous due to the regular excessive applications of chemical fertilizers. the overuse of chemicals and chemical fertilizers has led to the lethal consequences to useful arthropods and other beneficial microbes as well as led to soil pollution. a large proportion of these fertilizers added to the soil are also converted to insoluble form and become unavailable to plants  <cit> .

microorganisms have the ability to solubilize the insoluble phosphates and maintain the soil health and quality  <cit> . bacteria use several direct and indirect mechanisms of action to improve plant growth and health. mechanisms such as phosphate solubilization  <cit> , aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate  deaminase  <cit> , nitrogen cycle  <cit>  and phytohormone production  <cit>  are considered as popular mechanisms. beneficial effects of phosphate solubilizing bacteria to crops have been documented well  <cit> . it is believed that microbial solubilization of phosphate in soil was correlated with the ability of microbes in producing selected organic acids and or extracellular polysaccharides  <cit> . this hypothesis has been corroborated by cloning pyrroloquinoline  synthase  <cit>  and gaby genes involved in gluconic acid production. gluconic acid is the principal organic acid produced due to direct oxidation of glucose by pseudomonas which was found to be involved in phosphate solubilization  <cit> .

among phosphate solubilizing bacteria, fluorescent pseudomonads that colonize aggressively the plant roots have been considered as an important group of bacteria due to their biofertilizing and biocontrol properties. in many occasions, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria often exhibit the production of antimicrobial metabolites, which take part in suppression of diseases caused by soil-borne phytopathogens  <cit>  as well as involve in the induction of systemic resistance against insects and nematodes  <cit> . selective strains of fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria have also been reported for biodegradation of agricultural pollutants  <cit>  as well as for weed control in agricultural fields  <cit> . these bacteria have been considered as an important bioinoculants due to their innate potential to produce plant growth promoting hormones and enzymes  <cit> . though the bacteria belonging to mesorhizobium, rhizobium, klebsiella, acinetobacter, enterobacter, erwinia, achrobacter, micrococcus, aerobacter and bacillus have been reported as phosphate solubilizers, strains belong to pseudomonads are considered as efficient phosphate solubilizers  <cit> .

rice and banana are most important food crops of the world and are widely grown in developing countries. fungal pathogens are important production constraints of rice, banana and other crops. indiscriminate use of fungicides in agriculture is known to be hazardous to the environment and lethal toward other beneficial organisms; it can lead to the development of resistance against target organisms. microbial solubilization of phosphorus, biodegradaton of chemical pollutants and biocontrol of plant pathogens are cost-effective, novel biological restoration and ecofriendly techniques. considering the multiple applications of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads it is essential to study their diversity, which will be useful in designing strategies to use these native strains as bioinoculants for sustainable and organic agriculture without causing harm to the environment and farmers. the objective of the present investigation was to study the genetic and functional diversity of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads associated with rhizospheric soils of rice and banana by an array of in vitro assays, gene amplification techniques, fermentation methods and chromatographic analyses. taxonomic affiliation of bacteria was done on the basis of 16s rrna gene similarity and molecular phylogenetic analyses.

discussion
phosphorus is considered as an essential macronutrient and a great portion of phosphorus from chemical fertilizers becomes insoluble by its conversion into calcium or magnesium salts in soils and become unavailable to plants. soil microorganisms involve to transform the insoluble forms of phosphorus into soluble forms and thus influence the subsequent availability of phosphate to plant roots are considered essential  <cit> . phosphate solubilizing microorganisms have been employed in agriculture and horticulture and have been considered very important due to their potential of ecological amelioration. it is believed that microbial mediated solubilization of insoluble phosphates in soil is through the release of organic acids microbial metabolites  <cit> . however, in addition to acid production, other mechanisms can cause phosphate solubilization  <cit> . phosphate solubilization has been reported to depend on the structural complexicity and particle size of phosphates and the quantity of organic acid secreted by microbes  <cit> .

fluorescent pseudomonads often predominant among plant rhizosphere associated bacteria  <cit> . plant growth promoting rhizobacteria are classified into two different groups such as strains that have the capability of synthesizing phytohormones and strains that have the ability to suppress the growth of phytopathogens  <cit> . fluorescent pseudomonads enhance plant growth by improving soil nutrient status, producing plant growth hormones, enzymes and suppressing the growth of phytopathogenic fungi  <cit> . plant growth promoting rhizobacterial types of fluorescent pseudomonads use one or more mechanisms of direct or indirect in improving plant growth. these mechanisms can probably be active simultaneously or sequentially at different stages of plant growth. this group of bacteria exhibits multiple functional traits such as solubilizing of inorganic phosphate and iron, production of vitamins, phytohormones and antimicrobial metabolites. they are capable of improving plant nutrients uptake, tolerance to stress, salinity, metal toxicity and pesticide. fluorescent pseudomonad strains such as p. fluorescens nj <dig>  <cit> , p. fluorescens em <dig>  <cit> , p. fluorescens  <cit> , pseudomonas spp.  <cit> , p. chlororaphis, p. savastanoi, p. pickettii  <cit>  and p. corrugata  <cit>  have been reported as phosphate solubilizers.

in the present investigation, out of  <dig> fluorescent pseudomonad strains screened,  <dig> strains have been identified as phosphate solubilizers. these strains were taxonomically described as different fluorescent pseudomonad species such as p. monteilli, p. putida, p. plecoglossicida, p. fluoresens, p. fulva, p. monteilli and p. aeruginosa on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequencing and subsequent molecular phylogeny analysis. phenotypic analyses as well as 16s rrna and box-pcr based genotypic analyses revealed a high degree of diversity among phosphate solubilizing bacteria reported in this study. significant decline in the ph of the culture medium by strains was observed during mineral phosphate solubilization, which suggested the microbial production of organic acids  <cit> . although phosphate solubilization is not necessarily correlated with acidity, from the data present in this study relationship could be ascertained between the acidity of medium and the release of soluble phosphates. estimation of phosphate solubilization of strains by other methods has been reported to be between  <dig> to  <dig> μg ml- <dig>  <cit> . in an earlier study, p. fluorescens strain nj- <dig> isolated from agricultural soil was reported to release  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> soluble phosphate from inorganic phosphate  <cit>  and in the present study, up to  <dig>  μg ml- <dig> soluble phosphate was estimated. we have found that 49% of the strains produced iaa and 16% of the strains produced acc deaminase. it is reported that the acc deaminase producing bacteria increase root elongation and seed germination by lowering plant ethylene levels  <cit> . specific strains of fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria indirectly influence the plant health by preventing the deleterious effects of phytopathogenic microorganisms through the production of antibiotics, cell wall degrading enzymes, hcn metabolite and siderophores  <cit> . production of hcn by p. fluorescens chao was recognized as a biocontrol factor, against plant pathogenic fungi  <cit> .

production of antibiotics by fluorescent pseudomonads considered important in suppression of phytopathogens. recently, p. aeruginosa pupa <dig>  a new strain from rice rhizosphere with potential for fungal antibiosis and biofertilizing traits has been identified from our laboratory  <cit> . all the strains reported in this study produced hydroxamate siderophores as evidenced on fecl <dig> amended cas agar medium, production of an array of phytohormones and antifungal metabolites. microbial production of antibiotics, pca , dapg , plt  and prn  by biofertilizing and biocontrol strains have been reported in earlier studies  <cit> . in the present study the production of pca , dapg , plt  and prn  by phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonads has been reported. strain efficiency and variations in the fermentation conditions often result in an alteration in antibiotic production. considering the quantity of antibiotics by plant growth promoting and biocontrol strains of fluorescent pseduomonads reported by other inverstigators  <cit> , strains reported in this study may be considered as non-pathogenic to plants and antagonistic bacteria against phytopathogenic fungi. strains reported in this study utilized several carbon sources as identified by hi-carbohydrate™ kit test. utilization of variety of carbon sources by the strains may play an important role in adapting to a variety of crop plants and soil types.

the iaa hormone is known to have dual role in influencing plant growth, by involving in the biocontrol together with glutathione-s-transferases in defense-related plant reactions and inhibits the germination of spore and growth of mycelium of different pathogenic fungi  <cit> . martinez noel et al.  showed that the iaa supply to excised potato leaves reduced the severity of the disease provoked by phytophthora infestans  <cit> . in present investigation, we have identified the spectrum of bacterial antagonism by measuring the inhibition zones of mycelial radial growth in plate assays. these antagonistic strains also showed production of iaa, fungal cell wall degrading enzymes, such as cellulases, proteases and chitinases which are known to be involved in antagonistic activity against phytopathogenic fungi and insects  <cit> . selective microbial producers of chitinase are also reported to be the efficient phosphate solubilizers  <cit> . phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad strains reported in this study may solubilize insoluble compounds due to the excretion of organic acids. production of antimicrobial metabolites and organic acids is essential to decrease soil ph, which plays a major role in solubilization of phosphates and other nutrients.

characterization of phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad bacteria is required to study their ecological role in soil. fluorescent pseudomonad strains reported in this study with phosphate solubilization potential and ability to excrete phytohormones and antimicrobial metabolites may be used as plant growth promoting bacteria and biocontrol agents in sustainable agriculture.

CONCLUSIONS
phosphate solubilizing fluorescent pseudomonad bacterial strains with their multifunctional properties will attract more attention in the field of biofertilization and biological control. present investigation revealed the microbial diversity of fluorescent pseudomonads with innate potential of mineralizing phosphate, plant growth promoting traits and biocontrol properties. knowledge generated on biodiversity of phosphate solubilizing bacteria will be useful to design strategies to use these strains as inoculants in sustainable and organic agriculture.
