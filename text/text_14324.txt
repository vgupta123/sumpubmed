BACKGROUND
experimental identification of dna sequence motifs that bind specific transcription factors  and regulate gene expression are expensive, time-consuming, and difficult. this makes bioinformatic methods for identifying cis-elements an important tool for prioritizing future experimental studies of transcriptional regulation. rod and cone photoreceptors each specialize in a unique function by the expression of distinct genes that perform analogous roles in each cell's light transduction pathway. bioinformatic motif identification techniques have been used to successfully identify potential targets of  <dig> photoreceptor-specific transcription factors  using their known binding specificity  <cit> . experimental evidence suggests that at least  <dig> additional transcription factors are involved in regulation of either rod- or cone-specific expression  <cit> . however, binding motifs for many of these transcription factors are presently unknown. in this study, we use de novo motif discovery methods to identify motifs that may be important for gene expression differences between rod and cone photoreceptors.

the most commonly used de novo method is phylogenetic footprinting, based on the assumption that functional sequence changes more slowly through evolution compared to the surrounding sequence. the advantage of phylogenetic footprinting is its specificity: significant conservation across many species strongly suggests that a sequence is functional. however, phylogenetic footprinting suffers from a high incidence of false negative errors  <cit> . alternative approaches seek to identify motifs that are over-represented compared to a set of unrelated background sequences  <cit> . to increase the accuracy of predictions, recent over-representation motif discovery implementations incorporate additional biological information  <cit> , such as the position of motifs relative to the transcription start site . here, we use a combination of over-representation, position-based filtering, and phylogenetic analysis to select and analyze motifs that may be involved in rod and cone-specific expression patterns.

our motif discovery implementation, called iterative alignment/modular motif selection , selects motifs based on three biological assumptions. first, we assume that promoters of functionally linked genes will share similar regulatory motifs. the second assumption is that functional motifs are concentrated near the transcription start site  <cit> . third, we assume that occurrences of a given motif cluster near a characteristic distance from the transcription start site  <cit> . to implement the last two assumptions, we applied a hierarchical clustering algorithm because the algorithm chooses the mode and variance of a distribution based on the underlying data. this approach advances position-based filtering over previous implementations that model motif position dependence by a static distribution given by the empirical frequency of all motifs relative to the transcription start site in bacteria  <cit> . we implement this approach on a set of murine rod-specific, cone-specific, and background promoter sequences derived from biochemical  <cit>  and microarray  <cit>  studies.

iamms identified  <dig> motifs enriched in the promoter of either rod or cone photoreceptors, most of which are not similar to any previously known motifs. to increase our confidence in these predictions, results obtained using iamms were compared to those of existing motif discovery algorithms, dme and bioprospector. we chose bioprospector because it improves on the well-studied gibbs sampling algorithm by representing background sequences as a third-order markov model  <cit> . dme was chosen because it is based on the well-regarded maximum likelihood algorithm  <cit> . this comparison revealed that over 60% of our predictions were also confirmed by at least one additional algorithm. we provide extensive discussion of these predictions in the context of the biochemical literature.

RESULTS
application of iamms to rod and cone-specific promoters
input to iamms consisted of the upstream region of  <dig> rod-specific,  <dig> cone-specific, and  <dig> non-photoreceptor genes . the flowchart of the iamms algorithm is shown in figure  <dig> . the first step involved an iterative alignment procedure conducted on all rod, cone, and non-photoreceptor promoters. this step resulted in a dataset of  <dig>  conserved motifs between  <dig> and  <dig> bp in length. each entry of the dataset contains nucleotide sequences, the location of motif occurrences with respect to the transcription start site, strand, and promoter from which each occurrence originated. to illustrate the composition of the dataset, we plotted motif length against the number of occurrences of each motif in photoreceptor promoters . the color map represents the number of motifs with each length/frequency combination. as may be expected, motif size has an inverse relationship with the number of occurrences.

rod-specific and cone-specific genes whose promoters were used in this study are listed by mgi symbol. references to the article stating cell-specificity are given superscript to each gene.

analysis showed that the majority of motifs identified after the first step were repeat sequences. the motifs occurring most frequently  were primarily simple repeats. all longer motifs  were highly similar to microsatellites and interspersed repeats, as revealed by comparison to a database of known repeats . repeat sequences were filtered out at step  <dig> 

after repeat filtering, the remaining motifs, those inside and immediately above the marked box in figure  <dig>  were evaluated for potential enrichment in rod or cone photoreceptors . since we are interested in motifs that occur in the promoters of only one photoreceptor cell type, motifs that have occurrences in both rod and cone promoters were classified as ambiguous and were excluded from consideration during this step. to evaluate enrichment of a motif compared to background, we assume a binomial distribution of kr rod specific  promoters drawn from the total number of promoters that contain occurrences. a bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis testing  is applied to the resulting p-value, as described in the statistical annotation section of methods. the top scoring motifs identified during this step were subjected to phylogenetic analysis  and compared to known motifs using the transcriptional element search system .

the rod-enriched motif  is  <dig> bp in length and contains  <dig> occurrences in rod promoters. cross-species conservation shows that pde6a, gnb <dig>  and nr2e <dig> occurrences are phylogenetically conserved . according to tess, this motif is similar to a c-myb binding site. the prediction that c-myb may have a function unique to one type of photoreceptor is consistent with publicly available microarray data . we found that c-myb is between  <dig>  and  <dig>  fold enriched in cones compared to rod photoreceptors.

after step  <dig>  iamms identified a total of  <dig> motifs  with e <  <dig> . since no position filtering was applied to identify these motifs, we refer to them as position independent. all position independent rod- and cone-enriched motifs, sorted based on e-value, are shown on the top of figure  <dig>  the highest scoring rod prediction at the top of figure  <dig> contains two  <dig> bp invariant core regions separated by two ambiguous positions . the position variance of this prediction is remarkably small  considering that no position-based selection was applied to identify this sequence. the top scoring cone motif contains a core region  <dig> bp in width . it occurs in 8/ <dig> cone promoter sequences with no discernable bias in position. detailed information on the position and phylogenetic conservation of each occurrence is available as additional data  online.

those motifs classified as ambiguous during step  <dig> were subjected to position-based clustering . as described previously, we acted under the hypothesis that occurrences of a motif near the transcription start site, and those occurring in clusters around a preferred position, are more likely to be functional. one example of clusters selected by the hierarchical clustering algorithm is shown in figure 5a. this particular motif contains  <dig> occurrences, plotted as triangles based on their 1-dimensional position relative to the transcription start site. these occurrences are broken into clusters by the algorithm, denoted by blue ovals. a cone-enriched cluster just upstream of the transcription start site is shown in pink. this cluster contains 5/ <dig> occurrences from cone-specific promoters, and only 4/ <dig> occurrences in non-photoreceptor promoter regions.

after motifs were broken into position-dependant clusters, we used the same statistical procedure described above to select those clusters enriched in rod or cone promoters . figure 5b–c plots the ratio between cell-specific and total occurrences  against the total number of promoters with at least one occurrence . points are colored based on the number of motifs with a given combination, in a similar manner to figure  <dig>  the cone-enriched cluster cagaag shown in figure 5a is one of the motifs represented by the point marked in figure 5c. this point lies just inside the gray region representing a statistical threshold of p =  <dig>  that was used to classify motifs as enriched in rod  specific promoter sequences. a motif corresponding to the known cone-specific cis-element rop <dig> is also represented by a point in the gray region of figure 5c. figure 5b shows the same representation as figure 5c for rod-specific motifs. a previously characterized rod-specific motif, nre, is represented by a point that lies just inside the gray region , indicating the biological relevance of motifs represented in this region.

a detailed view of the nre-like motif identified after step  <dig> is shown in the left panel of figure  <dig>  the predicted motif contains a core region . the occurrence in the rho promoter at - <dig> bp  has already been validated experimentally  <cit> . two sample cross-species phylogenetic alignments are shown below the functional alignment in figure  <dig> . in this case, these occurrences are very highly conserved relative to the surrounding sequence.

another known transcription factor binding site detected in this study corresponds to the recently discovered cone-specific sequence rop <dig>  shown in the right panel of figure  <dig>  this prediction contains an occurrence in the opn1mw promoter that was recently discovered to be required for cone-specific expression  <cit> . previously unknown occurrences of rop <dig> were predicted in the promoter of opn1sw,smug <dig>  and cnga <dig>  the newly-discovered occurrence in the opn1sw promoter shows remarkable position-conservation relative to the transcription start site when compared with the known opn1mw occurrence: - <dig> and - <dig> bp, respectively, a difference of only  <dig> bp. selected phylogenetic alignments  show that the occurrences in the cnga <dig> and opn1mw promoters are highly conserved through evolution. in addition to increasing confidence in predictions, the rop <dig> detection also provides exciting new targets for a cis-element that is pertinent for cone-specificity.

the  <dig> highest scoring  rod- and cone-enriched position dependent predictions are shown on the bottom of figure  <dig>  the example given in figure 5a  can be found among cone-enriched motifs in row  <dig>  among the high scoring motifs,  <dig> rod and  <dig> cone predictions are similar to known motifs whose specific binding positions  are not known, including four putative initiator  elements, nre, an il- <dig> effector, an rxr binding site, rop <dig>  a putative tata-like motif, and an engrailed homeodomain binding site. phylgoenetic conservation is relatively high for several of the elements, including two conservation scores less than - <dig> for cone-enriched predictions . as we show in the next section, many of these motifs are corroborated by motifs predicted by dme and/or bioprospector.

comparison with dme and bioprospector
to increase confidence in our predictions, we compared motifs discovered using iamms to those discovered using existing de novo motif discovery algorithms, dme and bioprospector. for both of these algorithms, a smaller section of the upstream region was employed  for a more similar comparison to iamms position clustering implementation. in order to return useful results, promoter regions needed to be repeat masked prior to analysis. since the rod- and cone-specific sets are too small to be compared directly against each other, cone promoters were compared against the combined set of background and rod promoters to evaluate cone-enrichment. the same approach was used to identify rod-enriched predictions.

the top  <dig> motifs for each motif length between  <dig> and  <dig> bp  or  <dig> and  <dig> bp  were compared with the top iamms predictions. this comparison is shown in figure  <dig>  predictions made by iamms and confirmed by dme or bioprospector are highlighted in yellow , blue , or orange . it is interesting to note that rod predictions for dme and bioprospector were in agreement with iamms a much higher proportion of the time  compared to cone predictions . this difference between the numbers results from a much lower rate of agreement between iamms and bioprospector in cone sequences. compared to bioprospector, the rate of agreement between iamms and dme in rods and cones is similar . we conclude that although they use different underlying algorithms, results obtained using dme are more similar to iamms compared with bioprospector.

overall, of  <dig> rod- and cone-specific predictions,  <dig>  are confirmed by either dme or bioprospector and  <dig>  were confirmed by both. major predictions, including the rop <dig> binding site, initiator, tata-like, and il- <dig>  were corroborated by at least one motif discovery algorithm. the initiator-like and tata-like predictions were identified by all  <dig> algorithms, increasing our confidence in these predictions.

discussion
in this article, we use a combination of motif discovery algorithms to identify putative cis-elements that may be responsible for differences in gene expression between rod and cone photoreceptors. we identified  <dig> conserved motifs highly enriched in either rod or cone photoreceptor genes. our predictions can be divided into three distinct groups:

 <dig>  completely new motifs that bare no resemblance to known transcription factor binding sites. this first group contains  <dig> motifs, most of which are confirmed by at least two discovery algorithms, or have a high degree of phylogenetic conservation.

 <dig>  motifs similar to cis-elements with known photoreceptor function. this second group contains  <dig> motifs, including motifs that have been characterized by previous experimental studies  as well as motifs whose putative binding sites are unknown . it is notable that all these motifs were derived without using any specific a priori knowledge.

 <dig>  motifs similar to known cis-elements whose involvement in photoreceptor function has not yet been established. this final group includes the tata-like and initiator-like sequences enriched in cone and rod promoters, respectively .

rxr and en <dig> binding motifs in promoters of cone-specific genes
previous microarray studies suggest that at least  <dig> transcription factors  are more active in cone photoreceptors than rods  <cit> . the role of rxr is supported by additional biochemical studies which demonstrate that rxrγ plays a vital role in patterning cone photoreceptors in response to signaling by thyroid hormone receptor β <dig>  <cit> . the rxr prediction is shown in figure  <dig>  position independent, row  <dig>  functional rxr cis-elements often contain a degenerate repeat of the invariant core in close proximity  <cit> . therefore, we examined the promoter sequences surrounding predicted rxr sites for degenerate variations of the putative core selected by iamms. out of  <dig> sites,  <dig> contain an additional occurrence of gtca within  <dig> bp of the recognized site . this is very unlikely to occur by chance , further increasing our confidence that the predicted motif binds rxr-family transcription factors.

the en2-like motif is shown in figure  <dig> cone-enriched position dependent row  <dig>  the prediction includes the central portion of the optimal en <dig> homeodomain transcription factor consensus  detected by in vitro selection experiments  <cit> . while a corresponding motif was detected only by iamms , occurrences of the engrailed-like prediction are highly conserved through evolution  suggesting that the motif is functional. a similar prediction  contains many of the same occurrences, but shifts the core by ~ <dig> bp and adds an additional a to the 3' end. like the first prediction, it is also highly conserved through evolution, centered in the same region, and cone-specific. moreover, this second prediction was also detected by dme . if validated experimentally, occurrences of this aatt motif will be the first reported promoter binding sites for en <dig> 

we were unable to find binding sites for sall <dig> or prdm <dig> in the experimental literature. some of the unidentified motifs predicted in this study  may correspond to binding sties for these transcription factors. future experimental studies will be required to discover any correspondence between these transcription factors and motifs predicted in this study.

il- <dig> binding motif in promoters of rod-specific genes
one of the rod-specific predictions, detected by both iamms and bioprospector, is similar to an il- <dig> effector . this is interesting in the context of recent findings that in rodents, signaling by il- <dig> family members cntf and lif can block the formation of rod photoeceptors during development  <cit> . according to the literature, peak il- <dig> effector activity is obtained by the invariant core  and another degenerate occurrence  appearing nearby  <cit> . our prediction corresponds to the first invariant core . to determine if a degenerate occurrence appeared nearby, we took rod-enriched il-6-like predictions andsearched nearby promoter sequence to find if any elements similar to the core were present. we found that  <dig> rod-specific promoter sequences, including pde6b, gnat <dig>  pde6d, and rho contain an exact copy of either the degenerate sequence or the high-affinity core binding sequence within  <dig> bp of a predicted occurrence . it is interesting that in chick, where artificial il- <dig> stimulation increases the number of rod photoreceptors  <cit> , only one orthologous promoter  contains both the invariant core and a degenerate consensus within  <dig> bp of one another. the correspondence between empirical evidence and occurrences of il-6-like motifs lends support for the biological relevance of the il- <dig> prediction.

the high-affinity core and a degenerate occurrence missing only the final a  was found in the nrl promoter. this predicted site is likely to be significant considering the important role nrl plays in rod photoreceptor differentiation  <cit> . this observation suggests that one possible mechanism for il- <dig> regulation of rod-differentiation involves suppression of the nrl gene product.

differences in the core promoter of rod and cone-specific genes
one of the most striking findings of this study is differences in the core promoter region of rod-and cone-specific genes. we predicted several rod-enriched motifs centered on the transcription start site that are similar to characterized initiator consensus sequences, but no enrichment of degenerate initiator-like sequences were found specific to cones. conversely, a tata-like motif was detected in almost all cone promoters near the appropriate position upstream of the transcription start site, whereas it was absent from rod promoters.

in cone promoters we found a different core promoter element, ataa, a motif similar to the central portion of a tata box . one such prediction is depicted in the right panel of figure  <dig>  occurrences of this particular motif are found in  <dig> cone promoters, arr <dig> gnat <dig> gnb <dig>  and pde6c . these occurrences are located between  <dig> and  <dig> bp upstream of the transcription start site, close to the typical position of a tata-box  <cit> , supporting the idea that it is, indeed, a degenerate variation on the tata consensus. a high degree of phylogenetic conservation of this motif and corroboration by both dme and bioprospector further support the biological relevance of this prediction.

many of the ataa occurrences contain an additional t on the beginning of the motif, making them even closer to the classic tata-consensus. we conducted a search for tata-like sequences in the core promoter of rod and cone genes. it is interesting that the sequence tataa  appears in  <dig> cone promoters  between - <dig> to + <dig> relative to the transcription start site. conversely, this sequence is only found in two  out of  <dig> rod promoters. the enrichment of the tataa sequence in cones, although not as pronounced as ataa, lends further support to the idea that the cone promoters studied here are initiated by a tata box. it is notable that except for elovl <dig> and pde6h, an occurrence of either sataagw or tataa is present near the transcription start site in all cone-specific promoters.

experimental evidence supports the biological relevance of the ataa prediction, regardless of whether it is, indeed, a degenerate tata-box. a recent experimental study deleted two occurrences of tata-like motifs from the arr <dig> promoter  <cit>  and observed that the previously cone-specific promoter drove transgene expression in rods as well. in light of our predictions, we suggest that a tata or tata-like motif in the core promoter plays a central role in the differences between rod and cone expression patterns.

limitations
the fact that the number of genes specifically expressed in either rod or cone photoreceptors is rather small makes the application of de novo motif discovery approaches that heavily rely on statistical analysis difficult. because of this consideration, we took two independent approaches designed to increase the accuracy of our results. first, we employed a large number of non-photoreceptor genes as a negative control, and evaluated enrichment of motifs in either rod or cone promoters relative to this large dataset. second, we applied  <dig> motif discovery software packages that use different algorithms to identify motifs. while we do not filter motifs that are identified by only one algorithm from our final database, we do provide a table of overlaps  as additional information that can be used to evaluate predictions. together, these two approaches should minimize both false positive and false negative errors.

in the present study, we selected promoters based on ensembl annotated transcription start sites. however, recent reports suggest that two separate ambiguities exist in transcription start site annotations. one, the so-called "borad" class of transcription start sites, represents inherent local variation over 50– <dig> bp  <cit> . this complication should not have a major impact on the quality of our predictions. since hierarchical clustering automatically chooses the mode and variance of a motifs' position distribution relative to the transcription start site separately for each motif, iamms should turn up the same predictions with some additional position variance.

a second ambiguity is the recent observation that a majority of genes are driven by two or more alternative promoter sequences  <cit> . to determine the relevance of this finding for our study, we searched the database of transcription start sites  for genes used in this study, and found only  <dig> genes  that contain potential alternate transcription start sites far from the ensembl annotation, and  <dig> additional genes  that contain alternate transcription start sites within  <dig> bp  <cit> . however, in all of these cases the alternate transcripts were identified in non-retinal tissue, and therefore the alternate start sites do not pertain to our present application. in addition, 8/ <dig> promoters that we selected for analysis are validated experimentally . those considerations expressed above give us confidence in the promoter regions selected for this study.

this study did not detect motifs corresponding to two transcription factors known to be enriched in rod-photoreceptors compared to cones, including mef2c  <cit>  and nr2e <dig>  <cit> . one of the causes of this omission could potentially be the multiple severe constraints in our selection criteria that were introduced to maximally reduce the rate of false positive predictions. in the case of nr2e <dig>  another potential reason may be that nr2e <dig> may not bind dna directly in vivo. rather, recent findings suggest that nr2e <dig> regulates expression indirectly by interactions with crx  <cit> . if there is no nr2e <dig> binding directly to dna, it is not surprising that we do not identify a motif for this transcription factor.

CONCLUSIONS
using a panel of three motif discovery algorithms , we predict  <dig> putative cis-elements that may be vital for maintaining either rod or cone gene expression patterns. our predictions include many previously unknown motifs, known cis-elements involved in maintaining the differences between rod and cone expression patterns, as well as binding sites for transcription factors with no known photoreceptor function. our most important predictions include specific sites for rxr and engrailed family members  and il- <dig> effectors . we predict differences in the core promoter between rod and cone phototransduction genes. while rod promoters are enriched in putative initiator-like motifs and are tata-less, cone promoters are enriched in tata-like motifs. to simplify access to our findings, we provide an on-line database containing detailed information about the exact position of the motifs with the respect to the transcription start and their phylogenetic conservation .
