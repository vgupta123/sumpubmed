BACKGROUND
the sea urchin is a model animal for cell and developmental biology and genomics. as a basal deuterostome, it provides an out-group for the chordates, and thus insights into vertebrate genome evolution. the genome of the purple sea urchin, strongylocentrotus purpuratus , is one-quarter the size of the human genome and encodes ~ <dig>  genes  <cit> , the majority having vertebrate orthologs. sea urchin genes are closer to human and mouse than to other invertebrate models such as drosophila and c. elegans. for example, the number of reciprocal pairs of genes between sea urchin and mouse is about 50% greater than between sea urchin and drosophila  <cit> . the sea urchin lacks four of the human kinase subfamilies, while drosophila lacks  <dig> and nematodes  <dig>  <cit> . regarding gene conservation,  <dig> of the  <dig> known animal wnt genes are present in the sea urchin  <cit> . the sea urchin has ~ <dig> demonstrated human disease gene orthologs . the functions of sea urchin disease gene orthologs are thus important to human medicine.

in our study of sea urchin sperm receptor proteins that bind egg jelly to trigger the exocytotic acrosome reaction  <cit> , we have described four sperm plasma membrane proteins, named sp receptor for egg jelly 1– <dig>   <cit> . the first of these proteins, sprej <dig>  is a heavily glycosylated,  <dig> kda receptor that binds the fucose sulfate polymer of egg jelly to trigger the sperm acrosome reaction  <cit> . monoclonal antibodies to sprej <dig> induce the acrosome reaction and compete with the fucose sulfate polymer  <cit> . sprej <dig> localizes to the plasma membrane covering the acrosomal vesicle and to the flagellar membrane  <cit> . the paralog, sprej <dig>  localizes to the entire sperm plasma membrane, but is concentrated over the mitochondrion. it is thought to be intracellular because it does not label when intact cells are radioiodinated and it is not glycosylated  <cit> . in sperm, sprej <dig>  is only found in the plasma membrane over the sperm acrosomal vesicle  <cit> . sprej <dig> is structurally similar to sprej <dig>  but is only found in the sperm flagellar membrane  <cit> . homology searches with the four sprej proteins showed that they all contain a large domain, named the "receptor for egg jelly" domain  that occurs in only one gene family, the polycystic kidney disease- <dig>  family, found in both protostomes  <cit>  and vertebrates  <cit> . the pfam database  defines the rej domain as ~ <dig> amino acids having six conserved cys residues. although sprej proteins are pkd <dig> family members, we prefer to use the sprej designation to be consistent with past publications  <cit> .

in humans, the hpkd <dig> gene is expressed in many tissues in addition to kidneys and encodes a glycoprotein of  <dig>  amino acids, also called hpkd <dig>  or polycystin- <dig> , much of which is extracellular and has the characteristics of a lectin-like, signal transduction molecule  <cit> . mutations in hpkd <dig> cause ~85% of the cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease , probably the most common human monogenic disease with an incidence of > 1: <dig>  which is characterized by progressive development and enlargement of cysts, resulting in end-stage renal failure  <cit> . the other ~15% of adpkd cases arise from mutations in hpkd <dig>  or polycystin- <dig> , a member of the trp family that forms a cation channel when exogenously expressed  <cit> . hpkd <dig> and hpkd <dig> proteins are associated through coiled-coil domains in their carboxyl termini, and it is thought that hpkd <dig> regulates the activity of the hpkd <dig> cation channel  <cit>  and also chloride transporters  <cit> . recent evidence indicates that mammalian pkd <dig> is a mechanoreceptor, associated with the primary cilium of kidney tubule epithelial cells. the primary cilium senses fluid flow in the tubule and that in turn is thought to regulate the activity of the hpkd <dig> channel  <cit> .

in addition to hpkd <dig>  there are four other human orthologs: hpkdrej, hpkd1l <dig>  hpkd1l <dig> and hpkd1l <dig>  hpkd <dig> protein is found in most human tissues. the intronless hpkdrej is only expressed in mammalian testis  <cit>  and associates with several trp channel proteins and modulates g-protein signaling  <cit> . mammalian pkdrej, like sea urchin sprej <dig>  is found only in the plasma membrane covering the sperm acrosomal vesicle  <cit> . like hpkdrej, sprej <dig> also associates with a sea urchin sperm trp channel, sppkd <dig>  <cit> . hpkd1-like- <dig>  has high expression levels in testis leydig cells and heart  <cit> . hpkd1l <dig> is found in a long and short form, the short form beginning in exon  <dig> of the long form. the short form is expressed in heart and kidney and the long form in brain and testis  <cit> . hpkd1l <dig> associates with the trp protein hpkd2l <dig>  to form a cation channel in taste buds for the sensation of sour  <cit> . hpkd1l <dig> does not contain a rej domain, but it is included in the pkd <dig> family because of other pkd <dig> homologous domains. hpkdrej, and the three hpkd1l proteins all contain a cation channel domain made up by tm segments 6– <dig> 

searching the sea urchin genome  <cit>  for homologs containing a rej domain, yielded six novel sprej genes in addition to the four already known sprej cdna sequences. the sequences of the six novel sprej cdnas were determined and their secondary structures predicted. here we compare all  <dig> sprej predicted proteins to the five human hpkd <dig> family proteins. data are also presented on the levels of expression of the  <dig> sprej genes during embryogenesis and also in six adult sea urchin tissues.

RESULTS
cloning sprej cdnas
searching the sea urchin genome database with the four known sprej sequences identified the six unknown orthologs with rej domains. all start and stop codons and all full-length cdna sequences were obtained experimentally. all  <dig> genes were completely annotated and their major features determined . genome analysis shows that all  <dig> sprej genes are single copy.

sprej protein features compared to human pkd <dig> orthologs
protein architectures based on secondary structure predictions of the  <dig> sprej proteins and the five human pkd <dig> proteins are shown in figure  <dig>  sprej <dig> is the only one in which a transmembrane segment  is not predicted. sprejs  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are predicted to have one tm, sprej <dig> two tm, sprej <dig> six tm, and sprej3- <dig>  and all five human pkd <dig> proteins,  <dig> tm segments. the last six tm of sprej3- <dig>  like the hpkd1l proteins, share homology with cation channels  <cit> .

the rej domain is found in four of the human pkd <dig> proteins. the fifth human pkd <dig> ortholog  does not possess a rej domain, however it is classified as a pkd <dig> protein because of having  <dig> putative tm, a gps domain and a plat domain  <cit> . sprej <dig> and  <dig>  and human hpkd1l <dig>  all have partial rej domains. sprej <dig> has a split rej domain of  <dig> and  <dig> residues, with  <dig> non-rej residues between the two rej sections. all the other sprej proteins and hpkd <dig>  hpkdrej, hpkd1l <dig> have complete rej domains with all six conserved cys residues.

with the exception of sprej <dig>  all these predicted sea urchin and human pkd <dig> family proteins contain a g-protein-coupled receptor cleavage site  upstream of the first tm. the gps is where the protein chain is known to be cleaved in sprej <dig>  <cit>  and human hpkd <dig>  <cit> , yet both halves of the protein remain associated on the cell surface. it is assumed that all pkd <dig> family members are most likely cleaved at the gps domain. the five human proteins and five of the predicted sea urchin proteins have a plat/lh <dig> domain  immediately following the first tm  <cit> . the plat domain is always found intracellularly and supports the topology shown in figure  <dig> 

sprej <dig> is the only sea urchin protein that experimental data suggests is mainly intracellular because it is not labeled by vectoral radioiodination of the sperm surface and it does not appear to be glycosylated  <cit> . sprej <dig> becomes heavily labeled by vectoral iodination and it is 50% carbohydrate  <cit> . sprej <dig> and  <dig> are the only sprej proteins predicted to have both n- and c-termini on the same side of a membrane. although only sprej <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> are predicted to have c-terminal coiled coils, all five human proteins show this motif that is involved in protein-protein interaction.

carbohydrate recognition domains of ~ <dig> amino acids  are found in sprej <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and hpkd <dig> and hpkd1l <dig>  there is one egf domain in sprej <dig>  <cit> , and one sea urchin egg lectin domain  in sprej <dig>  <cit>  and hpkd1l <dig>  "pkd" repeats  are found in sprej2- <dig> and  <dig> and hpkd <dig>  hpkd1l <dig> and hpkd1l <dig>  sprej <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> and human hpkd <dig> contain a wsc domain, which was originally identified in yeast cell wall integrity and stress response proteins  <cit> . in sprej <dig>  there is a serine-rich region close to the n-terminus from ser <dig> to ser <dig> and ser <dig> to ser <dig> composed of 76% ser residues. hydropathy analysis shows that a signal sequence is present in all five human proteins and all sprejs except sprej <dig>  multiple attempts to experimentally obtain a signal sequence for sprej <dig> failed. furthermore, one could not be found in the predicted gene model.

construction of phylogenetic trees using full-length sequences of the  <dig> sea urchin and five human proteins yielded branch nodes with low statistical support. the same negative results were obtained when only the rej domains were used to construct trees. the only consistent trend was that sprej  <dig> and  <dig> branched close to hpkdrej.

gene structure
the intron and exon numbers and scaffold positions of the  <dig> sprej genes were determined . sprej <dig> is in three segments in two scaffolds, while sprej <dig> is in five scaffolds, thus with the current assembly it is difficult to compare these two genes. the rej domains of these two proteins are 82% identical. similarity in the downstream portions of sprej <dig> and  <dig> is clearly evident, as it is in the upstream portions of sprej <dig> compared to  <dig>  and sprej <dig> compared to  <dig>  table  <dig> gives the number of exons per gene, total residues and predicted molecular masses of these proteins. the genomic sequence of sprej <dig> has  <dig> exons, which makes it the largest of the sprejs. the low similarity of intron/exon numbers and lengths suggests that the duplication and subsequence differentiation of these genes is ancient.

expression of sprej genes in developing embryos
the expression of the  <dig> sprejs at different embryonic stages was investigated using real-time quantitative pcr . previous work on s. purpuratus showed that the ubiquitin transcript  levels are constant during early development, so that other transcripts can be normalized to ubiquitin . under our experimental conditions, the expression of sprej <dig> and  <dig> were not detectable in early embryos. sprej <dig> is most abundant in eggs and decreases ~6-fold by  <dig> hours and then remains constant to  <dig> hours. sprej <dig> is also highest in eggs, but decreases about 60% to constant levels by  <dig> hours. sprej <dig> expression remains fairly constant from  <dig> to  <dig> hours. sprej <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> show substantial increases in transcript number during development. sprej <dig> is the only one that increases sharply from  <dig> to  <dig> hours and then decreases sharply from  <dig> to  <dig> hours. of all ten sprej transcripts, the greatest abundances are seen for sprej <dig> at  <dig> hours and sprej <dig> at  <dig> hours.

expression of sprej genes in adult sea urchin tissues
rt-q-pcr was used to determine the expression of sprej genes in six adult tissues . testis, ovary, muscle/test , gut, lantern  and coelomocytes  were the six tissues that can be visibly separated from each other for rna extraction. the range of ubiquitin transcript number is not known for adult tissues. our data show that ubiquitin transcripts range from approximately  <dig>  million per  <dig> ng total rna in ovary, to  <dig>  million per  <dig> ng rna in coelomocytes. this might be expected because coelomocytes are highly phagocytic cells. ubiquitin transcript levels are fairly similar in testis, gut, lantern and ovary. with the caveat regarding ubiquitin transcript levels stated, we did normalize the sprej transcript levels to ubiquitin. relative to the other sprej transcripts, sprej <dig> is highly expressed only in testis  <cit>  and the same is true for sprej <dig> expression in muscle/test. sprej <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> have relatively low expression in adult ovary. sprej <dig>   <dig> ,  <dig> and  <dig> show low expression in coelomocytes. sprej <dig> is the only sprej that is weakly expressed in testis. to generalize, with the exception of sprej <dig> in testis and sprej <dig> in muscle/test, most sprej genes are expressed in easily measurable levels in these adult tissues. each adult tissue shows a tissue-specific pattern of expression of the  <dig> sprej transcripts.

discussion
whole genome sequences of model organisms permit the discovery of gene families involved in human disease. the sea urchin genome contains ~ <dig> human disease gene orthologs . the functions of many of these orthologs remain unknown. genome analysis of lower deuterostomes identifies disease gene orthologs for future functional studies. in this report we describe the sea urchin sprej gene family that are members of the larger pkd <dig> gene family, whose mutations in humans are associated with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease. sprej proteins are a subset of the pkd <dig> family because of possession of rej, gps and plat/lh <dig> domains. our interest in the sprej proteins came from the observation that monoclonal antibodies to sprej <dig> increased intracellular calcium and induced the sea urchin sperm acrosome reaction  <cit> . when the protein sequence of sprej <dig> was deduced, the rej domain appeared to match only one other protein, which was hpkd <dig>  sprej2- <dig> were discovered next,  <dig> and  <dig> having 11tm and being similar to hpkd <dig> and hpkdrej, whereas, sprej <dig> and  <dig> lacked this large tm domain and had either one or two tm. sprej1- <dig> are the only sprej proteins with crds. sequencing the crds from six species shows that these lectin domains are subjected to positive darwinian selection  <cit> , indicating that they are probably important in gamete recognition  <cit> . hpkd1l <dig> and 1l <dig> each contain one crd, but carbohydrate ligands binding these proteins remain unknown. the other sugar binding domain found in these proteins is the single sea urchin egg lectin domain  in sprej <dig> and hpkd1l <dig>  the suel lectin in the sea urchin egg has specificity for galactose  <cit> .

hpkd <dig> is involved in mechanotransduction, regulation of cell growth, cell spreading and differentiation  <cit> . four hpkd <dig> proteins and four sprej proteins contain cation channel domains. there are no experimental data for possible functions of the sprej5- <dig> proteins. to generalize, pkd <dig> family proteins are large transmembrane glycoproteins, which bind to smaller proteins to regulate signal transduction pathways and ion channel activities. sprej1- <dig> are definitely sperm plasma membrane proteins that are concentrated in different parts of the sea urchin sperm  <cit> . however, the membrane compartments of sprej5- <dig> in gametes, embryos and adult tissues remain unknown. with the exception of sprej <dig>  all sprej and hpkd <dig> proteins have putative tm helices.

"pkd repeats", which are 50– <dig> residues and have similarity to the immunoglobulin fold, are present in some of the sea urchin and human proteins. hpkd <dig> has  <dig> pkd repeats,  <dig> of them in tandem. with the exception of hpkd1l <dig>  all human and sea urchin proteins have either complete or partial rej domains. the sprej and pkd <dig> family proteins are the only proteins known to contain both pkd repeats and rej domains. experimental work suggests that pkd repeats and rej domains might have the same function in allowing the force mediated, reversible unfolding of these domains, permitting extension and retraction of the external portions of these enormous proteins as they link to the surfaces of other cells  <cit> . this research used single molecule atomic force spectroscopy to show that application of a stretching force to one hpkd <dig> molecule resulted in the unfolding, one at a time, of the pkd repeats. releasing the stretching force allowed the repeats to refold. the same phenomenon was found for the rej domain of hpkd <dig>  the data indicating that the unfolding of the rej domain occurred in approximately  <dig> steps. homology modeling suggests that there are  <dig> folded fibronectin-iii domains within the rej domain of hpkd <dig>  <cit> . in addition to a putative function in making sprej and pkd <dig> proteins capable of great elasticity, the rej domain is also known to be required for cleavage of hpkd <dig> in the gps domain, a process necessary to make a functional hpkd <dig>  <cit> .

this study is the first to show the developmental expression of sprej in sea urchin embryos. sprej <dig> and  <dig> transcripts could not be found in embryos at our level of detection, indicating that these two proteins are probably not important for early development. sprej <dig> may be important during oogenesis, but remains at lower than unfertilized egg levels during development . sprej <dig> and  <dig> transcripts are also higher in eggs than in embryos. sprej <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> transcripts show dramatic increases after  <dig> hours of development, suggesting that they are important for development of the gastrula, prism and pluteus stages. sprej <dig> transcripts are low in unfertilized eggs, increase to  <dig> hours and then decrease thereafter, suggesting that this protein is important for blastula formation. future work on sprej proteins will involve in situ hybridization and antibodies to localize these transcripts and their proteins at different developmental stages.

rt-q-pcr analysis of adult tissue expression of sprej transcripts indicates that, relative to the other sprejs, sprej <dig> and  <dig> have dramatically high tissue-specific expression patterns . sprej <dig> is the only sprej with relatively low expression levels in testis. it was previously shown that sprej <dig> is localized in the plasma membrane covering the acrosome vesicle and flagella of sea urchin spermatozoa, but its expression in nongametic cells of the testis has not been studied. to generalize, except for sprej <dig> in testis, and sprej <dig> in muscle/test, most adult tissues contain easily detectable levels of sprej transcripts. study of muscle/test preparations may reveal important functions of sprej proteins.

the sea urchin genome is  <dig> megabases , whereas the human is  <dig> megabases. that the sea urchin has  <dig> sprej genes, while the human has five, shows either that humans lost ancestral pkd <dig> orthologs, or conversely, sea urchins gained new sprej genes. all five hpkd <dig> proteins have  <dig> tm, whereas only four of the sprej proteins have  <dig> tm. the unusual secondary structure predictions of sprej7- <dig> make them interesting candidate proteins for further study. sprej <dig> is odd in having six putative tm and a split rej domain. sprej <dig> and  <dig> with only one putative tm, have no homology to any known domain upstream from their partial rej domains. sprej <dig> also has the extremely ser rich region close to the n-terminus. sprej <dig> is the oddest one in having a rej domain, but no tm segments. interestingly, all the genes encoding these proteins are transcribed in embryos or adult tissues. continued studies of these novel sprej genes and their proteins may aid in discovering generalities about their functions.

CONCLUSIONS
the sea urchin contains  <dig> sprej genes that are within the pkd <dig> gene family. all  <dig> are transcribed in either embryos or adult tissues. from amino- to carboxyl-termini, these sprej proteins usually contain: pkd repeats, a rej domain, a gps domain, a plat/lh <dig> domain and from 1– <dig> transmembrane segments. the predicted secondary structures of sprej7- <dig> are very different from other sprej/pkd <dig> proteins. their future study may help define the multiply functions of the pkd <dig> family proteins.
