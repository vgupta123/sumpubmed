BACKGROUND
the chondrichthyes  are one of the three extant major clades of jawed vertebrates and comprise two sister-groups; the elasmobranchs  and the holocephalans . although relatively species-poor by comparison to their osteichthyan  relatives , they occupy an important phylogenetic position as the sister-group to all other jawed vertebrates and as one of the first lineages to diverge after the two rounds of whole genome duplications that occurred early in vertebrate evolution  <cit> . despite this, there have been relatively few studies dealing with chondricthyan genomics. those that have been carried out have usually used cartilaginous fish as the outgroup to studies of bony vertebrates  <cit> . one problem is the large size of many chondricthyan genomes, which range from  <dig>  to  <dig>  gb with a median value of  <dig>  gb or roughly twice the size of the human genome  <cit> . venkatesh et al.  <cit>  completed a  <dig> × coverage draft survey of the elephant shark  genome , having chosen this species because of its smaller genome. additionally, a little skate  genome project has been approved by the national human genome research institute. however, there is currently little information available on patterns of genome evolution within the cartilaginous fish. to start to rectify this omission, we undertook the sequencing and analysis of a complete hox cluster from the little skate.

the hox genes play important roles in determination of anterior-posterior patterning during embryonic development  <cit> . their clustered organisation in the genome is a consequence of their origin from tandem gene duplications and is intimately associated with their expression during development. to date, all invertebrate lineages have been found to have only a single set of hox genes, generally arranged in a single hox cluster. in contrast, vertebrates have multiple more compact clusters, with four being present in tetrapods  as a result of two rounds of whole genome duplication at the base of the vertebrates. teleost fish have up to eight clusters and, within teleosts, the salmonids have at least thirteen as the result of additional genome duplications  <cit> . furthermore, teleost hox clusters are known to evolve at a faster rate than those of tetrapods, making it difficult to identify ancient conserved non-coding sequences  <cit> . two hox gene clusters  have been fully sequenced from a chondrichthyan . because of this, and the availability of the complete sequence of the hoxa cluster of the senegal bichir  - a member of the earliest diverging lineage of ray-finned fish and therefore unaffected by the whole genome duplications which increased hox cluster number in teleosts - we chose to analyse the hoxa cluster of little skate , a member of the oldest extant lineage of elasmobranchs  <cit> . together with the data from the more recently diverging horn shark and outgroup holocephalan sequences we can for the first time carry out a comparative genomic analysis within the cartilaginous fish.

RESULTS
size of chondrichthyan hoxa clusters
the  <dig>   <dig> bp sequence of the little skate bac clone 0081h <dig>  contains the full hoxa cluster as deduced by comparison to the published horn shark and elephant shark clusters  <cit> , as well as those of other vertebrates . although coelacanth has a hoxa <dig> gene, we do not believe that this gene is present in either skate or horn shark because of the distribution of conserved non-coding elements between the three species. thus a conserved element found 5' to hoxa <dig> in coelacanth is present 5' to hoxa <dig> in little skate and horn shark. the distance from the start codon of hoxa <dig> to the stop codon of hoxa <dig> comprises  <dig>  bp, strikingly similar to the  <dig>  bp figure for the horn shark despite the genome size of the horn shark being around twice the size of that of little skate . this similarity is also reflected in the intergenic distances within the clusters themselves . if the larger size of the horn shark genome is due to an expansion of repetitive dna, then this is clearly not reflected in the overall size of the hoxa cluster. indeed gnathostome hox clusters are renowned for being free of repetitive dna  <cit>  . it is currently not possible to determine the total length of the hoxa cluster in the elephant shark, since the draft genome sequence has relatively short contigs  <cit> . however, several contigs contain the full coding sequence of single hox genes so for these genes it is possible to compare gene length between the three chondrichthyans . in these cases, the horn shark and little skate are virtually identical, whilst the elephant shark typically has slightly larger total gene lengths.

the little skate and horn shark values are remarkably similar, whilst the elephant shark typically has larger values, despite its smaller overall genome size.

sequence conservation in chondrichthyan hoxa clusters
within the little skate hoxa cluster, only  <dig> bp codes for protein . hox gene coding sequence is typically around 95-98% identical at the amino acid level between the two species. turning to non-coding dna, an alignment of the little skate hoxa cluster with the orthologous regions of other vertebrates  reveals a striking level of sequence identity between the two elasmobranchs even at reasonably stringent  alignment conditions of ≥ 70% identity over a  <dig> bp window. this is especially surprising given that the skates are thought to be the sister-group to all other extant elasmobranchs  <cit>  and therefore must have diverged from them in the late triassic or early jurassic at least  <dig> million years ago. even if skates and rays are not the sister group to other elasmobranchs, the divergence time of little skate and heterodontus must still be at least  <dig> million years ago, based on the age of the oldest fossil heterodontids and batoids  from the toarcian stage of the early jurassic  <cit> . a comparable figure would be the divergence of the marsupial and human lineages around 162- <dig> million years ago  <cit> .

ultraconserved regions in chondrichthyan hoxa clusters
ultraconserved elements  were originally defined as regions of  <dig> bp or more conserved at 100% identity between human and rodent genomes  <cit> . recently, stephen et al.  <cit>  identified a large number of ultraconserved elements that are 100% identical over ≥  <dig> bp in at least three placental mammals and wang et al.  <cit>  found that 41% of these uces were present in the elephant shark genome at an average identity of  <dig> %. of the  <dig>  uces identified by stephen et al.  <cit> , thirty are located in the human hoxa locus  and of these, fifteen are also found in little skate . with the complete sequence known for the hoxa cluster of two species of chondricthyan, it is now also possible to look for uces conserved within the cartilaginous fish. we find  <dig> regions of ≥  <dig> bp that are conserved at 100% identity between little skate and horn shark, nine of which overlap with coding regions and two of which are conserved at 100% identity over  <dig> bp , of these,  <dig> are identifiable  in the hoxa clusters of a sarcopterygian  and a non-duplicated actinopterygian . this very high degree of conservation of ultraconserved elements between little skate and horn shark is surprising given the length of time that has passed since the divergence of these two elasmobranchs. by comparison, there are only three uces conserved absolutely between the hoxa clusters of human and marsupials , species that have been separated for approximately the same period of time. if the elephant shark genome is taken to be approximately 75% complete  <cit>  one would expect to find ~ <dig> of the  <dig> uces conserved between skate and horn shark in this species. in fact, only three uces  are missing from the current genome assembly, with the remaining  <dig> generally being present at 95-98% identity and five  present at 100% identity. again, this level of conservation is surprising since holocephalans have been separated from the elasmobranchs for at least  <dig> million years . a comparable figure for the human genome would be the divergence of human and frog ; species which have been separated for at least 330- <dig> million years and in which only a single hoxa ultraconserved element at 100% over ≥  <dig> bp is found. if the conservation threshold is lowered to 90%, then there are still only nine elements conserved between human and frog, five of which overlap with hox coding sequences.

predicted non-coding rna in chondrichthyan hoxa clusters
vertebrate hox clusters are known to contain several micrornas  which are known to be involved in anti-sense regulation of hox genes both within and across clusters  <cit> . the microrna located in the hoxa cluster  is known to regulate hoxa <dig> in the mouse through a reduction of protein level, rather than mrna destabilisation  <cit>  and has several potential binding sites in the 3'utr of the hoxa <dig> gene. there are four potential mir196b binding sites in the 3' utr of horn shark hoxa <dig>  <cit>  and these are also found in the little skate sequence, although there is also an additional site at the beginning of the skate hoxa <dig> 3' utr. bioinformatic identification of microrna targets is complicated by the fact that the mirna-target binding can include mismatches and gaps and often involves only a small part of the mature mirna  <cit> . interestingly, the polypterus senegalus hoxa cluster has retained mir196b despite the loss of the hoxa <dig> gene, lending support to the suggestion that mir196b has other targets within vertebrate hox clusters  <cit> . we have identified four putative non-coding rnas  in the little skate bac sequence through the prediction of stable stem-loop secondary structures. one predicted rna is the known mir196b, indicating that the analysis can reliably recover ncrnas. the second predicted rna is located upstream of hoxa <dig> and is found only in the little skate. the third is located within the intron of hoxa <dig> and is conserved between little skate, horn shark, elephant shark and indonesian coelacanth, but not in teleosts or tetrapods. the final predicted ncrna is more problematic, having an unusual secondary structure in skate and an even more unusual structure in elephant shark . closer examination of this rna suggests that it may not be functional, since it is located near to several repetitive elements  in both skate and elephant shark and the first  <dig> bp  show numerous strong hits to many cartilaginous fish sequences on genbank  as well as a very large number of hits to the elephant shark genome sequence. it is possible that this prediction actually reflects two repetitive elements in opposite orientations suggestive of a stable stem-loop structure.

repetitive dna
vertebrate hox clusters are usually free of complex repeats. however, the little skate hoxa cluster contains a  <dig> bp region between hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig> which shows high  identity to the deu-domain and 3'-tail region of sacsine <dig> identified by nishihara et al.  <cit>  in the dogfish shark . sacsine <dig> is a  <dig> bp trna-derived sine related to the sine <dig> family of zebrafish and thought to be derived from the l <dig> clade of lines. the little skate sine fragment lacks the 5' promoter for transcription by rna iii polymerase, indicating that it is a non-functional retroposon although it may have accumulated some other function which accounts for the degree of sequence conservation to sacsine <dig>  alternatively, the little skate sine may represent a recent retroposition into the hox cluster which has been inactivated by the loss of the 5' promoter region. the orthologous region of the horn shark hoxa cluster shows no sequence similarity to the little skate sine fragment and it will be interesting to trace the evolution of this sine within other members of the rajidae. repeatmasker  <cit>  identifies  <dig> bp  of the little skate bac clone as being repetitive, of which only  <dig> bp  is located in the gene-containing region between hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig>  the same region of the horn shark hoxa cluster contains only  <dig> bp  of repetitive dna, despite the larger genome size of horn shark. aside from the sine fragment in the little skate cluster, the rest of the repeats are simple-sequence elements such as mononucleotide tracts  or microsatellites with a repeating unit of 2- <dig> bp. it seems likely therefore that the constraining force on repetitive dna in vertebrate hox clusters is not the preservation of precise intergenic distances  but rather the exclusion of alternative transcriptional start sites in line or sine promoters which may disrupt the tightly controlled expression of hox genes during development.

both the skate and horn shark hoxa clusters contain a number of guanine-rich sequences . regions such as this have been shown to be involved in transcriptional regulation of genes through the formation of stable four-stranded structures  and it is possible that these sequences may be involved in transcriptional control of the hoxa genes. the quadparser program  <cit>  identifies  <dig> putative g4-forming regions in the little skate bac sequence, nine of which are located within the coding region between hoxa <dig> and hoxa <dig>  the orthologus region in horn shark contains  <dig> such sequences and although some relative positions appear to be conserved  these do not appear to be homologous based on conservation of both the g <dig> quadruplex and surrounding sequences. because of this, it appears unlikely that g <dig> dna plays an ancestral role in hoxa gene regulation, although it is still possible that there are some cell- or species-specific requirements for the g <dig> structures in non-embryonic hox expression.

CONCLUSIONS
the little skate hoxa cluster is strikingly similar to that of the horn shark in terms of both sequence conservation and intergenic distances despite the two lineages having been separated by at least  <dig> million years. the available data from the ongoing elephant shark  genome project suggests that the hoxa cluster of this species is also highly conserved with respect to the skate and horn shark despite having been separated from them for around  <dig> million years. comparisons of the human hoxa cluster to those of marsupials and amphibians reveal a much lower level of sequence conservation over similar periods of time, indicating either a faster rate of molecular evolution in the tetrapod and mammalian lineages or a slower rate of evolution in the cartilaginous fish. this finding echoes the suggestion of wang et al.  <cit>  that uces and protein-coding genes are evolving more slowly in elephant shark compared to other vertebrates. if the level of conservation seen in the chondrichthyan hoxa clusters in reflected across the entire genome then this will complicate attempts to identify functional conserved non-coding elements within the cartilaginous fish using phylogenetic footprinting. this is an important consideration given the two cartilaginous fish genomes currently in the pipeline and the likely increase in this number due to recent advances in genome sequencing technologies.
