BACKGROUND
chromosomes are remarkably conserved across vertebrates, showing striking conservation of gene content and gene order of substantial regions of synteny over millions of years. for example, the karyotypes of different bird species are extremely similar
 <cit>  and comparative chromosome painting of squamate reptiles  macrochromosomes shows ancestral homology dating back to the early jurassic
 <cit> .

in remarkable contrast to this deep conservation, and surprising, considering their critical role in reproduction, sex chromosomes show a lack of homology and frequent rearrangements and transitions between and even within lineages
 <cit> . the most stable and conserved vertebrate systems are in therian mammals , and birds and snakes . these three chromosome systems, that is, xy of mammals, zw of snakes and zw of birds show no genetic homology and are thought to have evolved independently
 <cit> . the evolutionary dynamism of sex chromosomes is more obvious from the distinct forms of xy and zw chromosomes among vertebrates even within taxonomic families
 <cit> . it is this lability and the role of the sex chromosomes in the fundamental trait of sex determination that makes non-mammalian vertebrates of extreme interest for studying the processes behind genome organization and evolution
 <cit> .

sex chromosomes are generally thought to have evolved from a homologous autosomal pair, when one partner acquired a sex determining gene
 <cit> . accumulation of sexually advantageous mutations near the sex determining locus led to selection for suppression of recombination, which in turn accelerated the loss of active genes, deletions and insertions from the sex specific y or w chromosomes
 <cit> . the loss of genetic material and accumulation of repetitive sequences on the y or w is obvious in many species as cytological heteromorphism. this process of repeat accumulation is rapid and stochastic, generating various intermediates between homomorphy and extreme differentiation in squamate reptiles , and variation in the gene content as can be seen in the y chromosome of different mammals
 <cit> .

despite the discovery of xy and zw sex chromosomes in the early 19th century
 <cit> , few master sex determining genes have been identified. these include sry in therian mammals
 <cit> , and a variety of genes in fish and frog: dmy in medaka 
 <cit> , gsdf in medaka 
 <cit> , dmw in clawed frog 
 <cit> , sdy in rainbow trout 
 <cit> , and amhy in patagonian pejerrey 
 <cit> . in all but three cases  in medaka)
 <cit> , master sex determining genes are transcription factors, in so far as they appear to act by up- or down-regulating transcription in the vertebrate sex differentiation pathway. this newly discovered diversity in regulation suggests that the de novo evolution of master sex determining genes from genes that are not involved in sex differentiation can occur in vertebrates. it occurs less frequently than those that are involved in the sexual differentiation pathway. however, due to recent advancement in molecular genetics and genome sequencing technologies, novel master sex determining genes are likely to be discovered at an accelerating rate, in turn discovering novel mechanisms of sex determination.

reptiles are of particular interest because they display astonishing variation in the sex determining system. they are represented by species which display all types of chromosomal system  and temperature-dependent sex determination , as well as species in which the two modes of sex determination interact
 <cit> . this diversity is well established in the literature, so it is remarkable that little is known of the genes involved. non-avian reptiles remain the only vertebrate group in which no master sex determining gene has been identified. they therefore promise to yield novel insights into vertebrate sex determination.

the best-studied sex chromosomes among non-avian reptiles are those of snakes
 <cit> . like birds, snakes have a zz male zw female system, and z gene content is conserved across all species so far examined. however, gene mapping shows that the sex chromosomes of snakes are not homologous to those of birds or mammals
 <cit> , nor to those of a zw turtle , a zw gecko , a zw dragon lizard  or an xy green anole 
 <cit> . four genes that are z-linked in g. hokouensis are autosomal in the dragon lizard pogona vitticeps <cit>  and in snakes
 <cit>  and five genes that are z-borne in snakes and birds are autosomal in the dragon lizard p. vitticeps <cit> . even within dragons , comparative mapping of a sex-linked marker shows that the zw sex microchromosomes of three australian agamid species  are homologous, but their homology does not extend to a fourth species, ctenophorus fordi <cit> . thus there is likely to be a number of independent origins of the sex chromosomes, not only between two families of lizards , but also among closely related species in the same subfamily.

the central bearded dragon, p. vitticeps, is a powerful model for the study of the evolution of sex determination because it has differentiated sex chromosomes
 <cit> , but phenotypic sex can be reversed by high temperatures, producing all female individuals
 <cit> . thus, sex in p. vitticeps is determined by the interplay between genotype and environment, producing genotype-phenotype discordant individuals. discovering novel sex determining genes in this species will therefore broaden our understanding of how sex is genetically determined, as well as of how environment can regulate genetic machinery. this species has  <dig> pairs of chromosomes –  <dig> pairs are macrochromosomes and  <dig> pairs are microchromosomes
 <cit>  – with female heterogamety 
 <cit> . the sex chromosomes are microchromosomes and the w chromosome is larger than the z
 <cit> . the w chromosome is also highly heterochromatic
 <cit>  which suggests that its sequence content is different from the z and that an amplification of repetitive dna is likely to have occurred during its evolution.

we previously reported the isolation of z and w linked markers, developed a genetic sex test and sequenced a  <dig>  kb region of the sex chromosomes
 <cit>  in pogona vitticeps. in this study, we extend the sequenced region of the p. vitticeps sex microchromosomes to 352 kb using a bac walking approach. we report  <dig> open reading frame  including three gene family members , and eight major groups of repetitive elements. comparative analysis of this partial sex chromosome sequence, allowed us to identify additional potential candidate sex chromosome genes in p. vitticeps. one of these genes, r-spondin  <dig> , has a central role in vertebrate ovarian differentiation
 <cit>  and we evaluate it as a candidate sex-determining gene in p. vitticeps.

RESULTS
isolation and physical mapping of pogona vitticeps sex chromosome bac clones
ten bac clones were isolated by genomic library screening with previously identified sex linked sequences
 <cit>  and chromosome walking. we sequenced five of the  <dig> bac clones, which ranged in length from 98 kb to 202 kb , while the remaining five bac clones overlapped the sequenced clones. reads from all five bac clones were assembled into a single contiguous sequence of 352 kb . analysis of this partial sex chromosome sequence revealed that the contig contains the previously identified w marker pv72w and contig c <dig>  but not the z marker pv71z
 <cit>  . this implies that the contig is likely to have w chromosomal origin and the contig therefore represents partial w sequence . the bac clones were physically mapped by dna fish as well as by fiber fish to verify their location on the sex chromosomes . the intensity and pattern of hybridisation signals of two colour dna fish with bac clones pv151_p <dig> and pv151_d <dig> were different between z and w chromosomes. primary hybridisation of the bac clones was to the z and w chromosomes, with signal on the w chromosome more intense than that on the z chromosome . terminal hybridisation signals on the long arm of chromosome  <dig> suggested these bac clones may share some repetitive elements with the nor-associated heterochromatin .
pogona vitticeps


two of the largest bac clones, pv151_p <dig>  and pv237_p <dig>  , which represent the two ends of the 352 kb contig and overlap in the middle, showed green, orange and yellow  fluorescent signals on chromatin fibers  confirming our physical map of bac clones . the observation of multiple regions of green and orange on a single fiber suggests repetition of sequences contained within the bac outside the contig . as a control for comparative analysis between sex chromosome and autosome sequences, substantial genomic sequences were also obtained from three autosomal bac clones .

sequence analysis of the partial sex chromosome contig
we used genscan
 <cit>  to analyze sequence of this contig. this identified the contig as an isochore type  <dig> with  <dig> % gc content. genscan also predicted  <dig> orfs . they ranged between  <dig> amino acids  to  <dig> aa . blast  analysis of these orfs supported the predictions for the protein-coding genes, opioid receptor, delta  <dig>  and regulator of chromosome condensation  <dig>  and three zinc finger protein genes, znf <dig>  znf <dig> and znf <dig> .

only the top hits based on e-values are listed.

the repetitive sequence content of sex chromosomes was examined using repbase-giri
 <cit> . analysis of repetitive sequences of the sex chromosome bac clones revealed the highly repetitive nature of p. vitticeps sex chromosome sequences . for example, one of the smallest sex chromosome bac clones, pv03_l <dig>  contains 41% repetitive sequences of which 43% are non-ltr retrotransposons . overall, ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons constituted the bulk of the repetitive sequences of the sex chromosome bac clones. we compared this composition with that of three autosomal bac contigs. in general, sex chromosome bac clones have three times more repetitive sequences . autosomal bac clones showed no preferential accumulation of any specific repetitive sequences .

we also investigated the accumulation of microsatellite repeats within the 352 kb sex linked contig using msat commander
 <cit> . our analysis identified  <dig> str loci consisting of three di-nucleotide , three tri-nucleotide , eight tetra-nucleotide , and two penta-nucleotide  repeat motifs within the 352 kb sex linked contig. at least five of these loci were found to be amplified on the w chromosomes . these loci therefore provide opportunities to develop sex-linked markers.

comparative analysis of the sequenced region
comparative orthology analysis revealed that orthologues of oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> are part of a conserved homologous syntenic block  in other vertebrates . this region is not on the sex chromosomes of these other species, confirming the independent origin of the dragon sex chromosomes.

analysis of genes in this hsb identified a candidate sex determining gene for p. vitticeps, the mammalian ovarian differentiation gene r-spondin  <dig>  since, we did not find rspo <dig> sequences within the sequenced region, we cloned and mapped the dragon rspo <dig> orthologue.

cloning and characterization of rspo1
we screened the bac library using primers designed from sequences obtained from a testis transcriptome . using this approach we isolated two rspo1-containing bac clones . these bac clones were annotated using genscan
 <cit> , revealing  <dig> and  <dig> orfs respectively . blastp
 <cit>  analysis of those orfs identified  <dig> genes from the region surrounding rspo <dig> in other amniote species; figure 
 <dig>  additional file
2), corresponding to the conserved hsb homologous to chicken chromosome  <dig> and human chromosome  <dig> 

we also cloned cdna of a homologue of rspo <dig> in p. vitticeps by pcr amplification of rna using primers designed against p. vitticeps’ testis transcriptome derived rspo <dig> . we sequenced three cdna clones, finding consensus sequences of the two fragments  <dig> and 956 bp length which partially overlapped. the total length of the consensus sequence covered by the two fragments was 1347 bp.

to eliminate the possibility that rspo <dig> gene sequences reside on sex chromosomes in this species, we directly sequenced the pcr products from  <dig> phenotypic males and  <dig> phenotypic females. direct pcr product sequencing was interrupted by the presence of a polymorphic imperfect pentanucleotide repeat  in the intronic region between exon  <dig> and exon  <dig> . the successfully sequenced regions comprised between  <dig> % and  <dig> % of the amplicon, although those regions uniformly had a high percent identity with the rspo <dig> genomic reference  from two fully sequenced bac clones . to circumvent this problem we cloned and sequenced pcr products and confirmed the rspo <dig> sequence identity for the full length of the amplicon .

mapping rspo1
to determine if rspo <dig> lies with oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> on the sex chromosomes in p. vitticeps, we mapped two bac clones  containing rspo <dig>  each bac clone was physically mapped on to p. vitticeps metaphase chromosome spreads along with a p. vitticeps sex chromosome specific bac clone, pv03_l <dig> . these two colour fish experiments  showed hybridisation signals on the centromeric region of the w chromosome in females , as well as a single pair of microchromosomes in both males and females .

since this pattern could have been produced by shared repetitive sequences, we carried out a second round of fish with the rspo <dig> positive bac clone pv100_o <dig>  the sex chromosome bac clone pv03_l <dig>  and rspo <dig> cdna clone  on the same chromosome preparations. the cdna clone mapped only a pair of microchromosomes . because of the small size of the cdna clone , the hybridisation signal strength on chromosomes was weak and the frequency of hybridisation signals per cell was also low. only about 30% metaphase cells had signals and signals were usually on only one chromosome, which is usually common in fish mapping of cdna clones
 <cit> . the autosomal microchromosome to which rspo <dig> cdna clones mapped was identified by co-hybridisation with bac clone pv100_o <dig>  no metaphase cell had rspo <dig> cdna signals on sex microchromosomes identified by clone pv03_l <dig> . thus evidence from the hybridisation of cdna clone points to rspo <dig> residing on an autosomal microchromosome pair and not on the sex chromosomes. in addition, we performed two colour fish using two rspo <dig> bac clones  with male p. vitticeps’ specific c0t- <dig> dna as suppressor dna. both bac clones were hybridised onto the same pair of microchromosomes identifying their colocations . we did not observe any centromeric hybridisation signals on the w chromosomes, suggesting repetitive sequences were successfully suppressed by c0t- <dig> dna, which also confirm the cdna clone mapping, i.e. rspo <dig> is autosomal.

rearrangement of the rcc1-oprd1-rspo <dig> region in pogona vitticeps
a closer examination of the region encompassing rcc <dig>  oprd <dig> and rspo <dig> indicated that this region was rearranged during amniote evolution. although the gene content of this region is conserved between human chromosome  <dig> and chicken chromosome  <dig>  the genomicus database
 <cit>  has placed rcc <dig> and oprd <dig> on a putative amniote ancestral block different from that harboring rspo <dig>  a number of different breakpoints are observed in the rcc1/oprd <dig> region when gene arrangements of the predicted ancestral blocks are compared to human chromosome  <dig> and chicken chromosome  <dig> .

the two bac clones containing rspo <dig>  also contained  <dig> genes from the region surrounding rspo <dig> in other amniote species, but the sequences from these two bacs do not assemble well enough to determine whether gene arrangement is also conserved between p. vitticeps and other amniotes.

discussion
our study has characterized the largest contiguous stretch of physically mapped sex chromosome sequence  from a zz/zw lizard species. although this region represents only a small fraction of the sex chromosomes of p. vitticeps, it has revealed several features typically associated with sex chromosomes including the accumulation of large blocks of repetitive sequences.

the 352 kb of sex chromosome sequence that we have identified in this study showed large fold accumulation of ltr and non-ltr retrotransposons including cr <dig>  and lines . accumulation of such repetitive sequences are common features on sex chromosomes and have been reported for the sex chromosomes of many vertebrate species from insects to mammals
 <cit> . in particular, these repeats have been found to be preferentially accumulated on the sex chromosomes with bovb and cr <dig> repeats found on the mouse y chromosomes and the chicken z chromosomes respectively. it appears likely therefore, that these repeats may have converged, preferentially on the sex chromosomes in a number of taxa
 <cit>  perhaps acting as an evolutionary driver for the degeneration of sex chromosomes in vertebrates.

our sequencing and physical mapping strategy revealed two known protein coding genes in addition to three zinc finger genes, within the sequence on the p. vitticeps sex chromosomes. the gene oprd <dig> is a member of g-protein-coupled receptors, which constitute a vast protein family that performs a wide range of functions 
 <cit> . while the gene rcc <dig> is a eukaryotic protein which binds to chromatin and interacts with ran enzyme, a nuclear gtp-binding protein, to promote the loss of bound gtp and the uptake of fresh gtp, thus acting as a guanine-nucleotide dissociation stimulator 
 <cit> . the interaction of rcc <dig> with ran probably plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression. neither of these two genes is known to be involved with sex determination or gonad differentiation of other species and we have no direct evidence that oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> are involved in the p. vitticeps sex determination pathway. both are expressed in a range of adult mammalian tissues . thus these genes, though on the sex chromosomes of pogona vitticeps, are unlikely candidates for a sex determination function.

orthologues of oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> are located on a syntenic block that is conserved among amniotes . this synteny suggested an evolutionarily conserved arrangement, which would allow us to identify other genes on the p. vitticeps sex chromosomes. one of the genes in this conserved syntenic block, rspo <dig>  is involved in ovary differentiation in mammals. this gene was discovered by its mutation in a family with four xx males, and appears to work by activating beta-catenin pathway
 <cit> . it was therefore a good candidate for a role in gonad differentiation in p. vitticeps. however, it is unlikely to be a candidate for the master sex determining switch as our cdna clone and two colour bac fish mapping has unequivocally established its location on a single pair of autosomal microchromosomes. although, bac clones containing rspo <dig> sequence mapped to the w chromosome as well as an autosomal microchromosome, this is presumably because they contain repeats shared with the sex chromosomes, which can be suppressed by species specific suppressor dna . the absence of rspo <dig> from the sex chromosomes eliminates this candidate gene from consideration. importantly, comparative sequence analysis of this newly characterized p. vitticeps partial sex chromosome sequence showed no homology to genes or sequence on other vertebrate sex chromosome, implying that the zw sex chromosomes in this species evolved independently
 <cit> .

evolution of the dragon sex chromosomes seems to have involved genome rearrangements . the 352 kb contig contains only two genes  corresponding to chicken chromosome  <dig>  and they are surrounded by zinc finger genes, which are not present in other amniote species. intriguingly, p. vitticeps is not the only species for which a gene from the ancestral amniote specific synteny block containing oprd <dig> and rcc <dig> has ended up on a sex chromosome. for example, med <dig>  a gene adjacent to rcc <dig> in the predicted ancestral block, is located on the chicken z chromosome. is this merely coincidence, or is there a sequence in this region that has a selectable function in sex determination? in contrast, bac clones containing rspo <dig> contain a number of genes found adjacent to this gene in other species. we predict that most of the chicken chromosome  <dig> synteny block will reside on the same microchromosome pair in p. vitticeps as rspo <dig> and not on the sex chromosomes.

CONCLUSIONS
our study has demonstrated that the sex chromosomes of p. vitticeps share some characteristics of sex chromosomes observed in other vertebrate taxa, namely an accumulation of repetitive elements. however the p. vitticeps sex chromosomes also revealed new aspects of sex chromosome evolution that may inform us generally about the rapid evolution of novel sex chromosomes. of particular interest is our observation that a highly conserved syntenic region that contains rspo <dig> was disrupted prior to the formation the p. vitticeps sex chromosomes. this work provides the fundamental basis and anchor point from which we can walk to characterize the rest of the dragon w chromosome, and discover a putative sex determining gene.
