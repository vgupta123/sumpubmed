BACKGROUND
autoimmunity involves complex pathophysiological processes; however, no comprehensive model of inflammatory induction has been unraveled as yet. genetic and environmental immunologic factors, several hormones and stress have been implicated in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders  <cit> . moreover, the t cell receptor , with its extended repertoire derived from somatic recombination mechanisms, plays a potential role in human autoimmune disease  <cit> . animal and human genetic studies have shown that skewing of tcr vβ repertoire is a characteristic feature of some autoimmune disorders although still controversy exists on that issue  <cit> .

tcr vβ repertoire is assessed with two methodologies, cdr <dig> spectratyping, which is a genetic assay that provides mainly qualitative information about tcr vβ clonality  <cit> , and flow cytometry analysis, which provides a quantitative assessment of tcr vβ clones and is well established in the clinical setting  <cit> . in t cell-mediated organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as type  <dig> diabetes , tcr vβ repertoire analysis, using both spectratyping and flow cytometry, produced conflicting findings  <cit> . in systemic autoimmune diseases, like systemic lupus erythematosus , tcr vβ analysis has been conducted in adult populations using the spectratyping method and a marked oligoclonality of the tcr vβ repertoire has been reported, which is more prominent in patients with active disease  <cit> . it is likely that children with sle display a similar phenotype, although no data exist regarding the expression of the vβ chains in the pediatric population. the marked skewing of the tcr vβ repertoire observed in some sle patients has not been found in t1dm patients, although a comparative study in a pediatric population between an organ-specific disease, such as t1dm, and a systemic autoimmune one, such as sle, to our knowledge, has not been conducted as yet.

the aim of this study was to compare the peripheral blood cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire in children with t1dm and sle, in comparison to healthy age-matched controls of the same ethnic origin with the use of the flow cytometry assay.

RESULTS
a) healthy children
complete blood count values, immunoglobulin levels and lymphocyte subpopulation counts were normal in all healthy children. autoantibodies, either sle-specific or diabetes speficic , were evaluated and they were negative in all controls tested. there was an unavoidable male preponderance in the tested children , due to the higher frequency of anatomical abnormalities needing surgical reconstruction in boys.

mean values and standard deviations  of each distinct vβ family percentage on cd4+ lymphocytes of the  <dig> studied children are shown in table  <dig>  tcr vβ usage appears to be non-random varying from low values of  <dig> % for vβ <dig> and vβ <dig>  to high values of  <dig> % for vβ <dig>  additionally, in one individual the value of the vβ <dig>  chain was  <dig> %. the known polymorphism  in vβ <dig> subfamily was not detected in the population tested.

the increased/decreased usage of a vβ subfamily has arbitrarily been defined as mean value ±  <dig> or  <dig> standard deviations   <cit> . of the children tested,  <dig> individuals had increased usage  of one or more vβ lymphocyte populations and these findings concerned different vβ chains in each subject. seven children had an increased usage of mean value + 2sd and nine an increased usage of mean value + 3sd. of these  <dig> subjects,  <dig> controls presented with an increased usage in only one chain ,  <dig> controls had increased usage in two vβ subpopulations  and one control in five ones  . no discrepancies were noticed in the vβ <dig> and vβ <dig> chains.

enrolled infants and children were separated into three age groups, which were compared in order to find out possible differences in vβ expression at different age groups. table  <dig> displays median values and interquartile range of the cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire in the aforementioned subgroups as well as in the total population of the study. statistical analysis revealed no significant difference for each of the  <dig> tcr vβ subfamilies in the cd4+ t lymphocytes.

no age-related differences in cd4 + vβ expression were found among the three age groups of healthy greek children studied.

b) t1dm children
assessment of the cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire was performed in two ways: a) vβ repertoire of each t1dm patient was compared with the vβ mean values of the control group and b) statistical analysis was performed, in order to detect the presence of cd4 + vβ lymphocyte clones in the group of t1dm patients with different quantitative expression in comparison to the control group.

the increased/decreased usage of a vβ subfamily was defined as control mean value ±  <dig> or  <dig> standard deviations  <cit> . five patients  presented no abnormalities in all cd4 + vβ chains values when compared to controls . one t1dm patient had decreased usage of vβ <dig>  and in another one vβ <dig> value was  <dig> % . none of the healthy individuals had such low usage of these vβ chains. increased usage of several cd4 + vβ chains  was identified sporadically in t1dm patients. with the exception of vβ <dig> chain, increased usage of the mentioned vβ subpopulations were also found in healthy individuals. although the cd4 + vβ <dig> lymphocyte population increased usage was found in  <dig> t1dm patients when compared to the mean value of controls, statistical analysis showed a significant difference between the two groups  concerning the cd4 + vβ <dig> subfamily . this is expected, since values of the controls ranged between  <dig> % and  <dig> % while t1dm values ranged from  <dig> % to  <dig> %. it should be mentioned that  <dig> healthy children had values of the cd4 + vβ <dig> chain < 1% and  <dig> t1dm children had values > 1% . taking into account the very low number of cd4 + vβ <dig> cells analyzed and that the maximum coefficient of variation  was 20%, statistical analysis was adjusted to this cv. as shown in table  <dig>  the differences remained significant even after “narrowing” the mean values, adjusting for a 20% difference in the mean values of our measurements.

cd4 + tcr vβ repertoire observed in t1dm patients in comparison to controls was similar. low usage of the vβ chains is rarely found in patients with t1dm.

adjustment of statistical analysis for the cd4 + vβ cells for a maximum cv of 20% showed that differences between healthy controls and t1dm children remained significant. cv: coefficient of variation.

c) sle children
in the sle group, skewing in cd4 + vβ subpopulations was detected in the majority of patients when compared to healthy individuals. in contrast to healthy children and t1dm patients, which presented with a similar cd4 + tcr vβ repertoire pattern,  <dig> of the  <dig> sle children tested displayed concurrently marked increased  and decreased usage  of several cd4 + vβ subpopulations. this was noteworthy in one sle patient who displayed increased usage of the cd4+ vβ <dig> , vβ <dig>  and vβ <dig>  and a decreased one of vβ <dig>  and vβ <dig>   chains and in another one patient with high values of cd4+ vβ <dig> , vβ <dig>  and vβ <dig>  chains and very low values of cd4+ vβ <dig> , vβ <dig>  , vβ <dig>   and vβ <dig>  . markedly low values were found in the following cd4 + vβ chains: vβ <dig> , vβ <dig> , vβ <dig> , vβ <dig> , vβ <dig> , vβ <dig>  vβ <dig> , and vβ <dig>  the cd4 + vβ <dig> subpopulation had values of  <dig> % in three sle patients. however, this finding, as previously mentioned, was noticed in healthy children as well. increased usage of vβ <dig> was found in  <dig>  of vβ <dig> in  <dig>  of vβ <dig> in  <dig> and of vβ <dig> in  <dig> patients. it should be mentioned, though, that there were two sle patients with a normal repertoire at initial diagnosis. when statistical analysis was performed in order to compare the cd4 + vβ expression between sle and healthy children, significant differences in tcr vβ quantitative expression were noticed only for the vβ <dig> chain  . this was expected, since five sle patients presented with higher values of the cd4 + vβ <dig> chain than those of the control group  . only one healthy individual presented an increased usage of cd4 + vβ <dig>  but he displayed no other discrepancies of the rest cd4 + vβ subfamilies.

d) findings of t lymphocyte populations by flow cytometric analysis
the basic immunophenotyping findings of the t1dm and sle groups, when compared to controls, were as follows: a) increased expression of cd <dig> molecule in two sle patients and in one t1dm patient, b) elevated percentage of the cd3+ tcrγδ lymphocyte population  in two sle patients, c) increased expression of the hla-dr + cells in  <dig> of the nine sle children tested and d) absolute number of b lymphocytes  beyond normal values in one sle and in one t1dm patient. no difference in the cd5 + cd19+ expression was noticed among the three groups and the values  of the cd5 + cd19+ populations ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> % in all individuals tested.

discussion
flow cytometric analysis of the cd4 + tcr vβ repertoire performed in three different groups of children of greek origin, healthy, t1dm and sle ones, provided results similar to previous published studies, but with some differences.

as far as healthy children are concerned, the results of this study support the non-random usage of tcr vβ subfamilies in greek children, as observed in previous studies on normal adults and children  <cit> . there is also no statistical difference in t cell repertoire among the three pediatric age groups studied and this is in accordance to another pediatric population studied in the united kingdom  <cit> . many healthy individuals had also sporadically increased expression of cd4 + vβ chains as previously shown  <cit> . to our knowledge, analysis of the cd4 + vβ repertoire expression pattern in greek adults has not been conducted so far, so comparison with values of adults of the same ethnic origin could not be performed.

t1dm children had an almost same cd4 + vβ repertoire pattern with healthy individuals, with the exception of the cd4 + vβ <dig> chain which had increased expression in t1dm patients when compared to controls. previous studies have shown similar results, that is either no differences between the two groups  <cit> , or increased usage of other chains like the vβ <dig> one  <cit> . some putative explanations for the absence of consistency in the results among several studies could be the scarcity of published studies in human populations, the small size of the samples tested both in our study and others, as well as the different methodologies applied for the tcr repertoire assessment. it is still unclear though, whether the increased expression of cd4 + vβ <dig> in newly diagnosed t1dm children of hellenic origin is a constant finding in later stages of diabetes or not. large-scale multicenter longitudinal studies are required to clarify this issue. a similar confirmed polymorphism of the tcrv20s <dig> gene was found in the healthy sardinian population, but further research failed to relate this polymorphism with the high incidence of t1dm in sardinians  <cit> .

in contrast to t1dm patients, in sle patients skewing of the cd4 + vβ repertoire is far more prominent. this finding is in accordance to previous studies published in adults  <cit> . cdr <dig> spectratyping performed in the peripheral blood of  <dig> adult sle patients has shown a prominent usage of the vβ <dig> chain among other vβ subpopulations   <cit> . in the present study, in which flow cytometry was used, increased usage of the vβ <dig> chain in the cd4+ t cells of peripheral blood was found in the majority of sle children. higher values of other cd4+ vβ chains were also noticed in sle children in comparison to healthy ones, but they concerned individual patients. our results are difficult to compare with previous studies published in adults, not only because of the different methodologies used  or to different samples studied  but also because of the limited number of the studies conducted in that field. larger scale analysis in populations categorized according to age, to time of the study held , to sex, to ethnicity and to methodology used could provide further insight on the role of vβ repertoire not only in autoimmune disease pathogenesis but also in its clinical significance as a prognostic factor in the case of sle.

limitations of the present study are the limited number of the patients studied, but this is due to the rarity of lupus in children in the greek population and to the fact that only patients upon the initial diagnosis were selected in order to avoid alterations in their immunological profile that medication could induce. another parameter is the fact that evaluation of the vβ repertoire in each patient is not influenced by the number of the patients investigated. although genetic evaluation was not performed, all previous published studies in immune mediated diseases have showed that there are no discrepancies between the results from flow cytometric analysis and spectratyping, enhancing the reliability of flow cytometry. finally, the cd8+ vβ lymphocyte subpopulations were not analyzed, and therefore it is not known whether there are abnormalities in the repertoire of children with diabetes or lupus or not.

as far as immunophenotyping analysis is concerned, no major differences among the groups were noticed. regarding the role of the cd5 + cd19+ population in autoimmune process, its expression was quite similar in the three groups studied. this finding is in accordance with other studies in adult sle patients, but not with studies in t1dm patients, in whom increased expression was observed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first comparative flow cytometric analysis between an organ-specific autoimmune disease, t1dm, and a systemic one, sle, which underscores the importance of the tcr vβ repertoire in patients with auto-immune diseases. this study was possible because of the availability of an easily applicable method at a clinical setting, which enabled tcr vβ repertoire analysis prior to initiation of any treatment that could possibly be a confounding factor. abnormalities of the cd4+ tcr vβ repertoire quantitative expression were observed mainly in sle children. low usage of certain cd4 + tcr vβ chains was also far more prominent in lupus patients. only the cd4 + tcr vβ <dig> and cd4 + tcr vβ <dig> lymphocytes were significantly increased in t1dm and sle children, respectively. however, the potential role of these lymphocyte clones in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity remains to be clarified.
