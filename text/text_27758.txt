BACKGROUND
the turbot  is a flatfish with increasing commercial relevance in europe with a current annual production of ~ <dig>  tones  <cit>  with an increasing consumer demand worldwide. thus, turbot production significantly increased in northern china during the last decade. however, fish disease outbreaks collapsed its production in  <dig>  with economic losses estimated to amount several hundred million euros  <cit> .

it seems clear that one of the major concerns for turbot aquaculture is disease control. intensive culture conditions in fish farms favors the proliferation of pathogens and the consequent economic losses associated with disease outbreaks. hence, a comprehensive knowledge of the immune system of commercially important fish species is required  <cit> . the immune-prophylactic control of fish diseases through vaccination, probiotics and immunostimulation has been undertaken since long ago  <cit> , whereas genetic programs on disease resistance, specifically in turbot, clearly require further investigation. obtaining resistant broodstock is an appealing solution to control diseases in front of the economic cost of vaccines, treatments and the possible generation of resistances against antibiotics.

another major concern for the aquaculture industry is fish reproduction. like in other vertebrates, reproduction in turbot is controlled by the brain-pituitary-gonad axis, which integrates environmental signals and controls the production and secretion of the major hormones involved in controlling the reproductive cycle, including the onset of puberty  <cit> . furthermore, turbot exhibits one of the largest cases of sexual dimorphism for growth rate in favor of females among aquacultured species  <cit> . therefore, there is an interest in the turbot aquaculture industry to produce stocks with as many females as possible in order to increase biomass. gonad development is a complex biological process in which an undifferentiated bipotential gonad is transformed into either a testis or an ovary  <cit>  according to sex determination and differentiation  <cit> . external factors such as temperature, ph or social behavior can directly influence gonadal development in some fish  <cit>  and, consequently, affect sex ratio. understanding the process of gonadal development can greatly aid in the control of sex ratios in finfish aquaculture. however, in turbot there is a lack of information of genes involved in reproduction and their interactions. the induction of gynogenesis suggested a xx/xy system of sex determination  <cit> , but later studies involving the analysis of progenies from sex-reversed parents revealed a zw/zz system  <cit> . linkage maps were developed  <cit>  and led to the identification of the major sex-determining region  <cit>  and facilitated the characterization and mapping of sex-associated markers  <cit> , although the sex determining gene is  still unknown.

despite recent increases in the number of expressed sequence tags  for flatfish  <cit> , their resources are still limited when compared to those available for salmonids . particularly in turbot, only  <dig>  entries were found but this number was recently raised up to  <dig>  contigs  <cit> . during the last few years, efforts have been done to create a comprehensive turbot database with a large number of gene sequences available based on the immune response to the most common different pathogens of industrial relevance  <cit> . these include aeromonas salmonicida subspecies salmonicida, a bacterium capable of causing 100% mortalities in just 7 days after challenge  <cit> , and the parasites philasterides dicentrarchi and enteromyxum scophthalmi, which are responsible for severe fish outbreaks  <cit> . therefore, the first turbot database was originally created with almost ten thousand high-quality ests sequences  <cit>  . from this database, a first custom oligo-microarray  was successfully designed  <cit>  and applied for evaluating expression profiles of genes involved in defense against pathogens  <cit> .

next generation sequencing  strategies have positively affected genetics research over the last few years and their advantages have been applied to many research fields.  <dig> flx titanium is a massive pyrosequencing strategy which generates medium-size single reads uncovering large amounts of dna sequences providing much deeper sequencing coverage than it is possible with conventional sanger sequencing  <cit> . sequencing small subsets of the genome such as the transcriptome is an attractive alternative for gene discovery in species whose genome is still not available, and fish are not an exception. for example, in guppy  the sequencing of a total of  <dig> megabases  produced the first reference transcriptome for this fish species  <cit> . in the self-fertilizing hermaphroditic mangrove rivulus, kryptolebias marmoratus, the identification of more than  <dig>  sequences provided the first insights on the mechanisms underlying the response to environmental stresses and chemical toxicities  <cit> ; and in the gilthead sea bream , the fast skeletal muscle transcriptome was described  <cit> . in particular, the reproductive system of the lake sturgeon  has also been studied by resorting to modern pyrosequencing and it has been useful for the discovery and evaluation of candidate sex-determining genes and xenobiotic-responsive genes in the gonads  <cit> .

another approach to improve the aquaculture production is based on the application of molecular markers such as microsatellites or simple sequence repeats  and snps. these markers are the basis for genetic mapping and comparative genomic analysis, which are in turn used for detection of quantitative trait loci  and for marker assisted selection  programs  <cit> . several types of genetic markers have been developed and investigated in turbot  <cit>  and many of them have already been mapped  <cit> . recently, a genome scan for sex-determination  <cit>  and resistance/survival to a. salmonicida <cit>  and p. dicentrarchi <cit>  using the genetic map identified several consistent qtls and associated markers in turbot, which suggests the existence of genetic factors underlying these characters and supports their application in genetic breeding strategies. the advents of new high-throughput sequencing technologies, which produce extensive sequence data, are providing new opportunities to increase the amount of molecular markers, as demonstrated in the sturgeon, where hundreds of snps were discovered  <cit> .

overall, the improvement of the turbot aquaculture industry by selecting, on one hand, the most resistant broodstock and, on the other hand, female-biased batches is a priority challenge. the purpose of this study was to increase turbot database information for genes related to the immune and reproductive systems by creating a powerful tool for genomic research in this species. the turbot database was updated with genes obtained both by sanger sequencing from immune-related tissues after challenges with the myxozoan parasite e. scophthalmi and by a  <dig> flx titanium run from gonad and brain-hypophysis at different stages of development. description and comparison of the two sequencing strategies, annotation procedures, and construction of a larger database, the support for microsatellites and snp discovery, and for designing a pilot-microarray platform, are presented.

RESULTS
the increase of known immune-related genes in turbot by sanger sequencing
the progression in the construction of the turbot database is summarized in table  <dig>  first, the turbot  <dig> database was created from almost ten thousand high-quality est sequences from three cdna libraries of three immune relevant organs  generated from turbot infected with a. salmonicida subspecies salmonicida and p. dicentrarchi, as well as from non-infected fish  <cit> . the turbot  <dig> database included several resource sequences: i)  <dig>  sequences from seven microsatellite-enriched dna libraries from muscle tissues  <cit> ; ii)  <dig>  ests available in public databases  <cit> , which were loaded on the turbot database and clustered with the set of the existing est; and iii) sanger sequencing data from two new cdna libraries generated from several immune tissues  after challenging with the myxosporean parasite e. scophthalmi produced a total of  <dig>  sequences . together, sanger-based sequencing generated  <dig>  sequences with an average length of  <dig> base pair , constituting the turbot  <dig> database. the assembly of all these available data consisted of  <dig>  putative transcripts of which  <dig>  were contigs and  <dig>  singletons. a high level of redundancy was found , which is usually observed when non-normalized cdna libraries are used  <cit> , but it constitutes an appropriate approach to obtain a first picture of the immune response  <cit> .

a total of  <dig>  out of the  <dig>  unique sequences  in turbot  <dig> database displayed significant matches with sequences available in public databases with e-values equal or less than  <dig> e- <dig> . gene ontology  annotation classified sequences as follows:  <dig> in biological process ,  <dig> in cellular component  and  <dig> in molecular functions .

 <dig> pyrosequencing of the turbot brain-hypophysis-gonad axis transcriptome
the turbot  <dig> database described above contained  <dig>  sequences, many of them related to the immune response. however, further exploration of this database revealed that sequences related to reproduction, the other major issue for turbot farming, were underrepresented. in order to obtain more sequences of genes related to sex phenotype and reproduction control, and for isolation of est-associated genetic markers, a 454-pyrosequencing run was performed from the brain-hypophysis-gonadal axis by using tissues of  <dig> turbot individuals at different stages of sexual development. table  <dig> summarizes the statistics of the turbot pyrosequencing normalized library. raw data generated  <dig> , <dig> sequences. these sequences were filtered using roche’s software with default settings. after filtration,  <dig> , <dig> sequence reads  were obtained with an average length of 286 bp. sequences were assembled into  <dig>  contigs  with a mean length of  <dig>  bp . about half of these contigs  were longer than 500 bp and their distribution by range was the highest for the 200–499 bp length, followed by the 1–199 bp length and finally by the 500–999 bp length . the average depth coverage per contig was of  <dig>  sequences . reads obtained in this high throughput sequence analysis have been submitted to the ncbi sequence read archive under accession number sra <dig> 

table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> longest contigs obtained from the  <dig> run with their annotation. they ranged from  <dig>  bp to  <dig>  bp and their average coverage depth per nucleotide ranged between  <dig>  and  <dig> . cytochrome c oxidase subunit  <dig> was the longest contig. table  <dig> shows the top  <dig> contigs with the deepest coverage . although a normalized library was used, most contigs with the deepest coverage corresponded to protein ribosomal genes. however, genes involved in the reproductive system such as the histone deacetylase complex or the epididymal secretory protein, which is highly expressed on the surface of ejaculated spermatozoa  <cit> , were also present.

about half of the contigs obtained in the  <dig> run were successfully annotated and classified into gene ontology categories. more precisely, contigs exclusively obtained by the  <dig> run were functionally classified in the bp , cc  and mf  categories.

creation of the turbot  <dig> database
the sequencing strategies used, i.e. traditional sanger and high throughput  <dig>  yielded a high amount of transcriptomic sequences both from immune and reproductive systems in turbot. with all the information generated, a new turbot  <dig> database was created and stored in a web-based portal for exploitation, first by the consortium participating in this project and then publically once the project is finished by the end of  <dig>  cap <dig> software was used to assemble the sequences coming from all sanger-based libraries  and the contigs from 454-pyrosequencing , yielding  <dig>  unique sequences , thus reducing redundancy among sequences . the number of sequences generated in one single pyrosequencing run  was almost four times higher than the six libraries sequenced by sanger together . when comparing to public turbot resources, our strategy allowed increasing by  <dig>  the number of novel sequences identified for the first time in turbot.

annotation of the turbot  <dig> database
nearly half of the sequences  <dig> / <dig>   were automatically annotated by autofact  and produced a significant blast hit against at least one of the public databases. a venn diagram showing the number of sequences that matched with some of the commonly used databases is shown in figure 2a. a total of  <dig>  sequences shared significant blast hit against all databases including uniref <dig>  kegg, pfam and others , while  <dig>  contigs shared blast-hits against uniref <dig>  kegg and other databases and  <dig> with pfam and other databases. about 2/ <dig> of the contigs  were successfully classified into gene ontology categories:  <dig>  according to bp,  <dig>  to cc and  <dig>  to mf categories . the number of sequences exclusively assigned to each functional category was  <dig>  for bp,  <dig> for cc and  <dig>  for mf.

most significant blast-hits were obtained against a small number of species represented in public databases including model fish species , cultured fish species  and two mammalian species  . g. aculeatus was the highest represented species followed by a group including t. rubripes, o. latipes and t. nigroviridis, all these species and turbot belonging to the acanthopterygii superorder  <cit> .

figure  <dig> summarizes the number of sequences representing the different 2nd level go terms in the turbot  <dig> database. cellular process  and metabolic process  were the most represented categories within bp terms , but categories related to immune function had also a high representation: response to stimulus , viral reproduction , immune system process  and death . the reproductive system was also represented by the reproduction  and reproductive process  categories, and to a lower extent by growth and cell proliferation. cell and cell parts categories  followed by organelle  were the highest represented within cc terms . finally, within mf terms binding  and catalytic activity  were the most represented categories followed by transporter activity  and structural molecule activity  .

identification of genes related to the immune response
the knowledge of the immune system of fish has greatly increased recently. however, there are still many fish diseases which produce important losses to industry because still there is no an effective strategy for their control, including vaccines. the immune system of fish is composed of non-specific and specific immune defenses, being the first more important than in higher vertebrates  <cit> . examples of innate immunity include anatomic barriers, mechanical removal of pathogens, bacterial antagonism, pattern-recognition receptors, antigen-nonspecific defense compounds, the complement pathway, phagocytosis, and inflammation  <cit> . in the present study, the main organs of the immune system of fish such as head kidney , spleen and thymus  were included. in addition, other organs such as the liver, a multifunctional organ with innate immune functions in mammals  <cit>  and poorly studied in fish, and the pyloric caeca, the target organ of the myxozoan parasite, which also plays a role in immunity  <cit> , were included as well.

next-generation pyrosequencing has become an important tool for transcriptomic studies, enabling the identification of new immune molecules that are expressed upon activation of the immune response. a remarkable recent example is the study of the liver transcriptome of orange-spotted grouper  after virus infection  <cit> . it seems very likely that developments related to fish immunology will have a significant impact for obtaining a new generation of vaccines against diseases. a disadvantage of turbot is that neither the genome nor the complete transcriptome are available yet and, therefore, important information about immunity and stress related genes and their expression is lacking. many genes were identified previously in turbot using classical sanger sequencing in response to a. salmonicida and p. dicentrarchi <cit> , vibrio harveyi <cit>  and nodavirus  <cit> . however, the number of genes related to the immune system in this species remained low. recently, pereiro et al.  <cit>  used 454-pyrosequencing after different immune stimulations to provide a rich source of data to improve the knowledge of s. maximus immune transcriptome. their results revealed a large number of contigs and singletons with potential immune function in turbot and identified many of the proteins involved in the main immune-pathways in humans, showing the potential of pyrosequencing. although our  <dig> run was not specifically from immune-related tissues, after combining the sanger and pyrosequencing data, a significant number of genes associated to essential functions directly or indirectly related to innate and acquired immunity were detected in the turbot  <dig> database . most of the immune-related sequences  were derived exclusively from the  <dig> run and only  <dig> and  <dig> sequences from sanger or mixed sanger- <dig>  respectively. we found several novel genes, including components or family members related to acute phase response and inflammation, stress and/or defense response and in the coagulation cascade. many of the genes shown in the immune pathways presented by pereiro et al. <cit>   could be identified, but also some other important immune genes were identified here for the first time in turbot, a selection of which is shown in table  <dig>  relevant examples include dff <dig> subunit, a substrate for caspase- <dig>  which triggers dna fragmentation during apoptosis; bcl-xl, an anti-apoptotic protein; traf <dig>  which regulates activation of nf-kappa-b and jnk, playing a central role in the regulation of cell survival and apoptosis; traf <dig>  which mediates signaling from members of the tnf receptor superfamily as well as the toll/il- <dig> family; irak <dig>  which plays a critical role in initiating innate immune response against foreign pathogens; jnk, involved in cell differentiation and proliferation, neurodegeneration, inflammatory conditions and ap-1-mediated cytokine production; tollip, which is involved in the turnover of il1r-associated kinase, interleukin- <dig> receptor  trafficking and regulation of the imflammatory signaling; fyn, which participates in the downstream signaling pathways that lead to t-cell differentiation and proliferation following t-cell receptor  stimulation; nck, which plays a pivotal role in the t cell receptor -induced reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of the immunological synapse; dlg <dig>  which is involved in lymphocyte activation; cot, which promotes the production of tnf-alpha and il- <dig> during t lymphocyte activation; cd <dig>  involved in t-cell activation; gads, involved in b and t cell activation; and grb <dig>  which provides a critical link between cell surface growth factor receptors and the ras signaling pathway. the obtained data complements and expands the known spectrum of immunity related genes and provides a valuable platform for more detailed analyses of the immune response in fish in general a turbot in particular.

several immune related pathways were also identified in the turbot  <dig> database. chemokine signaling is an important immune pathway due to the fundamental role of chemokines in providing directional cues for the trafficking of leukocytes to sites of inflammation but also it has been implicated in dendritic cell maturation, macrophage activation, neutrophil degranulation, b cell antibody class switching, and t cell activation. the data infers that chemokines influence both the innate and acquired phase of an immune response to host insults. thus, the protein richness of this pathway in the turbot  <dig> database was described . most members intervening in this pathway were identified showing the usefulness of the turbot  <dig> database for gene discovery.

identification of genes related to reproduction
to date, fish gonad-related ests are poorly represented in public databases. a first attempt to identify genes related to gonad development in male and female turbot was carried out by cdna-aflp technology and several specific sequences could be identified  <cit> . however, the amount of information presently available is still scarce and thus a small number of sex-specific sequences have been identified. here, the use of the  <dig> flx titanium sequencing allowed obtaining a large number of gene sequences  and their subsequent assembly and gene annotation led to the identification of a total of  <dig>  annotated sequences related to reproductive function. this means that sequences corresponding to many genes of the brain-hypophysis-gonad axis, expressed first during the process of sex differentiation and then during gonadal maturation, have been identified . functional annotation terms classified all those sequences in a total of  <dig>  go terms. this is the first time that sex-related genes have been massively identified towards understanding gonad development and maturation in the turbot.

table  <dig> shows  <dig> relevant genes with a well-known function in the reproductive system, most of them identified for the first time in turbot. the annotation, as shown by the low e-values, was reliable for all of them. some of these are genes involved in testicular development, such as the androgen receptor-alpha , müllerian inhibiting substance , sry-related genes containing a hmg box , spermatogenesis associated  <dig> or steroid 11-β-hydroxylase. ar has been cloned in several cultured fish species like the rainbow trout   <cit>  and the european sea bass  <cit> . ar mediates the androgen effects by binding to specific dna recognition sites and regulating the transcription of many different processes  <cit> . in fish, amh expression levels are consistently higher in males than in females during sex differentiation, suggesting that this factor plays an important role in testicular development  <cit> . the sox gene family encodes an important group of developmental regulators, involved in sex determination in fish  <cit>  and other key processes such as development of the central nervous system  <cit> . furthermore, the important transcription factors sox <dig> and the sox <dig> were identified.

another group of identified genes in turbot is involved in ovarian development. this is the case of the cytochrome p <dig> aromatase , zona pellucida glycoprotein  or the zygote arrest protein. cyp19a is a key enzyme in the hormonal steroidogenic pathway that mediates the conversion of androgens into estrogens  <cit> , with two isoforms with specific regulation and tissue distribution  <cit>  and it has been cloned in several cultured fish species like european sea bass  <cit> . higher expression of cyp19a is found in female gonads when compared to male gonads from early development and recently it has been shown that different methylation levels of its promoter are related to temperature during the thermal sensitive period  <cit> . zpgs are glycoproteins found in the fish chorion, which mediate species-specific sperm binding  <cit> . zpgs are encoded by multiple gene families and here several of them have been identified . the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein  and similar proteins containing star-related lipid transfer  are responsible for the synthesis of sex steroids and other hormones like cortisol in response to specific stimuli  <cit> . here, we were able to identify two different start genes, start <dig> and start  <dig> 

gonadotropins  control the complex endocrine system that regulates gonadal growth, sexual development and reproductive function, and are secreted by the hypophysis  <cit> . three forms of gnrh in the brain and pituitary of the turbot have been identified so far  <cit> . one of the main gonadotropins in vertebrates, as well in fish, is the follicle-stimulating hormone . its receptor, fshr, is found in male and female gonads and although cloned in other cultured fishes such as the sea bass  <cit> , here is it identified for the first time in turbot.

not only genes expressed in somatic cells but also genes expressed in the germ cell line were present in the turbot  <dig> database. vasa plays an important role in germ cell determination and development and is an essential factor for primordial germ cell formation and migration to the germinal ridge  <cit> . in fish, vasa was first cloned in zebrafish  <cit>  and later in rainbow trout  <cit>  but also in turbot .

table  <dig> shows the pathways related to reproduction identified in the turbot  <dig> database with more than 50% coverage. here, pathways are ranked based on the number of genes included in the database with respect to the total number of genes present in each pathway: oocyte meiosis , circadian rhythm , mtor signaling pathway , erb signaling pathway , progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation , gnrh signaling pathway , insulin signaling pathway , androgen and estrogen metabolism , steroid biosynthesis , wnt signaling pathway , and notch signaling pathway . additional file  <dig> shows the progesterone-mediated oocyte maturation pathway highlighting the presence and absence of proteins in the turbot  <dig> database. the exposure to either insulin-like growth factor  <dig>  or the steroid hormone progesterone breaks oocyte meiotic cell division arrest and induces meiosis resumption and therefore the transformation of the oocyte into a mature, fertilizable egg  <cit> . oocyte maturation is also dependent on the activation of a cascade of genes, which activate the mapk  signaling pathway  <cit> . the key activity driving meiotic progression is the maturation-promoting factor , a heterodimer of cdc <dig>  and cyclin-b <cit> . in fish, the importance of some of the genes involved in the oocyte maturation pathway has been described so far  <cit> . here,  <dig> out of  <dig> genes belonging to this pathway were found, showing the coverage of the generated turbot  <dig> database.

overall, our results show that the approach followed was successful since most of the well-known reproduction-related genes found in other species have been also identified in turbot essentially at once.

genetic markers
an important emerging application of high-throughput  <dig> sequencing is the identification of molecular markers from genomic dna. in fact, recent studies have identified  <dig> polymorphic microsatellite by pyrosequencing in an endangered fish species of china  <cit>  and  <dig> microsatellites loci from the threatened freshwater yarra pygmy perch   <cit> . however, few studies have been conducted to search for cdna-associated microsatellites, like those identified in the atlantic herring   <cit> , despite the potential for targeting candidate genes  <cit> .

due to their location within genes, est-ssr markers frequently display a high degree of transferability between related species, thus facilitating comparative genomics strategies with model species. in addition, high sequence coverage in principle allows the assessment of variability in silico, aiding for selection of polymorphic markers. we searched for new microsatellite markers within our sequence database to identify sequences with different repeat motifs. our search revealed  <dig> sequences containing  <dig>  new ssrs identified from  <dig>  sequences, with  <dig> est sequences containing at least two ssrs. of these,  <dig> showed significant hits in blast with an e-value cut-off of ≤  <dig> e- <dig> and, thus, were annotated. the frequency of est-ssrs observed in the turbot transcriptome was  <dig> %, and the distribution density was  <dig>  microsatellites per mb. ssr motifs were identified using criteria based in a minimum number of repeats for di-, tri-, tetra- or pentanucleotide motifs . similar to other vertebrate genomes, the most abundant repeat type was ac  followed by aag , agg , agc , and ag . the frequency of microsatellites was inverted regarding the length of the motif, dinucleotide microsatellites being the commonest ones and pentanucleotides the less abundant . in addition, those microsatellites with a lower number of repeats were more frequent than those with a higher number of repeats, the most common class being n =  <dig> . further,  <dig> % of loci contained more than  <dig> repeat units. all the new microsatellite-containing ests showed sufficient flanking sequence length for primer design, and  <dig>  polymorphisms of them appeared polymorphic after in silico analysis.

a total of  <dig>  snps were detected in  <dig>  of the  <dig>  contigs using the three filters set in the qualitysnp pipeline  <cit> . only clusters with at least  <dig> est sequences  were selected to minimize the detection of snps caused by sequencing errors. on average, one snp per 196 bp was identified, which is a frequency in the order of that estimated in non-model species  <cit> . the types of detected snps according to different criteria are summarized in table  <dig>  among them,  <dig>  were transitions,  <dig>  transversions and  <dig>  indels. in addition, the majority of snps were detected in contigs involving a large number of sequences, which provides an additional support for their confidence.

the large amount of potential molecular markers found in this study will enable more detailed population and applied genomic studies. since these new markers are linked to genes, they will be useful as type i markers for population genomics screening in this species and for comparative mapping and fish evolutionary studies  <cit> .

pilot microarray and identification of natural antisense transcripts
to date, several custom microarrays have been designed in several non-model fish species. examples exist in rainbow trout  <cit>  gilthead sea bream  <cit> , european sea bass  <cit> , atlantic salmon   <cit> , common carp   <cit>  or senegalese sole   <cit> , but also in the turbot  <cit> . in the present study, samples from the reproductive and immune tissues were used to characterize their transcriptome using different sequencing strategies and de novo assembly to identify a large number of genes previously unknown in turbot. the assembled data present in the turbot  <dig> database was the basis to construct a pilot microarray towards a new gene-enriched updated version. one of the drawbacks of  <dig> sequencing technology is that it may produce false annotations of genes  <cit> , and since sequencing is not oriented as in cdna libraries used for sanger sequencing, it is not possible to know the dna sense strand of a gene unless it is confidently annotated. to solve these problems, and in order to identify the most reliable oligos for a definitive turbot microarray, a pilot microarray was developed. in this pilot microarray, oligos were designed both in forward and reverse sequence orientation. in addition, several filtration criteria were followed to analyze microarray data . this strategy allows, on one hand, to identify the sense strand of the non-annotated sequences, but also to identify false annotation of genes. on the other hand, this procedure also allows studying the frequency of putative natural antisense transcripts  in turbot transcriptome  <cit> .

the importance of nats, which can regulate eukaryotic gene expression, has emerged in the last decade  <cit> . a nat is a single-stranded rna sequence complementary to messenger rna and includes various classes of short rnas including micro rnas , promoter-associated transcripts and long non-protein-coding rnas  <cit> . the amount of nats in eukaryotic cells remains unclear. it had been reported that over 20% of human transcripts might form sense–antisense pairs  <cit> , but large-scale cdna sequencing suggested that antisense transcription is more common than previously thought  <cit> . recently, it has been shown that up to 72% of the transcripts had antisense partners in human and mouse transcriptomes  <cit> . high-throughput sequencing strategies have revealed a plethora of non-protein-coding transcripts from both genic and intergenic regions  <cit> . data on mirnas, one of the short nat classes, has been already published in rainbow trout  <cit>  and halibut hippoglussus hippoglossus <cit> . due to their increasing importance, the study of nats cannot be longer ignored in transcriptome studies.

the functionality of the oligos included in the pilot-microarray was checked by hybridizing the same rna used for the sanger and  <dig> sequencing strategies. to analyze microarray data two filtration criteria were applied . once the first filtration process was completed  <dig>  signals in forward and  <dig>  in reverse oligos still remained  . then, a second filtration with two additional filtering criteria  was performed to select the best performing oligo probes. as seen after this additional filtration process , among the  <dig>  probes there were  <dig>   with no signal . after the two rounds of filtration, a total of  <dig>  remaining oligos  yielded signal in at least one tissue  or in both. as a result of this filtration strategy, the remaining oligos were selected to be included in the updated turbot microarray. in the development of a custom microarray for the european sea bass, a similar strategy was followed to study nats expression  <cit> . although a lesser amount of sequences was designed for this purpose , identification of nats was also achieved  <cit> .

it is remarkable that after the second filtration,  <dig>  sequences  still showed signal in both strands in both types of tissues . these double hybridization signals could represent putative nats found for the first time in the turbot transcriptome. mirnas, are one of the most relevant short nats classes and function as regulators of gene expression at the level of translation, with an essential input in developmental processes  <cit> . due to their growing importance in regulating gene expression, several mirna databases have been already created. in table  <dig>  we show a selection of ten mirnas from those identified in the turbot  <dig> database including their number of reads, which could be considered as a gross indicator of their expression level. to our knowledge, these mirnas are the first to be identified in turbot. further work is being carried out on the turbot database for developing a consistent bioinformatic pipeline for mirna identification, as well as for their validation using a q-pcr approach.

CONCLUSIONS
this is the first time that the transcriptome of the reproductive and the immune systems of turbot have been widely explored together. both systems are essential for the survival of individuals and are of primary importance for commercial aquaculture. this study was designed to fill in the gap of genomic resources in turbot and therefore to improve available turbot sequence databases, specifically in genes related to reproduction. the large amount of generated sequences  resulted in one of the most complete available databases for flatfish, with more than half of the resources annotated by both gene and functional category. the detailed and focused sequence assembly and gene annotation strategies allowed the identification of several genes involved in the immune and the reproductive systems, being most of them involved in key functions. a large amount of genetic markers was identified, providing new tools for genomic studies. the performance of an informative pilot microarray was assessed and identification of putative mirnas was possible. thus, ngs technologies represent an essential tool to increase exponentially genomic resources in non-model species, opening new insights for our understanding of key biological processes and addressing production bottlenecks in their aquaculture.
