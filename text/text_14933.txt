BACKGROUND
tree nuts are recommended as an important resource of healthy diet in human populations throughout the world, since they are rich sources of monounsaturated fatty acids , polyunsaturated fatty acids , however low in saturated fatty acids   <cit> . recent scientific research has demonstrated that a high proportion of mufas or a high ratio of mufas to sfas reduces cancer death and incidence  <cit> . dietary linoleic acid  intake reduces low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and risk of coronary heart disease, hypertension and type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> . a recommended minimum intake levels for essential fatty acids are  <dig>  % linoleic acid plus o.5 % linolenic acid  to prevent deficiency symptoms in adults, while the sfas intake level keeps as low as possible  <cit> .

hickory  is one of the most productive woody oil-bearing plant in china. a mature hickory embryo contains more than 70 % oil and 90 % unsaturated fatty acids  <cit> . as a predominant composition of hickory oil, oleic acid  accounts for more than 70 % of the total unsaturated fatty acids content at maturation stage. besides oleic acid, other compositions include a moderate amount of linoleic acid  and low concentrations of palmitic , stearic , and linolenic acid   <cit> .

to date, knowledge of oil accumulation in plants is based almost on studies of oil seeds. the skeletal pathway of fatty acid and lipid synthesis leading to triacylglycerol  production is basically understood. the fatty acid de novo synthesis occurs in plastid with hundreds of annotation genes in arabidopsis  <cit> . acetyl-coa, the substrate of fatty acid synthesis, is generated from pyruvate under catalysis by plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex   <cit> . subsequently, acetyl-coa carboxylase  converts acetyl-coa to malonyl-coa as the first rate-limiting step of fatty acid de novo synthesis  <cit> . then, the carbon flux comes into reaction via fatty acid synthase , a multiple monofunctional enzymes complex. the series of enzymes catalyze acyl-acp and result in the generation of two saturated acyl-acps, i.e., 16-carbon palmitoyl-acp and 18-carbon stearoyl-acp which are subsequently desaturated by delta-9-stearoyl-acp desaturase . the resulting free long-chain fatty acids  are esterified by long-chain acyl-coa synthetase  and exported to endoplasmic reticulum for further participating acyl-editing by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase  and phosphatidic acid phosphatase   <cit> . as the long-chain acyl-coa and glycerol-3-phosphate  enter tag assembly, the sequential reactions in so-called kennedy pathway were performed by a series of enzymes  <cit> . in the last step of kennedy pathway, it is presumed that two isoforms of acyl-coa: diacylglycerol acyltransferase , the major enzymes catalyzing diacylglycerol  to produce tag, play different roles in seed development of both arabidopsis and oil crops. moreover, several transcription factors such as wrinkled <dig> , pii, and two isoforms of leafy cotyledon  play vital roles in plastidial glycolysis and pyruvate dehydrogenase action, and in lipid synthesis during seed maturation in arabidopsis  <cit> .

nevertheless, the issue of high contents of oil and mufa in tree nuts e.g., pecan, hickory, walnut and filbert was still not addressed. in this paper, dynamic morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics, and transcriptome sequencing during embryo development in hickory in two sequential growing seasons and a complementary comparison of transcriptome with high-sfa oil palm were employed to discover the hickory’s high-oil and high-mufa mechanism  <cit> . this work will give insight into the mechanism of oil deposition and fatty acids saturation conversion in the process of embryo development in oil seeds.

RESULTS
morphological and physiological-biochemical characteristics of developing embryo
the morphological, physiological and biochemical changes of developing embryo were tracked over the hickory seed development, and the trajectory of oil deposition in two successive growing seasons was depicted as fig.  <dig>  the embryos were developing from cotyledonary young ones on  <dig> dap  to maturation on  <dig> dap. the oil content was continuously accumulated from less than  <dig> to more than 70 % during the process. the dynamic oil accumulation was synchronous with the embryo development each year. according to the embryo dimension and its oil content, five developmental stages, i.e., early cotyledon stage, midcotyledon stage, late cotyledon stage, full cotyledon stage, and maturation stage, designated as s1-s <dig> in  <dig> and t1-t <dig> in  <dig> respectively, were chosen for rna-seq analysis.fig.  <dig> morphological characteristics, oil accumulation and temperature variation in the process of hickory embryo development. the solid and the dashed red lines indicate the curves of oil content during the embryo development in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. and, the solid and the dashed blue lines indicate the curves of top atmosphere temperature with the embryo development in two years, respectively. dap indicates day after pollination. s1-s <dig> or t1-t <dig> indicate  <dig> temporal developmental stages, i.e., early cotyledon stage, midcotyledon stage, late cotyledon stage, full cotyledon stage, and maturation stage in  <dig> and  <dig> respectively, and chosen for rna-seq analysis



moreover, the fatty acid compositions of hickory oil at different stages were further investigated . the contents of palmitic acid and stearic acid, which were two predominant compositions of sfas, kept low levels  even dropped gradually over the embryo development. on the contrary, the unsaturated fatty acid contents were more than 80% in stage  <dig> and climbed softly up to approximately 93% of total fatty acids at stage  <dig> and  <dig>  the oleic acid content was increasing from about 20 % at stage  <dig> to 80 % at stage  <dig> and keeping constant at stage 4– <dig>  rather, the mount of linoleic acid was high at stage 1– <dig> , but dropped rapidly down to roughly 10 % then kept low levels at the late stages. analogously, linolenic acid reached relative high levels  at stage  <dig>  and declined to 10 % or 8 % at stage  <dig>  then dropped rapidly down to single digits at stage 3– <dig>  it was noted that the ratio of mufas/pufas at t <dig> was significantly higher than that at s <dig>  correspondingly, an excessive high temperature  happened at t <dig> comparing to the normal s <dig> . in soybean seedlings, the mufa/pufa ratio increased as a temperature shift from  <dig> to 35 °c  <cit> . and increased mufas could have contributed to the maintenance of membrane fluidity in legume seeds  <cit> . these conforming results suggested that the hickory embryo produced more mufa and less pufa to confine lipid oxidation under the hot wave. taken together, a mature hickory nut contained more than 70% of oil, herein more than 90 % unsaturated fatty acids , less than 10 % sfas.fig.  <dig> the contents or ratios of the main fatty acid composition. a-e indicate the contents of c16: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig>  c18: <dig> and c18: <dig> at  <dig> developmental stages each year. f indicates the dynamic ratio of mufa to pufa  at  <dig> stages in 2 years. different lowercase letters denoted significant differences between different stages each year 



transcriptome sequencing in sequential growing seasons
to dissect the molecular metabolism of oil accumulation over the embryo development in hickory, ten mrna-seq databases  were assembled into  <dig>  contigs. and a total of  <dig>  genes were annotated through blastn searches against a local a. thaliana cdna sequence database. principal component analysis  was implemented for consistency analysis between rna-seq data of  <dig> and  <dig>  the pca plots showed that the first two principal components contained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % variances, respectively. apparently, the contribution of pc <dig> was much more than that of pc <dig>  hence, it sounded reasonable that the ten rna-seq datasets were well clustered . and the annual rna-seq datasets were also well-clustered, although s <dig> and t <dig> were somewhat deviated from other datasets each year. in order to analyze the gene expression pattern of the whole sequencing data, a total of  <dig>  differentially transcribed genes were clustered into  <dig> major patterns . furthermore, the differential-transcribed genes reflecting to the gene ontology at level  <dig> were classified into three functional groups, i.e., cellular component, molecular function and biological process . several functional groups related closely with lipid synthesis such as acetyl-coa carboxylase complex, lipid biosynthetic process, and lipid metabolic process were enriched. for instance, the functional group of acetyl-coa carboxylase complex belonged to cluster vii in  <dig> and cluster ii in  <dig>  suggesting that the transcriptional level of accase rose up to a peak at s <dig> and t <dig>  respectively. the functional group of lipid biosynthetic process belonged discretely to cluster ii, vi, vii and ix in  <dig>  but mainly to cluster ii in  <dig>  the fact hinted that the genes related to lipid synthesis were strongly transcribed at t <dig> for facilitating oil accumulation under the hot wave in  <dig>  furthermore, heat shock proteins  functioned in several patterns in  <dig> but functioned mainly in cluster ii pattern in  <dig> whose genes were transcribed higher to a peak at t2-t <dig> then did lower afterwards, suggesting that the thermotolerance of hsps alleviated proudly the injury of the hot wave  <cit>  .fig.  <dig> pca plots of ten rna-seq datasets normalized by log <dig> of fpkm in  <dig>  and  <dig> . the plots showed that the first two principal components contained  <dig>  % and  <dig>  % variances, respectively

dynamic differential transcription in lipid synthesis
the dynamic differential transcription of genes related with fatty acid de novo synthesis, tag assembly and reserve in two years was studied . in detail, the three subunits of accase , 3-ketoacyl-acp reductase , ketoacyl synthase ii , sad, fata and oleosins were up-regulated, while none was down-regulated at s <dig> stage, suggesting that the fatty acid synthesis initiated accelerating and storing the target products in oil bodies. simultaneously, the oil content rose from  <dig>  to  <dig>  % during stage 1– <dig>  moreover, the up-regulation of sad and fata provided a hint that unsaturated fatty acids became predominant constituents in the anabolites. at s <dig> stage, two accase subunits , kasiii, kar, enoyl-acp reductase , kasii, lacs, steroleosins, caleosins and oleosins were up-regulated, while fatb and ω- <dig> fatty acid desaturase  <dig>  were synchronously down-regulated. the fact demonstrated that the fatty acids were more rapidly synthesized and their corresponding lipids were instantly transferred to oil bodies for energy reserve. the down-regulation of fatb suggested that the unsaturated fatty acids rather than saturated ones was massively produced at this stage. the down-regulation of fad <dig> restrained the pufas output but promoted simultaneously the mufas output. meanwhile, the oil content rose sharply to  <dig>  %, and the content of predominant component c18: <dig> in oil reached  <dig>  %. the contents of c18: <dig>  c16: <dig> and c18: <dig> were  <dig>  %,  <dig>  % and  <dig>  %, respectively. on the whole, the contents and constituents of total lipids matched well with transcriptional levels of differentially-expressed genes which were associated with lipid synthesis. at s <dig> stage, ear was down-regulated, but other lipid-related genes did not meet the threshold of differential transcription. whatever, the slowdown of fatty acid synthesis caused a minor increase of oil content which rose no more than  <dig> percentage points to  <dig>  % with an elevated proportion  of c18: <dig>  a declined proportion  of c18: <dig>  and a constant proportion of other lipid components. at the last stage, the down-regulation of numerous genes involving in fatty acid de novo synthesis such as accase, mat, kasiii, kar, ear, kasii, sad, fata, and lacs led to a sharp decrease of fatty acid synthesis. nevertheless, several genes which dominated tag assembly or its storage, such as diacylglycerol acyltransferase , steroleosins, caleosins, and oleosins, were up-regulated, indicating that tags were accumulated and stored rapidly in oil bodies at maturity. as a result, the oil content reached  <dig>  % finally. interestingly, c18: <dig> made a significant decrease , while c18: <dig> did a distinct increase . as we know, fad <dig> is a specific enzyme which catalyzes c18: <dig> to c18: <dig>  <cit> . the differentially-transcribed fad <dig> kept a relatively high level at stage 1– <dig>  but declined sharply at the following stages. the dynamic transcription pattern of fad <dig> led linoleic acid and linolenic acid to high levels at early stages and low levels at later stages. however, no fad <dig> homolog could be identified from the two-year transcriptomic data. it was contradicted with the proportional linolenic acid in the process of embryo development. luckily, the discovery of plastidic fad <dig> in hickory smoothed the conflict over. in birch leaves, low temperature induced the expression of bpfad <dig> and bpfad <dig> and a synchronous increase of 18: <dig> occurred in tag  <cit> . elevated temperatures decreased the expressional level of fad <dig> in arabidopsis  <cit> . over-expression of fad <dig> imposed much greater heat sensitivity than does fad <dig> overexpression in arabidopsis and tobacco  <cit> . in hickory, the expressional levels of fad <dig> at t2-t <dig> were remarkably lower than those at s2-s <dig>  suggesting that fad <dig> compromised with the hot wave in  <dig>  consequently, it was presumed that the linolenic acid in the developing hickory embryo was predominately generated by fad <dig> in plastid rather than fad <dig> in endoplasmic reticulum.fig.  <dig> the differential transcription of lipid synthesis genes. the blue solid dot indicates the up-regulated gene repeat, while the red solid dot indicates the down-regulated gene repeat. the gray dot indicates the non-differentially expressed gene repeat. the upper and lower parts of each gene indicate the dynamic expression in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively



similarily, the differential transcription of these lipid-related genes in the subsequent growing season was detailedly described as fig.  <dig>  through a comparison of two-year data, the discrepancies of differential transcription of lipid-related genes between the two growing seasons were further explored as follows. at stage  <dig>  for instance, only ear was down-regulated in  <dig>  while a number of genes besides ear, such as α-ct, kasii, sad, fata, dgat <dig>  steroleosins, caleosins, and oleosins, were down-regulated in  <dig>  furthermore, it was noted that c18: <dig> content had a minor increase at t <dig>  while it did not happen at s <dig> yet. in addition, as the atmosphere temperature at s3-s <dig> stages kept constant, no gene was differentially-transcribed with an exception of ear up-regulation. however, as the atmosphere temperature at t <dig> stage fell down from  <dig> to  <dig>  °c, numerous genes for fatty acid synthesis, dgat <dig> for tag assembly, and three genes  related with energy reserve in oil bodies were down-regulated. together, the above-mentioned fact elucidated that the hot wave impaired little to the enzymes activities in lipid biosynthesis, while the dropping temperature could restrain their activities. it suggested that there lived a certain protective mechanism in hickory to accommodate the hot wave, which attracted us making a specific discussion below for addressing this issue.

furthermore, several crucial transcription factors were differentially transcribed over the embryo development in the two sequential growing seasons. for instance, the transcriptional level of wri <dig> was peaked at s <dig>  reduced at s <dig>  and down-regulated significantly at s5; while its transcription was up-regulated at t <dig> and down-regulated significantly at t <dig> stage. similarly, the transcriptional levels of another transcription factor pii went up at early  <dig> stages then declined afterwards in each growing season. other several transcription factors such as hsi <dig>  hsl <dig> and pkl were differentially transcribed at different stages. however, the transcription of lec <dig> and fus <dig> did not reach the threshold of significant difference over the entire embryo development in the two growing seasons.

accase transcription correlated positively with fatty acid de novo synthesis
plant accase acts as a key control point over the flux of carbon into fatty acids. the catalysis efficient of accase was determinant for transfer from photosynthate to lipid  <cit> . the dynamic transcription of accase subunits over the hickory embryo development in the two growing seasons was depicted in fig.  <dig>  of  <dig> bccp repeats, bccp- <dig> , bccp- <dig>  and bccp- <dig>  became dominant ones because their transcriptional levels rose at early stages and reached a peak at s <dig> stage, then fell down afterwards in first growing season. in regard to the second growing season, bccp- <dig> transcription kept a very low level, while the transcriptional levels of bccp- <dig> and bccp- <dig> were higher than those in first growing season . the result implied the different contributions of these bccp repeats for fatty acid de novo synthesis. considering the hot wave in  <dig>  the fact of the lower transcriptional level in  <dig> and higher level in  <dig> of bccp- <dig> could attribute to temperature variation. that is, this bccp repeat seemed a gene vulnerable to temperature disturbance, and the hot wave confined its transcription. conversely, bccp- <dig> and bccp- <dig>  particularly the latter, transcribed higher under the hot wave, suggesting that both bccp repeats accommodated the elevated temperature to ensure the normal lipid biosynthesis. of  <dig> bc repeats, bc- <dig>  transcribed at very low levels  < 10) over embryo development in 2 years; while bc- <dig>  transcribed at relative high levels, whose fpkm ranged  <dig> – <dig>  in first growing season and ranged  <dig> – <dig>  in second growing season . it was indicated that the bc- <dig> played an important role for the accase activity. among  <dig> repeats of α-ct subunit ,  <dig> repeats  showed a similar transcription pattern which was up-regulated continuously at stage 1– <dig> but down-regulated subsequently, while the transcription of the rest repeat  kept low all the time . the expression pattern provided a reasonable explanation for the rapid oil accumulation at third stage each year.fig.  <dig> temporal changes in transcriptional levels for skeletal lipid synthesis enzymes during embryo development in 2 years. a, b and c indicate the dynamic transcription of the  <dig> subunits  of accase in  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. and, d, e and f indicate the dynamic transcription of dgat <dig>  dgat <dig>  pdat and gpat <dig> in two years, respectively. all repeats of each gene are respectively shown in the panel



dgat <dig> and pdat played crucial roles in tag assembly
as a limited enzyme, dgat catalyzed the last step of tag synthesis  <cit> . in hickory, the transcription of all the three repeats of dgat <dig>  kept at a low level all along, while the sole dgat <dig>  repeat transcribed differentially in a wide range in both growing seasons . concretely, dgat <dig> was up-regulated continuously at stage 1– <dig> and down-regulated at stage  <dig> then up-regulated at stage  <dig>  the result certified the vital role of dgat <dig> rather than dgat <dig> in tag assembly in hickory.

phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase  implemented the direct transfer of a fatty acid from phosphatidylcholine to dag producing tag  <cit> . in first year, all the three repeats of pdat kept little transcribing throughout the entire embryo development. in second year,  <dig>  of the three repeats  still kept a subtle transcription all along . however, the remaining repeat, i.e., pdat- <dig>  was high transcribed over the embryo development. noteworthily, as dgat <dig> was high transcribed, pdat was low done synchronously, vice versa. the result demonstrated that the complementation of pdat and dgat <dig> impelled the tag assembly. it was further interpreted that dgat <dig> was responsible for catalyzing the last committing step of tag synthesis, while pdat kept silent as a reserve at moderate temperature. in case of unfavorable condition such as the hot wave in summer, pdat and dgat <dig> on behalf of phosphatidylcholine pathway and kennedy pathway respectively were triggered for ensuring the unaffected tag synthesis. in arabidopsis, pdat and dgat <dig> are the major enzymes with overlapping functions for catalyzing tag production  <cit> . dgat <dig> function remained unclear in arabidopsis. in some plants such as ricinus communis and vernicia fordii, dgat <dig> homologs were more highly expressed than dgat <dig> ones during seed maturation  <cit> . in r. communis and aleurites montana, dgat <dig> was proposed to be important for incorporation of unusual fatty acids into tag  <cit> . dgat <dig> was also abundant in olive  <cit>  and oil palm  <cit>  for accumulating normal tag. our study certified the roles of pdat and dgat <dig> and their overlapping functions in tag synthesis in different environments in hickory.

high transcription of sad and fad <dig> were associated with oleic acid production
sad plays a crucial role for de novo synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in plants  <cit> . among  <dig> repeats of sad in hickory, sad- <dig>  was transcribed remarkably, followed by sad- <dig> . the up-regulation of both repeats gave rise to produce abundant unsaturated fatty acids during s1-s <dig> or t1-t <dig> . fad <dig> encodes a ω- <dig> desaturase that converts oleic acid to linoleic acid  <cit> . in hickory, the fact of the high level at the first two stages and low level at later stages of fad <dig> demonstrated a dominant production of pufas in early embryo development and a major production of mufas in late embryo development. strikingly, the expression of sad was contrary to that of fad <dig> during stage 1– <dig> , suggesting that sad catalyzed rapidly the synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in the upstream of lipid biosynthesis, while fads controlled the ratio of mufas to pufas in the downstream. consequently, the perfect harmonization of both enzymes’ expression facilitated the high content of oleic acid.fig.  <dig> temporal changes in transcriptional levels for unsaturated fatty acid synthesis enzymes  and saturated fatty acid synthesis enzyme  during embryo development in 2 years. panels a, b, c and d indicate the dynamic expression of sad, fad <dig>  fata and fatb, respectively.



in arabidopsis, sad transcription was more abundant than any other enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis  <cit> . of  <dig> sad isoforms, at2g <dig> is the most highly expressed in arabidopsis seeds. of note, orthologs of at2g <dig> were also the most abundant in developing seeds of r. communis, brassica napus, euonymus alatus and tropaeolum majus  <cit> . however, the gene encoding the sad isoform in hickory with the highest transcription was at1g <dig> rather than at2g <dig>  implying a specific mechanism of fatty acid desaturation in this species.

comparison of high-lipid and high-oleate mechanism in oil plants
to gain insight into the high-lipid mechanism of in hickory, a comparison was implemented among transcriptome databases of lipid synthesis in hickory, oil palm and date palm which were derived from the open access . according to the literature  <cit> , oil palm accumulates up to 90 % oil in its mesocarp, while the closely related date palm accumulates almost exclusively sugars instead of oil. first, the transcript of accase was abundant in hickory and oil palm, but little in date palm. the expressional levels of the three subunits of accase in hickory, i.e., α- ct, bccp and bc, displayed a coordinated temporal pattern which went up to a peak at stage 3– <dig> and decline during late embryo maturation . the three accase subunits in oil palm were transcribed much higher than those in date palm during fruit development. also, the dgat homologs in hickory were transcribed actively during embryo development in two growing seasons , so did the homologs in oil palm. however, their paralogs of dgat transcribed less in date palm mesocarp. besides the two genes coding for committing enzymes which determined the synthetic direction and rate of the first step and the last step of lipid synthesis, other kernel genes coding for main enzymes in fatty acid de novo synthesis such as kasiii, kar, hydroxyacyl-acp dehydratase , ear, and kasii were transcribed as a coordinated pattern similar to accase in the three oil trees. interestingly, almost all important enzymes in kennedy pathway for tag assembly such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , glycerol-3-phosphate acyl-transferase , lysophosphatidic acid acyl transferase , pdat, and dgat were transcribed at low levels. the transcriptional levels of the first four enzymes in date palm seemed not significantly lower than those in oil palm. it was suggested that oil accumulation relied on the efficiency of fatty acid de novo synthesis rather than that of tag assembly except the last committed step of converting diacylglycerol  to tag catalyzed by dgat. three genes in oil body, i.e., oleosins, caleosins and steroleosins were transcribed considerably high in hickory than those in oil palm and date palm, suggesting that there lied a specific oil storage mechanism in hickory.

furthermore, the transcriptional level of fata was generally higher than that of fatb, which led to a greater production of unsaturated fatty acids than that of saturated ones in several plants seeds  <cit> . in r. communis, the transcriptional level of fata were 1000-fold higher than that of fatb. the ratio of fata to fatb provided an evidence for the very low content of sfas  in r. communis seeds  <cit> . the ratios of fata/fatb and sad/fatb in these plants were further calculated for unsaturation analysis . oil palm and date palm contained high content of saturated palmitic acid   <cit>  and low fata/fatb and sad/fatb ratios. these low ratios led both palms to a low proportion of unsaturated fatty acids and a high proportion of sfas. on the contrary, the ratios in hickory embryo reached maximums at stage 3– <dig> in the successive growing seasons, suggesting the rapid synthesis of unsaturated fatty acids in this duration. the fact illustrated the high unsaturation  of oil in hickory. together, the ratio of fata/fatb  could be applied for determining the saturated degree of oil.fig.  <dig> temporal changes in index of saturated degree during embryo development in 2 years. the value of fata/fatb and sad/fatb correlated negatively with the saturated degree. panels a and b indicate the dynamic value of fata/fatb and sad/fatb, respectively. 



glycolysis possibly provided precursors and energy for lipid synthesis
glycolysis converted sugar to numerous precursors for protein and fatty acid synthesis concomitantly producing atp by substrate level phosphorylation  <cit> . about 90 % of glucose fed to developing canola embryo was converted to pyruvate by glycolysis  <cit> . in hickory, the consistency of differential transcription profile between glycolysis and lipid synthesis was generally well confirmed .fig.  <dig> the differential transcription of glycolysis genes. the two-way arrow indicates a reversible reaction, while the one-way arrow indicates an irreversible reaction. the solid circle in yellow indicates a translocator. the value in brown indicates the ratio of total fpkm in  <dig> to that in  <dig>  while the green value indicates the fold change of fpkm at stage  <dig> in  <dig> to that in 2012



the conversion of glucose to glucose-6-phosphate  catalyzed by hexokinase  was the first and committing step in glycolysis  <cit> . a hxk homolog in hickory designated as hxk- <dig>  was intensively up-regulated at s <dig> and s <dig> and sharply down-regulated afterwards in first year, while the transcriptional level of the homolog climbed to t <dig> and kept the height at later stages in following year .fig.  <dig> temporal changes in transcriptional levels for committing enzymes  of glycolysis during embryo development in 2 years. panels a, b and c indicate the dynamic expression of hxk, pfk and pkp-β <dig>  respectively.



phosphofructokinase  was the other limited enzyme which catalyzed g6p to produce glucose  <dig> -bisphosphate   <cit> . of  <dig> pfk repeats, pfk- <dig>  and pfk- <dig>  were high transcribed in first year. however in second year, merely pfk- <dig> played a leading role, whose transcriptional level went up and reached a peak then fell down . interestingly, the sum of fpkm of pfk- <dig> and pfk- <dig> in each stage in first year was almost equivalent to that in second year. it led us to predict that the enzyme encoded by pfk- <dig> was of the better tolerance to the hot wave than other isozymes.

the third well-known limiting step was the biochemical reaction from phosphoenolpyruvate  to pyruvate catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate . the pkp activity was determined by β <dig> subunit. disrupting the pkp-β <dig> encoding gene caused a reduction of pkp activity and seed oil content  <cit> . in hickory, the pkp-β <dig> homolog  was transcribed relatively high at stage 1– <dig> and low at the last stage , suggesting that sufficient pyruvate was produced for meeting the demand of fatty acid de novo synthesis. noting that the pkp fpkm at each stage in second year was higher than that in first year, the glycolysis was possibly impelled for producing more atp and nadph to relieve excessive energy consumption causing by the hot wave.

constraint of lipid degradation became a guarantee for high lipid content
the oil content is governed by the dynamic balance between synthesis and breakdown and a deficiency in tag hydrolysis has been shown to cause an increase in oil deposition  <cit> . the first hydrolytic attack on the tag molecule in oilseeds is primarily catalyzed by sugar-dependent <dig> , an oil body-associated protein which hydrolyzes tag to free fatty acids and dag . suppression of the sdp <dig> during seed development enhances oil yield in b. napus  <cit> . moreover, peroxisomal abc-transporter <dig>  is the other important protein that transported a variety of substrates into peroxisomes for their subsequent metabolism by β-oxidation in arabidopsis  <cit> . due to their determinant roles in tag breakdown, the isoforms of sdp <dig> and pxa <dig> were studied for understanding the tag hydrolysis over the hickory embryo development. consequently, two sdp <dig> repeats and three pxa <dig> ones were uncovered from the transcriptome data. the transcription of both sdp <dig> repeats kept at relatively low levels whose fpkm value in two years was not more than  <dig> . furthermore, the three pxa <dig> repeats in hickory were also transcribed at low levels  . hence, the constraint of lipid degradation became a guarantee for high lipid content.fig.  <dig> temporal changes in transcriptional levels for committing enzymes  of lipid hydrolysis during embryo development in 2 years. panels a and b indicate the dynamic expression of sdp <dig> and pxa <dig>  respectively.



influence of hot wave on gene expression in lipid synthesis
the curve of the oil content in  <dig> coincided with that in  <dig>  showing little influence of the hot wave on the oil accumulation . the fact suggested that there lived a certain protective mechanism during embryo development to eliminate negative effects caused by the hot wave. as described above, the hot wave restrained heavily the transcription of accase subunits bccp  and bc , and a gpat <dig> repeat ; while it accelerated the transcription of other repeats of accase subunits bccp , a pdat repeat , and a fata repeat . these genes attempted to accommodate temperature variation through selective expression of different repeats for normal oil accumulation, suggesting that the multi-copy event in higher plants was required for adapting various survival environments.

besides the lipid-related genes, other differential-transcribed genes against the hot wave during embryo development were also explored. of them, the significantly up-regulated genes involved in aba signaling pathway, jasmonic acid biosynthesis, hsps, phospholipid signaling, sphingolipid biosynthesis, suberin synthesis and transport, and numerous transcription factors . for example, almost all the heat shock proteins expressed much higher in  <dig> than in  <dig>  particularly at stage  <dig> . as one of the heat shock transcription factors, the hsfb2a was transcribed the highest at t <dig>  suggesting its crucial role for high temperature tolerance  <cit> . together, the high transcriptional levels of genes related to lipid synthesis and thermotolerance and the low transcriptional levels of genes related to lipid degradation protected hickory normal embryo development and oil accumulation against the hot wave.fig.  <dig> temporal changes in transcriptional levels for heat shock proteins during embryo development in 2 years



potential genes related with lipid synthesis via co-expression network
in order to identify potential novel genes associated with the lipid biosynthesis in hickory, a co-expression network was constructed from a genome-wide co-expresser search for lipid-related genes. the final network encompassed  <dig> unigenes co-expressed strongly with  <dig> lipid-related genes . herein,  <dig> unigenes which homologs in other species were registered in ncbi-nr database were recruited as the potential genes, while the remaining uncharacterized ones in this database were abandoned for the time being due to the difficulty to further research . of the  <dig> unigenes with known function, several unigenes were associated directly with lipid biosynthesis, including two oleosin unigenes , one unigene coding for acyl-carrier protein , one uninene for phosphatidylinositol transfer protein , and so on . in addition, the other known unigenes contained one unigene coding for bp <dig> related with embryogenesis ; several unigenes related with resistance to stress, such as unigene <dig> coding for hsp, unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> coding for embryo dehydrins; unigene <dig>  unigene <dig> and unigene <dig> coding for ascorbate oxidase precursor, polyphenol oxidase, and chaperone for superoxide dismutase, respectively; unigene <dig> coding for ethylene insensitive  <dig> for resistance to biotic and abiotic stress; unigene <dig> coding for nsp-interacting kinase  <dig> ; unigene <dig> coding for kelch repeat protein for oxidative stress, etc. and several transcription factors such as ice <dig> and bhlh <dig> were uncovered. moreover, several glycolytic genes coding for sugar phosphate translocator, hexose transporter, etc. were also discovered. for instance, unigene <dig> co-expressed strongly  with unigene <dig> which encoded an oil body protein namely caleosin. through a local blast against the nr database, unigene <dig> was known as a heat shock protein in r. communis. it was inferred that some genes like unigene <dig> in hickory were triggered to accommodate various unfavorable environments including the hot wave to ensure the normal oil accumulation and energy reserve in oil bodies. furthermore, both oleosin unigenes  co-expressed strongly  with the transcription factor wri <dig>  unigene <dig> coding for acyl carrier protein  <dig> also presented a significant co-expression with the sad homolog. and the discovery of several glycolytic genes co-expressing with lipid-related genes suggested the close relationship between glycolysis and lipid biosynthesis.fig.  <dig> model of gene co-expression network in hickory embryo development. the line width indicates the correlation strength between  <dig> genes. the red line indicates the positive correlation, while the green line indicates the negative correlation. the gene in rectangle indicates lipid-related one. the unigene in magnified circle indicates the co-expressed candidate gene. the unigene in red solid circle indicates a putative transcription factor



CONCLUSIONS
the two-year concurrent global trancriptomic and lipidomic analyses conducted in this study provide a framework for better understanding of glycerolipid biosynthesis and metabolism in the oleaginous nut of hickory . the synthetical regulation of numerous leading lipid-related genes harmonized with the oil accumulation and fatty acid constituent conversion in hickory embryo development. the high transcriptional level of accase correlated positively with fatty acid de novo synthesis, the synergy of dgat <dig> and pdat promoted the tag assembly, and oleosins, caleosins and steroleosins were transcribed considerably high for timely energy reserve in oil body. the oil accumulation in developing hickory embryo relied prevailingly on the efficiency of fatty acid de novo synthesis instead of that of tag assembly except the last committed step of converting dag to tag. the perfect harmonization of the high level of sad with low level of fad <dig> facilitated the high content of oleic acid in hickory. and the ratio of fata/fatb or sad/fatb was proposed for determining the saturated degree of oil in plants. simultaneously, glycolysis possibly provided sufficient precursors concomitantly producing atp and nadph for lipid synthesis. the gene multi-copy event was generated probably for accommodating various survival environments. a thermotolerant defense system including tag hydrolysis determinants of sdp <dig> and pxa <dig>  heat shock proteins, transcription factors, and high ratio of mufa to pufa constrained the lipid degradation and provided a guarantee for high lipid content. moreover, a batch of potential lipid-related or thermo-inducing genes recruited from the genome-wide co-expression network helps us to understand the lipid synthesis and the response to high temperature better.
