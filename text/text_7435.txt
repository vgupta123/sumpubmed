BACKGROUND
traditionally and supported by 16s rrna gene and rnpb gene sequence analyses, the genus streptococcus is divided into several groups, with the mutans group streptococci consisting of the species s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. ratti, s. criceti, s. downei, s. macacae, and – but controversially discussed – s. ferus   <cit> . mutans streptococci are considered significant contributors to the development of dental caries  <cit> . by attaching to the tooth surfaces and forming biofilms, they can tolerate and adapt to the harsh and rapidly changing physiological conditions of the oral cavity such as extreme acidity, fluctuation of nutrients, reactive oxygen species, and other environmental stresses  <cit> . they occasionally also cause bacteremia, abscesses, and infective endocarditis  <cit> . many strains of mutans streptococci are genetically competent, i.e. they can take up dna fragments from the environment and recombine them into their chromosome, an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer . the ability of some bacteria to generate diversity through hgt provides a selective advantage to these microbes in their adaptation to host eco-niches and evasion of immune responses  <cit> . due to diversities in the genetic contents between different isolates, the genome content of a single isolate does not necessarily represent the genomic potential of a certain species. with the rapid development of dna sequencing technologies, the steadily increasing genome data enable us to dig the evolutionary and genetic information of a species from a pan-genome perspective. in  <dig>  the release of the genome sequence of s. mutans ua <dig>  the first genome sequence of mutans group streptococci, has greatly helped in understanding the robustness and complexity of s. mutans as an oral and odontogenic  pathogen  <cit> . later, after the genome sequence of s. mutans nn <dig> became available, a comparative genomic analysis of s. mutans nn <dig> and ua <dig> provides insights into chromosomal shuffling and species-specific contents  <cit> . recently, cornejo et al. have studied the evolutionary and population genomics of s. mutans based on  <dig> s. mutans draft genomes and revealed a high lateral gene transfer  rate of s. mutans <cit> .

in this study, we determined the whole genome sequences of six s. mutans strains , one s. ratti strain  and one s. sobrinus strain  and performed cross-comparison with the genome contents of s. mutans ua <dig> and nn <dig>  focusing on issues that are highly related to pathogenicity. the core- and pan-genome of s. mutans was analyzed by including  <dig> currently available s. mutans genome sequences. by constructing and comparing the genome-scale metabolic networks, the diversities in sub-networks  are systematically revealed. the results should be helpful for understanding the evolution and pathogenicity, as well as for prevention and treatment, of these very common opportunistic pathogens.

RESULTS
genome sequencing, assembly and annotation of eight mutans streptococci strains
as expected, the overall genomic features of the eight s. mutans strains are more close to each other than to s. ratti and s. sobrinus. this is consistent with the results of the phylogenetic analysis, as visualized by the phylogenetic tree constructed based on 16s rrna and core genes single-nucleotide polymorphisms  information shown in figure  <dig>  an overview of the genome assemblies and annotations of the  <dig> s. mutans isolates as well as s. ratti dsm  <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> is summarized in table  <dig> in comparison with two previously sequenced s. mutans strains, namely ua <dig> and s. mutans nn <dig>  the average gc contents are in the range of low gc organisms  <cit> . the genome sizes are very close to each other, with the largest one from s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> and the smallest one from s. mutans kk <dig> showing merely  <dig> % differences. the total numbers of protein-coding sequences per genome are also similar among all the strains compared.

chromosomal rearrangement of the s. mutans strains
genome rearrangements have important effects on bacterial phenotypes and the evolution of bacterial genomes  <cit> . a comparison of the genomes of s. mutans nn <dig> and ua <dig> discovered a large genomic inversion across the replication axis and similar genomic variations were also confirmed among  <dig> clinical s. mutans isolates using long-pcr analysis  <cit> . in this study, genome rearrangements among the eight s. mutans strains are determined by genome alignment using the mauve software  <cit> . the results are presented in figure  <dig>  which shows the locally collinear blocks  representing the landmarks, i.e. the homologous/conserved regions shared by all the input sequences in the chromosomes. a lcb is defined as a collinear  set of exactly matched subsequences  which are shared by all the chromosomes considered, appear once in each chromosome and are bordered on both sides by mismatched nucleotides. the weight  of a lcb serves as a measure of confidence that it is a true homologous region rather than a random match.

as shown in figure  <dig>   <dig> lcbs  are identified by multi-alignment of the eight s. mutans genome sequences. compared to ua <dig> and nn <dig>  the chromosome segment represented by lcb e is reversely inserted between the lcb g and h in the strain ac <dig>  and between the lcb l and m in the strain kk <dig>  this segment is related to the genomic island “smu.100-smu.116” of s. mutans ua <dig> which mainly contains sorbitol phosphotransferase system , transposase and hypothetical proteins  <cit> . lcb n is found to be reversed and relocated to the position between lcb a and b in the strain ac <dig>  a cluster of trna genes is found to be located downstream of lcb n. in kk <dig>  lcb i and j are moved to position between lcb f and g. a trna-gln and a trna-tyr is found to be adjacent to the left of lcb i. lcb k in nctc  <dig>  ac <dig>  kk <dig> and nn <dig> are very similar to each other but much smaller than those of other strains . the missing sequence corresponds to the genomic island tnsmu <dig> of s. mutans which harbors a nonribosomal peptide synthetase-polyketide synthase gene cluster responsible for the biosynthesis of pigments  <cit> . using the known information about genomic islands in s. mutans ua <dig>  additional genomic islands were found to be present/absent in the mutans streptococci strains of this study  <cit>  . furthermore, there are much more diversities as shown by the white areas inside the lcbs which show regions with low similarities. however, it should be noticed that there might be more genome rearrangements among the strains, because draft genome sequences are used in current analysis and all contigs in each genome are sorted according to the reference genome sequence of the strain ua <dig> 

core- and pan-genome analysis of s. mutans
the genetic variability within species in the domain bacteria is much larger than that found in other domains of life. the gene content between pairs of isolates can diverge by as much as 30% in species like streptococcus pneumoniae <cit> . this unexpected finding led to the introduction of the pan-genome concept, which describes the sum of genes that can be found in a given bacterial species  <cit> . the genome of any isolate is thus composed of a “core-genome” shared with all strains of this particular species, and a “dispensable genome” that accounts for the phenotypic differences between strains. the pan-genome is usually much larger than the genome of any single isolate, constituting a reservoir that could enhance the ability of many bacteria to survive in stressful environments. the pan-genome concept has important consequences for the way we understand bacterial evolution, adaptation, and population structure, as well as for more applied issues such as vaccine design or the identification of virulence genes  <cit> . in this study, we performed core-genome and pan-genome analyses of  <dig> s. mutans strains, including the eight s. mutans strains sequenced in this study and  <dig> s. mutans strains with genome available in ncbi till april  <dig> 

core-genome
the core-genome size of the  <dig> s. mutans strains was calculated to be  <dig> . detailed information of the core genes are provided in the additional file  <dig>  to estimate the theoretical core-genome size achievable with an infinite number of s. mutans genomes, core-genome size medians corresponding to different genome numbers as shown in figure 3a by the red rectangles were first calculated by random sampling  <dig>  genome combinations of n genomes out of the  <dig> s. mutans genomes. then, we applied the exponential regression core-genome model fcn=κcexp−nτc+Ω proposed previously by tettelin et al.  <cit>  to fit the median data points of the core-genome sizes, where kc, τc and Ω are parameters, n represents the number of genomes, and Ω stands for the theoretical core-genome size. to take into consideration the different deviations of the core-genome size medians, as clearly indicated by the blue error bars in figure 3a, we modified the fitting process by introducing the genome number as weight to the corresponding data point. the fitting parameters thus obtained are as follows: r2 =  <dig> , kc =  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,Ω =  <dig> .41225 ±  <dig> ,τc =  <dig>  ±  <dig>  . using this fitting result to describe the core-genome of s. mutans, the theoretical core-genome size  was estimated to be around  <dig>  genes, which is slightly lower than the calculated core-genome size  using  <dig> genomes. compared with other streptococcus species, the core-genome of s. mutans is at the same level to the core-genome of s. pyogenes , less than that of s. pneumoniae  and s. agalactiae   <cit> . however, we should be cautious with such comparison. in a recent study of cornejo et al.  <cit> , the core genome size of s. mutans was determined as  <dig>  by using  <dig> s. mutans genomes which is obviously different to the core genome size of s. mutans we estimated, although we included the  <dig> s. mutans genomes used by cornejo et al. in our study. the difference can be caused by different reasons, such as difference in the correction step for core gene determination and, very likely, different methods and parameter settings used for determining orthologs. apparently, we have used a more stringent process to determine orthologs which led to smaller core genome size of s. mutans estimated.

pan-genome
we applied three models, namely y = a + bxc, y = a − bln and y = a × e− x/b + c  for modeling the pan-genome of s. mutans, as shown in figure 3b by green, blue and red curves respectively . both the fitting results of using y = a + bxc and y = a − bln indicated an infinite pan-genome, while the fitting result of using y = a × e− x/b + c resulted in a negative value of the parameter a, suggesting a finite pan-genome however, the last fitting shows obvious deviations to many of the data points. especially, the deviations even become larger with increased genome numbers, indicating that this model is not suitable. the best fitting result obtained with the model y = a + bxc shows fittings to all the data points with very high confidence. based on this model, the pan-genome of s. mutans is still “open” while  <dig> genomes were included, and the expected average new gene number with the addition of a new genome is estimated to be  <dig>  the infinite pan-genome was first proposed by tettelin et al. for s. agalactiae based on the use of  <dig> s. agalactiae genomes. the three regression models used in this study are all based on the assumption that contingency genes are independently sampled from the pan-genome with equal probability, except in the case of “specific/unique genes”, which are modeled as unique events that appear only once in the entire global population. hogg et al.  <cit>  proposed a finite supragenome model for pan-genome based on a different supposition that contingency genes are sampled from the pan-genome with unequal probability. by applying this finite supragenome model to  <dig> s. pneumoniae genomes, the predicted number of new genes drops sharply to zero when the number of genomes exceeds  <dig>  however, in the case of s. mutans we could not observe such sharp decrease of new gene number even after  <dig> genomes were included. in the study of cornejo et al.  <cit> , they proposed a finite pan-genome for s. mutans, after they used a special “pseudogene cluster” identification process to exclude about 30% of the rare genes that are considered to be pseudogenes. however, they didn’t provide detailed parameters they obtained from fitting. our modeling using the  <dig> s. mutans genomes by applying the model described above without any restrictions pointed to an infinite pan-genome of s. mutans. however, we would like to understand this predicted “infinite” pan-genome as follows: 1) a “pan-genome” should be considered as “dynamic” rather than “static”, which means the pan-genome content is changing during the evolution, it does not matter if its size is infinite or finite; 2) the change of a pan-genome content can be caused by the acquirement of new genes or by the loss of genes; 3) the actual pan-genome size can be more stable than the content of the pan-genome but can also change during evolution coupled with the change of the environment. thus, without considering the “gene loss events”, it’s quite understandable to have a “growing” or “infinite” pan-genome as gene acquirement occurs no matter how slow it might be. interestingly, cornejo et al. found a high rate of lgt in s. mutans, where many genes were acquired from related streptococci and bacterial strains predominantly residing not only in the oral cavity, but also in the respiratory tract, the digestive tract, cattle, genitalia, in insect pathogens and in the environment in general  <cit> . such high rate of lgt might also lead to a continuously growing pan-genome.

gene content-based comparative analysis of  <dig> mutans streptococci strains
the annotated protein sequences of all the genomes studied were cross-compared based on alleles/ortholog groups established by the program orthomcl  <cit> . in total,  <dig>  putative alleles/ortholog groups are established, as documented in additional file  <dig>  a pair-wise comparison of the protein coding sequences between each two strains is shown in table  <dig>  it is clear to see that remarkable differences in protein coding sequences exist between the strains, even inside the same species of s. mutans. in the following sections, systems that are highly related to stress resistance and pathogenicity are presented and discussed. as all the following results are based on putative alleles/ortholog groups established by orthomcl, if not otherwise specified, the word “putative allele/ortholog” is omitted in the following text.

high diversities of the competence development regulation module
in a previous study we have systematically discussed the two-component signal transduction systems  in the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains  <cit> . comde, one of the tcsts is directly related to competence development. competence development is a complex process involving sophisticated regulatory networks that trigger the capacity of bacterial cells to take up exogenous dna from the environment. this phenomenon is frequently encountered in bacteria of the oral cavity, e.g., s. mutans <cit> . in s. mutans, comx, an alternative sigma factor, drives the transcription of the so called ‘late-competence genes’ required for genetic transformation. comx activity is modulated by the inputs from two types of signal pathways, namely the competence-stimulating peptide  dependent competence regulation system and csp-independent competence regulation system. comx and the ‘late-competence genes’ regulated by comx as labeled by boldface in table  <dig>  are highly conserved even between the species, indicating that all mutans streptococci studied here might have the potential ability of transforming to genetic competence state. on the other hand, the upstream signal pathways regulating the activity of comx show high variety as discussed in details below.

in the case that more than one paralogs were found, the most similar ortholog is marked in italic. the rows related to highly conserved ‘late-competence genes’ were shown in boldface. the missing of comde in s. ratti dsm  <dig> has been published in our previous study  <cit> .

csp-dependent competence regulation system
it has been reported that the comabcde system in s. mutans combines the action of the two ortholog systems which are present as comabcde and blpabcrh in s. pneumoniae and involved in competence regulation and bacteriocins regulation, respectively. it should be noticed that, comab have been primarily considered to be the transporter of comc, the precursor of csp. later, comab have been renamed as nlmte as they were found to function together as transporter of nonlantibiotic bacteriocins, while another gene pair cslab was supposed to be the transporter of comc  <cit> . however, a recent study confirms that comab is indeed a transporter both for nonlantibiotic bacteriocin and the peptide pheromone csp  <cit> .

in s. mutans, the comc-encoded prepeptide of csp has a leader sequence containing a conserved double glycine , at which the leader sequence is cleaved during transporting by comab to generate the mature signal peptide  containing  <dig> amino acid residues  <cit> . recent studies show that an extracellular protease, sepm , is involved in the further processing of csp- <dig> by removing the “lgk” residues in the c-terminal to generate a 18-residue peptide , which can work at a concentration much lower than that of csp- <dig>  <cit> . sepm is identified in all the  <dig> strains compared in this study, although putative comc alleles are present only in the eight s. mutans strains, not in the s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> and s. ratti dsm  <dig>  multi-alignment of the comc sequences shows clear variations among different s. mutans strains . genetic variation of comc in s. mutans has been reported previously  <cit> . interestingly, the c-terminal amino acid sequence “lgk” of comc is absent in the comc prepetides of s. mutans kk <dig> and ac <dig>  which have also been observed previously in other s. mutans strains by allan et al.  <cit> . atcc  <dig> possesses a unique comc sequence ended with “lgkir” at its c-terminal. in addition to the variations at the carboxyl end, substitutions of single amino acid residues at different positions are also found.

we have verified all the variants of comc revealed in this study by pcr experiments. although allan et al. pointed out that different comc alleles in some clinical strains of s. mutans exist but their products are functionally equivalent and there is no evidence of phenotype specificity  <cit> , considering the complexity of phenotype evaluation, whether and how the variations found in this study may affect the natural genetic competence of these s. mutans strains requires further investigation.

the csp-initiated activation of the response regulator come, through its cognate receptor kinase comd, leads to the induction of competence through the alternative sigma factor comx, and at the same time come directly induces a set of bacteriocin-related genes  <cit> . in our previous study focused on the comparison of the two-component signal transduction systems of these mutans streptococci strains, we have reported the complete missing of comde in s. ratti dsm  <dig> and the low similarities of putative comde in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> to the comde of s. mutans strains  <cit> . accordingly, no comc-like genes could be identified in s. ratti dsm  <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  thus, it can be inferred that s. ratti dsm  <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> are totally different to the s. mutans strains regarding cellular functions including genetic competence associated with the comabcde system.

in s. mutans, no binding motif for come is present in the promoter region of comx, suggesting that come is not a direct regulator of comx, whereas a new peptide regulator system  downstream of come that directly activates comx has been identified by mashburn-warren et al. comr activates the expression of the coms, which is secreted, processed, and internalized through the peptide transporter oppd. the processed peptide, designated xip , modulates the activity of comr, which in turn activates the expression of comx. deletion of comr or coms gene completely abolished the competence in s. mutans <cit> . in this study, the comsr regulating system is identified in most of the strains, except for s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> which lacks the comsr-coding genes. this well explains the fact that despite the presence of comx and the ‘late-competence genes’ we were not able to obtain the genetic competence state of s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> . it is also worth to mention that the putative coms ortholog found in s. ratti dsm  <dig> is quite different to those of s. mutans strains, as shown in figure 4b.

csp-independent competence regulation system
it has been reported that a basal level of competence remains  after the deletion of come from s. mutans, suggesting that the csp-dependent regulation system is one of the several signaling pathways involved in comx activation  <cit> . indeed, under conditions of biofilm growth the hdrmr system, a novel two-gene regulatory system, has been shown to contribute to competence development through the activation of comx by a yet unknown signal  <cit> . moreover, microarray analysis revealed that both regulators, come and hdrr, activate a large set of overlapping genes  <cit> . recently, xie et al. identified in s. mutans another regulatory system, designated bsrrm, that primarily regulates bacteriocin-related genes but also affects the hdrmr system and thus indirectly contributes to competence development  <cit> . in this study, hdrr, the response regulator of the hdrmr system, is found neither present in s. ratti dsm  <dig> nor in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  furthermore, the response regulator brsr of the bsrrm system is also absent in s. ratti dsm  <dig>  whereas s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> lacks the complete bsrrm system. it’s also worth to mention that a competence damage-inducible protein cina, which is regulated via comx and has been proven to be related to dna damage, genetic transformation and cell survival  <cit> , is present in all strains.

taking together, both the csp-dependent and csp-independent competence regulation systems in s. ratti dsm  <dig> and especially in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> are very different to those of the s. mutans strains.

distribution of bacteriocin-related proteins and antibiotic resistance-related proteins
bacteriocin-related proteins
bacteriocins are proteinaceous toxins produced by bacteria to kill or inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain. bacteriocins produced by mutans streptococci are named “mutacins”. as dental plaque, the dominating niche of mutans streptococci, is a multispecies biofilm community that harbors many microorganism species, mutans group strains have developed a variety of mutacins to inhibit the growth of competitors, such as mitis group streptococci  <cit> . in this study, information about known mutacins as well as mutacin-immunity proteins was collected from the ncbi  and oralgen  databases, as well as by searching for related publications. the collected protein sequences, as listed in additional file  <dig>  were used to blast against the proteomes of the  <dig> strains to see whether or not these known mutacins and mutacin-immunity proteins do exist in the mutans streptococci strains of this study. distributions of identified mutacins and mutacin-immunity proteins are summarized in table  <dig>  using this approach it is, however, not possible to identify any new types of mutacins.

in the case that more than one paralogs were found, the most similar ortholog is marked in bold font.

note: as a multi-function exporter, the entries of nlmte have been shown in table  <dig> and here again.

diversity of streptococcus bacteriocins has been reported previously  <cit> . the mutacin assortments among the  <dig> strains in this study also demonstrate certain variations. an interesting result is that in contrast to s. mutans strains and s. ratti dsm  <dig>  s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> does not possess any genes coding for mutacin-like proteins. mutacin-smb has been identified in s. mutans and s. ratti previously  <cit> . in our study, mutacin-smb cluster was only identified in s. ratti dsm  <dig> comprising  <dig> genes, including the mutacin-coding genes smba and smbb, as well as  <dig> mutacin-related genes . lantibiotic mutacins, mutacin-i  <cit> , mutacin-ii  <cit>  and mutacin-iii  <cit> , are completely absent in the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains. however, three gene copies possibly encoding the precursor of the lantibiotic mutancin mutacin-k <dig> are identified in the s. mutans strains kk <dig> and nn <dig>  mutacin-k <dig> is an ortholog of the bacteriocin streptococcin a-ff <dig> identified in group-a streptococci  <cit> , and its production system has previously also been identified in the s. mutans strain k <dig>  <cit> . by carefully examining the genes surrounding mutacin-k <dig> precursor genes the gene cluster coding for a complete mutacin-k <dig> production system is also revealed in the strains kk <dig> and nn <dig> . a partial ortholog of the mutacin-k <dig> production system is found in s. mutans ua <dig>  5dc <dig> and kk <dig>  with only genes responsible for the immunity  left behind. orthologous genes coding for a part of the mutacin-k <dig> production system are also found in s. mutans ac <dig>  consisting of only scnfeg, scnt  and a part of scnm . since a gene encoding issmu2-type transposase is found to be located upstream of mutacin-k <dig> precursor genes, we infer that the variety of mutacin-k <dig> production system in s. mutans strains studied here is highly possible to be caused by transposase actions.

mutacin-iv, nonlantibiotic bacteriocins coded by nlma/b  was discovered first in s. mutans ua <dig> to be active against the mitis group streptococci  <cit> . in this study, nlma/b are found to be present in six of the s. mutans strains, including ua <dig>  5dc <dig>  kk <dig>  kk <dig>  atcc  <dig> and nctc  <dig>  but not in s. mutans nn <dig> and ac <dig>  nor in s. ratti dsm  <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  on the other hand, the immunity protein for mutacin-iv , is identified in all strains, consistent with the fact that no inhibition phenomenon has been observed yet among different mutans streptococci strains. a mutacin-iv like protein found before in the strain ua <dig>  is identified in all strains except for s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> 

mutacin-v, another nonlantibiotic peptide coded by cipb  is found, in addition to s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  also absent in the s. mutans strains atcc  <dig> and nctc  <dig>  there are two homologs of mutacin-v immunity protein in s. mutans ua <dig>  namely cipi  and smu. <dig>  <cit> . these two immunity proteins share a sequence identity of 82%. however, it has been reported that though very likely co-transcribed with cipb, smu. <dig> cannot prevent cipb-caused cell lysis in s. mutans ua <dig>  and the key immunity factor of mutacin-v has been supposed to be cipi  rather than smu. <dig>  <cit> . all the  <dig> strains including s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> possess at least one orthologous gene encoding one of the two mutacin-v immunity proteins. based on the similarity scores s. mutans nn <dig> does not have an ortholog of cipi , but it possesses an ortholog  of smu. <dig>  which is possibly co-transcribed with gi| <dig>  the cipb ortholog in s. mutans nn <dig>  furthermore, the only putative immunity protein d822_ <dig> in s. ratti dsm  <dig> shows very close similarities to smu. <dig>  and smu. <dig>  and is possibly co-transcribed with d822_ <dig>  the cipb ortholog in s. ratti dsm  <dig>  from these results, we suppose that smu. <dig>  which is co-transcribed with cipb , might be the ancestor gene coding for the mutacin-v immunity factor. the additional copy, like smu. <dig> in s. mutans ua <dig>  might be generated by duplication action and evolved as the dominant immunity factor in some of the mutans streptococci strains.

furthermore, a possible nonlantibiotic bacteriocin peptide  is found to be present in all strains except for s. ratti dsm  <dig>  putative comab, which has been proved to be the transporter complex of mutacin iv in s. mutans <cit> , are identified in all strains, supporting the suggestion that comab might function as a common transporter for multi-type nonlantibiotic bacteriocins rather than merely for mutacin iv. moreover, an additional paralog of coma is present in most of the strains except for s. mutans kk <dig> and s. mutans atcc  <dig> 

to summarize, a differed distribution of mutacin/bacteriocin encoding genes accompanied with a high conservation of genes coding for mutacin-immunity proteins are revealed for the  <dig> mutans streptococci strains/species. the conservation of mutacin immunity proteins apparently plays an important role for the survival of mutans streptococci strains under a bacteriocin-rich environment.

antibiotic resistance-related proteins
bacteria and other microorganisms that cause infections are remarkably resilient and can develop ways to survive drugs meant to kill or weaken them. antibiotic resistance can be a result of horizontal gene transfer  <cit> , and also of unlinked point mutations in the pathogen genome at a rate of about  <dig> in  <dig> per chromosomal replication  <cit> . the antibiotic action against the pathogen can be seen as an environmental selective pressure and bacteria which have developed mutations allowing them to survive will live on to reproduce. they will then pass this trait to their offsprings, which will result in the evolution of fully resistant colonies. putative resistance-related genes are identified and listed in table  <dig> 

the s. mutans species is known to be intrinsically resistant to bacitracins produced by bacillus subtilis. we confirmed this by testing all the  <dig> strains with a bacitracin-e-test . all strains including s. ratti dsm  <dig> and s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> had a minimum inhibitory concentration between  <dig> and > <dig> μg/l. in fact, this antibiotic is used to isolate mutans-streptococci from highly heterogeneous oral microflora. it has been reported that bceabrs  system, encoding a two component signal transduction system and an abc-transporter, is required for bacitracin resistance in s. mutans <cit> . as expected, ortholog of bceabrs system is found to be present in all strains. furthermore, an ortholog of a putative bacitracin resistance protein uppp  is present in all strains. it has been proved that overexpression of uppp in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis results in bacitracin resistance  <cit> . however, the function of uppp in bacitracin resistance in mutans streptococci has not yet been investigated. based on its conservation in all strains studied here, we suppose that uppp might play an important role in bacitracin resistance for mutans streptococci species as well.

two penicillin-binding proteins  are identified in all strains, indicating that they are potentially all susceptible to penicillin. phenotypically all strains were tested to be susceptible to penicillin . on the other hand, all the strains possess orthologs of smu.368c, smu. <dig>  smu.1444c and smu. <dig>  which are homologs to beta-lactamases , as well as orthologs of two so called beta-lactam resistance factors . thus, all the strains are potentially capable of resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics. orthologs of macrolide-efflux transporter proteins, as coded by gi| <dig> and gi| <dig> in s. mutans nn <dig>  are found to be also present in s. mutans 5dc <dig> and s. mutans kk <dig>  a vancomycin b-type resistance-associated protein  is uniquely present in s. ratti dsm  <dig>  but our phenotypic testing showed as expected that s. ratti dsm  <dig> is susceptible to vancomycin. furthermore, several putative multidrug resistance-associated proteins  are found to be present in all strains.

oxidative stress defense systems in mutans streptococci
for protection against reactive oxygen species  or adaptation to oxidative stresses aerobes and facultative anaerobes have evolved efficient defense systems, comprising an array of antioxidant enzymes such as catalase, superoxide dismutase , dps-like peroxide resistance protein, alkylhydroperoxide reductase , glutathione reductase, and thiol reductase, which have been identified in many bacterial species.

although the first genome sequence of s. mutans ua <dig> has already been published in  <dig>  the oxidative stress defense systems in the group of mutans streptococci have not yet been systematically discussed. by searching for known antioxidant systems in the genomes of the sequenced mutans streptococci strains of this study, we obtained an overview of putative oxidative defense systems in these mutans streptococci strains/species which are composed of superoxide dismutase , ahpf/ahpc system, dpr, thioredoxin system and glutaredoxin system, as shown in table  <dig> 

sod, which catalyzes the dismutation of superoxide into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide, is an important antioxidant defense in nearly all cells exposed to oxygen  <cit> . sod is found in all strains of this study. catalase, which catalyzes the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, is not found in any of the mutans streptococci strains of this study. it is known that although most streptococci can grow in the presence of air, they do not possess a catalase, implying that hydrogen peroxide defense mechanism, by which lactic acid bacteria established their growth in air, are very different to those of aerobes. it has been reported that both the bi-component peroxidase system ahpf/ahpc and dps-like peroxide resistance protein confer tolerance to oxidative stress in s. mutans <cit> .

the ahpf/ahpc system catalyzes the nadh-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides and/or h2o <dig> to their respective alcohol and/or h2o. both ahpf and ahpc are present in all s. mutans strains of this study and in s. ratti dsm  <dig>  but are absent in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  the natural missing of ahpf and ahpc in s. sobrinus indicates that ahpf/ahpc system is not an essential peroxide tolerance system for some mutans streptococci species. while studying a ahpf and ahpc double deletion mutant of s. mutans, higuchi et al.  <cit>  found that the mutant still showed the same level of peroxide tolerance as did the wild-type strain that led them to the finding of the dpr gene, which encodes a ferritin-like iron-binding protein involved in oxygen tolerance by limiting the nonenzymatic hydroxyl radical synthesis via iron-catalyzed ‘fenton reaction’ in s. mutans. their further studies on the biological function of dpr found that dpr gene from s. mutans chromosome was capable of complementing an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase-deficient mutant of e. coli, as well as complementing the defect in peroxidase activity caused by the deletion of ahpf/ahpc in s. mutans, indicating that dpr plays an indispensable role in oxygen tolerance of s. mutans <cit> . dpr homologs were found in all strains as expected by the supposed essential function of dpr gene in oxygen tolerance.

thioredoxins are a class of small redox mediator proteins known to be present in all organisms. they are involved in many important biological processes, including redox signaling. thioredoxins are kept in the reduced state by the flavor enzyme thioredoxin reductase in a nadph-dependent reaction  <cit> . they act as electron donors to many proteins including thiol peroxidases  <cit> . thioredoxin, thioredoxin reductase and thiol peroxidase, the components of thioredoxin system, are identified in all the strains of this study. two putative thioredoxin reductases  are found in all strains/species. it has been reported that in some species thioredoxin reductases have been evolved to be activated by both nadph and nadh  <cit> . we speculate that smu. <dig> and smu. <dig> might have been evolved to have different preferences to nadph and nadh . if it holds true, this could be advantageous for these mutans streptococci, as the extra amount of nadh produced from glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway under anaerobic conditions could be directly used for oxidative stress resistance. thioredoxin  and two thioredoxin family proteins  are found to be present in nearly all strains, except for s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  which lacks any ortholog of smu1169c. an ortholog of a thiol peroxidase-coding gene  is identified in all strains.

glutaredoxins share many functions of thioredoxins but are reduced by glutathione  rather than by a specific reductase. this means that glutaredoxins are oxidized by their corresponding substrates, and reduced non-enzymatically by gsh  <cit> . oxidized glutathione  is then regenerated by glutathione reductase. together, these components comprise the glutathione system  <cit> . gsh is a well-characterized antioxidant in eukaryotes and gram-negative bacteria, where it is synthesized by the sequential action of two enzymes, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase  and glutathione synthetase . among gram-positive bacteria only a few species contain gsh. it has been reported that streptococci lack the moderate-to-high levels of intracellular glutathione normally found in gram-negative bacteria  <cit> . using streptococcus agalactiae as a model, it has been discovered that in gsh-containing gram-positive bacteria gsh synthesis is catalyzed by one bifunctional protein, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase-glutathione synthetase , encoded by one gene, gshab. homologs of γ-gcs-gs have been identified in the genomes of  <dig> mostly studied gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans <cit> . all components of the glutathione system were identified in all the  <dig> strains of this study. several s. mutans strains, namely ua <dig>  5dc <dig>  kk <dig>  kk <dig>  atcc  <dig>  and nctc  <dig>  as well as s. ratti dsm  <dig>  possess two glutathione reductase orthologs . this could possibly convey these strains certain advantages in the re-generation of gsh from gssg, which in turn would be helpful for oxidative resistance.

in addition, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate phosphatase activity has recently been reported to be required for superoxide stress tolerance in s. mutans <cit> . putative 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphate phosphatase coding genes were identified in all strains .

variability and specificity in metabolic pathways and network
in order to reveal the metabolic variability of the mutans streptococci systematically, we have reconstructed and analyzed the genome-scale metabolic networks of all the strains sequenced with the method proposed by ma and zeng  <cit>  and an updated database  <cit> . all annotated protein sequences having ec numbers are considered for the network reconstruction. from the functional annotation discussed above, total ec numbers identified in the  <dig> strains are very close to each other, as shown in table  <dig>  a summary of the total numbers of the reactions and metabolites in each of the reconstructed metabolic networks is shown in table  <dig>  and all the constructed metabolic networks are provided in additional file  <dig> in *.cys format which can be opened with cytoscape  <cit> , a software for visualization and analysis of biological networks. the sizes of the constructed metabolic networks of the eight s. mutans strains are very close to each other, with ua <dig>  nn <dig>  ac <dig>  5dc <dig> and kk <dig> having almost exactly the same size, and the networks of kk <dig>  atcc  <dig> and nctc  <dig> being merely about 2% larger. while the size of the metabolic network of s. ratti dsm  <dig> is comparable to those of the s. mutans strains, the metabolic network of s. sobrinus with  <dig> reactions and  <dig> metabolites is the smallest one, which have  <dig> less reactions and  <dig> less metabolites compared to the largest one of s. mutans nctc  <dig> .

despite the comparable network sizes, however, all the strains possess or lack certain reactions/metabolites, as revealed by detailed comparative analyses. using the metabolic network of s. mutans ua <dig> as reference, the presence and absence of reactions in each of the strains/species compared are discovered and mapped into sub-pathways based on the kegg pathway classification . as a result, among the  <dig> sub-pathways defined in the kegg pathway database  <dig> sub-pathways demonstrated certain variations between the strains/species, as summarized in additional file  <dig> 

a key feature of the oral environment is that the nutrients available to the oral bacteria are always fluctuating between abundance and famine associated with human diet. thus, the ability to quickly acquire and metabolize carbohydrates to produce energy and precursors for biosynthesis is essential for the survival of all oral bacteria. due to their key roles in carbohydrates metabolism and energy production, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, tca cycle and pyruvate metabolism pathways are generally considered to be highly conserved among these oral bacteria. although mutans streptococci strains/species are closely related species as revealed by phylogenetic tree analysis in this study , differences in the central carbon metabolic pathways are found as shown in figure  <dig> 

facultative anaerobes such as lactic acid bacteria including streptococcus lack cytochrome oxidases required for energy-linked oxygen metabolism and energy  required for survival and growth are generated by substrate level phosphorylation in the glycolysis pathway  <cit> . l-lactate oxidase  with a similarity of 73% to yp_ <dig>   of lactobacillus plantarum jdm <dig> and lactate oxidase  with a similarity of 65% to zp_ <dig>   of lactobacillus mali kctc  <dig>  are found to be uniquely present in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  these two enzymes catalyze the reaction of l-lactate + o2= > pyruvate + h2o <dig> and/or d-lactate + o2= > pyruvate + h2o <dig>  it has been reported that in s. pneumoniae concerted action of lactate oxidase and pyruvate oxidase forms a novel energy-generation pathway by converting lactate acid to acetic acid under aerobic growth conditions  <cit> . because there is no pyruvate oxidase identified in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  the function of the lactate oxidases in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> should be different to that of s. pneumoniae. by a close examination we hypothesize that lactate oxidase, together with pyruvate dehydrogenase, phosphate acetyl transferase and acetate kinase, could form a novel energy production pathway to convert lactate acid to acetate and simultaneously produce one additional atp, as depicted figure  <dig>  by doing so, the lactate oxidases of s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> could also play a role in consuming lactate to regulate ph, which would be an advantage for s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> in resistance to acid stress. in addition, this pathway could replenish acetyl-coa, an important intermediate for the biosynthesis of fatty acids and amino acids. this is for the first time that such an energy production pathway is proposed in streptococcus species. furthermore, lactate oxidase and lactate dehydrogenase could form a local nad+ regeneration system, which would be certainly advantageous to s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> under aerobic growth conditions. moreover, it is known that mutans group streptococci and the mitis group streptococci are competitors, with s. mutans producing mutacins to kill the mitis group streptococci and the mitis group streptococci in turn produce h2o <dig> to kill mutans group streptococci  <cit> . favored by possessing the lactate oxidases, s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> has the potential ability of producing h2o <dig> to kill not only competitors  but also macrophages  <cit> , and defend its ecological niche. the unique presence of lactate oxidases in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> was verified by pcr experiments as shown in additional file  <dig>  later, we also found that another s. sobrinus strain ac <dig> also harbors homologous genes of lactate oxidase, suggesting that lactate oxidase may be conserved and play an important role in s. sobrinus. in the effort to clarify the functionality of lactate oxidase we tried to knock out the two genes encoding the two enzymes by pcr ligation mutagenesis according to the method of lau pc et al. . we applied different transformation methods  but were failed to obtain the desired recombinants. then, to find out if s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> is able to enter genetic competence state at all, we tried to transform s. sobrinus with plasmids replicative in other streptococcus spp. like pdl <dig> , which catalyzes the cleavage of citrate into oxaloacetate and acetate, and oxaloacetate decarboxylase , catalyzing the irreversible decarboxylation of oxaloacetate to pyruvate and co <dig>  are not found in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  as shown in figure  <dig> by the blue dotted lines. it has been reported that citrate lyase functions as a key enzyme in initiating the anaerobic utilization of citrate by a number of bacteria, further catabolism of oxaloacetate formed taking place either by decarboxylation or by reduction. in some organisms, oxaloacetate is decarboxylated to pyruvate by oxaloacetate decarboxylase, which is also induced in the presence of citrate. the two enzymatic reactions, which occur sequentially, constitute the ‘citrate fermentation pathway’  <cit> . the absence of citrate lyase and oxaloacetate decarboxylase implies that s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> might lacks the ability in anaerobic utilization of citrate as a substrate. the disadvantages of s. sobrinus dsm  <dig> in citrate utilization could be offset by the novel energy production pathway from lactate to acetate proposed above.

a putative pyruvate-phosphate dikinase , which catalyzes the interconversion between pep and pyruvate, is found to be uniquely present in s. ratti dsm  <dig>  pyruvate-phosphate dikinase has been found in propionic acid bacteria  <cit> . the large difference in the standard free energy of hydrolysis for atp to amp and pyrophosphate  and for pep to pyruvate  at ph  <dig>  indicates that the equilibrium for the reaction it catalyzes would strongly favor pyruvate formation. but studies in acetobacter xylinum clearly indicate that the function of this enzyme under physiological conditions favors the process of gluconeogenesis  <cit> . metabolite interconversion at the pep-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node involves a structurally entangled set of reactions that interconnect the major pathways of carbon metabolism and thus, is responsible for the distribution of the carbon flux among catabolism, anabolism and energy supply of the cell  <cit> . under glycolytic conditions oxaloacetate is generated by carboxylation of pep and/or pyruvate catalyzed by pep carboxylase  and/or pyruvate carboxylase . in this study pcx is not found in any of the mutans streptococci strains.

all the  <dig> strains of this study possess similarly an incomplete tca cycle and the primary role of the existing tca enzymes is most likely the synthesis of amino acid precursors as has been reported previously  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
in the present study, the genomes of  <dig> mutans streptococci strains, including six s. mutans strains, one s. ratti strain and one s. sobrinus strain were sequenced, annotated and compared together with s. mutans ua <dig> and nn <dig>  multiple genome alignment showed extensive genome rearrangement among the eight strains of s. mutans. the core-genome size of s. mutans was determined to be around  <dig>  genes by including  <dig> s. mutans genomes. a possibly open pan-genome of s. mutans was inferred.

systematic comparative analyses were focused on competence regulation, bacteriocin  production, antibiotic resistance, oxidative stress resistance, as well as central carbon metabolism and energy production pathways. most of these systems show remarkable differences between the strains, except for oxidative stress resistance systems which are found to be well conserved. csp-dependent and independent competence regulation systems are highly diverse in mutans streptococci: no comc-like genes could be identified in s. ratti and s. sobrinus; putative comc amino acid sequences of s. mutans show clear variations; coms and comr are absent in s. sobrinus which well explains the fact that we were not able obtain genetic competence state of s. sobrinus by experiment, even though the comx and the downstream competence development genes are well reserved; furthermore, the response regulators of the hdrmr and bsrrm systems, which are known to be involved in competence development, are missing in both s. ratti and s. sobrinus.

variation in mutacin-encoding genes is accompanied with the conservation of mutacin immunity proteins, which indicates apparently important roles of the mutacin immunity proteins for the survival of these mutans streptococci in a bacteriocin rich environment. the presence of various antibiotic resistance factors, together with the open pan-genome inferred, implies that attention should be paid to the potential of mutans streptococci in the development of antibiotic resistance.

the sizes of the genome-scale metabolic networks of the  <dig> strains are very close to each other. comparative analysis of sub-pathways reveals that  <dig> sub-pathways of all  <dig> sub-pathways defined in kegg pathway database show variation using s. mutans ua <dig> as reference. by identifying lactate oxidases to be uniquely present in s. sobrinus dsm  <dig>  we proposed for the first time a novel energy production pathway in s. sobrinus. additional functions of the lactate oxidases in connection with the proposed energy production pathway are also discussed.

in conclusion, the genomes of mutans streptococci display remarkable differences, especially among different species. we believe that the strain-specific information provided in this study should be helpful to understand the evolution and adaptive mechanisms of those oral pathogens.
