BACKGROUND
severe acute respiratory syndrome  emerged as a communicable human disease in november  <dig> and rapidly spread throughout the world  <cit> . a coronavirus, called sars-associated coronavirus , was identified as the causative agent  <cit> . sars-cov is a plus-strand rna virus featuring a large single-stranded rna genome of approximately  <dig>  kb  <cit>  that contains  <dig> non-structural proteins  with multiple enzymatic functions. these are known or are predicted to include types of enzymes that are common components of the replication machinery of plus-strand rna viruses  <cit> . in these nsps, the nsp <dig>  is responsible for the proteolytic processing of viral polypeptides into functional proteins and 3clpro mutant, c145a, blocks the maturation process  <cit> . this viral protease has been the target for design of the inhibitors  <cit> . recently, sars-3clpro was found to induce cell apotosis and interact with cellular vacuolar-h+ atpase  <cit> . several human proteins might possess a similar structure of sars-3clpro cleavage sites using computational methods  <cit> . theses studies implied the sars-3clpro could involve in virus-induced host pathology.

sars-cov causes a severe lung infection, and the epithelial cells of the upper respiratory tract are the primary targets  <cit> . sars-cov reproduces rapidly and causes massive cell damage. at the whole-body level, immune-mediated damage, due to activation of cytokines and/or chemokines  <cit>  and, perhaps, autoimmunity  <cit> , may play key roles in the clinical and pathological features of sars. one of the major causes of host death is the induction of lung fibrosis. the mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by sars-cov requires elucidation. significant efforts have been made to analyze the function of sars-3clpro on viral replication, but the impact of sars-3clpro on cytokines of the host cell is still unclear. in this study, we constructed the pegfp-c <dig> vector with sars-3clpro gene and transfected it into a <dig> lung epithelial cells. the expression profiles of cytokines were validated by rt-pcr and elisa. the results indicated that the expression and secretion of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor  decrease in sars-3clpro transfected a <dig> cells. furthermore, nf-kb, putative regulators of gm-csf gene expression, was also decreased on its protein level in 3clpro transfected cells.

RESULTS
construction of sars-cov 3clpro wild type and a mutant c145a clone into pegfp-c <dig> vector
to optimize the efficiency of transfection and expression of functional 3clpro in a <dig> lung cancer cell line, we constructed expression vector expressing sars-cov 3clpro wild type gene into a pegfp-c <dig> vector . an inactive 3clpro mutant, c145a , was also included in this study as a negative control  <cit> . furthermore, the myc tag sequence was also introduced into the 3' end of the 3clpro and c145a genes for immunofluorescence analysis. the dna fragments of cmv promoter, 3clpro wild type, and c145a 3clpro mutant were amplified by pcr using primers containing restriction enzyme sites as shown in figure 1a. the expression constructs were further verified by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis after restriction enzymes digestion . as expected, the  <dig> bp of pcmv and  <dig> bp of 3clpro  fragments were excised from plasmids with appropriate restriction enzymes and were confirmed by dna sequencing.

expression of egfp, 3clpro, and c145a in a <dig> cells
the plasmids of pegfp-c <dig>  pegfp-3clpro, and pegfp-c145a were successfully transfected into a <dig> cells respectively. the expression levels of 3clpro and c145a mrna were determined by reverse transcription -pcr and the protein expression levels were analyzed using 2d western blots . the results indicated that the expression of 3clpro and c145a mrna reached the highest level in a <dig> cells at  <dig> to  <dig> hrs and slightly decreased their expression at  <dig> h after transfection. however, 2d western blots results indicated that the protein expression levels of 3clpro and c145a steadily increased with time up to  <dig> hrs after transfection. to track the locations of 3clpro and c145a proteins in transfected a <dig> cells, myc-tagged 3clpro and c145a were detected using rhodamine-conjugated anti-myc antibodies. the immunofluorescence microscopic images demonstrated 60-70% transfection efficiency  and the localizations of c-myc tagged 3clpro and c145a were detected both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of transfected a <dig> cells compared to control egfp .

the expression of gm-csf in sars-3clpro transfected a <dig> cells by semi-quantification rt-mpcr
total rna from a <dig> cells , egfp  and pegfp-3clpro  transfected cells were collected at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs. as shown in figure  <dig>  expression of gm-csf was demonstrated in 3clpro transfected cells, a <dig> cells and egfp transfected cells  by multiplex pcr kits. the decreased percentage was observed in egfp-3clpro transfected a <dig> cells compared to the egfp transfected a <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs is 9%, 17%, 25%, 49%, and 56%, respectively. there was significant decrease of gm-csf in 3clpro transfected a <dig> cells after  <dig> hrs . additionally, there were no change to the mrna expression of il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il12p <dig>  tnf-α, and tgf-β found in 3clpro transfected cells. to confirm the mrna expression of gm-csf, other primer pairs were used to amplify gm-csf by semi-quantification rt-mpcr. as shown in figure 4b, decreased expression of gm-csf was noted in 3clpro transfected cells compared to gapdh in a <dig> cells and egfp transfected cells at  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs. a significant decrease of gm-csf was observed in 3clpro transfected a <dig> cells after  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs with maximal reduction folds of vector control about  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively .

the secretion of gm-csf in sars-3clpro transfected a <dig> cells by elisa
as shown in figure  <dig>  the values of gm-csf concentration in the culture mediums of egfp transfected a <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±. <dig> ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  , respectively. the values of gm-csf concentration in the culture mediums of 3clpro transfected a <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  , respectively. the values of gm-csf concentration in the culture mediums of c145a transfected a <dig> cells at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> hrs were  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±  <dig> ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  ,  <dig>  ±. <dig>  , respectively. a significant decrease of gm-csf was observed in 3clpro transfected a <dig> cells compared to the egfp-transfected and c145a-transfected a <dig> cells by an analysis of covariance .

involvement of nf-κb in 3clpro-mediated gm-csf expression in a <dig> cells
to investigate whether erk1/ <dig>  p <dig>  and jnk mapk pathways and nf-κb were involved in 3clpro-mediated gm-csf production in a <dig> cells  <cit> , we examined the expression levels of these map kinases and nf-κb by western blot analysis. as shown in figure  <dig> , the expression of nf-κb was reduced in 3clpro transfected cells at  <dig> hrs after transfection compared to cells transfected with egfp. in contrast, over expression of 3clpro did not change the expression levels of erk1/ <dig>  p <dig>  and jnk in a <dig> cells significantly.

discussion
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  causes a severe lung infection  <cit> . it is important to elucidate the mechanism of the lung fibrosis caused by sars-cov. the expression of 3clpro and c145a in a <dig> cells was established  to elucidate the pathogenesis of sars-cov in lung epithelial cells. the localization patterns of 3clpro and c145a were observed both in the cytoplasm and nucleus of a <dig> cells by immunofluorescence . decreased expression and levels of gm-csf were found in 3clpro-transfected cells using rt-pcr, but not in c145a transfected cells . down-regulation of gm-csf expression by 3clpro in a <dig> cells may be attributed in part to the reduced protein level of nf-kb . in addition, there were no significant decreases in the mrna expression of il-1β, il- <dig>  il- <dig>  il12p <dig>  tnf-α, tgf-β using rt-mpcr. this finding is consistent with that of ziegler et al  <cit>  who reported no induction of cytokines genes  or ifn-α/β-induced mxa gene in sars-cov-infected a <dig> cells.

gm-csf was originally defined by its ability to generate in vitro granulocyte and macrophage colonies from bone marrow precursor cells  <cit> . apart from its physiological role in the control of alveolar macrophage development, it now appears more likely that its major role lies in its ability to govern the properties of the more mature myeloid cells of the granulocyte and macrophage lineages, particularly during host defense and inflammatory reactions. recent evidence for the key role of gm-csf in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases is summarized  <cit> . gm-csf-deficient mice showed an increased susceptibility to pulmonary infections  <cit> . in addition, some studies also demonstrated that impaired production of gm-csf played a role in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis  <cit> . together, there is growing evidence suggesting that gm-csf is an important regulator of the alveolar epithelium, surfactant homeostasis, and lung host defense  <cit> . to support the above, our experimental results show decreased expression and secretion of gm-csf in 3clpro-transfected cells, and suggest that sars-3clpro will affect host defense.

due to the functional importance of sars-cov 3clpro in proteolytic recognition and processing of the virus polyproteins, the experimental approaches and computational prediction of substrate cleavage sites of 3clpro become attractive topics in anti-sars drug design  <cit> . it is clear that the 3clpro cleavage sites are consistent preferentially with relative position of p1'-ser/ala p1-gln p2-leu  <cit> . in this study, 3clpro transfected a <dig> cells decreased the protein levels of nf-kb with subsequent decline in gm-csf mrna and protein expression . the amino acid sequence analyses of nf-kb indicated that non-canonical 3clpro cleavage sites  commonly existed in nf-kb. interestingly, nf-kb are associated in gm-csf production in lung cancer cell lines  <cit> . in depth investigations are required to determine whether 3clpro directly or indirectly affects the protein levels of nf-kb in transfected a <dig> cell.

CONCLUSIONS
the role of the viral cytopathic effect in the pathogenesis of sars-cov-associated lung diseases involvement remains unclear. our results reveals that the 3clpro -induced decreased gm-csf herein may provide further information on the pathogenesis of lung diseases with associated sars-cov. also, the protein levels of nf-kb decreased in 3clpro transfected cells. thus, we conclude that 3clpro may mediate down-regulation of nf-kb production and subsequently suppress gm-csf mrna and protein expression in transfected a <dig> cells. therefore, the sars-cov 3clpro may play a role in the mechanism of lung fibrosis of sars through the suppression of gm-csf.
