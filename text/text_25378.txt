BACKGROUND
the majority of human copy number variants  are simple di-allelic polymorphisms, generally involving variable deletion of non-coding sequences. however, a small but interesting subgroup of cnvs displays multi-allelic polymorphism for the copy number of a gene or cluster of genes. examples include polymorphism for the copy number of ccl3l <dig> and ccl4l <dig>  of fcgr3a and fcgr3b <cit> , and of a cluster of human beta-defensin genes on chromosome  <dig> . in all these cases, associations of gene copy number with important medical phenotypes have been reported – of ccl3l1/ccl4l <dig> with hiv infection , of fcgr3b with systemic autoimmune disorders  <cit> , and of beta-defensins with crohn’s disease and psoriasis  <cit> . in the case of crohn's disease, the associations proposed with the beta-defensin cnv have attracted controversy, particularly related to the confidence with which cnv states can be called  <cit> .

establishing robust evidence for these associations is made considerably more difficult by the technical challenge of determining accurate measures of copy number  <cit> . although most severe when the copy numbers are high, as in the case of the beta-defensins , accuracy of copy number measurement is still an important issue in the interpretation of association data even when gene copy numbers are relatively low, as in the case of ccl3l1/ccl4l <dig>  . typing copy number by real-time pcr may be subject to errors that compromise the accuracy of association studies  <cit> . these errors may arise from differences in the physicochemical state of dna samples that alter the relative behaviour of test and reference loci  <cit> . at high copy numbers the level of relative precision required to distinguish integer copy number states with accuracy may simply be beyond the capabilities of real-time pcr, however carefully it is performed  <cit> . for example, measurement error of only about 10% in analysis of a sample with a true copy number of  <dig> would result in an incorrect integer call. the quality-control difficulty created by performing case–control association studies of multi-allelic cnvs is compounded by the observation that no simple snp tags that can act as surrogates for the determination of gene copy number have been identified to date.

alternative approaches have been explored for the determination of copy number at multi-allelic loci that are simultaneously convenient, economic and accurate. for some but not all such loci  <cit> , mlpa appears to provide an appropriate level of accuracy to call most integers correctly. approaches involving paralogue ratio tests , which determine the representation of a test locus relative to a co-amplified reference locus, have also been successful in determining accurate copy number measures for even some of the more challenging loci . side-by-side comparisons  <cit>  appear to suggest greater accuracy of prt compared with real-time pcr for robust and reproducible determination of copy number at multi-allelic cnvs. in addition to prts, measurement of paralogous ratios for allelic variants  between variable repeats within a sample have also been valuable in supplementing information on gene copy number. prt measurements in combination with allelic variant ratios have previously been used successfully in multiplex measurement systems for ccl3l1/ccl4l <dig> <cit> , fcgr3a/b <cit>  and beta-defensins  <cit> .

the cluster of human alpha-defensin genes on chromosome  <dig> includes the genes defa <dig> and defa <dig>  which are copy-variable  <cit> . the genes defa <dig> and defa <dig> differ only by a single base substitution in the coding sequence, corresponding to a single amino acid difference between the peptides encoded. these genes appear to be interchangeable occupants of a 19 kb copy-variable repeat unit, with both defa <dig> and defa <dig> gene number showing variation. for this reason, aldred et al. <cit>  suggested the composite designation defa1a <dig> for the copy-variable locus. the defa <dig> and defa <dig> genes lead  to the expression of three distinct antimicrobial peptides, generally designated as hnp- <dig>  - <dig>  and - <dig>  high levels of these peptides are found in the granules of neutrophils  <cit> , and a small-scale study has suggested that the expression level of the peptides is correlated with gene copy number  <cit> .

serious technical challenges are posed by the accurate measurement of the multi-allelic copy number variation displayed by defa1a <dig>  because most individuals have  <dig> or more repeats. a full characterisation of the variation should also include a separate determination of gene copy numbers for defa <dig> and defa <dig>  furthermore, the existence of one repeat per haplotype differing substantially in sequence from others  makes application of many standard methods problematic. these factors may underlie the failure to score this cnv in the wtccc cnv study, which adopted very thorough and carefully controlled approaches to cnv typing  <cit> .

in this study, we apply and combine a range of measurement methods to determine the copy number of defa1a <dig>  and to define the relative contribution of the defa <dig> and defa <dig> gene variants. this work has allowed us to derive a consistent characterisation of copy number variation among  <dig> european samples. our data allow us to identify a single snp that effectively tags low, medium, and high-copy number states, which can therefore act as a convenient surrogate for approximate defa1a <dig> gene copy number in high-throughput studies.

RESULTS
the copy-variable alpha-defensin genes defa <dig> and defa <dig> are arranged in a variable tandem repeat on chromosome  <dig>  in which each haplotype carries a single copy of a centromeric “partial” repeat and a variable number  of 19 kb “full” repeat units . our measurements of copy number at defa1a <dig> were based on five independent measures – two paralogue ratio tests  and three measurements of ratios between variants within the variable repeat array. the ratio measurements included two examples of indels , as well as the single-base substitution that distinguishes the variant genes defa <dig> and defa <dig> .figure  <dig>

defa1a <dig> genes are found in the copy-variable 19 kb full repeat sequence and  in the centromeric partial repeat. the positions of the three snps rs <dig>  rs <dig> and rs <dig> in the centromeric flanking dna are indicated as a, b and c respectively. the specific measurement points used in this study in the determination of copy number are shown as differently-shaped symbols below the relevant locations, with the nearby defa <dig> gene providing the reference locus for the defa <dig> prt measurement . the mlt1a <dig> prt  has a target site only in full, and not partial, repeat sequences, and for this reason measures one copy less per haplotype than the other assays; calibration of mlt1a <dig> prt values is undertaken using the predicted total repeat unit count per sample, for ease of comparison with other measures.



we applied these prt measurements to evaluate defa1a <dig> copy number in  <dig> unrelated dna samples from europeans , calibrating the prt ratios against samples of known copy number . of these  <dig> samples,  <dig>  failed to produce adequate data , so that we obtained useful results for  <dig> unrelated european samples. starting from “gold standard” dna samples for which total defa1a <dig> copy number had been inferred from restriction fragment lengths  <cit> , we developed a secondary set of reference samples, drawn from publicly available sources; these were validated both using multiple measurements against the original reference samples as well as segregation within pedigrees . these new reference samples are specified in the methods, and listed separately in .

the full set of results obtained is available as additional file  <dig> . the individual accuracy of each prt method can be assessed by comparing the inferred unrounded copy number with the integer copy number deduced from overall analysis of each sample  to give a normalised measurement – for example, a prt measurement of  <dig>  for a sample with a true copy number of  <dig> would have a normalised value of  <dig> . the distributions of prt measurements normalised relative to the  correct value are shown in . the two prts appear to exhibit similar levels of variation around the mean value, with standard deviations of normalised measurements of  <dig>  and  <dig>  for mlt1a <dig> and defa <dig> prts respectively. the distribution of normalised values conforms well to a gaussian distribution over the central range of -2 < z <  <dig>  however, normalised ratios from mlt1a <dig> prt appear to have an excess of outliers at z values below about -2; see . the measures from the two prt systems  correlate well with each other , and although there is some indication of clustering around integer values for copy numbers of  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  the clusters are less distinct at higher copy numbers.figure  <dig>

in addition to the prt measurements, three allelic ratio methods were developed. these are practically very useful measures in verifying copy number measurements because of their empirical accuracy, but can be limited in the information they provide; for example, a ratio of 2: <dig> is consistent with a copy number of  <dig>  but also any multiple of  <dig>  examples of individual samples typed by these methods, with corresponding inferences about total copy number and variant constitution, are shown in table  <dig> table  <dig>

information was combined from different measurements using a likelihood-based approach similar to that employed by aldhous et al. for beta-defensins  <cit> . gaussian distributions were used to model the expected outcomes relative to the true copy number. the probabilities associated with each of the five measures , 7bpdup , and defa1:defa3) are combined by multiplication to derive an overall measure of relative likelihood for each copy number . we refer to the copy number best supported by the combined data as the “maximum likelihood copy number” , and the factor by which the support for that copy number exceeds the next best copy number  is an index of confidence in the assignment of the copy number. further details are given in the additional file  <dig>  section  <dig>  the output from this analysis for the  <dig> samples typed in this study is available as additional file  <dig> table  <dig>

detailed examples of maximum likelihood analysis from samples na <dig> , c <dig>  and na <dig>  – see also table  <dig>  although our analysis evaluates probabilities associated with copy numbers up to  <dig>  for clarity we only show values up to  <dig> here. for sample na <dig>  note that the absence of an indel <dig> ratio provides no information about likely copy numbers, and so all copy numbers are assigned an equal relative probability. the defa1:defa <dig> ratio for na <dig> is most consistent with a copy number of  <dig>  so that  a copy number of  <dig> is equally well supported. probabilities below about 10- <dig> are rounded to zero .



there was substantial variation in the confidence with which integer copy numbers were assigned, with mr ranging from just above unity  to several million-fold. the median mr value was  <dig> , and the interquartile range was  <dig> - <dig> ; most samples, therefore, were assigned an integer copy number that was supported by a factor of at least  <dig> over alternatives. low values of mr, corresponding to greater uncertainty in assignment to a particular integer, correlated as expected with  missing or uninformative data and  high copy number .

the analysis assumes that the same underlying copy number applies to all the sequence elements measured. to investigate whether any samples had evidence to the contrary, we highlighted samples as anomalous if they included one or more measure associated with a very low probability  for the maximum-likelihood copy number. we found no evidence suggesting that any of the seven cases found in this way resulted from the existence of non-standard repeat units. further discussion of this point can be found in the additional file  <dig>  section 1d.

the distributions of diploid copy numbers for the two population samples examined  did not differ significantly , and were therefore pooled to give an estimated distribution of copy numbers that should be generally applicable to white european populations . at other multiallelic cnv loci, segregation has been powerful in validating the accuracy of copy number measurements, as well as in defining the constituent haplotypes of which the diploid cnv total is composed  <cit> . we therefore examined the segregation of defa1a <dig> copy number, of the inferred numbers of defa <dig> or defa <dig> alleles, and of indel alleles, in three-generation ceph pedigrees . in  <dig> out of  <dig> families analysed in this way, all four parental haplotypes and their segregation could be inferred unambiguously from our observations alone, but in others haplotypes were resolved using the correct segregation pattern for the region as deduced from flanking snp genotypes in ceph families , which were also used to confirm the grandparental origins of the parental haplotypes, and hence deduce the identities of the four grandparental haplotypes that were not transmitted to the parents. determining frequencies of  <dig> haplotypes from segregation data allowed us to predict the expected frequencies for different diploid copy numbers under hardy-weinberg equilibrium. these predicted frequencies  are not significantly different from those observed .table  <dig>

segregation of haplotypes in the three-generation ceph family  <dig>  in addition to the copy number, segregating haplotypes  are distinguished by the composition of other variants for which ratios were determined in this study. in this figure, only the defa <dig> content of each haplotype is shown , but other variants can also be used to distinguish and characterise the haplotype content. in this family, both parents possess a 3-copy haplotype , but they are distinguished by the fact that only the haplotype  carried by the father contains a copy of defa <dig> 



comparison of haplotype copy numbers for ceu samples included in the hapmap project allowed us to investigate association between defa1a <dig> copy number and local snps. the strongest association was with rs <dig>  in a pattern corresponding to association of c at rs <dig> with 2- and 3-copy haplotypes, and t with 4- and 5-copy haplotypes. we therefore typed rs <dig> in the  <dig> samples for which we had determined copy number. a clear and strong association between rs <dig> and the copy number of alpha-defensin genes was confirmed, with the snp genotype at rs <dig> approximately partitioning european samples into low , medium  and high  copy number categories . this association is not absolute; some examples of exceptions to this correlation were observed, for example 4- and 5-copy individuals with rs <dig> genotype ct. these observations have been repeated and individually verified as genuine, and cannot therefore be attributed to inaccurate typing of copy number or of snp genotype. although the correlation illustrated in figure 4b appears consistent, a  snp genotype will always have limited ability to tag a multi-state cnv, and indeed the statistical power of rs <dig> genotype to predict defa1a <dig> cnv status is indeed relatively modest .figure  <dig>

the definition of a snp tagging defa1a <dig> copy number allows us to perform indirect association tests by interrogating existing gwas snp data. if a clinical phenotype is strongly associated with defa1a <dig> copy number, this should be indirectly reflected in an association with genotype at rs <dig>  or the associated neighbouring snps rs <dig>  and rs <dig> . indeed, because of the strong but imperfect correlation with snps, a genuine underlying association with defa1a <dig> copy number may be manifest in gwas data as a p value  too high to merit attention in a genome-wide context. complete gwas data, listing p values for all snps typed, were available from the wtccc  <cit>  and the chavi gwas study of hiv control  <cit> , and we obtained the assistance of relevant investigators in examining data from gwas studies of atopic dermatitis  <cit> , coeliac disease  <cit> , crohn’s disease  <cit> , type  <dig> diabetes  <cit> , lung function in cystic fibrosis  <cit> , multiple sclerosis  <cit> , psoriasis  <cit>  and ulcerative colitis  <cit> . these were interrogated for p values with rs <dig> or rs <dig> where genotyped, and rs <dig> in other studies. the results are collated in additional file 1: table s <dig>  and reveal no strong indication of association with the defa1a <dig> cnv as reflected indirectly in snp data. it is noteworthy that for each of crohn’s disease, psoriasis and type i diabetes there are two independent studies listed in additional file 1: table s <dig> that fail to show a significant association. although the simplest explanation of these outcomes is that these phenotypes are not influenced by defa1a <dig> copy number, even well-powered gwas have limited power to positively exclude an association, especially at low effect sizes. only coeliac disease  demonstrated a p value below  <dig>  , but given that  <dig> different studies were examined, even that cannot be viewed as significant once a correction has been made for multiple testing . the relationship between cnv status and flanking snps might be different in different populations, and we therefore examined separately the largest single  cohort in the study of dubois et al.  <cit> , consisting of  <dig> cases of coeliac disease and  <dig> controls; in this alternative analysis, the association with rs <dig> was not significant .

we can therefore use these observations to suggest that a strong influence of defa1a <dig> copy number on predisposition to any of these phenotypes in european populations is unlikely, despite the published evidence suggesting the influence of defa1a <dig> copy number in crohn’s disease  <cit>  and of increased alpha-defensin production on hiv progression  <cit> . it also provides a simple  method for further investigation of other phenotypes in which defa1a <dig> copy number may be implicated, such as the published association with sepsis  <cit> , in a way that would not be complicated by the difficulties of direct copy number measurement. nevertheless, although snp genotyping can be used as an aid to prioritisation, because the association between rs <dig> and the cnv is imperfect, direct typing of the cnv remains the only definitive way to investigate potential associations.

discussion
in the absence of high-throughput methods that confer absolute assurance of gene copy number, detailed assessment of the accuracy of a new typing methodology is essential before it can be used in large sample sets. having defined the copy number of some reference standard samples using definitive methods such as pfge, these can be then used to calibrate and test further experiments. in addition, the evaluation of accuracy requires careful analysis of the internal consistency of data derived from the integration of different measurement assays. in principle, to achieve the best typing quality, large-scale association studies should ideally use pulsed-field gel analysis, but in practice few studies have the dna resources, equipment and personnel to undertake the kind of exemplary work done at the complement c <dig> locus  <cit> . in particular, wider replication of association findings generally depends on a reliable but high-throughput method to type dna samples of the kind found in most population sampling studies.

most defa1a <dig> repeat alleles appear to harbour between  <dig> and  <dig> copies of a 19 kb copy-variable repeat, which allows different copy number alleles to be clearly distinguished after pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  <cit> . we were therefore able to use samples that had been definitively typed by this method  <cit>  as the starting-point for calibrating our methods; subsequent analysis of segregation in three-generation pedigrees defined further reference samples that displayed unambiguous copy numbers on repeated testing using prt and ratio methods . larger-scale typing then produced data that were internally consistent between prt and ratio measurements and conformed well to the predictions of hardy-weinberg equilibrium using haplotype frequencies determined in three-generation families. reassurance of the correct calibration of our typing methods is particularly important given the apparent differences with the population copy-number distributions discovered by other approaches  <cit> .

the copy-number frequencies found in this study are similar to those determined by aldred et al. <cit>  who used a combination of maph and variant ratios, and although there are some differences  the overall distribution is not significantly different . by contrast, the differences between our data and the distribution given by linzmeier and ganz  <cit>  based on real-time pcr measurements are highly significant , especially in the representation of copy numbers above  <dig> . although it is possible that different population origins may influence the outcome, even the relatively small sample analysed by linzmeier and ganz seems incompatible with the values determined here, and may reflect limitations of real-time pcr typing for this locus. the study of nuytten et al. <cit>  used real-time pcr calibrated against concatemeric constructs, but reports a copy number distribution that is also very significantly different from the one reported here , with a much lower frequency of samples with copy numbers above  <dig>  nuytten et al. do not use reference genomic dna standards, and despite their careful and ingenious method to calibrate real-time pcr measurements, it is possible that in this case their cloned constructs do not produce the same calibration as would be obtained from genomic dna samples of the same copy number. the real-time pcr results from danish samples given by jespersgaard and colleagues  <cit>  also have significantly more samples of low copy number  among controls than we find in europeans , but not among their samples from crohn’s disease patients . our preliminary analysis  demonstrates a strong correlation with integer copy numbers published recently for hapmap chinese and japanese samples by cheng et al. <cit> , although without further information on measurement variation or consistency for their real-time pcr assay it is not possible to judge the extent or causes of differences between our results.

in principle, read-depth analysis provides an alternative method to establish definitive diploid gene copy number for a sample, and the study of sudmant et al. <cit>  first used genome-wide analyses of read depth to define copy number variation profiles for individual dna samples. although the available data suggest that their analysis of the defa1a <dig> cnv is broadly comparable with ours , no individual copy number values are given by sudmant et al., and their sample of  <dig> individuals comes from diverse global populations  <cit> . there were eight samples typed in our study which have also been sequenced as part of the complete genomics cnv genome baseline set  <cit> . our copy numbers for these samples have a strong correlation  with the recorded sequence coverage . microarray data for  <dig> hapmap samples from campbell et al. <cit>   correlate reasonably well with our results , even though the defa1a <dig> cnv does not form discrete genotype classes in their analyses, and the absolute copy numbers are calibrated by comparison of microarray signals against single-copy regions rather than specifically against known defa1a <dig> copy numbers. presumably for this reason, campbell et al. report copy number ranges for defa1a <dig> higher than measured in this study . these analyses are described in additional file  <dig>  section  <dig>  and illustrated by a scatterplot in additional file 1: figure s <dig>  although the defa1a <dig> cnv was not called individually in the  <dig> million-element array-cgh study of conrad et al.  <cit> , their publicly available data can be compared with our own results for  <dig> samples, in which a good correlation  is found . the cnv at defa1a <dig> does not seem to have been defined and analysed in other recent studies on genome-wide identification of cnvs through read-depth analysis  <cit> .

by comparison with flanking snp genotypes in hapmap samples we were able to define a strong association between defa1a <dig> copy number and rs <dig>  to a first approximation this single snp partitions our samples into classes with low , medium  and high  copy number, although initial further work suggests that this is not a simple cladistic split into high- and low-copy lineages . in addition to its practical power in exploring possible associations of defa1a <dig> copy number with disease phenotypes, the strength and consistency of this association provides additional reassurance that our copy number typing is not subject to wide variation in accuracy. it is important to note that the samples analysed here are of european origin, and so rs <dig> can be used with confidence as a surrogate for defa1a <dig> copy number only in european cohorts. most published gwas data sets do indeed analyse european subjects, but our initial exploration of the hapmap samples suggests that the strong association of rs <dig> with copy number is not reproduced in asian or african populations.

CONCLUSIONS
we have developed a pcr-based methodology for copy number measurement of the human alpha-defensin defa1a <dig> gene cluster. our data show good internal evidence of accuracy and consistency, and we have discovered that defa1a <dig> copy number is strongly associated with snp rs <dig> in european samples. this has in turn led to the application to gwas investigations of rs <dig> genotype as a good proxy for approximate copy number range in europeans.
