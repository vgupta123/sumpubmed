BACKGROUND
sponges  are the first diverging metazoans. they are thus a key phylum in the understanding of the genomic characteristics of the metazoan ancestor  <cit> . for example, recent findings indicate that the sponge mitochondria possess ancestral characters that have been lost in other metazoans, such as additional genes, minimally modified genetic code, or bacteria-like rrna structure  <cit> . one intriguing finding is that most metazoan mitochondrial genomes lack introns. mitochondrial introns may be present in large numbers and in many genes in the sister clades of metazoa: choanoflagellida  <cit> , ichthyosporea  <cit>  and fungi  <cit> . for example, the mitochondrial genome of the fungi podospora anserina  contains  <dig> introns located in nine different genes, including  <dig> introns in the cox <dig> gene, which encode the subunit  <dig> of cytochrome c oxidase . however, none of these introns are obligatory and some fungi do not include introns in their mitochondrial genome . in metazoa, mitochondrial introns have only been described in cnidaria of the subclass zoantharia  <cit> . in sea anemones , two mitochondrial introns have been found, one in the cox <dig> gene and one in the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> gene . in stony corals , however, only the nd <dig> gene contains an intron. the relative position of this intron is conserved between sea anemone and stony corals. other cnidarians  do not seem to possess mitochondrial introns  <cit> .

mitochondrial introns are self-splicing ribozymes. self-splicing introns are divided into either group i or group ii depending on their secondary structure. while group ii introns are prevalent in plants, the mitochondrial introns of cnidaria, choanoflagellida and ichtyosporea are all of group i. in the mitochondria of fungi both types of introns can be found, though group i is more prevalent  <cit> . self-splicing introns are mobile genetic elements  <cit> . they often encode homing endonucleases and/or maturases. homing endonucleases cleave chromosomes and exploit the recombinational repair system of the cell for their multiplication. maturases act as cofactors that bind the precursor rna containing their intron to facilitate its folding and splicing  <cit> . it should be noted that enzymes of the laglidadg family  can function as endonuclease, as maturase, or perform both functions. however, not all introns encode homing endonuclease or maturase. for example, the peculiar intron located in the nd <dig> gene of cnidaria does not encode a homing endonuclease, although it encodes other mitochondrial genes  <cit> .

although three mitochondrial genomes of sponges have been recently sequenced  <cit> , no intron was found in these genomes. we report here that a sponge mitochondrial gene contains a group i intron, which encodes a putative laglidadg member. we also provide phylogenetic evidence suggesting that the sponge intron was acquired by horizontal gene transfer.

RESULTS
we amplified cox <dig> genes from nine demosponge species. all sponge species yielded similar cox <dig> pcr products  except tetilla sp. , whose product was much longer . sequencing this gene revealed a putative intron of  <dig> bp. this suggests that introns can also be found in the mitochondrial genome of sponges. interestingly, the intron was located in the middle of the reverse primer used by nichols et al.  <cit>  to amplify cox <dig> gene of sponges. it is highly unlikely that the tetilla cox <dig> sequence is a nuclear copy or a contamination, for three reasons: i. we extracted enriched mitochondrial dna to avoid amplification of nuclear copies of mitochondrial sequences   <cit> ; ii. no frameshift mutations were noticeable in the cox <dig> sequence; and iii. an identical sequence was obtained from two individuals collected from separate locations.

characteristics of the predicted tetilla sp. intron
a study of the relative position of introns in the cox <dig> gene  revealed that the tetilla sp. intron is inserted at position  <dig> of the alignment provided in additional file  <dig>  this insertion point corresponds to positions 672– <dig> of the cox <dig> coding sequence  of tetilla. unlike the tetilla intron, the sea anemone intron is located at position  <dig> of the alignment . in fact, no intron  was found to be inserted at exactly the same nucleotide position as the predicted sponge intron. however, introns are located at positions  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the alignment , thus suggesting a hot spot for intron insertion .

secondary structure predictions show that the tetilla intron can be folded into a canonical group i intron, except for the absence of the paired region p <dig> . a blast analysis reveals that the predicted intron sequence shows low primary sequence similarity with sequences present in the data banks. however, the conserved p, q, r, and s regions, which form the main core of group i introns, can be aligned between the tetilla intron and fungal mitochondrial introns. in figure  <dig> we compare the core region of the tetilla intron with the core region of eight other introns. five of these introns were chosen because their encoded laglidadg was closely related to the tetilla's laglidadg . we also included in the comparison the three available animal introns with published secondary structure  <cit> . interestingly, the introns that include closely related laglidadgs  do not include the paired region p <dig>  unfortunately, the presence or absence of p <dig> could not be reliably determined for the cox <dig> intron  <dig> of smittium culisetae. the absence of p <dig> paired-region in closely related introns suggests that the absence of p <dig> is genuine in the tetilla intron and not an artifact produced by the method used. the cnidarian introns, in contrast, contain a p <dig> region, suggesting that they are less related to the tetilla intron than the fungal introns mentioned above.

mitochondrial introns often encode various proteins  <cit> . hence, the predicted tetilla intron was translated in all six reading frames using the coelenterate/mold mitochondrial genetic code . the translation revealed an open reading frame  of  <dig> bp starting from the first nucleotide of the intron . the main difference between the standard and the sponge mitochondrial genetic codes is that tga codes for a stop codon in the standard genetic code while in the sponge mitochondria it codes for tryptophan. the intron orf includes three tga codons in positions  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> of the intron sequence, indicating that the coding sequence of the intron is not of a nuclear origin.

the blast analysis of the orf suggests that it encodes an enzyme from the laglidadg endonuclease-maturase family. laglidadg is the largest family of homing endonucleases, whose members are characterized by the presence of the conserved motif laglidadg in one or two copies. crystal structures of laglidadg endonucleases-maturases have revealed that single-motif proteins function as homodimers while double-motif enzymes are monomers  <cit> . two laglidadg motifs were identified in the tetilla orf  located in positions 101– <dig> and 212– <dig> of the orf protein sequence.

phylogenetic tree of the coi protein sequence
to confirm that the tetilla sequence was not a fungal contamination, a phylogenetic tree of metazoa and its closest sister clades  was reconstructed based on coi protein sequences  and was rooted with fungal sequences. the resulting phylogeny is in agreement with previous phylogenetic trees based on mitochondrial sequences  <cit> . as expected, animals are monophyletic  and divided into two clades: diploblastica  and bilateria . the monophyly of diploblasts contradicts the rna-based phylogenies that place sponges at the base of metazoa  <cit> . the monophyly of diploblasts is likely to be the consequence of a long branch artefact resulting from the high rate of evolution of bilateria  <cit> . the relationships within these two clades are not highly supported. bilateria are divided into protostomia  and deuterostomia . diploblasts are divided into cnidaria  and demospongiae . the bayesian reconstruction does not support the monophyly of porifera but instead places cnidaria as the sister clade of xestospongia . thus, although the bayesian and maximum likelihood  trees support slightly different topologies, those differences only involve weakly supported nodes . among porifera, tetilla sp.  clusters with geodia  with high support values . this relationship is in agreement with traditional morphology-based classification and rrna sequence analyses, which group the orders astrophorida and spirophorida together  <cit> . sponge relationships show very low support value. among the three orders represented by two species each  only verongida appears as monophyletic . because relationships within sponges are not highly supported in both ml and bayesian analyses, it is unknown whether the paraphyly of these genera reflects sponge history or lack of phylogenetic signal in the coi sequences.

phylogenetic tree of the laglidadg
laglidadg genes are present in all branches of the tree of life. among eukaryotes they are widespread in the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes and usually associated with group i introns although they have also been found to be encoded by group ii introns  <cit> . they are less common in the nuclear genome and in this case they are associated with self-splicing inteins rather than introns  <cit> . the most similar sequences to the intron orf of tetilla, according to the blast search, are the laglidadg sequences located in the cox <dig> gene of fungi. among the  <dig> non-identical sequences analyzed, only  <dig> sequences  were not cox <dig> sequences . these  <dig> sequences originated either from chloroplastic introns of algae  or from mitochondrial introns located in the nadh dehydrogenase subunit  <dig> , small-subunit rrna , atp synthase subunit  <dig> , and cytochrome b  genes. similarly, only  <dig> sequences did not originate from fungi but from green algae , embryophyta , choanoflagellida , ichthyosporea , and metazoa .

phylogenetic reconstructions indicate a complicated evolutionary history for these homing endonuclease sequences . because the laglidadg protein tree has little to do with the species tree it was impossible to define an outgroup. in the tree, the predicted tetilla sequence is associated with the laglidadg sequence located in the 4th cox <dig> intron of smittium culisetae. however, these two sequences show only 57% of identity in the conserved part of the laglidadg alignment and the support values are weak for this grouping . similarly, the laglidadg sequence present in the sea anemone metridium senile does not show any close relationship with any of the sequences present in the data bank. more generally, intron sequences present in the same gene or in closely-related organisms do not form monophyletic groups. for example, neither chloroplast sequences nor animal sequences clustered together. only the plant sequences  and five nd <dig> sequences  form two coherent groups.

discussion
insertion and deletion of mobile introns are common evolutionary events resulting in a sporadic distribution of these elements  <cit> . consequently, the presence of an intron in a lineage but not in its sister clades can always be explained by independent losses. however, three lines of evidence suggest that the predicted tetilla sp. intron arose by horizontal gene transfer rather than by independent losses. first, parsimony analysis of intron presence and absence favors a scenario of a recent intron introduction in spirophorida since all other ten sponges for which the cox <dig> gene was determined lack an intron . second, the cnidarian intron is not located at the same position as the sponge intron, suggesting an independent evolutionary origin . third, phylogenetic analyses clearly show that the intron-encoded laglidadg sequence and the cox <dig> exonic sequence share different phylogenetic histories . the tetilla coi protein is of sponge origin and its phylogeny agrees with previous sponge molecular phylogeny  <cit> , while the laglidadg-based phylogenetic tree indicates that the tetilla intron orf is closer to fungal than to cnidarian or choanoflagelate sequences . thus, the intron might be of fungal origin.

it is unlikely that the intron was transferred from the nuclear genome. the orf can be translated with the sponge/mold/cnidarian mitochondrial genetic code but not with the nuclear genetic code. the mitochondrial origin of this sequence is also supported by the fact that the orf sequence is more similar to cox <dig> laglidadg than to ribosomal laglidadg .

we predicted the first sponge mitochondrial intron and our phylogenetic analyses indicate that it might have a fungal origin. a fungal origin implies that the sponge and the donor interacted in such a way as to allow the transfer of the intron. this suggests the existence of a symbiosis between tetilla sp. and a fungus donor of the intron.

there is an increasing interest recently in marine fungi as a source of novel bioactive-compounds  <cit> . more than  <dig> species of marine fungi, mainly ascomycota, have been described  <cit>  and the number is constantly rising  <cit> . unfortunately, no cox <dig> gene has yet been sequenced from marine derived fungi. in the marine environment, fungi have been isolated from sediments, algae, plants, fish, crabs, tunicates, corals, and sponges  <cit> . in spite of the fact that many fungi had been isolated from sponges  <cit> , the existence of a sponge-fungus symbiosis is under debate. no fungi had been observed within a sponge and it was therefore supposed that only dormant fungi propagules are present within sponges. the first clear case of an endosymbiotic yeast was recently discovered in sponges of the genus chondrilla  <cit> . additionally, another recent molecular study gave the first proof that sponges have the ability to recognize fungi in their surrounding environment  <cit> . our results thus introduce additional evidence in favor of a sponge-fungus symbiosis.

because horizontal gene transfers of group i introns encoding laglidadg are frequent among fungi, we could not determine which lineage of fungi was at the origin of the sponge intron. the sponge laglidadg sequence clusters with the laglidadg present in the fourth cox <dig> intron of smittium culisetae. however, the location of the laglidadg orf is different in these two introns . most of the orf is located in the paired region p <dig> in tetilla while in smittium it is located before the paired region p <dig>  this suggests that the orf and the rest of the intron  have independent origins, thus complicating our understanding of the sponge intron origin. because the diversity of marine organisms is still poorly known and because sponges are remarkable for their widespread symbiosis with various organisms  <cit> , we cannot exclude the hypothesis that an unknown unicellular eukaryote was the donor of the intron. the accumulation of new data on marine fungi mitochondrial genomes is likely to shed additional light on the sponge intron origin and perhaps also on the origin of the laglidadg sequence in cnidaria.

CONCLUSIONS
our analysis suggests that a cross-kingdom horizontal gene transfer event occurred in the sponge mitochondrial genome. such events are remarkable from the evolutionary point of view, because they demonstrate an unexpected plasticity of the mitochondrial genomes of basal metazoa compared to the more conserved genomes of bilateria. porifera and cnidaria mtdnas have been characterized by the presence of additional horizontally-transferred genes  <cit> , introns  <cit> , trna duplications  <cit> , and trna losses  <cit> . our results suggest that a better sampling of these animals might improve our understanding of the evolution of this genome.

there are many exciting evolutionary events in marine organisms that are only now starting to be discovered, and these events will provide new insights concerning the evolution of the animal kingdom. ecological relationships are known to have implications at the genomic level. here, an ecological relationship between a sponge and a fungus  is suggested, based on the genomic analysis.
