BACKGROUND
plants require at least  <dig> essential mineral elements to complete their life-cycles  <cit> . these include nitrogen , phosphorus , potassium , calcium , magnesium  and sulphur , which are macronutrients required in large amounts . the micronutrients chlorine , boron , iron , manganese , zinc , copper , nickel  and molybdenum  are required in smaller amounts   <cit> . plants also accumulate non-essential elements, some of which have little or no effect on plant growth and development at the concentrations they occur in nature, and others of which may have beneficial and/or detrimental effects depending upon their concentrations in plant tissues. these include arsenic , cadmium , selenium , silicon  and sodium .

most mineral elements are taken up in ionic form from the soil solution by plant roots. traits/phenes affecting root morphology and anatomy play a key role in the acquisition of mineral nutrients by plants and impact on crop yields . for example, increased root hairs and shallower basal root growth angles can increase p uptake  <cit> . reduced allocation of carbon to root structures via increased aerenchyma and reduced cortical cell file formations  <cit>  and smaller root diameter  <cit>  may allow some plants more efficient access to larger soil volumes, and thereby water and nutrients. the subsequent uptake and utilisation of mineral elements by plants is controlled by traits affecting ion transport, translocation and sequestration  <cit> . mineral elements in both chelated and free-ionic forms move across the root via apoplastic  and symplastic  pathways to the stele. following xylem loading and subsequent transport to transpiring leaf tissues, elements are taken up from the leaf apoplast by specific cell types. translocation of mineral elements in the plants to non-transpiring or xylem-deficient tissues occurs via the phloem  <cit> . some elements are highly mobile in phloem tissues , some are relatively immobile in the phloem , and some elements have intermediate mobility  .

the term ‘ionome’ defines the complement of mineral elements in all of their chemical forms within an organism or tissue, irrespective of whether they are essential or non-essential  <cit> . the ionome is thus the inorganic subset of the metabolome at a given moment in space and time, which varies at all scales. within an individual plant, an ionome is specific to tissue type and developmental stage; e.g. seed, fruit and tuber concentrations of ca are lower than leaf concentrations of ca due to its limited phloem mobility  <cit> . between individuals, the ionome of a specific tissue type varies due to environmental and genetic factors at all scales and this can be observed as differences between populations, species, and plant families .

variation in the ionomes of edible crop tissues has enabled identification of quantitative trait loci  linked to mineral composition and important to human and animal nutrition in several crop species  <cit> . for example, genetic loci affecting the mineral composition of leaves of brassica oleracea  <cit> , brassica rapa  <cit> , brassica napus  <cit>  and lotus japonicus  <cit>  have been identified. in the study of bus et al.  <cit> , there were strong pair-wise positive correlations in the shoot concentrations of many of the  <dig> mineral elements in  <dig> d old b. napus . furthermore, there were many pair-wise negative correlations between the shoot concentrations of several elements, notably ca and k, and numerous leaf and seedling size related traits. plant ionomes are also amenable to genetic dissection using natural and induced genetic variation via mutagenesis, using association mapping and reverse genetic approaches. several genes underlying variation in mineral nutrient acquisition and translocation have recently been identified. for example, in arabidopsis thaliana, a deletion mutant with a reduced leaf ca concentration led subsequently to the identification of esb <dig>  which affects casparian band formation  <cit> . a mutant with reduced leaf mg, ca, fe, and mo and increased leaf na and k concentration was similarly associated with reduced sphingolipid biosynthesis  <cit> . a variety of other arabidopsis genes are associated with phenotypic variation in leaf as  <cit> , cd  <cit> , k  <cit> , s and se  <cit> .


brassica napus is an important crop in global terms, with crop types including oilseed rape , vegetable swede, and fodder crops. currently, oilseed types of osr are the third largest source of vegetable oil globally after soybean and oil palm. worldwide production of osr was  <dig>  mt in  <dig>  <cit> . other uses for osr oils include biodiesel and rape meal for animal feeds, and co-products, including vitamin e  and cholesterol lowering compounds  from the oil, and waxes from pod walls with medical/cosmetic properties. further industrial oils are currently underexploited but could increase economic margins for farmers. there is considerable scope for improvement of yield of seeds and co-products if suitable traits can be identified and introduced into well-adapted varieties, for example, through improvements in yield and resource-use efficiency  <cit> . worldwide average yields for osr have increased from  <dig>  to 2 t ha− <dig> from  <dig> to  <dig>  yields are higher in western europe, with  <dig> average yields of  <dig>  t ha− <dig>  the long term average yield of uk osr is  <dig>  t ha− <dig>  <cit> , which is much less than uk wheat  and uk barley  yet it is similarly nutrient-intensive  <cit> . the yields of uk osr are also far less than their estimated potential of > <dig>  t ha− <dig>  <cit> .

the aim of this study was to determine the phenotypic diversity in root morphology, shoot ionomic  and seed size/yield traits within a broad genetic diversity panel of b. napus  and to identify their relationship to crop habit. determining the phenotypic diversity in these traits, and their interrelationships, in this population could inform subsequent studies to dissect the genetic bases and identify markers in traits relevant for crop improvement  <cit> . an increased understanding of these traits could also help in breeding strategies via more conventional means. to our knowledge, no previous studies have simultaneously characterised the phenotypic variation in root morphology, ionomes and seed size from such a large diversity panel, which is likely to capture most of the species-wide variation in these traits in b. napus.

methods
plant material for all experiments
inbred lines of brassica napus l. genotypes were used in this study. these were from the eranet-assyst consortium diversity population . a core panel of  <dig> genotypes were selected, comprising  <dig> winter,  <dig> spring, and seven semiwinter oilseed rape ,  <dig> swede,  <dig> winter fodder, and  <dig> exotic/unspecified habits . two cultivation systems were deployed. seedling root traits were determined in a ‘pouch and wick’ hydroponic system in a controlled environment  room. leaf and seed mineral composition traits were measured on compost-grown plants grown in a designed experiment in a polytunnel.

root phenotyping in a pouch and wick system
the ‘pouch and wick’ high-throughput phenotyping  system was reported previously  <cit> . this system comprised growth pouches assembled from blue germination paper , re-cut to 24 × 30 cm and overlain with black polythene . along one of the shorter edges, the paper and polythene were clipped together to an acrylic rod  using ‘bulldog’-type fold-back clips. the growth pouches were suspended above plastic drip trays, supported within lightweight aluminium/polycarbonate frames . each drip tray contained 2 l of 25 % strength hoagland’s solution  made with deionised water. drip trays were replenished with 500 ml of deionised water every  <dig> d. prior to sowing, the pouches were suspended above the nutrient solution for a minimum of 4 h to become fully saturated. within each aluminium frame, nine drip trays were used, arranged in three columns and three rows. pouches were allocated randomly to drip trays,  <dig> or  <dig> pouches per drip tray, thus  <dig> pouches and  <dig> plants per frame . a total of four frames were used in each experimental run, giving a potential sample size of  <dig> plants per run within the ce room. the ce room was  <dig>  m width,  <dig>  m length,  <dig>  m height, set to a 12 h photoperiod 18/15 °c day/night temperatures and relative humidity of 60–80 %. photosynthetically active radiation  was approximately 207 μmol m− <dig> s− <dig>  generated by 400 w white fluorescent lamps .

a single seed was sown on each germination paper, in the middle of the upper edge of the paper, by pressing the seed into the paper. the potential effect of seed size on root traits was controlled for by selecting individual seeds which spanned a range of sizes for each genotype, therefore giving a mean seed diameter of ~ <dig>  mm for each genotype. seeds of each genotype were sieved using mesh with a diameter  of  <dig> ,  <dig> ,  <dig>  and  <dig>  mm . seed retained within the mesh of each faction were selected such that 25 % of seed represented each Ø-category for each genotype. where insufficient seeds were available for a given Ø-category, the next smallest Ø-category was used instead.

fourteen days after sowing , the polythene sheets were removed from all pouches and images were taken of the germination paper and root system for downstream image analysis. images were taken using a digital single lens reflex  camera  with a focal length of 35 mm at a fixed height of 75 cm. the root images from the htp system were renamed with each sample’s unique experimental design information using bulk rename utility . images were cropped by reducing extraneous pixels on bulked images, using xnconvert . cropped images were analysed using rootreader2d   <cit> . first, a ‘batch process’ was carried out which automatically ‘thresholds’, ‘skeletonises’ and ‘builds segments’ of all images in bulk. the root system was then measured on individual images by placing a marker at the base and tip of the primary root. from these markers, rr2d automatically calculates primary root length , lateral root length  of all laterals, and lateral root number . further traits calculated from these data included total root length , mean lateral root length  and lateral root density . a database was developed which integrated the experimental design information from the image name, with the rr2d measurements for each sample, using a programming script .

of the core panel of  <dig> genotypes,  <dig> genotypes comprising  <dig> winter,  <dig> spring and seven semiwinter osr,  <dig> winter fodder,  <dig> swede and  <dig> exotic/unspecified types were screened. two additional reference winter osr lines were screened in each experimental run. each experimental run comprised  <dig> genotypes, of  <dig> individuals per genotype. there were  <dig> experimental runs in total. this equates to a total of  <dig>  potential images. an image was removed from analysis if the seed had failed to germinate, or if the seed had rolled down the paper and therefore the shoot failed to emerge above the pouch, or if the seedling was stunted with a radicle < 3 cm, or the radicle appeared deformed such as being twisted around the seed. overall, 29 % of samples were removed from analysis; excluded data are noted in additional file 1: table s <dig> and all images are available on request.

the relative contribution of genotypic and non-genotypic variance components underlying variation in root traits were calculated using a reml  procedure according to the model . genotype was subsequently added as a fixed factor to estimate genotype-means of root traits.

leaf and seed mineral composition traits in soil-grown plants
growth of plant material
seed of all genotypes were sown directly into fine-grade  compost-based growing media  in modular propagation trays . sowing took place from  <dig> to  <dig> october  <dig>  the compost was covered with perlite and transferred to a glasshouse vented at 15 °c . supplementary, artificial lighting  was used to maintain day lengths of 12 h light d− <dig>  watering was once daily by hand as required until transplantation. from  <dig> to  <dig> january  <dig>  five plants of each genotype were transplanted into individual 5 l pots  containing levington c <dig> compost . pots were arranged within two single-skinned polytunnels  with no additional lighting or heating, at the sutton bonington campus of the university of nottingham .

pots were arranged in a randomised block design of five replicate blocks using an r script . three replicates were allocated to one polytunnel, two to the other. each replicate comprised  <dig> units, including one of each of the  <dig> core genotypes, plus  <dig> reference genotypes added to enable more accurate normalisation. a further  <dig> genotypes were included to fill gaps. each replicate block was split into  <dig> sub-blocks of  <dig> genotypes, which were allocated at random. where a lack of germination meant that insufficient plants were available at the transplanting stage, empty, compost-filled pots were used in their place.

automatic irrigation was controlled in each polytunnel by a hunter irrigation controller . water from a header tank was distributed by a pump  such that each pot received 133 ml of water at 08: <dig>  12: <dig> and 16: <dig> each day, via a low density polyethylene  pipe based irrigation system fitted with compensated, non-leaking  drippers at 4 l h− <dig> capacity. each cnl dripper supplied four pots using an attached, four-tipped manifold . each system was also fitted with a dosatron d3gl- <dig> feed injector  used to provide plants with kristalon red npk fertiliser  between  <dig> march and  <dig> may  <dig>  this was set to mix fertiliser from a stock solution  into water at a ratio of one part stock solution to  <dig> parts water before being sent to the pots. plants were covered by 380 × 900 mm micro-perforated pollination bags  once inflorescences began to show to prevent cross pollination. any side shoots that emerged after bagging were cut. watering was reduced to 50 % from  <dig> june  <dig> and switched off completely from  <dig> july  <dig> to encourage senescence. all plants were sprayed with  <dig>  %  azoxystrobin  to control first signs of phoma and some botrytis on  <dig> november  <dig> and were sprayed again on  <dig> january  <dig> and  <dig> february  <dig>  tebuconazole  and amistar were applied at a rate of  <dig>  %  on  <dig> april  <dig>  aphid control was by  <dig>  %  pirimicarb  on  <dig> may  <dig> and  <dig>  %  deltamethrin  on  <dig> june  <dig> 

the total quantity of experimental units was  <dig>  all plants were harvested from the polytunnels from  <dig> to  <dig> july  <dig>  stems were cut just above the bottom of the micro-perforated bag containing the top of plants. each bag was then tied up such that no plant material could escape. labelled bags were placed into 1 m <dig> ventilated crates for storage prior to threshing. crates containing plant material were transported to elsoms seeds , where they were threshed for seed with an src single plant thresher  and cleaned using a selecta seed cleaner . thousand seed weight for each plant was measured using a contador seed counter . total seed yield per plant are indicative data, since side-stems were removed where these grew outside of the bags.

sampling, digestion and analysis of leaf samples
leaves were sampled at the rosette stage  from  <dig> to  <dig> march  <dig>  a minimum of three fully expanded leaves were cut from the plant, weighed and photographed while fresh. leaves from each plant were stored in separate labelled paper bags at -20 °c. all samples were freeze dried  for 48–60 h, and re-weighed. leaves were homogenised in liquid n <dig> using a pestle and mortar and kept frozen prior to analyses.

subsamples  of leaf were digested using a microwave system comprising a multiwave  <dig> platform with a 48-vessel mf <dig> rotor ; digestion vessels were perfluoroalkoxy  liner material and polyethylethylketone  pressure jackets . leaf material was digested in 2 ml 70 % trace analysis grade hno <dig>  1 ml milli-q water , and 1 ml h2o <dig> with microwave settings as follows: power = 1400 w, temp = 140 °c, pressure = 2 mpa, time = 45 min. two operational blanks were included in each digestion run. duplicate samples of certified reference material  of leaf  were included approximately every fourth digestion run; laboratory reference material  from pooled / freeze-dried brassica napus leaves was also used for later digests. following digestion, each tube was made up to a final volume of 15 ml by adding 11 ml milli-q water and transferred to a 25 ml universal tube  and stored at room temperature.

leaf digestates were diluted 1-in- <dig> using milli-q water prior to elemental analysis. the concentrations of  <dig> elements were obtained using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry ; ag, al, as, b, ba, ca, cd, cr, co, cs, cu, fe, k, mg, mn, mo, na, ni, p, pb, rb, s, se, sr, ti, u, v, zn. operational modes included:  a helium collision-cell  with kinetic energy discrimination to remove polyatomic interferences,  standard mode  in which the collision cell was evacuated, and  a hydrogen collision-cell . samples were introduced from an autosampler incorporating an asxpress™ rapid uptake module  through a peek nebulizer . internal standards were introduced to the sample stream on a separate line via the asxpress unit and included sc , rh , ge  and ir  in 2 % trace analysis grade hno <dig> . external multi-element calibration standards  included ag, al, as, b, ba, cd, ca, co, cr, cs, cu, fe, k, mg, mn, mo, na, ni, p, pb, rb, s, se, sr, ti , u, v and zn, in the range 0–100 μg l− <dig> . a bespoke external multi-element calibration solution  was used to create ca, k, mg and na standards in the range 0–30 mg l− <dig>  boron, p and s calibration utilized in-house standard solutions . in-sample switching was used to measure b and p in std mode, se in h2-cell mode and all other elements in he-cell mode. sample processing was undertaken using qtegra™ software  with external cross-calibration between pulse-counting and analogue detector modes when required. in total,  <dig> samples were analysed in  <dig> icp-ms runs.

digestion and analysis of seed samples
dry seeds  were transferred into pyrex test tubes . after weighing an appropriate number of samples the masses of the remaining samples were calculated using method of danku et al.  <cit> . the seed samples were left overnight to pre-digest in  <dig>  ml trace metal grade hno <dig>  spiked with indium internal standard and  <dig>  ml h2o <dig>  was also added. they were then digested in dry block heaters  at 115 °c for 4 h.

seed digestates were diluted to  <dig>  ml with milli-q water  and aliquots transferred to 96-well deep well plates using adjustable multichannel pipette  for analysis. elemental analysis was performed with an icp-ms  in the standard mode. twenty elements  were monitored. liquid reference material composed of pooled samples of the digested seed materials was prepared before the first sample run and was used throughout the remaining sample runs. the liquid reference material was included after every ninth sample in all icp-ms sample sets to correct for variation between and within icp-ms analysis runs  <cit> . sample concentrations were calculated using external calibration method within the instrument software. the calibration standards  were prepared from single element standards  solutions. in total,  <dig> samples were analysed across four icp-ms runs.

data processing of leaf and seed mineral composition traits
for each data-point, an element-specific operational blank concentration  was subtracted. data were then multiplied by initial sample volume, divided by the initial dry mass of plant material, and converted to mg element kg− <dig> of dry leaf or seed material. element-specific limits of detection  were reported as three times the standard deviation  of the operational blank concentrations, assuming a notional starting dry weight of  <dig>  g for leaf and  <dig>  g for seed data . for leaves, element-specific recoveries from crms ranged from  <dig> to 134 %, for  <dig> elements with certified crm values . from leaf mineral concentration data, seven elements  were removed from further analysis due to having mean mineral concentrations which were less than or close to the lod . likewise, seven elements  were removed from seed mineral concentration data . for those elements retained for analysis, data for individual leaf and seed element concentrations which were below element-specific lods were replaced with half lod values. leaf and seed element concentrations > <dig> standard deviation  above the global arithmetic mean for each element were also removed as a precaution against using contaminated samples .

the relative contribution of genotypic and non-genotypic variance components underlying variation in leaf and seed composition traits was calculated using a reml procedure in genstat. genotype, habit and experimental sources of variation were classed as random factors according to the model . for leaf composition traits, a further model was used  in which genotype was subsequently added as a fixed factor to estimate genotype-means. for seeds, the arithmetic mean data were used for each genotype.

multivariate analysis of root morphology and mineral composition traits
correlation analysis was conducted on all  <dig> possible pairwise combinations of the  <dig> root, leaf and seed trait variate sets . five stepwise discriminant analyses were conducted in genstat, one each for the root morphology-, leaf- and seed mineral- and seed weight variate sets, which contained  <dig>   <dig>  and two variates, respectively, and one for the variate set of all traits combined. genotypes were grouped according to ‘crop habit’. the wilks’ lambda ‘forward selection’ stepwise algorithm option was selected, which, at each step, adds the trait-variate which explains the most between-group variation from all of the remaining trait-variate sets. specificity plots were drawn, to view the proportion of genotypes of each ‘crop habit’ correctly allocated to each group, at each step. discrimination plots were drawn to represent the separation of variation in the crop habits in two dimensions. all statistical analyses were conducted using genstat 15th edition .

RESULTS
root growth was influenced strongly by seed size
seed diameter accounted for a large proportion of the variation in total root length , primary root length , lateral root length  and lateral root number , but not for mean lateral root length  or lateral root density  in  <dig> d old seedlings . genotype/habit factors accounted for between 7 %  and 17 %  of the total variation in the six root traits. residual  variation accounted for the largest single source of variation in the study, up to  <dig> and 81 % for lrd and mlrl, respectively, indicating that lateral roots traits are particularly responsive to the environment. this large residual source of variation is consistent with previous studies of brassica seedling root traits, which show that large numbers of individuals are required to detect subtle differences in root traits between genotypes with confidence  <cit> . thousand seed weight  in the  <dig> seed, from which all plants were grown, varied significantly within and between crop habits, from largest to smallest in: semiwinter osr, winter osr, spring osr, winter fodder and swede types . however, whilst seed diameter had a significant positive correlation with root length, based on the data for individual seedlings, potential correlations between tsw and root length could not be tested in this study because seeds were selected for uniformity between genotypes based on diameter classification and not by individual seed weights.table  <dig> variance components analysis of root morphology, seed yield and leaf and seed mineral composition traits in brassica napus, showing the variation  in the trait associated with genotype, habit, experimental design and residual factors, , as determined by residual maximum likelihood  analyses

positive relationships have been reported previously between seed size and the seminal root length and total root weight of barley   <cit> , and between seed size and total root size and lateral root number in tomato   <cit> . larger seeds have also been shown to improve seedling establishment, shoot weight, biomass and final yield in some, but not all field studies of osr in canada . however, larger-sized seeds typically had more vigorous early growth  <cit> . thousand seed weight was also shown to correlate positively with absolute growth rate 21 days after germination  <cit> . improved seed size-related root growth of b. napus seedlings might also increase tolerance to shoot pests   <cit>  and root diseases such as rhizoctonia solani which can damage the primary roots of b. napus  <cit> . seed weight has previously been associated with pre-emergence growth in a bi-parental mapping population of brassica oleracea, but under separate genetic control to germination  <cit> . additionally, the present study found that the thousand seed weight  in the winter osr varieties from different release periods has steadily increased over time, suggesting that larger seeds may have been bred for . this present study shows there is scope to exploit the genetic control of seed size-related root growth as a potential route to improve early vigour in the small-seeded b. napus.

winter osr and fodder types had larger root systems than other crop habits
winter osr and winter fodder types had a greater mean trl, prl, tlrl, and lnr at  <dig> d than the other crop habits . semiwinter osr had a shorter mean prl than all other habits , and a greater mean lrd . it is important to note that these differences in root system size between osr crop types were observed when seeds of uniform diameter were sown for each genotype. increased root length in seedlings is likely to indicate increased early vigour. velicka et al.  <cit>  observed that early sowing afforded a greater root collar thickness and leaf number, and these earlier sown plants had greater over-winter survival and more rapid accumulation of matter in the apical bud in spring. furthermore, scott et al.  <cit>  observed that earlier sowing significantly increased seed yield because of increased leaf and root growth. seedling root-length traits, measured in this same ‘pouch and wick’ system, correlated with early plant growth and final seed yield in  <dig> commercial winter osr b. napus genotypes  <cit> . finch-savage et al.  <cit>  suggested that vigorous early root growth is essential for small seeded crops such as brassica to acquire resources before desiccation occurs. a fast-growing, thick root collar contains large amounts of soluble carbohydrates which will enable the plant to withstand frost and afford a rapid re-growth in spring  <cit> . thus, sufficient early root growth is necessary for winter crop survival and may have been selected for based on yield in previous breeding programs, whereas spring sown crops have less need for a rapid development to ensure hardiness.fig.  <dig> root traits of brassica napus grown in a ‘pouch and wick’ system. data are means of up to  <dig> genotypes, including winter osr , spring osr , semiwinter osr , winter fodder  and swede  habits. boxes represent the mid two quartiles with the median drawn; whiskers are the 95 % confidence limits plus extremes. panels a–f represent different root traits




spring varieties typically had higher leaf concentrations of macronutrients and some micronutrients than winter varieties
the mean leaf concentration of  <dig> elements varied by more than six orders of magnitude across genotypes, from  <dig>  mg kg− <dig>  to > <dig>  mg kg− <dig>  . genotypic variation in leaf mineral concentration ranged from  <dig> -fold  to >40-fold . among the macronutrients, leaf mineral concentrations varied  <dig> -fold for p,  <dig> -fold for k,  <dig> -fold for ca,  <dig> -fold for mg, and  <dig> -fold variation in s. in comparison, among a panel of ~ <dig> b. oleracea, also grown in compost and sampled during early vegetative growth, shoot concentrations of: ca and mg varied  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold  <cit> , respectively; p and k varied  <dig> -  <cit>  and  <dig> -fold  <cit> , respectively. among a panel of soil-grown  <dig> inbred lines of b. napus, the shoot mineral concentrations of  <dig> d old seedlings varied   <dig> -fold for ca,  <dig> -fold for mg,  <dig> -fold for p and  <dig> -fold for k  <cit> .fig.  <dig> leaf mineral concentrations of brassica napus grown in compost. data are means of up to  <dig> genotypes, including winter osr , spring osr , semiwinter osr , winter fodder  and swede  habits. boxes represent the mid two quartiles with the median drawn; whiskers are the 95 % confidence limits plus extremes




winter osr, winter fodder and swede had lower mean leaf macronutrient  concentrations than spring and semiwinter osr . semiwinter osr also had higher mean leaf ca and mg concentrations compared to other habits . among the micronutrients, leaf cu was greater in spring osr than other habits . leaf fe concentrations were greater in winter and spring osr . the mean leaf mo concentrations were greatest in spring osr and swede , although there was substantial variation within crop type. the mean leaf concentrations of beneficial and non-essential elements  were consistently higher in the semiwinter osr leaves used in this study, typically followed by spring osr . likewise, in the study of bus et al.  <cit> , winter osr also had lower mean shoot ca, k and s concentrations than spring and semiwinter osr, but similar p concentrations and semiwinter osr had the highest shoot s and zn of the crop types. despite these overall trends in the data, there is wide variation in shoot mineral composition within all crop types of b. napus, which will be influenced strongly by the nutritional environment in which the plant is grown as well as genotypic factors.

variance components analysis  shows that genotype had the largest influence on leaf s concentration  and the smallest influence on leaf se concentrations . habit accounted for the least variation in all traits  but had the greatest effect on leaf na, mg and s concentration. the trends of heritabilities  for leaf composition traits follow a similar pattern to those observed previously in soil grown leaves of arabidopsis  <cit> , whereby leaf mg was the most heritable macro nutrient in their study, and the second most heritable in this study. leaf ca, k and mo concentration were ranked among the most heritable leaf composition traits in both studies. leaf fe, mn and cu concentration were among the least heritable traits in both studies. the variance components analysis indicates that the effect of experimental variance is generally higher for micronutrients than macronutrients.

seed mineral concentrations were consistent across habits for many nutrients, but s concentrations were lower and mo concentrations were higher in osr types
the mean seed concentration of  <dig> elements varied by more than six orders of magnitude across genotypes, from  <dig>  mg kg− <dig>  to > <dig>  mg kg− <dig>  . genotypic variation in seed mineral concentration varied  <dig> -fold  to 14-fold . among the macronutrients, seed mineral concentrations varied  <dig> -fold for ca,  <dig> -fold for mg,  <dig> -fold for k, and  <dig> -fold for s. we are not aware of previous reports of species-wide variation in seed mineral composition traits in a brassica species. white and broadley  <cit>  reviewed variation in the mineral composition of edible cereal grains and dicot seeds for several species, typically core germplasm collections, which had been grown under comparative conditions. among the dicots, seed ca concentration varied  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> - and  <dig> -fold, and seed mg concentration varied  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -,  <dig> -, and  <dig> -fold, for chickpea, peanut, pea, bean and soybean, respectively. therefore, the seed macronutrient composition of this b. napus panel appears to be a similar range as other dicot species.fig.  <dig> seed mineral concentrations of brassica napus grown in compost. data are means of up to  <dig> genotypes, including winter osr , spring osr , semiwinter osr , winter fodder  and swede  habits. boxes represent the mid two quartiles with the median drawn; whiskers are the 95 % confidence limits plus extremes




winter and spring osr had similar seed macronutrient concentrations, except for p, in which spring and semiwinter osr had higher seed p concentrations than winter types  and mg in which the semiwinter had higher concentrations than other types . winter fodder and swede had higher seed s concentrations than osr crop types , presumably due to the smaller proportion of “double-low”  compared to “double-high” varieties, because winter fodder and swede have not been selected for low seed glucosinolate concentration. glucosinolates are sulphur and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites common in the brassicaceae family  <cit> , and some genes of the sulphate assimilation pathway are members of the glucosinolate biosynthetic network  <cit> . seed mo concentrations showed the opposite pattern, with higher concentrations in osr than other types . an antagonistic effect of sulphate on mo concentration in the shoot, root and seeds of osr has previously been observed  <cit> . given that s and mo are known to share some assimilation and transport pathways  <cit> , this could imply a relationship between seed glucosinolates, s and mo. it has previously been suggested that tissue specific demand can regulate the expression of sulphate transporters  <cit> . it could be surmised that plants with low seed s/glucosinolates display a slightly different sulphate transporter profile leading to differences in mo accumulation. nevertheless, how s and mo are interacting in relation to glucosinolates is yet to be determined. consistent with s/mo transport being under strong genetic control, variance components analysis  showed that genotype had the largest influence on seed mo concentration  out of all the elements analysed in this study. as observed previously in arabidopsis seeds  <cit> , mo, cu, s and k concentrations were influenced by genotype to a greater extent than seed mg and p concentrations. of the micronutrients, seed b, cu and mn concentrations were generally consistent across habits; b was highest in spring osr , cu was highest in winter fodder and winter osr , mn was highest in semiwinter osr . zn concentrations were the highest in winter fodder , cd concentrations were highest in semiwinter osr , and seed na concentrations were highest in spring osr.

differences in nutrient translocation between crop habits can be detected by comparing leaf and seed concentration ratios of elements with potentially similar transport or assimilation pathways
four pairs of elements were selected, for which both leaf and seed concentration data were available, and for which there are reports of shared transport/assimilation pathways. these element pairs are s and mo  <cit> , ca and sr  <cit> , k and rb , and zn and cd  <cit> . the second element of each of these pairs is either not a nutrient, or, for mo, is only required in very small amounts compared to the first element in each pair. the first hypothesis tested was that the ratio of first:second element concentration in leaves is ≫ 1: <dig>  as expected from external nutrient supply and plant requirements. the second hypothesis was that the seed ratio/leaf ratio of elements is >1: <dig>  for example, in the case of s and mo, this would be expressed as  / . a seed ratio/leaf ratio of elements >1: <dig> indicates that the net seed accumulation of the essential, or more abundant, nutrient element, is greater than the non-essential, or less abundant, nutrient. this could be due to selective processes in the source  and/or sink  tissues. as expected, the ratio of first:second element is ≫ 1: <dig> in leaves. for s:mo, the mean of  <dig> genotypes is 15902: <dig> ; for ca:sr 519: <dig> ; for k:rb 3106: <dig> ; for zn:cd 200: <dig> . however, there was considerable variation in the seed/leaf ratio of elements . for s:mo, the differences between habits was most apparent. for the osr habits, most osr genotypes had seed ratio/leaf ratios <1: <dig>  indicating net accumulation of mo in seeds is greater than s in relative terms . in contrast, most swede genotypes and almost half of the winter fodder genotypes had a greater net accumulation of s than mo. this relationship is indicative of a potential link between glucosinolates, s and mo content of seeds but the nature of the interactions between these components has yet to be elucidated and is the focus of current studies on this population. for ca:sr, most genotypes showed slight increase in net accumulation of ca compared to sr in seeds, with swede habits having the highest mean . interestingly, all genotypes showed increased net accumulation of rb in seeds compared to k, with swede habits showing the lowest relative net accumulation of k compared to rb . the reasons for this observation are not clear. for zn:cd, all genotypes showed increased net zn accumulation in seeds compared to cd. this was again greater in swede habits, and also winter fodder; both had greater net accumulation of zn in seeds, compared to cd, than did the osr habits.fig.  <dig> leaf and seed element concentration ratios of brassica napus grown in compost. data are means of up to  <dig> and  <dig> genotypes, for leaf and seed concentrations, respectively, including winter osr , spring osr , semiwinter osr , winter fodder  and swede  habits. boxes represent the mid two quartiles with the median drawn; whiskers are the 95 % confidence limits plus extremes. ratios are calculated, e.g. for ca:sr, as  / . panels a–d represent different element pairs




root traits and leaf and seed mineral composition traits correlate within, but not between tissues
there were strong correlations between root traits. the strongest positive correlations were between traits relating directly to the total length of the root system  and also between these traits and lrn . there was a weak negative relationship between prl and lrd , since the latter is derived from lrn/prl. in addition, there was also a weak negative relationship between mlrl and lrd , suggesting a trade-off between lateral root length and number. these correlations are consistent with previous observations on a much smaller panel, of  <dig> uk-field adapted osr genotypes, grown in the same ‘pouch and wick’ system  <cit> . there were many strong positive correlations between the leaf concentrations of pairs of elements . the strongest positive relationships were between leaf concentrations of ca and sr , sr and ba , k and rb  and ca and mg ; all p <  <dig> . positive correlations between the leaf concentrations of group ii elements reflect the relative lack of selectivity between these elements during transport within the plant  <cit> . such relationships between ca and mg have been observed previously within-species, including among panels of diverse b. oleracea  <cit> , osr  <cit> , arabidopsis  <cit>  and multi-species datasets  <cit> . the strong positive relationship in the leaf concentration of group i elements k and rb is as expected from previous observation across many species  <cit> . however, the transport of other group i elements is typically much more selective than group ii elements  <cit> . there were few negative relationships between the leaf concentrations of pairs of elements , but weak negative relationships were observed between rb and the group ii elements, ba , sr , and ca ; all p <  <dig> .fig.  <dig> pair-wise correlations of all  <dig> traits; tsw and seed yield, root morphology and leaf and seed mineral composition traits in brassica napus genotypes. plants were grown in a ‘pouch and wick’ system  or compost . correlation coefficients are scaled from - <dig>   to + <dig>   and are from genotype trait means. traits:  tsw;  seed yield;  root traits:  lrd;  lrl;  lrn;  mlrl;  prl;  trl;  leaf concentration traits:  al;  as;  b;  ba;  ca;  cd;  cs;  cu;  fe;  k;  mg;  mn;  mo;  na;  p;  rb;  s;  se;  sr;  ti;  zn;  seed concentration traits:  b;  ca;  cd;  cu;  k;  li;  mg;  mn;  mo;  na;  p;  rb;  s;  sr;  zn




there were few strong positive correlations between the seed concentrations of pairs of elements . the strongest positive correlation was between ca and sr , followed by between k and rb . both of these correlations were much weaker than those observed in leaves. the strongest negative correlations between the seed concentrations of pairs of elements were between s and mo , s and b , and ca and k ; all p <  <dig>  .

in general, leaf and seed mineral composition traits correlated very weakly . the strongest positive correlation in a compositional trait between plant parts was a positive correlation between leaf cd and seed cd . all other correlations between leaf and seed mineral composition traits, and between root traits and leaf or seed composition traits were weaker, with correlation coefficients ranging from - <dig>  to + <dig> . likewise, with the exception of p, no correlations were observed between elemental concentrations of leaf, root and seed tissues in arabidopsis  <cit> .

the strongest positive correlations between a seedling root trait and a leaf composition trait were between lrd and leaf ca , sr  and ba  concentrations. a similar weak positive correlation between seedling lrd and leaf ca  concentrations was also seen previously in some field experiments  <cit> . interestingly, prl had weak, but significant, negative correlations with most leaf composition traits e.g. mo  and na . these data provide some evidence that lrd might be a beneficial trait for nutrient resource and above-ground biomass acquisition in b. napus  <cit> . some leaf and seed mineral concentrations e.g. ca and mg and some beneficial elements  of semiwinter osr genotypes were greater than in other habits . semiwinter osr genotypes used as starting material for this study had the greatest lrd and greatest mean tsw of the five crop habits, which may have led to improved overall root size and function, and mineral acquisition in this study . semiwinter types are likely to have a distinct breeding history from winter and spring osr habits due to having more introgressions from b. rapa and a longer period of domestication  <cit> . these differences in pedigree might also explain some of the variation in root and shoot traits assigned in this present study to crop habit, and warrant further study in a range of environments.

combining root, leaf and seed traits in a discriminant analysis is characteristic of crop habit
combining all traits within the discriminant analysis provided the most accurate characterisation of crop habit . using the variate set of all traits combined, and after the addition of the  <dig> most informative trait variate sets, genotypes with the winter , spring  and semiwinter  osr habits were correctly allocated to the correct group, as were 76 % of swede and 68 % of the winter fodder habits. the trait which contributed the most in terms of allocation to crop habit was leaf s concentration, followed by prl, and seed ca and mo concentration, followed by the tsw of the  <dig> seed from which plants were grown. the next most important root trait after prl was mlrl, which was ranked 12th. the relative contributions of all  <dig> traits in this variate set to the discriminant analysis are presented in additional file 1: table s <dig>  the discriminant analyses for each of the root-, leaf- and seed-trait variate sets was less accurate .fig.  <dig> step-wise discriminant analysis using the variate set of all  <dig> traits; root morphology, tsw and seed yield and leaf and seed mineral composition traits combined. a specificity plot showing the proportion of genotypes of each ‘crop habit’ correctly allocated to each group, at each step of the discriminant analysis;  discrimination plots drawn to represent the distribution of ‘crop habits’ in two dimensional variance space. ‘crop habit’ means , 95 % confidence circles  and group polygons enclosing all units for each crop habit are indicated




CONCLUSIONS

brassica napus has been shown to be amenable to rapid marker identification linked to useful agronomic traits in wide diversity populations. for example, using associative transcriptomics  with a panel of  <dig> b. napus genotypes from within the same panel used here, harper et al.  <cit>  showed that seed contents of both erucic acid and glucosinolates  were associated with specific genes known to be involved in their biosynthetic pathways, whilst identifying additional new target loci of potential use in breeding. similarly, koprivova et al.  <cit>  used a subset of this study’s population to identify novel loci linked to shoot anion accumulation. the at technique is based on transcriptome-sequencing, combined with association mapping. it uses transcribed sequences  which allows variation of gene sequences to be detected  whilst reducing the complexity of the analysis compared to typical genome-wide association analysis . in addition, transcript abundance  can be quantified simultaneously. transcript abundance is likely to be of particular relevance in the control of traits in complex polyploid species in which gene duplication may lead to unequal expression of gene paralogues  <cit> .

a substantial proportion of the same inbred population used in this study have also been used to study other traits, including those relating to nutritional composition and seedling growth, in other environments  and those based on leaf ionome traits . the most accurate characterisation of crop habit is when multiple plant part traits are combined in analysis. thus, combining multiple datasets using this panel has the potential for more accurate candidate trait identification, and to dissect the transport pathways which lead to altered elemental accumulation for crop improvement. the volume and throughput of data obtained from root phenotyping and ionomics platforms is considerable and the challenge now is to combine datasets for a better understanding of the ionome and the key traits involved in elemental accumulation, and to mine for the underlying molecular mechanisms of these useful traits using associative transcriptomics analysis.
