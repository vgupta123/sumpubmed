BACKGROUND
a metallopeptidase is a proteolytic enzyme that has one or two metal ions as an integral part of its catalytic machinery located within the active site. there are many families of metallopeptidases that bind a single zinc ion required for catalysis. the zinc ion is tetrahedrally co-ordinated by three residues from the peptidase and a water molecule that becomes activated to be the nucleophile in the catalytic reaction. in many of these families, but not all, the residues that ligate the zinc ion  are two histidines within an hexxh motif, and a third coordinating residue that is c-terminal to this motif, which can be a glutamic acid, a histidine or an aspartic acid. metallopeptidases with an hexxh motif are known as zincins. in a metallopeptidase such as thermolysin, the third zinc ligand is usually a glutamic acid, and these peptidases are known as glu-zincins. in a metallopeptidase such as matrix metallopeptidase  <dig> , the zinc ligands are the three histidines within an hexxhxxgxxh motif. in mmp <dig> there is also an important region known as the met-turn, in which there is a conserved methionine that structurally supports the active site. for this reason, metallopeptidases such as mmp <dig> are known as met-zincins
 <cit> . in some zincins the third zinc ligand may be an aspartic acid , and there is no met-turn; these peptidases are known as asp-zincins
 <cit> . all of the zincins share structural similarities and in the merops classification and database, the different families that can be recognized by sequence similarities are all included in clan ma. this clan is subdivided into three subclans. subclan ma containing the glu-zincins, subclan ma containing the met-zincins and subclan ma containing the asp-zincins
 <cit> .

a zincin structure contains at least two subdomains: an n-terminal subdomain which includes the hexxh motif, and a c-terminal subdomain that includes the third zinc ligand. the active site is therefore between the two subdomains. within the zincins, the size of the c-terminal subdomain varies enormously, from being large in the matrix metallopeptidases , to being just a single helix, which is the case for snapalysin from streptomyces lividans , which has one of the smallest sequences and structures in the clan
 <cit> .

very recently, a minimal structure for a glu-zincin has been determined
 <cit> , representing the smallest known member of this subclan so far discovered. no catalytic activity could be detected. the family has been provisionally assigned the name m <dig>  but will not appear in the merops database until peptidase activity has been experimentally confirmed. lenart et al. <cit>  identified a number of protein families in which an hexxh motif was conserved. one of these families was pfam family pf <dig> , which includes atleast  <dig> sequences from bacteria. members of this family have the asp-zincin-like motif hexxhxxgxxd. in this paper, we report the structure of a member of this family: the acel_ <dig> protein from acidothermus cellulolyticus, a cellulolytic thermophile found in hot springs
 <cit> . the domain architecture represents a minimal structure for a zincin, with very little sequence beyond the third zinc ligand and an absence of the met-turn.

methods
protein expression and purification
the american type culture collection  provided the genomic dna used to clone acel_ <dig> . protein production and crystallization of the acel_ <dig> protein was carried out by standard jcsg protocols
 <cit> . clones were generated using the polymerase incomplete primer extension  cloning method
 <cit> . the gene encoding acel_ <dig>  was synthesized with codons optimized for escherichia coli expression  and cloned into plasmid pspeedet, which encodes an expression and purification tag followed by a tobacco etch virus  protease cleavage site  at the amino terminus of the full-length protein. escherichia coli genehogs  competent cells were transformed and dispensed on selective lb-agar plates. the cloning junctions were confirmed by dna sequencing. expression was performed in a selenomethionine-containing medium at 37°c. selenomethionine was incorporated via inhibition of methionine biosynthesis
 <cit> , which does not require a methionine auxotrophic strain. at the end of fermentation, lysozyme was added to the culture to a final concentration of 250 μg/ml, and the cells were harvested and frozen. after one freeze/thaw cycle the cells were homogenized in lysis buffer  and passed through a microfluidizer . the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at  <dig>  x g for 30 minutes and loaded onto a nickel-chelating resin  pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, the resin was washed with wash buffer , and the protein was eluted with elution buffer . the eluate was buffer exchanged with tev buffer  using a pd- <dig> column , and incubated with 1 mg of tev protease per 15 mg of eluted protein for 2 hours at 20°–25°c followed by overnight at 4°c. the protease-treated eluate was passed over nickel-chelating resin  pre-equilibrated with hepes crystallization buffer  and the resin was washed with the same buffer. the flow-through and wash fractions were combined and concentrated to  <dig>  mg/ml by centrifugal ultrafiltration  for crystallization trials.

protein crystallization
the acel_ <dig> protein was crystallized using the nanodroplet vapor diffusion method
 <cit>  with standard jcsg crystallization protocols
 <cit> . sitting drops composed of 100 nl protein solution mixed with 100 nl crystallization solution in a sitting drop format were equilibrated against a 50 μl reservoir at 277 k for 72 days prior to harvest. the crystallization reagent consisted of 24% polyethylene glycol  <dig>   <dig>  m calcium acetate,  <dig>  m mes ph  <dig> . glycerol was added to a final concentration of 20%  as a cryoprotectant. initial screening for diffraction was carried out using the stanford automated mounting system 
 <cit>  at the stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource . data were collected at  <dig> wavelengths corresponding to the inflection, high remote and peak energy of a selenium mad  experiment at 100 k using a marccd  <dig> detector  at stanford synchrotron radiation lightsource  beamline 9_ <dig>  data processing was carried out using xds

 <cit>  pre-calibrated with gel filtration standards . the mobile phase consisted of 20 mm tris ph  <dig> , 150 mm nacl, and  <dig> %  sodium azide. the apparent molecular weight was calculated using the bio-rad gel filtration standard set  and a linear regression of log10mw.

RESULTS
structure description
the crystal structure of the acel_ <dig> protein was determined to  <dig>  Å resolution using the mad phasing method. atomic coordinates and experimental structure factors to  <dig>  Å resolution  have been deposited in the protein data bank . data-collection, model and refinement statistics are summarized in table 
 <dig>  the final model includes two protein molecules , two acetate molecules, two  calcium ions and  <dig> water molecules in the asymmetric unit. the calcium ions are near the centre of the dimer interface, and may be important for dimerization. the calcium ions are coordinated by asp <dig>  glu <dig> and via waters by glu <dig>  no zinc was found in the structure, either because little zinc was present during purification and crystallization, the enzyme is in latent state or the protein is not an enzyme. the matthews coefficient  is  <dig>  Å3/da and the estimated solvent content is  <dig> %. the ramachandran plot produced by molprobity <cit>  shows that  <dig> % of the residues are in favoured regions, with no outliers. the side-chain atoms of glu <dig>  asp <dig>  glu <dig> and glu <dig> on chain a and glu <dig>  glu <dig> and glu <dig> on chain b had poor electron density and were omitted from the model. for monomer a, the structure is composed of four helices, two  <dig> helices and three beta strands . in monomer b, the n-terminus forms a fourth strand and the dimer is formed from this strand inserting into the beta sheet of monomer a.

the acel_ <dig> protein was crystallized as a dimer, with the putative active sites at opposite ends of the dimer. pisa analysis of the structure indicates that the solvent-excluded surface area for the proposed dimer is ~639 Å <dig>  from size exclusion chromatography, the molecular weight of the acel_ <dig> protein in solution is estimated to be  <dig> , which is a ratio of  <dig>  over the expected molecular weight of the monomer  indicating that the protein exists as a dimer .

the crystal structure of acel_ <dig> protein has a minimal zincin-like fold because it retains a three-stranded mixed beta-sheet , the loops are much shorter and the overall sequence length of all members of this family  is significantly shorter than the average for a matrix metalloprotease -like domain . the distant homology prediction program ffas
 <cit>  recognizes this similarity, with a marginal statistical significance , suggesting that duf <dig> family is distantly related to metalloproteases.

there is no signal peptide, and the acel_ <dig> protein is presumably intracellular.

putative active site
from the presence of the hexxhxxgxxd motif, the potential zinc ligands in the acel_ <dig> protein are predicted to be his <dig>  his <dig> and asp <dig>  and glu <dig> is predicted to be a catalytic residue. in the crystal structure , the glu <dig> is hydrogen-bonded to five water molecules in both monomers. conservation of the active site residues is shown in figure 
 <dig>  of the two active sites in both monomers a and b, the one in b is empty and the other in a is occupied by a single water molecule which is coordinated by his <dig> , his <dig>  and asp <dig> , exactly where the zinc ion would be expected to be. delphi calculations show that the entire pocket is very acidic. there are five negatively charged residues, plus the carboxyl group from the c-terminus in that area. the surface electrostatic potential is shown in figure 
 <dig>  the molecule is negatively charged overall , with a theoretical pi calculated to be  <dig> . this may be an adaptation to the acidic hot spring environment in which acidothermus cellulolyticus lives.

in the acel_ <dig> protein, and other members of the family, the hexxh motif is very close to the c-terminus. like glu- and asp-zincins, there is no met-turn. the first his  of the hexxh motif exists in two conformations in monomer b. in the more stable conformation, his <dig> is electrostatically bound to the carboxyl group of the c-terminal residue . this is the situation also found in monomer a, so it is possible that the water  only bind when his <dig> and tyr <dig> interact. the structure of the acel_ <dig> protein was superimposed upon that of the reprolysin bap <dig> peptidase from the snake bothrops asper  and this clearly shows that tyr <dig> occupies a similar position to the methionine of the met-turn in the bap <dig> peptidase . so although there is no met-turn, tyr <dig> may compensate for it.

sequence similarities
over  <dig> homologues of the acel_ <dig> protein were found from the blastp search. in  <dig> of these proteins, the hexxhxxgxxd motif is not conserved. the third zinc ligand has been replaced in many of these homologues, often with glutamic acid, which is the third zinc ligand in glu-zincins.

all of the homologues are from bacteria belonging to seven different phyla. most homologues come from species in the phylum firmicutes , which are gram-positive bacteria. there are  <dig> homologues from species in the phylum proteobacteria, fourteen from chloroflexi, five from planctomycetes, three from verrucomicrobia, and one each from species in the phyla caldiserica and nitrospirae. most species have only one homologue, but stigmatella aurantiaca has two, though only one has the third zinc ligand conserved.

the different pfam domain architectures for members of this family are shown in figure 
 <dig>  the vast majority of homologues have the simple domain architecture of the acel_ <dig> protein. seventeen homologues include tetratricopeptide repeats , which mediate protein-protein interactions and the assembly of multiprotein complexes
 <cit> . a tpr repeat motif consists of several tandem repeats of a 34-residue sequence. eight proteins with tpr repeats are predicted to have signal peptides and are presumably secreted. a homologue from mycobacterium tuberculosis possesses an n-terminal transmembrane domain and a domain found in proteins known to be important for septum formation during spore formation
 <cit> .

structural similarities
amongst known metallopeptidases, dali analysis shows that the acel_ <dig> protein structure is most similar to that of a met-zincin from the archaean methanocorpusculum labreanum . the acel_ <dig> protein structure is also similar to the carboxy-terminal domain  of escherischia coli htpg/hsp <dig> protein, which is a chaperone protein. this c-terminal domain is important for dimerization, but the mechanism of dimerization via the c-terminal helices is completely different to that of the acel_ <dig> dimer. two of the helices and the beta sheet can be superimposed, and the beta strands run in the same direction. the relationship between hsp <dig> and a zincin has not previously been recognized in either the scop
 <cit>  or cath
 <cit>  databases, and suggests a common evolutionary origin. these structural relationships cover the entire acel_ <dig> protein sequence.

the met-turn is important in all met-zincins because the methionine is crucial for structurally stabilizing the active site. even in snapalysins from streptomyces, which also have short sequences, there is a conserved methionine approximately ten residues c-terminal to the third zinc ligand. in the acel_ <dig> protein although there are no residues that correspond to the c-terminal  <dig> residues of the archaemetzincin, which includes the essential met <dig>  the c-terminal tyr <dig> occupies a similar position to the methionine. although it is tempting to suggest that this tyrosine performs a similar role, it should be noted that the tyrosine is present in only  <dig> homologues in the family and replaced by tryptophan in a further  <dig> homologues and by phenylalanine in a homologue from rhodococcus sp. aw25m <dig>  in a further  <dig> homologues, the full-length sequence falls short of tyr <dig>  in astacin, a tyrosine  has been shown to be an important residue, contributing to transition state binding, which can be replaced with much reduced efficiency by phenylalanine
 <cit> . if proven to be a peptidase, the acel_ <dig> protein and its homologues would form family m <dig> in merops.

the structure of another putative metallopeptidase, the ttha <dig> protein from thermus thermophilus , is similar. the ttha <dig> protein is also a dimer but has been crystallized with a single magnesium ion, and the structure also lacks any zinc ions. this is also an acidic protein with a theoretical pi calculated to be  <dig> . the ttha <dig> protein also contains the asp-zincin metal-binding motif, and the potential zinc coordinating residues are his <dig>  his <dig> and asp <dig>  chain a is shorter at the c-terminus, lacking residues 109– <dig>  which means that the third zinc ligand is missing. the putative catalytic residue is glu <dig>  there is a four-residue insert preceding the essential glycine . in chain a, the final helix is continuous, whereas in chain b, there is a turn and there are two, opposing helices. this second helix does not superimpose with the final helix in the 3e <dig> structure, because it is pointing in the opposite direction so that the faces of the helices that oppose each other in 2ejq are different from those in 3e <dig> .

there are several orthologues of the ttha <dig> protein which have the insert within the asp-zincin motif. in the homologues from oceanithermus profundus and meiothermus ruber the glycine , which in met-zincins is important for the turn that permits the zinc ligands to face one another, is replaced by tryptophan. it had been thought that only a glycine was acceptable in this position
 <cit> , although several bacterial homologues of pappalysin, family m <dig>  have asparagine at this position, including a homologue from methanosarcina acetivorans for which the crystal structure has been solved
 <cit> , and a homologue from cytophaga hutchinsonii  has threonine at this position. comparisons of the structural topologies of various met-zincins and the mini-glu-zincin are shown in figure 
 <dig> 

the structure of the acel_ <dig> protein represents the minimum sequence known for a zincin domain. the question remains: is this a situation that has developed within this family, or is it a relic of the ancestral zincin gene? one way to answer this question is to look at the species distribution of peptidases from the various families in the clan. table 
 <dig> shows the phyletic distribution of all families within clan ma. the number of phyla within each of the three superkingdoms  containing at least one homologue within each family is shown. amongst the glu-zincins, families m <dig>  m <dig>  m <dig> and m <dig> are widely distributed in phyla from all three superkingdoms . the mini-glu-zincins, from family m <dig>  have a much narrower distribution and are absent from eukaryotes. these observations imply that the last common universal ancestor most likely possessed a homologue from each of these families, and that the larger glu-zincin structure is the ancestral state. the distribution of asp- and met-zincins is more restricted in all families, and the only family that is well represented in all domains of life is family m <dig>  the archaelysins. there are homologues from archaea , bacteria  and eukaryotes , though these are found in less than half of the bacterial and eukaryote phyla. it is likely that an archaelysin most closely represents the ancestral met-zincin structure. archaelysin possesses the met-turn
 <cit> , so the implication is that the met-turn has been lost from an ancestor of family m <dig> and functionally replaced by a c-terminal aromatic residue . the much narrower distribution of members of m <dig> supports the hypothesis that the family is a more recent development.

CONCLUSIONS
the acel_ <dig> protein from acidothermus cellulolyticus is a protein of unknown function, but was predicted to be a metallopeptidase from the presence of a motif  conserved amongst the asp-zincins, which contain a single, catalytic zinc ion ligated by the histidines and aspartic acid within the motif. the tertiary structure of the acel_ <dig> protein was determined by the joint center for structural genomics, and confirmed the presence of a single, zincin-like metallopeptidase-like domain. in our crystallographic model there are two molecules in the asymmetric unit and from size-exclusion chromatography, the protein dimerizes in solution. a water molecule is present in the putative zinc-binding site in one monomer, which is replaced by one of two observed conformations of his <dig> in the other. the c-terminal tyr <dig> may be important for stabilizing the putative active site. additional experimentation would be required to prove that the acel_ <dig> protein is a metallopeptidase.

although the acel_ <dig> protein is structurally related to the zincins, it contains the minimum structural features of a member of this protein superfamily, and can be described as a “mini- zincin”. there is a striking parallel with the structure of a mini-glu-zincin, which represents the minimum structure of a glu-zincin . rather than being an ancestral state, phylogenetic analysis suggests that the mini-zincins are derived from larger proteins.

crystal structure of the ttha <dig> protein from thermus thermophilus. the pdb entry 2ejq is a dimer, and because different elements are missing from both monomers, the structure of both monomers is shown. chain a is shown in beige, chain b in cyan. residues described below and in the text are labelled and shown as sticks. the monomers differ in terms of the residues that cannot be resolved. chain a lacks the c-terminal residues asp109-gly <dig>  and chain b lacks residues pro54-leu <dig> as well as the c-terminal gly-glu-gly residues. also in 2ejq, asp <dig> is too far away from the other potential zinc ligands to be a ligand itself. there are other potential zinc ligands in residues 110– <dig>  including glu <dig>  asp <dig>  and asp <dig>  only asp <dig> is close enough to the imidazolium rings of the histidines to act as the third zinc ligand. unfortunately, this asp <dig> is poorly conserved, whereas asp <dig> is well conserved. because asp <dig> and the final helix are close to the dimer interface, the structure here may be distorted because of the dimerization.
