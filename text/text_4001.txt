BACKGROUND
cellular protein homeostasis is regulated by molecular chaperones  <cit> . chaperonins are a subfamily of chaperones which have diverged into two distinct groups  <cit> . group i chaperonins, which are found in prokaryotes and in organelles of prokaryotic origin, include groel/es in e. coli, hsp60/ <dig> in mitochondria, and cpn60/ <dig> in chloroplasts . group ii chaperonins are further divided into archaeal types  and eukaryotic types   <cit> . both chaperonin groups share a similar molecular architecture consisting of two back-to-back stacked rings, with a central cavity in each ring that allows substrates to fold. the structure of group i chaperonin groel/es is well established  and the mitochondrial hsp60/ <dig> crystal structure has been recently solved  <cit> . both chaperonins are cylindrical structures consisting of  <dig> identical subunits assembled into two heptameric rings. the crystal structures of groel in its various forms , groel mutants, and mini-chaperones have facilitated the understanding of its functional mechanism. even the structure of mini-chaperones, which were solved in high resolution, provided details of side chains which are involved in the interaction or regulation with other proteins or molecules . each of the  <dig> individual subunits of the chaperonins has three domains: the apical, the equatorial, and the intermediate hinge domains. in groel, the apical domain  residues 189–377) recognizes substrate proteins via hydrophobic residues exposed toward the central cavity and interacts with its co-chaperonin groes  <cit> . the equatorial domain  contains the atp binding site and contributes to inter-ring contacts  <cit> . these two domains are connected by the intermediate hinge domain , which allows rigid body movement.

in the past 20 years, the asymmetric mechanism of groel-assisted folding has been supported, i.e. groes binds to one groel ring  and the two rings function sequentially  <cit> . however, the observation of a symmetric groel-groes <dig> complex, in which both groel rings are capped with groes , leads to the suggestions that the symmetric complexes represent a folding intermediate and that the two groel rings fold polypeptides simultaneously . recently, haldar et al.  <cit>  found that the presence of symmetric groel-groes <dig> complexes was largely dependent on the fluoro-fluorescence pair used to label the chaperonin system and non-foldable substrates. whether a sequential or simultaneous folding mechanism is undertaken by chaperonin in vivo is still under investigation.

chaperonins utilize atp to drive a conformational cycle that allows them to capture, encapsulate, fold, and release substrate proteins  <cit> . binding and hydrolysis of atp induce both positive  and negative cooperative  actions of groel  <cit> . atp hydrolysis also promotes the partial disassembly of chloroplast chaperonin into the monomer  <cit> , a phenomenon specific to chloroplast chaperonin. the chloroplast chaperonin was first identified as a rubisco ‘large subunit binding protein’  <cit> . unlike homo-oligomeric groel and mitochondrial hsp <dig>  chloroplast chaperonin consists of multiple subunits, diverging into two distinct but related α and β types  <cit> . cpn60α does not assemble into tetradecameric oligomers unless incorporated into oligomers of cpn60β subunits  <cit> . though the authentic chloroplast chaperonin consists of both subunit types in vivo, homo-oligomeric cpn60β is functional in refolding model substrates with assistance from co-chaperonin in vitro  <cit> . two highly conserved cpn60β oligomers exhibit significantly different biochemical properties  <cit> , e.g. homo-oligomers of cpn60β <dig>  but not cpn60β <dig>  from chlamydomonas completely disassemble into monomers upon atp hydrolysis. although new information about chloroplast chaperonin is steadily being published, its structure and complicated regulatory mechanism remain unknown.

here, we report the first crystal structure of chloroplast homo-oligomer cpn60β <dig> in its apo form, with a larger molecular diameter than groel and novel atp binding pockets. domain swapping between cpn60α and cpn60β revealed that the equatorial domain mediates oligomer formation and the two subunits are highly cooperative in forming functional oligomers.

RESULTS
homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> bound to co-chaperonins but could not assist folding of model substrate rrrubisco
in chlamydomonas, functional cpn <dig> is composed of three subunits  <cit> . the individual subunits of cpn <dig> from chlamydomonas do not complement groel function in e. coli  <cit> , but it was reported that homo-oligomeric cpn60β is functional in refolding model substrates in vitro  <cit> . to investigate if homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> from chlamydomonas is functional in vitro, we first assessed the interaction between cpn60β <dig> and co-chaperonins by gel filtration. in addition to cpn <dig>  which is similar to groes in size, there is a co-chaperonin, cpn <dig>  which is double the size of groes in chloroplasts  <cit> . both groes and cpn <dig> from chlamydomonas  could in fact form complexes with homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> . furthermore, both ‘bullet’ and ‘football’ structures were observed by electron microscopy after incubation of cpn60β <dig> with groes in the presence of atp-alf <dig>  with ‘football’ structures being prevalent   <cit> . these results indicate that cpn60β <dig> interacted with co-chaperonins. groes and crcpn <dig> did not inhibit the atpase activity of cpn60β <dig> effectively . by contrast, the mitochondrial co-chaperonin hsp <dig> from mouse inhibited atpase activity of cpn60β <dig> by 50 %, which was consistent with effects observed on pscpn60β from pisum sativum  <cit> . unexpectedly, hsp <dig> could not assist homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> in refolding the model substrate rrrubisco , which is contrary to experimental results obtained using pscpn60β  <cit> . in e. coli, the cooperation of cpn60β1/hsp <dig> could partially complement groel/es function . the observations that co-chaperonins bind to homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> and that mitochondrial hsp <dig> partially assists cpn60β <dig> in its chaperonin function suggest that the structure of homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> resembles that of functional hetero-oligomers.fig.  <dig> interaction of homo-oligomeric cpn60β <dig> with co-chaperonin. a analytical gel filtration of cpn60β1-cochaperonin complexes. a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μm cpn60β <dig> and 10 μm co-chaperonins, as indicated, was run on a superdex  <dig> column with buffer containing 50 μm adp-alf <dig>  collected fractions were resolved by sds-page and stained with coomassie. a representative picture from the uv trace of gel filtration is shown in the bottom panel. b electron micrograph of cpn60β <dig> with groes in the presence of atp-alf <dig>  the ‘football’ and ‘bullet’ structures are indicated by yellow and red arrows, respectively. c atpase activity of cpn60β oligomers. the atp hydrolysis rate of  <dig>  μm chaperonin in the presence or absence of  <dig>  μm co-chaperonins was measured for 10 min at 25 °c. the data was obtained with three independent experimental replicates and standard deviations are shown. d functional complementation of groel by cpn60β <dig>  the expression of cpn60β and selected co-chaperonin was induced with 1 mm iptg in groel-deficient e. coli strain, mgm <dig>  the strains were grown on medium supplemented with glucose and iptg at 37 °c for 15 hours



crystal structure of the cpn60β <dig> oligomers
the crystallization of functional hetero-oligomers of cpn <dig> did not succeed, whereas the crystallization of cpn60β <dig> homo-oligomers was achieved by the sandwich method  <cit> . the crystals belong to space group p <dig>  with  <dig> subunits per asymmetric unit. the crystal structure of cpn60β <dig> was solved by molecular replacement with apo groel   <cit>  as a search model. the electron density map was well fitted in the equatorial domain, but some segments in the apical domain were not visible. we fitted the apical domain structure of cpn60β <dig>  to refine the structure. the structural refinement details are listed in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in overall architecture, cpn60β <dig> presents as a typical type i chaperonin, with a 7-fold symmetrical cylinder structure consisting of two stacked rings composed of seven subunits . similar to groel subunits, each cpn <dig> subunit consists of an equatorial, intermediate, and apical domain. however, there are three features that distinguish the chloroplast chaperonin:  the central cavity of cpn <dig> is relatively large; analysis of helices h-i , which reside on the inner surface of the cavity and are involved in both binding polypeptides and interaction with co-chaperonin  <cit> , revealed that the diameter of the central cavity of cpn60β <dig> oligomer is 6 Å larger than that of groel .  the structure of cpn60β <dig> is loosely compacted; a closer view revealed that the equatorial domain of cpn60β <dig> extends away from the central axis, with e <dig>  and e <dig>  domains rotating counterclockwise and clockwise, respectively, in comparison to the equatorial domain of groel, although the overall structures merged well . these observations indicate a looser compaction of cpn60β <dig> relative to groel. the inter-subunit interface area in the same ring was calculated by the pisa program  <cit> . the area between two subunits in cpn60β <dig> is  <dig>  Å <dig>  less than 10 % that in groel . furthermore, we counted the amino acids involved in inter-subunit contacts carefully by setting the distance of atoms from different chains to less than 4 Å . the number of amino acids involved in contacts in one cpn60β <dig> subunit is much less than that in one groel subunit, especially in the apical domain. close inspection of inter-subunits in the apical domain of groel revealed that there are seven amino acids in one subunit and five amino acids in the adjacent subunit involved in contacts. on the other hand, there are only two amino acids in one cpn <dig> subunit and two amino acids in the adjacent subunit involved in contacts. all these amino acids are listed in the supplementary data . weaker associations between subunits may explain the enhanced protease sensitivity of the cpn60β <dig> homo-oligomer relative to groel  <cit> .  finally, cpn60β <dig> resembles the allosteric intermediate state. superimposing single rings of cpn60β <dig> and apo groel revealed that the conformation of cpn60β <dig> resembled the intermediate state between apo groel   <cit>  and groel-adp   <cit>  . between α-carbon atoms of cpn60β <dig> and groel-apo , the root-mean-square deviation was computed as  <dig>  Å, and  <dig>  Å between α-carbon atoms of groel-adp  and groel-apo . further evidence comes from the position of e <dig>  in the cpn60β <dig> apo state, e <dig> is in an intermediate state and shifts less dramatically during allosteric movement , which could account for the influence of the apical domain on atp turnover  <cit> .fig.  <dig> x-ray crystal structures of cpn60β <dig> oligomers. a the side view of the crystal structure perpendicular to the axis of the oligomeric cylinder  and top view parallel to the axis of the oligomeric cylinder . individual subunits are designated by different colors. estimated structural dimensions are indicated. b comparison of the structures of cpn60β <dig> oligomer versus groel. position of helix h to helix i is colored in pink in cpn60β <dig> and yellow in groel  to show the size of the central cavity. the diameter of the central cavities is indicated in the top images. the position of helix k to helix l is highlighted with pink in cpn60β <dig> and yellow in groel . c the bottom view of e <dig> and e <dig> domains from the upper single ring. cpn60β <dig> is colored in pink and groel in yellow. d numbers of amino acids involved in the inter- and intra-ring contacts within one subunit. a contact was defined as an atomic distance between two amino acids of less than 4 Å. the number of amino acids in each domain is shown;  <dig> amino acids  in the equatorial domain are involved in inter-ring contacts. e position of e <dig> in different conformations. the groel apo state, the cpn60β <dig> apo state, and groel-adp state are colored in yellow, pink, and orange, respectively



an enlarged atp binding pocket
we have reported that the atpase activity of chloroplast chaperonin is 2- to 3-fold greater than that of groel and that co-chaperonin inhibits chloroplast chaperonin atpase activity less substantially than groel. both of these aspects may have evolved to optimally cope with the burden of folding extensive amounts of rubisco  <cit> . therefore, we curiously compared the atp binding pocket of cpn60β <dig> and apo groel . the atp binding pocket in cpn60β <dig> is wider, suggesting that adenosine may be more readily released. during groel allosteric progress, n <dig> and s <dig> in the intermediate domain close the adenosine binding pocket by interacting with k <dig> and p <dig> in the equatorial domain of groel-adp or groel-groes-adp states, and the contacts are tighter in the groel-groes-adp conformation  <cit>  . in cpn60β, positions  <dig> and  <dig> are occupied by glycine residues that have no side chains to aid closure of the atp binding pocket upon co-chaperonin binding. to investigate the influence of side chains of these two amino acids during allosteric movement, we checked the co-chaperonin inhibitory effect on recombinantly purified double mutant chaperonin . groes inhibited the atpase activity of the double mutant groel  less significantly than groel . it is worth noting that the atpase activity of groel  is higher than groel. bioinformatic analysis revealed that glycine is conserved at position  <dig> in more than  <dig> cpn <dig> proteins, suggesting that loose closure of the adenosine binding pocket may be a defining characteristic of cpn60s that accounts for the weak inhibitory effect of co-chaperonins  <cit> . when the two glycines in cpn60β <dig> were mutated to the corresponding amino acids of groel, the resulting mutant cpn60β <dig>  had much lower atpase activity, which did not further decrease in the presence of co-chaperonin crcpns . in contrast to groel, the non-hydrolyzable atp analogue amp-pnp did not promote binding of groes to cpn60β <dig> , and also did not induce cpn60β <dig> to move allosterically , reinforcing that the atp binding pocket in cpn <dig> is distinct.fig.  <dig> the atp binding pocket in chaperonins. a surface representation of atp binding pocket in chaperonin oligomers. the atp binding pockets are marked with yellow dashed lines and positive and negative amino acids in oligomers are colored in blue and red, respectively. b comparison of atp binding pockets in various conformations. n <dig> and k <dig> are colored in dark purple, and s <dig> and p <dig> are colored with light purple. c the inhibitory effect of co-chaperonin on atpase activities of chaperonin and its mutant. the inhibitory effect of co-chaperonin groes on groel and its mutant, or crcpns  on cpn60β <dig> and its mutant. the data was obtained with three independent experimental replicates and standard deviations are shown. d interaction of chaperonin with groes in the presence of amp-pnp by gel filtration. a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 2 μm chaperonin and 10 μm groes was separated on a superdex  <dig> column with buffer containing 50 μm amp-pnp. collected fractions were resolved by sds-page and stained with coomassie



the equatorial domain directs the oligomer formation
cpn60β, but not cpn60α, forms oligomers  <cit> . to investigate the elements that influence chaperonin assembly, we constructed a series of chimeras with domains swapped between cpn60α and cpn60β <dig> . all chimeric proteins were induced to substantial amounts , but the proteins tended to aggregate in chimeras with equatorial fragments originating from two different cpn <dig> subunits , indicating that certain interactions were disturbed. when the entire equatorial domain of cpn60β <dig>  was present, the chimeras assembled into oligomers independent of the origin of the intermediate domains . the results were further confirmed by chimeras m and n, in which the cpn60β <dig> segments in h and l were changed to cpn60β <dig> segments . consistent with the biochemical properties of individual homo-oligomers, i.e. cpn60β <dig> disassembles into monomer upon atp hydrolysis while cpn60β <dig> does not  <cit> , chimeras h, l, m, and n behaved like their non-chimeric counterparts containing the same equatorial domain . these results indicate that the equatorial domain not only directs oligomer formation but also responds to atp hydrolysis.fig.  <dig> segments influencing oligomer assembly and functionality. a diagram of cpn <dig> subunits and the constructed chaperonin chimeras of cpn60s. domain designation and amino acid numbering were used with respect to groel. e <dig> domain , i <dig> domain , a , i <dig> , e <dig> . b solubility and oligomeric states of chaperonin chimeras. whole cell lysate  from 1 ml of induced cells were resolved with 12 % sds-page. the soluble fractions were separated with 12 % sds page and 6 % native page. purified cpn60α monomer, cpn60β <dig> oligomer, and uninduced cell lysate  were loaded as controls. proteins were visualized by coomassie staining. the positions of oligomers and monomers are indicated by an arrow and *, respectively. c oligomer formation and disassembly of chaperonin chimeras. the whole cell lysates  were analyzed by 12 % sds-page, and soluble fractions  were resolved with 12 % sds-page and 6 % native page with or without incubation for 30 min at 25 °c with 5 mm atp/mg. purified cpn60α monomer, cpn60β <dig> oligomer, and cpn60β <dig> oligomer were loaded as controls. the oligomer and monomer positions are indicated by an arrow and *, respectively. proteins were visualized by coomassie staining



c-terminal  of cpn60β influences oligomer disassembly driven by atp
cpn60β <dig> disassembles into monomers completely upon atp hydrolysis  <cit> . atp analogue  promoted the disassembly of cpn60β <dig>  but adp and non-hydrolyzable atp analogue  did not cause disassembly . in the presence of adp, but not amp-pnp, the binding of co-chaperonin  promoted cpn60β <dig> disassembly . atp binding and hydrolysis drive the allosteric movement of chaperonin oligomers, which rebuilds interactions between subunits  <cit> . therefore, disassembly of cpn60β <dig> might be due to the failure to rebuild these interactions. to further assess how the elements in the equatorial domain respond to disassembly driven by atp hydrolysis, we constructed chimeras with domain replacements between cpn60β <dig> and cpn60β <dig> . when the i <dig> domain of cpn60β <dig> was replaced by the same region of cpn60β <dig> , cpn60β <dig> oligomers were stabilized to detectable levels upon atp hydrolysis . in fig. 5b, the bands under cpn <dig> oligomers were endogenous proteins of e. coli which also appeared in the negative control. oligomer stability was enhanced when both i <dig> and a domains from cpn60β <dig> were inserted into the chimera , but oligomers were no longer stabilized when the both e <dig> and i <dig> domains from cpn60β <dig> were inserted instead . these results indicate that the interaction between i <dig> and a domains stabilizes oligomers. we further analyzed these two domains in the crystal structure of cpn60β <dig> and groel, and found that g <dig>  may affect inter-subunit interaction between k <dig>  and e <dig>  . a series of cpn60β <dig> mutants  evidenced that serine  <dig> hindered the allosteric movement of the i <dig> domain of cpn60β <dig>  preventing interaction with adjacent subunits .fig.  <dig> segments influencing cpn60β homo-oligomer disassembly. a diagram of chaperonin chimeras between cpn60β <dig> and cpn60β <dig>  the domain designation and amino acid numbering are the same as described for fig. 3a. b oligomer formation and disassembly of chaperonin chimeras upon incubation with atp. visualization of the disassembly of cpn60β chimeric oligomers was performed as described in fig. 3c. c diagram of cpn60β subunits and the constructed chaperonin chimeras. the swapping positions are indicated in the figure. d disassembly of chaperonin chimeras. the untreated soluble fractions and soluble fractions treated with 5 mm atp/mg were resolved by 6 % native page and visualized by coomassie staining. recombinantly induced cpn60β <dig> and cpn60β <dig> oligomers were loaded as controls. the positions of oligomers and monomers are indicated by an arrow and *, respectively. e functional replacement of groel by coexpression of cpn60β with chimeras. cpn60β chimeras and groes were expressed in groel/es-deficient e. coli strain mgm <dig>  the strains were grown on medium supplemented with glucose and iptg at 37 °c for 24 hours



more importantly, insertion of the e <dig> domain from cpn60β <dig> into chimeras substantially stabilized oligomers in the presence of atp . we further divided the e <dig> domain into four segments according to sequence homologues and constructed segment swapping chimeras s1–s <dig> . insertion of c-terminal fragments containing at least amino acid residues 484– <dig> of cpn60β <dig> into chimeras significantly stabilized oligomers upon atp hydrolysis , whereas insertion of the most divergent fragment  or a relatively conserved fragment  into the chimera had no effect on oligomer stability. the c-terminus  might stabilize cpn60β <dig> oligomeric states by providing large hydrophobic fragments. replacement of amino acids in the cpn60β <dig> e <dig> domain with the corresponding amino acids of cpn60β <dig> yielded three further mutants . cpn60β <dig>  and cpn60β <dig>  did not influence oligomer formation and disassembly upon atp hydrolysis; however, cpn60β <dig>  changed the electrophoresis migration rate during native page . cpn60β <dig>  did not assemble into oligomers, although a substantial portion of the protein is soluble, a phenomena similar to that observed with cpn60β <dig>  . structural analysis revealed that n <dig> and e <dig> of cpn60β <dig> form van der waals forces between rings to stabilize the oligomers . point mutants of some amino acids involved in inter-subunit interaction showed cpn60β <dig>  and cpn60β <dig>  stabilized oligomers to some extent upon atp hydrolysis , and double mutants showed no cumulative effects . when these amino acids in cpn60β <dig> were replaced with the corresponding amino acids of cpn60β <dig>  no obvious effect was observed . the inherent differences between the equatorial domains of cpn60β <dig> and cpn60β <dig> confer their differential response to atp.

individual cpn <dig> subunits could not complement groel function in e. coli  <cit> . similarly, the chaperonin chimeras , with the equatorial domain from cpn60β subunits and the apical domain from the cpn60α subunit could not complement groel function . coexpression of both cpn60β subunits could partially complement groel function after a long incubation time   <cit> . e. coli mgm <dig> coexpressing cpn60β <dig> with chimera p, which contains the entire equatorial domain of cpn60β <dig>  grew better than with chimera s, which has the e <dig> domain of cpn60β <dig> . conversely, coexpression of cpn60β <dig> with chimera s complements groel function better than with chimera p , suggesting the equatorial domains from cpn60β subunits compensate for each other.

cpn60α and cpn60β subunits are highly cooperative
cpn <dig> subunits could not complement groel function in e. coli alone, but the combination of cpn60α and cpn60β was functional  <cit> . to investigate the cooperation of both subunit types, we determined whether the constructed chimeras  could cooperate with cpn60β <dig> to complement groel function upon coexpression in groel-deficient e. coli strain mgm <dig>  <cit> . as shown in fig. 6b, the intact equatorial domain and at least one part of the intermediate domain from cpn60α is indispensable for functional cooperation with cpn60β <dig> . the presence of one segment of the equatorial domain or the entire intermediate domain from cpn60β <dig> abolished the functional cooperation required for growth . these results indicated that the equatorial domain of cpn60α could not support subunit assembly, but cooperated with cpn60β <dig> to form functional oligomers that complement groel function. we further mutated chimera e  to disturb the salt bridge formed with e <dig>  in the cpn60β <dig> subunit. the co-expression of chimera e  and cpn60β <dig> could partially complement groel function , suggesting that strong interaction between the two segments of the intermediate domain in cpn60β <dig> hinder the allosteric movement of chaperonin.fig.  <dig> the cooperation of cpn60α and cpn60β. a diagram of cpn <dig> subunits and the constructed chaperonin chimeras of cpn60s. the chimeras are same as fig. 4a. b and c functional complementation of groel by coexpression of cpn60β <dig> with chimeras. the experiments were performed the same as described in fig. 1d, using groes as co-chaperonin



in groel, communication between its two rings is mediated by a close salt bridge formed by r <dig> and e <dig>  <cit>  . sequence alignment revealed that n <dig> is conserved in more than  <dig> cpn60β subunits, whereas a negatively-charged amino acid  is conserved at the same position in cpn60α subunits. on the other hand, a positively-charged amino acid  is conserved at position  <dig> in cpn60β subunits, while neutral amino acids are prevalent at this position in cpn60α subunits, except for cpn60α from chlamydomonas which has r at position  <dig> . to test whether e <dig> connected two rings as that of groel, the mutant cpn60α  was coexpression with cpn60β <dig> and groes to complement groel function . once this residue was replaced by lysine, cpn <dig> could not rescue e. coli growth from the groel deletion. thus, e <dig> of cpn60α is essential for the functionality of cpn <dig> oligomers.fig.  <dig> the inter-ring salt bridge between r <dig> and e <dig>  a a view of inter-ring salt bridge between r <dig> and e <dig> in groel. b structural alignment of cpn60α and cpn60β subunits from four organisms. the four organisms are chlamydomonas reinhardtii , oryza sativa , physcomitrella patens , and arabidopsis thaliana . cpn <dig> sequences are aligned with multalin and espript. position  <dig> was indicated by arrows. c functional complementation of groel by coexpression of cpn60β <dig> with cpn60α/mutant. the experiments were performed as described in fig. 1d. the coexpression of cpn60β <dig>  cpn60α/mutant, and groes was induced with 1 mm iptg in groel-deficient e. coli strain mgm <dig>  the strains were grown on medium supplemented with glucose and iptg at 37 °c for 15 hours



discussion
the multi-subunit chloroplast chaperonin cpn <dig> is more complex in composition relative to its prokaryotic homologue groel. cpn <dig>  consisting of both cpn60α and cpn60β types, is functional both in vivo and in vitro  <cit> , whereas the homo-oligomeric cpn60β type is only functional with selective co-chaperonins in vitro  <cit> . recombinantly purified chlamydomonas cpn60β <dig> homo-oligomers exhibit biochemical properties similar to functional hetero-oligomers, e.g. possessing high atpase activity and high protease sensitivity, being binding model substrates and interacting with co-chaperonins  <cit> . however, cpn60β <dig> homo-oligomers were not fully functional in refolding model substrates  <cit>  , which might result from a failure of allosteric movement during the functional cycle . nonetheless, due to the described functional similarity, the structure of cpn60β <dig> probably resembles the structure of chaperonin hetero-oligomers in vivo and is not a result of a crystallization artefact of a non-functional and, therefore, irrelevant protein. indeed, the loosely-compacted crystal structure of cpn60β <dig> was consistent with the observation that cpn <dig> oligomers are highly susceptible to proteolytic degradation. it is not clear why the chloroplast chaperonin might adopt a loosely compacted structure. considering the plastid-specific co-chaperonin cpn <dig> that consists of a double groes-like domain, it is plausible that a loosely-compacted structure has been optimized to interact with cpn <dig>  admittedly, the presented cpn60β <dig> structure may also deviate significantly from the active cpn <dig> structure in vivo; however, it represents a first step toward structural and functional understanding of chloroplast chaperonin and will likely provide insights that can be exploited by future structural studies.

an enlarged nano-cage for substrate folding in cpn60
the folding nano-cage present in the crystal structure of groel/groes is about  <dig>  Å <dig> and could theoretically accommodate substrate proteins of up to 70 kda  <cit> . in reality, the functional volume of this nano-cage is smaller, probably because the  <dig> c-terminal amino acids not resolved in the groel/groes structure protrude into the cage and occupy space. most groel substrates are actually smaller than 50 kda  <cit> . in the crystal structure of cpn <dig>  the diameter of the central cavity is about 6 Å longer than the diameter of the groel cage, but the largest cpn <dig> substrate identified to date is the rubisco large subunit, of only around 50 kda in size  <cit> . tang et al.  <cit>  reported that a groel cage volume increased by 2–5 % remarkably decelerated the folding of large substrates, e.g. mbp  and rrrubisco , by more than 2-fold. consistent with their results, we found that the increased size of the cpn <dig> cavity corresponded to a slower rate of folding of rrrubisco relative to groel  <cit> . chaperonin folding of endogenous crrubisco was not investigated in this study due to the inherent difficulty associated with the biogenesis of green type rubisco in e. coli.

the decisive role of cpn60α is supported by its unique equatorial domain
it is reported that the cpn60α deletion is lethal to plants . here, we found that cpn60α is highly cooperative with cpn60β <dig> to form functional oligomers potentially by regulating the allosteric movement of cpn <dig> oligomers . replacement of the cpn60α apical domain by the same domain of cpn60β <dig> did not influence subunit cooperation and oligomer functionality, suggesting that the apical domain of cpn60α does not play an essential role . the equatorial domain of cpn60β type, but not cpn60α, directs the subunits to form oligomers, suggesting that the cpn60β subunits initiate oligomer assembly  <cit>  . homo-oligomeric cpn60β type possesses high atpase activity, substrate binding ability and interaction with co-chaperonins, and it is partially functional with selective co-chaperonin. the equatorial domain and at least one intermediate segment from cpn60α are indispensable to the functionality of oligomers , suggesting that fragments from cpn60α offer cpn60β subunit flexibility during its allosteric movement. unlike its groel homologue, cpn <dig> exhibits sophisticated regulation between its subunits.

CONCLUSIONS
in our study, the first crystal structure of chlamydomonas chloroplast chaperonin homo-oligomer  was solved at  <dig>  Å, and displayed a rigid body and structural features such as looser compaction, a larger central cavity, less contact sites, and an enlarged atp binding pocket compared to groel. interestingly, we found that the overall structure of cpn <dig> resembles the groel allosteric intermediate state. there are two amino acids  conserved among cpn60s which were involved in regulation of atpase activity by co-chaperonins. our domain swapping analysis revealed that the equatorial domain of cpn60α maintains its monomeric state in the absence of cpn60β . this equatorial domain of cpn60α was also indispensable for functional cooperation with cpn60β <dig>  we additionally discovered that the c-terminal fragment  of cpn60β type influenced oligomer disassembly and allosteric rearrangement driven by atp hydrolysis. more interestingly, two cpn60β subunits compensated for each other to rescue e. coli growth partially. our results shed light on chloroplast chaperonin structure and cooperation between cpn <dig> subunits.
