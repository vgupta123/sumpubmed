BACKGROUND
pinus species play keystone ecological roles, representing the major component of many forests across all continents  <cit> . these species are also the predominantly planted trees in the global commercial forestry sector  <cit> . one of the largest threats to global pine forestry is the pitch canker fungus fusarium circinatum, especially where susceptible pinus species are cultivated  <cit> . consequent losses caused by this fungus have large economic impacts on commercial forestry  <cit> . resistance to f. circinatum varies among pinus species  <cit> . species such as pinus patula and p. radiata, both of which are important plantation species in southern africa, are highly susceptible, while species such as p. tecunumanii are more resistant  <cit> . very little is known regarding the interaction between f. circinatum and its pinus hosts at the molecular level. investigation of the different responses employed by susceptible and resistant hosts, such as p. patula and p. tecunumanii  <cit> , will improve our knowledge of responses necessary for effective defence against f. circinatum.

rna sequencing  approaches have opened the way for transcriptome-wide analysis of gene expression  <cit> . accurate quantification of gene expression using rna-seq, however, requires a high quality reference sequence for read mapping. for organisms with well characterised reference genomes, such as arabidopsis, this requirement is easily met, while organisms lacking a well characterized reference sequence present numerous challenges. although the p. taeda v <dig>  draft genome assembly is available  <cit> , the size and fragmented state of the assembly can limit comprehensive transcriptome analysis  <cit> . de novo transcriptome assembly can be used to provide a reference sequence for rna-seq analysis while circumventing potential issues arising from problems in a genome assembly  <cit> . de novo transcriptome assemblies are available through genbank and the treegenes database  <cit>  for at least ten pinus species , at various levels of completion. of these, the p. taeda transcriptome is the most comprehensive, consisting of data obtained from many different tissues and developmental stages .

the aim of this study was to generate a resource for transcriptome profiling in p. patula by assembling the shoot transcriptome of this economically important species. we report a p. patula shoot transcriptome containing  <dig>  <dig> transcripts, of which  <dig>  <dig>  are annotated. this is the largest gene catalogue for p. patula to date and a major genomic resource, which will facilitate functional genomics research in this tropical pine species.

methods
plant material
six month old p. patula seedlings, from a single open pollinated family, were sourced from top crop nursery, south africa. seedlings were transferred to, and maintained for the duration of the trial in an environmentally controlled glasshouse at 25–28 °c without supplemental lighting and allowed to acclimatize for two weeks. f. circinatum isolate fcc <dig> was cultured on ½ strength potato dextrose agar  after which spores were harvested by washing with 15 %  sterile glycerol. spore concentration was quantified using a haemocytometer and diluted to 5× <dig> spores/ml by addition of 15 %  sterile glycerol. seedlings were inoculated by clipping the apical bud and pipetting 10 μl of diluted spore solution onto the wound  <cit> . seedlings inoculated with 10 μl sterile 15 % glycerol served as mock-inoculated control. shoot tissue was harvested one day post inoculation  for three biological replicates per group . each biological replicate consisted of the top 4 cm of shoot tissue, measured from the wounded apical bud, harvested from  <dig> seedlings and pooled prior to being frozen using liquid nitrogen. frozen tissue was stored at −80 °c until use. disease development was monitored for six weeks post inoculation by measuring lesion and stem length from the wounded apical bud on  <dig> plants per group. f. circinatum infection was confirmed based on culture morphology on ½ pda by re-isolation using tissue harvested from inoculated plants  <dig> dpi.

rna isolation and sequencing
frozen samples were homogenised using a high speed grinder  and total rna extracted using a modified version of lewinsohn’s protocol  <cit> . modifications were as follows: all solutions were prepared using diethylpyrolecarbonate  treated water. approximately 5 g homogenised shoot tissue was placed in a 50 ml conical tube containing 150 mg pvp- <dig> and 300 mg pvpp before adding 15 ml chilled extraction buffer. tubes were mixed by vortexing, snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and allowed to thaw on ice. polysaccharides were precipitated by addition of 1/9th volume  <dig>  m sodium acetate and 10 %  absolute ethanol. nucleic acids were precipitated at −20 °c for 4 h. the pellet produced from ultracentrifugation was re-suspended in 100 μl depc treated water and stored at −80 °c until use. total rna samples were treated with rnase-free dnasei enzyme  to digest genomic dna and purified using the rneasy® minelute kit  according to the manufacturer’s instructions. concentration and integrity of purified rna samples were evaluated using a bio-rad experion™ automated electrophoresis system .

high quality rna samples  for both groups were sequenced using illumina highseq  <dig> instruments . sequence quality of raw rna-seq data was assessed using fastqc v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . quality trimming and filtering of data was performed using sickle v <dig>   <cit>  and all unpaired reads were discarded. short reads  were removed from the filtered rna-seq reads using solexaqa lengthsort  <cit> . the trimmed and filtered read data for all six samples were combined, resulting in dataset  <dig>  fastuniq v <dig>   <cit>  was used to reduce pcr artefacts from dataset  <dig> by removing duplicate reads, resulting in dataset  <dig> 

transcriptome assembly
multiple k-mer de novo transcriptome assembly
de novo transcriptome assembly was performed using three assemblers; trinity r2013-11- <dig>  <cit> , soapdenovo-trans v <dig>   <cit>  and velvet v <dig> .10/ oases v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . assembly with trinity was performed on both datasets using default parameters  <cit> , except min_contig_length =  <dig>  and repeated on dataset  <dig> with the cufffly parameter included. trinity was applied to both dataset  <dig> and  <dig> as trinity allows for duplicate reads, however, soapdenovo-trans and velvet/oases assemblers were used on dataset  <dig> only, where duplicates were removed. assembly with soapdenovo-trans was performed on dataset  <dig>  for eight different k-mer lengths , with the parameters as follows: max_rd_len =  <dig>  rd_len_cutoff =  <dig>  avg_ins =  <dig>  reverse_seq =  <dig>  asm_flags =  <dig>  pair_num_cutoff =  <dig>  map_len =  <dig>  −f and -f. assembly with velvet/oases was performed on dataset  <dig>  for seven different k-mer lengths , with the parameters as follows: default parameters for velveth; cov_cutoff =  <dig>  ins_length =  <dig> and read_trkg = yes for velvetg; cov_cutoff =  <dig>  min_pair_count =  <dig> and min_trans_lgth =  <dig> for oases.

p. taeda v <dig>  genome guided transcriptome assembly
trinity genome guided transcriptome assembly was performed on datasets  <dig> and  <dig> using the p. taeda v <dig>  draft genome assembly  with a minimum contig length of 350 bp. gsnap 2014-02- <dig>   <cit>  was used to align reads to the reference genome for transcriptome assembly using the following paramters: −-nofails, −-novelsplicing =  <dig>  −-localsplicedist =  <dig>  −-npaths =  <dig>  transrate v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to calculate assembly quality metrics.

decreasing redundancy across assemblies
the de novo and genome guided transcriptome assemblies were combined to form a redundant over-assembly. the tr2aacds pipeline, from the evidentialgene package  <cit> , was used to reduce redundancy in the over-assembly by selecting for the ‘optimal’ set of assembled transcripts based on coding potential. the pipeline consists of five steps:  prediction of coding dna sequence  and amino acid sequences for each transcript,  removal of redundant sequences based on coding potential among identical sequences,  substring de-replication to remove sequence fragments,  clustering of highly similar sequences into loci and  classification of transcripts as ‘primary’ or ‘alternate’ and discarding of low scoring ‘drop’ transcripts. the primary assembled transcripts were used for further assessments.

annotation
local alignments to the national centre for biotechnology information  non-redundant  and plant protein databases were generated for the primary assembled transcripts from the tr2aacds pipeline using ublast   <cit> . parameters used for local alignments were: −evalue 1e- <dig>  −weak_evalue 1e- <dig>  −id  <dig> , −weak_id  <dig> . local alignment sequence descriptions were used to remove non-pine origin sequences, sequences with significant alignments to prevalent fungal, bacterial, viral and insect sequences, from the assembly to produce the p. patula v <dig>  draft transcriptome assembly. blast2go® v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  was used to predict protein domains through interproscan  <dig>  <cit>  as well as to perform gene ontology  and enzyme code  mapping. the p. patula transcriptome go distribution was compared to the p. taeda v <dig>  draft genome annotation using categorizer  <cit> . gene family memberships among species were visualized using custom scripts and venn diagrams .

identification of orthologous protein groups
annotated protein sequences for ten different species were retrieved from version  <dig>  of the plaza protein database  <cit>  and four external proteins sets, from conifer species, were also included . the complete set of predicted p. patula v <dig>  proteins from the assembled transcriptome were included. each of the  <dig> protein sets were clustered to 90 % identity within species and combined. gene families were identified and annotated for the  <dig>  <dig> sequences using the approach described in  <cit> . pfam domains  <cit>  were assigned to the p. patula sequences using interproscan  <dig>   <cit> . identified gene families unique to p. patula with fewer than  <dig> members were discarded as these could result from assembly artefacts.table  <dig> protein sets used for analysis of orthologous genes

assembly validation
the core eukaryotic genes mapping approach  pipeline  <cit>  as well as the benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs  v <dig> b <dig> tool  <cit>  were used to identify putative core eukaryotic genes  and universal single copy orthologs  in the assembly as a measure of the completeness and contiguity. busco analysis was performed using the early access plant dataset. in addition, conditional reciprocal best blast  analysis of the p. patula draft transcriptome assembly, the p. taeda v <dig>  gene models and the p. taeda draft transcriptome assembly was implemented with two different sets of reference sequences using transrate  <cit> . reference sets used were as follows: the p. taeda v <dig>  predicted gene models available through the treegenes database  <cit>  and the  <dig> p. patula protein sequences available through the ncbi and trembl databases.

sequence alignments against the p. taeda v <dig>  draft genome assembly were generated to compare transcript to genome mapping of the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome assembly to that of other pinus transcriptomes. comparative alignments were produced using transcriptome data for seven other pinus spp. available from the treegenes database  <cit> : p. taeda , p. banksiana , p. contorta , p. pinaster , p. palustris , p. lambertiana , and p. radiata . transcript sequences were aligned to the reference genome using gmap 2014–02- <dig>   <cit>  with the following parameters: −-intronlength =  <dig>  −-no-chimeras, −-canonical-mode =  <dig>  −-cross-species. the ‘--cross-species’ parameter was excluded for alignment of the p. taeda transcriptome. sequence alignments were examined at two different cut-offs, the first  to compare mapping between species and the second  to account for possible effects due to genome fragmentation. the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome assembly was further validated by alignment to full-length sanger sequenced p. taeda cdna reference sequences present in ncbi and obtained through the treegenes database  <cit> . the  <dig> cdna sequences were clustered to 90 % identity. crbb analysis to the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome was performed using transrate  <cit> .

differential expression analysis
rna-seq read mapping to the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome and expression quantification was performed through rsem v <dig> . <dig>   <cit>  using bowtie <dig> v <dig> . <dig>  <cit> . differential expression testing was performed with ebseq v <dig> . <dig>  <cit>  using median normalization .

RESULTS
data generation and pre-processing
due to the expected size of the p. patula genome   <cit> , sequencing and assembly of the genome would be a costly and challenging endeavour. therefore, transcriptome assembly was employed to generate a p. patula reference sequence. rna-seq of shoot tissue harvested  <dig> dpi for inoculated and mock-inoculated samples yielded between  <dig> and  <dig> million read pairs per sample and a total of ca.  <dig> million reads . quality filtering removed ca. 13 % of reads and duplicate filtering removed a further 35 % of reads. thus dataset  <dig> consisted of ca.  <dig> gb of sequence data and dataset  <dig> consisted of ca.  <dig> gb that passed through quality filtering and were subsequently used for transcriptome assembly.table  <dig> quality statistics for rna sequencing data

comparison of assembler output
the completeness and quality of an assembled transcriptome is affected by the assembly program used as well as the assembly parameters used . comparative studies have also shown that the effectiveness of assembly programs can vary by input data set, with no assembler consistently outperforming any other  <cit> . due to this variability among assembler outputs, each variant assembly is likely to contain more accurate and complete assemblies at different loci. therefore, in an effort to maximise diversity of assembled transcripts, we produced  <dig> de novo and two genome guided transcriptome assemblies using; trinity, soapdenovo-trans and velvet/oases. as expected from previous studies, large variation in the number, length and redundancy of contigs assembled was observed within and between assemblers .fig.  <dig> summarised assembly statistics for all preliminary assemblies. pipt = pinus patula  – assembly size and length statistics.  –transcript n statistics and gc ratio for all assemblies. in each case the right hand y-axis only applies to the dashed line. the first three trinity assemblies were de novo assemblies using dataset  <dig> with  and without  cufffly, and using dataset  <dig> . the last two trinity assemblies represent reference guided assemblies using dataset  <dig>  and dataset  <dig> . for velvet/oases and soapdenovo-trans, the numbers indicated the k-mer value used. orf = open reading frame



trinity exhibited the most uniformity among assemblies compared to the variation among assemblies from velvet/oases and soapdenovo-trans. an inverse relationship has been shown to exist between the number of contigs assembled and k-mer length used for assembly  <cit> . therefore, the greater uniformity in assembled contig number between trinity assemblies can likely be attributed to the program’s implementation of a fixed k-mer length for all assemblies. for each value of k used in assembly, soapdenovo-trans resulted in the highest number of assembled contigs followed by velvet/oases and lastly, trinity. in a comparative study, trinity consistently assembled more contigs than velvet/oases and trinity assemblies consistently had a higher n <dig> statistic  <cit> . although the present study used newer versions of velvet/oases and trinity, the difference in trends obtained illustrates the difference in performance of assemblers under different conditions, supporting the need for use of multiple assemblers during transcriptome reconstruction.

trinity genome guided assemblies displayed lower gc ratios, as well as fewer predicted open reading frames  compared to other assemblies . this was ascribed to fragmentation of the p. taeda v <dig>  genome. nevertheless, the two genome guided trinity assemblies were included in downstream analysis. in total,  <dig>  <dig>  <dig> assembled transcripts were used as input for the evidentialgene tr2aacds pipeline.

the evidentialgene pipeline selects the ‘best’ transcripts based on coding potential, thus selecting for the best orfs assembled. open reading frames were successfully predicted for ca.  <dig>  million  of the input transcripts. of these, 49 % were classified as redundant and 51 % were classified as differing in cds . a further 55 % of non-redundant sequences were classified as perfect fragments of other longer cds, leaving 23 % of the predicted  <dig>  million cds as informative. of the informative cds, 60 % were assigned to the ‘drop’ category and discarded. overall, this brought about a 14-fold reduction in assembled transcript number, with only 7 % of the original input sequences maintained. the resulting merged assembly contained  <dig>  <dig> transcripts grouped into  <dig>  <dig> predicted loci . this assembly was compared to the average assembly statistics across assemblies for each assembly program respectively . despite the decrease in transcript number, the proportion of transcripts containing a predicted orf in the merged assembly was 10–40 % higher compared to the average orfs per assembly for all three assemblers. this indicates that a higher proportion of transcripts in the merged set have been accurately assembled to near-full or full length. the average length among the  <dig>  <dig> longest predicted proteins in the merged assembly was  <dig>  <dig> amino acids. due to the high resource expenditure required to produce these long proteins they are often well-conserved and a biological maximum has been observed for their average length  <cit> . for plants this maximum observed average is ca.  <dig>  <dig> amino acids   <cit> . this indicates that these proteins are well assembled in the merged assembly, although there is room for improvement.fig.  <dig> assembly statistics for tr2aacds pipeline merged assembly compared to average assembly statistics for each assembler. assembly size and length statistics. the dashed y-axis only applies to the dashed line. unfiltered output assemblies from trinity, velvet/oases and soapdenovo-trans were used



annotation
sequence homology searches against the nr and plant protein databases successfully obtained significant local alignments for  <dig>  <dig> loci. of these,  <dig>  <dig> were classified as non-pine origin transcripts and filtered from the transcriptome assembly. the majority of non-pine origin transcripts  aligned to transcripts from fusarium species , with most aligning to either f. fujikuroi  or f. oxysporum . a further  <dig>  % of non-pine origin transcripts aligned to bipolaris maydis , pyrenophora tritici-repentis  and leptosphaeria maculans , while the remaining  <dig>  %  aligned to  <dig> different species.

removal of non-pine origin transcripts resulted in  <dig>  <dig> putative loci, classified as the p. patula v <dig>  shoot transcriptome. the current estimates for conifer gene numbers lie between ca.  <dig>  <dig> for picea glauca  <cit>  and ca.  <dig>  <dig> for p. taeda and p. pinaster  <cit> . roughly 60 % of assembled p. patula transcript sequences were successfully annotated, representing a wide array of molecular functions, biological processes and cellular compartment go terms. the remaining 40 % of the assembled transcript sequences could not be annotated through similarity searches, however, each sequence contained an orf predicted by the evidentialgene pipeline and could potentially be expressed. thus, these sequences were not removed from the assembly as they could represent uncharacterised or conifer specific genes. the top molecular function terms for p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome were protein binding, transferase activity and nucleic acid binding , similar to what has been observed for p. taeda, p. glauca and picea mariana  <cit> .

identification of putative nb-arc defence related gene families
orthologous protein groups were identified by comparing  <dig>  <dig> clustered p. patula protein sequences from the assembled transcriptome to the  <dig>  <dig> clustered protein sequences from  <dig> other plant species  <cit>  . tribe-mcl analysis  <cit>  resulted in  <dig>  unique gene families, with an average of  <dig> members per family . gene families were identified for  <dig>  <dig>  sequences and ranged in size from  <dig>  <dig> members from  <dig> species to  <dig> members from one species. genes from the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome assembly initially clustered to  <dig>  <dig> gene families . this was reduced to  <dig>  <dig> families  by removing p. patula specific gene families with less than  <dig> members. while there are likely valid families in the removed set, these families were removed as most are likely to have arisen due to the remaining heterozygosity in the assembly. of the total gene families,  <dig>  <dig> were unique to conifers . although this is higher than the  <dig>  <dig> reported by the p. taeda genome project  <cit> , it is a similar increase from the  <dig>  <dig> reported by the p. abies genome project  <cit> . included in the conifer-specific gene families are  <dig> that were unique to p. patula. the largest family identified in p. patula  contained leucine rich repeat , toll/interleukin- <dig> receptor , nucleotide binding domain with an arc motif , golgi transport complex  <dig>  and poxvirus a <dig> protein motifs. this gene family was also one of the largest observed for p. taeda and had low representation among the angiosperms while representation in the moss species differed. in total,  <dig> nb-arc families were identified, of which  <dig> were present in conifers. nb-arc gene families with higher representation of angiosperm genes had little to no representation from the conifers and vice versa . the nb-arc family of genes are associated with disease resistance as the majority of resistance proteins  characterized are members of the nb-arc and nb-lrr families  <cit> . thus this difference could result from divergent r gene evolution between the plant lineages.fig.  <dig> unique orthologous protein groups identified through tribe-mcl analysis. left comparison of protein family counts for all identified orthologous protein groups between five different plant classifications. right comparison of conifer specific protein counts between four conifer species. dicots = arabidopsis thaliana, glycine max, populus trichocarpa, ricinus communis, theobroma cacao, vitis vinifera. mosses = selaginella moellendorffii, physcomitrella patens. monocots = oryza sativa, zea mays. gymnosperms = picea abies, picea sitchensis, pinus patula, pinus taeda. basal = amborella trichopoda

assembly validation
many well established metrics exist for assessment of genome assembly quality, the majority of which are based on size, such as contig and n <dig> size. size based metrics such as n <dig> have been used in the past as a measure of transcriptome completeness  <cit> , yet these metrics have no real biological relevance and are ineffective without prior knowledge of the actual size distribution in the sequenced data set. these metrics are also highly sensitive to assembly parameters and assembled isoforms , which can bias quality assessment. for this reason, three reference based metrics were used to assess the transcriptome assembly; completeness, contiguity and accuracy  <cit> . completeness and contiguity are closely linked. completeness is the percentage of a reference set that has been assembled. contiguity is the percentage of assembled reference sequences covered to x%, where x is an arbitrary minimum threshold  <cit> . in this study, contiguity and completeness of the p. patula transcriptome assembly was measured by comparison against four data sets.

comparison to the cegma core eukaryotic proteins identified  <dig>  of the  <dig> core genes, whereas  <dig>  were identified in the p. taeda v <dig>  genome  <cit> . at the same time, of the identified core genes, 91 % showed full length alignments to the p. taeda v <dig>  genome, while 93 %  of those from the p. patula v <dig>  shoot transcriptome were full length. the higher completeness and contiguity obtained for cegs in the p. patula transcriptome assembly compared to the p. taeda v <dig>  genome can most likely be attributed to genome fragmentation. this illustrates the value of de novo transcriptome assembly for analysing genes missing from an incomplete genome. cegma analysis also identified multiple orthologs for 90 % of the identified cegs. this is likely due to the presence of high allelic variation in the data used for assembly arising from the pooled nature of the samples  used for sequencing.

busco analysis against the early access plant data set identified  <dig>  complete buscos, out of  <dig> groups searched, of which  <dig>  were duplicated. a further  <dig> fragmented buscos were identified. the high amount of duplicated complete buscos further indicate the presence of assembled haplotypes still present in the transcriptome  <cit> .

crbb analysis to the p. patula reference proteins showed a similar pattern as above when comparing completeness  and contiguity  of the p. patula transcriptome to that of the p. taeda transcriptome . this indicates higher completeness of the p. patula transcriptome for p. patula origin proteins as would be expected. the completeness  of the p. taeda gene models was intermediate between the transcriptomes, however, its contiguity  was notably lower. this low contiguity most likely arose due to the presence of partial genes in the high confidence gene models. the completeness and contiguity of the p. patula transcriptome assembly was also investigated through crbb analysis to the p. taeda v <dig>  transcriptome assembly using the gene models extracted from the p. taeda v <dig>  genome assembly and the  <dig> available p. patula protein sequences as the reference sets. compared to the p. taeda transcriptome, the p. patula transcriptome covered a higher proportion of the p. taeda gene models , had a higher proportion of reference sequences with a crbb result and had the lowest reciprocal best hit  ratio . overall crbb statistics for comparison to the p. patula proteins were higher for the p. patula transcriptome compared to both the p. taeda transcriptome and gene models .table  <dig> conditional reciprocal best blast  comparisonsa of assembled pinus patula transcripts to available pinus taeda gene models and transcripts


acrbb alignments for query sequences were generated against the available high confidence p. taeda gene models and the available p. patula protein sequences



the third metric assessed was accuracy, defined as the percentage of correctly assembled bases in an assembly compared to a reference  <cit> . this was estimated through high-identity mapping of the assembled p. patula transcriptome, along with seven other pine transcriptomes, to the p. taeda v <dig>  genome . mapping to the genome precluded calculation of completeness and contiguity, due to genome fragmentation and lack of exact gene number and location. at 95 % sequence identity and query coverage thresholds a total of 64 % of p. patula sequences mapped. the highest total mapping rates were observed for p. banksiana and p. contorta, while the lowest mapping rate was obtained for p. lambertiana, as expected from their phylogenetic relationship and previous studies  <cit> . mapping rates obtained for the p. patula transcriptome were similar to the mapping rates obtained for the p. radiata and p. taeda transcriptome assemblies. these alignment metrics serve as a measure of transcriptome accuracy. lowering the minimum coverage threshold to 50 % increased mapping by between 2 % and 15 %. the p. banksiana , p. contorta  and p. patula  transcriptomes were the least affected, while the transcriptomes for p. radiata , p. sylvestris  and p. taeda  showed the largest increase in mapping rates, suggesting that these transcriptomes have a higher content of genes that were fragmented in the genome assembly. comparison of accuracy metrics between assemblies should be done with care, however, as even though the p. taeda transcriptome showed a lower accuracy  than p. patula, the size of the transcriptome means that it still contains ca.  <dig>  <dig> more accurately assembled sequences. this illustrates the importance of considering assembly size when comparing between datasets, such as the high mapping rates to the p. taeda v <dig>  genome obtained for p. contorta, p. pinaster and p. radiata . still, more than  <dig>  <dig>  of the assembled p. patula sequences were shown to be accurately assembled and this number is expected to increase as fragmentation in the genome decreases.table  <dig> mapping statistics to the p. taeda v <dig>  genome

the assembled p. patula transcripts were further compared to corresponding p. taeda complete cds sequences to ascertain the quality of the assembly against experimentally validated data . of the  <dig> cdna sequences,  <dig>  mapped to the p. patula transcriptome with greater than 89 % identity and 80 % subject coverage . of the mapped sequences,  <dig> had a query coverage of more than 80 % with an average sequence identity of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and an average coverage of  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  % for the subject and query sequences respectively . thus, of the p. taeda cdna sequences present in the assembled p. patula transcriptome,  <dig>  % have been assembled to near full-length.

differential expression analysis
comparison of inoculated and mock-inoculated data sets using ebseq identified  <dig> transcripts as differentially expressed between conditions . the small number of detectable differentially expressed transcripts is likely a reflection of the very early time-point investigated, where small amounts of pathogen would have been in contact with the host tissue.

ten transcripts were up-regulated  > 1) in the inoculated set, relative to mock-inoculated, while  <dig> transcripts were down-regulated  < − <dig> ;  <dig> had log2 < −1). among the up-regulated genes four had putative annotations . two of these genes are involved in folate metabolism  and stomatal closure , while the other two are linked to sugar metabolism .

in the down-regulated set  <dig> transcripts had putative annotations . some of these are related to plant defence such as a putative wrky <dig> encoding transcript, implicated in susceptibility against magnoporthe oryzae but increased tolerance to cold in rice  <cit>  and a putative phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  encoding transcript. pal is an important enzyme for salicylic acid production and is a key enzyme in the phenylpropanoid pathway, shown to be induced in response to wounding and fungal infection in pinus sylvestris  <cit> . a putative map kinase  <dig> is also down-regulated. in arabidopsis, map kinase  <dig> is known to regulate the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid/ ethylene defence signaling  <cit> . although it is tempting to speculate that the down-regulation of such important transcripts in defence may, in part, contribute to susceptibility against f. circinatum, a detailed time-course of infection in p. patula is necessary to determine the full suite of host responses during this susceptible interaction.

CONCLUSIONS
this study presents the first transcriptome sequencing and assembly analysis for pinus patula. the p. patula v <dig>  transcriptome assembly constitutes the largest gene catalogue for this economically important species to date. more than  <dig> gb of data was used to assemble  <dig>  <dig> sequences with a total length of 52 mb and an average coverage of more than 200×. of these sequences,  <dig>  <dig> could be assigned annotations. this transcriptome represents a major genomic resource for future studies on this tropical pinus species, and will be used as the basis for further investigation of the host pathogen interaction between p. patula and f. circinatum. the workflow used for transcriptome assembly can in future be reapplied and altered as new sequencing data becomes available for p. patula to produce a more comprehensive and complete assembly. furthermore, the workflow implemented during this study could be applied to other species where a high quality genome sequence is not available. one species to which the workflow could be applied in future is p. tecunumanii, a species that is closely related to p. patula  <cit>  but which displays resistance to f. circinatum. assembly of the p. tecunumanii transcriptome would thus allow for further investigation of the mechanisms differentiating resistance and susceptibility through comparison of defence responses in these closely related species.
