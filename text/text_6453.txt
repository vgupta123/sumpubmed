BACKGROUND
orb-web and cobweb weaving spiders in the superfamily araneoidea use silk fibers and glues for a variety of functions, including prey wrapping, prey capture, egg casings, and web framing  <cit> . each task-specific silk is made up of a unique combination of proteins produced in one of seven different gland types  <cit> . despite making architecturally distinct prey-capture webs , orb-web and cobweb weaving araneoid spiders possess homologous gland types, most of which produce silks with homologous functions. for example, major ampullate glands synthesize dragline fibers, tubuliform glands express proteins that form outer egg-casing fibers, and pyriform gland protein products are used to attach other fiber types to substrates by all araneoid spiders  <cit> . other gland types are homologous in morphology, but have diverged in some functions, such as minor ampullate glands which produce silk used as scaffolding fibers by most araneoids, but additionally functions to form auxiliary spirals in the orb-web versus contributing to prey-wrapping in cobweb weavers  <cit> .fig.  <dig> relationships among spider species in this study. see table  <dig> for species abbreviations and family status. we focused on comparing minor ampullate silks between species that build cobwebs, a disordered three-dimensional web that typically catches walking prey  and species that build orb-webs, a two dimensional wagon-wheel shaped web that catches flying prey . relationships are based on a compilation of published spider phylogenies . the red elbow indicates that one study  <cit>  found the relationship shown in the figure, while another  <cit>  switched the placement of the families to which these species belong




major ampullate silk has been the primary focus of silk research because it is relatively easy to harvest and has tensile strength rivaling that of steel  <cit> . however, all silk fibers have impressive and unique material properties  <cit> . for instance, minor ampullate silk of the orb-web weavers argiope trifasciata, argiope argentata, and nephila clavipes have higher extensibility and lower strength than major ampullate silks from the same species, yet are equally tough . additionally, minor and major ampullate silks display different physical properties when wet. supercontraction in water occurs with a. trifasciata and nephila inaurata major ampullate silks, which allows them to become more extensible while maintaining their high strength  <cit> . however, when minor ampullate silks from the same species are exposed to water, supercontraction does not occur and the mechanical properties do not change  <cit> . despite having consistent behaviors within species whether wet or dry, mechanical properties of minor ampullate silks varied more among species than did the properties of major ampullate silks  <cit> . the consistency of minor ampullate silks’ mechanical properties when wet or dry, as well as their increased extensibility relative to draglines and greater variability among species, could allow for different applications of minor ampullate silk that would not be feasible for major ampullate silk. the material properties of minor ampullate silks made by cobweb weavers have yet to be measured, but given the different functions of this silk in cobweb weavers compared to in orb-web weavers, we predict divergence in the mechanical performance of these fibers.

the variation in physical properties between major and minor ampullate silks and among minor ampullate silks of different species likely results from sequence differences among their component proteins, termed spidroins . spidroins are extremely large  and are made almost entirely of a highly repetitive region, which is flanked by short, conserved carboxy - and amino -terminal regions . the repetitive region of many spidroins contain numerous subrepeats of short amino acid sequences, called motifs  <cit> . motifs found frequently in spidroin repetitive regions include ggx , n where n ≥  <dig>  an where n ≥  <dig>  and gpg  <cit> . an and n form β-sheets, ggx forms 31-helices, and gpg forms β-spirals . secondary structures of β-sheets likely confer strength, and β-spirals contribute to elasticity  <cit> .

major ampullate silks of all araneoid spiders examined thus far are made up of two proteins, masp <dig> and masp <dig>  which are distinguished by a high gpg content in the latter but not the former  <cit> . similarly, n. clavipes minor ampullate silk is made up of two proteins, misp <dig> and misp <dig>  although they are not as distinctly different from each other as masp <dig> and masp <dig>  <cit> . all described minor ampullate spidroins  have consensus repeats that are primarily made up of an, n and ggx motifs disrupted by serine and threonine-rich “spacer” regions  <cit> . the functions of the spacer regions are not well understood, but artificially made recombinant proteins composed solely of spacer regions tend to form oligomers and only recombinant misp proteins that include at least one spacer, repetitive region, and the c-terminal domain can form fibers  <cit> . both masp <dig> and misp are predicted to be composed of β-sheets connected by helical regions and amorphous chains  <cit> . the higher tensile strength of major ampullate silk may result from longer β-sheets made up of an repeats, in contrast to shorter β-sheets made up of an and n repeats in minor ampullate silk  <cit> .

the large size and repetitiveness of spidroins make spidroin-encoding genes extremely difficult to sequence completely. the only full-length sequence of misp known is for araneus ventricosus  <cit> . furthermore, even partial misp sequences have been characterized from only a few orb-web weavers  <cit> . the full length sequence shows that misp repeat units are not as similar to each other as are the repeats of masp <dig> or masp <dig> repeats; and that a. ventricosus misp possesses exactly two spacers that interrupt the glycine and alanine rich motifs  <cit> . the generality of these features for other misp-encoding sequences needs to be tested.

the only known sequences of misp in a cobweb weaver are partial sequences from latrodectus hesperus  <cit> . the known repetitive regions are similar between l. hesperus and orb-web weavers’ misp, with the main difference being length of spacers  <cit> . however, because cobweb weavers use minor ampullate silks for prey wrapping, while orb-web weavers use them in the auxiliary spiral of their web  <cit> , we predict different selective pressures on cobweb weaving misp that could consequently alter secondary structure and physical properties.

here, we characterize complete or nearly complete misp sequences from five cobweb weaving spider species: l. hesperus, l. tredecimguttatus, l. geometricus, steatoda grossa, and parasteatoda tepidariorum . we also measured mechanical properties of minor ampullate silks in l. hesperus, l. geometricus, and s. grossa. our goals were to determine the extent of variation in misp sequences and minor ampullate silk properties within cobweb weaving spiders, compare this variation to that found in orb-web weaving spiders, and identify any relationship between sequence and material property variation across both groups. we found evidence for at least two misp loci in each cobweb weaving species, and that one copy is more highly expressed than the other in minor ampullate glands in l. hesperus and l. geometricus. phylogenetic analyses suggested extensive gene duplication and concerted evolution of misp-encoding loci contributed to variation in misp sequences. finally, we found significant differences in mechanical properties among minor ampullate silks that were partially explained by variation in misp sequences.

RESULTS
multiple loci encode misp in cobweb weavers
we employed a series of molecular experiments to identify misp-encoding sequences in our five species of cobweb weavers. additional file 1: figure s <dig> provides an overview of these various methods.

l. hesperus
shotgun sequencing of an l. hesperus misp-positive fosmid genomic clone resulted in the assembly of three contiguous sequences . one ~ <dig> kilobase  contig contained a complete open reading frame  predicted to encode misp  and 4689 bp upstream and 2183 bp downstream flanking sequence. amplification and cloning of l. hesperus genomic dna with primers designed from the 3’utr of a misp cdna and an n-terminal encoding cdna from this species resulted in an almost complete orf  and 85 bp of 3’utr, which was  <dig> % identical to the published misp cdna  over a 983 bp alignment and  <dig> % identical to the published misp n-terminal cdna  over a 903 bp alignment. in contrast to the similarity between the amplified gene and the cdnas, the fosmid clone and the amplified gene were distinct. pairwise differences between the fosmid clone and the amplified gene were  <dig> % at the n-terminal encoding end  and  <dig> % at the c-terminal/ 3’ utr end . the repetitive regions were too divergent to align. we designated the fosmid clone as lh misp variant  <dig>  and the amplified gene as lh misp variant  <dig> .table  <dig> spidroins included in phylogenetic analyses of n- and c-terminal sequences

primer sets designed to be specific to lh misp_v <dig> versus lh misp_v <dig> successfully amplified genomic dna of three single individuals. variant-specific pcr products were  <dig> % identical to the targeted variant, but only  <dig> % identical to each other on average at the 616 bp c-terminal/ 3’utr region. sequence chromatograms of lh misp_v <dig> and misp_v <dig> amplifications exhibited double peaks in both directions in at least one individual . the pattern of double peaks in one individual but not others for the lh misp_v <dig> specific pcr product is consistent with allelic variation for lh misp_v <dig> and confirms that lh misp_v <dig> and lh misp_v <dig> represent separate genomic loci.

l. tredecimguttatus and l. geometricus
cloning and end sequencing of nearly complete misp pcr products from genomic dna of single individuals of l. tredecimguttatus  and l. geometricus  resulted in  <dig> unique lg sequences  and  <dig> unique lt sequences . within each of these species, end sequences clustered into two distinct groups . average pairwise differences within a cluster were low for n-terminal and adjacent repetitive encoding sequences:  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for lt;  <dig> %  and  <dig> %  for lg. average pairwise differences between clusters for the same region were much higher:  <dig> %  for lt and  <dig> %  for lg. a similar pattern was found for c-terminal and adjacent repetitive encoding sequences, except divergence among sequences was higher; average pairwise distances within clusters were  <dig> %  and 8%  for lt, and  <dig>   and  <dig>   for lg; versus average pairwise distances between clusters were  <dig> %  for lt and 52%  for lg.fig.  <dig> neighbor joining tree for n-terminal misp encoding sequences demonstrates variation within and among species. variants are shown for l. hesperus  and topo clones from l. tredecimguttatus , l. geometricus , and s. grossa . units are number of substitutions. latrodectus clones are arbitrarily numbered, except that lt m1- <dig> and lg m1- <dig> resulted from amplification with primers designed from l. hesperus, while higher clone numbers resulted from amplification with species-specific primers. s. grossa topo clones resulted from two separate pcr reactions, which are indicated here as “a#” and “b#”. completely sequenced clones are indicated by bolded names. see table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> for accession numbers. boxes indicate distinct clusters identified in neighbor joining trees based on n-terminal sequences including adjacent repetitive sequences and in c-terminal and adjacent repetitive region encoding sequences 




because these species are diploid, we expect no more than two alleles per locus within a single individual. thus each species may possess as many as six loci encoding misp . however, because some pcr or cloning error could produce slight variants among sequences  we conservatively considered the two distinct clusters to represent separate loci and completely sequenced one representative from each cluster . we designated the completely sequenced clones from l. tredecimguttatus as lt misp_v <dig> and lt misp_v <dig>  and the completely sequenced clones from l. geometricus as lg misp_v <dig> and lg misp_v <dig>  designation of misp variants with  <dig> or  <dig> is not intended to imply orthology among species, but simply reflects different genomic loci within species.

s. grossa
topo cloning and end sequencing of an ~5000 bp s. grossa pcr product that was generated with primers targeting complete misp resulted in ten identical clones from a single individual. when translated, these ~800 bp end sequences aligned well with our latrodectus misp sequences, but contained numerous stop codons. this variant is likely a non-functional pseudogene, designated sg misp_pseudo.

pcr amplification using primers designed from our ~3 kb c-terminal encoding s. grossa misp cdna  failed to find any further variants. in contrast, topo cloning and sequencing of 20 n-terminal and adjacent repetitive misp encoding pcr products for a single s. grossa individual resulted in  <dig> unique sequences, each different from our ~500 bp n-terminal encoding cdna. the clones  grouped into three clusters ; within a cluster pairwise differences among sequences were < <dig> % on average  while between clusters pairwise differences were much greater . nucleotide differences within a cluster could reflect alleles or multiple loci, but could also be attributable to pcr error because amplification was performed with taq polymerase alone, which does not have proofreading capability, in contrast to the high fidelity polymerases used to amplify the latrodectus species . conservatively, the three clusters represent three true variants. thus there is a minimum of two loci that encode misp in s. grossa.

p. tepidariorum
we found partial length n and c-terminal misp-encoding cdnas from p. tepidariorum  that were nearly identical  to the 5’ and 3’ ends, respectively, of an augustus-predicted gene model on scaffold  <dig> in the publicly available genome. this gene model was predicted to span 10292 bp, but included four gaps . characterization of a topo clone containing an ~ <dig>  kb pcr product for p. tepidariorum misp  resulted in a sequence that was 100% identical to the 104 bp of overlap with the c-terminal encoding region of scaffold  <dig> and filled 2236 bp of the last gap. we refer to the combination of our topo clone with scaffold  <dig> as pt misp variant  <dig> . the fully sequenced topo clone included a 1175 bp long intron with canonical donor and acceptor sites identified by aligning with our c-terminal encoding cdna using spidey  <cit> . we also found blastn alignments of this  <dig>  kb topo clone to three other scaffolds  that may represent additional misp-encoding loci. the c-terminal encoding region of our topo clone aligned with 91% identity on scaffold  <dig>  the intron sequence aligned with 95% identity to scaffold  <dig> and 99% identity to scaffold  <dig>  the repeat region flanking the intron  aligned with 89% identity to scaffold  <dig> and 90% identity to scaffold  <dig>  the presence of two c-terminal encoding sequences that differ by 9% and are placed on separate scaffolds suggests that at least two loci encode misp in p. tepidariorum.

misp loci are expressed at different rates in cobweb weaving spiders
in l. geometricus and l. hesperus, both completely sequenced loci  are highly transcribed in minor ampullate glands  and transcribed at low levels in other tissue types . misp_v <dig> transcripts are more abundant than misp_v <dig> in both l. geometricus and in l. hesperus minor ampullate glands . the ratio was consistent for all tissue types in l. hesperus, however, ratios were much more variable in l. geometricus between libraries of minor ampullate glands and even more so among tissues .table  <dig>

variable genomic structure of misp
all misp genes characterized from latrodectus lacked introns interrupting coding sequence. while only l. hesperus misp_v <dig> included both the start and stop codons, the other misp sequences missed no more than 300 bp of the n or c-terminal coding regions on either end. our p. tepidariorum misp genomic topo clone that includes the c-terminal encoding region has an intron of 1175 bp. for comparison, orb-weaver a. ventricosus misp has a large, single intron of 5628 bp  <cit> .

inspection of the l. hesperus fosmid genomic clone revealed a tata box approximately  <dig> bases upstream of the full-length l. hesperus misp coding region. the nucleotide motif cacg found in all previously characterized spidroin genes was also found in l. hesperus misp,  <dig> bases upstream of the tata box. the p. tepidariorum sequence on scaffold  <dig> in the i5k genome possessed a tata box  <dig> bases upstream of the misp coding region and a cacg motif  <dig> bases upstream of the tata box. the a. ventricosus sequence has a tata box  <dig> bases upstream of the full-length misp coding region, and a cacg motif  <dig> bases upstream of the tata box  <cit> . polyadenylation signals were found  <dig> bases downstream of the stop codon for l. hesperus misp_v <dig>   <dig> bases downstream of the stop for p. tepidariorum misp_v <dig>  and  <dig> bases downstream of the stop for a. ventricosus misp  <cit> .

misp amino acid variation within and among species
cobweb weaver misp length is highly variable within and among species . for comparison, the completely sequenced l. hesperus masp <dig> is  <dig> aa and masp <dig> is  <dig> aa, and a. ventricosus misp is  <dig>  aa  <cit> . glycine, alanine, and serine are the three most abundant amino acids for all misp variants, showing similar composition percentages to l. hesperus masp <dig> and masp <dig>  serine is found in both the spacer regions and the repeat regions, while glycine and alanine are predominantly found in the repeat region only. proline is found in very low abundance for both l. hesperus misp variants, both l. tredecimguttatus misp variants, l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  and p. tepidariorum misp_v <dig>  but is more abundant in l. geometricus misp_v <dig> and is the fourth most abundant amino acid in s. grossa misp, surpassing l. hesperus masp <dig> proline composition . codon usage is variable among misp loci and species, but there is an overall bias toward a or t in the third position of the codon, especially for alanine and glycine .

despite gross similarities in misp amino acid composition among species, arrangement of amino acids into motifs is more variable. l. hesperus misp variants, l. tredecimguttatus misp variants, l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  and p. tepidariorum misp_v <dig> contain mostly n and ggx motifs, with gpg being nonexistent. however, gpg is prevalent in both l. geometricus misp_v <dig> and s. grossa misp . in contrast to masp <dig> and masp <dig>  which have ensemble repeat units ~30– <dig> aa long that are nearly identical, there are multiple shorter, more variable ensemble repeats that describe misp sequences . tandem repeats range in length from  <dig> to  <dig> aa, repeated in the protein anywhere from  <dig> to  <dig> times, and with amino acid sequence identity ranging from 81% to 97% . modularity of ensemble repeats is highly variable among and within species, with l. hesperus misp_v <dig>  l. tredecimguttatus misp_v <dig>  l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  and s. grossa misp having a higher order repeat unit  and l. hesperus misp_v <dig>  l. tredecimguttatus misp_v <dig>  l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  and p. tepidariorum misp_v <dig> having multiple short repetitive units only .fig.  <dig> arrangement of amino acid motifs in misp sequences of cobweb and orb-web weaving spiders. latrodectus and s. grossa accession numbers are in table  <dig>  lh, l. hesperus; lt, l. tredecimguttatus; lg, l. geometricus; sg, s. grossa; pt, p. tepidariorum based on combining the incompletely assembled misp-encoding region from scaffold  <dig> of the i5k genome with an ~ <dig>  kb topo-cloned pcr product, kx584004; av, a. ventricosus, jx <dig>   <cit> . lengths of missing amino acid sequences in pt misp_v <dig> are based on the length of gaps in scaffold  <dig> of the i5k genome, assuming no introns are present within those gaps. the last gap was predicted to be 1782 bp long  in scaffold  <dig>  but our topo clone added 2236 bp, including a 1175 bp intron, which was longer than the predicted gap. the repetitive encoding region at the 3’ end of our topo clone did not overlap with the encoding region present in the i5k genome prior to the last gap




the number and arrangement of spacers is also highly variable among cobweb weaver misp. some misp variants lack spacers while others have up to seven spacers. spacers are varied in their distribution within a monomer, ranging from  <dig> aa to  <dig> aa away from each other in misp proteins with more than one spacer . spacers are easily distinguished from the repetitive motifs in their amino acid composition , near perfect repetition within a misp protein, and similar length across species . furthermore, with the exception of s. grossa misp, spacers are much more hydrophilic than the repetitive region .fig.  <dig> comparison of theridiid  and orb-web weaver  misp spacers. theridiid misp spacers are aligned for l. hesperus , l. tredecimguttatus , l. geometricus , s. grossa , and p. tepidariorum . orb-web weaver misp spacers aligned for a. ventricosus , a. diadematus , argiope argentata , nephila antipodiana , n. clavipes , nephilengys cruentata , and deinopis spinosa  following  <cit> . see table  <dig> and additional file 1: table s <dig> for accession numbers. note that the sequence of spacers in the pt misp n and c-terminal encoding cdnas shown here are identical to spacers found in pt misp_v1




material properties of minor ampullate spidroins correlate with misp sequence variation
we found significant differences in each of four tensile properties of minor ampullate silk fibers measured for three cobweb weaving species . these properties were tensile strength, the amount of force applied to break a single silk fiber, accounting for the diameter of the fiber; extensibility, the proportion of the original fiber length that the fiber was extended at breakage; stiffness or young’s modulus, the initial slope of the force-extension curve ; and toughness, the energy required to break the fiber . post-hoc tukey’s test revealed that minor ampullate silk from l. geometricus had the lowest tensile strength . minor ampullate silk from s. grossa was significantly more extensible and less stiff than the other two species .fig.  <dig> minor ampullate silk fiber tensile properties differ among three cobweb weaving species. boxplots show differences among l. hesperus , l. geometricus , and s. grossa  for a) strength ; b) toughness ; c) extensibility ; and d) young’s modulus . open circles are outliers that exceed the range of the interquartile distance by  <dig>  times. different letters  above boxplots indicate significant pairwise differences according to tukey’s test using a harmonic mean sample size of  <dig> and α =  <dig> 




minor ampullate silks from the cobweb weavers are generally weaker, less stiff, and less tough than orb-web weavers, but more extensible . we found a positive, but non-significant, relationship between the proportion of the gpg motif in misp and the extensibility of minor ampullate silk fibers among the five species with both published misp sequences and material properties . however, when accounting for phylogenetic relationships and evolutionary distances among species using phylogenetic independent contrasts, we found a significant positive relationship between gpg proportion and extensibility , due to the extensive change in gpg and extensibility on the relatively short s. grossa branch . this pattern of higher gpg content contributing to extensibility parallels patterns found for major ampullate silks, although for major ampullate silks higher gpg content results from higher expression of masp <dig>  rather than sequence differences among orthologs .table  <dig> properties of minor ampullate silk for cobweb and orb-web weaving species

phylogenetic relationships of spidroins among orb-web and cobweb weaving species suggest multiple duplication events
spidroin n- and c-terminal domains and encoding nucleotides demonstrate misp sequences found in eight species form a monophyletic group that is usually recovered as sister to a clade of masp <dig> and masp <dig> sequences . theridiid misp consistently group together with strong support . within theridiids, misp sequences from latrodectus species group together, s. grossa misp variants form a sister clade to latrodectus misp variants, and p. tepidariorum misp is sister to latrodectus and steatoda misp variants. within latrodectus, l. geometricus misp variants form a sister clade to l. hesperus and l. tredecimguttatus misp variants; these patterns are congruent with species relationships  <cit>  . however, misp variants group together within a species, suggesting independent duplication events within each species as inferred by reconciling our gene trees with the species trees in fig.  <dig> . alternatively, this pattern could be explained by concerted evolution of terminal-encoding regions within each species, which we detail in the discussion.fig.  <dig> bayesian tree for combined n- and c-terminal spidroin-encoding nucleotide sequences. see table  <dig> for accessions. bold branches are supported by > 50% bootstrap parsimony and > 95% posterior probability in all analyses of combined n- and c-terminal sequences . asterisks  indicate > 95% posterior probability in bayesian analyses of n- and c-terminal sequences. units are substitutions per site. the tree is rooted with bc fibroin <dig>  duplications inferred by reconciliation with the species trees in fig.  <dig> are shown as red dots at nodes. the red dots with yellow outlines indicate that concerted evolution of terminal encoding regions could also explain the observed relationships




outside of theridiidae, relationships among misp sequences are more ambiguous and do not necessarily reflect species relationships. for instance, molecular and morphological characters strongly support monophyly of the araneoidea  to the exclusion of deinopidae and uloboridae . in contrast, n- and c-terminal domains sometimes place deinopid and uloborid misp sister to theridiid misp, and sometimes place araneid misp sequences sister to theridiid misp sequences . the former placement is consistent with an ancient duplication of a misp-encoding locus in the common ancestor of araneoidea, deinopidae, and uloboridae . c-terminal domains and encoding nucleotides for misp from  <dig> species generally show the same patterns within theridiidae, but theridiid misp sequences tend to group with nephilid and deinopoid misp sequences to the exclusion of araneid misp sequences, consistent with multiple ancient duplication events . relationships among other spidroins are consistent with previous findings that gland-specific spidroins tend to group together, with the exception of major ampullate spidroins  <cit> . overall, we inferred 24– <dig> duplication events within the spidroin gene family, depending on which c-terminal gene tree was used for reconciliation .fig.  <dig> bayesian tree for c-terminal spidroin-encoding nucleotide sequences. see table  <dig> for accessions. bold branches are supported by > 50% bootstrap parsimony and > 95% posterior probability in all analyses of c-terminal sequences . asterisks  indicate > 95% posterior probability in bayesian analyses of c-terminal sequences. units are substitutions per site. the tree is rooted with bc fibroin <dig>  duplications inferred by reconciliation with the species trees in fig.  <dig> are shown as red dots at nodes. the red dots with yellow outlines indicate that concerted evolution of terminal encoding regions could also explain the observed relationships




discussion
our characterization of complete or almost complete encoding sequences for the minor ampullate spidroin  in multiple cobweb weaving spider species  demonstrate the presence of at least two misp loci in each species. the substantial variation of misp sequences within and among species and its relationship to variation in material properties has multiple implications for molecular evolution, spider ecology, and biomimetic applications through recombinant dna technology.

two misp-encoding loci have also been documented in the golden orb-weaver spider, nephila clavipes , and therefore the presence of multiple misp-encoding loci in spider genomes most likely dates minimally back to the common ancestor of theridiids and nephilids . our reconciliation of gene trees with species trees suggests even older duplication events . however, the maintenance of two loci appears to involve complex molecular evolutionary processes including intergenic concerted evolution of the loci within species, and multiple gains and losses of individual misp copies. although our reconciliation analyses inferred independent duplication events within each of our cobweb weaving species, the grouping of misp loci within species based on the terminal domains , could also result from intergenic concerted evolution of the n- and c-terminal encoding regions. we favor the latter hypothesis because of the dramatic differences in the repetitive region within some species . concerted evolution of the n and c-terminal encoding regions could occur through non-homologous recombination between the loci, facilitated by their similar sequences, as proposed for the major ampullate spidroin paralogs, masp <dig> and masp <dig>  of multiple species . within theridiids, the rate of concerted evolution appears to be faster than speciation, since relationships among each species’ pair of misp loci reflect species relationships . intergenic concerted evolution of terminal-encoding regions could be favored by selection because these regions are involved in assembly of multiple misp monomers into polymers and the conversion of the protein complex from a liquid to a solid  <cit> . highly similar terminal regions may be necessary for polymers to form.

outside of theridiids, relationships among misp n and c-terminal domains are not congruent with species relationships. the low posterior probabilities and bootstrap support for these incongruous relationships suggest there is limited phylogenetic signal retained in the misp c-termini at the distant time scale of divergence of theridiids from other araneoid families . however, the consistent grouping of nephila and theridiid misp c-terminal domains to the exclusion of araneid misp c-terminal domains suggests that nephilid and theridiid misp sequences are derived from a different ancient copy than the araneid misp sequences, as supported by our reconciliation analyses . the loss of functional misp loci through multiple single nucleotide mutations is further supported by the presence of a misp pseudogene in the s. grossa genome. many additional losses were inferred by our reconciliation analyses , but because of incomplete spidroin sampling for most species we do not feel confident in estimating the extent of spidroin gene loss.

we found extensive variation in the misp repetitive regions between loci within a genome and among species . misp variants in l. hesperus and l. tredecimguttatus, l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  p. tepidariorum misp_v <dig>  nephila misp  <dig> &  <dig>  and araneid misp sequences are similar in terms of amino acid motif composition. s. grossa misp and l. geometricus misp_v <dig> are especially divergent, with the difference between variants within l. geometricus being extremely striking . the divergent repeats have an increased proline content, which likely occurred independently in s. grossa misp and l. geometricus misp_v <dig>  based on gene tree relationships . the mutation of alanine or glutamine codons to a proline codon requires only a single base change and the gpg motif is frequently found as gpga or gpgq, indicating that it could have evolved from n or n motifs, which are the most common motifs in all other misp sequences . intragenic concerted evolution could rapidly proliferate these mutations throughout a single gene as has been proposed for other spidroin paralogs  <cit> . the near identity of spacer sequences within each of our cobweb weaver misp variants  supports the hypothesis that intragenic concerted evolution is common, as also found in orb-web weaver misp  <cit> . however, intragenic concerted evolution must be offset by some other molecular processes, since the remainder of the repetitive regions are not as homogenized as the spacers . the simple amino acid motifs found in misp such as n are encoded by microsatellite-like sequences and could thus be prone to high rates of slipped strand mispairing. it is also possible that excessive homogenization of misp repetitive regions adversely affects its function and is eliminated by selection.

the high proportion of the gpg amino acid motif in s. grossa misp correlates with higher extensibility in s. grossa minor ampullate silk fibers . gpg content is probably not the only predictor of extensibility, however, since latrodectus minor ampullate fibers were more extensible than orb-web weavers’ even though gpg content for l. hesperus is similar to the orb-web weavers. furthermore, we did not find a significant difference in extensibility between l. hesperus and l. geometricus minor ampullate silk fibers despite l. geometricus misp_v <dig> having a relatively high percentage of gpg motifs . the misp_v2: misp_v <dig> transcript ratio in l. geometricus suggests that the gpg-rich misp_v <dig> is in lower abundance in l. geometricus , which could explain why there is not a significant increase in extensibility of its minor ampullate silk fibers in comparison to l. hesperus. cobweb weaving spiders use misp in their prey wrapping silks  <cit> , and evolution of extensibility-conferring motifs could potentially allow for capturing different prey types by s. grossa compared to other cobweb weavers, although little is known about the ecology or diet of this species. it is also possible that l. geometricus modulates expression of its two misp-encoding loci in response to prey availability. experimentally manipulating prey type has been shown to affect proline content of major ampullate fibers in nephila, potentially as a result of plastic changes in relative expression levels of the proline-poor masp <dig> and the proline-rich masp <dig>  <cit> . variation among individuals in masp <dig> and masp <dig> transcript abundance has also been demonstrated for black widows  <cit> . analogous experiments have not been done for minor ampullate fibers. however, the variation in misp_v2: misp_v <dig> ratios that we found between l. geometricus individuals  suggests plasticity of expression is possible.

our six complete or nearly complete single exon misp-containing clones can also serve as templates for recombinant proteins. due to the dramatic differences in length and amino acid content of some of the proteins encoded by these loci, it may be possible to spin artificial fibers with custom-made properties. for instance, the gpg-containing l. geometricus misp_v <dig> could be used to make more extensible fibers, while the longer alanine-rich l. hesperus misp_v <dig> may make stiffer fibers.

CONCLUSIONS
we found that intragenic concerted evolution within misp-encoding genes likely led to rapid proliferation of proline replacements for alanine or glutamine in misp protein sequences independently in at least two species. for one species, the proliferation of proline coincides with higher extensibility of minor ampullate silks. this could allow cobweb weavers to access new prey types or the ability to modulate mechanical properties of their silks through altering expression levels of misp gene copies. our multiple nearly complete misp sequences also provide various templates for tailored biomimetic applications through recombinant dna technologies.
