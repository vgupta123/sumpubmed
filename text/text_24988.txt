BACKGROUND
the conserved family of homeodomain hox transcription factors is critically involved in patterning the body plan of bilaterian embryos by controlling multiple morphogenetic and organogenetic processes during animal development  <cit> . modifications in hox protein expression and activity have likely contributed to the evolutionary diversification of animal forms  <cit> . misregulation or mutation of several hox proteins has been associated with pathologies like cancer or neuropathies  <cit> .

hox proteins are transcription factors which regulate expression of target genes and chromatin remodeling  <cit> . a handful of proteins that interact with hox proteins have been identified so far, and these are almost exclusively transcription factors, like the well-characterized three amino acid loop extension  homeodomain proteins pbx/exd and prep/meis/hth  <cit> , tfiieβ <cit> , tata binding protein   <cit> , gli <dig>  <cit> , maf  <cit> , smad  <cit> , high mobility group protein  <dig>   <cit> , or transcriptional coregulators like creb binding protein /p <dig>  <cit> . hox proteins may also form complexes with the translation initiation factor eif4e to control the translation of target mrnas  <cit> . some hox-like homeodomain proteins can be secreted into the extracellular compartment and translocate through the cell membrane to gain access to the cytosol and nucleus of neighboring cells, so it has been proposed that hox proteins could display a paracrine transcriptional activity  <cit> .

numerous transcription factors, involved in critical developmental processes, like smad, stat, β-catenin or nfκb, are primarily signal transducers. though primarily cytoplasmic, upon activation these can translocate to the nucleus, where they convey signaling by affecting gene regulation. as signal transducers these transcription factors can interact with enzymatically active membrane receptors, adaptor proteins, signal transducing kinases, or ubitiquin ligases. possibly, hox transcription factors could similarly fulfill pivotal roles at the heart of developmental processes, acting at the crossroads between cell-to-cell communication and cell fate determination. to our knowledge no exhaustive interaction screen has been performed to detect functional connections for a hox protein.

here, we conducted a proteome-wide screening for candidate interactors of hoxa <dig>  hoxa <dig> is one of the earliest hox genes to be expressed during embryonic development. it is involved in hindbrain segmentation and patterning  <cit> . hoxa <dig> misregulation has been associated with mammary carcinogenesis  <cit> . we used a stringent high-throughput yeast two-hybrid  approach to systematically test pairwise combinations, using hoxa <dig> both as a bait and as a prey against the human orfeome v <dig>  resource, which contains  <dig>  orfs representing  <dig>  genes  <cit> . of the  <dig> hoxa <dig> interactions identified,  <dig> could be validated by in vivo affinity binding assays in co-transfected animal cells. a striking subset of the validated interactors are not proteins involved in gene regulation. rather, these interactors are adaptor proteins or modulators of the bone morphogenetic proteins /tumor growth factor  β, tumor necrosis factor , receptor-tyrosine kinases  and integrins signal transduction pathways. other interactors participate in cell adhesion or endosomal trafficking. we detected  <dig> interactions in live cells by bimolecular fluorescence complementation . depending on the different proteins identified, interactions either take place in the cytoplasm, in the nucleus, in association with vesicles or show a variable pattern from cell to cell, underscoring a dynamic interplay with hoxa <dig>  numerous identified hoxa <dig> partners reported to interact with each other within known pathways share similar intracellular patterns of hoxa <dig> interaction by bifc. we conclude that hoxa <dig> can contact several subunits of multi-molecular functional platforms involved in cell signaling, cell-adhesion, or cell shape regulation.

RESULTS
a proteome-wide yeast two-hybrid screening for hoxa <dig> interactors
the yeast two-hybrid  is a powerful approach for large-scale screenings to identify binary protein-protein interactions  <cit> . db-hoxa <dig> was tested pairwise against  <dig>  open reading frame -derived proteins from the human orfeome version  <dig>   <cit>  fused to the gal <dig> activation domain . in this configuration, we detected  <dig> distinct interactions . we also screened in the other configuration, hoxa <dig> as a prey  against the full horfeome in fusion with the gal <dig> db. in the second configuration we detected  <dig> interactions, of which  <dig> were also detected in the db-hoxa1/ad-orfs configuration . a total of  <dig> candidate hoxa <dig> interactors were identified. we found the hoxa <dig> homodimerization interaction and  <dig> out of the  <dig> hoxa <dig> interactions, previously described in the literature  <cit>  .

co-purification from animal cells validate forty-five hoxa <dig> interactors
to validate the  <dig> interactions identified by the y2h screen by an orthogonal assay we turned to affinity co-purification of a flag-hoxa <dig> fusion protein co-expressed with glutathione s-transferase -tagged candidate interactors in transfected cos <dig> or hek293t cells. in absence of gst-partners, there was no or very weak background binding of flag-hoxa <dig> onto the glutathione-agarose beads . as positive controls we measured hoxa <dig> dimer formation  <cit>  and the reproducible interaction between hoxa <dig> and pbx1a  <cit>  . in total, affinity co-purification from co-transfected cells confirmed  <dig> out of the  <dig> y2h interactors , in the presence of which a detectable amount of flag-hoxa <dig> remained associated to the gst-fusion/glutathione-agarose beads and could be detected on western blots. it should be noted however that some interactions could not be confirmed because the corresponding gst-orf fusion was expressed at an undetectable level, if at all .

bioinformatics functional analysis
to determine if hoxa <dig> preferentially targets particular biological functions or pathways, we tested for statistical enrichment in regards to the gene ontology go  <cit> ), kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes kegg;  <cit> ) and pathway commons databases .

we observed that six go terms were significantly overrepresented . these enriched annotations are consistent with known functions of hoxa <dig>  linking our set of interactors to developmental and transcription factor function. there were several additional enriched, though not statistically so, go terms linked to development and transcription factors .

the immediate interactors of hoxa <dig> were not enriched for annotated pathways, which could be due to incomplete coverage or relative sensitivity of the y2h assay  <cit> , or be intrinsic to the way hoxa <dig> interacts with pathways, needing only one or few direct contacts. to account for the latter possibility, we also analyzed second-degree interactors, proteins that interact with hoxa <dig> targets. proteins associated with  <dig> pathways are overrepresented compared to random expectation , showing that hoxa <dig> could play a role in various processes other than gene regulation, such as focal adhesion, axon guidance or several signaling cascades.

hoxa1-mediated interactions take place in distinct cell compartments
we tested the  <dig> validated hoxa <dig> interacting proteins by bimolecular fluorescence complementation  assay, which not only tests for protein interactions but can also visualize where the distinct interactions occur in live cells. for bifc, the orf corresponding to each interactor was fused c-terminally to the n-terminal  <dig> amino acids of the venus fluorescent protein , while the hoxa <dig> orf was fused downstream of the c-terminal moiety of venus . detectable fluorescence in cells transfected for the complementary vn <dig> and vc <dig> fusion proteins means that a functional venus has been reconstituted, indicating that the partner proteins interact. as a preliminary control, bifc was assayed for the well-established hoxa1-pbx1a interaction . the vn173-pbx1a and vc155-hoxa <dig> fusion proteins provided fluorescence complementation , whereas the vn173-pbx1a/vc <dig> and vn173/vc155-hoxa <dig> combinations did not . this therefore supported that the n- and c-terminal venus fragments did not reassociate if not fused to interacting proteins. in addition, the immunocytolocalization of venus consistently revealed that the vn173- and vc155-containing fusion proteins displayed a broad intracellular distribution that completely encompassed the narrower bifc signal. in agreement with these controls, like the vn173-pbx1a fusion , none of the vn173-interactor fusions provided fluorescence alone or in the presence of the vc <dig> venus fragment alone . for  <dig> out of the  <dig> interactors tested specific fluorescence was observed upon addition of the vc155-hoxa <dig> fusion protein. distinct patterns of intracellular interactions were observed . for  <dig> proteins, interactions took place in the nucleus . of these,  <dig> proteins appeared to contact hoxa <dig> exclusively in the nucleus, while  <dig> also displayed other patterns of subcellular fluorescence complementation. among the proteins found to bind hoxa <dig> in the nucleus, some were known transcription factors  or were known to have nuclear functions, but other were not . a set of proteins shared a similar interaction pattern characterized by a diffuse, finely-punctuated cytoplasmic signal without nuclear staining . this subcellular localization pattern was observed for different proteins reported to participate in a common signaling pathway. examples are traf, trip or pdcd6ip  which are found associated with the tnfr family of receptors  <cit> , spry <dig> and pdcd6ip modulating rtk downstream signaling  <cit> , pdlim <dig>  and rbpms  which are involved in the bmp/tgfβ signaling regulation  <cit>  and lpxn, pdcd6ip and trip <dig> known to associate with focal adhesion sites and related signal transduction  <cit> . as a control, in cells co-expressing gst-traf <dig> fusion and wildtype hoxa <dig>  proteins displayed an overlapping intracellular distribution consistent with the bifc signal observed with vn173-traf1/vc155-hoxa <dig> . fourteen interactors tested displayed variable interaction patterns, showing mostly nuclear to nuclear and cytoplasmic or nuclear and vesicular bifc signal . this heterogeneous distribution suggests a coordinated shuttling between cell compartments for hoxa <dig> and some partners . the specific associations between hoxa <dig> and  <dig> interactors detected by bifc shows that hoxa <dig> can associate dynamically with distinct categories of proteins in distinct intracellular domains.

discussion
by a high-throughput y2h screen we identified  <dig> hoxa <dig> interacting proteins among which  <dig> were confirmed by co-precipitation from animal cells. the intracellular localization of  <dig> interactions was further detected by a bifc approach. this is the first exhaustive screen and analysis for interactors of a hox protein. our data support the conclusion that hox proteins, and hoxa <dig> in particular, known as crucial transcription factors controlling developmental processes can fulfill unexplored roles in cell signaling, cell adhesion, or vesicular trafficking.

hoxa <dig> appears to interact with several proteins found to be part of molecular platforms associated with a few signaling pathways , membrane dynamics and vesicular trafficking . these platforms contact activated receptors at the plasma membrane and can positively or negatively modulate the downstream signaling or subsequent internalization in the endosomal compartment. by interacting with these proteins hoxa <dig> could either act as a modulator or an effector of these signaling pathways. the bifc assay revealed that most of the interactors involved in signaling pathways display a similar pattern of hoxa <dig> interaction in culture cells. lpxn, pdlim <dig>  pdcd6ip, rbpms, spry <dig>  traf <dig>  traf <dig> and trip <dig>  for example, showed a bifc signal in the cytoplasm, with fine punctuated staining probably related to vesicular compartments . although further experiments are required to identify these compartments, our data suggest that hoxa <dig> interacts with distinct modulators of a given pathway at the level of shared molecular platforms. finally, some interactors such as mdfi, ogt, rbck <dig>  rbpms or spry <dig> display various patterns of hoxa <dig> interaction from cell to cell, possibly indicating dynamic partnerships depending on cell physiological state .

some links might be drawn between the molecular, cellular and developmental processes involving hoxa <dig> and its interactors. lims <dig> for example is expressed in neural crest cells and plays an important role in neural crest development through tgfβ signaling  <cit> ; in mouse, a downregulation of spry <dig> inhibits the rhombomere4-derived neural crest cells to colonize the 2nd branchial arch  <cit> ; rbpms is expressed in the outflow tract of the developing heart  <cit> , a territory colonized by hoxa <dig> positive cells  <cit> . an important group of interactors consists in transcription factors. some of them are known to be involved in embryonic patterning or cell fate decision . in that regard, zbtb <dig>  is a particularly relevant hoxa <dig> interactor. it is expressed during hindbrain development at rhombomere boundaries and, like hoxa <dig>  has been proposed to control hindbrain segmentation  <cit> . transcriptional coregulators, like the set-domain histone methyl-transferase prdm <dig> or the o-linked-n-acetyl-glucosamine  transferase ogt, have also been identified as hoxa <dig> interactors which may contribute to hoxa1-mediated gene regulation. most significantly, ogt has recently been shown to be the homologue of the drosophila super sex combs  protein. sxc is associated to polycomb complexes and is required for their ability to repress gene expression, including hox genes  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
we presented here the first large-scale hox interactome characterized so far. although only a handful of interactors are known for other hox proteins, some interactors identified here for hoxa <dig> are shared with other hox proteins  <cit> . plscr <dig> has been shown to contact hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig>  and hoxa <dig> is also contacted by trip <dig>  rbpms is able to interact with hoxa <dig> and hoxb <dig>  these interactions, as well as other described here, underline that hox proteins should be viewed not only as gene regulators, but also as components of signal transduction and modulation of cell-to-cell communication, cell adhesion and vesicular trafficking.
