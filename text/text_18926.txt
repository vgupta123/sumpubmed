BACKGROUND
innate immune system plays a primary role in the rapid elimination of invading microorganisms, which occurs via the recognition of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns by the cellular pattern recognition receptors  <cit> . intracellular nucleotide binding domain leucine-rich repeat-containing receptor  can recognize microbial components that are transported to the cytoplasm through the bacterial secretion system, which can then activate inflammasome signalling  <cit> . during this process, pro-caspase- <dig> is synthesized by activated macrophages and enriched in the inflammasome, ultimately being cleaved into the activated caspase- <dig>  <cit> . activation of caspase- <dig> subsequently triggers il-1β/il- <dig> maturation and macrophage pyroptotic death. this pathway is important to defend against the colonization of intracellular bacteria in the intestinal tract and systemic circulation .

after infection, salmonella can selectively secret cytoplasmic effectors through its type iii secretion system  . these effectors regulate the host cells’ defense mechanisms to ensure the survival of the invading bacteria  <cit> . infection of salmonella can result in both decreased breeding potential and increased fatality in host organism. therefore, a key defensive step to protect against salmonella infection is to reduce bacterial intracellular survival. currently, there is no effective approach to induce adaptive immunity during the early stages of a salmonella infection, thus it is critical to focus on innate immunity.

during the early stage of infection, salmonella t3ss <dig> effectors are expressed to mediate bacterial infection. once salmonella enters host cells, t3ss <dig> effectors are expressed in order to mediate bacterial intracellular survival  <cit> . though many proteins of salmonella can activate intracellular inflammasome response, over the course of evolution, salmonella has developed the ability to escape the inflammasome responses. this can occur through the t3ss <dig> protein prgj that can activate the nlrc <dig> inflammasome in macrophages, but is only expressed during the early stage of infection. when salmonella successfully survives intracellularly, it no longer express prgj  <cit> . this suggests that if salmonella strain can persistently express and transport prgj to the cytoplasm of host cells, it can enhance the activation of inflammasome and thereby inhibit the intracellular survival of bacteria  <cit> . it has also been reported that the immunization of the listeria monocytogenesis strain that can enhance caspase- <dig> activation can confer protective immunity against a subsequent wild-type challenge  <cit> . thus, it has been hypothesized that the salmonella strain with the ability to enhance caspase- <dig> activation can strengthen the cell’s defense against salmonella infection  <cit> .

previous reports have suggested that inflammasome activation mechanism can be used in the design of recombinant vaccines to limit the colonization of intracellular bacteria in vivo  <cit> . as previously reported, the n-terminus signal peptide of the salmonella effector ssph <dig> can be recognized by t3ss <dig> and transported into the cytoplasm  <cit> . the c-terminus of e. coli esci protein can activate the nlrc <dig>  inflammasome in macrophages  <cit> . in the present study, a recombinant salmonella fusion expressing the n-terminus of salmonella ssph <dig> and the c-terminus of e. coli esci was constructed. the recombinant strain was tested for its ability to activate inflammasome and colonize in vivo in mouse.

the growth states of recombinant bacteria x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> were similar, suggesting that metabolism of the bacteria was not affected by transforming recombinant plasmid into s. typhimurium strain .

pyroptotic cell death of mouse peritoneal macrophages after in vitro infection
il-1β and il- <dig> content in the supernatant of peritoneal macrophages following 4 h of infection  was significantly higher than those in the unfected control . notably, infection with x <dig> induced significantly more il-1β and il- <dig> secretion from peritoneal macrophages than that induced by x <dig> or x <dig> .fig.  <dig> in vitro infection of mouse peritoneal macrophages. c57bl/ <dig> mouse peritoneal macrophages seeded on 96-well plates were pre-stimulated with 1 μg/ml e. coli lipopolysaccharide to induce the expression of pro-il-1β for 3 h. the freshly cultured x <dig>  x <dig> and x <dig> were then added with the desired multiplicity of infection . the cell plate was centrifuged to enhance the contact of bacteria with the cells and the infected cells were then incubated for 30 min. the supernatants containing uninfected bacteria were replaced with rpmi  <dig> complete medium  containing  <dig> u/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml lps prior to the start of the subsequent incubation. the uninfected cells were used as control. a supernatant il-1β and il- <dig> levels at 4 h post-infection  with moi  <dig>   <dig> and 100; b ldh release at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> hpi with moi  <dig> and  <dig> hpi with moi  <dig>   <dig> and 100; c intracellular caspase- <dig> activation at 1 h hpi with moi 100; d cell morphology at  <dig> hpi with moi  <dig> ; c, infected with x4550; d, infected with x <dig>  arrows show pyroptotic cell death); e the count of cells and intracellular bacteria at  <dig> hpi with moi  <dig>  the data shown are representative of three replicate experiments




ldh release assay indicated that x <dig> induced higher cytotoxicity than x <dig> and x <dig> at  <dig>   <dig>  5 h post infection with moi  <dig> and 24 h post infection with moi  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> .

x <dig> induced higher level of caspase- <dig> activation than x <dig> and x <dig> after infection. the result at 1 h post infection with moi  <dig> was shown in fig. 2c.

after 24 h, the morphology of x4550-infected cells  was found to be markedly poor, and the integrity of the cell membrane was completely lost. furthermore, the degree of injury induced by x <dig> was higher than that indeced by x <dig> and x <dig> . intracellular bacteria in the cells infected with x <dig> was significantly lower than that infected with x <dig> and x <dig> .

no significant difference was found between the cells infected with x <dig> and x <dig> with regard to the il-1β and il- <dig> secretion, ldh release and intracellular bacterial counts.

colonization of recombinant bacteria and pathology in mice
the spleen and liver of mice infected with x <dig> or x <dig> had significant swelling with the infection time prolongation, when compared with those infected with x <dig>  six days after infection, the spleen size and weight of mice infected with x <dig> or x <dig> were approximately four-fold greater than those infected with of x <dig>  no significant differences were found between the mice infected with x <dig> and the uninfected controls .fig.  <dig> in vivo infection of mice. six-week-old c57bl/ <dig> mice were intravenously injected with either freshly collected x <dig>  x <dig> or x <dig>  1× 106 cfu/mouse. several days later, the weight of spleen , the bacterial colonization  in spleen and liver, and the contents of il- <dig> and tnf in serum  were counted. three weeks post-infection, the spleen and liver  of the mice were stained with hematoxylin-eosin for pathological assay, all scale bars represent 50 μm. five mice were used in each treatment. the data shown are representative of three replicate experiments




one day after intravenous injection, the bacterial counts of x <dig> colonized in mice spleen and liver were significantly lower than those of x <dig> and x <dig> . as infection time extended, the bacteria counts in the spleen and liver of x4550-infected mice decreased significantly, with no bacteria being detected six days after infection. however, x4550- and x4550- infected mice were observed to have a significant increase in bacterial counts over the time . no significant difference was found between x <dig> and x <dig> with regards to the bacterial counts in the spleen and liver.

all infected mice could secrete il- <dig> and tnf-α at 1 day post infection, while the uninfected mice secrete minimal level of il- <dig> and tnf-α. three days after infection, the il- <dig> and tnf-α levels in serum of mice infected by x <dig> decreased, while those in mice infected with x <dig> and x <dig> significantly increased . no significant difference was found between x <dig> and x <dig> .

three weeks after infection, pathological analysis  showed stronger inflammatory responses in the spleen and liver of x4550- and x4550- infected mice than those of x4550-infected mice and uninfected controls. only a few small necrotic foci were found in the liver of x4550-infected mice, when compared with uninfected controls. in contrast, in the x4550- and x4550- infected mice, large number of lymphocytes were observed in the splenic sinus, and many necrotic foci containing lymphocytes and necrotic hepatocytes were found in the liver. no significant pathological differences were found between x <dig> and x4550-infected mice.

discussion
activation of nlr by microbial components can result in the subsequent activation of inflammasome in macrophages  <cit>  and is beneficial for the defense against intracellular bacteria  <cit> . this is particularly important for the protection of intestinal mucosa and defense against systemic infection  <cit> . currently, the inflammasome mechanism has been predominantly stimulated with peptides in vitro  <cit> . however, due to the complex regulation by bacteria in the host cells, the responses of host cells against these peptides may be different from their response against the whole bacterium. thus, it is more practical to study the inflammasome responses through bacterial infection, rather than peptide treatment. it has been reported that the recombinant listeria monocytogenes that can enhance inflammasome response is attenuated and has a protective effect against virulent bacteria challenge  <cit> . based on these previous findings, it has been suggested that an attenuated salmonella vaccine candidate that enhances the inflammasome responses can also elevate cellular immunity against subsequent salmonella infection  <cit> . to test this possibility, we sought to construct a recombinant salmonella strain that can enhance inflammasome activation.


salmonella pathogenicity islands - <dig> and − <dig> express t3ss <dig> and t3ss <dig>  respectively  <cit> . spi- <dig> is mainly expressed in the intestines to promote the invasion of salmonella into epithelial cells, while spi- <dig> is mainly expressed in host cells to augment the survival of salmonella in macrophages  <cit> . reports have shown that nlrc <dig> can sense salmonella proteins prgj and flagellin, which both contain a common c-terminal amino acid sequence  <cit> . however, over the course of its evolution, salmonella has developed many evasion strategies to prevent nlrc <dig> detection in macrophages. for instance, spi- <dig> and spi- <dig> encode the rod proteins prgj and ssai respectively, which form the needle in t3ss basal body  <cit> . nlrc <dig> can sense prgj, but not ssai, due to one amino acid difference  in the c-terminus between them  <cit> . moreover, flagellin is repressed in the intracellular environment while spi- <dig> t3ss is active  <cit> . taken together, it has been hypothesized that recombinant salmonella expressing flagellin or prgj from a spi- <dig> co-regulated promotor can be persistently detected via nlrc <dig> and completely cleared in vivo  <cit> . as reported, salmonella effector ssph <dig> can be translocated by t3ss <dig> and colocalize with the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton  <cit> . the recombinant salmonella expressing fusion protein of ssph <dig> and exogenous antigen can translocate the latter into the cytoplasm of macrophages  <cit> . furthermore, the ssph <dig> n-terminal amino acid sequence is conserved among different salmonella strains and can be used as an efficient delivery vector  <cit> . esci protein, the inner rod protein of enteropathogenic e. coli, is secreted in the early stage of infection  <cit>  and its c-terminal sequence can activate the nlrc <dig> inflammasome  <cit> . in this experiment, the n-terminus of ssph <dig> and the c-terminus of esci were selected to construct the recombinant salmonella expressing fusion protein ssph2-esci.


salmonella lacking asd gene has an obligatory requirement for dap because the asd mutant will undergo lysis in environments deprived of dap. the asd + plasmid containing the wild-type asd gene can complement the mutants to become a stable balanced-lethal system and be used to express exogenous antigens  <cit> . the △crp △cya salmonella strain x <dig> is avirulent and immunogenic in mice, and introduction of asd + plasmid pya <dig> into x <dig> could completely restore avirulent  <cit> . it is reported that x <dig> still can survive in mice for a long time  <cit> . therefore, x <dig> is usually used to express exogenous antigen to promote immunity without any antibiotic selection. in this experiment, x <dig> was selected as the vector to express and transport fusion protein ssph2-esci.

the intracellular caspase- <dig> activation and secretion of il-1β and il- <dig> are essential for inflammasome response in macrophages  <cit> . the recombinant bacteria expressing ssph2-esci could significantly promote the secretion of il-1β and il- <dig> and the pyroptotic cell death of macrophages in in vitro infection when compared with bacteria expressing ssph <dig> only, suggesting that the intracellular recombinant salmonella can successfully express fusion protein ssph2-esci and the ssph <dig> n-terminus can be used as a signal to deliver esci c-terminus into the host cells, resulting in activation of the nlrc <dig> inflammasome. furthermore, in in vivo infection, the expression of ssph2-esci, but not ssph <dig> alone, could inhibit the colonization of recombinant bacteria, suggesting that reduction of bacterial colonization in mice may be due to the activation of nlrc <dig> inflammasome by esci in the cytoplasm.

so far, there are different interpretations about how the inflammasome pathway is used during immune defense  <cit> . pyroptosis can lyse the host cells and the pathogen can then be phagocytosed by neutrophils, resulting in bacterial death. as reported, a sifa gene-mutated salmonella can destroy the salmonella-containing vacuole due to caspase- <dig> activation, but not due to the secretion of il-1β and il- <dig>  it is also reported that the clearance of burkholderia occurs, in part, due to the secretion of il-1β and il- <dig> after nasal infection. this indicates that pyroptosis is a defense mechanism to clear intracellular bacteria  <cit> . the anti-infection defense of recombinant l. monocytogenes that enhanced the inflammasome activation is due to caspase-1-induced pyroptosis, but not due to the secretion of il-1β and il- <dig>  <cit> . in this experiment, the inhibition of salmonella colonization in mice several days after intravenous infection may be due to the pyroptosis observed in the earlier stages of infection. the definite mechanism should be further studied in the future using nlrc4¯ mice.

the inflammasome pathway was first named and characterized in  <dig>  <cit>  and has since seen great effort to elucidate its mechanism of action. this work can also lead to some applications, especially in the attenuated vaccine design. because activated inflammasome is not specific to a particular bacteria, this will provide a general platform for the development of vaccine of not only salmonella, but also other intracellular pathogens.

CONCLUSIONS
through construction of recombinant salmonella, we found that the expression of ssph2-esci could enhance the activation of inflammasome responses in macrophages and decrease the colonization of bacteria in mice. we speculate that the fusion protein ssph2-esci may be transported into the cytoplasm of macrophages and then activate nlrc <dig> inflammasome, which limits the colonization of salmonella.
