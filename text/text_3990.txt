BACKGROUND
the number of infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms that are resistant to at least one antibiotic has grown at an alarming rate over the past several decades. these multi-drug resistant organisms have reduced the clinical utility of many commonly-used antibiotics, and pan-resistant strains now threaten to render some infectious agents nearly untreatable. the infectious diseases society of america has identified six multi-drug resistant pathogens in particular that pose the gravest threat to human health
 <cit> , one of which is the gram-negative bacterium klebsiella pneumoniae. k. pneumoniae is a member of the family enterobacteriaceae, and exhibits close genetic relationship to several genera within this family, especially escherichia. despite this similarity, many klebsiella species, including klebsiella pneumoniae, possess a thick, extracellular polysaccharide capsule that distinguishes this genus from other enterobacteria. this capsule is thought to be a significant virulence factor that helps to protect the bacterium during infection from phagocytosis
 <cit>  and antimicrobial peptides
 <cit> . k. pneumoniae causes a wide range of diseases worldwide such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and surgical wound infections that primarily afflict immunocompromised patients. there are also highly invasive community-acquired pathotypes characterized by bacteremic liver abscesses or endophthalmitis that are particularly endemic in asia
 <cit> , especially in taiwan
 <cit> , and reports of their occurrence are now emerging in other parts of the world
 <cit> .

to combat the threat posed by k. pneumoniae and other drug-resistant pathogens, the genomes from many clinical and laboratory-derived isolates have been sequenced to investigate the genetic basis of infection-relevant phenotypes such as virulence and antibiotic resistance
 <cit> . several notable discoveries have been made through these sequencing efforts, for example the identification of plasmids that bear new delhi metallo-β-lactamase  <dig> , a gene that confers resistance to the last-line carbapenem antibiotics that are used to treat difficult k. pneumoniae infections
 <cit> . other studies have sought to build upon the abundance of sequence data to delineate fundamental operational features of the genome, for instance the identity and binding site locations of major transcription factors, the environmental signals that stimulate transcription of certain genes, the architecture of operons, sub-operons, and transcription units, the existence of small non-coding rnas, and other elements
 <cit> . such studies often rely on the acquisition and analysis of genome-wide data sets such as chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarray hybridization , transcriptome profiling, proteomics, and metabolomics, ultimately resulting in a global map of the transcriptional architecture for the bacterium under defined growth conditions. in turn, this map provides a fundamental link between the genotype and phenotype for the organism.

using chip-chip, tiling array, and deep sequencing technology, we report here a delineation of the transcriptional architecture for a pathogenic, multi-drug resistant strain of klebsiella pneumoniae during exponential and stationary phase growth. key findings include the detection of over  <dig> binding sites for rpod and rpos, nearly  <dig> rna transcript segments that have multiple transcription start sites, and over  <dig> leaderless mrnas.

RESULTS
analysis of transcriptional architecture
to construct the transcriptional architecture of the k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> genome, we determined the active coding regions of the genome in both exponential and stationary phase by investigating gene expression, rnap, rpod, and rpos binding sites, and transcription start site  data collected under these two growth conditions . a particular genomic region was deemed to be transcribed if the gene expression data for that locus was above an estimated baseline value of log <dig> = ~ <dig>  because our microarray lacked negative control probes
 <cit> , we based this value on the detected signal from non-coding regions such as intergenic regions. the data were transformed into binary expressed/unexpressed calls based on this threshold, and subsequently used as the basis to determine contiguous transcript segments. rnap, rpod, and rpos binding sites were identified from similar log ratio data sets from triplicate chromatin immunoprecipitation  samples using nimblescan software . we then calculated the median position of those regions to avoid a skewed position by unwanted noise. we identified rnap binding sites from chip data collected during exponential phase only since the binding sites do not differ appreciably between the exponential and stationary growth phases
 <cit> . in addition, cells were treated with rifampicin to generate a static rnap binding map
 <cit> . for rpod or rpos binding site identification, we prepared a chip library from cells harvested in exponential phase and stationary phase, respectively. chip samples were then hybridized to a custom-designed tiled microarray to pinpoint the genomic locations where these proteins bound. by comparing rnap, chip-chip data against both rpod, and rpos chip-chip data and expression data all acquired simultaneously under the same growth conditions, it is possible to segregate what appear to be contiguous transcripts into distinct transcription segments
 <cit> . tsss were identified using a modified 5′-race protocol combined with deep sequencing, which only detects mrnas with triphosphates at the 5′ end
 <cit> . the data are summarized in table 
 <dig> 

from our chip-chip data, we detected  <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> binding sites for rnap, rpod, and rpos, respectively. the rnap-guided transcript segmentation method integrates the presence or absence of a particular transcript with rnap-binding information, which minimizes the error associated with the assembly of unrelated transcripts
 <cit> . this methodology has been applied to this study. gene expression data supported by rnap binding site data suggest that there are  <dig> rnap-guided transcript segments  in k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig>  among this group,  <dig> rtss were detected in both the exponential and stationary phase while  <dig> and  <dig> rtss were detected only during exponential phase and stationary phase growth, respectively . the  <dig> rtss include the expression of  <dig> annotated genes out of a total of  <dig> genes in the current genome annotation . based on this annotation, the expression of  <dig> and  <dig> genes were detected during exponential and stationary phase, respectively, of which  <dig> genes were expressed during both growth phases. thus, there were  <dig> and  <dig> genes that were expressed during exponential and stationary phase only, respectively. interestingly, a large number  of the  <dig> genes that were expressed only during stationary phase growth play a putative role in carbohydrate transport and metabolism based on their cog classification . the functions of these  <dig> genes are enriched for sugar transport, sugar isomerization, glycoside hydrolysis, and phosphotransferase system , which are all related to carbohydrate uptake
 <cit> .

to establish transcription start sites, we performed a simultaneous analysis of both our raw tss data and the  <dig> rtss and assigned a tss if it appeared within  <dig> bp from the 5′ start point of an rts. this analysis resulted in a total of  <dig> tss signals,  <dig> on the chromosome and  <dig> on the five plasmids. one-hundred ninety-three rtss were observed to have two or more tsss. based on cog classification, the largest group among these  <dig> rtss was a set of  <dig> that are involved in transcription . four of these  <dig> transcription-related rtss have three or more tsss. for example, the rts that includes kpn_ <dig>  a transcriptional regulator involved in biosynthesis and transport of aromatic amino acids, has four tsss. the existence of multiple tsss suggests that this and other similar genes are transcribed under multiple, specific conditions rather than under conditions of general growth. when the tss data was extended to include both the rts and expression profiling data, we observed  <dig> leaderless mrnas, defined here as transcripts with a 5′ utr length of less than or equal to  <dig> bp. this number is nearly double what has been reported for other bacteria such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain sl <dig> 
 <cit> , helicobacter pylori 
 <cit> , and geobacter sulfurreducens 
 <cit> .

non-coding genes
among non-coding rnas, the current annotation for the k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> genome contains  <dig> trnas and  <dig> rrnas and an unknown number of small rnas . the presence of srnas are much more difficult to predict because genome annotation algorithms are based predominantly on protein coding regions. the possible existence and location of srnas are therefore frequently extracted from whole-genome rna expression data sets that probe not just open reading frames, but the intergenic regions where srnas are located as well
 <cit> .

since our tiled-array data provide this whole-genome information, we examined whether we could detect srnas in k. pneumoniae by analyzing unannotated transcripts in our data set using the rfam database
 <cit> . out of  <dig> unannotated transcripts,  <dig> of them matched an srna already reported in rfam . among this list, we could detect high-level transcription of srad , srob  and csrc  during stationary phase growth only, an observation that is consistent with data from other enterobacteria
 <cit> . nine of the srnas, ryhb, sral, srob, srac/ryea, micf, srad, gcvb, srah and isrn, are reported to possess the ability to bind hfq, a bacterial rna binding protein
 <cit> . six srnas, srob, srac/ryea, micf, srad, gcvb, and srah, are reported to regulate protein translation through antisense binding to target mrnas. interestingly, we could detect the transcription of both ryeb and srcc/ryea srna even though their genomic locations overlap on opposite strands . however, we could detect transcription of srcc/ryea only during exponential phase and ryeb only during stationary phase. this observation suggests that the two srnas might act in a coordinated manner to regulate different aspects of growth rather than in a concerted, simultaneous manner. we cannot rule out the possibility, however, that srcc/ryea and ryeb might be expressed at low levels during stationary and exponential phase, respectively, that are below the detection limits of the measurement and data analysis systems employed here.

putative open reading frames
several rtss in our data sets did not correspond to any orfs in the current sequence-based annotation for k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig>  for each of these unannotated transcripts, we investigated whether they might show homology to any known gene products by first searching for start and stop codons in the rts that yielded the longest dna sequence and had the same reading frame. this dna sequence was then translated into a peptide sequence and a blastp search performed against the refseq database with a cutoff e-value of  <dig> . this analysis resulted in  <dig> putative orfs,  <dig> of which reside on one of the five plasmids harbored by this strain . most of these putative orfs are currently annotated as hypothetical proteins, but several show high homology  to annotated genes from other strains or species of klebsiella or to members from other genera. in turn, this close match raises the probability that the underlying putative orf does indeed encode a known gene product. for example, the sequence for ‘rts_nc_009648_322945_323714_+_exp’ is homologous to had hydrolase from klebsiella sp. ms 92– <dig>  but is not annotated as such in k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig>  other examples include a set of seven rtss encoded by the pkpn <dig> plasmid that show homology to resolvase proteins from e. coli ms 107– <dig> . these and other examples  highlight the significant strength that comes from the use of sample-matched multi –omic data sets to experimentally refine genome annotations based primarily on computational predictions.

antisense transcripts
through further analysis of unannotated transcripts, we identified  <dig> probable antisense transcripts in the k. pneumoniae transcriptome using a cutoff of 90% overlap to the corresponding gene . this number decreases to  <dig> probable antisense transcripts when a cutoff of 100% overlap is used. we used the classification scheme of yin et al.
 <cit>  to group the antisense transcripts into three categories: 5′ overlapping, 3′ overlapping, and ‘completely covered’. this categorization indicates which parts of the two sequences overlap
 <cit> . we further divided ‘completely covered’ into two sub-categories: ‘antisense rts completely covered by sense rts’ and ‘sense rts completely covered by antisense rts’. the current annotation of the k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> genome lists  <dig> genes, approximately  <dig> more than e. coli or bacillus subtilis; therefore,  <dig> % of the genes in k. pneumoniae have antisense transcription using an overlap of 90%, which is a similar value to what has been reported for e. coli <cit> . additional studies in e. coli <cit>  as well as data from other bacteria
 <cit>  suggest, however, that the proportion of antisense transcripts is closer to ~10-20% of the number of genes in a bacterium. consequently, the smaller number reported here for k. pneumoniae might reflect an incomplete list of antisense transcripts due to low detection sensitivity.

the expression of antisense transcripts for certain genes often varied with the growth phase. for example, we detected antisense transcription from  <dig> trna genes during stationary phase but only one of these genes, the trna for serine , had antisense transcription during exponential phase. similarly, there was antisense transcription for fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase , an amino acid exporter , the transcriptional regulator gene lysr , and the transcriptional regulator gene argr  during stationary phase but not exponential phase. lysr is negatively autoregulated and coordinately activates transcription of lysa , which encodes the enzyme catalyzing the last step in lysine biosynthesis
 <cit> . argr complexed with l-arginine represses the transcription of several genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of arginine and histidine, and activates genes for arginine catabolism
 <cit> . argr represses the expression of abc transporters for putrescine, lysine, and ornithine as well
 <cit> . since the inhibition of this large set of genes leads to the reduced uptake of these nutrients, the regulation of argr expression by antisense transcription is one possible way to adjust metabolism during stationary phase.

we detected antisense transcripts for the marr and marb genes within the marrab operon during exponential phase growth. we focused attention on this operon since mara is known to play a role in pathogenesis: the protein activates genes that mitigate the effects of exposure to environmental stresses such as antibiotics and oxidants
 <cit> . marr is the transcriptional repressor of the marrab operon, but the function of marb is unknown. we could not detect any antisense transcription for mara, suggesting that the regulation of this transcriptional activator occurs through marr and possibly marb rather than antisense control of mara itself. curiously, we detected antisense transcripts for soxs, which is a dual transcriptional activator that helps to protect the cell against oxidative stress
 <cit> , despite the absence of antibiotics or other factors known to promote this phenomenon. many factors contribute to the ability of k. pneumoniae to resist many antibiotics, but these observations suggest that transcriptional regulators and their antisense transcripts might play a role in this process.

transcription network among sigma factors
according to the current annotation, k. pneumoniae has five major sigma factors – rpod, rpos, rpon, rpoh, and rpoe. because rpod and rpos are the major sigma factors that are active in exponential phase and stationary phase, respectively
 <cit> , we performed chip-chip experiments to determine the binding sites for rpod during exponential phase and rpos during stationary phase. we found that rpod could bind upstream of the genes that encode each of the five sigma factors, including its own , data which are consistent with observations from e. coli <cit> . in contrast, rpos binding sites were detected throughout 5′ upstream regions for each sigma factor gene except its own . rpos has been shown to bind to the promoter of rpoh in e. coli <cit> , but the observation that rpos can bind to and regulate the expression of rpod, rpon, and rpoe as well in a member of the enterobacteriaceae appears to be a novel finding.

when phase-specific expression levels of the five sigma factors were compared, rpod, rpon, and rpoh had higher expression levels in exponential phase than in stationary phase , whereas rpos and rpoe had higher expression levels in stationary phase. the expression level of rpod, rpon, and rpoh in stationary phase decreased to 48%, 47%, and 73%, respectively, when compared to those in exponential phase. in contrast, the expression level of rpos and rpoe in stationary phase increased to 430% and 497%, respectively. the dramatic increase of expression level of rpoe is in accordance with a previous report
 <cit> , and implies that rpoe plays a pivotal role in cell survival during prolonged stationary phase.

rpod and rpos dna binding motifs
the − <dig> and − <dig> sequence motifs for rpod and rpos promoter binding sites in k. pneumoniae extracted from our rpod and rpos chip-chip and tss data sets are identical to those found in e. coli, likely reflecting high conservation of these two sigma factors . there is a strong tataat signal  at the − <dig> position in promoters recognized by rpod , which exactly matches that found in e. coli <cit>  and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium
 <cit> . similarly, a ttgaca consensus signal was found at the − <dig> position that closely matches that found in e. coli. for rpos, our data suggest that its binding motif in k. pneumoniae at the − <dig> position is tatat , whereas the same element in e. coli is tayact 
 <cit> . immediately upstream of this motif in k. pneumoniae is a gc sequence, and immediately downstream is a taa sequence, both of which are also characteristic features of e. coli rpos − <dig> promoter elements.

transcription of putative virulence genes
the k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig> genome contains a number of genes that encode putative virulence factors such as capsular polysaccharides , siderophore biosynthesis and transport, lps biosynthesis and transport, and fimbriae
 <cit> . in k. pneumoniae, the expression levels of these genes during stationary phase growth decreased to less than half their exponential phase values .

the expression of genes associated with siderophore biosynthesis during stationary phase dropped to ~35% of their corresponding exponential phase level . reinforcing the expression data, we detected  <dig> rtss during exponential phase that contained one or more genes related to siderophore biosynthesis, but we could detect only  <dig> such rtss during stationary phase . when the absolute signal intensity of siderophore-associated genes is taken into account  =  <dig> ) and compared to the baseline signal  = ~6), siderophore-associated genes have nearly no expression during stationary phase.

the expression data for genes involved in cps biosynthesis followed a similar trend as the expression data for siderophore biosynthesis, but the rts data differed between the two. during stationary phase, the expression levels of cps-associated genes fell to  <dig> - 40% of their values during exponential phase. on the other hand, more rtss containing cps-associated genes were detected during stationary  than exponential  phase. these data imply that post-transcriptional regulation might play a greater role in modulating the transcript abundance of cps-associated genes than siderophore-associated genes during stationary phase.

in contrast to siderophore- and cps-associated genes, genes associated with both fimbriae and lps have similar expression levels in both exponential and stationary phases. the average log <dig> for the two were ~ <dig>  and ~ <dig>  respectively . interestingly, however, several fimbriae-associated genes such as kpn_ <dig>  and the gene cluster kpn_ <dig> ~ kpn_ <dig>  showed much higher expression levels during both growth phases  ≥ 12) than other loci that are also associated with fimbriae. genbank currently does not associate the kpn_ <dig> ~ kpn_ <dig> cluster with a specific type of fimbriae, but they are ~99% homologous at the nucleotide level to the mrkjfdcb cluster from k. pneumoniae ntuh- <dig> that encodes type  <dig> fimbriae. this observation implies that type  <dig> fimbriae constitute the major class of fimbria expressed by k. pneumoniae mgh  <dig>  in contrast to fimbriae, little variation was detected among the full set of genes associated with lps biosynthesis, implying that lps is continually synthesized regardless of growth phase.

discussion
genome sequences are most commonly annotated using bioinformatics-based algorithms, but these algorithms can misannotate genes or introduce other errors
 <cit> . moreover, a genome sequence by itself provides scant information concerning its functional operation, for example which genes are activated or repressed under specific growth conditions and how their expression is regulated. against this backdrop, experiment-based techniques such as gene expression and other -omics data provide a foundation with which to verify or correct computation-based annotations at a genome-wide level. we report here such data for klebsiella pneumoniae mgh  <dig> through the integrated analysis of gene expression, chip-chip of rnap, rpod and rpos, and tss data during exponential and stationary phase growth. the integrated analysis of these different data sets ensures that findings from one particular data set are reinforced by another, thereby minimizing potential false-positive and -negative findings that might emerge when these data sets are analyzed in isolation
 <cit> .

small rnas are increasingly recognized as important, ubiquitous elements that regulate mrna half-life, protein translation, and other processes, thereby providing an additional layer of regulatory control of multiple target genes
 <cit> . we detected  <dig> srnas in k. pneumoniae through comparison of intergenic transcripts in our data sets to known srnas in the rfam database. nine of these fifteen have been reported to act through hfq, and the expression levels for six of them changed at least two-fold in a Δhfq knockout mutant of k. pneumoniae <cit> . the expression level for a seventh, ryhb, changed by less than two-fold in the mutant, while an additional two hfq-binding srnas, sral and isrn, are newly detected in our data set. all fifteen srnas detected here have also been detected in both e. coli and s. typhimurium
 <cit> , suggesting the existence of a common regulatory network involving these srnas that is shared among multiple enterobacteria. k. pneumoniae likely contains many more srnas than the  <dig> detected here, however, since greater numbers of srnas have been reported for both e. coli and s. typhimurium
 <cit> .

as with srnas, we detected a much smaller number of tsss in k. pneumoniae than has been reported for e. coli  and transcription units  even though the current genbank annotations list approximately  <dig> more genes for k. pneumoniae than for e. coli. these differences likely stem from the greater number of growth conditions that were investigated in the e. coli study, an observation that highlights the plasticity of the transcriptional architecture within these two bacteria as they respond to different environments. s. typhimurium by comparison has been reported to contain much fewer tsss, approximately  <dig> in number
 <cit> , but this disparity likely arises from the different data analysis procedures that were employed in the s. typhimurium study versus those for k. pneumoniae and e. coli.

in contrast to srna and tss data, we detected a greater number of leaderless rnas for k. pneumoniae than have been identified to date in other bacteria. although this observation suggests that these transcripts might have a functional impact or evolutionary significance that is unique to k. pneumoniae, we anticipate that deep sequencing of the transcriptomes from additional microorganisms under multiple growth conditions will eventually yield a similar amount of leaderless rnas.

beyond delineating the transcriptional architecture of k. pneumoniae, the data presented here highlight the significant impact that the growth phase can have on the expression of virulence genes and, by extension, on drug target selection. for instance, one possible antibiotic development strategy is to interfere with non-essential microbial processes such as capsule, siderophore, and fimbriae biosynthesis and quorum sensing that result in weakened virulence but do not kill the pathogen outright. although there is some debate
 <cit> , such strategies are attractive in large part because resistance is expected to emerge at a much slower rate, thereby prolonging the clinical utility of drugs designed with this mechanism of action. since these processes are non-essential, however, the underlying enzymes might not be present under all conditions. without a target to inhibit, antibiotics developed against these enzymes would therefore be expected to have little effect. our data indicate that attempts to inhibit k. pneumoniae enzymes involved in siderophore biosynthesis might fall under this scenario since the transcriptomic and rts signals from genes involved in this process are much lower during stationary phase than during exponential phase. these findings emphasize the need for in-depth studies to validate targets before the start of an antibiotic discovery program, in particular to establish whether a potential target enzyme is ultimately produced under infection-relevant conditions.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, we report here the operational annotation of the klebsiella pneumoniae mgh  <dig> genome during exponential and stationary phase growth in glucose m <dig>  we identified numerous rtss, unannotated transcripts , different types of regulatory rnas, and putative orfs. additional experimental data to confirm the existence of srnas, antisense transcripts, and putative orfs would yield further insight into important mechanisms underlying transcriptional regulation of this important human pathogen.
