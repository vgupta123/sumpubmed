BACKGROUND
in addition to the importance in livestock production, the pig is a well-established biomedical model to study human health due to the genomic, anatomic and physiologic similarities with humans. a wide variety of human health traits including cancer, reproductive health, drug metabolism, wound healing, and cardiovascular disease have been successfully studied using the pig
 <cit> . underlying these and other important traits such as growth and development, feeding, stress, memory and susceptibility to substances abuse are neuropeptides, a class of cell-cell signaling peptides that have paracrine, endocrine, and autocrine effects
 <cit> . research in selected pig neuropeptides has offered insights into cell transplantation, nervous system diseases, and injury
 <cit> . for example, yang et al.
 <cit>  reported on the inhibitory effect of neuromedin s  on luteinizing hormone secretion which is mediated via melanocyte-stimulating hormone  neurons in the hypothalamus-pituitary axis of ovariectomized pigs. kaminski et al.
 <cit>  concluded that hypothalamic peptides, orexin a and orexin b, were involved in the control of food intake, sleep patterns, autonomic and neuroendocrine systems, and may also affect reproductive functions through the influence on the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis in pigs.

the identification of neuropeptides is more difficult than most proteins because neuropeptides are derived from larger prohormone proteins as a result of complex enzymatic processing. the conversion of the large prohormone to one or multiple smaller neuropeptides involves cleavage by multiple prohormone convertases and additional post-translational modifications such as amidation and glycosylation
 <cit> . this complex processing of prohormones into neuropeptides challenges the identification of neuropeptide genes across genomes solely based on sequence homology to better understood species
 <cit> .

only  <dig> prohormone and  <dig> prohormone convertase genes have been empirically confirmed in the pig compared to approximately  <dig> genes identified in human, rat, mouse, cow and rhesus monkey
 <cit> . this partial knowledge of the prohormone, prohormone convertase and associated neuropeptides in the pig is a critical shortcoming, especially considering the important role of pig in biomedical and agricultural research
 <cit> . in addition, few gene expression studies have discussed the expression profile of pig prohormone or prohormone convertase genes. ross et al.
 <cit>  found that estradiol treatment at day  <dig> of gestation was associated with changes in the expression of the prohormone neuromedin  in the endometrium of glits. hausman et al.
 <cit>  concluded that the expression of neuropeptide y  was down-regulated with age in gilts ranging from  <dig> to  <dig> days old.

understanding the role of neuropeptides in human and livestock traits using the pig as biomedical model requires a comprehensive knowledge of the neuropeptide complement in the recently released pig genome . this understanding includes the identification of prohormone and prohormone convertase genes, prediction of cleavage sites in prohormones that may result in potentially bioactive neuropeptides, and characterization of gene expression and protein abundance across conditions to gain insights into the role of neuropeptides. a complete survey of the prohormone and prohormone convertase genes in the pig supports the interpretation of gene expression experiments and improves the effectiveness of tandem mass spectrometry studies to identify neuropeptides
 <cit> . functional annotation of these genes can be obtained by the analysis of the large number of gene expression experiments already available
 <cit> . to address the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the prohormone and prohormone convertase genes in the pig, we present the first comprehensive survey and functional annotation of these genes. an all-inclusive catalogue of prohormone and prohormone convertase genes known in other species was used to search complementary pig genome databases. these genes were then characterized by analyzing a large number of gene expression experiments across a wide range of conditions. the potential cleavage sites of prohormones that can result in bioactive neuropeptides were predicted and compared to the cleavages based on known neuropeptide sequences.

RESULTS
pig prohormone genes
a comprehensive catalogue of  <dig> potential pig prohormone genes,  <dig> prohormone convertase genes and  <dig> prohormone convertase facilitator gene  were identified in the pig genome. table
 <dig> lists the genes and the corresponding blast matches on the pig genome, uniprot, gene and unigene databases. there are  <dig> previously unreported  prohormone genes in the pig and complete sequences where only partially or incomplete sequences have been previously reported. newly identified genes are intermedin , cortistatin , insulin-like  <dig> , orexigenic neuropeptide qrfp , prokineticin  <dig> , prolactin-releasing peptide , parathyroid hormone  <dig> , urocortin , urocortin  <dig> , urocortin  <dig> , and urotensin 2-related peptide . this search also identified two different calcitonin protein entries in public databases that are isoforms of other calcitonin genes. additional information on the comprehensive catalogue of genes is available [see additional file

table
 <dig> summarizes the evidence from various repositories supporting the  <dig> unique pig prohormone genes and  <dig> alternative sequences detected in this study. the genome-predicted prohormone genes are supported by  <dig> uniprot entries  including  <dig> sequences that have evidence at the protein level of which  <dig> have complete protein sequence and  <dig> have partial protein sequence. additionally,  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> prohormone genes detected are supported by transcript evidence from unigene, gene, and uniprot, respectively. two genes, apelin  and prok <dig>  are supported by evidence in uniprot and by est records unassigned to a unigene cluster. uniprot supporting information includes  <dig> entries from alternatively spliced calcitonin genes, preprocalcitonin gene-related peptide and calcitonin- <dig>  that have evidence at the protein and transcript levels, respectively. however, the calcitonin  <dig> is not assigned to a unigene cluster or ncbi gene identifier because no est matches the unique region of the reported sequence. the uniprot entry for prothyroliberin  refers only to the 3-amino acid thyroliberin peptide however, no pig est has been reported. only  <dig> genome predictions do not have supporting evidence in uniprot with  <dig> of these have supporting transcript evidence. complete protein sequences were predicted for insulin-like  <dig>  and endothelin- <dig>  and an incomplete protein sequence was predicted for prolactin-releasing peptide  genes. the nucleic and protein sequence of edn <dig> have been reported
 <cit>  but this information is not present in public databases. of the  <dig> uniprot predicted sequences,  <dig>  entries have  transcript support. there are  <dig> uniprot predicted sequences that correspond to genes that are absent in the pig genome studied. a partial match to ucn <dig> was found in the trace archives although this gene was not found in the pig genome assembly studied and lacks of external validation. progonadoliberin- <dig>  was not found in the current pig genome assembly although this gene was detected in earlier assembly versions and trace archives. this gene has no current experimental evidence outside homology to other mammalian species. the apparent lack of ucn <dig> and gon <dig> in the assembly and fragment evidence of other prohormones is most likely due to poor coverage of the genomic regions where these prohormone genes are located.

 <dig> uniprot evidence: “type of evidence that supports the existence of the protein”; protein : complete protein sequence; partial: incomplete protein sequence such as presence of a peptide; transcript: “existence of a protein has not been strictly proven but there is expression data  that indicate the existence of a transcript.”; predicted: complete or partial sequence of the protein has been predicted; not found: no match found in the uniprot database.

 <dig> genome: prediction of the protein sequence from the genome assembly: complete denotes full sequence, fragment denotes incomplete prediction and not found denotes no match.

 <dig> unigene present or not found denote whether the gene had any est evidence or not, respectively.

at least four calcitonin genes, also known as calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide genes, were identified with  <dig> genes exhibiting alternative splicing. the genome assembly permitted the assignment of the uniprot pre-procalcitonin  and preprocalcitonin gene-related peptide  entries to the same gene that also produces the uniprot calcitonin  and calcitonin gene-related peptide  peptides, respectively. this alternatively spliced gene corresponds to calca gene found in other mammalian species.

the bioinformatics gene prediction pipeline confirmed that the separate q766y <dig> and a0a <dig> uniprot entries are alternatively spliced variants of the same calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide  <dig>  gene as initially reported by rezaeian et al.
 <cit> . a single genome match was identified for calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide  <dig> . while the calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide  <dig>  gene has been reported, the actual gene may be inaccurately assembled in the  <dig>  genome release because the region appears to contain a small duplication leading to  <dig> starting locations. further supporting this argument, a conserved  <dig> amino acid region in all calcitonin receptor-stimulating peptide-related protein sequences matched to an additional 5th genome site which was part of a discontinued ncbi gene entry . there is insufficient information to conclude whether there is a separate coding gene involved or an assembly-related problem.

neuropeptide s  is a potential 12th prohormone gene discovered by the bioinformatics gene prediction pipeline. two genome matches on different chromosomes for the nps gene were identified. however, the complete identity of the matched between the predicted sequence and chromosomal locations implied that this was an assembly error rather than a duplication event. although uniprot has an partial pig nps entry , the genome predicted protein sequence was more similar to the bovine sequence, as expected, than the present partial uniprot pig sequence. the pig nps protein and nucleic sequences were found to be 100% and 99% identical, respectively, to the rabbit sequence . the similarity between the uniprot pig and rabbit sequences was also evident in the phylogenetic relationships among nps sequences reported by yao et al.
 <cit> . these findings call into question the present pig nps entry in uniprot. 

prohormone genes previously unreported in pig
the genome search identified  <dig> prohormone genes that do not have empirical confirmation in the uniprot, unigene or gene databases . these genes are adm <dig>  cort, insl <dig>  ox <dig>  prok <dig>  prrp, nps, tip <dig>  ucn <dig>  ucn <dig>  ucn <dig>  and uts2b. only inferred sequences are available for adm <dig> and cort in uniprot and the current pig nps entry is identical to the rabbit nps. there is evidence for mammalian homologs of all these genes in uniprot. the protocol followed to identify these genes included a high percentage of identities and similarities with a minimum percentage of mismatches and gaps and conservation of the region encompassing the potential neuropeptide. intermedin or adrenomedullin  <dig>  is part of the calcitonin family of peptides and has effects similar to those of adrenomedullin . in humans, intermedin causes hypotension when given peripherally and augments blood pressure and causes sympathetic activation when given to the central nervous system
 <cit> . this neuropeptide induces prolactin release, has anti-diuretic and natriuretic properties and reduces food intake. the amino acid sequences of cort and somatostatin  are highly similar and both reduce neuronal activity. in addition, cort has unique roles such as induction of slow-wave sleep, reduction of locomotor activity, and activation of cation selective currents not responsive to sms <cit> . although the function of insl <dig> is still being determined, high expression in the colon, as well as in the brain and hypothalamus, indicates roles in gut contractility and neuroendocrine signaling
 <cit> . likewise, the function of ox <dig> is still being elucidated, although studies in chicken confirm the orexigenic, appetite stimulating activity of this neuropeptide
 <cit> . takayanagi and onaka
 <cit>  demonstrated that prrp plays a role in control of energy metabolism and stress response. prokineticins are involved in tumorigenesis process  acting as a growth factor for cancer cells, an angiogenic and a chemotactic factor for pro-inflammatory neutrophils
 <cit> . nps has anxiolytic-like effects  and can induce arousal and wakefulness
 <cit> . tip <dig> and the corresponding receptor form a neuromodulator system and the anatomical distribution indicates a role in limbic, endocrine, viscerosensory, and auditory functions. this system has been postulated as potential drug target in anxiety, depression and chronic pain management
 <cit> . urocortins and their receptors has been found in the central nervous, digestive, reproductive, cardiovascular, immune and endocrine systems, suggesting a variety of roles including cardiovascular activity and cell survival
 <cit> . utsb <dig> is a paralog of urotensin  <dig>  that exerts similar biological effects including relaxation of muscles and reduction of blood pressure
 <cit> .

pig prohormone convertase genes
the sequence of  <dig> prohormone convertase genes and the 7b <dig> facilitator gene also known as secretogranin  <dig>  were identified in the pig genome . the uniprot and gene databases only had supporting evidence for pcsk <dig>  pcsk <dig>  and 7b <dig>  six additional prohormone convertase genes  that were previously unreported or not based on empirical evidence were identified. only transcript evidence supports the  <dig> prohormone convertase genes, meanwhile protein evidence is available for 7b <dig>  dai et al.
 <cit>  isolated pcsk <dig> from the ovary cdna library of a pregnant sow and renegar et al.
 <cit>  detected pcsk <dig> in the corpus luteum and brain of pregnant sows. also, mrna from pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> has been identified in the pituitary neurointermediate lobes of pigs
 <cit> . among the prohormone convertases, furin, pcsk <dig>  pcsk <dig>  pcks <dig> and pcsk <dig> do not have unigene entries. the present catalogue enhances the currently limited work on pig prohormone convertases.

functional characterization of the pig prohormone and prohormone convertase genes
analysis of the large number of microarray gene expression experiments enabled the first comprehensive characterization of the role of prohormone and prohormone convertase genes in biological processes in the pig. the results from these analyses augmented the understanding of the role of these genes on reproduction, health, growth, and other traits of importance to biomedical research and agricultural production.

the query of affymetrix porcine genome array identified  <dig> probes representing  <dig> prohormone and  <dig> prohormone convertase genes. table
 <dig> lists the total number of differentially expressed probes  within the seven experimental classes considered. a detailed distribution of the differential expression level of each probe and experiment is provided [see additional file
 <dig>  a discussion of the findings for the  <dig> groups with highest number of differentially expressed probes  is presented below. although neuropeptides expressed in the brain and the immune system interact with circulating cytokines to support two-way communications between the brain and immune system
 <cit> , we describe the profiles of prohormones in immune-related tissues separately from the brain and central nervous system tissues to facilitate the interpretation of results.

immune-related profiling
several studies have demonstrated that prohormone genes play an important role in pig immune response
 <cit> . this was evidenced by the high number of differentially expressed prohormone and prohormone convertase genes  among experiments that evaluated immune-response in blood, spleen, and lymph nodes . differentially expressed genes were: adml, augurin , cholecystokinin , crsp <dig>  endothelin- <dig> , galanin , galanin-like peptide , progonadoliberin- <dig> , insulin-like growth factor i , insulin-like growth factor ii , neuromedin-b , neuromedin-u , neuropeptide y , platelet-derived growth factor subunit a , proenkephalin-a , prorelaxin  <dig> , secretogranin- <dig> , secretogranin- <dig> , secretogranin- <dig> , sms, vascular endothelial growth factor c , vascular endothelial growth factor d , pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> 

in general, prohormone genes were under-expressed in pigs under immune challenge relative to the un-challenged controls. augn was differentially expressed in two experiments; gse7313
 <cit>  that profiled lymph nodes and gse14790
 <cit>  that profiled blood. in gse <dig>   <dig> day-old pigs were inoculated with porcine circovirus type  <dig> , a virus that is widely spread across pig farms, and gene expression was profiled at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> dpi. augn was over-expressed in un-inoculated pigs at  <dig> dpi relative to  <dig> dpi, regardless of inoculation and relative  <dig> dpi inoculated pigs . both contrasts indicate that the expression of augn increases with age and this trend is slower in pigs infected with pcv <dig>  in gse <dig>  the gene expression of seven week old piglets inoculated with salmonella typhimurium was profiled at  <dig> hours post inoculation ,  <dig> hpi,  <dig> hpi, and  <dig> days post inoculation . augn was over-expressed at  <dig> dpi relative to  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi . consistent with the differential expression in relation to immune-response observed in this study, augn is a putative tumor suppressor gene and is down-regulated in many cancers
 <cit> .

igf <dig>  a member of the insulin family and is involved in development and growth, was differentially expressed across immune-related experiments. igf <dig> was represented by  <dig> probes in the microarray platform and  <dig> probes were differentially expressed across experiments. five probes  and one probe  were differentially expressed in experiments gse14790
 <cit>  and gse7314
 <cit> , respectively. in gse <dig>  igf <dig> was under-expressed in non-inoculated piglets at  <dig> dpi relative to inoculated pigs at various days . in experiment gse <dig>  igf <dig> was over-expressed in pigs inoculated with salmonella choleraesuis at  <dig> dpi relative to non-inoculated pigs . these results are consistent with reports that igf <dig> is down-regulated in pigs immune-challenged with lipopolysaccharide
 <cit> .

scg <dig>  scg <dig>  scg <dig>  members of the secretogranin family, exhibited differential expression among immune-challenge experiments consistent with the known association of these genes with cell activation, cytotoxicity and microbial defense
 <cit> . probes on all  <dig> scgs exhibited differential expression on two immune-related experiments. scg <dig> and scg <dig> are differentially expressed in gse <dig> while scg <dig> was differentially expressed in gse11787
 <cit> . in gse <dig> scg <dig> was under-expressed in inoculated pigs relative to controls . these results are consistent with the lack of synthesis of endogenous granins in rat pc <dig> cells infected with recombinant vaccinia viruses
 <cit> . in gse <dig>  scg <dig> and scg <dig> were under-expressed in pigs inoculated with pcv <dig> relative to un-inoculated control pigs .

two members of the vascular endothelial growth factor family, vegfc and vegfd, were under-expressed in pcv <dig> inoculated pigs relative to control pigs  and also under-expressed at early stages  relative to later stages  in gse <dig>  in agreement with these findings, a loss of endothelial growth factor transcription and increase in pro-inflammatory indicators were reported in the endometrial lymphocytes of pigs at sites of fetal arrest
 <cit> .

npy  was under-expressed in pcv2-inoculated pigs relative to control pigs  and, within infection level, npy was under-expressed at earlier stages relative to  <dig> dpi in gse <dig>  consistent with these findings, the levels of npy mrna decreased in the blood of rats treated with vinblastine, an anti-cancer drug known to decrease the number of white blood cells of the immune system involved in defense
 <cit> . similarly, npy was found to decrease in cattle infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy
 <cit> .

adml was differentially expressed in gse14758-d and gse <dig>  in gse14758-d
 <cit> , adml was under-expressed in the mediastinal lymph nodes of pcv2-infected pigs relative to control pigs at  <dig> dpi . whereas, in gse <dig> adml was over-expressed at  <dig> dpi in the blood of pigs inoculated with salmonella choleraesuis relative to controls . the latter result is consistent with the up-regulation of adml gene expression and increases in systemic circulatory concentrations of adml in response to the onset and progression of trauma, infection, and sepsis
 <cit> . the apparent inconsistency between both experiments may be associated with the differential effects that adml has on cellular metabolism, immune function, endocrine function, and cardiovascular function.

of the  <dig> prohormone convertases available in the microarray platform, pcsk <dig> and pcsk <dig> were significantly differentially expressed  and pcsk <dig> was marginally significantly differentially expressed  in gse <dig>  pcsk <dig> was under-expressed in pcv2-inoculated pigs already at  <dig> dpi relative to  <dig> dpi, regardless of inoculation at the later stage . likewise, pcsk <dig> is under-expressed in pcv2-inoculated pigs relative to controls already at  <dig> dpi  and, within controls, pcsk <dig> was under-expressed at early stages  relative to  <dig> dpi . these results are in agreement with similar findings that furin, another prohormone convertase, was dysregulated in the immune cells of advanced human atherosclerotic plaques
 <cit>  and imply that prohormone convertase, like prohormone genes, are down regulated under immune challenges.

embryo and placenta profiling
in gse18641
 <cit> , igf <dig>  was over-expressed in pregnant sows relative to non-pregnant sows . in gse12705
 <cit> , igf <dig>  was over-expressed in earlier stages  relative to later stage  conceptuses . this igf <dig> profile is supported by pantaleon et al.
 <cit>  that showed that igf <dig> is needed in order for mouse embryos to progress from early stages to blastocyst stages. gupta et al.
 <cit>  reported that the expression of the embryo survival related gene igf <dig> increased with the addition of nonessential amino acids or phytohemaglutinin in pig embryos and blastocysts, respectively.

both penk probes were over-expressed in tubular and spherical conceptuses relative to filamentous conceptuses  in experiment gse12705
 <cit> . this is consistent with results that found penk mrna to increase linearly during gestation in the hippocampus of pigs
 <cit> . pthr was under-expressed in tubular and spherical relative to filamentous conceptuses  in experiment gse <dig>  this finding is supported by reports that pthr is present in higher concentrations in fetal pigs than in sows
 <cit> . vegfc is a representative of the vascular endothelial growth factor family of prohormones that have an important role in the survival and mitogenesis of endothelial cells and lymphaniogenesis and angiogenesis of embryos
 <cit> . vegfc was over-expressed in pregnant sows relative to non-pregnant sows  in experiment gse18641
 <cit> . this finding is supported by a study in the chicken, demonstrating that the chorioallantoic membrane  contained growth of embryonic microvessels stimulated by vegfc <cit> . the expression profile is also supported by the finding that in mice embryos, vegfc is required for successful lymphatic vasculature development and lymphatic endothelial cell migration
 <cit> .

brain and central nervous system
eleven differentially expressed prohormone genes were identified in experiments concerning the hypothalamus, thyroid, and olfactory bulb . these genes are adrenomedullin- <dig> , adml, c-type natriuretic peptide , cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript protein , igf <dig>  igf <dig>  npy, platelet-derived growth factor subunit a , prodynorphin , pthr, and vegfc.

adml was over-expressed in the immortalized porcine olfactory bulb neuroblasts relative to the non-neural epithelial cells  in experiment gse16855
 <cit> . this result is supported by a previous study that found that adml is important for regulation of proliferation and differentiation of neural stem/progenitor cells using the mouse olfactory bulb
 <cit> .

igf <dig> was over-expressed in the neuroblasts relative to non-neural epithelial cells  in experiment gse <dig>  this result is supported by a study in chickens showing that igf <dig> was expressed in the olfactory bulb
 <cit> . also, igf <dig>  was consistently over-expressed in the hypothalamus of male iberian pigs relative to all other seven breed-gender combinations  in experiment gse14739-h
 <cit> . npy was over-expressed  in neuroblasts relative to non-neuronal cells in gse <dig>  this result is consistent with reports that the olfactory bulb exhibit high levels of immunoreactive npy in the brain of pigs
 <cit>  and that npy may inhibit excitatory neurotransmission in the rat olfactory bulb
 <cit> . vegfc was over-expressed in neuroblasts relative to non-neuronal cells  in experiment gse <dig>  this result agrees with a 30% increase in dividing neuroblasts in olfactory bulb in culture stimulated with vegfc compared to controls reported by le bras et al.
 <cit> . pthlh was under-expressed in neuroblasts relative to non-neuronal cells  in gse <dig>  this finding is consistent with reports that pthlh may be a negative regulator in the differentiation of chondrocytes
 <cit> . pdgfa was over-expressed in neuroblasts relative to non-neuronal cells  in experiment gse <dig>  related to this result, fressinaud et al.
 <cit>  reported that platelet-derived growth factors increase the glutamine synthetase activity in astrocytes in the brain.

prediction of cleavage sites in pig prohormones
all  <dig> prohormone sequences were used to predict cleavage and confirm the prediction against known or predicted cleavage sites. these sequences were inferred to have  <dig> cleavage sites that resulting in a  <dig> % prevalence rate . most sites were cleaved at an arginine  such that the most frequently cleaved motifs were xxkr , rxxr  and xxrr , where x denotes any amino acid and k denotes lysine. there were 5%  c-terminal single r sites that were cleaved without a basic amino acid in the second and fourth positions preceding the cleavage site .

the performance of the cleavage prediction models is presented in table
 <dig>  the correct classification rate ranged from 82% to 92% indicating that a large proportion of the sites were accurately predicted across all models. the human cleavage prediction models had the best performance for most of the statistics followed by the mammalian model. the known motif model provided the highest number of true positive predictions but also the highest number of false positive predictions. the known motif model provided the highest sensitivity, 77%, indicating more than three quarters of the cleaved sites were correctly predicted as cleaved. however this model also provided the highest number of false positive predictions. consequently the known motif positive predictive power was 35% indicating that, on average, only 35% of sites predicted to be cleaved are expected to be true cleavage sites.

a performance criteria. true positives: number of correctly predicted cleaved sites; true negatives: number of correctly predicted non-cleaved sites; false positives: number of incorrectly predicted cleaved sites; false negatives: number of incorrectly predicted non-cleaved sites; correct classification rate: number of correctly predicted sites divided by the total number of sites; sensitivity : number of true positives divided by the total number of sites cleaved; specificity : number of true negatives divided by the total number of sites not cleaved; positive predictive power: number of true positives divided by the total number of sites predicted to be cleaved; negative predictive power: number of true negatives divided by the total number of sites predicted to not be cleaved; correlation coefficient: mathew’s correlation coefficient between observed and predicted cleavage; and auc: area under the receiver operator characteristic or roc curve relating sensitivity and 1-specificity.

b aa: models trained only on amino acids.

c aa prop: models trained with amino acids combined with the physicochemical properties of amino acids.

d ann: artificial neural network approach.

the human models provided the highest number of true negatives resulting in the best model performance compared to the known motif and mammalian models. the human artificial neural network models had approximately 60% positive predictive power indicating that most sites predicted as cleaved are expected to be true positives. although the human logistic models had lower sensitivity than their artificial neural network counterparts, the differences with the human artificial neural network model were only  <dig> cleaved and  <dig> non-cleaved sites. the high performance of the human models suggests that the cleavage of prohormones that result in potential biologically active neuropeptides in the pig is similar to humans. noteworthy is that the mammalian model was trained on  <dig> mammalian prohormones that included  <dig> pig prohormones. this model provided slightly more true positive predictions and a higher sensitivity than the human logistic model. however, the mammalian model had noticeably more false positive predictions than the human logistic model resulting in lower performance in the other accuracy measures.

the comparison of results across models also provides information on the accuracy of the cleavage assignment, prediction accuracy and potential for a gene to produce bioactive peptides. for  <dig> prohormones, at least  <dig> of the models did not predict any cleavage site. however, it must be noted that  <dig> of the prohormones  are likely to have sites cleaved by proteases other than prohormone convertases. for example, anf is cleaved by corin, serine peptidase 
 <cit> .

genes with no predicted cleavage or assigned cleavage that differ from other species can be used to identify proteins are not cleaved to form smaller peptides. there is no evidence for cleavage of ucn <dig> and ucn <dig> to produce mature peptides in mammals
 <cit> . all models failed to predict two cleavage sites in tor2x. the first site, an n-terminal dibasic ‘rk’, is known to be rarely cleaved across species
 <cit> . the second site is a cleavage found in humans that forms alpha- and beta-salusin but this site may not be cleaved in the pig since the pig sequence, like the bovine sequence, only has a single basic site instead of the human dibasic ‘rr’ site. similarly for tkn <dig>  the genomic prediction and supporting est data indication a change from an r in other species to a glycine amino acid in the pig sequence that may prevent the formation of the ‘hemokinin’ peptide.

the pig crsp <dig> protein sequence lacks the ‘kr’ and a c-terminal cleavage site that are cleaved in human calc and calcb genes to produce calcitonin gene-related peptide  <dig> and calcitonin gene-related peptide  <dig>  therefore it is unlikely that pig crsp <dig> would provide these calcitonin peptides. the assigned cleavages in the res <dig> protein are necessary to provide a potential triskadecapeptide peptide reported by bloomquist et al.
 <cit> . this potential peptide has flanking dibasic cleavage sites in the mouse and rat but this peptide has not been experimentally confirmed. the corresponding region in human, bovine and pig sequences are monobasic and lack common pc cleavage motifs suggesting that these species probably cannot form this peptide.

examination of the potential cleavage sites in iapp indicated that a mutation from r to q in the n-terminal cleavage site is necessary to produce the islet amyloid polypeptide. examination of the corresponding ests indicated that  <dig> swine ests  were 100% identical to the rat genome and consequently invalid sequences. two other ests  matched the region that supported the genomic prediction. the predicted protein sequence including the potential cleavages sites of the expected iapp was less than 80% identical to other mammals sequences compared to typically over 85% identity between the human and most other mammalian sequences. potter et al.
 <cit>  questioned the capability of iapp to form amyloids after examining the functionality of a synthesized pig sequence based on the  est sequence. the predicted prohormone sequence and cleavage prediction results also strongly suggest that the pig is unlikely to be able to form iapp. this reflects the importance of proteomic studies involving cleavage to first determine that a species can produce a peptide.

CONCLUSIONS
the pig is an important biomedical and agricultural research species. results from the first genome-wide study of pig prohormone and prohormone convertase genes, functional annotation and prediction of prohormone cleavage have been presented. this study was enabled by the availability of the pig genome sequence and of  <dig> gene expression experiments that evaluated a wide range of conditions in pigs. these results offer more insights into the role of neuropeptides on biological processes such as reproduction, development, growth, and health and support targeted empirical confirmation. the bioinformatics pipeline used in this study can be used to identify prohormones or other sets of genes in species with similar sequence resources. confirmatory insight into the pig prohormones can be expected from proteomic mass spectrometry studies.

combining complementary bioinformatic resources,  <dig> prohormone genes,  <dig> prohormone convertases and one cleavage facilitator were discovered in the pig genome and raw sequence repositories. we uncovered  <dig> prohormone genes that have not been previously reported and one potentially incorrectly reported. the high performance of the models used to predict cleavage in the pig prohormones suggests that the prohormone cleavage in pigs is similar to humans. the analysis of  <dig> gene expression experiments identified various neuropeptide genes differentially expressed in immune-related tissues, embryo and placenta and the central nervous system including augn, igf <dig>  the family of scgs, npy, adm and adml, penk, pthr, and vegfc. experiments are required to confirm that the pig does not produce the bioactive neuropeptides ucn <dig>  ucn <dig>  tor2x, tkn <dig>  iapp, and crsp <dig> as suggested by the cleavage prediction models.
