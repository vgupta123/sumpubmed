BACKGROUND
xenorhabdus species are symbiotic bacteria associated with insectivorous nematodes of the genus steinernema  they reside in a specialized segment of the nematode gut  <cit> , and provide insecticidal proteins  <cit>  and small molecules  <cit>  that help to kill the insect larvae that are the prey of the nematode. both organisms reproduce in the dead larvae, the xenorhabdus colonize the young nematodes, and the cycle repeats  <cit> . xenorhabdus are closely related to the enteric gamma proteobacteria such as escherichia coli  <cit> , and are an emerging model for both mutualism and pathogenicity in invertebrate hosts. to better understand the genetic basis of these relationships, we are sequencing the genomes of two xenorhabdus species: x. nematophila atcc  <dig> and an x. bovienii strain from monsanto's collection.

in the course of this work, we found that the x. nematophila genome contained large numbers of highly repetitive dna regions, and efforts to finish the genome stalled. we sought a means to produce whole-genome maps for comparison with the genomic dna sequence, and identified optical mapping as a useful means to align and orient the genome sections in silico. in addition, we produced an optical map of a second genome that we had considered finished, and identified a large sequence inversion that would have otherwise been unnoticed.

RESULTS
a whole-genome restriction map permits finishing of the x. nematophila genome sequence
eight-fold genome sequence coverage of x. nematophila atcc <dig>  was generated, with  <dig>  reads from a 2– <dig> kb insert library and  <dig>  reads from a 4– <dig> kb insert library. this yielded an initial assembly consisting of  <dig> contiguous sequences  greater than  <dig> kb,  <dig> contigs greater than  <dig> kb, and  <dig> contigs greater than  <dig> kb length. our initial research had shown the presence of a  <dig> kb plasmid in addition to the circular chromosome .

it became rapidly clear that multiple areas of repeated sequence were causing problems. in fact, the final x. nematophila sequence assembly shows a nearly identical  <dig> kb region found on both the plasmid and chromosome, many transposons  scattered throughout the genome, and seven rrna regions. using the paired clone-end sequences and syntenic comparison to the related species photorhabdus luminescens  <cit> , resolution of misassembles and gap closure was attempted by walking across individual clones and amplifying potentially adjacent regions using the polymerase chain reaction . the resulting assembly contained over  <dig> contigs, but most lacked linkage information from gap-spanning paired ends. multiplex pcr resolved some gaps, but provided no indication about whether the amplified product was actually the correct size, whether a particular gap was resistant to amplification, or whether a reaction failed because the primers were not properly paired to cross a gap. after four months of concerted effort, the assembly still contained  <dig> contigs which collectively contained several hundred copies of transposons plus seven ribosomal rna coding regions. given this complexity, optical mapping was attempted to provide a structural scaffold for aligning and orienting the contigs.

optical mapping permits assembly of whole-genome restriction endonuclease maps by digesting immobilized dna molecules and determining the size and order of fragments  <cit> . in collaboration with opgen technologies , optical maps of x. nematophila atcc <dig> were produced using aflii and eagi restriction enzymes. through repeated overlapping of restriction maps from individual molecules , opgen's assembler program reconstructed the ordered restriction map of the genome  <cit> .

each restriction map produced by optical mapping was aligned with the restriction map predicted from the x. nematophila genome sequence. the map permitted alignment and orientation of all  <dig> contigs, and identification of misassemblies, allowing production of pcr products to cover all remaining gaps in the sequence . once the optical map was available, pcr, sequencing, and validation of the final assembly were accomplished in approximately one month. the map also detected several regions of misassembled sequence, including a plasmid that was integrated into the chromosomal sequence among the assembled contigs . the plasmid shares a highly conserved stretch of sequence with the chromosome , and this duplication led to the in silico misassembly. the final sequenced genome aligned directly to the restriction map generated by optical mapping .

optical mapping identifies an assembly error in the x. bovienii sequence
in addition to x. nematophila, we had previously sequenced and assembled the genome of the related organism x. bovienii using traditional finishing technologies. although the x. bovienii genome does not contain as many repeats as that of x. nematophila, the x. nematophila project had shown the value of non-sequence-based methodologies in validating sequence assemblies. after generating an optical map for x. bovienii  using afliii, a large inversion was detected in the sequence assembly, permitting a simple re-orientation of the data and correction of the genome sequence . it is doubtful that this assembly inversion would have been detected without the optical map.

discussion
the xenorhabdus genomes analyzed in this project contain many highly repetitive regions, and these became a major obstacle in our attempts to assemble the genome sequences. genome finishing traditionally relies on cosmid libraries or overlapping restriction maps of bacs to build larger meta-contigs. with the x. nematophila genome the traditional approach failed, and we used a genome-scale restriction map generated by optical mapping. this permitted rapid and accurate closing of x. nematophila, and provided savings of labor, reagents and time. finishing the x. nematophila genome sequence would have otherwise required production of a fine-scale genetic-physical map at much greater cost in time and materials. optical mapping also identified an inversion in the x. bovienii genome sequence assembly that we  had considered finished.

high throughput processes like dna sequencing normally require trade-offs among cost, speed, and data quality. sequencing costs are being reduced, and speed increased, by novel methods such as the pyrosequencing technology of  <dig> life sciences  <cit> . however,  <dig> technology produces shorter sequences  than traditional sanger sequencing using abi instrumentation . these shorter 454-derived sequences mean that sequence contigs are also, on average, shorter than those produced using abi instruments. however, the lower quality of sequence assemblies from  <dig> data is compensated by speed and cost considerations. excluding the cost of purchasing the instrumentation and labor, a typical  <dig> mb bacterial genome takes approximately  <dig> days and costs about $ <dig>  in consumables using  <dig>  the same genome sequence produced by abi instrumentation would cost approximately 10-fold more and take several weeks. in our experience, a typical  <dig> mb assembly using  <dig> data would contain about 80– <dig> contigs, with an average length around 60– <dig> kb. a similar genome assembled using data from abi  <dig> instruments would contain about  <dig> contigs with an average length > <dig> kb. both strategies would typically add about  <dig>  end-paired sequences from cosmids or phosmids to help scaffold the genome, at a cost of about another $ <dig> .

the current cost for an optical map with a single enzyme is approximately $ <dig> , and adding a second enzyme costs around another $ <dig>  . the optical mapping system can accurately quantify fragments down to about  <dig> kb in size, and a contig of  <dig> kb has an approximately 80% probability of being placed within a whole genome optical map . when all of these data are combined, a  <dig> shotgun sequence plus cosmid end sequences and an optical map, can produce an assembled and oriented set of contigs containing about 95% of the genome for under $ <dig>  with very limited input by a human finisher. this is about one-fifth the cost of a project produced through traditional means, provides very high quality data, and puts production of finished bacterial genomes within the reach of even small labs. we are currently working on a genome produced in this manner that will be primarily closed using undergraduate researchers supported by some bioinformatics infrastructure.

CONCLUSIONS
even on these relatively small genomes, the whole-genome maps were very valuable. in the x. nematophila project, we had the advantages of long sequence reads and clone end-pairing data, yet still were unable to assemble contigs because of the presence of numerous highly repetitive sequences. the optical map allowed rapid closure of one genome and identified an assembly error in a fully-assembled genome sequence that gave no prior indication of having errors.

as shotgun sequencing costs come down, the optical map becomes a significant portion of the budget for a new bacterial genome sequence. however, for genomes that contain particularly large numbers of repetitive sequences, require finishing, or simply require ordered and oriented contigs from shotgun sequence, an optical map can increase the speed and decrease the overall cost of the project. we also expect that mapping costs will come down as optical mapping becomes more routinely used by sequencing centers, and as resolution of fragment size moves toward the 1– <dig> kb range. we now routinely confirm the in silico assemblies of bacterial genomes using a whole-genome restriction map, and believe this is a relatively low cost method to speed finishing and ensure accuracy of finished bacterial genome sequences.
