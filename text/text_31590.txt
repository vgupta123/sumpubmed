BACKGROUND
copy number variation  is very common in human genome
 <cit> . among the many genes affected by cnv, the beta-defensin genes  which are located in chromosome 8p <dig>  have been well characterized to be extensively variable in populations
 <cit> . these defbs form a cluster, and  <dig> to  <dig> copies of defb cluster were reported in a diploid genome
 <cit> . there is a correlation between copy number  and defb <dig> expression at mrna level in a variety of cells
 <cit>  i.e. cn are prone to shape phenotypes.

beta-defensins are a group of cationic antimicrobial peptides. they are mainly expressed in skin and mucus and can be strongly induced after infection, so beta-defensins are considered to contribute to the first line of defense against invading pathogens
 <cit> . in addition, beta-defensins are able to modulate the immune response
 <cit> .

given the functions of beta-defensins in the immune system, researchers have investigated the association between defb cn and inflammatory diseases. increased defb cn was reported to be associated with the risk of psoriasis
 <cit> . fellerman et al. found an association between low defb cn and crohn’s disease of colon
 <cit> . on the contrary, bentley et al. reported an association between high defb cn and crohn’s disease
 <cit> . however, none of the associations can be replicated in a recent study by aldhous et al.
 <cit>  which is in main part due to uncertainty in cn determination. the discrepancies raised the necessity to find reliable methods for defb cn determination.

so far, it is still a challenge to determine the exact defb cn. three pcr based methods, real-time pcr 
 <cit> , paralog ratio tests 
 <cit>  and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification 
 <cit>  have being extensively used to determine defb cn. qpcr was advantageous due to universal applicability and relative simplicity, but the reliability of this method was questioned
 <cit> . prt was designed to avoid the pcr heterogeneity between reference and target genes by using one pair of primers targeting paralogs of a pseudogene
 <cit> . combined with simplicity and high throughput, prt is becoming more and more popular, and different designs were used
 <cit> . mlpa has the capacity to interrogate a great deal of locus including target and reference in a single reaction
 <cit> . nevertheless, it is relatively expensive and time-consuming and requires larger amounts of sample dna. when the cns determined by these three methods were compared directly in the same samples, inter-method inconsistencies were observed frequently
 <cit> . therefore, in this study we asked which one is superior among the three methods for defb cn determination. to answer this question, we compared qpcr, prt and mlpa for defb cn determination in  <dig> dna samples. furthermore we investigated the reason for inconsistent cn determination by prt compared to by mlpa.

RESULTS
integer cn assignment and call rate
in order to compare the performance of qpcr, prt <dig> and mlpa, defb cns were determined in dna from blood of  <dig> healthy europeans . to evaluate the distribution of the raw data of each method individually, the raw cns of all samples from qpcr , the raw cns of a typical 96-well plate from prt <dig> and the relative locus dose of a typical batch from mlpa were plotted in an ascending order . the distributions of the raw cns of the other prt <dig> plates and the relative locus dose of the other mlpa batches are shown in additional file
 <dig> and additional file
 <dig>  respectively. in qpcr, the raw cns are distributed continuously, and no clustering around integer cns was observed. in contrast, for mlpa the relative locus dose increases stepwise and clear intervals between neighboring cn clusters are visible as shown in the plot as “gaps”. for prt <dig>  a plot between these two extremes was obtained.

for qpcr, raw cn were rounded to the nearest integer. for prt <dig> and mlpa, a clustering algorithm was applied creating likelihood values for integer assignments. in figure 
 <dig>  the clustering results of a typical 96-well plate/batch were shown for prt <dig> and mlpa, respectively. the distribution of raw data around the cluster centers is broader for prt <dig> than for mlpa. accordingly, the likelihood value of prt <dig> was significantly lower than that of mlpa . moreover,  <dig> % of the samples did not pass the threshold of likelihood in prt <dig>  in contrast, all but two samples passed in mlpa.

the qpcr and prt <dig> assays were performed twice and samples were considered if the results from the duplicates were consistent. the call rate of mlpa was with  <dig> % the highest among three methods in contrast to qpcr  and prt <dig> . among uncalled samples in prt <dig>   <dig> % showed an mpla-cn ≥  <dig> 

inter-method concordance and discordance
concordance and discordance between methods were evaluated by pairwise comparison of cns . for visualization of the inter-method difference, bland-altman plots were applied . the concordance rates among three method pairs were significantly different . the concordance rate between mlpa and prt <dig>  was the highest. accordingly, the range of limit of agreement between mlpa and prt <dig>  is the smallest. in comparison to mlpa, qpcr underestimated the cn , with greater underestimation at higher cn. when prt <dig> and qpcr cns were compared, we observed a very similar trend.

comparing mlpa and prt <dig>  in all  <dig> discordant cases  the prt underestimated the cn by  <dig>  in addition, a linear trend between cn and the fraction of underestimated samples is very likely .

genomic variation in a prt <dig> primer binding site
as the discordance between mlpa and prt <dig> could be confirmed for selected samples repeatedly, we speculated that prt <dig> may systematically miss a particular target allele in the defb region. therefore,  <dig> samples discordant between mlpa and prt <dig> were selected for variation screening in the prt <dig> primer binding sites by sequencing. a c > t paralogous sequence variation  was found in the forward primer binding site in  <dig> samples . the variant was not found among  <dig> clones obtained from the genomic dna pool which indicates a significant difference in the rs <dig> minor allele frequency  among random samples and those  <dig> selected for their mlpa/prt <dig> discordance . to test whether the t allele was missed in prt <dig>   <dig> clones containing t allele amplicons from rc <dig> and rc <dig> and  <dig> clones containing c allele amplicons from rc <dig> and rc <dig> identified by sequencing were used as test samples and control samples, respectively. the result indicates that the t allele cannot be amplified by the prt <dig> pcr , even in the artificial condition of an extremely low complexity and high-copy template.

cn distributions from three methods
compared to the cn distribution obtained by mlpa, the qpcr and prt <dig> patterns are shifted towards low cns . although the medians from the three methods were all  <dig>  they were statistically different . multiple comparisons qpcr vs prt <dig>  qpcr vs mlpa and prt <dig> vs mlpa also showed significant differences .

discussion
in the present study, we compared the call rates and concordance of qpcr, prt <dig> and mlpa for the defb cn determination. we herewith extended a previous study
 <cit>  where qpcr and mlpa were explored on  <dig> cell line and  <dig> blood derived samples. in the present study, we included a prt as respective approaches which are combining simplicity and high throughput and becoming popular in the field
 <cit> . moreover, we extended the test sample considerably to  <dig> dnas isolated from blood of healthy donors with european ancestry. furthermore, a clustering algorithm was used to infer the integer cn from raw data in prt <dig> and mlpa with a threshold of confidence.

in respect to raw data, we found the best convergence for mlpa. “gaps” of locus dose between neighboring clusters provide discriminatory power to the method resulting in higher confidence for the cn estimation compared to prt <dig>  nearly no clustering of raw data at all was observed for qpcr, which confirmed the findings of previous reports
 <cit> . it results in frequent typing errors and serious shortcomings of this method. qpcr systematically underestimated in particular higher cns, which confirmed our results in a previous report
 <cit> .

for this study, we developed a clustering algorithm with confidence of determination to infer cn from raw data of prt <dig> and mlpa. to infer cn from raw data, rounding to the nearest integer
 <cit> , linear regression by integrating reference samples
 <cit>  and gaussian mixture modeling
 <cit>  were used. signal saturation as the cn increases was reported in pprt and mlpa
 <cit> . so directly rounding the raw data to the nearest integer may underestimate the cn, and linear regression may overestimate or underestimate the cn. gaussian mixture modeling was well established for cn calling from large data sets. for small data sets, however, cn calls will be biased particularly for high cns due to the low data amount in the clusters to form gaussian curves. in extreme cases of no data in one or even more clusters, the gaussian curves for adjacent clusters will be remarkably affected and cns will be misestimated eventually. in the prt <dig> and mlpa assays, to completely avoid variations between plates or batches, analysis was performed in a plate- or batch- wise manner, so the data sets were too small to call cns using the gaussian mixture model. in addition, due to differences between primary cluster centers determined from reference samples and actual cluster centers determined from the test samples, cns called by gaussian mixture modeling using reference samples will also be misestimated. in contrast, these misestimations can be avoided by the developed clustering approach, which furthermore allows setting a threshold of confidence enhancing the reliability of the determination.

mlpa had the highest call rate of > 99%, which is higher than that reported in triplex prt  in which also a likelihood analysis with a threshold of confidence was applied
 <cit> . in contrast, the prt <dig> applied by us had a considerably lower call rate  especially for high cns. it was considered that loss of large amount of data or/and biased loss of data between cases and controls could generate spurious associations in cnv association studies
 <cit> . in case of qpcr, the initial low call rate of 84% could be increased by a second run to almost 97%. possibly, the call rate of prt <dig> could also be increased by repeating the assay several times, but in contrast to qpcr it is time and labor consuming.

accordingly, we found a high concordance rate between mlpa and prt <dig> but a lower one between mlpa or prt <dig> and qpcr. most of the mlpa and prt <dig> cns agreed except  <dig> cases where prt <dig> missed exactly one defb copy. we could explain this phenomenon by identifying a psv in the prt <dig> forward primer which completely abolished amplification from defb clusters containing the minor t allele. unknown during the assay design and the course of the work it turned out to be identified recently by the  <dig> genomes project as rs <dig>  although no minor allele frequency was reported yet. missing this psv among  <dig> clones from the dna pool of  <dig> individual dna indicates that it is a low-frequency variation. in respect to the  <dig> samples with both mlpa cns and prt <dig> cns in the present study, comprising altogether  <dig> copies of the defb cluster, the minor psv allele frequency is  <dig> %. assuming a random distribution of this psv allele among defb cn alleles  would result in linearly increased frequency of samples underestimated with copy numbers, e.g. the probability to underestimate a cn by  <dig> is four times higher for a 8-copy genome compared to a 2-copy genome. this assumption is supported by the linear trend between cn and the frequency of samples underestimated we observed  although the sample size  is small.

most remarkably, the cn distributions of the three methods differed significantly. among them, the distribution from mlpa is very comparable to the recently reported distribution obtained by triplex prt in european populations
 <cit> . the distribution from qpcr shifted to low cns due to underestimation of cns, whereas a similar shift for prt <dig> is caused by its low call rate at high cns and underestimation by one copy in the samples carrying the psv rs <dig> at the primer binding site.

there are several advantages of mlpa over prt and/or qpcr in design. the first is given by the usage of several markers. ten markers within the defb cluster and  <dig> single-copy reference loci were used to interrogate the cn in mlpa in contrast to only one marker in qpcr and prt <dig>  different behaviors of different markers inducing discrepant cn estimations were reported for qpcr
 <cit>  and prt
 <cit> . therefore, in our opinion the combination of numerous markers is a crucial prerequisite to achieve a comprehensive and accurate estimation of cn by avoiding bias from single markers. this assumption is supported by the cn determination with triplex prt
 <cit> . in this method, three markers were included and raw data showed good convergence around the cluster centers. moreover, cns from triplex prt were consistent with those from mlpa in a panel of dna samples . based on this assumption, the prt <dig> assay could be combined with other assays, e.g. previously established prts
 <cit>  to avoid the bias from the psv rs <dig> in primer binding site and further improve the performance for cn determination.

another advantage of mlpa is evident from the described prt <dig> cn determination problem due to a psv at the primer binding site. mlpa probe targeting sites are usually located in functional genes which are under strong negative selection and whose variations are well characterized. furthermore, it was shown that variations at the probe hybridization site only influence its efficiency if positions directly adjacent to the ligation site are affected
 <cit> . however, in prt <dig>  the pseudogene hspdp <dig> is the target and a psv in the primer binding site in one copy of the defb clusters resulted in complete pcr dropout of respective copy and consequent underestimation of cn of samples. pseudogenes, especially retrotransposed pseudogenes lacking active promoters, represent putatively unconstrained sequences which are accumulating variations due to the lack of selection pressure
 <cit> . snp density and ka/ks ratios of pseudogenes are significantly higher than those of genes
 <cit>  and, overall, variation in pseudogenes is less well characterized because they are not common targets of resequencing projects as genes are. accordingly, it is likely that unknown variations may compromise primer binding sites. furthermore, processes like gene conversion and/or non-allelic homologous recombination between different pseudogenes of the same family  may further increase the genetic variability within primer binding sites. in addition, the high annealing temperatures applied to ensure the pcr specificity make the prt assays susceptible to the sequence variations in primer binding sites. the problem in prt <dig> is also seen with the prt applied for the estimation of defb cn
 <cit> . we identified rs <dig> as being present on one defb copy in the hapmap/ceph sample na <dig> causing underestimation of its cn by one 
 <cit> . in addition, the psv rs <dig> interfering with our prt <dig> assay is also located within the reverse primer binding site of hspd21-prt
 <cit>  although at the 5’ end. therefore, it is possible that the low call rate in prt <dig> is due to additional primer binding site variants in the target locus and/or its paralogs on other chromosomes. altogether, these results suggest that pseudogenes should be avoided as targets for paralog ratio tests whenever possible.

CONCLUSIONS
although expensive and time consuming, mlpa is superior to qpcr and prt <dig> for defb cn determination. if accuracy has the highest priority, it is the best method to be applied in association studies and the raw data should be subjected to cluster analysis using thresholds of confidence.
