BACKGROUND
endophytic bacteria reside within the living tissue of their host plants without substantively harming it  <cit> . they can be beneficial to their host by promoting plant growth or acting as biocontrol agents  <cit> . serratia plymuthica is ubiquitously distributed in nature, and most frequently associated with plants. this organism has been isolated from the rhizosphere and the phyllosphere of various plants, as an endophyte from the endorhiza of potato  <cit> , or as a contaminant in a raw vegetable processing line  <cit> . over the last two decades, s. plymuthica has received steadily increasing attention as a biocontrol agent for mainly fungal diseases. based on the international approved german directive , it is nowadays classified within the risk group  <dig> by the dsmz , indicating that the species does not pose a threat to human health  <cit> .

quorum-sensing  plays a central role within a number of bacterial gene regulatory networks by controlling gene expression in a population-dependent manner with the aid of small diffusible signal molecules  <cit> . in gram-negative bacteria, n-acylhomoserine lactones  are the best described qs signal molecules. ahls are made by luxi homologues and, when they reach a critical threshold concentration, activate their cognate luxr-type regulators which in turns induce or repress multiple gene expression. qs systems are involved in various physiological processes in bacteria, including bioluminescence, conjugation, symbiosis, virulence and biofilm formation  <cit> . biofilms are increasingly recognized as the predominant form of bacterial growth in the environment  <cit> . growth in a biofilm provides many advantages for bacteria, including enhanced resistance to environmental stresses, such as desiccation and antimicrobials, as well as to host defenses  <cit> . it has been well documented that a number of plant beneficial rhizobacteria employ ahls as signal molecules to regulate biocontrol activities including the triggering of systemic resistance in host plants and the production of antifungal compounds  <cit> . the phenotypes regulated by ahls in serratia species are remarkably diverse and of profound biological and ecological significance. these include motility and biofilm formation, production of antibiotics, exoenzymes and butanediol fermentation, synthesis of the plant growth promoting auxin indole-3-acetic acid  and promotion of plant colonisation and biocontrol against several plant diseases  <cit> . however, the role of ahl-mediated qs system in the endophytic strains of plant associated serratia is less well understood.

quorum quenching can been achieved by degrading ahl signal compounds using lactonases or acylases and has been shown to interfere with expression of ahl-regulated traits, such as virulence in erwinia carotovora, erwinia amylovora  <cit> , burkholderia thailandensis  <cit> , burkholderia cepacia complex  <cit> , and pseudomonas aeruginosa  <cit> ; or biocontrol activity in rhizospheric serratia plymuthica hro-c <dig>  <cit> . aiia-dependent signal degradation is a particularly useful tool to study the impact of quorum sensing in gram-negative bacteria having multiple ahl regulatory circuits without the need to make mutants in the different ahl synthase genes  <cit> .

in this study we describe the initial characterisation of two ahl-mediated qs systems in the wheat stem endophyte serratia plymuthica g <dig>  <cit> . two luxir homologue genes, splir and spsir were identified from this strain, their ahl profiles characterised and their role in biocontrol traits were determined. the results presented show that whilst the control of some biocontrol traits by ahls is conserved in distinct s. plymuthica isolates, the regulation of motility and biofilm formation is strain specific and possibly linked to the original environment of the isolate. these results provide new insights into the regulation of beneficial interactions between endophytic serratia strains, pathogens and host plants and will help with the understanding of the inconsistencies in their biocontrol performance.

methods
microorganisms, media and growth conditions
the bacterial, fungal strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in table  <dig>  s. plymuthica g <dig> was isolated from the stems of wheat  in taian, shandong, china. a spontaneous mutant resistant to rifampicin was selected for further experiments. s. plymuthica g <dig>  its derivatives and the biosensor chromobacterium violaceum cv <dig>  <cit>  were grown in lb medium at 28°c and stored at -80°c in 25% glycerol. when required, antibiotics were added at final concentrations of  <dig> μg/ml for ampicillin,  <dig> μg/ml for carbenicillin,  <dig> μg/ml for rifampicin, and  <dig> μg/ml for tetracycline. all antibiotics were purchased from sigma. the fungal isolate cryphonectria parasitica was from the authors' laboratory collection and was routinely cultured on potato dextrose agar   at 25°c.

dna preparation and manipulations
standard methods were used for plasmid and genomic dna isolation, restriction enzyme digestion, agarose gel electrophoresis, ligation, and transformation  <cit> .

phylogenetic analysis
to gain a better taxonomic understanding of the serratia g <dig> isolate a 16s rdna-based phylogenetic tree was compiled using the neighbour-joining method of mega  <dig>  the 16s rrna gene sequence from the g <dig> isolate, we recently published elsewhere  <cit>  was analysed together with those from other members of the genus serratia, including the s. plymuthica dsm  <dig> type strain as a reference and the related strains s. proteamaculans dsm  <dig>  s. ficaria dsm  <dig>  s. entomophila dsm  <dig>  s. odorifera dsm  <dig>  s. marcescens dsm  <dig>  as well as s. plymuthica rvh <dig> from a raw vegetable processing line and an endophytic strain ja <dig> isolated from ginseng plants. in addition, escherichia coli atcc  <dig> as an outgroup. these 16s rrna sequences were obtained from genbank. the tree topology was tested by bootstrap analysis of  <dig> samplings.

cloning and sequencing of two pairs of luxir homologues from s. plymuthica strain g3
production of ahl signal molecules in strain g <dig> was detected using a t-streak assay with c. violaceum cv <dig> on plates. the following two pairs of primers for the cloning the splir and spsri loci were designed to the conserved regions of the corresponding genes in the genus serratia using the clustalw multiple sequence alignment program: splir-f: 5'-tttgtagaataccggcaagctgtt -3' and splir-r: 5'-cagatcgtcacggagcctgt-3'; spsri-f:5'-gagagggttcagtgtcaaat-3' and spsri-r: 5'-ccatggaagatgtagaaatg-3'. these genes were amplified using g <dig> genomic dna as a template by pcr and cloned into pmd-19t . the clones expressed the ahl synthases spli or spsi in e. coli dh5α were selected by t-streak with c. violaceum cv <dig> for further identification of ahl profiles, and confirmed by pcr and sequencing . a neighbour-joining tree of luxi family members was produced using the mega  <dig>  amino acid sequences of spli and spsi from the g <dig> isolate were aligned and analysed together with luxi homologs from other eight members of serratia and esai from pantoea stewartii dc <dig>  trai of agrobacterium vitis s <dig> was tested as outgroup. these amino acid sequences of luxi homologs were obtained from genbank. confidence in neighbour-joining tree was determined by analysing  <dig> bootstrap replicates.

ahl degradation by heterologous expression of the aiia acyl-homoserine lactonase
a quorum-quenching approach was used to identify ahl-regulated biocontrol-related phenotypes in the endophytic strain g <dig>  e. coli s17-1/pme <dig> carrying the ahl-lactonase aiia from the bacillus sp. strain a <dig> under the control of the constitutive lac promotor  <cit>  was used to mobilise aiia into g <dig> by conjugation to obtain g3/pme6863-aiia. g <dig> containing pme <dig> was used as a control. transconjugants were selected on lb plates containing  <dig> μg/ml of tetracycline and  <dig> μg/ml of rifampicin. inactivation of the ahls produced by strain g <dig> was evaluated by t-streak with the c. violaceum cv <dig> biosensor strain and further confirmed by lc-ms/ms analysis as described below.

extraction of ahls from culture supernatants
for extraction of signal molecules, all tested bacteria were grown in  <dig> ml of lb overnight at 28°c with shaking. cell-free culture supernatants  were extracted twice with equal volumes of ethyl acetate after which the extracted organic phases were pooled. the solvent was removed under vacuum and the resulting extract reconstituted in acetonitrile prior to lc-ms/ms analysis.

identification of ahl profiles by lc-ms/ms
ahls were examined by lc-ms/ms in the centre for analytical bioscience, school of pharmacy, university of nottingham, uk. briefly, the mobile phase a  was  <dig> % formic acid in water  and mobile phase b   <dig> % formic acid in acetonitrile . two shimadzu lc-10advp pumps in binary mode were run at  <dig>  ml/min using the gradients as follows: isocratic flow at 0% for  <dig> min, linear gradient from  <dig> to 50%b in  <dig>  min,  <dig> to 99% until  <dig>  min, isocratic until  <dig>  min. the column was re-equilibrated for a further  <dig> min including subsequent injection cycle time. the autosampler was a shimadzu sil-htc. the column, a phenomenex gemini c <dig>   <dig> ×  <dig> mm was held at 50°c in a shimadzu oven, model cto-10avp. the ms detector was a  <dig> qtrap from applied biosytems. specific analyses were monitored in a targeted multi-reaction monitoring  mode in which all specific source and collision cell parameters had been optimized. generic parameters were: ion source voltage  <dig> v, source temperature 450°c, the curtain, collision activated dissociation gas , nebulizer gas  and heater gas  set at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> psi respectively. the quadrupoles were set at unit resolution and specific precursor-product ion pair parameters were determined automatically using the quantitative optimization facility of analyst  <dig> . <dig>  subsequent ion trap scans  were triggered by ion counts in any one mrm channel rising above  <dig> counts per scan . during these epi scans, the declustering potential was ramped from  <dig> to  <dig> v and the collision energy was ramped between  <dig> and  <dig> v. product ions were monitored in the range  <dig> to  <dig>  with a default fill time of  <dig> msec using dynamic fill time and a scan rate of 1000th/sec. relative quantification was performed by peak integration of the extracted ion chromatogram of the relevant mrm ion channel. the lc/ms system was controlled by the analyst  <dig> . <dig> software and data analysis was performed using the same in quantitative mode. a wide selection of synthetic ahls with or without a 3-oxo or 3-hydroxy substitution and with acyl side-chain lengths ranging from c <dig> to c <dig> each at either  <dig> μm or  <dig> μm concentrations, for ahls with even and odd carbon chain lengths respectively, were used as standards. ahls were identified and confirmed by comparing both the elution time and the ms spectra of the peaks obtained with those of the standards.

antifungal activity in vitro
the antagonistic activity of g <dig> and its derivatives g3/pme6863-aiia and g3/pme <dig> were tested against the phytopathogenic fungus cryphonectria parasitica, the causal agent of chestnut blight as previously described  <cit> .

motility assays
minimal swim motility agar plates contained  <dig> g/liter tryptone,  <dig> g/liter nacl and  <dig> %  bacto agar  <cit> . a  <dig> μl volume of overnight seed cultures grown at 28°c were inoculated onto swim agar plates and incubated at 28°c for  <dig> h.

adhesion assays
adhesion is considered to be the first step in the development of bacterial biofilm. bacterial adhesion on abiotic surface was measured using polystyrene microtitre plates in triplicate as described by o'toole and kolter,  <dig>  <cit>  with a few modifications. overnight bacterial cultures were inoculated into the wells of microtiter plates in  <dig> μl of lb or m <dig> medium  without shaking and incubated at 30°c for  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> h, respectively. at  <dig> h intervals, the cell densities were determined at  <dig> nm, followed by quantification of adhesion. the medium was removed, and the cells were stained with  <dig> % solution of crystal violet  at room temperature for  <dig> min. the dye was then removed and the wells were washed four times. bound dye cv was solubilized with 95% ethanol, and the absorbance was measured at  <dig> nm.

flow cell biofilm assays
firstly the strains g3/pme6863-aiia and the vector control g3/pme <dig> were tagged with the green fluorescent protein, gfp by electroporation with plasmid pucp18::gfpmut <dig>   <cit> . the transconjugants were selected on lb plates supplemented with both tetracycline and carbenicillin, and verified through observation under the fluorescence microscope. biofilms were cultivated in a modified flow chamber in × <dig> diluted lb.  <dig> μl of bacterial overnight cultures  were injected into each channel of flow cell and incubated at room temperature for  <dig> hours, at flow rate of  <dig>  μl/ml for each channel.

capturing of confocal images
biofilms were visualized with an inverted zeiss lsm <dig> microscope. the objective used was a zeiss ec plan-neofluar 10x/ <dig> .  <dig> replicate z-stacks, with an interval of  <dig>  μm and the pinhole at 1au, were acquired from each flow cell and used to create three-dimensional representations of the biofilms. biofilm structure was quantified from the z stacks using the image analysis software package comstat  <cit> .

production of exoenzymes, siderophores and indole-3-acetic acid 
proteolytic and chitinolytic activities and siderophores production were assayed as described previously  <cit> . hplc  analysis of iaa production was performed as previously described  <cit> .

statistical analysis
all data were subjected to analysis of variance  using fisher's least significant difference  and duncan's multiple-range test to compare treatment mean values. each trial was repeated at least twice with at least three replicates for each treatment.

nucleotide sequence accession numbers
the genbank accession numbers for the splir, and spsri genes from strain g <dig> are fj <dig> and fj <dig>  respectively.

RESULTS
phylogenetic classification of s. plymuthica g3
to classify phylogenetically the g <dig> strain isolated from wheat stems, the sequence from the 1474-bp fragment of 16s rdna from this isolate we previously determined   <cit>  was subjected to phylogenetic analysis with different 16s rdna sequences from members of the genus serratia and e. coli strain atcc  <dig> as the outgroup. the sequence alignment for the phylogenetic tree was constructed and evaluated with mega  <dig> using the neighbour-joining method . as the phylogenetic tree showed that the g <dig> isolate was clustered within the same group  with rvh <dig>  and the type strain dsm  <dig>  of s. plymuthica, respectively. therefore, serratia sp. g <dig> was tentatively classified as s. plymuthica. it is worth noting that the atypical s. plymuthica rvh <dig> strain is unable to produce prodigiosin pigment when compared to the s. plymuthica dsm  <dig> type strain, but a combined comparative analysis of 16s rrna and gyrb sequences, dna-dna hybridization, and biochemical characteristics unequivocally identified this strain as s. plymuthica  <cit> .

s. plymuthica g <dig> possesses two quorum sensing systems splir and spsri
the homologues of the two luxir genes were cloned from strain g <dig> by pcr using primers against conserved sequences as described in the material and methods. pcr products of 1441-bp and 1391-bp corresponding to the expected splir and spsir respectively were sequenced. the 1441-bp resulting sequence included two open reading frames  corresponding to the predicted ahl synthase gene spli  and the response regulator gene splr  . the spli and splr orfs are convergent, overlapping by 29-bp in their 3' regions. the 1391-bp sequenced fragment carried two orfs corresponding to the predicted ahl synthase gene spsi  and the response regulator gene   . the spsr and spsi orfs are also convergent and overlapping by 54-bp in their 3' regions.

database searches using tblastx revealed that spli  shares 99% and 98% identity to spli  from s. plymuthica strains rvh <dig> and hro-c <dig>  respectively, as well as  <dig>   <dig>  67% identity to the spri  from serratia proteamaculans b5a, spni  from s. marcescens ss- <dig>  and esai  from pantoea stewartii dc <dig> respectively, which are mainly responsible for the synthesis of 3-oxo-c6-hsl  <cit> . the second luxi homolog spsi from g <dig> was most similar to the luxi homolog  from the poplar endophytic bacterium s. proteamaculans  <dig> , then to swri  from serratia marcescens mg <dig>  and to smai  from s. marcescens strain  <dig> , smai  from serratia strain atcc  <dig> . the ahl synthases swri and smai catalyze preferentially the synthesis of c4-hsl and, in less amount, c6-hsl  <cit> . to examine the evolutionary relationship between the luxi family members described above, a phylogenetic analysis was performed using mega  <dig> and the neighbour-joining tree was showed in figure  <dig>  the results were consistent with the similarity analysis of amino acid sequences within luxi family members, the luxi family synthases were clustered into two groups, and spli and spsi from strain g <dig> are classified into group a and group b, respectively.

spli and spsi from s. plymuthica g <dig> produce multiple ahls
to determine which ahls were made by each spli and spsi, lc-ms/ms analysis was performed on extracted culture supernatants from the wild type g <dig> strain as well as recombinant e. coli strains expressing spli or spsi and the spectra profiles compared to that of synthetic ahl standards. at least ten different ahls were detected in varying abundance in the wild type g <dig>  including unsubstituted ahls , 3-oxo derivatives  and 3-hydroxy derivatives . the most abundant and hence most likely biologically relevant ahls detected in the spent culture supernatants of the endophytic strain g <dig> were 3-oxo-c6-hsl, c4-hsl, c6-hsl, 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl and 3-oxo-c7-hsl. however, strain g <dig> did not produce long chain ahls  <cit> . when expressed in e. coli , the recombinant spli produced all ten ahls whereas spsi produced only unsubstituted ahls, including c4-hsl, c5-hsl, c6-hsl, c7-hsl, and c8-hsl. the most abundant one was c4-hsl from spsi,  <dig> fold higher than that the production of this molecule by spli in e. coli, suggesting that spsi is could also be the main ahl synthase responsible for synthesis of this ahl in g <dig>  in accordance with swri and smai from different s. marcescens strains  <cit>  which share similarity to spsi. both spsi and spli produce c6-hsl, but only spli was responsible for the most abundant signal 3-oxo-c6-hsl, that is similar to spli from s. plymuthica strains hro-c <dig> and rvh <dig>  <cit> , spri from s. proteamaculans b5a, spni from s. marcescens ss- <dig>  <cit> , as well as esai from p. stewartii  <cit> . however, 3-oxo-c7-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl have not been reported as the main ahl signals in other members of serratia with the exception of s. plymuthica ic <dig> which showed very weak production of the predicted 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl by tlc analysis  <cit> . it is worth noting that there might be differences between ahl ratios from spli and spsi expressed in the wild type g <dig> and e. coli.

ahl profiles identification was performed by lc-ms/ms from two independent experiments.

heterologous expression of aiia in g <dig> abolishes ahl accumulation and has an impact on biocontrol traits
a number of bacteria are known to regulate various cell processes, including biocontrol activities through ahl-mediated quorum sensing systems. to determine the ability of the bacillus a <dig> lactonase aiia in degrading ahl signal molecules in g <dig>  the plasmid pme6863-aiia, and the control vector pme <dig>  were introduced into the wild type g <dig> by mating with the e. coli donor strain s17- <dig>  overnight culture supernatants from these transconjugants were extracted in duplicate with solvent and subjected to lc-ms/ms semiquantitative analysis based on mrm mode showing that g <dig> harbouring the pme <dig> vector control exhibited similar ahl patterns and concentration to the wild type . in contrast, ahl production was practically abolished in g <dig> expressing aiia from pme6863-aiia , with only trace amounts of c4-hsl remaining which could not be detected by the biosensor cv <dig> and hence were unlikely to influence gene expression. this result suggested that aiia can efficiently degrade all series of ahls, including unsubstituted, 3-oxo, and 3-hydroxy at the third carbon position as it has been previously shown  <cit> .

impairment in ahl accumulation resulted in down-regulation of the chitinolytic and proteolytic activities in g3/pme6863-aiia. in contrast, biosynthesis of iaa increased five-fold and there was no effect on production of siderophores, compared to the wild type g <dig> and the control g3/pme <dig> . this is in agreement with previous observations in s. plymuthica hro-c <dig> heterologously expressing aiia  <cit> .

swimming motility was also assayed to determine the role of quorum quenching by aiia in motility. the swimming zones of the wild type g <dig>  the ahl quenched strain g3/pme6863-aiia and the vector control g3/pme <dig> after incubation for  <dig> h at 28°c were  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm,  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, and  <dig>  ±  <dig>  mm, respectively. the results suggest that, in contrast to s. plymuthica hro-c <dig> where qs negatively regulates this phenotype  <cit> , heterologous expression of aiia in g <dig> has no influence on swimming motility .

lactonase expression in s. plymuthica g <dig> reduces antifungal activity in vitro
strain g <dig> exhibited inhibitory effects against several phytopathogenic fungal isolates in vitro and in vivo . to determine the effect of quorum quenching by lactonase on antifungal activity, dual cultures were carried out, on single pda plates, of the strain g <dig>  g3/pme6863-aiia or g3/pme <dig> with c. parasitica, the cause of chestnut blight. after incubation for  <dig> days at 25°c, the radius of the inhibition zones was measured. although no large differences were observed between the wild type g <dig> and the control strain g3/pme <dig>  the radius of inhibition zones produced by g3/pme6863-aiia was significantly decreased compared with the control g3/pme <dig> and the wild type g <dig> at p =  <dig>  for c. parasitica . the data showed that antifungal activity by g <dig> is partially dependent on ahl signaling via regulation of various exoenzymes and secondary metabolites.

abiotic surface adhesion and biofilm formation in s. plymuthica g <dig> are affected by lactonase expression
many bacteria rely on qs systems to govern various aspects of biofilm development, including adhesion, motility, maturation, and dispersion  <cit> . using microtiter plate assays, we evaluated the impact of quorum quenching by aiia on adhesion to abiotic surfaces in g <dig>  figure 3a illustrates by od <dig>  there are no significant difference in bacterial growth rate between the wild type g <dig>  g3/pme <dig> and g3/pme6863-aiia, but the strain g3/pme6863-aiia showed a significant reduction in adhesion, compared with the vector control strain g3/pme <dig> and the wild type g <dig> .

furthermore,  <dig> hour flow cell cultures of gfp-tagged g3/pme6863-aiia and g3/pme <dig> were observed and quantified for biofilm formation using clsm during two independent experiments. figure 4a, b and 4c represent 2d optical slice and cross sections view  of bacterial biofilms developed after  <dig> h of growth by both strains. quantitative analysis by comstat indicated that not only the biofilm thickness , but also the biomass  between these two strains were significantly different, suggesting that biofilm development by g <dig>  under the conditions used, is ahl-dependent.

discussion
endophytic bacteria have been found in virtually every plant studied, and there is increasing interest in developing their biotechnological potential to improve phytoremediation and the sustainable production of non-food crops for biomass and biofuel production  <cit> . in this manuscript we have reported that a new isolate of endophytic serratia plymuthica g <dig> from the stems of wheat, exhibiting antifungal activities, produces high levels of ahls and that the qs control of swimming motility and biofilm formation shows significant differences to other isolates of this organism from different environments previously described.

the ability of serratia strains to produce ahls and their ahl production profiles is well known to be species- and strain-dependent  <cit> . previous works have also demonstrated that in s. marcescens ss- <dig> and s. plymuthica strains rvh <dig> and hro-c <dig>  spni or spli knock out mutations abolished the production of 3-oxo-c6-hsl completely, but still retained residual ahl signals, suggesting the presence of additional ahl synthase in some species of serratia  <cit> . however, this is the first report showing the identification and initial characterisation of two qs systems splir and spsir in a single serratia isolate. sequence analysis showed that splir is highly similar to the splir of s. plymuthica strains rvh <dig> and hro-c <dig>  as well as sprir of s. proteamaculans b5a and s. marcescens ss- <dig>  all of which are responsible for the biosynthesis of 3-oxo-c6-hsl, and c6-hsl. whereas spsir shares similarity to swrir and smair from s. marcescens mg <dig> and strain  <dig> respectively, which are responsible for production of unsubstituted c4-hsl and smaller amounts of unsubstituted c6-hsl and c8-hsl . in addition, these two sets of luxi and luxr homologous genes organized convergently in s. plymuthica g <dig> chromosome is characteristic of the most γ-proteobacteria  <cit> . the results were in line with the phylogenetic analysis , demonstrating that the luxi family members from the genus of serratia can be clustered into groups a and b according to the main ahl signals produced by bacteria, but it is not species-specific. for example, s. marcescens ss- <dig> was classified into group a as spli of g <dig>  known to produce 3-oxo-c6-hsl. in contrast, strain  <dig> and mg <dig> of s. marcescens were clustered into group b due to the production of c4-hsl as was spsi from g <dig>  hence, our data provide new evidence to support that ahl patterns in serratia is strain-dependent, indicating the presence of some conserved protein structure-function characteristics that would determine this specificity and which would be worth investigating in future. in addition, horizontal transfer of qs systems due to transposition or phage-mediated events have been described for the spnir locus of s. marcescens ss- <dig> and the smair locus from strain  <dig> to  <dig>  <cit> . consequently, the presence of two qs systems in g <dig> may have originated from horizontal gene transfer amongst members of the genus serratia. gray and garey  also deduced that multiple luxi and/or luxr homologues present within single species have been usually acquired from independent sources  <cit> .

further comparative analysis of ahl profiles using lc-ms/ms from the wild type g <dig> and e. coli dh5α expressing the recombinant plasmid carrying and spli or spsi showed that spli is responsible for the synthesis of a broad range of ahls with different substitutions whereas spsi only drives the synthesis of ahls with no substitutions on their acyl chains all of which are also made by spli although some of them at much lower levels such as c4-hsl and c5-hsl. to our knowledge, the strain g <dig> is the only serratia so far described with the ability to produce  <dig> different families of ahls according to substitutions in position  <dig> , although this can be due to the improved lc-ms/ms techniques used with higher sensitivity to detect lower concentration and broader range of ahl signals. the most abundant ahl signals identified by lc-ms/ms from g <dig> were 3-oxo-c6-hsl and c4-hsl although significant levels of c6-hsl, 3-oxo-c7-hsl and 3-hydroxy-c6-hsl were also detected  <cit> . however, the individual biological role of these ahls remains unknown. overlaps between the ahl profiles produced by different luxi homologues in a single organism has been previously described in other bacteria such as yersinia pseudotuberculosis  <cit>  and this usually results in very complex qs regulatory cascades with a tight intraregulation between them  <cit> . whether this level of complexity exists in the g <dig> strain remains to be elucidated.

in many plant beneficial rhizobacteria, qs mechanisms induce the synthesis of antimicrobial secondary metabolites and extracellular lytic enzymes with inhibitory effects towards other bacteria, fungi, protozoa, and nematodes  <cit> . the quorum quenching strategy using the lactonase aiia was exploited to simultaneously quench the two ahl systems discovered in the endophytic strain g <dig> of s. plymuthica and investigate their role in controlling biocontrol-related phenotypes. the phenotypic analysis revealed that the strain g3/pme <dig> expressing aiia had reduced antifungal activity, chitinolytic and proteolytic activities, but increased of iaa biosynthesis, and had no impact on siderophore production compared with the strain carrying the vector control g3/pme <dig> and the wild type g <dig>  indicating that qs control multiple biocontrol-related phenotypes in this strain. these results are in agreement with previous observations in the rhizospheric s. plymuthica hro-c <dig> expressing ahl lactonases  <cit> . depletion of ahls with this lactonase resulted in altered adhesion and biofilm formation in vitro. this was different from the closely related s. plymuthica strains hro-c <dig> and rvh <dig>  where biofilm formation for both strains is ahl-independent. in addition, in contrast to hro-c <dig>  swimming motility was not controlled by ahl-mediated qs  <cit> .

attachment is required for biofilm formation and these are key processes in the interaction between bacteria and plant tissues which have been shown to rely on quorum sensing  <cit> . for example, in the biocontrol bacterium pseudomonas chlororaphis strain 30- <dig>  qs systems and their control over phenazine production play a role in the successful formation of surface-attached populations required for biofilm formation. transcriptome analysis revealed that phenazines as signals, up-regulated many of the genes related to cell adhesion and biofilm development, such as fimbrial and lipopolysaccharides  genes  <cit> . the swrir quorum sensing system in s. marcescens mg <dig> plays a key role in biofilm development, from attachment to swarming motility, biofilm maturation and detachment, although qs regulation of adhesion in mg <dig> is surface dependent  <cit> . in s. marcescens strain  <dig>  biofilm formation seems to rely on smai, although this was measured using an attachment assay to a plastic microtitre plate  <cit> , where smai is mainly responsible for c4-hsl synthesis. pantoea stewartii causing stewart's vascular wilt and leaf blight in sweet corn and maize utilizes the esai/esar qs system to control virulence and effective colonization. esai shares 80% similarity to spli of g <dig> and is a typical ahl synthase that also catalyzes preferentially the synthesis of 3-oxo-c6-hsl. both esai and esar mutants were not able to cycle through normal programmed bacterial development leading to the formation of atypical biofilms in vitro and loss of dissemination and infectivity in vivo, although the ahl-deficient strain displayed an unusually robust adhesion phenotype  <cit> . under the experimental conditions used the ability of abiotic surface adhesion and biofilm formation by g <dig>  using microtiter plate and flow cell assays respectively, is ahl-dependent, as the strain g3/pme <dig> expressed aiia was impaired in these phenotypes in vitro. in contrast, previous studies based on microtitre plate assays reported that biofilm formation by the closely related s. plymuthica strains hro-c <dig> and rvh <dig> were not affected by ahl signalling. this was demonstrated by the heterologous expression aiia or the use of a spli-mutant in which 3-oxo-c6-hsl production was abolished, but still retained residual unsubstituted ahls  <cit> . this suggests that qs may have different roles in s. plymuthica isolates from different environments.

a number of different factors might affect adhesion, including physicochemical interactions between the bacterium and the substratum, flagella, fimbriae, outer membrane proteins, and the presence of extracellular polymers. for instance, quorum-sensing regulation of adhesion, biofilm formation, and sloughing in s. marcescens mg <dig> has been shown to be surface dependent, and under the control of nutrient cues  <cit> . we predict that the variations on qs regulation of biofilm development among different strains of s. plymuthica is likely to be influenced by strain-specificity or their life style though this remains to be further investigated.

consequently, this study reveals that, in s. plymuthica g <dig>  qs positively controls antifungal activity, production of exoenzymes, but negatively regulated production of indol-3-acetic acid . this is in agreement with previous reports in strain hro-c <dig>  however, in contrast to s. plymuthica strains hro-c <dig> and rvh <dig>  where biofilm formation is ahl-independent, in g <dig> adhesion and biofilm formation is controlled by qs. finally, in contrast to hro-c <dig>  swimming motility is not under qs control in g <dig>  <cit> . this work indicates the existence of a differential role for qs between endophytic and free living bacterial isolates suggesting that this regulatory mechanism can evolve to maximise the adaptation to different lifestyles.

CONCLUSIONS
two qs systems splir and spsir from the endophytic s. plymuthica strain g <dig> have been characterised and their ahl profiles determined. this qs network is involved in global regulation of biocontrol-related traits, especially antifungal activity, adhesion and biofilm formation some of which are strain-specific in the genus of serratia. further investigation will focus on the interplay between the two qs systems in strain g <dig> and the integration of qs into complex regulatory networks to modulate the beneficial plant-microbe interaction. this will ultimately lead to the optimisation of seed inoculums and provide novel strategies to improve the efficacy of s. plymuthica-mediated biocontrol and plant growth promotion.
