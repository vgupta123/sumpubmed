BACKGROUND
burkholderia cepacia lipase  formerly known as pseudomonas cepacia lipase has been shown to be a useful enzyme which catalyzes a broad range of different reactions in water and non-polar solvents under mild conditions. bcl is a highly selective catalyst for a broad range of substrates  <cit> , including the kinetic resolution of racemic mixtures of secondary alcohols by hydrolysis in water or esterification in organic solvents  <cit> . all lipases have a similar architecture, the α/β hydrolase fold  <cit> , which consists of parallel β-strands flanked by α-helices, and an active site with a catalytic triad consisting of ser, his, and asp/glu  <cit> . the characteristic of most lipases is their activation upon binding to a hydrophobic interface  <cit> . most lipases consist of a mobile element at the surface, a lid, which covers the active site  <cit> . the lid is opening at a hydrophobic interface, making the active site accessible for substrates and enhancing the activity of the lipase  <cit> . because the exterior of the lid is hydrophilic and its interior is hydrophobic, the hydrophobic surface of lipases increases upon lid opening  <cit> . therefore, in non-polar solvents the open conformation was expected to be thermodynamically favored  <cit> .

the crystal structure of bcl has been determined without a bound inhibitor in an open conformation of the lid. the lid consists of a helix-loop-helix motif with helix α <dig>  and helix α <dig>  which are linked to helix α <dig>   <cit> . bcl contains an essential ca2+-ion site  <cit>  which stabilizes a β-hairpin   <cit> . while no experimental structure of bcl in the closed conformation is available, a homologous lipase from burkholderia glumae    <cit>  with a sequence identity of 84% has been crystallized in the closed conformation. the cores of both homologous lipases have an identical structure with a root-mean squared deviation  of backbone atoms of  <dig>  Å, while the main structural difference between the two conformations is the position of the lid  with a rmsd of  <dig> Å. the length of helix α <dig> in bcl  was identified to be longer compared to bgl , and the length of helix α <dig> in bcl  was shorter in bgl . thus, the x-ray structures of open bcl and closed bgl suggests that the interfacial activation of bcl involves a motion of helices α <dig> and α <dig>  <cit>  and a partial unfolding of helix α <dig> in bgl. however, the mechanism of lid opening is still discussed. several mechanisms of interfacial activation of lipases have been supposed. the substrate theory suggests that the lid opening is induced by binding of a substrate  <cit> , while the enzyme theory suggests that the lid opens by adsorption to a hydrophobic interface  <cit> . despite the fact that structures of the closed  <cit>  and the open conformation  <cit>  of several lipases are known, a complete description of the mechanism of lid opening and closing is still lacking. the identification of mobile elements was possible by the availability of open and closed structures, but attempts to obtain any intermediates between the closed and open conformation  <cit>  and conformational transitions have not been successful in experiment. therefore, short molecular dynamics simulations of different lipases have been reported to get more insight into the conformational transition of the lid  <cit> . however, the time-scale of conformational transition of the lid from the closed to the fully open conformation was not reached in short molecular dynamics simulations. therefore, methods like essential dynamics  <cit> , normal mode analysis  <cit> , and brownian dynamics simulations  <cit>  were used to study the lid opening in non-polar solvents.

to investigate the solvent-dependent motions of the mobile lid  and the β-hairpin  of bcl, multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the open crystal structure and the closed homology model of bcl were performed in water and toluene without using restraints or external forces. toluene was used as a typical non-polar solvent which is widely used in lipase-catalyzed conversions. it has been shown that bcl is stable in toluene without significant loss of activity. the details of the conformational pathway were examined, to distinguish whether the transition occurs via a rigid-body movement or via a partial or complete unfolding, and bottlenecks in the lid opening and closing were identified.

RESULTS
three simulations of 15– <dig> ns with different starting velocity distributions were performed for four enzyme-solvent systems, the closed homology model and the open crystal structure of bcl in water and toluene. the observed conformational transitions of the lid were dependent on the solvent, while all three simulations of the same enzyme-solvent system showed essentially the same transition. in eleven simulations, the ca2+-binding site was stable, while in one simulation of closed bcl in water the ca2+-ion left the binding pocket after  <dig> ns of simulation time.

analysis of crystal structure and homology model
all available crystal structures of bcl have been obtained in their open conformation  <cit>  showing only small root mean squared deviations  of backbone atoms in the range of  <dig> – <dig>  Å. in all crystal structures there are crystal contacts between helix α <dig>  and helix α <dig>  of a second monomer, as well as between residues 217– <dig> and 223– <dig> of the β-hairpin and residues 130– <dig> of helix α <dig> of the lid of a second monomer . the crystal contacts are stabilized by electrostatic interactions between the negative potential of the lid and the positive potential of the β-hairpin . in addition, hydrophobic contacts were observed between helix α <dig> and its equivalent of a second monomer at residues  <dig> to  <dig>  in contrast, there are no crystal contacts between the lid and the β-hairpin in the crystal structure in the closed conformation of the homologous burkholderia glumae lipase    <cit> , which was used as template for the homology model of closed bcl. the sequences of bcl and bgl are highly similar with a sequence identity of 84%. in the lid, only residues  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> are different.

the homology model of closed bcl showed no significant differences to the core of the open crystal structure, but was different in the conformation of the lid. the major movement was expected for helix α <dig> and the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig>  while helix α <dig> slightly changed its orientation. helix α <dig> of bcl increased in length in the open conformation  as compared to the closed conformation , while helix α <dig> decreased in length in the open conformation  as compared to the closed conformation  of bcl , as already been observed in the closed conformation of bgl. furthermore, small differences can be observed in the position of the β-hairpin and in other loops . the quality of the closed homology model of bcl was analyzed by prosa showing a z-score of - <dig>  and a local model quality similar to the template bgl with a z-score of - <dig> . in contrast, the z-scores of both closed structures were slightly better as compared to the open crystal structure of bcl showing a z-score of - <dig>  and a local model quality with high energy at helix α <dig> of the lid.

the conformation of the lid was characterized by two distances: the movement of the whole lid was described by the distance between atom cα of residue  <dig> in helix α <dig> to atom cα of residue  <dig> in helix α <dig>  which was  <dig>  Å in the closed homology model and  <dig>  Å in the open crystal structure. the movement of the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig> was described by the distance of atom cα of residue  <dig> from the closed to the open conformation, which was  <dig>  Å between the homology model and the crystal structure.

simulation of closed bcl in water
in all three simulations of closed bcl in water no significant conformational change was observed. the backbone rmsd of the conformation after  <dig> ns to the initial structure was  <dig>  Å of the core and  <dig>  Å of the lid. the core was stable, deviations were mainly observed at surface loops, especially at the β-hairpin  and the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig> of the lid . the lid was slightly closing as indicated by the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> which decreased from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å and the movement of the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig> of the lid by a distance of  <dig>  Å between atom cα of residue  <dig> from the simulated to the initial structure. the position of helix α <dig>  was unchanged, helix α <dig>  showed a movement by  <dig>  Å at its c-cap, near the loop between helices α <dig> and α <dig> 

the calculated b-factors per residue identified helix α <dig>  the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig>  the β-hairpin, helix α <dig> , helix α <dig>  and five further surface loops  as the most flexible regions . while the lid showed only a small movement, the flexible hydrophobic β-hairpin moved away from the lid by up to  <dig>  Å , measured by the distance of atom cα  <dig> to its initial structure. thus, the movement of the β-hairpin was independent of the movement of the lid.

simulation of open bcl in toluene
in all three simulations of open bcl in toluene, the core was stable, while the lid opened slightly more , as compared to the crystal structure. the backbone rmsd of the conformation after  <dig> ns to the initial structure was  <dig>  Å of the core and  <dig>  Å of the lid. the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> increased by  <dig> Å from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å, indicating a further lid opening. the distance of atom cα of residue  <dig> in the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig> from the initial structure to the simulated structure was  <dig>  Å, indicating a major movement of the loop. in contrast to the simulations of the closed structure in water, the flexible β-hairpin did not shift. during the further lid opening, the hydrophobic surface increased by  <dig> Å <dig> as compared to the crystal structure. the regions with highest flexibility as indicated by the calculated b-factors per residue were the lid, the β-hairpin, and further surface loops  .

simulation of closed bcl in toluene
in all three simulations of closed bcl in toluene, the lid gradually opened , while the core of the protein was stable. the backbone rmsd of the conformation after  <dig> ns to the initial structure was  <dig>  Å of the core and  <dig>  Å of the lid. the rmsd to the initial structure continuously increased during the first  <dig> ns of simulation  by a fast opening of the lid , while the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> increased by  <dig> Å. between  <dig> and  <dig> ns the lid slightly opened further by a distance cα 138-cα  <dig> of  <dig> Å, approaching its position in the nearly open conformation of the crystal structure until reaching a barrier . after gradually opening, the movement of the lid was blocked by helix α <dig> at a distance cα 138-cα  <dig> of  <dig>  Å, near to its position in the crystal structure with a distance cα 138-cα  <dig> of  <dig>  Å. the movement of helix α <dig> was blocked by the n-cap of helix α <dig>   and it was not possible to overcome this barrier until the end of simulations. while in the simulation residues  <dig> to  <dig> were helical as in the homology model of the closed structure, helix α <dig>  in the crystal structure of the open conformation was partially unfolded near its n-cap, leaving residues  <dig> to  <dig> in a loop structure , which would allow the further movement of helix α <dig> 

in all simulations in toluene, a salt bridge was formed between asp <dig> at the n-cap of helix α <dig> and arg <dig>  which was not observed in the crystal structures of bcl and the homology model derived from bgl. this salt bridge prevented helix α <dig> from a movement in toluene. the opening of the lid was a hinge-type motion of a single helix α <dig> and the concomitant stretching of the flexible loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig>  during the conformational transition the secondary structure of helix α <dig> was conserved. thus, the lid opening involved conformational rearrangements of several secondary structure elements: a rigid body movement of helix α <dig> and a movement of the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig>  while helix α <dig> showed no significant movement . the solvent accessible surface area  of the open crystal structure  was  <dig> Å <dig> larger than the sasa of the closed conformation of the homology model . during lid opening, the sasa increased by  <dig> Å <dig> to  <dig> Å <dig>  while the hydrophilic sasa decreased by  <dig> Å <dig>  the hydrophobic sasa increased by  <dig> Å <dig> exposing a large hydrophobic patch of the lid to the non-polar solvent . the increase in hydrophobic sasa mainly occurred during the first  <dig> ns in correlation with lid opening . while in the closed structure this hydrophobic patch was shielded from the solvent, making the protein surface more hydrophilic , in the open conformation the hydrophobic interior of the lid was exposed to the solvent.

the β-hairpin was very flexible, but showed no directed movement in contrast to the simulations in water.

simulation of open bcl in water
in the three simulations of open bcl in water, a partial lid closing was observed, while the core of the protein was stable. the backbone rmsd of the conformation after  <dig> ns to the initial structure of open bcl was  <dig>  Å of the core and  <dig>  Å of the lid. the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> decreased by  <dig>  Å, from  <dig>  Å to  <dig>  Å. the distance of atom cα of residue  <dig> in the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig> to its position in the open crystal structure increased to  <dig>  Å. however, the fully closed conformation was not reached. predominantly helix α <dig> was moving, while helices α <dig>  α <dig>  and α <dig> showed no movement. the movement of helix α <dig> was very slow and was not blocked by other structural elements. in contrast to the opening in toluene, helix α <dig> partially unfolded at its n-cap  and changed from a straight to a more curved structure. as in the simulations of closed bcl in water, the β-hairpin showed a movement away from the lid by up to  <dig>  Å .

to investigate whether the solvent is the only driving force for the observed conformational transition, eight simulations in water were performed starting with intermediate structures taken from the simulation of the lid opening in toluene. conformers were taken at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>   <dig>  and  <dig> ns and simulated for  <dig> ns after changing the solvent from toluene to water . in all simulations, the lid was partially closing and the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> changed between  <dig>  to  <dig>  Å , indicating that the conformational transition can be reversed by changing the solvent. in one simulation, using the conformer after  <dig> ns as starting structure, the lid closed completely after  <dig> ns. there was no blocking of the lid by other structural elements in the simulations. it is quite remarkable, that for all simulations in water four preferred distances cα 138-cα  <dig> were identified at  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  Å .

the lid opening of bcl was reversed in simulations of  <dig> ns after changing the solvent from toluene to water, measured by distance cα 138-cα  <dig>  the used starting conformations were selected from simulation of closed bcl in toluene after different times. the distance cα 138-cα  <dig> in the closed homology model was  <dig>  Å.

coordination of asp130
in the crystal structures of bcl and bgl, the carboxylic group of the side chain of asp <dig>  located in the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig>  is coordinated by hydrogen bonds between the backbone and the side chain of thr <dig>  and the backbone of ser <dig>  stabilizing the conformation of the loop. during the simulations of open and closed bcl in water, the side chain of asp <dig> was also coordinated by the backbone and the side chain of thr <dig>  and the backbone of ser <dig>  but these hydrogen bonds were partially lost during the simulation and replaced by hydrogen bonds to water molecules of the solvent. however, during simulations of closed bcl in toluene, asp <dig> formed additional hydrogen bonds during lid opening and became fourfold coordinated by the backbones and side chains of thr <dig> and ser <dig>  furthermore, in the simulations of open bcl in toluene, asp <dig> was sixfold coordinated forming two additional hydrogen bonds to backbone and side chain of thr <dig> . thus, in toluene the loop between helix α <dig> and α <dig> was stabilized in the open conformation by the coordination of asp <dig> in an extended hydrogen bonding to other amino acids of the loop.

discussion
the interfacial activation of lipases is associated with a conformational change of the lid  <cit> . the detailed analysis of the pathway of the conformational transition is not accessible in experiment. to get insight into the interfacial activation of bcl, multiple molecular dynamics simulations of the open and closed conformation of bcl in explicit solvent models of water and toluene were carried out without using restraints or external forces. an implicit organic solvent model was not used, because essential water molecules are supposed to be important to retain the flexibility of the lipase. reproducibility of the observed properties was confirmed by performing three simulations for each system. the primary purpose was to apply molecular dynamics simulations examine the motion and conformational transition of the lid  and the β-hairpin  of bcl, which is not yet accessible to an experimental investigation.

for each system, a similar behaviour was observed: a fast opening of the lid in toluene starting with the closed structure, a closing of the open structure in water, and no major conformational changes in the simulation of the closed and open structure in water and toluene, respectively. our major observations, the solvent-dependent opening and closing of the lid and the decoupling of the motions of lid and β-hairpin, were confirmed in an independent work in the group of p. monsan  on simulation of conformational transitions of bcl: while lid opening occured at a water-hexane interface, closing of the lid was observed in water .

simulation of closed bcl in water
in simulations of closed bcl in water, the lid stayed in its closed conformation. a slight further lid closing was observed which indicates that the homology model of closed bcl might not represent the closed conformation in solution. furthermore, the lid showed a high conformational mobility in the absence of an oil-water interface which is supported by experimental observations. high b-factors of the lid were observed in all lipases in closed conformation  <cit> , which led initially to the hypothesis that the lid of bgl can undergo a conformational transition. in crystallographic studies of closed thermomyces lanuginosa lipase  in water, the lid was disordered  <cit> , and in rhizopus delemar lipase two different conformations of the closed lid were observed  <cit> .

simulation of open bcl in toluene
in simulations of open bcl in toluene, the lid further opened. this was also observed in brownian dynamics simulations of rhizomucor miehei lipase   <cit> . at a lipid binding zone, which is comparable to a non-polar solvent, the lid further opened starting from the open crystal structure  <cit> . the further lid opening might be due to a different stabilization of the open structure in non-polar solvents as compared to the crystal structure. while in non-polar solvents, the lid is stabilized by an increase of hydrophobic surface, the conformation of the lid in the crystal is the result of energetic compromises to form stable contact interactions  <cit> . upon molecular dynamics simulations of monomers in solution, starting with crystal structures, the structure is released from its crystal contacts and relaxed to a conformation close to that in solution  <cit> . the overall flexibility in simulations of open bcl in toluene was about half the flexibility of closed bcl in water, which is in agreement with a general observation of a decreased flexibility of proteins in non-polar solvents in experiment  <cit>  and in molecular dynamics simulations  <cit> .

simulation of closed bcl in toluene
in our simulations of closed bcl in toluene, the lid opening by  <dig> Å was observed by a rigid-body movement of helix α <dig> without unfolding of helices α <dig> and α <dig>  a similar rigid-body hinge-type motion of a single helix was also concluded from the existence of a closed and open crystal structure of rml  <cit> . the lid opening of rml was observed in a low-dielectric medium, whereas in a high-dielectric medium no opening was observed  <cit> . in our simulations the hydrophobic surface of bcl increased upon lid opening, which is in agreement with a general observation of most lipases, where lid opening is associated with an increase in hydrophobic surface  <cit> .

previously, a partial opening of the lid has been investigated in simulations for different lipases. in molecular dynamics simulations in a continuum with different dielectric constants, lid opening was enhanced in a medium with a low dielectric constant, while the opening time of the lid increased for media with increasing dielectric constants  <cit> . in previous brownian dynamics simulations, the lid of rml opened during  <dig> ns in a low-dielectric medium, while in a high-dielectric medium the lid stayed in its closed conformation for  <dig> ns  <cit> . in a  <dig> ns molecular dynamics simulation of rml in explicit water, the lid was highly flexible and a lid opening was concluded from essential dynamics analysis  <cit> . the partial lid opening was also observed for rml  <cit> , humicola lanuginosa lipase   <cit> , and candida rugosa lipase   <cit>  in explicit solvents. in short molecular dynamics simulations of open bcl in water and vacuum, no conformational transition of the lid and a similar behaviour in different solvent environments was observed  <cit> . it was suggested that lid opening of hll is a multi-step process involving more than two conformational transitions before a fully activated conformation is assumed  <cit> . this is in agreement with our simulations of bcl, where a barrier was identified, blocking the movement of helix α <dig> by the n-cap of helix α <dig>  while the generated homology model of closed bcl and the template of closed bgl show a long helix α <dig> , helix α <dig> is shorter in the open structure of bcl , where asp <dig> is replaced by asn in the sequence of bcl. thus, the unfolding of the n-cap of helix α <dig>  would be necessary to make the complete movement of the lid towards the fully open structure feasible. however, this unfolding was not observed in the time scale in our simulations of  <dig> ns. the blocking of helix α <dig> by helix α <dig> seems to result from a different secondary structure of helix α <dig> in the open and closed structure.

a correlation of the lid movement with a surface loop was previously observed in restrained simulations of pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase, which was suggested to trigger the lid opening  <cit> . in all our simulations of closed and open bcl in water, the β-hairpin drifted away from the lid, while it did not move in toluene, independent of the conformation of the lid. the conformational transition of the lid of bcl was not coupled to the β-hairpin or other surface loops, which was also not observed for other lipases  <cit> .

different mechanisms of interfacial activation have been already proposed. while in the 'substrate theory', changes in the conformation of the lid are dependent on a bound substrate molecule  <cit> , in the 'enzyme theory' conformational changes on the enzyme are based on the adsorption to a lipid interface  <cit> . the lid opening in our simulations was only driven by the hydrophobicity of the solvent, where a hydrophobic solvent favored the opening of the lid, which supports the 'enzyme theory' and experimental observations. however, the solvent might not be the only reason leading to a complete opening of the lid, and we cannot exclude a possible influence of a substrate intermediate covalently bound to the catalytic serine. several lipases have been crystallized in an open conformation in the absence of a bound inhibitor  <cit> . the lid opening of human pancreatic lipase by water-miscible organic solvents without a bound substrate was also observed in experiment using antibodies  <cit> , and a hydrophobic patch led to a conformational transition to the open conformation of crl  <cit> .

simulation of open bcl in water
the open conformation of bcl in water showed a partial lid closing during the simulations. however, lid closing in water was much slower than lid opening in toluene, and a complete movement of the lid to the closed conformation of the homology model was not observed. for crl it was observed in experiment that the conversion between the open and closed conformation was very slow in aqueous solution in the absence of interfaces, which made the separation of the two conformations possible, while the exposure of crl to a hydrophobic patch accelerated the transition  <cit> . however, a transition state between the closed and the open conformation could not be isolated. short molecular dynamics simulations of the open conformation of bcl in water and vacuum demonstrated the high flexibility of the lid and the β-hairpin  <cit> . it was concluded from its high flexibility that the open structure of bcl becomes unstable in water leading to lid closing, however, a conformational transition from the open to the closed conformation was not observed.

the conformational transition of bcl from the closed to the open conformation of the lid in toluene could be reversed after changing the solvent from toluene to water. the analysis of eight simulations starting with intermediate positions of lid opening in toluene indicated that there are at least three local energy minima in addition to the closed crystal structure. in one simulation the lid closed completely, while in all other simulations a partially closing was observed. in contrast to the lid opening in non-polar solvents, the lid closing in water was a stepwise rather than a continuous process, associated with a partial unfolding and deformation of the helical structures in the lid.

coordination of asp130
the solvent was the driving force of the opening and closing of the lid. local unfolding by breaking hydrogen bonds was mediated by water molecules, while the formation of hydrogen bonds was driven by the non-polar solvent. the formation of a local hydrogen bond network was most prominent in the loop between helix α <dig> and helix α <dig>  which seems to direct the conformational transition. asp  <dig> plays a pivotal role in the hydrogen bond formation and stabilizes the open conformation of the lid in toluene. while asp <dig> was sixfold coordinated by backbone and side chain atoms after simulation in toluene, which was closely related to the movement of the loop, these hydrogen bonds were lost in water by coordination of water molecules of the solvent, leading to a destabilization of the open structure. a pivotal role of single amino acids directing the lid opening might not be restricted to bcl, as observed in previous simulations of tll, where a solvent-dependent switch of arg <dig> in the lid was observed  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the observed conformational transitions of the lid were dependent on the solvent. in simulations of closed bcl in water, no significant conformational change was observed, while in simulations of closed bcl in toluene the lid gradually opened. in simulations of open bcl in toluene, the lid opened slightly more than in the crystal structure, while in simulations of open bcl in water a partial closing of the lid was observed. in simulations of closed and open bcl in water, the hydrophobic β-hairpin moved away from the lid, while it showed no directed movement in simulations in toluene. thus, the movement of the β-hairpin was independent of the movement of the lid.
