BACKGROUND
intracellular protein secretion is an essential and complex process found in all eukaryotic organisms  <cit> . approximately one-third of all eukaryotic proteins undergo transport from the endoplasmic reticulum  to the er-golgi intermediate complex . this pathway is termed the anterograde early secretory pathway and is facilitated by the coat protein complex ii  proteins  <cit> . the copii secretory machinery is composed of five cytosolic proteins; sar <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  sec <dig>  and sec <dig>  which assemble in a processive and stepwise fashion . many protein types travel through this pathway including a large class of integral membrane proteins known as the voltage-gated potassium channels   <cit> . kv channels are molecular machines that are selective for and conduct potassium ions across cellular membranes in response to changes in membrane potential  <cit> . there are forty human kv channel family members that account for more than half of the seventy-eight potassium channel proteins identified in the human genome  <cit> .

the spatial and temporal distribution of kv channels is a critical determinant of cell excitability and therefore these proteins remain a concentrated target of pharmacological drug studies to alleviate neuroinflammatory and autoimmune diseases . moreover, recent investigations have identified their peripheral roles in the regulation of metabolism, body weight, and management of type ii diabetes . although, it has been found that kv channels contain numerous signaling domains, which are primarily located on the cytoplasmic n- and c-termini, the mechanism by which kv channels reach their functional locations have not been completely characterized . it has been shown that the n-terminus contains the t <dig> tetramerization domain, which promotes the formation of properly assembled channels  <cit> , while the c-terminus is recognized to harbor the er export motif that facilitates efficient processing and localization of kv channels to the plasma membrane .

several sequences have been shown to be associated with er export of potassium channels. in the kv <dig> family, a highly conserved c-terminal motif, hrete has been shown to contribute to channel trafficking of kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>   <cit>  . a different motif, vxxsl, where x represents any amino acid followed by ser then leu, was discovered in kv <dig>  . this sequence was reported to have a significant role in that protein’s intracellular trafficking . in kv <dig> , a non-canonical di-acidic er export motif was discovered at positions e483-e <dig>  <cit>  . this motif is located further downstream from the previously reported hrete motif  and was suggested to associate with sec24d to promote the anterograde trafficking of kv <dig>  channels within the secretory pathway. di-acidic exit motifs found in the c-termini of other potassium channels include vlsevdetd in the inward rectifier  kir <dig> subfamily, fcyene in kir <dig> , eleteeee and nqdmeigv in the kir <dig> a and kir <dig>  family members respectively, and ede in the two-pore potassium channel  task- <dig> proteins  <cit> . interestingly, these potassium channel families share little sequence homology in their c-termini, yet their er export mechanism show a dependence on a di-acidic motif for efficient passage through the anterograde early secretory pathway.

the copii cargo adaptor subunit sec <dig> has four human isoforms  where different isoforms are recognized to bind to or associate with unique anterograde trafficking motifs to mediate er export  <cit> . sec <dig> isoforms a and b have been shown to associate primarily with a di-acidic motif, d/exd/e, where d/e are acidic residues, while sec <dig> c and d recognize a series of hydrophobic residues . many of the er exit motifs in potassium channel families contain di-acidic motifs, and mutations in these regions have been shown to disrupt potassium channel cell surface localization  <cit> . a putative canonical di-acidic motif is present on the cytoplasmic c-terminus of mouse kv <dig>  between residues 443- <dig>  that is partially contained in and extends beyond the hrete sequence previously shown to contribute to the trafficking of kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>  . here, we show that this stretch of acidic residues has a modest yet measureable effect on the anterograde trafficking of kv <dig>  channels. furthermore, we show a disruption of kv <dig>  anterograde trafficking upon knockdown of sec24a and demonstrate that kv <dig>  is a bona fide client of this cargo adaptor isoform using an in vitro membrane flotation assay.

RESULTS
fluorescent tag of kv <dig>  channel does not perturb biophysical properties
although it has been previously examined in other expression systems, we confirmed that our n-terminal enhanced green fluorescent protein  insertion did not alter kv <dig>  channel function. kv <dig> -egfp biophysics were compared to wild type  kv <dig>  using patch-clamp electrophysiology. kv <dig> -egfp exhibited nearly identical biophysical characteristics as that of wtkv <dig> . addition of the n-terminal egfp did not significantly alter the magnitude of the peak or sustained current, the current-voltage relationship, the voltage at half activation , or the kinetics of inactivation or deactivation . overall, these results suggest that there are no deleterious alterations of the kv <dig>  channel properties when fused with the egfp reporter.

identifying the role of the kv <dig>  c-terminus in the anterograde early secretory pathway
we first set out to determine the role of the kv <dig> -egfp c-terminus in its anterograde early secretory trafficking mechanism. upon deletion of the c-terminus , hek  <dig> cells expressing the kv <dig> -egfp Δc channel showed a dramatic reduction in the outward current as compared to kv <dig> -egfp as studied by patch-clamp electrophysiology . to better understand the consequences of deleting the c-terminus of kv <dig> -egfp, we visualized the trafficking defect using confocal microscopy in bsc <dig> cells. kv <dig> -egfp Δc was highly retained in the er tubular network as seen by its co-localization with the membranous er resident protein sec61β . thus, the c-terminus of kv <dig>  was a major determinant in promoting the er export of kv <dig>  channels.fig.  <dig> biophysical properties of kv <dig>  channels following mutations of the acidic er export motif. a bar graph of the mean peak  or sustained  current  for various voltage-clamped kv <dig> -egfp or mutant channels as recorded in cell-attached patches using a single step depolarization of +40 mv  from a holding potential  of -80 mv. representative current traces comparing kv <dig> -egfp with that of kv <dig> -egfp ∆c . b same as in  but comparing inactivation  or deactivation  kinetics of kv <dig> -egfp. significantly different by one-way anova, bonferoni’s post-hoc test, * =  <dig> . c line graph of the normalized tail currents is fit with a boltzmann relation to calculate voltage at half-activation . significantly different v1/ <dig> by one-way anova, bonferoni’s post-hoc test, *** =  <dig> , * =  <dig>

c-terminal acidic motif exexe mutations moderately alter kv <dig>  channel subcellular distribution
the c-terminus of kv <dig>  contains the conserved sequence hretxe  as a tandem di-acidic motif , which we hypothesized could interact with sec <dig> to facilitate er export. moreover, the hrete motif had previously been shown in kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>  to contribute to trafficking of those proteins  <cit> . to examine the influence of the exexe acidic motif in kv <dig> , we screened these acidic residues for their involvement to promote surface localization by patch-clamp electrophysiology after mutation using site-directed mutagenesis. the assumption was made that the degree of surface localization or channel density was proportional to current magnitude. there were no significant changes in the mean peak or sustained current magnitude of kv <dig> -egfp e443a, or the kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a mutants. the kinetics of inactivation for the e443a and e443a-e445a-e447a mutant channels demonstrated a strong trend to decrease the inactivation rate but did not reach statistical significance. the rate constant for the deactivation of the e443a and e443a-e445a-e447a channels was significantly less than that of the kv <dig> -egfp channel . finally, there was a significant increase in the voltage dependence for both the e443a and e443a-e445a-e447a mutant channels. the voltage at half-activation shifted to the left   <dig> and 13 mv, respectively, representing a substantial change in movement of the channel at a more hyperpolarized state. while these changes in kinetics and voltage sensitivity would not be predicted to be involved in kv <dig>  trafficking, they represent changes in channel function attributed to manipulation of the acidic c-terminal motif where the kv <dig>  channel is driven to a more excitable state by reaching the activation threshold at more hyperpolarized potentials. it was not possible to explore these secondary biophysical changes for the kv <dig> -egfp ∆c construct due to lack of resolvable current.

to further understand the exexe acidic motif, we visualized the kv <dig> -egfp localization using confocal microscopy. single  and double point mutations  were found to be efficiently trafficked to the cell surface of bsc <dig> cells . kv <dig> -egfp e447a and the triple point mutant kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a, however, were moderately co-localized with the membranous er resident protein sec61β . line scans of each fluorescent channel further demonstrate the overlap of these two proteins . these results demonstrate a moderate dependence on the acidic stretch of residues exexe found within the c-terminus of kv <dig> .

kv <dig> -egfp er retention on a population level
although our patch-clamp results suggested that the surface density was unchanged between kv <dig> -egfp or mutant proteins, that measurement doesn’t account for the relative amounts of er retention. to better understand the role of the acidic motif of kv <dig>  in er trafficking, we compared the relative amounts of kv <dig>  in the er over the total kv <dig>  expression for the different kv <dig> -egfp mutants. the assays were conducted at 36 h post transfection across a population of hek  <dig> cells as previous studies have shown high expression levels at that time point in that expression system  <cit> . er retention of expressed kv <dig> -egfp or mutant proteins was quantified by isolating er microsomes from hek  <dig> cells then using sds-page followed by western blot densitometry analysis to determine the relative amounts of kv <dig> -egfp protein retained in the er microsomes. the er microsome isolation was verified by probing for the luminal er resident protein bip, the luminal golgi resident protein gcp <dig>  the nuclear and perinuclear heat shock protein of 90 kda , and the cytosolic protein glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase  . the relative amount of carryover from the gcp <dig>  hsp <dig>  and gapdh proteins is low compared to the amount of bip present in the final pellet indicating that our microsomes are representative of the contents of the er. er microsome isolations from cells expressing the kv <dig> -egfp proteins were also probed for bip  indicating that the er microsomes from the cells expressing kv <dig> -egfp or the respective mutant proteins remain intact through the isolation procedure. western blots probing for kv <dig> -egfp protein  were further subjected to computer-assisted densitometry where the amount of total protein found in homogenized hek  <dig> cells was compared to the amount of kv <dig> -egfp protein retained within the er microsome enriched fraction . the amount of kv <dig> -egfp protein remaining in the er was less  when compared to both the kv <dig> -egfp e445a and the kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a mutant . this demonstrated that more of the kv <dig> -egfp protein was exported from the er than the kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a mutant protein. pairwise statistical comparisons between kv <dig> -egfp and all other mutants determined that only the triple point mutant kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a had a statistically significant amount of protein retained in the er. the retention assay could not be used to determine the amount of kv <dig> -egfp Δc protein retained within the er because the epitope used to generate the kv <dig>  channel antibody, fsu  <dig>  was located on the c-terminus  <cit> . these results indicate that the acidic motif found within the c-terminus of kv <dig>  was not entirely dispensable, but was also not an exclusive requirement for kv <dig>  trafficking within the early anterograde secretory pathway.fig.  <dig> retention of kv <dig> -egfp in the er upon sequential mutation of the acidic motif. bar graph depicting the amount of kv <dig> -egfp or mutant proteins retained in the er. ratio of relative percent intensity is equal to the amount of protein retained in the er microsome fractions divided by the total amount of protein from whole cell homogenates. resulting values were plotted as the mean ± standard error of the mean of three replicates . the only statistically different mutant was the kv <dig> -egfp e443a-e445a-e447a by one-way anova, bonferoni correction applied for type- <dig> errors 



er retention of kv <dig> -egfp after sirna knockdown of sec24
in order to determine which sec <dig> cargo adaptor subunit isoform was associated with kv <dig>  within a copii vesicle, we used an rna interference  assay to specifically target each sec <dig> isoform. the knockdown of each sec <dig> isoform was established by probing silenced cos- <dig> cells via western blot using isoform specific antibodies . in the conditions used, all isoforms were knocked down. to better understand the kv <dig> -egfp trafficking patterns upon sec <dig> knockdown, we first co-transfected silenced cos- <dig> cells with cdnas encoding kv <dig> -egfp and the vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein  tagged with a cerulean reporter , the latter of which has been extensively characterized in the early secretory pathway . vsvg is a known client of sec24a and sec24b. kv <dig> -egfp trafficking also showed a dependence on the sec24a and sec24b isoforms as observed via confocal microscopy. there were no dramatic changes in the intracellular trafficking profiles upon sec24c, sec24d, and sec24cd knockdown . the intracellular trafficking profile of the vsvg-cerulean protein exhibited similar features as the kv <dig> -egfp trafficking profile as these proteins almost completely co-localized with each other in all experimental conditions. this observation is further demonstrated by their respective line scan profiles . to further explore the kv <dig> -egfp trafficking disruption caused by knockdown of sec <dig>  silenced cos- <dig> cells were co-transfected with cdnas encoding kv <dig> -egfp and the membranous er resident protein sec61β-mcherry cdnas . kv <dig> -egfp co-localized with sec61β in the sec24a, sec24b, sec24a-b, and sec24a-d, but not in the sec24c, sec24d, or sec24cd knock down conditions. the intracellular fluorescent trafficking profile for kv <dig> -egfp was similar to that of the kv <dig> -egfp ∆c mutant upon double knockdown of sec24a-b and also sec24a-d  showing a strong retention of kv <dig> -egfp within the endomembrane tubular network. line scans of each fluorescent channel further demonstrate the overlap of these two proteins . these results indicated that the early anterograde secretion of kv <dig> -egfp protein from the er relied upon the sec24a and sec24b isoforms.fig.  <dig> kv <dig> -egfp trafficking after sirna mediated knockdown of sec <dig>  kv <dig> -egfp trafficking was examined after the knockdown of sec <dig> isoforms  in the presences of the membranous er resident protein sec61β tagged with the mcherry fluorophore . cellular nuclei were stained with dapi. the wild-type  trafficking profile is similar to the trafficking profile of sec24c and sec24cd knockdown conditions. an altered trafficking profile is seen in sec24a, sec24b, sec24ab, and sec24abcd conditions. interestingly, there is also an altered trafficking profile in the sec24d condition, but the kv <dig> -egfp signal does not overlap well with the sec61β protein. line scans of each fluorescent channel are shown. the white arrow in the merged image represents the placement and direction of the line scan. scale bar = 5 μm



kv <dig> -sec24a binding assessment by membrane floatation assay
to further examine the association between kv <dig>  and sec24a, we used a membrane flotation assay to demonstrate that kv <dig>  is a client of sec24a. kv <dig>  tetramers were characterized by native gel electrophoresis and negative stain electron microscopy  . these analyses showed that solubilized and purified protein remained tetrameric. interestingly, purified kv <dig>  proteins exchanged into the amphipol a8- <dig> appeared as a double band on 8 % sds-page. after addition of calf intestinal phosphatase , the double band collapsed to a single band . these results agree with previous studies that showed how kv <dig>  could exist at multiple molecular weights depending on its state of phosphorylation  <cit> . solubilized but non-dephosphorylated tetramers were then reconstituted into lipid bilayers, producing proteoliposomes . proteoliposomes are less dense than protein alone and floated to the top of a 25 % sucrose layer after centrifugation . when kv <dig>  proteoliposomes were incubated with sec24a <dig>  proteins, both kv <dig>  and sec24a <dig> were detected in the top fraction  while sec24a <dig> proteins in the absence of kv <dig>  and or control liposomes  were not detected in the top fraction but were concentrated in the middle and bottom fractions . interestingly, when kv <dig>  in detergent micelles was mixed with sec24a <dig> proteins in the presence of control liposomes, kv <dig>  and sec24a <dig> proteins are found in the top fraction . this is attributed to the fact that kv <dig>  in detergent micelles can reconstitute into membranes and therefore recruit sec24a <dig>  this was verified by incubating either solubilized kv <dig>  proteins or sec24a <dig> proteins in the presence of control liposomes. in these cases, kv <dig>  was found in the top fraction  while sec24a <dig> proteins were not . neither solubilized kv <dig>  nor sec24a <dig> float in the absence of lipids . these results further demonstrate that kv <dig>  is a bona fide client of sec24a.fig.  <dig>

discussion
our results have shown that there is a modest yet measurable dependence on the acidic motif  found within kv <dig>  to promote anterograde transport through the copii mediated early secretory pathway. our data indicate that the canonical di-acidic motif under investigation is an alternative moderator of er exiting, and likely functions together with the downstream signal e483-e <dig> found by martínez-mármol et al  <cit>  to promote robust and efficient trafficking of kv <dig>  proteins. adding to the complexity of kv channel trafficking dynamics is the fact that kv channels are known to form heteromeric assemblies. a heteromeric kv <dig>  channel containing one or more different alpha subunit that possesses an intact er export motif would be able bypass the kv <dig>  trafficking defect and enter the anterograde secretory pathway  <cit> . furthermore, kv channels have several interacting partners, such as the kv beta subunit and the 14-3- <dig> proteins , each of which are capable of rescuing a defect within the secretory pathway. these interactions likely all work together to facilitate robust and efficient kv <dig>  trafficking in the cell.

we have shown that deletion of the c-terminus of kv <dig>  produces a dramatic er retention. this finding is in good agreement with other recent investigations that probed the trafficking defect produced after removal of the kv <dig>  c-terminus  <cit> . our patch clamp analysis demonstrated that there is little to no current at the plasma membrane of hek  <dig> cells expressing the kv <dig> -egfp Δc protein. we were not able to distinguish whether lack of current indicates that the kv <dig> -egfp Δc protein was retained due to improper folding within the er. previous structural and biophysical characterization of kv channels has found that the c-terminus of shaker channels are intrinsically disordered  <cit> . it is likely that deleting the disordered c-terminus of kv <dig>  would have a minimal effect, or none at all, on the tertiary and quaternary structure of kv <dig> . taken together, we judge that removal of the kv <dig>  c-terminus probably impacts less upon protein folding and is more likely a functional loss of the er export motif resulting in retention of the channel within the er.

vsvg has been well documented to contain a di-acidic exit motif and to interact with the sec24a and sec24b isoforms  <cit> . by using vsvg-cerulean as a trafficking control, we showed that the intracellular kv <dig>  trafficking profile is similar to that of vsvg in the presence and absence of sirnas targeting individual sec <dig> isoforms. when the kv <dig> -egfp trafficking profile is observed together with vsvg-cerulean, there is a strong overlap between the two cargo proteins. when either or both sec24a and sec24b are knocked down, both kv <dig>  and vsvg are strongly retained. this demonstrates a strong dependence of kv <dig>  on sec24a or sec24b. furthermore, we have shown that sec24a <dig> directly binds membrane reconstituted or detergent solubilized kv <dig>  proteins using a membrane floatation assay. this in vitro interaction supports the in vivo data that suggested kv <dig>  is a client of sec24a.

we have investigated the requirement for kv <dig>  channels to exit the er by an acidic motif dependent mechanism. even though the atomic architectures of kv channels are starting to be elucidated, ambiguities still exist in how these proteins are processed and eventually targeted to their functional domains. li et al  <cit>  were the first to propose the vxxsl er exit motif for kv <dig> channels. this motif, however, is not conserved in the kv <dig>  channel. zhu et al  <cit>  showed that trafficking of kv <dig> , kv <dig> , and kv <dig>  channels depend on a conserved c-terminal set of residues including an hrete motif, which overlaps with the residues we tested in kv <dig> . moreover, the hrete motif was not completely targeted by martínez-mármol et al  <cit> , but a notable trafficking defect was observed when the e445a  residue was mutated. in that study, martínez-mármol et al  <cit>  showed that trafficking of kv <dig>  critically depends on the e483-e <dig> acidic residues, and demonstrated an in vivo interaction with sec24d  <cit> . those authors make note that sec24d co-localized with kv <dig>  only in the presence of elevated copii coat protein sar1b that functions to recruit the rest of the coat to the er membrane. furthermore, it has been well documented that sec24d  interacts with a stretch of hydrophobic residues while the sec24a and b isoforms interact with a di-acidic motif . it remains an open topic as to how the non-canonical di-acidic motif of kv <dig>  would associate with the sec24d isoform. martínez-mármol et al  <cit>  used computational modeling to model the structure of the kv <dig>  c-terminus in association with sec24a in lieu of sec24d. they postulated that kv <dig>  contacts sec24a in their modeled structure and by extension sec24d in vivo by forming two salt bridges between e483-e <dig> of the homology modeled kv <dig>  c-terminus  and r <dig>  r <dig>  and y <dig> of sec <dig> ). though an explicit interaction between kv <dig>  and sec24d cannot be ruled out, it remains unclear as to how the exclusive nature of this reported selectivity would be preserved if the e483-e <dig> residues could potentially bind any sec <dig> isoform. our sec <dig> knockdown experiments, however, show that kv <dig>  exhibits a trafficking dependence on the sec24a and sec24b isoforms, which satisfies the current paradigm of how di-acidic motifs interact with the copii cargo recruitment subunit isoforms.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the trafficking mechanism by which kv <dig>  exits the er and travels through the anterograde early secretory pathway was explored. it was found that kv <dig>  is partially retained within the er after complete mutation of the exexe motif that is located between residues 443- <dig> of mouse kv <dig> , and nearly completely retained upon truncation of the c-terminus. furthermore, kv <dig>  was shown to associate directly with the copii cargo adaptor subunit sec24a in vitro using a membrane flotation assay. moreover, these results agree with previous studies aimed at unraveling the mechanism by which kv <dig>  exits the er and travels through the anterograde early secretory pathway  <cit> . finally, these results could potentially aid in the development of pharmaceuticals directed towards autoimmune disease associated with the mis-targeting of kv <dig> channels in vivo  <cit> .
