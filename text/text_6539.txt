BACKGROUND
mirnas are endogenously expressed, single-stranded rnas ~ <dig> nucleotides  in length  <cit> . in animals, mirnas are transcribed as long primary mirna  sequences that are processed in the nucleus to give precursor sequences of mirna . the pre-mirna sequences are exported to the cytoplasm where they are cleaved to produce mature mirnas. the mirnas are then incorporated into rna-induced silencing complexes where they function either to inhibit translation or to mediate the degradation of their target mrnas commonly by binding to complementary regions in the 3' untranslated regions   <cit> . mirnas play a pivotal role in many cellular functions by regulating normal developmental and physiological processes  <cit> , and are involved in disease development  <cit> .

repetitive elements  include tandem repeats and interspersed repeats . interspersed repeats are responsible for gene  shuffling and duplication  <cit>  as well as for regulatory changes  <cit> . gene  shuffling and duplication leads to the de novo creation of protein domains  <cit>  or new protein sequences  <cit> . recently, many mirnas derived from repetitive elements have been identified in mammals and plants  <cit> . some transposable elements become integrated in multiple loci in the genome and evolve into different members of a mirna family. an example of this is the hsa-mir- <dig> family, the members of which are derived from made <dig> transposable elements  <cit> . some transposable elements surrounding mirnas have also been found to facilitate the expansion of mirna clusters  <cit> . as the evolution of many mirnas remains obscure, the analysis of mirnas derived from repetitive elements may facilitate the understanding of the evolution of mirnas.

here we report our study of the mir- <dig> gene family that has been experimentally verified in the human genome  <cit> . in mirbase , this family has  <dig> members distributed in the human genome. members of this family have recently been identified using computational methods in the chimpanzee and horse genomes  <cit> . we have found that all members of this family are derived from one transposon, the mer <dig> element  <cit> . the mer <dig> element is a type of dna transposable element with a 193-bp  consensus sequence that exists in eutherian species. mer <dig> elements are characterized by the presence of terminal inverted repeats and ta target site duplications that can form palindromic structures  <cit> . if integrated into the genome and transcribed, they may be processed into mirnas by the mirna processing machine. in this paper, we focus on mer53-derived mirnas in the human genome. first, we identified mer53-derived mirnas in known mirnas and scanned the human genome for their paralogs. next, the phylogenetic distribution and evolution dynamics of the mir- <dig> family were analyzed. finally, we investigated the functions of the predicted target genes and analyzed the over-representation of gene ontology terms and kegg pathways for this mirna family.

RESULTS
conservation evaluation of mer53-derived mirnas in the human genome
by comparing the genomic coordinates of human mirnas from mirbase v <dig>   <cit>  with the locations of repeats annotated by repeatmasker  <cit>  in the human genome, we found  <dig> mer53-derived mirna genes that can encode hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig> , hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> . in mirbase v <dig> , there were eight members of the hsa-mir- <dig> family. four identical copies of hsa-mir-1302- <dig> were identified on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> . in the later updates of mirbase, hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> were renamed as hsa-mir-1302- <dig> , hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  and hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  respectively. the ids of the other members of the mir- <dig> family are unchanged. except for hsa-mir-1302- <dig>  the coverage densities of mer <dig> sequences to these pre-mirnas are 100% . it is interesting that all  <dig> of the mer53-derived mirna genes that we identified, developed into one mature mirna, hsa-mir- <dig> .

the average phastcons conservation scores of pre-mirna sequences have been used to determine the conservation of pre-mirna. in our study, the average phastcons conservation scores of hsa-mir- <dig> members are much lower than the thresholds used in previous studies   <cit> .

potential paralogs of the mir- <dig> family in the human genome
of the  <dig>  mer <dig> elements annotated in the hg <dig> genome assembly, we identified  <dig> mer <dig> elements that may encode mirnas . eight of the  <dig> potential sequences overlap with experimentally verified mir- <dig> precursor sequences  <cit>  that are distributed on different chromosomes . hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> were not identified by our method as their multi-branched loops were filtered out by the mipred program and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> was not identified because the selected region did not meet our criterion to be a pre-mirna. thus, we have identified  <dig> mer <dig> elements that may encode mirnas belonging to the mir- <dig> family and that have not yet been reported in the human genome.

phylogenetic distribution of orthologs of the human mir- <dig> family
the  <dig> orthologs  of the hsa-mir- <dig> family, identified as described in materials and methods, were only found in placental mammals, suggesting that the mir- <dig> family is a placental-specific gene family. of these,  <dig> orthologs from  <dig> species were validated as mirna using mipred  <cit>  . the  <dig> species are chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, rhesus, marmoset, tarsier, mouse lemur, bushbaby, tree shrew, guinea pig, rabbit, alpaca, dolphin, cow, horse, cat, microbat, megabat, elephant, rock hyrax and sloth . although there are four copies of the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> gene in the human genome, only one ortholog was found in the genomes of all  <dig> species.

mer <dig> elements are only found in eutherian species   <cit> . because eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials and monotremes  <dig> and  <dig> million years ago, respectively  <cit> , the homologs of the hsa-mir- <dig> family in placental mammals may all be derived from mer <dig> elements, explaining why homologs of the mir- <dig> family are not found in opossum and platypus . from this, we can infer that mer <dig> elements and mer53-derived mirna genes emerged at the early stage of the recent  <dig> million years since eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials.

during evolution, many mir- <dig> genes have been gained and lost . to estimate the gain and loss of mir- <dig> genes during evolution, we have used the previously reported parsimony method  <cit>  to infer that mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig>  and mir-1302- <dig> evolved after the mer <dig> elements had been inserted and fixed. for example, mir-1302- <dig>  mir-1302- <dig> and mir-1302- <dig> gene are present in human and marmoset but absent in other species such as tarsier, suggesting that these genes were generated in the ancestor of human and marmoset and lost in tarsier . in addition, in the tarsier genome the orthologs of mir-1302- <dig> and mir-1302- <dig> are further diverged than other mirna genes . in humans, three additional hsa-mir-1302- <dig> genes and one hsa-mir-1302- <dig> have been duplicated from the original hsa-mir-1302- <dig> . the mirna gene family has experienced repeated gene duplication and while some of the duplicated genes have diverged functionally others have become pseudo genes or have been deleted from the genome of these species. this pattern is clearly shown in figure  <dig> 

previous workers have pointed out that if the gene members of a family evolve in a birth-and-death manner the genes will cluster by type and not by species, while under the concerted model they will cluster by species  <cit> . except for hsa-1302- <dig> and hsa-1302- <dig> that are produced from recent segmental duplication events and cluster together, the mir- <dig> genes do not show a within-species clustering pattern . combining the evolutionary divergence between sequences information  and the results of previous analysis, we can infer that the mir- <dig> genes evolved in a birth-and-death manner.

segmental duplication and alu repeats mediate the expansion of the mir- <dig> gene in the human genome
it is known that some protein-coding gene families expanded by segmental duplication events  <cit> . some of the eleven members of the hsa-mir- <dig> family are remarkably similar. there are four identical copies of the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> gene on different chromosomes and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> differ at only two nucleotide positions . we therefore hypothesize that, in addition to the mer <dig> transposition effect, segmental duplication events may have contributed to the expansion of the hsa-mir- <dig> family. if this is correct, then some members of the family should be located in regions of segmental duplications. we find that five of the mirna genes  are indeed located in segmental duplications  thus supporting this view. as shown in table  <dig>  there are  <dig> non-redundant segmental duplication pairs in the human genome, some of which overlap. the relationship between these duplications is shown in figure  <dig> where each duplication pair is linked by a line. the mir- <dig> gene and the neighboring genes in each duplication region are shown in additional file  <dig>  in each of the segmental duplication pairs, the gene members are similar and the gene order is either identical or in the opposite direction . this is powerful evidence supporting our thesis that the mir- <dig> gene and its neighbors evolved by segmental duplication events.

mir1302-3: has-mir-1302- <dig> on chr2:114057006-114057143

there is only a two-nucleotide difference between hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> , the same as the difference in the alignment of their corresponding mer <dig> sequences . this indicates that, owing to dna segmental duplication, the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> sequence was also duplicated. when the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> gene underwent duplication, as part of the evolution process, it is possible that mutations occurred resulting in a new gene, hsa-mir-1302- <dig> 

because they have not been found in regions of segmental duplication, the other hsa-mir- <dig> genes may be products of mer <dig> transposition events alone. to determine if they were also formed by segmental duplication events, we analyzed the  <dig> paralogs of the hsa-mir- <dig> family that we identified in the human genome . we found that, like most of the members of the hsa-mir- <dig> family, none of them were located in regions of segmental duplications.

alu-mediated recombination events may facilitate the expansion of segmental duplications through recombination  <cit>  as well as mediate the expansion of mirna genes  <cit> . alu-mediated recombination creates mosaic alu elements at the recombination junctions. consequently, the junction alu elements exhibit marked sequence divergence when compared with internal alus  <cit> . in the present study, we find that for most of the segmental duplications only one of the ends  adjoins one or more of the alu sequences . further, the distribution pattern of alusp--alujo-aluyc-alujr-alusx is present in all of these duplication sequences . therefore, we have used alusp, alujo, aluyc, alujr and alusx as internal alu elements. of the  <dig> duplication pairs, six pairs have alu elements located at the junction and these were used in the present analysis. interestingly, we find no significant sequence divergence among the internal alu pairs , but the sequence divergence between the junction alu pairs and the internal alu pairs is considerable , indicating that the junction alu pairs have diverged more than the internal alu pairs . we therefore suggest that during the evolution of the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> genes, alu-mediated recombined events have facilitated the expansion of the segmental duplications that harbor them.

target prediction and functional analysis
the function of hsa-mir- <dig> is still unknown. we have analyzed the targets of the mature human mir- <dig> in an attempt to explore its potential function. in the human genome,  <dig>  target genes are predicted by both pita  <cit>   and targetscan  <cit>  . we used the  <dig>  target genes at the intersection between the two predicted gene sets as valid targets . ninety-one of the targetscan predicted conserved sites  and  <dig>  of the targetscan predicted poorly conserved sites were identified in the  <dig>  valid target gene data set. to determine the functions and pathways that may involve hsa-mir- <dig>  all the valid targets of hsa-mir- <dig> were annotated using webgestalt  <cit>  and kegg  <cit> . the  <dig>  target genes are widely distributed across all the chromosomes  and are expressed in most tissues of the body. the highest expression levels are in the nervous system, and lowest are in the soft tissue and in the adrenal medulla . in the nervous tissue, the genes are enriched in intracellular membrane-bounded organelles and in the synapse . functionally, the target genes are over-represented in transportation, localization, system development processes, and in the positive regulation of cellular processes. they may also play a role in binding and transcription regulation . overall, these predicted target genes are implicated in cell proliferation and cell division, metabolism, development and in the immune response. in the pancreas some of the genes have roles in the insulin-related signal pathway and in pancreas pathology, while in the nervous system some are involved in learning, memory, and signal transduction and are implicated in neural disease development . the kegg annotation indicates that some of the target genes are involved in diseases and are enriched in pathways that lead to glioma, chronic myeloid leukemia, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, type ii diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative disorders such as alzheimer's disease, and pathogenic escherichia coli infection . as mir- <dig> was first identified in pluripotent human embryonic stem cells and embryoid bodies  <cit>  and is enriched in pathways to cancer, it may influence the biological processes taking place in stem cells, in tumor cells and in the early embryo.

discussion
recently, mirnas that originate from repetitive elements have been identified in mammals and plants  <cit> . here we report a microrna family, the mir- <dig> family, which originates from the dna transposable element, mer <dig>  mer <dig> is a medium reiteration frequency, non-autonomous dna transposon related to the mariner family. mer <dig> elements can form palindromic stem-loop structures   <cit> . once an mer <dig> element becomes inserted into the genome in the region of an active transcription and is fixed by natural selection, it may be transcribed and processed by the enzyme machine system of mirna into mirnas. previous studies have shown that transposable-element-derived mirnas are less conserved than non-transposable-element-derived mirnas  <cit> . however, we find that the average conservation scores for the mir- <dig> genes are very low . because quite a few orthologs of the precursors of human mir- <dig> are found  in eutherian mammals, we suggest that the mer <dig> elements and mer53-derived mirna genes may have evolved after eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials and monotremes as recently as  <dig> million years ago. in placental species, many mir- <dig> genes have been gained and lost, indicating that they may have evolved following the birth-and-death model of evolution. it should be noted that the parsimony reconstruction of gain and loss of the mir- <dig> genes is influenced by the fact that the mir- <dig> genes were first identified in the human genome and the orthologs in other species were identified using computational approaches. nevertheless, the theoretical approach is a good starting point for deducing the evolution mode for mirna families.

mirnas, like protein-coding genes, form gene families and like mir <dig> in plants, many of the pre-mirnas produce either similar or identical mature mirnas  <cit> . these pre-mirnas are classified as one family. the following questions arise: how do mirna genes evolve to become mirna families? what is the evolution dynamics of these mirna genes? and are their evolutionary patterns the same as those for protein-coding gene families? previous studies have shown that the expansion of mirna families usually occurs through tandem or segmental duplications  <cit> . in the present study, we have focused on the precursors of human mir- <dig>  because genes of the mir- <dig> family are found on several chromosomes, we investigated the possibility that they too evolved through segmental duplication events. we suggest that besides the transposition effect of the mer <dig> elements, the four copies of hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and the one copy of hsa-mir-1302- <dig> were produced through segmental duplication events. when alu sequences are near or at the boundaries of the duplication units they are known to mediate the expansion of segmental duplications through recombination. our results indicate that the hsa-mir-1302- <dig> and hsa-mir-1302- <dig> genes may have evolved because of alu-mediated recombination events. however, this mechanism apparently does not apply to other members of the human mir- <dig> family or to potential paralogs in the human genome. they may have evolved by the transposition of mer <dig> elements alone.

small rnas regulate gene expression in many ways: they mediate antiviral responses; they play a role in the organization of chromosomal domains; and they restrain the spread of selfish genetic elements. small rnas guide transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing machinery to specific target sequences that include genes and transposable elements  <cit> . the target genes of mir- <dig> are over-represented in functions that require the binding of metal ions and binding to dna. they are mainly involved in metabolism, regulation of cellular physiological processes, signal transduction and transport. the mer53-derived mirnas may, therefore, play important roles in cell proliferation and cell division, metabolism, development, pancreas physiology and pathology, nervous system physiology, diseases and in the immune response. because the functions of mir- <dig> have been predicted and predictions notoriously produce a large number of false-positives, a better method to assign a function to mir- <dig> would be to combine the expression profiles of the mirnas and the target genes. this is a study that we would like to do in the future.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study, we report the origin and evolution of the mir- <dig> family in the human genome. overall, we have identified  <dig> novel potential paralogs of mir- <dig> genes in the human genome and  <dig> orthologs of the human mir- <dig> genes in  <dig> placental species. our data show that all members of mir- <dig> family are derived from mer <dig> elements and we have proposed that they emerged at the early stage of the recent  <dig> million years since eutherian mammals diverged from marsupials. segmental duplication events have facilitated the expansion of the mir- <dig> family while the expansion of these segmental duplications may also have been facilitated by alu-alu-mediated recombination events. because, in placental species many mir- <dig> genes have been gained and lost, we have proposed that their development proceeded according to the birth-and-death model of evolution. furthermore, we have found that the predicted target genes of mir- <dig> are over-represented in transportation, localization, and in system development processes as well as in the positive regulation of cellular processes. many of the potential target genes are predicted to function in binding and transcription regulation.
