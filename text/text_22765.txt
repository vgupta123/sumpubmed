BACKGROUND
a number of α-helical transmembrane  proteins organize themselves in supramolecular assemblies, which constitute the functional units  of ion/water channels, electron or proton transfer proteins as well as transporters  <cit> . also the 7-tm bacteriorhodopsin  forms trimers, which, in turn, form multimolecular assemblies in the native purple membrane  <cit> . g-protein-coupled receptors , which constitute the largest superfamily of membrane proteins, are not exceptions to this rule. although they have been classically assumed to exist and function as monomeric entities, the concept that they exist as constitutive dimers/oligomers is now substantiated by ever increasing evidences from in vitro studies . predictions of the likely interfaces in gpcr dimers done so far essentially relied on sequence-based methods  <cit>  .

despite the demonstrated constitutive and functional importance of supramolecular assemblies of tm subunits or proteins, effective tools other than sequence-based methods for structure predictions of such assemblies are still lacking. indeed, almost all the docking algorithms and approaches to quaternary structure predictions developed so far work with water-soluble proteins and most of them employ geometrical constraints, including symmetry information  <cit> . the very few approaches intended for quaternary structure predictions of tm-helical proteins include a method based on monte carlo sampling of single tm helices  <cit> . the method is limited to very simple homo-oligomers and requires knowledge about the oligomerization state of the protein, since symmetry information is used to filter the most realistic solutions. the information from cryo-electron microscopy and evolutionary data is employed by an alternative automated method for orienting tm helices  <cit> . the method has been probed on a number of membrane proteins, including the multimeric tm portion of the acetylcholine receptor  <cit> . another docking method, i.e. gramm  <cit> , can deal with predictions of helix-helix packing interactions involving either water-soluble or tm-systems. in fact, gramm can run in a "helix docking mode" that discards configurations with large displacements along the helix axes and angles between helices larger than indicated cutoffs  <cit> . this is instrumental in saving computational time and facilitating the analysis of the docking results.

herein, we present an approach based upon rigid body docking simulations, membrane topology-based filtering, and cluster analysis to predict the quaternary structure of homo-oligomeric integral membrane proteins. this approach does not employ symmetry constraints either for improving sampling or in the filtering step. furthermore, there are no size-limitations in the systems under study, which are not limited to the tm domains but include also the water-soluble portions.

benchmarks of the approach were first carried out on the tetrameric kcsa potassium channel h+ gated   <cit> , pentameric mscl and eptameric mscs mechanosensitive channels   <cit> , respectively), and trimeric brd   <cit> . selection of these supramolecular systems followed an accurate inspection of the database of membrane protein structures from white's laboratory  <cit> . the selected proteins, indeed, fulfilled at best the following requirements:  the biological unit is a homo-oligomer;  the asymmetric crystallographic unit contains the biological unit;  the monomers in the biological unit are α-helical tm proteins; and  significant structural diversity exists among the selected oligomers concerning oligomeric order, architecture and extension of the intracellular and extracellular domains. successively, benchmarks have been extended to a number of homo-oligomeric transmembrane proteins, selected from the same database, for which the asymmetric unit is constituted by the monomer. they include a dimer, i.e. the membrane spanning region of the btucd vitamin b <dig> transporter   <cit> ; trimers like the amtb ammonia channel   <cit>  and the acrb bacterial multi-drug efflux transporter ; and tetramers like the aqp <dig> aquaporin water channel   <cit> , the glpf glycerol facilitator channel   <cit> , and the kirbac <dig> inward-rectifier potassium channel   <cit> .

the structure of the biological unit from the pdb, obtained by symmetry operations, was used as a native complex for each of these proteins.

for all the systems under study, the approach led to native-like quaternary structures, i.e. with a root mean square deviation of the cα-atoms  lower than  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer, regardless of the resolution of the structural models.

the effectiveness of the approach makes it suitable for predictions of the supramolecular architecture of other integral membrane proteins.

RESULTS
the computational approach developed in this study consists of a number of dense docking samplings, starting from the docking of two identical copies of a given monomer. each docking run is followed by membrane topology filtering and cluster analysis. thus, prediction of the native oligomer is accomplished by a number of progressive growing steps, each made of one docking run, filtering and cluster analysis ).

the only requirement with this approach is the structural model of the monomer and the knowledge of a set of cα-atoms, which lie at the two lipid/water interfaces, defining two parallel planes. in the target monomer, these two planes must be parallel to the xy plane and, hence, perpendicular to the z-axis. if these planes are parallel to the xy plane and, hence, perpendicular to the z-axis, the orientation of the monomer is considered good and no reorientation is needed. in contrast, if such planes are not parallel to the xy plane, the monomer needs a reorientation. this reorientation is done by computing the rotations necessary to bring the two planes parallel to the xy plane and then using an average between the two rotations to reorient the whole monomer. the correct membrane topology of the target monomer is, indeed, necessary for the membrane topology filter to work properly .

the following paragraphs summarize the results of benchmarks done on ten selected oligomers.

quaternary structure predictions of oligomeric channels: kcsa, mscl and mscs
the a subunit of kcsa is constituted by  <dig> amino acids  organized in two tm α-helices connected by the  <dig> amino acid pore region  <cit> . the a subunit extracted from the crystal structure was used both as a target and a probe in the first step, and as a probe in the following docking simulations. prior to the first docking run, a reorientation of the kcsa a subunit was needed to put it in the right orientation with respect to the putative membrane. two different ways for reorienting the subunit were probed, i.e. a dipole moment-based approach and a membrane topology-based approach. the first consisted in rotating the native oligomer so as to put the dipole moment of the tetramer parallel to the z-axis and then extracting the a subunit. the second consisted in the following steps:  prediction of two sets of cα-atoms of the monomer, which lie at the two membrane-water interfaces;  determination of the planes that fit at best these sets of atoms; and  orientation of these planes parallel to the xy plane. the first reorientation approach, applied to the native oligomer, was instrumental in designing and benchmarking the prediction protocol, whereas the second approach, applied to the monomer, is instrumental in blind predictions.

quaternary structure predictions of kcsa consisted of two alternative two-step growing paths differing for the fact that one employed a trimer , whereas the other employed a dimer  as a target at step  <dig>  the two different paths shared in common step  <dig>  i.e. a vs a docking. a vs a docking gave  <dig> realistic solutions, i.e. those solutions, which passed the membrane topology filter. these solutions essentially grouped into two clusters, which also showed similar indices of membrane topology goodness . the best scored solutions from each of these two clusters, s <dig> and s <dig> , were selected for the following growing step. these solutions contributed to the growth of a cyclic oligomer, likely to represent subunits d and b, respectively, i.e. labeled in a clockwise manner as seen from the extracellular side . as for the path passing through an intermediate trimer, a vs a-bs1-ds <dig>  docking led to  <dig> realistic solutions, which essentially grouped in four clusters. the best scored solution from the third cluster , s <dig>  was selected to produce the a-bs1-cs500-ds <dig> tetramer. such tetramer was characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure .

hthe best predicted kcsa tetramer was achieved following a dipole-moment-based approach for a subunit reorientation. the same path, but using a membrane topology-based approach for a subunit reorientation, led to the a-bs2-cs12-ds <dig> tetramer characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer.

the alternative path passing through an intermediate dimer consisted of two parallel ways, depending on whether the a-bs <dig> or the a-ds <dig> dimer was employed as a target . in the first case,  <dig> realistic solutions were filtered, which essentially grouped in two clusters. the best solutions from each of these two clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were, respectively, characterized by contacts with the a and bs <dig> monomers in the target dimer, leading to the a-bs1-cs1-ds <dig> tetramer, which showed a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure . the parallel pathway, which used the a-ds <dig> dimer as a target at step  <dig>  led to  <dig> realistic solutions, which essentially grouped in two clusters characterized also by similar memtop indices . the best solutions from each of these two clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  led to the a-bs2-cs1-ds <dig> tetramer, showing a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure .

in summary, the three different growing paths shared in common the first step, i.e. a vs a docking, and all led to native-like tetramers . among these tetramers, the one obtained by employing a trimer as a target at step  <dig> showed the lowest cα-rmsd from the native complex . the intermediate and final oligomers, with only one exception, were made of solutions falling amongst the top four out of  <dig> in the respective output list . the results presented above were achieved by employing a dipole moment-based criterion for the initial reorientation of the target a subunit. however, employing a membrane topology-based approach for subunit reorientation equally led to native-like solutions. in fact, the path employing a trimer as a target at step  <dig> led to the a-bs2-cs12-ds <dig> tetramer, showing a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure, whereas one of the two paths employing a dimer as a target at step  <dig> led to the a-bs1-cs52-ds <dig> tetramer, showing a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure. also in this case, employing an intermediate trimer as a target at step  <dig> led to better predictions than employing a dimer.

the same general approaches were employed for quaternary structure predictions of the the pentameric mscl and eptameric mscs mechanosensitive channels, but neither one of the two systems required an initial reorientation of the monomer. in detail, the a subunit of the mscl is constituted by  <dig> amino acids , organized in two tm α-helices and a third cytoplasmic helix   <cit> . the a subunit of mscs is constituted by  <dig> amino acids , organized in three tm α-helices and a huge cytosolic domain   <cit> .

for mscl, two-step and three-step growing paths were probed, differing for the fact that the first path utilized a trimer , whereas the second one utilized a dimer  as a target at step  <dig>  similarly to the kcsa, the two different growing paths shared in common the first step, i.e. a vs a docking. thus, a vs a docking gave  <dig> realistic solutions, essentially grouped in two clusters, showing also similar memtop indices . as for the two-step growing path, the first run was instrumental in obtaining the a-bs5-es <dig> trimer by employing, simultaneously, the best scored solutions from the first two most populated clusters, s <dig> and s <dig> . a vs a-bs5-es <dig> docking led to  <dig> realistic solutions, which essentially grouped in the first two clusters. the best scored solutions from each of these clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were characterized by contacts with the bs <dig> and es <dig> monomers, respectively, closing the oligomeric cycle. the a-bs5-cs1-ds4-es <dig> pentamer showed a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native structure .

as for the three-step paths, the best scored solutions from the two most populated clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were used to produce the a-bs <dig> and a-es <dig> dimers. each of these two dimers was used in turn as a target in two parallel sets of docking simulations, which finally led to the a-bs5-cs3-ds2-es <dig> and a-bs8-cs1-ds1-es <dig> pentamers, characterized by almost comparable cα-rmsds, i.e.  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively, from the native oligomer . thus, employing a dimer as a target at step  <dig> was better than using a trimer . also, all the predicted pentamers were made of solutions falling amongst the top ten out of  <dig> in the respective output list .

for quaternary structure predictions of mscs, three-step and four-step growing paths were probed, differing for the fact that the first utilized a trimer , whereas the second utilized a dimer  as a target at step  <dig>  also in this case, the two different growing paths shared in common the first step, i.e. a vs a docking. thus, a vs a docking gave  <dig> realistic solutions, essentially grouped in two clusters showing also significantly low memtop indices .

as for the three-step growing path, the first run was instrumental in obtaining the a-bs3-gs <dig> trimer by using the best scored solutions from the first two most populated clusters, s <dig> and s <dig> . a vs a-bs3-gs <dig> docking led to  <dig> realistic solutions, which essentially grouped in the first two clusters. the best scored solutions from these clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were, respectively, characterized by contacts with the gs <dig> and bs <dig> monomers, likely to represent the f and c subunits. a vs a-bs3-cs3-fs1-gs <dig> docking produced  <dig> solutions essentially grouped in the first two clusters, showing also similar memtop indices . the best scored solution from each of these clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were, respectively, characterized by contacts with the fs <dig> and cs <dig> monomers and completed the oligomeric cycle, likely to be the e and d subunits, respectively. the thereof obtained a-bs3-cs3-ds3-es1-fs1-gs <dig> eptamer showed a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer .

as for the four-step paths, the best scored solutions from the first two most populated clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were used to produce the a-bs <dig> and a-gs <dig> dimers. these dimers were used in turn as a target in two parallel sets of docking simulations, which finally led to the a-bs3-cs3-ds1-es165-fs3-gs <dig> and a-bs3-cs1-ds1-es6-fs1-gs <dig> eptamers, characterized by cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å, respectively, from the native oligomer . in summary, the solutions constituting the three alternative eptamers, which were obtained following different paths, fell amongst the top ten out of  <dig> in the respective output list . also, one of the two four-step growing paths produced the eptamer with the lowest cα-rmsd from the native oligomer , whereas the other four-step growing path gave the worst eptamer in terms of cα-rmsd . since the two predicted quaternary structures are significantly different from each other , and contain large water-soluble domains, they were subjected to a quality check by means of the 3d-profile program  <cit> , to help selection of the best one. interestingly, for the native-like a-bs3-cs1-ds1-es6-fs1-gs <dig> eptamer, the 3d-profile score was higher than that of the alternative eptamer , quite indicative of a more suitable packing of the seven subunits.

quaternary structure predictions of brd
for brd, a vs a docking, followed by the application of the membrane topology filter, led to  <dig> solutions . these solutions essentially grouped in two clusters. one of these two clusters showed a better memtop index than the other cluster  and was, thus, used to select the best scored solution, leading to the a-bs <dig> dimer. a vs a-bs <dig> docking led to  <dig> solutions, grouped in seven clusters. the solution selected based upon the criteria described above, s <dig>  led to the a-bs162-cs <dig> trimer, characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native trimer . this is a striking result, considering also that the lipid molecules, which are present at the interfaces between the monomers in the crystal structure of the trimer, were completely neglected in docking simulations. furthermore, the predicted trimer is made of identical monomers, whereas, in the crystal structure of the oligomer, slight differences exist between the monomers, concerning their internal coordinates and the main-chain length.

we probed also a different crystal structure of brd, 1kme  <cit> . this structure differs from the one extracted from the native oligomer both in the backbone  and side-chain conformations. following exactly the same path and approach as those used for the monomer extracted from the native trimer, a trimer was achieved characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer. it is worth noting that such cα-rmsd value comprises also the structural differences between the monomers in the native and predicted trimers.

quaternary structure predictions of the set of membrane proteins for which the asymmetric unit did not correspond to the biological unit
the subset of membrane proteins, kcsa, mscl and mscs and brd, for which the asymmetric units corresponded to the biological unit, were employed for setting the prediction protocol. benchmarks were then extended to a number of homo-oligomers, for which the asymmetric unit did not contain the biologic unit that was, hence, obtained by symmetry operations. these oligomers included: the tetrameric aqp <dig>  glpf and kirbac <dig>  the trimeric amtb and acrb, as well as the dimeric btucd.

in detail, for the tetrameric aqp <dig>  glpf and kirbac <dig>  the same growing paths as those employed for quaternary structure predictions of kcsa were probed. similarly to kcsa, for these proteins, the two-step growing paths ,  and  always resulted into native-like tetramers. in detail, for aqp <dig>  the predicted tetramers  showed, respectively, cα-rmsds equal to  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer . for glpf, the predicted tetramers  showed, respectively, cα-rmsds equal to  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å, and  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer . finally, for kirbac <dig>  the predicted tetramers  showed, respectively, cα-rmsds equal to  <dig>  Å,  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from the native oligomer . it is worth noting that, for all the predicted structures, the docking solutions contributing to each tetramer fell among the top  <dig> solutions out of  <dig> in the output list. furthermore, similarly to kcsa, for aqp <dig> and glpf, the growing path, which employs a trimer as a target at step  <dig> ), produced the best native-like tetramer .

differently from brd, for amtb and acrb, the memtop indices of the two most populated clusters from the first docking step were similar. this made it possible to achieve trimers following either path  or  or  . in detail, for amtb, a vs a docking led to  <dig> solutions essentially grouped in two equi-populated clusters showing also good and similar memtop indices . the best scored solutions from these two clusters, s <dig> and s <dig>  were likely to form the c and b subunits, respectively. the a-bs7-cs <dig> trimer was characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native trimer. a vs a-bs <dig> and a vs a-cs <dig> docking, led to  <dig> and  <dig> reliable solutions, respectively, which essentially grouped in one cluster. the best solution from this cluster, s <dig>  in both cases, led to the a-bs7-cs <dig> and a-bs1-cs <dig> native-like trimers characterized, respectively, by cα-rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from the native trimer . for acrb, a vs a docking led to  <dig> solutions, essentially grouped in two clusters showing low and similar memtop indices . the best scored solutions from these two clusters led to the a-bs4-cs <dig> trimer showing a cα-rmsd equal to  <dig>  Å from the native trimer. a vs a-bs <dig> and a vs a-cs <dig> docking, led to  <dig> and  <dig> reliable solutions, respectively, which essentially grouped in one cluster. the best solution from this cluster, s <dig> in both cases, led to the a-bs4-cs <dig> and a-bs1-cs <dig> native-like trimers characterized, respectively, by cα-rmsds of  <dig>  Å and  <dig>  Å from the native trimer .

for btucd, whose membrane-spanning domain is a dimer, a vs a docking led to  <dig> solutions distributed in  <dig> small clusters. since the cluster population in this case is meaningless, we considered only the cluster characterized by the best memtop index . the lowest scored solution from this cluster, s <dig>  led to a dimer characterized by a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native complex . these results were achieved following a dipole moment-based approach for subunit reorientation . the membrane topology-based reorientation approach, led to  <dig> reliable solutions,  <dig> of which were divided into  <dig> clusters, whereas the remaining  <dig> couldn't be clusterized. the  <dig> unique solutions contained the native-like dimer, characterized by one of the best memtop index and a cα-rmsd of  <dig>  Å from the native complex. however, in this case, retrieving the native-like solution couldn't be unequivocally done, as it didn't hold either the best zdock score or the best memtop index.

discussion
following benchmarks, we have defined an effective computational protocol to predict the supramolecular structure of integral α-helical tm proteins, starting from the monomer. the approach was first tested on the trimeric brd, tetrameric kcsa, pentameric mscl and eptameric mscs. these systems were selected following an accurate database search for high resolution structures of oligomeric membrane proteins, significantly different from each other and whose asymmetric crystallographic unit contains the biological unit. docking samplings on these proteins were instrumental in setting the structure prediction protocol. benchmarks were then extended to a number of homo-oligomers, for which the asymmetric unit did not contain the biologic unit that was, hence, obtained by symmetry operations. these oligomers included: the dimeric btucd, the trimeric amtb and acrb, and the tetrameric aqp <dig>  glpf and kirbac <dig> 

for all the considered systems, native-like quaternary structures were achieved regardless of the resolution of the structural models and the extensions of the tm and water-exposed domains , thus, proving the effectiveness of the prediction approach. the latter consists in a number of dense docking samplings, starting from the docking of two identical copies of a given monomer. each docking run is followed by membrane topology filtering and cluster analysis. thus, prediction of the native oligomer is accomplished by a number of progressive growing steps, each made of one docking run, filtering and cluster analysis .

the only requirement with this approach is the structural model of the monomer that must hold the proper membrane topology. the correct membrane topology of the monomer, which in the first docking run of each growing path is employed in two identical copies , is, indeed, necessary for the membrane topology filter to work properly. this filter generally discards more than 94% of the total solutions provided by each docking run , thus allowing for an easy individuation of the clusters holding the native-like solutions. these clusters are, in fact, the one or two most populated, and hold also the best membrane topology indices, i.e a memtop index close to zero. for almost all the docking runs, the best hit from the selected clusters fall within the first  <dig> out of the  <dig> output solutions provided by the docking algorithm.

a significant number of trials on the four highly different systems brd, kcsa, mscl and mscs allowed us to define the best criteria for selecting the proper docking solutions at each growing step and the best growing path. these criteria proved validity in quaternary structure predictions of the second set of membrane proteins.

selection of the proper solution/s at each growing step should be based on the docking score as well as on the population and membrane topology of the solution clusters. in detail, if the realistic solutions group essentially in two clusters characterized also by similar and significantly low memtop indices, the best scored solutions from both clusters should be selected to grow the oligomer. in contrast, if the two most populated clusters have significantly different memtop indices, only the one showing the lowest index must be chosen for extracting the best scored solution. finally, if one cluster is significantly most populated than the others, only that cluster must be considered for extracting the best scored solution.

as for the growing paths, in general, those should be pursued, which employ a dimeric target in the second step . for cyclic oligomers, our approach is able to predict the oligomeric order of the functional unit, since completion of the cycle determines the end of the growth. once established the oligomeric order, for systems like kcsa, aqp <dig> and glpf, which are characterized by an even number of monomers, a growing path, which employs a trimer as a target at step  <dig>  is worth attempting. in fact, in our benchmarks, this path led to the best tetramer, in terms of cα-rmsd from the native structure ). based on these results, we infer that, for even order oligomers, growing paths characterized by the employment of a trimeric target at step  <dig> may be preferred, whereas, for odd order oligomers, the preferential growing paths are those employing a dimeric target at step  <dig>  interestingly, both these paths share the characteristic that, in the final step, only one monomer is needed to complete the oligomer, i.e. to close the cycle. for odd order oligomers, this would imply pursuing two parallel growing paths, finally leading to two predicted quaternary structures. when the two predicted oligomers differ significantly from each other, quality checks are needed to select the final structure. in our study, this was the case of the mscs oligomer . in fact, the two parallel growing paths passing through a dimeric target led to two significantly different oligomers . in this case, given the significant extension of the water-exposed domains compared to the tm ones, the 3d-profile score proved effectiveness in individuating the native-like oligomer.

for non-cyclic oligomers, the growth of the supramolecular assembly must stop when no more realistic solutions can be found. low resolution information from atomic force microscopy  or cryo-electron microscopy, if available, should be combined with the results of docking analysis. we couldn't do benchmarks on non-cyclic oligomers characterized by oligomeric orders higher than two or three due to the lack of high resolution structures for such systems. as an example, for brd, we stopped the growth at the trimer, since the native structure, required for benchmarks, is available only for the trimer. however, we know from afm images that brd trimers organize in higher order oligomers  <cit> . preliminary results of trimer vs trimer docking, reconstructed a brd esamer similar to that inferred from afm images   <cit> . we observed that the number of filtered solutions decreases significantly ongoing from monomer vs monomer to trimer vs trimer docking . this is in line with the fact that intra-trimer contacts should be stronger than the inter-trimer ones, which are mediated also by lipid molecules.

the effectiveness of predictions is independent of the content of water-exposed domains in the monomeric units, suggestive of the fundamental role of the tm domains in driving the supramolecular organization.

an important result is that predictions were excellent also for those systems, for which the asymmetric unit consists of the monomer and not of the biologic unit. these may be considered as unbound-unbound docking cases. moreover, quaternary structure predictions can not be considered as bound-bound docking cases neither for those cases, in which the crystallographic asymmetric unit contains the biologic unit, and, hence, the monomer used for simulations was extracted from the x-ray structure of the complex. in fact, in none of the docking steps the situation is such that probe and target are the same components of the native complex. moreover, for brd, the predicted trimer is made of identical monomers, whereas, in the crystal structure of the oligomer, slight differences exist between the monomers, concerning their internal coordinates and the main-chain length. moreover, the lipid molecules, which are present at the interfaces between the monomers in the crystal structure of the trimer, were completely neglected in our docking simulations. the employment of an "unbound" brd structure   <cit> , differing both in the backbone and side-conformations from the monomer extracted from the native trimer did not prevent the approach from leading to a correct quaternary structure.

CONCLUSIONS
in conclusion, the benchmarks carried out in this study on ten homo-oligomeric membrane proteins with known quaternary structure validate the proposed structure prediction protocol that, for all the tested cases, led to native-like quaternary structures regardless of the resolution of the structural models.

quaternary structure predictions will be, hence, extended to other integral membrane proteins, including gpcrs. an attempt in this respect has been already reported, though based on an early and different version of the computational protocol, proving usefulness in aiding the interpretation of biophysical data and the design of novel in vitro experiments <cit>
