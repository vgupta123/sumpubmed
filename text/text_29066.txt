BACKGROUND
mutations in either the tsc <dig> gene on chromosome 9q <dig>  <cit> , or the tsc <dig> gene on chromosome 16p <dig>   <cit>  cause tuberous sclerosis complex   <cit>  and lymphangioleiomyomatosis   <cit> . tsc is an autosomal dominant disorder characterised by neurological symptoms, such as epilepsy and autism, and the development of hamartomas in a variety of organs and tissues, including the brain, skin and kidneys. lam is a progressive lung disease in women caused by abnormal smooth muscle cell proliferation. the tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> gene products, tsc <dig> and tsc <dig>  interact to form a protein complex  <cit> . the tsc <dig> n-terminal region and multiple regions of tsc <dig> are important for the tsc1-tsc <dig> interaction  <cit> . tsc <dig> contains a gtpase activating protein  domain, and the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex is the gap for the ras homolog expressed in brain  gtpase  <cit> . rheb-gtp activates the target of rapamycin  complex  <dig> , resulting in phosphorylation of torc <dig> targets, including p <dig> s <dig> kinase and the elongation factor 4e binding proteins  <cit> . although the tsc <dig> gap domain is of obvious functional importance, the role of tsc <dig> is less clear  <cit> . tsc <dig> stabilizes tsc <dig>  <cit>  and may be important for recruiting tsc <dig> to membranes  <cit> . it is also possible that tsc <dig> facilitates the formation of tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes containing multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits. tsc1-tsc <dig> oligomers would allow more sensitive allosteric control of tsc1-tsc <dig> activity  <cit> , as well as providing stability and protection against denaturation  <cit> .

previously, to investigate the structure of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex we performed gel filtration on detergent extracts of cultured cells, and estimated the size of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex as >  <dig> kda  <cit> . however, we have been unable to reproduce these results. in the present study, gel filtration experiments using cell extracts obtained by hypotonic lysis  <cit>  indicate that tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> form complexes up to ~ <dig> mda in size, suggesting that our previous analysis underestimated the size of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex. in line with our new findings and other results  <cit> , immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes contain multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits.

methods
constructs and antisera
an overview of the tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> proteins expressed during this study is given in additional file  <dig>  to express v5-tagged tsc <dig>  the tsc <dig> open reading frame  was cloned as a nhei-kpni fragment into pcdna <dig> /v5-his . the tobacco etch virus protease  recognition site  was introduced by site directed mutagenesis .

to generate v <dig> epitope-tagged tsc <dig> c-terminal truncation constructs, xhoi sites were introduced into a v5-tagged full-length tsc <dig> expression construct  <cit>  by site-directed mutagenesis. after excision of the 3' portions of the tsc <dig> orf with xhoi, the plasmids were re-circularised, leaving the epitope tag in-frame with the truncated orf. to generate n-terminal truncations, bamhi sites were introduced and the 5' portion of the tsc <dig> orf excised, leaving a truncated orf with a new translation initiation codon. expression constructs were derived for  <dig> c-terminal truncations: a614v <dig>  and a1153v <dig> , and  <dig> n-terminal truncations: m1028v <dig>  and m1453v <dig> . other constructs used in this study have been described elsewhere  <cit> . all constructs were verified by sequence analysis of the entire orf.

antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology  , roche molecular biochemicals  , invitrogen , santa cruz biotechnology   or were described previously  <cit> . secondary antibodies for the infra-red detection of blotted proteins were obtained from li-cor biosciences . blotted protein levels were estimated by near infra-red detection and quantification on an odysseytm scanner .

subcellular fractionation
hek 293t cells were washed and scraped into ice-cold phosphate buffered saline , pelleted by centrifugation , resuspended in hypotonic buffer  <cit> ) and drawn repeatedly through a fine-gauge hypodermic needle. crude nuclei and undisrupted cells were removed by centrifugation  and the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation . the supernatant, containing cytosolic proteins, was recovered and subjected to gel filtration. the pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer ) to extract additional proteins and disrupt any weak salt-sensitive interactions. after ultracentrifugation , the supernatant  was subjected to gel filtration. the pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer containing  <dig> % w/v triton x <dig> and, after centrifugation at  <dig>  <dig> g for  <dig> minutes at 4°c, the supernatant was subjected to gel filtration.

smart gel filtration
gel filtration was performed on the smart fast protein liquid chromatography apparatus  using a superose  <dig> column. the column was pre-equilibrated for  <dig> minutes prior to the injection of  <dig> μl cell extract. flowrate was set at  <dig> μl/min and the elution profile monitored at  <dig> nm. elution fractions  were collected and analysed by immunoblotting and compared to a series of molecular size markers: blue dextran , thyroglobulin , ferritin  and catalase . gel filtration was carried out in  <dig> mm hepes ph  <dig> ,  <dig> mm dtt,  <dig> mm nacl,  <dig> mm naf,  <dig> mm β-glycerophosphate,  <dig> mm edta. for analysis of the detergent extract,  <dig> % w/v triton x <dig> was included in the gel filtration buffer.

immunoprecipitation
hek 293t cells in  <dig> cm dishes were transfected with expression constructs using polyethylenimine  <cit> . twenty-four hours after transfection the cells were washed with ice-cold pbs and lysed in  <dig>  ml lysis buffer ) for  <dig> minutes on ice. the lysates were cleared by centrifugation .

for immunoprecipitation of myc or v <dig> tagged proteins, ez red anti-myc or anti-v <dig> affinity beads  were pre-washed with lysis buffer and then incubated with the cleared lysates for  <dig> hours at 4°c with gentle rotation. for immunoprecipitations using antibodies against tsc <dig> or the xpress tag, the antibodies were incubated with the lysates on ice for  <dig> minutes before transfer to pre-washed protein a/g beads and incubation at 4°c for  <dig> hours with gentle rotation. beads were washed at least  <dig> times with >20-fold excess of lysis buffer per wash, recovered between each wash by centrifugation  and resuspended in sample buffer prior to immunoblot analysis.

affinity purification of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex
hek 293t cells in  <dig> cm dishes were cotransfected with the tsc <dig> and tsc1-tev-myc expression constructs. forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were rinsed with cold pbs and lysed in  <dig>  ml of lysis buffer for  <dig> minutes on ice prior to centrifugation . the supernatant was transferred to  <dig> μl of a 50% suspension of ez red anti-myc affinity beads , pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer, and agitated gently for  <dig> hours at 4°c. beads were recovered by centrifugation  and washed  <dig> times with  <dig>  ml lysis buffer. the washed beads were resuspended in  <dig> μl of lysis buffer and incubated overnight at 4°c with 10u of actev . beads were removed by centrifugation  and the supernatant fraction analysed by gel filtration.

RESULTS
gel filtration of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex
previously, we estimated the size of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex by gel filtration of detergent lysates of hela cells  <cit> . tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> co-eluted at an estimated molecular weight >  <dig> kda. more recently, we repeated these gel filtration experiments using detergent-free extracts of human embryonal kidney  293t cells. cells were first lysed in hypotonic buffer to prepare a cytosolic extract. subsequently, the remaining insoluble material was extracted first with buffer containing  <dig> mm nacl and finally in buffer containing  <dig> % w/v triton x <dig>  elution fractions of the extracts were collected and separated by sds-page and probed for the presence of tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> by immunoblotting, as shown in figure  <dig>  for comparison, and to confirm that the lysis and gel filtration procedure gave the expected results for other proteins, we screened the elution fractions for tor, akt, fmrp and 14-3-3ζ. tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> were present in all extracts, similar to tor and 14-3-3ζ. in contrast, akt was predominantly in the cytosolic extract, as expected  <cit> , while most fmrp was detected in the  <dig> mm nacl extract.

tsc <dig>  and tsc <dig>  co-eluted across a broad range of fractions. for both proteins the peak fractions were 20– <dig>  for the cytosolic extract, and 18– <dig>  for the  <dig> mm nacl extract . the elution profiles for tor were slightly different to those for tsc <dig> and tsc <dig>  tor eluted slightly later, with peak fractions 26– <dig>  for the cytosolic extract and 24– <dig>  for the  <dig> mm nacl extract , corresponding quite well with previous estimates of the size of tor complexes   <cit> . akt  and 14-3-3ζ  eluted later, with fractions  <dig> and  <dig>  showing the strongest signals . the elution profile for fmrp had  <dig> distinct peaks, corresponding to fractions 10– <dig>  and 32– <dig> . most likely the fmrp detected in fractions 10– <dig> corresponds to fmrp associated with ribosomes, while the peak corresponding to fractions 32– <dig> represents fmrp homo-multimers  <cit> .

the combined molecular weight of the tsc1-tsc <dig> dimer is  <dig> kda. therefore, the elution profiles suggested that tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> exist as subunits of larger protein complexes, consistent with previous findings  <cit> . tsc <dig> was detected in a broader range of fractions than tsc <dig>  particularly from the cytosolic extract , suggesting that a proportion of the tsc <dig> in the cytosol is not associated with tsc <dig> 

the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex is phosphorylated at multiple sites, including t <dig>  by akt, resulting in inhibition of tsc1-tsc <dig> complex function. it has been proposed that akt-dependent phosphorylation of tsc <dig> and subsequent binding of 14-3- <dig> proteins results in sequestration of tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes in the cytosol  <cit> , and therefore in a distinct compartment from the tsc1-tsc <dig> substrate rheb which is predominantly active on endomembranes  <cit> . consistent with this idea, we only detected t1462-phosphorylated tsc <dig> in fractions from the cytosolic extract . furthermore, although we did not demonstrate a direct interaction between tsc <dig> and 14-3-3ζ, co-elution of tsc <dig> and 14-3-3ζ in fractions 24– <dig> of both extracts  is consistent with tsc2-14-3-3ζ binding  <cit> . the elution profiles of tor, akt, fmrp and 14-3-3ζ were consistent with previous findings and therefore it is unlikely that the apparent large size estimates for the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex in the cytosolic and  <dig> mm nacl extracts were artefacts of the lysis and fractionation procedure.

tor, tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> co-eluted in the early fractions of the triton x <dig> extract . one possibility is that tor and tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes associate with detergent-containing micelles. alternatively, these proteins may form very large , insoluble, membrane-associated complexes. we did not account for the formation of these structures in our original investigation  <cit> , and it is possible that this may partly explain the differences between our previous and current estimates for the molecular weight of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex. nonetheless, in both cases, the estimated molecular weight of the complex is greater than could be accounted for by a 1: <dig> heterodimer, consistent with the presence of multiple tsc <dig> and/or tsc <dig> subunits in the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex. interestingly, the elution profiles of tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> are similar to those described for the rgc1-rgc2/as <dig>  ralgap <dig> and ralgap <dig> gap complexes  <cit> . in each case, the active gap complex consists of two distinct subunits, of which the catalytic subunit has significant homology with the tsc <dig> gap-domain  <cit> . it is possible that such multimeric gap complexes would be more responsive allosteric regulation  <cit> , and therefore more sensitive to changes in upstream signalling events.

next, we determined the elution profile of affinity purified tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes. coomassie staining of the purified complex revealed equal amounts of tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> and no other major protein components , consistent with previous results  <cit> . affinity purified tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> co-eluted , indicating that tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> form high molecular weight complexes in the absence of other protein components. in agreement with a previous report  <cit> , we concluded that these complexes contain multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits, possibly as many as a 4: <dig> heterooctamer . the presence of several co-occuring tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> peaks in the elution profile suggests that tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> can assemble into multiple distinct complexes, containing different numbers of tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits.

coimmunoprecipitation of tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes
to confirm the existence of tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes containing multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits, we coexpressed distinct epitope tagged tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> isoforms and determined the composition of tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes containing these isoforms by immunoprecipitation. immunoprecipitation of tsc2v <dig> with anti-v <dig> antibodies resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of gfptsc <dig>  as well as tsc <dig> . similarly, tsc2v <dig> was coimmunoprecipitated with n-terminal xpress epitope tagged tsc <dig>  and anti-xpress antibodies .

specific missense mutations in the n-terminal region of tsc <dig>  such as the r611q substitution  <cit> , disrupt the tsc1-tsc <dig> interaction. other pathogenic tsc <dig> amino acid substitutions, such as n1620s, most likely inactivate the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex by altering the conformation of the active site in the gap domain without affecting tsc1-tsc <dig> complex formation  <cit> . finally, other pathogenic mutations, such as r905q, clearly affect tsc <dig> function  <cit> , although it is not yet clear how. we investigated whether gfptsc2-tsc2v <dig> coimmunoprecipitation was affected by the co-expression of tsc <dig> or by the introduction of the pathogenic tsc <dig> r611q, r905q or n1620s substitutions. as shown in figure 2c, neither the absence of tsc <dig>  nor the introduction of the r611q, r905q or n1620s mutations affected gfptsc2-tsc2v <dig> coimmunoprecipitation. therefore, we concluded that tsc <dig> is not required for the tsc2-tsc <dig> interaction and that this interaction is direct and not affected by the r611q, r905q or n1620s mutations.

over-expression of tsc <dig> in the absence of co-expressed tsc <dig> results in the formation of large, insoluble aggregates of tsc <dig>  co-expression of tsc <dig> prevents tsc <dig> aggregation due to the formation of soluble tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes  <cit> . to determine whether these soluble tsc1-tsc <dig> complexes contain multiple tsc <dig> molecules, we coexpressed tsc <dig> tagged with a c-terminal v <dig> epitope  and tsc <dig> tagged with a c-terminal myc epitope  with tsc <dig>  immunoprecipitation of tsc1v <dig> resulted in coimmunoprecipitation of tsc1myc and tsc <dig>  and tsc1v <dig> and tsc <dig> were coimmunoprecipitated with tsc1myc .

the n- and c- terminal regions of tsc <dig> are involved in the tsc2-tsc <dig> interaction
to investigate the tsc1-tsc <dig> and tsc2-tsc <dig> interactions in more detail, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a series of truncated tsc <dig> proteins. consistent with previous findings  <cit> , we found that the n-terminal region of tsc <dig> was required for binding tsc <dig> . tsc1myc was coimmunoprecipitated with truncation proteins consisting of tsc <dig> amino acids 1– <dig> , 1– <dig>  or 1– <dig>  but not with truncation proteins consisting of tsc <dig> amino acids 1028– <dig>  or 1453– <dig> . in contrast, tsc <dig> was coimmunoprecipitated by all the tsc <dig> truncation proteins tested . furthermore, the a1153v <dig> truncation coimmunoprecipitated with the m1028v <dig> and m1453v <dig> truncations, indicating that the n-terminal and c-terminal regions of tsc <dig> are both involved in tsc2-tsc <dig> binding.

CONCLUSIONS
we performed gel filtration and coimmunoprecipitation experiments to investigate the quaternary structure of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex. although we could not confirm our previous estimate of the size of the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex, our new data support the proposal that the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex can contain multiple tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> subunits  <cit> . classical enzyme kinetic models indicate that multimeric complexes can be very sensitive to the effects of allosteric interactions, and therefore better regulators  <cit> . a multimeric tsc1-tsc <dig> complex would potentially be more responsive to changes in upstream signalling events than the single heterodimer.

our data indicate that the n- and c-terminal regions of tsc <dig> are involved in the tsc2-tsc <dig> interaction, and that tsc <dig> is not required for tsc2-tsc <dig> binding. further studies will be required to elucidate the exact nature of the inter-molecular interactions that stabilise the tsc1-tsc <dig> complex, and to determine whether oligomerisation of the tsc1-tsc <dig> heterodimer is important for the regulation of torc <dig> signalling in normal and disease states. in particular it will be interesting to determine whether specific, pathogenic tsc <dig> and tsc <dig> amino acid substitutions affect tsc1-tsc <dig> oligomerisation.
