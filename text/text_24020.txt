BACKGROUND
trees can change their growth orientation in response to various environmental stresses   <cit> , and during this process reaction wood with modified characteristics and properties is formed. in gymnosperms, compression wood  is produced on the lower side of inclined  trunks or naturally growing branches  <cit> . this reaction wood helps conifer trees maintain stem straightness and branches at certain angles. characterization of cw formed in bent trunks has been extensively investigated in many conifer species . compared to its opposite wood  formed on the upper side of branches and bent trunks, cw has shorter tracheids, larger microfibril angle , greater shrinkage, higher density, lower stiffness, more lignin and less cellulose . thus, it is considered undesirable for both solid wood and pulp products  <cit> .

molecular basis of cw formation has been previously studied in the bent trunks of several conifer species. using the semi-quantitative rt-pcr technique a few cell wall structural protein genes and several lignin-related genes were identified with differential transcription in the bent trunks of loblolly pine  <cit>  and japanese cypress  <cit> , respectively. based on suppression subtractive hybridization  and qrt-pcr, several genes involved in cell wall modification, lignin biosynthesis and transcription regulation had differential transcription in the inclined stems of radiata pine and maritime pine  <cit> . furthermore, genomic approaches such as cdna microarrays revealed differential gene transcription in the bent trunks of loblolly pine  <cit>  and maritime pine  <cit> . these studies have provided valuable insights into the molecular basis of cw formed in bunt trunks of conifers, particularly with regard to its higher lignin content.

to our knowledge all published researches on the properties and gene transcription of reaction wood in conifer species  and angiosperms  were based on the bent trunks under artificial bending or natural inclining forces. it should be noted that these trees had experienced both external forces and gravity stimulus. particularly, the bending force in young trees and seedlings could be much larger than gravity stress. thus, wood properties and gene transcription observed in bent trunks may not accurately reflect gravity stress. in contrast, naturally grown branches are mostly under gravity stress, providing excellent materials for the study of wood formation in response to gravity stimulus. although one previous study with eucalyptus branches identified a few cell wall genes in response to gravity stress in angiosperms  <cit> , wood property variation and the xylem transcriptome changes between the upper and lower sides of branches remains largely unknown in any conifer species.

radiata pine  is the most important conifer species for commercial forestry in australia, new zealand and chile. cw properties of radiata pine have been previously characterized using inclined trees  <cit> . in the present study radiata pine branches were used to study cw formation. firstly, tracheid characteristics and wood properties were measured using the silviscan® technology  <cit> . then, differential gene transcription between the upper  and lower sides of branches  was investigated using radiata pine cdna microarrays. the aim of this study is to reveal insights into the molecular mechanisms of reaction wood formation in conifer branches with a view to plant gravitropism.

RESULTS
characterization of tracheid and wood traits in cw and ow of branches
in the cross-section of the six branch discs, average radius of the lower side xylem  was  <dig>  cm, significantly longer than that of total ow formed on the upper side of branches . the six branch discs had  <dig> growth rings in the cross-section. within a ring formed in a growing circle cw was significant wider than ow  except for the first four rings from pith. these results indicated that gravity stress significantly increased wood formation on the lower side of branches. the larger wood growth in cw could generate compression force to maintain branches at certain orientation.

silviscan measurement of the six branch discs showed significant differences between cw and ow in wood growth, tracheid characteristics and wood properties in terms of average ring values . significant cw and ow variation was also observed in ring  <dig> , which represented developing xylem tissues sampled for the two microarray experiments. in both comparisons cw had greater growth, thicker tracheid walls, larger mfa, greater coarseness, lower specific surface, higher density and lower stiffness compared to ow. interestingly, mfa was drastically altered during cw formation. average mfa in cw  of branches was  <dig>  degrees, significantly larger than that of ow . surprisingly, diameters of cw tracheids were similar to that of ow in both radial and tangential directions, respectively . thus, gravity stress appeared to have little influence on tracheid dimensions in the two directions. moreover, radial dimension of cw and ow tracheids  was slightly larger than their tangential dimension , resulting in nearly round or square shapes of tracheids in the cross-section.figure  <dig> 
variation in tracheid characteristics and wood properties between compression  and opposite wood  of branches. ring width, tracheid wall thickness, radial diameter, tangential diameter, coarseness, specific surface, microfibril angle , wood density and stiffness  were measured in six wood strips of radiata pine branches using silviscan  <dig>  average ring values of each trait were compared between the lower side  and upper side  of the six branches. tracheid and wood traits in ring  <dig> representing developing xylem tissues collected for microarray experiments were also compared between cw and ow. error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean value of each trait. cw and ow variation is statistically significant  except for the two tracheid diameters.



transcriptome comparison between cw and ow formed in branches
the xylem transcriptomes of cw and ow sampled in spring  and autumn  were compared respectively using radiata pine cdna microarrays. in the first comparison between cw and ow sampled in spring,  <dig> out of  <dig>  xylem unigenes  on the microarrays had differential transcription, including  <dig> and  <dig> unigenes preferentially transcribed in cw and ow, respectively . using samples collected in autumn slightly more unigenes  were identified with differential transcription  . thus, different growing seasons may only have little impact on the proportion of the xylem transcriptomes differentially transcribed in cw and ow of radiata pine branches. however, genes up-regulated in cw in spring  were five times more than that in ow ; while in autumn genes preferentially transcribed in cw were slightly more than that in ow. nearly half of the identified genes  had similar transcription patterns in the two seasons during reaction wood formation .figure  <dig> 
transcriptome comparisons between compression  and opposite wood formed in branches. genes differentially transcribed in cw and ow sampled in spring and autumn were identified using radiata pine cdna microarrays, respectively. numbers of preferentially transcribed genes identified from developing xylem sampled in spring  and autumn  were present. differentially transcribed genes were further compared between the two seasons. a number of genes showed consistently differential transcription in the two wood tissues across the two seasons .



the two microarray experiments identified a total of  <dig>  and  <dig> genes differentially transcribed in cw and ow, respectively . almost all these genes  had close matches in the uniprot known proteins and tigr gene indices databases . however, about 35% of the matches did not have a clear function. this is because cw and ow formation has been poorly characterized at the molecular level. of  <dig>  genes identified in cw,  <dig> genes were annotated with gene ontology  terms, and majority  showed molecular functions,  <dig> % had roles in biological processes and less than half  might be cellular components. similarly, in the  <dig> genes preferentially transcribed in ow  <dig> transcripts were annotated with go terms, including molecular functions , biological process  and cellular components .

microarray results of seven selected genes with differential transcription in cw and ow sampled in autumn were validated using the rt-mlpa method. the magnitudes of differential gene transcription measured by rt-mlpa had no significant differences compared to that in the microarray experiment  . this result indicated that the microarray experiments conducted in this study were sufficiently reliable for the identification of genes differentially transcribed in lower and upper sides of radiata pine branches under gravity stress.figure  <dig> 
validation of microarray transcription of selected differentially transcribed genes. a total of seven differentially transcribed genes were selected in the validation using reverse transcriptase-multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification . these genes include four genes up-regulated in cw: cellulose synthase  <dig> , prcesa <dig>  cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase  and plastocyanin-like ; three genes more highly transcribed in ow: peroxidase , e <dig> ubiquitin protein ligase  and retinoblastoma-like protein . developing xylem  sampled in autumn for the microarray experiment was used in the validation, including three biological and four technical replicates. mean log- <dig> ratios  of the  <dig> replicates were calculated for the selected genes and compared with their microarray transcription results. the mean log- <dig> ratio values >  <dig> and <  <dig> indicate genes preferentially transcribed in cw and ow, respectively. error bars represent the standard deviation of the mean log- <dig> ratio.



differential transcription of cytoskeleton-related genes
from a total of  <dig>  genes with differential transcription identified in this study,  <dig> genes were involved in actin filaments and microtubules . in the development of actin filaments, genes encoding different actins, actin bundling proteins and actin related proteins were preferentially transcribed in either cw or ow. however, actin depolymerizing factor  and adf-like genes were exclusively up-regulated in cw of branches. in the microtubule development, different members of the same gene families encoding tubulin folding cofactors, microtubule-associated proteins  and map kinases were differentially transcribed in cw and ow, respectively. interestingly, seven tubulins  were exclusively up-regulated in cw sampled in the two seasons  or a single season .table  <dig>

differential transcription of cell wall-related genes
genes related to cell wall formation at various developmental stages were identified with differential transcription in cw and ow of radiata pine branches. interestingly, these genes were more frequently up-regulated in cw than in ow . in cell division, four genes  were up-regulated in cw; while only one gene  was preferentially transcribed in ow. in cell expansion, three expansin and extensin genes were up-regulated in cw ; while only one up-regulated in ow . in pectin biosynthesis, three genes  were up-regulated in ow; while only a pectin lyase-like had higher transcription in cw. in primary wall modification, two xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolases  were up-regulated in cw of branches, and a gene encoding ovule/fiber cell elongation proteins was more highly transcribed in ow.table  <dig>

secondary cell wall genes were mostly up-regulated in cw of radiata pine branches . of genes involved in cellulose biosynthesis, cellulose synthases , prcesa-like and sucrose synthases  were preferentially transcribed in cw. four of these genes  were up-regulated in cw sampled in both spring and autumn. in the lignin-related genes, 4-coumarate:coa ligase , cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase , cinnamoyl coa reductase-like , caffeic acid ortho-methyltransferase , phenylalanine ammonia-lyase  <dig> , methionine synthases, s-adenosylmethionine synthetase , s-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase , laccases  and dirigent-like were up-regulated in cw. a wide range of cell wall structural protein genes were up-regulated in cw, such as arabinogalactan proteins , fasciclin-like arabinogalactan proteins , glycine-rich protein, proline-rich protein and so on . in contrast, only three flas  were preferentially transcribed in ow of branches.table  <dig>

hormone and calcium signalling genes differentially transcribed in cw and ow formation
similar to genes involved in cell wall formation, differentially transcribed genes related to hormone and calcium signalling were mostly up-regulated in cw of branches; while only a few of these genes were preferentially transcribed in ow . these hormone signalling genes were related to five major hormones . for example, three auxin-related genes were up-regulated in cw, including auxin-induced protein, auxin-regulated protein  and arp-like. other hormone-related genes up-regulated in cw included genes encoding gibberellins-induced receptor-like kinase, cytokinin-binding protein, ethylene response factor-like, ethylene responsive element binding factor and ethylene-forming enzyme. in addition, six calcium-related genes  were up-regulated in cw of branches in both spring and autumn .table  <dig>

cw and ow formation involves extensive transcription regulation
most hormone signalling genes up-regulated in cw  had functions in transcription regulation. besides, many other transcription factor  genes were also identified with differential transcription in cw and ow . different members of homeodomain, lim and zinc finger gene families were up-regulated in cw and ow, respectively. in contrast, several other tfs were preferentially transcribed in either cw or ow formation. for example, bhlh, btf, hd-zip and myb were exclusively up-regulated in cw; while wrky and transcriptional corepressor were only highly transcribed in ow.

differential gene transcription related to divergent environmental stresses
fifteen genes involved in various environmental stresses  were up-regulated in cw of branches; while only two genes related to environmental stresses were preferentially transcribed in ow . of genes related to water stress, aquaporin, water deficit inducible protein, dehydrin, dehydrin  <dig> and dehydration-responsive protein-like were up-regulated in cw. several genes responding to salt stress  and disease resistance  protein and tir/p-loop/lrr) were exclusively up-regulated in cw formation. surprisingly, light-inducible protein atls <dig>  light-induced protein-like and phytochrome were exclusively up-regulated in cw, suggesting cw formation may be affected by light signals.table  <dig>

discussion
extensive transcriptome remodelling underlies drastic cw and ow variation
drastic variation between cw and ow of radiata pine branches indicated that gravity stimulus affects cell division, secondary wall deposition, cellulose microfibril orientation and overall wood properties. the larger mfa in cw greatly contributes to its lower wood stiffness despite of its higher density. this is because mfa rather than density has a predominant and adverse effect on wood stiffness  <cit> . the greater growth of cw on the lower side branches helps to push the branches up; while the lower mfa and higher stiffness in ow could contribute to pull up branches against gravitational force. since tw formed on the upper side of angiosperm branches also had a drastically declined mfa and larger stiffness  <cit> , this pull-push mechanism appears to be conserved in gymnosperms and angiosperms. cw and ow variation observed in the radiata pine branches were mostly in agreement with previous data derived from bent trunks of conifer species  <cit> . although gravity stress has little impact on tracheid wall expansion in radial and tangential directions , it does affect longitudinal growth of tracheids as cw has longer tracheids than ow  <cit> .

differential gene transcription could provide molecular evidence for the drastic variation between cw and ow. the xylem transcriptome changes in cw and ow of radiata pine branches  are among the highest in a number of microarray comparisons with regard to radiata pine wood development, including earlywood vs. latewood   <cit> , juvenile wood vs. mature wood   <cit> , high stiffness vs. low stiffness wood   <cit> , high density vs. low density wood   <cit> . genes differentially transcribed in cw and ow had various functions in cell division, cell expansion, primary wall synthesis, secondary wall deposition, hormone and calcium signallings, transcription and environmental stresses. the extensive transcriptome remodelling and divergent functions of differentially transcribed genes could underlie drastic cw and ow variation observed in radiata pine branches. genes involved in cell wall formation, hormone and calcium signallings, and various environmental stresses were mostly up-regulated in cw. thus, cw experienced more transcriptome remodelling than ow, resulting in greater phenotypic variation between cw and wood formed in normal conditions  compared to that between ow and nw  <cit> .

cytoskeleton-related genes affect cellulose microfibril orientation
the cytoskeleton is made up of microtubules, actin filaments, and intermediate filaments  <cit> . there is growing evidence that cortical microtubules play a key role during the crystallization of cellulose microfibrils  <cit>  by directing their orientation in the wall  <cit> . up-regulation of alpha- and beta-tubulins in cw  of radiata pine branches is in agreement with previous study using bent trunks of maritime pine  <cit> . association of allelic variation in an alpha-tubulin with mfa was observed in secondary xylem of loblolly pine  <cit> . in angiosperms, several alpha- and beta-tubulins were highly transcribed in tw  formed in bent poplar trunks  <cit>  and eucalypt branches  <cit> . over-transcription of an eucalypt beta-tubulin gene in transgenic xylem directly influenced mfa  <cit> . taken together, the functions of tubulin genes involved in cellulose microfibril orientation of secondary xylem have been conserved in both gymnosperms and angiosperms.

actin filaments are much less rigid compared to microtubules  <cit> . interaction of actin filaments with cortical microtubules altered the orientation of cellulose microfibrils in cultured cotton fiber cells  <cit> . our study identified two adfs  that were exclusively up-regulated in cw of branches. adf plays an important role in regulating the optimum balance between unpolymerised actin molecules and assembled actin filaments  <cit> . genes involved in actin filaments showed different transcription patterns in reaction wood between branches  and bent trunks  <cit>  in conifers. for example, actin polymerizing factors up-regulated in cw of bent trunks in spring were not identified in cw of branches in either spring or autumn, suggesting their responses exclusive to bending forces rather than gravity stimulus. in contrast, genes  with differential transcription in branches were not identified in bent trunks, highlighting their possible roles in response to gravity stress.

secondary cell wall genes confer tracheid wall thickness and wood density
this study identified many secondary cell wall genes with preferential transcription in cw of radiata pine branches . three prcesa genes  up-regulated in cw were previously clustered as secondary wall genes and prcesa <dig> preferentially transcribed in ow is a primary wall gene  <cit> . several cesas were also up-regulated in cw of bent maritime pine  <cit> , tw of bent eucalypts  <cit>  and poplars  <cit> . besides, cesa-like and susy genes were up-regulated in cw of both branches  and bent trunks of conifers  <cit> . in scots pine susy activity was observed to peak in the zone of maturing tracheids where the secondary wall is formed, and its transcription was lower in primary wall tissues  <cit> . over-transcription of a susy gene increased cellulose content, secondary wall thickness and wood density in poplars  <cit> .

lignin biosynthesis consists of three major steps: shikimate pathway, monolignol pathway and monolignol polymerization  <cit> . phenylalanine is an end product of the shikimate pathway with seven enzymes involved  <cit> . five of these genes were up-regulated in cw of radiata pine branches, including shikimate kinase  <dig>  chorismate synthase, chorismate mutase, 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase  and 5-enolpyruvylshikimate 3-phosphate synthase  . phenylalanine and other precursors for monolignol biosynthesis are extensively methylated in the s-adenosyl methionine  dependent reaction  <cit> . genes related to sam metabolism  were up-regulated in cw of radiata pine branches. preferential transcription of genes related to shikimate pathway and sam metabolism in cw may result in more production of monolignol precursors. finally, monolignol synthesis could be also enhanced in cw due to up-regulation of several key genes involved in monolignol pathway . most of these lignin-related genes were also up-regulated in cw of bent trunks in maritime pine  <cit>  and tw of bent eucalypts  <cit> . besides, several other lignin-related proteins were highly presented in cw of bent trunks in maritime pine   <cit>  and in japanese cypress at the transcript level   <cit> . in summary, up-regulation of lignin-related genes in cw provided the molecular basis for its higher lignin content and thicker tracheid walls compared to that in ow.

a number of cell wall structural protein genes  were exclusively up-regulated in cw of radiata pine branches. in loblolly pine six ptaagps were predominantly transcribed in secondary xylem development  <cit> . our study revealed that flas were differentially transcribed in either cw  or ow  of radiata pine branches. in angiosperms flas were up-regulated in tw of bent poplar trees  <cit>  and eucalypt branches  <cit> . gene function studies further confirmed that flas affect mfa and tensile stiffness in transgenic eucalypts and arabidopsis by altering cellulose deposition and the integrity of the cell wall matrix  <cit> .

tracheid wall thickness and wood density are determined by secondary cell wall synthesis and deposition. up-regulation of genes related to cellulose and lignin biosynthesis and cell wall structure in cw of radiata pine branches coincided with its drastically increased tracheid walls and wood density. these results were generally in agreement with previous studies in the bent trunks of maritime pine  <cit>  and eucalypts  <cit>  as well as in radiata pine juvenile wood with higher density  <cit> . however, it has been well documented that cw has lower cellulose content  <cit> . this is because lignin synthesis is also greatly increased in cw as suggested in this study and demonstrated elsewhere  <cit> . thus, cw has relatively lower cellulose content.

genes involved in cell division and primary wall modification implicate wood growth and tracheid dimensions
the quantity of wood formation is largely related to cell division and expansion during primary cell wall development. four cell division-related genes were identified with up-regulation in cw of radiata pine branches. rapid cell division in cw could be an earlier response of reaction wood formation in conifer branches under gravity stress. it can partly explain the greater wood growth on the lower side of branches.

tracheids are structures of three dimensions  which are determined in cell expansion during primary wall formation. several expansins and xets were differentially transcribed in cw and ow of radiata pine branches  and bent trunks of maritime pine  <cit> . xets can cut and rejoin xyloglucan  chains, and are believed to be important regulators of primary wall expansion  <cit> . different genes involved in pectin biosynthesis were up-regulated in cw  or ow  of radiata pine branches. differential transcription of these genes in cw and ow could provide molecular evidence for their similar tracheid diameters . on the other hand, a gene encoding ovule/fiber cell elongation protein with up-regulation in ow could suggest its possible function in the longitudinal growth of tracheids.

gravity stress triggers hormone, calcium and other environmental signals
plant gravitropism is a complex process including three major stages: gravity perception, signal transduction, and growth response. in this study many genes related to hormone and calcium signalling as well as environmental stresses were up-regulated in cw of branches; while only a few genes in these categories were preferentially transcribed in ow . these results provided valuable clues for the understanding of reaction wood formation in response to gravity stimulus during earlier perception and signal transduction.

some hormone signalling genes with up-regulation in cw of radiata pine branches  had preferential transcription in cw of inclined pines  <cit>  and tw of bent eucalypts  <cit> . auxin is widely believed to be the primary effector of gravitropism since its asymmetric distribution drives the gravitropic growth  <cit> . gravity stimulus also induces other hormones, such as ethylene  and gibberellins . cytokinin increased secondary xylem formation with higher lignification and thicker cell walls  <cit> . the identified hormone signalling genes  and other tf genes  could provide additional candidates of gravity preceptors or signal transduction.

calcium  signalling has a strong relationship with plant gravitropism  <cit> . it has functions in all steps of the signal transduction pathway by acting as a second messenger to mediate auxin redistribution  <cit> . a calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase from maize showed light-regulated gravitropism  <cit> . calcium has been proven a role in secondary xylem development and cw formation  <cit> . in the present study several calcium signalling genes were consistently up-regulated in cw of branches in both spring and autumn , providing further evidence for calcium signals with roles in reaction wood formation. the identified calcium signalling genes could be important candidates of earlier signals of conifer reaction wood formation in response to gravity stress.

the majority of differentially transcribed genes involved in various environmental stresses  were up-regulated in cw of branches . this is because rapid cw formation requires more resources for cell division, primary wall formation and secondary wall deposition that trigger different environmental stresses. up-regulation of three light signalling genes  in cw of radiata pine branches could be a result of reduced light radiation on the lower side of branches. phytochromes are red and far-red light photoreceptors, and they regulate a large number of genes involved in hormone signalling or enzymes involved in cell wall modification  <cit> . in hypocotyls gravitropism phytochromes inhibited four phytochrome-interacting factors  <cit> . thus, plant gravitropism may be regulated by the interaction between light, hormone and calcium signallings  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
compression wood formed in radiata pine branches showed greater radial growth, thicker tracheid walls, larger microfibril angle , higher density and lower stiffness, but similar tracheid diameters compared to its opposite wood. extensive remodelling of the xylem transcriptomes  observed in compression and opposite wood could provide molecular evidence for their drastic variation in tracheid and wood traits. many genes involved in cell division, cellulose biosynthesis, lignin pathway and microtubules were exclusively up-regulated in compression wood, conferring its greater radial growth, thicker tracheid walls, higher density, larger mfa and lower stiffness. in contrast, genes related to cell expansion and primary wall modification were differentially transcribed in either compression or opposite wood, implicating their similar tracheid diameters but different tracheid lengths. of particular interest, a broad range of genes related to hormone and calcium signalling and various environmental stresses were exclusively up-regulated in compression wood, suggesting possible earlier molecular signatures of plant gravitropism during reaction wood formation in conifers. the first transcriptome profiling of radiate pine branches provides more accurate insights into the molecular basis of reaction wood formation in response to gravity stimulus without external bending forces.
