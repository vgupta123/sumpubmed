BACKGROUND
olfactory receptor  genes were first identified in the rat nasal epithelium by buck and axel in  <dig>  <cit> . the receptors they encode play an essential role in olfaction, constituting a key initial element in a cascade of biochemical reactions that lead to odorant perception and recognition. gene cloning and in silico mining of a number of mammalian genome sequences have identified about  <dig> or intact genes and pseudogenes in the human genome  <cit>  and up to  <dig> or genes  in the rat genome  <cit> . indeed, these genes constitute by far the largest gene family in mammalian genomes.

a substantial percentage of or genes -- 50% in humans  <cit> , 24% in mouse  <cit> ,  <dig> % in dog and  <dig> % in rat  <cit>  -- are pseudogenes. however, the distinction between pseudogenes and potentially active genes is not strictly defined: for example, a particular gene may exist as either a pseudogene or a potentially active gene, depending upon the population or the individual, as shown for dogs  <cit>  and for humans  <cit> .

only a small number of or proteins have been deorphanized, i.e. the ligand that they bind to has been identified, and the role of the vast majority of these proteins in olfaction remains undefined. cloning experiments and microarray analyses have added an additional layer of complexity by showing that at least some pseudogenes can be transcribed  <cit>  and that the transcription of or genes is not necessarily restricted to the nasal mucosa, but is also detected in several other tissues, including testis  <cit>  and kidney  <cit> .

ors are expressed on the surface of the cilia of olfactory sensory neurons  lining the neuroepithelium in the nasal cavity, the site of odorant inhalation  <cit> . each osn expresses one or from a single allele  <cit> ; their axons extend to the olfactory bulb, where the axons of all osn expressing the same or converge on a single glomerulus  <cit> . the mechanism by which axons of osns expressing the same or, but dispersed along the olfactory epithelium, converge on the same glomerulus is not totally understood. however, ors that are not restricted to osn cilia, but which are also present at the tip of the axons  <cit>  contribute, together with other proteins, to the coalescence of the axons  <cit> .

studies based on cdna library analysis and microarray hybridization have shown that only a subset of the mouse or gene repertoire is expressed at detectable levels in the olfactory epithelium  <cit> . in humans, the pattern of transcription differs slightly between individuals  <cit> . the importance of such differences is not known. in particular, it is unclear whether these differences reflect individual differences in sensory function, possibly related to some form of anosmia or hyperosmia, or whether they reflect environmental differences. in this study, we carried out hybridization on whole rat genome microarrays, to analyze the transcriptome of the olfactory epithelium of adult brown norway rats of different origins and sex. the transcriptomes of these rats were then compared with those of newborn and aged rats, to investigate changes associated with aging.

RESULTS
i - the olfactory epithelium transcriptome of adult brown norway rats
we determined the gene expression profiles of olfactory epithelia from six-week-old rats not exposed to a particular odorant . we purchased four brown norway rats  from elevage janvier and four rats of the same strain  from charles river laboratories. after their arrival, the animals were kept in the animal house for one week and were then killed. total rna was extracted from left and right olfactory epithelia, labeled and used for hybridization on agilent whole rat genome 44k microarrays, as described in the methods section. microarrays were scanned and probes were assigned to three groups: "expressed", "weakly expressed" and "not expressed" .

of all the probes spotted on the array,  <dig>   gave a signal above background for at least  <dig> of the  <dig> samples  . these probes were considered to correspond to the set of genes expressed to detectable levels. they included  <dig> of the  <dig> or genes spotted on the array .

for probes that did not give either a positive or negative signal  for all samples, we compared the signal status of each probe  in the right and left samples from each rat. we observed two different scenarios for the  <dig> samples : identical responses in the left and right samples, and different responses for the left and right samples. for  <dig> probes, we observed a 12+/2- distribution ; for  <dig> of these  <dig> probes, the two negative results were obtained for left and right samples from the same rat. similarly, a 12-/2+ distribution of negative and positive signal was observed for  <dig> probes;  <dig> of these probes yielded two positive results for the left and right samples from a single rat. statistical analysis  of the data clearly demonstrated that both negative and positive results were more frequently paired  than would be expected if the distribution were random. probes giving different results for different samples presumably corresponded to two groups of transcripts: one corresponding to a group of genes poorly expressed at levels close to the detection limit of the method used, generating a random distribution of negative and positive results; and a second group corresponding to genes giving the same results for the right and left samples of an individual , and thus clearly expressed by some animals and not expressed by others.

as discussed in more detail below, the set of probes corresponding to weakly expressed or not expressed genes in these experiments depends on the sensitivity of the detection method used. nevertheless, the proportion of or genes considered to be expressed at detectable levels in this study is consistent with previous suggestions that up to 76% of or genes are expressed at a detectable level in the human olfactory epithelium  <cit> .

• statistical analysis 
we performed a statistical analysis  to identify genes that were differentially expressed between animals from two different suppliers and between males and females.

only  <dig> genes, none of which encoded an or gene, were differentially expressed between rats of the two different origins. these genes were distributed over seven different autosomal chromosomes plus the "unknown" chromosome  <cit>  . six of these  <dig> genes were more strongly expressed, with levels twice as high, in the charles river rats than the elevage janvier rats. the other four of these genes were expressed more strongly in rats from elevage janvier. one gene, per <dig>  was identified twice by two independent probes, validating this finding. per <dig> and dbp, also identified among these ten genes, are both involved in circadian rhythm  <cit> .

genes differentially expressed in the olfactory epithelia of rats obtained from two different suppliers and ranked by fold difference. note that per <dig> was identified twice and that four probes correspond to non-annotated genes.

we then compared gene expression in the olfactory epithelium between males and females. four genes, none of which encode an or gene, were found to be expressed more strongly in female olfactory epithelium . three of these genes are located on the rnox  chromosome, consistent with their stronger expression in females; the fourth gene is located on rno <dig>  the eif2s3x gene  was detected twice, by two independent probes spotted onto the microarrays, again validating the differential expression of this gene. moreover, two of these four genes, eif2s3x and utx, have previously been reported to be overexpressed in female mouse brain  <cit> . in line with these results, studies on adult sprague-dawley rats  <cit>  with affymetrix pangenomic arrays, or on mice  <cit>  with arrays dedicated to or and vomeronasal  genes have shown no detectable difference in or gene expression between sexes.

genes differentially expressed in olfactory epithelia between male and female rats note that eif2s3x was identified twice and one probe corresponds to a non-annotated gene.

we performed hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis for the whole set of expressed gene transcripts and with or genes only . the absence of clear clustering using either of these two approaches, together with only a very small number of genes identified in the t-test analysis, clearly demonstrates that all animals expressed essentially the same genes to similar levels, regardless of their origin and sex.

• real-time reverse-transcription pcr analysis 
microarray hybridization represents an efficient method of comparing rna expression levels between samples. however, as the hybridization efficiency and kinetics differ between pairs of targets and probes, it does not provide a good estimate of the relative abundance of mrna within a sample. to overcome this limitation, we performed rtqpcr with three rna samples to evaluate the expression level of  <dig> or genes selected to represent the entire or gene repertoire. we also included gαolf, the gα subunit of osn  <cit> . a mean difference of  <dig>  ct was observed between the most and least strongly expressed or genes, corresponding to a 100-fold difference in transcript levels . a gradual change in mrna concentration was observed between the highest and lowest amounts of transcript . in a previous study, a difference of up to 300-fold between the least and most strongly expressed mouse or genes was calculated from the frequency at which or mrna clones were obtained  <cit> . we found a mean difference of  <dig>  ct between gαolf and the most strongly expressed or genes . gαolf is expressed by all neurons, whereas a particular or gene is expressed by only a small subset of neurons, estimated to constitute  <dig> % of total osns  <cit> . therefore, an individual neuron, particularly in the case of osns bearing the most strongly expressed or, may contain more or than gαolf mrna. however, more copies of or than gαolf mrna per osn would not be beneficial in terms of efficient signal transduction; rather, the number of gαolf mrna copies may differ between osns, with more gαolf present in osns expressing larger amounts of receptor. we compared these ct values with the microarray results. most of the or genes , marked in green in figure  <dig>  were identified as expressed genes in microarray experiments. three or genes  were identified as not expressed and  <dig>  were found to be weakly expressed. a small number of the oligonucleotide pairs designed for rtqpcr experiments, corresponding to  <dig> additional or genes, failed to amplify their cognate mrna . eight of them were later shown to be not expressed by the microarray analyses. altogether, these findings confirm that a majority of or genes are indeed expressed in the olfactory epithelium, displaying considerable variation in the range of expression levels detected.

the four endoturbinates making up the olfactory epithelium were dissected individually in one adult rat and the corresponding rna samples used for rtqpcr analysis with the same set of primers. we found that these  <dig> or genes were expressed differently between these four endoturbinates, whereas gapdh and gαolf genes were expressed at similar levels . up to  <dig> or genes were more strongly expressed in endoturbinate ii , whereas the other ors were more abundant in one of the other three endoturbinates . we did not find a correlation between or families and expression levels in any one endoturbinate. previous in situ hybridizations with 35s-labeled antisense or rna probes have shown that neurons expressing individual receptors are topographically localized in different radial zones  <cit> . the preferential expression of a number of or genes in a particular endoturbinate, as shown here, demonstrates another level of complexity in the olfactory epithelium structure and extends our understanding based on previous studies using electro-olfactograms  <cit> .

ii - changes in mrna profile with aging
we investigated olfactory epithelium mrna profiles at various ages, from birth to old age. four female rats and their newborn pups  were purchased. newborn rats were too small for independent dissection of the right and left sides of the nasal epithelium. therefore, rna was extracted from one side only for each pup. rna was also extracted from the left and right olfactory epithelium of four  <dig> month-old male rats kept in the animal house from the age of three weeks, and from four nine-week-old male rats. rna samples were labeled, hybridized and the obtained data were analyzed as described above. the numbers of all transcripts and of or genes expressed by animals of the three age groups are given in figure  <dig>  the distribution of expressed, weakly expressed and not expressed transcripts, when all transcripts were taken into account, did not significantly differ between rats of different ages  and  <dig>  for old rats). however, or gene expression profiles in newborn rats differed from the other two age groups, with "expressed or"/"not expressed or" ratios of  <dig>  to  <dig>  for the four different litters of pups, whereas it was  <dig>  for adult  and  <dig>  for old rats .

comparison of the lists of gene transcripts and or gene transcripts only showed that a vast majority of them are common to all three age groups. however, there are some notable differences between newborn and the two other groups:  <dig> or genes were expressed by adults and older animals but not by newborn rats and nine or genes were expressed by all newborn rats only . considering each litter separately, between  <dig> and  <dig> or genes  were identified as expressed in newborns only .

we performed rtqpcr for or genes for which expression was detected only at birth and for which we could design suitable pairs of primers . the results obtained from the four adult rats, four old rats and the  <dig> newborns displayed large standard deviations, in part due to individual variation but also due to the low level of expression typical of or genes. nevertheless, some of these genes tended to be more strongly expressed in pups than in adults or old rats. this effect was particularly marked for olr <dig>  olr <dig> and olr <dig>  we then selected nine of the  <dig> or genes identified as not expressed or very weakly expressed in pups  but as being expressed in adults and older rats. rtqpcr data confirmed that they all had a much lower level of expression in pups than in adults or older rats .

the  <dig>  transcripts and  <dig> or genes expressed by the three age groups were subjected to hierarchical clustering . well defined clusters were obtained for the three age groups, with high bootstrap values. principal component analysis  analysis performed with the same data gave the same result . this complete separation of the clusters corresponding to the three age groups demonstrated clear differences in the expression levels of the genes expressed by all animals between these groups. we also observed a tendency for pups of the same litter to form clusters when all transcripts were taken into account. however, this clustering effect was far from robust  when only or genes were considered.

we then carried out a statistical analysis of these data . this showed that  <dig> % of the gene transcripts were differentially expressed, with at least a five-fold difference in mrna levels between newborns and the two other groups . only  <dig> % of the transcripts showed differential expression between adult and old rats. gene ontology  classification analysis of the genes that were up-regulated in newborn rats showed that most of these genes were related to the "cell cycle" and "neurogenesis", whereas the genes up-regulated in adults and old rats were related to the sensory perception of smell. genes that were less strongly expressed in old rats than in adult rats were classified into go categories associated with "developmental processes", "organ division" and "ossification" . similarly, many or genes  were identified as less strongly expressed in newborns than in animals of the two other groups, but eight or genes were found to be overexpressed at birth. olr <dig> and olr <dig> were particularly strongly expressed in all newborns, with transcript levels between  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than in old rats and between  <dig>  and  <dig>  times higher than in adult rats . the expression levels of another or gene, olr <dig>  were found to be higher in all newborns than in adults and, for three of the four litters, than in old rats . three or genes  were overexpressed in pups from litters l <dig> to l4; one or gene, olr <dig>  was overexpressed in litters l <dig> and l3; and another or gene, olr <dig>  was overexpressed in litter l <dig> only.

list of or genes found to be up-regulated in newborn rats by t-test analysis . fold differences are expressed with respect to adults and old rats. figures in bold pointed to fold differences >  <dig> and "-" mean that the t-test analysis gave no significant p value.

next, we performed rtqpcr for the set of the  <dig> or genes described above, to compare their expression levels at birth, adulthood and in old age in the olfactory epithelium rna samples prepared from nine newborn rats from three different litters, three adult rats and three old rats. box plots  showed that these  <dig> or genes have a range of expression levels much greater in newborns than in older animals, and an expression level generally lower in newborns than in adult and old rats. this may be due to the immaturity of the olfactory system in young animals, consistent with the smaller number of or genes expressed at birth.

of these  <dig> or genes,  <dig>  were underexpressed at birth ,  <dig>  were expressed at similar levels at all ages  and five  were overexpressed at birth . as these five or genes were not expressed in all three age groups, they were not included in the t-test analysis. these genes should be added to the list of or genes that are more strongly expressed at birth.

these findings -- the results of the statistical analysis  identifying eight or genes more strongly expressed in newborn rats than in adults, the results of rtqpcr, showing five genes overexpressed in newborn rats  and those presented in figure  <dig>  -- suggest that a small set of or genes are more strongly expressed in newborn animals, with the vast majority expressed at a lower level in these animals.

CONCLUSIONS
we report patterns of gene expression in the olfactory epithelium of adult brown norway rats. we found that 2/ <dig> of the probes  gave a hybridization signal identifying genes expressed at a detectable level. the corresponding genes included  <dig> or genes . we also showed by clustering analysis of the transcripts expressed in common that the pattern of expression depended on the age of the animal rather than on individual characteristics. the number of genes expressed in the olfactory epithelium, whatever their coding function, was found not to differ significantly from those reported for other tissues  <cit>  or from the number of or genes expressed in the mouse or human olfactory epithelium  <cit> . however, the classification of a gene as expressed or not expressed depends on both the detection threshold and the analytical methods used. different arrays made with different probes may give slightly different results, as some genes not detected with one brand of microarrays may be detected by another brand due to different hybridization conditions or probe characteristics. furthermore high-throughput sequencing, depending upon the sequencing depth, can be expected to extend the list of expressed genes  <cit> . extending the list of weakly expressed or genes is also likely to increase the ratio between the most and least strongly expressed genes.

extending the list of poorly expressed or genes will raise many questions. what is the minimum level at which an or gene must be expressed to induce a signal recognized and processed by the brain? why are some or genes strongly expressed, whereas others are expressed only very weakly, if at all? is this a consequence of the environment or does the panel of expressed or genes represent the minimum required for the recognition of all relevant odorants, including those not yet encountered? in this case, under what circumstances may the transcription of weakly or not expressed or genes be up-regulated? answers to these questions might be obtained by subjecting rats to different olfactory environments.

little difference was found between the olfactory epithelium mrna profiles of individual brown norway adult rats of the same age, sex and origin, allowing a reference transcriptome to be defined. however, the rna profiles of newborn, adult and old rats showed marked differences: both the lists of genes specifically expressed at each age group and the levels of expression of genes expressed in all three age groups differed between the three groups, allowing a clear clustering of the samples as a function of age. although 22-month old rats may not be considered very old, it should be noted that the life expectancy of male brown norway rats is only around  <dig> months  <cit> . the gradual loss of olfactory responses in old age is probably at least in part due to the loss of central brain function  <cit> . however, the small but measurable changes in the mrna profiles of the olfactory epithelium observed in this study between adults and old rats may also contribute to this deterioration. the smaller number of or genes expressed and their lower levels of expression at birth would be consistent with an incomplete development of olfactory function at this age.

the venn diagrams, t-tests and rtqpcr analyses reported here all indicate that a small number of or genes  were more strongly expressed or expressed exclusively in newborn rats from different litters. this number is likely to be an underestimation considering that five of the  <dig> or genes taken at random were overexpressed at birth. the types of ligand they recognize are not known, but given that two- to five-day-old rats are blind and deaf, these or genes may be important for behavior, mother-pup relationship and/or nipple recognition. these findings are consistent with the recent observation that newborn rats react to odorant exposure  <cit> .
