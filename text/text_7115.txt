BACKGROUND
liver malignancies are common cancers worldwide and are responsible for approximately one million deaths each year with most hcc patients having poor prognosis as a result of rapid disease progression. the relative 5-year survival rate is about 15% and can be attributed to an advanced stage of disease at the time of diagnosis, the occurrence of cirrhosis and of other co-morbidites  <cit> . detection of early stages of disease is essential for an improved prognosis and overall survival. however, apart from alpha-fetoprotein  only a few serological markers are available in clinical practice  with afp diagnostics remaining unsatisfactory because of its low sensitivity and the non-specific correlation between the clinical behavior of hcc and afp blood levels. for this reason, new biomarkers are in strong demand  <cit>  and more selective markers, such as soluble interleukin- <dig> receptor levels, are evaluated  <cit> .

importantly, research into the molecular pathogenesis of hcc identified several signalling pathways as deregulated. this inspired the development of molecularly targeted therapies such as the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib that inhibits signalling of c-raf- <dig>  mek, erk, vegfr, pdgfr and other kinases, effectively  <cit> . given that epidermal growth factor is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we were particularly interested in an understanding of the consequences of its targeted over-expression in liver. in our initial study we reported the oncogenomics and pathology of egf induced hepatocarcinogenesis and an identification of molecular circuitries linked to exaggerated egfr signalling  <cit> . furthermore, we investigated the serum proteome of egf-tumour-bearing mice to obtain information on disease-regulated proteins and to search for novel biomarkers at different stages of disease  <cit> . note, a regulatory loop was proposed whereby egf induces transcriptional activation of hdac <dig> by ck2Α/akt activation in liver cancer cells  <cit> . additionally, inhibition of egfr in different animal models by erlotinib was shown to attenuate liver fibrosis and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma  <cit>  thus suggesting new therapeutic intervention strategies in the prevention of hcc. indeed, the egf receptor tyrosin kinase plays a much wider role in the immortalization of different cell types as originally anticipated  <cit> , and is highly expressed in a number of solid tumours and egfr over-expression correlates well with tumour progression, resistance to chemotherapy and poor prognosis.

the present study aimed at an identification of disease regulated proteins to facilitate an improved understanding of its complex signalling networks and to search for cross-talk amongst other pathways while an identification of disease regulated proteins would aid the development of molecularly targeted therapies.

for this purpose, a two-dimensional electrophoresis  and maldi-tof/tof ms strategy was employed to identify disease regulated proteins in an egf transgenic mouse model of hcc. this resulted in an identification of  <dig> statistically significant regulated proteins of which  <dig> are uniquely expressed in liver cancer. importantly,  <dig> out of  <dig> mouse tumour specific proteins were likewise uniquely expressed in human hcc and  <dig> disease regulated proteins identified in egf induced liver cancer were similarly regulated in human hcc, as determined by immunhistochemistry using different antibodies and the information given in the publically available human protein atlas depository. clinical significance of the identified proteins could be demonstrated and a total of  <dig> so far unkown proteins could now be related to egf induced liver cancer, several of which are likely candidates for the development of molecularly targeted therapies. this includes the nucleoside diphosphate kinase a, bifunctional atp-dependent dihydroxyacetone kinase, phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein <dig>  i.e. an inhibitor of the raf- <dig> kinase as well as aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> proteins, members c <dig> and c <dig>  interleukin  <dig> and the v-crk sarcoma virus ct <dig> oncogene homolog.

finally, to gain insight into the molecular circuitries of egfr induced hepatocarcinogenesis diverse computational approaches were employed. this revealed master regulatory proteins and permitted network constructions of  <dig> disease regulated proteins with protein-protein interactions being confirmed for > 70% of regulated proteins in string analysis. their regulations were also studied by immunohistochemistry in egf transgenic hcc.

we also compared the serum and liver proteomes of hcc bearing mice and found  <dig> proteins to be similarly regulated, thus evidencing leakage of tumour proteins that can be detected in serum. obviously, these are highly interesting biomarker candidates,  <dig> of which were also regulated in human hcc as determined by immunohistochemistry.

methods
animal studies
all animal work followed strictly the public health service  policy on humane care and use of laboratory animals of the national institutes of health, usa. formal approval to carry out animal studies was granted by the animal welfare ethics committee of the state of lower saxony, germany ). the approval id is az:  <dig> -42502-04-06/ <dig> 

a total of n =  <dig> c57/bl <dig> non-transgenic and n =  <dig> egf transgenic mice , weighing 25–33 g, were housed in makrolon® type iii cages. water and food  was given ad libitum. the temperature and relative humidity was set to 22 ± 2°c and 40–70%, respectively and a 12-h day and night cycle was used.

materials and reagents
tris, urea, thiourea, chaps, dithiothreitol, bromophenol blue, glycerin, sodium dodecyl sulfate, glycine, temed, ammoniumperoxodisulfate, ammonium sulfate, ammonium bicarbonate, colloidal coomassie blue, and acrylamide were purchased from roth . iodacetamide was obtained from serva  and benzonase was purchased from novagen . ampholytes  were purchased from bio-rad laboratories  and destreak was obtained from amersham bioscience .

mouse liver sample preparation
mice were anesthetized with ketamine 10% 100 μl/100 g and xylazine 2% 50 μl/100 g, and after surgical removal the liver was perfused and rinsed with ice cold ringer solution until free of blood.

approximately  <dig>  g of the liver sample was ground in a mortar under liquid nitrogen flow. then, the samples were processed with  <dig>  ml of a buffer containing 40 mm tris base, 7 m urea, 4% chaps, 100 mm dtt, and  <dig> %  biolyte 3– <dig> first . the suspensions were homogenized by sonication  and after addition of 3 μl of benzonase  were left at room temperature for 20 min. the samples were then centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 20 min. the pellets were washed and sonicated for 5 min with a further  <dig>  ml of lb <dig> and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for another 20 min, and the resulting two fractions of supernatant were collected . finally, the pellets were redissolved with  <dig>  ml of buffer containing 40 mm tris base, 5 m urea, 2 m thiourea, 4% chaps, 100 mm dtt, and  <dig> %  biolyte 3– <dig> , sonicated, and centrifuged at  <dig>  g for 20 min. the pellet was collected, and the supernatant was marked as extract b.

from the same animals, a further  <dig> -g portion was ground in a mortar, but was now treated with  <dig>  ml of lb <dig>  the suspensions were sonicated, incubated with benzonase, and centrifuged. the pellets were then washed with another  <dig>  ml of lb <dig>  sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatants were collected .

proteome mapping was done under a variety of conditions, e.g. extraction with lysis buffers  <dig> and  <dig>  in addition, proteins were separated at two different ph ranges  <cit> . a total of  <dig> independent experiments were carried out, and duplicate measurements were run for each experiment. the protein concentration of all extracts was determined using the bradford assay.

liquid-phase ief pre-fractionation
liquid-phase ief pre-fractionation was performed in the rotofor cell system  following the supplier’s instructions. ion exchange membranes were equilibrated overnight in the appropriate electrolyte . after four runs ion exchange membranes were always discarded and new membranes were replaced for the other samples. for each run, the electrode chambers were filled with appropriate fresh electrolytes . initially, the cell was filled with pure water and run for 5 min at  <dig> watts constant power to remove residual ionic contaminants from the membrane core and ion exchange membranes. approximately 32 ml of lb <dig> were used to fill the cell. a total of 60 mg of total proteins in approximately 2 ml of lb <dig> were added to the cell to reach the maximum loadable volume . focusing started at  <dig> watts constant power. after approximately 4 hours the voltage increased to 3000 v and the wattage decreased to 3 w. the focused proteins were harvested in 20 ~  <dig>  ml fractions, and ph values were checked. fractions having ph values between  <dig> and  <dig>  were collected and denoted “a-a” . fractions having ph values >  <dig>  were collected and denoted “a-b” . again, the protein concentration was determined for both fractions  by the bradford method. approximately 30 mg of protein were recovered at the end of the liquid-phase ief pre-fractionation from an initial 60-mg load. the losses are accounted for by the multi-step pre-fractionation procedure, but are not the result of a precipitate that could not be dissolved in our lysis buffer. after each run the membrane core was cleaned with naoh  <dig>  m overnight and sonicated for 5 min in water before the new focusing.

two-dimensional gel electrophoresis
isoelectric focusing  - first dimension
ief was performed using precast linear ipg strips. the 17-cm ipg strips 7– <dig> and 5– <dig> were loaded with  <dig>  mg of proteins by active rehydration . samples destined to be separated by ipg strips 7– <dig> received an excess of hydroxyethyldisulphide   prior to the focusing run. focusing began at 250 v for 20 min in rapid mode,  <dig>  v for 5 h in linear mode and  <dig>  v for  <dig>  vh in rapid mode . ief for the strips 7– <dig> was carried out at 250 v for 60 min in rapid mode,  <dig>  v for 3 h in linear mode and  <dig>  v for  <dig>  vh in rapid mode. each sample was analysed in duplicate. control and hcc samples were run always at the same time .

2-de - second dimension
after ief, the ipg strips were either stored at −80°c or transferred to 10 ml of equilibration buffer  with 2% w/v dtt and  <dig> % v/v bromophenol blue solution  and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. strips were removed and incubated in equilibration buffer with 4% w/v iodoacetamide and  <dig> % v/v bromophenol blue solution for further 20 min at room temperature. finally, the strips and 10 μl sds-page molecular weight standard on filter paper were placed on top of the 20 cm x  <dig>  cm 12% second-dimension gel . both were fixed in place with a  <dig> % w/v agarose overlay. gels were run in protean plus dodeca cell  at 70 v for approximately 14 h, followed by 200 v until the bromophenol blue dye reached the bottom of the gel. the running buffer  was cooled externally to 16°c.

gels/proteins were fixed overnight in 30% ethanol, 2% phosphoric acid, and washed  <dig> x 20 min with 2% phosphoric acid. the gels were equilibrated with 15% ammoniumsulfate, 18% ethanol, 2% phosphoric acid for 15 min and finally stained with colloidal coomassie blue for 48 h.

gel scanning and image analysis
after staining, gels were washed 10 min with pure water and scanned on a molecular fx scanner  at 100 μm resolution. protein spots were imaged first automatically and then manually and analysed using the pdquest™ software . the normalization was carried out in total density in gel mode according to the manufacturer’s recommendation.

matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry 
gels were excised using the spot cutter of bio-rad and placed into 96-well microtiter plates. excised gel spots were washed manually with 20 μl of water for 10 min and destained twice, first with 15 μl ammonium bicarbonate 50 mm for 5 min and then with 15 μl 50% ammonium bicarbonate 50 mm – 50% acetonitrile for 5 min. finally, the gel particles were covered by acetonitrile until gel pieces shrunk and left to dry for 10 min. all gels/proteins were digested manually in situ with 4 μl of ammonium bicarbonate 50 mm containing 20 ng trypsin . after 15 min each gel piece was re-swelled with 10 μl of ammonium bicarbonate 50 mm and incubated for 4 h at 37°c. after 4 h the reaction was stopped by adding 10 μl of trifluoroacetic acid 1% containing  <dig> %  n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside  . for the application of the samples, 4 μl of peptide solution were loaded onto an mtp anchor chip target 600/ <dig>  previously prepared with a saturated solution of matrix, alpha-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid  .

maldi-ms was performed on an ultraflex ii maldi-tof/tof  mass spectrometer equipped with a smartbeam™ laser and a lift-ms/ms facility. the instrument was operated in positive ion reflectron mode and an acceleration voltage of 25 kev for the peptide mass fingerprint  mode. typically,  <dig> spectra, acquired at  <dig> hz, were summed and externally calibrated. in the case of ms/ms-cid the lift device was used for selection and fragmentation of the ions; the acceleration voltage in the ion source 8 kv, the timed ion selector was set to  <dig> % , and argon was used as collision gas . resulting fragments were further accelerated in a second source by 19 kv and analysed by a two-stage gridless reflectron. typically,  <dig> shots were accumulated for the parent ion signal and  <dig> shots for the fragments. flexcontrol™  <dig> , and flexanalysis™  <dig>  were used as instrument control and processing software .

a calibration standard was used for the external calibration of spectra . typically, 1 μl of the peptide calibration standard was spotted on  <dig> calibration positions of the anchor chip target  containing the following peptides: angiotensin ii , angiotensin i , substance p , bombesin , acth clip 1– <dig> , acth clip 18– <dig> , somatostatin  <dig>  and ogp  <dig> % .

internal calibration was achieved using trypsin autolysis products  resulting in a mass accuracy of ≤ 50 ppm. spectra were collected by the flexcontrol software without smoothing or baseline subtraction and a peak resolution higher than  <dig> or 7000 a.u. in case of dhb and chca matrix-sample preparation, respectively. the spectra were sent to the flexanalysis software which labeled the peaks for protein identification by proteinscape  <dig>  or biotools  <dig>  .

trypsin autolysis products, tryptic peptides of human keratin and matrix ions were automatically discarded by proteinscape . proteinscape score booster feature was used to improve database search results by automatic iterative recalibrations and background eliminations. protein scores greater than  <dig> were considered significant  and an annotation as mouse protein as the top candidates was requested in the search when no restriction was applied to the species of origin. identified proteins were checked individually for further considerations.

for pmf peak picking the snap peak detection algorithm, a signal to noise threshold of  <dig>  maximal number of peaks  <dig>  a quality factor threshold  <dig> and baseline subtraction tophat was applied. peptide masses were searched against the swiss-prot database  employing the mascot server , taking into account carbamidomethyl of cysteines -carbamidomethyl - as fixed modification and possible oxidation of methionine -oxidation - as a variable modification but allowing one missed cleavage. based on initial data, ion precursors were selected by proteinscape for tandem ms data acquisition . in the mascot ms/ms ions search, the restriction mammalia was applied with peptide tolerance of . the acceptance criteria for pmf-based identification were an individual ions score > <dig>  at least five matching peptides and 10% peptide coverage of the theoretical sequences.

immunohistochemistry
livers, dissected from egf-overexpressing mice aged between 7– <dig> months, were fixed in 4% buffered paraformaldehyd and embedded in paraffin. 5 μm thick sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated through a descending alcohol series followed by a 4 min washing step in destilled h2o. subsequently, antigen retrieval was performed in citrate buffer  by autoclaving the sections 15 min at 121°c. the envision kit  was used for immunohistochemistry.

the slides were rinsed with destilled h2o and after a 5 min incubation step in tris-buffered saline , endogenous peroxidase activity was blocked with dako peroxidase blocking reagent for 5 min followed by a second washing step. thereafter, the sections were blocked for 10 min with protein-block serum free  and incubated with primary antibodies for 45 min. details of antibody dilutions with washing buffer are given in additional file 1: table s <dig>  in the case of goat primary antibodies a rabbit-anti-goat bridging antibody  was employed. specifically, the bound primary antibodies or bridging antibodies were detected by use of labelled polymer hrp anti-rabbit secondary antibody  and the immunoreactivity was visualized by dako liquid dab substrate chromogen system in a 5 min incubation.

finally, the sections were counterstained with harris haematoxylin for 2 min, dehydrated in an ascending alcohol series, coverslipped and examined under a light microscope .

bioinformatic analysis
a total of n =  <dig> disease regulated proteins were filtered for statistical significance at p <  <dig>  . this yielded n =  <dig> statistically significantly regulated proteins two of which had identical accession number, i.e. aah81431 = atp synthase h+ transporting mitochondrial f <dig> complex, subunit d and bac36241 = apoa <dig> but differed in their spot ids as a result of posttranslational modifications. the statistically significantly regulated proteins were grouped into four different categories to yield  <dig> tumour specific ,  <dig> up-regulated ,  <dig> down-regulated  and  <dig> proteins only expressed in healthy non-transgenic control livers .table  <dig>

categorization of tumour regulated proteins based on ontology terms
 <dig> non-redundant tumour proteins covering to, ur and dr categories were considered and analysed for ontologies using the genexplain software , the biological pathways tools reactome  and kegg  and wikipathways . the tumour regulated proteins  were subjected to functional classification based on ontology terms and a p-value of < <dig>  was considered to be significant. moreover, disease regulated proteins were analysed with the cytoscape software version  <dig> . <dig> using the function go-tree levels and number or % of proteins for a given term .

identification of master regulatory molecules and protein network construction for tumour proteins
master regulatory proteins were searched based on the designated workflow of the genexplain software. it is designed to find master regulatory molecules upstream of an input list of regulated tumour proteins. after annotation of the input datasets the tool for master regulator finding over geneways network  was applied. specifically, the geneways software is used to automatically extract, analyse, visualise and integrate molecular pathway data from the published peer reviewed literature. it is based on document sorting, term identification, term meaning disambiguation, information extraction, ontology, visualization and system integration  <cit> . the following filtering threshold was used, i.e. score cutoff , search collection , maximum radius  <cit> , fdr cutoff , z-score cutoff , penalty  and decay factor  .

protein network for disease regulated proteins were also constructed using the string software . the underlying database informs on known and predicted protein-protein interaction and the constructed networks are based on active prediction methods of neighborhood, gene fusion, co-occurrence, co-expression, databases and textmining. eventually, confidence scores were calculated for each interaction pair and only those above default cutoff scores  were selected.

finally, mapping of pathways information from reactome, kegg and wikipathways have been implemented over protein networks using information of known pathways and sustained proteins connecting these pathways in a given network.

RESULTS
the histopathology and oncogenomics of egf induced liver cancers was previously reported  <cit>  and an important finding of the study was the 100% incidence of malignant tumour formation in less than one year after birth. notably, a sequence of events was observed that initially consisted of diffuse large cell dysplasia followed by multiple dysplastic foci and nodules and growth of hcc. figure  <dig> a and b depict the histopathology of healthy non-transgenic control liver and egf induced tumours, respectively.figure  <dig>

image analysis of differentially expressed proteins
after protein extraction 2de was performed. subsequently, the gels were scanned on a bio-rad molecular fx scanner at a 100 μm resolution. image analysis was done with the pdquesttm software and spots were detected automatically. a total of  <dig> proteins differed in expression or were de novo expressed when 2de gels of non-transgenic controls and hcc mice were compared . among them are  <dig> statistically significantly regulated proteins  of which  <dig> were significantly up-regulated  and included fibrinogen and subunits of it, vimentin, cu/zn superoxide dismutase, and apolipoprotein e , while  <dig> proteins were repressed in expression  and included arginase  <dig>  dhdh protein, glutathione peroxidase  <dig> and agmatine ureohydrolase  and table 1).

identification of proteins by ms analysis
a reference 2-de map of mouse liver and serum proteins was constructed that consists of more than n =  <dig> proteins  <cit> . note, in our previous efforts we identified n =  <dig> serum proteins as regulated in the egf transgenic disease model. among them were alpha-fetoprotein, clusterin, fibrinogen-α and -γ, serum amyloid component p and several apolipoproteins all of which were significantly up-regulated. based on the combined use of 2de and maldi-ms a total of n =  <dig> differentially expressed proteins were identified  and included isoforms as well as post translational modifications of albumin , alpha enolase , apoliproptein a-i , atp synthase h+ transporting mitochondrial , fibrinogen beta , glycine n-methyltransferase , hsp <dig> , nit protein  <dig> , peroxiredoxin  <dig> , and 4931406c07rik  . importantly, a total of n =  <dig> so far unknown disease regulated proteins were identified that can now be related to egf induced liver cancer. these are marked with an asterisk in table  <dig> 

furthermore, a comparison of serum and liver proteoms revealed n =  <dig> proteins to be regulated in common, thus evidencing leakage of tumour proteins into systemic circulation . among them was serum afp; it’s up-regulation and that of others was confirmed by western blot analysis . likewise, apolipoprotein e was up-regulated both in serum and tumour samples, the ratio hcc/control being  <dig>  and  <dig> , respectively. in a previous study on human hcc increased expression of apoe was observed in 88% of study cases; however, gene apoe expression and serum levels were unchanged to suggest its accumulation and impaired secretion  <cit> . two isoforms of alpha-2-macroglobulin were up-regulated in serum of hcc-bearing mice . its expression was exclusively associated with tumours. finally, serum amyloid component p was up to 10-fold up-regulated in serum and its tissue expression was tumour specific .table  <dig>

immunohistochemistry of disease-regulated proteins
to further evidence disease regulated proteins and to provide information on their subcellular localization a total of n =  <dig> proteins were studied by immunohistochemistry. five of them were selected for their novelty  while amphiregulin and epiregulin were chosen for their importance in the egf-signalling pathway. furthermore, hnf4α was studied for its pivotal role in liver cancer  <cit> . depicted in figure  <dig> are immunohistochemistry stainings performed with egf transgenic livers to confirm regulation and predominant cytoplasmic expression of arginase ii. note, arg <dig> is only expressed in hcc and recent evidence suggest modulation of arginine levels in the extracellular milieu to be part of an immune escape mechanism whereby lack of local arginine weakens tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes as t cells require adequate argine levels  <cit> . likewise, the tumour specific and cytoplasmic expression of the f-actin capping protein α <dig> subunit  and the predominant nuclear expression of tubulin β that was particularly visible beneath the liver capsule may possible promote microtubule stability and interactions of microtubules with endogenous proteins. furthermore, the induced and predominat cytoplasmic expression of the gdp dissociation inhibitor  <dig>  protein is part of the control of vesicular trafficking. this protein is known to regulate gdp-gtp exchange amongst members of the rab family of proteins. the tumour specific and cytoplasmic expression of amphiregulin supports the notion of a switch in autocrine signalling and it has been reported that amphiregulin is a prognostic marker for poor outcome of a variety of malignancies including colorectal liver metastasis  <cit> . finally, the repressed nuclear expression of hnf4a was not unexpected and confirms earlier findings  <cit> .figure  <dig>

comparison of disease regulated proteins in mouse and human hcc
based on the information given in table  <dig> the human protein atlas depository  was interrogated. as shown in additional file 4: table s <dig>  <dig> out of  <dig> mouse liver cancer regulated proteins were likewise regulated in human hcc. it should be noted that for some proteins several antibodies were used to study their expression; only representative data were considered. importantly, out of the  <dig> proteins uniquely expressed in mouse liver tumours n =  <dig> were likewise uniquely expressed in human hcc thus evidencing clinical significance of our findings.

comparison of gene and protein expression in egf induced liver cancer
we compared our previously published transcriptomic data of egf induced liver cancers with the proteomic data obtained in the present study. such comparisons revealed n =  <dig> genes to be significantly regulated of which n =  <dig> are in common regulated whereas for n =  <dig> genes transcript expression was opposite to that of the coded proteins .

classifications of disease regulated protein by gene ontology 
 <dig> of the  <dig> significantly regulated proteins were mapped to  <dig> different biological processes  of which prominent examples are regulation of arginine metabolism and amino acid import, regulation of cdc <dig> protein signal transduction’, cellular response to oxidative stress, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, regulation of cholesterol transport, protein-lipid complex and plasma lipoprotein particle remodeling, positive regulation of steroid metabolic process, negative regulation of calcium ion transmembrane transporter activity and release of sequestered calcium ion into cytosol by sarcoplasmic reticulum, .figure  <dig> 
significantly regulated proteins categorized by go terms.  biological process,  cellular components,  molecular functions. the pie-charts depict the percentage of proteins involved in the various go terms.



in figure 4a-c the go biological process, cellular components and molecular functions are depicted.

note, some of the ontology terms could be grouped, i.e. chaperone-mediated protein complex assembly and folding, endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response, er-nucleus signalling pathway and response to er oxidative stress as well as hypoxia, blood coagulation, developmental growth and regulation of programmed cell death.

cellular components and molecular functions
as depicted in figure 4b  <dig> significantly regulated proteins were mapped to  <dig> cellular components , i.e. mitochondrial crista, matrix and inner membrane, endoplasmic reticulum lumen, early endosome and cytoplasmic membrane-bounded vesicle, chylomicron, very-low and high density lipoprotein particle, proteasome accessory complex, peroxisome, extracellular vesicular exosome and extracellular membrane-bounded organelle.

furthermore,  <dig> significantly regulated proteins were mapped to  <dig> molecular functions  and included arginase activity, fructose-bisphosphate aldolase activity, hydrolase and oxidoreductase activity, acting on carbon-nitrogen  bonds, acting on aldehyde, ch-oh group or oxo group of donors, nad or nadp as acceptor as well as steroid dehydrogenase activity. in addition, phosphatidylcholine-sterol o-acyltransferase activator activity, cholesterol transporter activity, sterol transporter, antioxidant and lipid transporter activity as well as electron carrier and serine-type endopeptidase inhibitor activity were prominent functions. finally, proteins functioning in metal ion and purine ribonuleoside triphosphate binding, lipoprotein particle receptor binding, chaperone and oxygen binding, binding of magnesium ion and nad, protease and single-stranded dna binding were observed as disease regulated .

pathway analysis of tumour proteins
in all,  <dig> significantly regulated proteins were classified by the reactome, kegg and wikipathway databases, respectively. the different databases provided similar information with the majority of tumour proteins acting in  <dig> major metabolic pathways . for example, the proteins aldoa, aldoc, fbp <dig> and pkm function in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis whereas akr1c <dig>  aldoa, aldoc and fbp <dig> are part of the fructose and mannose metabolic pathway. likewise, atp5h and ndufv <dig> are part of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway and mdh <dig> and pkm contribute to pyruvate metabolism. similarly, the proteins akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig>  alb, apoa <dig>  apoa <dig>  apoe, fdps, gpx <dig>  hacl <dig> and plg take part in the metabolism of lipids, arachidonic acid and lipoproteins whereas the proteins agmat, arg <dig>  arg <dig>  bckdha, ckb, cps <dig>  haao and phgdh are specified for arginine and proline metabolism. in the same manner the proteins gpx <dig>  itpa and nme <dig> contribute to the metabolism of nucleotides and related to this are the proteins itpa, pkm and psmc <dig> which are part of the purine metabolic pathway. apart from these pathways a highly significant regulation of the blood coagulation cascade, platelet activation and fibrinolysis was observed as defined by the proteins crk, fga, fgb, fgg, plg and sod <dig> all of which were highly significantly regulated. furthermore, trna aminoacylation , advanced glycosylation endproduct receptor signalling , peroxisome , protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum , proteasome  and activation of chaperone genes by xbp <dig> and ‘unfolded protein response’  are pathways significantly perturbed in liver cancer induced by egf .figure  <dig>

using the designated workflow of the genexplain platform  we searched for master regulatory proteins. the software is designed to identify molecules upstream of regulated tumour proteins to assist in the construction of molecular circuitries. after annotation of the input datasets the tool “find master regulators in networks ” was used to identify key nodes amongst  <dig> proteins exclusively expressed in tumours . this revealed  <dig> upstream regulatory molecules. among them five were selected for their link to the egfr signalling pathway, i.e. plaur, fgfr <dig>  ptbp <dig> and agtrap while the protein s100a <dig> was chosen for its importance in the plaur/egfr network, .

in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 12: table s <dig>  the tumour regulated proteins distributed amongst the selected master regulatory molecules are summarized.

in support of its biological significance the constructed networks were enriched with gene expression data from transgenic non-tumour and tumour tissues. thus, the gene and protein data were merged and hybrid networks for each master regulatory protein were constructed. subsequently, these were merged into one  and the integrated hybrid network consisted of n =  <dig> network proteins of which n =  <dig> were tumour specific. in support, the genes coding for lmna, i.e. a component of the nuclear lamina that is frequently up-regulated in cancers and mvp that codes for multidrug resistance were up-regulated  whereas nme, a suppressor of metastasis was repressed in expression . likewise, the genes coding for igals <dig>  i.e. a beta-galactoside-binding protein frequently overexpressed in cancers and pcbp <dig> that is involved in transcription and functions as an inhibitor of invasion  <cit>  were up-regulated in transgenic non-tumour livers  whereas transcript expression of aars, a member of trna synthases and anaxa <dig>  a calcium-dependent, phospholipid-binding protein with important roles in the tumour microenvironment and metastasis were repressed . finally, the entire network was enriched with expression data of  <dig> and  <dig> genes, respectively that were significantly regulated in tumour and non-tumour transgenic livers.figure  <dig> 
integrated master regulatory network for proteins uniquely expressed in tumours. based on network information obtained for the  <dig> different master regulators an integrated hybrid network was constructed. the network contained  <dig> proteins including  <dig> with connectivity to egfr signalling . the master regulator, the connecting proteins  and regulated proteins are given as red, green and blue coloured inner node, respectively. furthermore, each node is partitioned into four segments whereas the first segment seen from left refers to tumour specific proteins and is red-coloured. the second, third and fourth segments refer to either up- and down-regulated proteins, tumour specific gene expression changes and gene regulations in transgenic non-tumour liver tissue, respectively. increased expression of either proteins or genes is given in red, whereas the blue colour denotes repressed expression.



next, we searched for master regulatory molecules by considering  <dig> regulated tumour proteins obtained from the comparison tumour specific or up- and down regulated as compared to healthy non-transgenic controls . this revealed  <dig> filtered  upstream regulators. among these  <dig> were selected as candidates because of their regulation in liver tumours and their link to egfr signalling. notably, in the constructed network all master regulators were significantly up-regulated and included pdia <dig>  apeh, pebp <dig> and apoe while the protein expression of arg <dig>  fbp <dig> and haao was repressed . note, in the case of arg <dig> transcript expression was equally repressed.

in additional file 3: table s <dig> and additional file 12: table s <dig> the tumour regulated proteins distributed amongst the selected master regulatory molecules are summarized.

in support of its biological significance the fused hybrid network was enriched for gene expression data derived from transgenic non-tumour and tumour tissues. thus, the integrated hybrid network consisted of  <dig> out of  <dig> regulated proteins and gene expression calls evidenced  <dig> of the  <dig> up-regulated tumour  proteins to be regulated at the transcript level as well whereas among the  <dig> down-regulated tumour proteins  the gene arg <dig> was repressed in expression. likewise, gene expression data from non-tumour transgenic livers evidenced  <dig> genes out of  <dig> networks partners to be increased in expression  and among the  <dig> down-regulated networks proteins the gene phb was repressed . thus, when the tumour gene expression data of the entire network was considered a total of  <dig> genes were regulated, of which  <dig> were up-regulated and  <dig> were repressed in expression, .figure  <dig>

protein interaction network
based on the information of the hybrid master regulatory network and in addition to other disease regulated proteins summarized in table  <dig>  a total of n =  <dig> disease regulated proteins were considered for network construction. after filtering for non-connected proteins the string database informed on n =  <dig> protein-interactions of which n =  <dig> were disease regulated as identified in the present study. among these  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> were either up-, down- or not statistically significantly regulated. furthermore, gene expression calls for  <dig> up-regulated proteins were supported by  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes identified in tumours and  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes in transgenic non-tumour livers. likewise, gene expression calls for  <dig> down-regulated proteins were supported by  <dig> and  <dig> down-regulated genes in tumours and transgenic non-tumour livers, respectively. therefore, the entire network was supported by  <dig> induced and  <dig> repressed tumour specific gene expression changes and  <dig> up-regulated and  <dig> down-regulated genes observed in transgenic non-tumour livers. as depicted in figure  <dig> the proteins of the fusion network displayed functional associations via the egf/egfr network and included  <dig> out of  <dig>  significantly regulated tumour proteins with  <dig> out of  <dig> master regulators being connected to egfr through the network’s proteins .figure  <dig> 
string protein-protein interaction network. the network consisted of  <dig> statistically significantly up- and down-regulated proteins and  <dig> regulated proteins which failed to reach statistical significance. this string protein-protein network is a confidence view and a required default confidence score of  <dig>  was set. the protein network depicts interaction of regulated proteins including master regulators connected to egfr signalling.



pathways mapping of fussed network proteins
of the  <dig> network proteins  <dig> could be mapped to distinct pathways. after removal of non-relevant terms such as alzheimer disease a total of  <dig> proteins were mapped to  <dig> pathways with meaningful associations  and consisted of ‘platelet activation, signalling and aggregation ’, ‘lipoprotein metabolism’, ‘mapk signalling pathway’, ‘glycolysis and gluconeogenesis’, ‘metabolism of amino acids and derivatives ’, ‘apoptosis’ and ‘egfr <dig> signalling pathway’. additionally, a total of  <dig> and  <dig> tumour regulated proteins were mapped to the hif- <dig> signalling and protein processing in endoplasmic reticulum pathways, respectively. the pathway mapping was also supported by gene expression data with  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes in tumours and  <dig> up- and  <dig> down-regulated genes in transgenic non-tumour livers. note, two of the significantly regulated tumour proteins, i.e. crk and pebp <dig> are members of the egfr <dig> signalling pathway with pebp <dig> also functioning as a master regulator while the other regulated proteins are connected to egfr signalling through cross-talk among the pathways .figure  <dig>

discussion
recent research into the molecular pathogenesis of hcc evidenced significant alterations in signalling pathways. given the fact that the epidermal growth factor is an important mitogen for hepatocytes we were particularly interested in investigating the consequences of its targeted overexpression in the liver. in our previous study we employed chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by cloning and sequencing of dna to search for tumour associated gene regulations targeted by novel hnf4alpha p <dig> and p <dig> promoter-driven isoforms. this identified egf-receptor substrate  and eps <dig> as regulated by the p <dig> promoter-driven hnf4alpha splice variant in mouse and human hcc. a molecular circuitry was proposed whereby eps <dig> and eps15r mediate internalization of activated egfr to stimulate receptor recycling, therefore responding to mitogenic signalling of egf  <cit> . in the present study disease proteomics was performed to further investigate the role of egf in liver cancer. this identified  <dig> regulated proteins of which  <dig> are novel and have not been reported so far.

extra-cellular space and secreted proteins
a total of  <dig> proteins were significantly up-regulated . among these  <dig> were extra-cellular or secreted proteins and included albumin and isoforms of it, apolipoproteins , α-, β-, γ-fibrinogen, plasminogen as well as interleukin  <dig> receptor antagonist . note, an isoform of apoa <dig> was already proposed as serum marker of hcc  <cit>  and based on ihc staining il-1ra expression was confirmed in about 70% of mouse liver adenoma and carcinoma cases; however preneoplastic foci as well as normal hepatocytes surrounding the lesions were negative. furthermore, rt-pcr analysis confirmed mouse hepatic tumours to contain both secreted and intracellular forms of il-1ra  <cit>  and serum levels of il-1ra were monitored to assess therapeutic efficacy of radiofrequency ablation in hcc patients  <cit> .

mitochondrial proteins
an important finding of the present study is the statistically significant regulation of  <dig> mitochondria associated proteins of which  <dig> were repressed while  <dig> were up-regulated. similar results were reported by chignard and wei sun with mitochondrial proteins being the second largest proportion of regulated proteins in human viral hcc  <cit> . among the repressed proteins were nadh dehydrogenase   <dig> alpha subcomplex  <dig> and prohibitin, a mitochondrial chaperone. this protein, when deleted  induced fibrosis, bile duct metaplasia, liver dysplasia and eventually multifocal hcc. however, its overexpression in tumour cell lines inhibited cell proliferation to demonstrate tumour suppressor function  <cit> . likewise, glutathione peroxidase  <dig>  and argininosuccinate synthetase  <dig>  were repressed. note, ass is the first of two enzymes to convert citrulline to arginine and this pathway allows cells to synthesize arginine from citrulline to function in no production, ammonia detoxification and synthesis of polyamines. several reports suggest ass deficiency to be common in tumour cell lines  <cit> , and the present study confirms ass expression to be confined to healthy non-transgenic control liver, but ass was absent in tumour tissue extracts . ablation of ass in diverse tumours suggests a tumour suppressor function and the fact that forced expression of ass in osteosarcoma cell lines suppresses growth adds weight to this notion  <cit> .

another example of tumour specific ablation of proteins refers to glycine n-methyltransferase . the enzyme catalyzes the transfer of a methyl group from s-adenosylmethionine  to glycine thereby generating s-adenosylhomocysteine and n-methylglycine. this protein was completely downregulated in liver tumours. gnmt is known to play a role in the maintenance of genetic stability  <cit> , and a novel tumour suppressor function was recently reported that is independent of its catalytic activity but does require its nuclear localization  <cit> .

newly identified disease-regulated proteins
several of the proteins listed in table  <dig> were already reported for their tumour specific regulation while proteins so far unknown for their regulations in hcc, are marked with an asterisk . these function in diverse biological processes including metabolism, translation and signalling.

specifically, changes in carbohydrate metabolism are commonly observed in tumours where energy production relies on glycolysis rather than mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. in the present study induced expression of several glycolytic enzymes was observed, most notable  <cit>  pyruvate kinase  <dig> that catalyzes the transfer of a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to adp and was shown to be a target of mi-rna <dig> in hcc  <cit>  aldolase, an enzyme that converts fructose  <dig> -bisphosphate into dihydroxyacetone phosphate  and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and was reported to be a sensitive marker for benign and malignant liver disease  <cit>  and  <cit>  alpha glucosidase  <dig>  a hydrolase that cleaves glycosidic bonds with the release of alpha glucose from carbohydrates.

further important findings include the tumour specific expression of alanyl-, glycyl- and seryl-trna synthetases which catalyze the transfer of specific amino acids to trna, as well as regulation of eukaryotic translation elongation factor  <dig> and poly protein  <dig> that binds to oligo dc. note, knowledge on the role of aminoacyl-trna synthetases in cancer is just emerging  <cit>  and through the use of a lentiviral mediated shrna vector, a link between aminoacyl-trna synthetases -interacting multifunctional protein  <dig>  and repressed egfr signalling was established that resulted in repressed glucose uptake  <cit> . we also observed induced expression of heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein  that takes on diverse functions in the processing of mrna. its expression was reported to be increased in serum of hcc patients. in contrast, proteins involved in the synthesis and degradation of cholesterol, lipids, steroids and fatty acid were in part oppositely regulated and included induced expression of the aldo-keto reductase family  <dig>  regulation of this protein has been reported for lung and pancreatic cancers  <cit> , and gene silencing of aldo-keto reductase family  <dig> b <dig> resulted in growth inhibition of colorectal cancer cells that might be of therapeutic utility  <cit> . the repressed expression of certain proteins may also be considered as an adaptive response and includes the enzyme enoyl coenzyme a hydratase  <dig>  its activity was shown to contribute to lymphatic spread of liver tumours as was evidenced in gene silencing studies  <cit> . likewise, we observed repressed expression of dihydrodiol dehydrogenase in tumours. this enzyme plays an important role in the metabolism of steroids that leads to inactivation of circulating androgens, progestins and glucocorticoids and was repeatedly reported to be overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer. amongst patients with high dhd expression the incidence of early tumour recurrence and distant metastasis is significantly higher and patients are highly resistant to chemo and radiotherapy  <cit> .

intriguingly, complete ablation of mitochondrial butyryl coenzyme a synthetase  <dig>  a gtp-dependent lipoate-activating enzyme was observed in tumours of egf transgenic mice. little is known about the possible link between butyrate metabolism and liver cancer. however, butyrate is well known to inhibit proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells in an epigenetic manner that involves histone acetylation  <cit> . note, it was recently reported that due to the warburg effect butyrate-mediated histone acetylation and cell proliferation is dictated  <cit> . several lines of evidence therefore suggest butyrate to act as a cytosolic sensor for histone acteylation and when transformed to intermediates by butyryl coenzyme a synthetase is unable to escape the mitochondria.

moreover, we observed a highly significant repression of 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-coa-lyase. this peroxisomal thiamine pyrophosphate-dependent enzyme is rate limiting in the breakdown of 2-hydroxy fatty acids. the biological role of 2-hydroxy fatty acids has only recently become apparent  <cit>  and cumulative evidence suggests intermediates of energy metabolism to specifically activate g-protein coupled receptors which are now classified as hydroxy carboxylic acid receptors . the hca <dig> receptor is involved in a complex negative feed-back loop whereby ketone bodies derived from fatty acid oxidation are sensed by hca <dig> via the activity of 3-hydroxybutyrate that leads to inhibition of lipolysis and to restriction of further fatty acid supply. in this way triglyceride use is diverted and energy demands for tumour growth are met more efficiently. specifically, during rapid tumour growth and the herewith associated ischemia the yield of high energy bonds  from glucose oxidation is about twice that of fatty acid oxidation. our observation that proteins involved in the ß-oxidation of fatty acids were either repressed or unchanged agrees well with this principle .

the reduced expression of lysophosphopholipase signifies an adaptive response; it catalyses the production of lysophosphatidic acid, i.e. a second messenger known to contribute to tumour cell motility, survival and proliferation  <cit> . additionally, the repressed expression of mitochondrial acyl-coa thioesterase  <dig> in liver tumours which hydrolyzes acyl-coas to free fatty acids and coenzyme a, will influence the supply of ligands for nuclear receptors and the regulation of fatty acid oxidation in mitochondria and peroxisomes. equally, the regulation of farnesyl diphosphate synthetase, i.e. a key enzyme in the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway is highly interesting and this enzyme is explored as a drug target of bisphosphonates to treat tumour growth  <cit> . it’s up-regulation in colon cancers was reported  <cit> . in the present study repressed expression of the ribosom-compononent rps <dig> and enzymes of amino acid metabolism like branched chain ketoacid dehydrogenase e <dig> as well as dimethyl glycine dehydrogease was observed. conversely, expression of the proteasome 26s atpase subunit  <dig>  and its non-atpase regulatory subunit  <dig>  was confined to tumour tissues ; the latter subunit is known to display high activity in embryonic stem cells. this multicomplex molecular machinery degrades intracellular proteins marked up by ubiquitin chains. psmd <dig> was reported to be up-regulated in breast cancer cells  <cit> .

enhanced expression of cytoskeletal proteins such as tubulin β  <dig> and capza <dig> was also confirmed by ihc staining . differences in the localization of these proteins were obvious with tubulin ß  <dig> expression being primarily associated with cells proximal to the liver capsule, whereas expression of capping protein z-line α <dig>  was strongly associated with tumour foci and this protein is known to play a pivotal role in cytoskeletal networks to support cell mobility, invasion and metastasis. additionally, gdi <dig>  a protein functioning in the cycling of rab gtpases and arginase ii, i.e. a non-liver isoform of the urea cycle were up-regulated in tumours of egf transgenic mice . regulation of arginase ii was observed in various malignancies including lung cancer  <cit> . besides, the actin-binding protein lasp <dig> was uniquely expressed in tumours and is also up-regulated in breast cancer  <cit>  to possibly support migration of cancer cells  <cit> . furthermore, pdia <dig>  a disulfide bond isomerase and master regulator of the constructed networks  was up-regulated as was kininogen that is part of the blood coagulation system and functions as a precursor of kinin. conversely, the serinproteinase inhibitor serpinb1a was repressed in expression to possible limited immunological responses in tumour growth and to influence inflammatory cytokine production by infiltrating monocytes  <cit> .

the significant regulation of the calcium binding protein sorcin and nucleobindin  <dig> are further highly interesting results. sorcin is associated with multidrug-resistance in human leukemia cells  <cit>  and nucleobindin  <dig> is evaluated as a biomarker of colon cancer  <cit> . in egf induced liver tumours transthyretin was also up-regulated. this protein is involved in the transport of thyroid hormones and was reported to be aberrantly regulated in thyroid cancer  <cit> . among the newly identified proteins is v-crk sarcoma virus ct <dig>  this oncoprotein interacts with several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins and is part of the intracellular signalling cascades notably the phosphoinositide 3-kinase /akt pathway  <cit> . likewise, regulation of the 170 kda glucose-regulated protein grp <dig> is of great importance. this lumenal endoplasmic reticulum plays a role in immunoglobulin folding as was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation in four different b cell hybridoma cell lines  <cit> . in our previous study several immunoglobulins were found to be either repressed or absent in serum of egf tumour bearing mice and this was particularly obvious for the ig k and l classes  <cit> . it remains to be determined whether repression of immunoglobulins can be attributed to aberrant grp <dig> activity.

a summary of the biological functions in addition to their previous reported tumour association is given in additional file 16: table s <dig> while the regulation of genes coding for newly identified proteins and of genes coding for commonly regulated proteins in liver tumours and serum of egf2b-transgenic mice is given in additional file 17: table s <dig> and additional file 18: table s <dig> 

master regulatory networks
initially the network construction was based on proteins exclusively expressed in tumours and by selecting master regulatory proteins linked to egfr signalling. thereafter, a fused hybrid network was developed in which tumour specific proteins were part of it. subsequently, the search was extended to all significantly regulated proteins . this revealed  <dig> master regulatory proteins and its associated networks and encompassed  <dig> proteins of which  <dig> were disease regulated. eventually a fused network was developed; however not all disease regulated proteins are part of it. the performed pathway mapping over fused networks  defined protein interactions and grouped  <dig> disease regulated proteins into  <dig> distinct pathways of which platelet activation, signalling and aggregation is a major one .

specifically, the glycoprotein fibrinogen is a multimeric protein and consists of α, ß and y subunits. it is synthesized by hepatocytes and an essential blood coagulation factor with all polypeptide chains being highly regulated in tumours of egf transgenic mice. note, an association between coagulation factors and malignancies was established whereby fibrinogen functions as an extracellular matrix protein to interact with integrin receptors in the control of cell proliferation and cell migration  <cit> . accordingly, induced gene expression of the integrin receptors itgb <dig>  itga <dig> and itgav was observed in egf induced liver tumours. in cancer progression a regulatory loop between fibrinogen, platelets and tumour cells has been determined that is activated by platelet cytosolic ca2+. this second messenger induces integrin receptor complex formation through an association of platelet glycoprotein chains iib and iiia  thereby creating an active binding site for fibrinogen. an association of tumour regulated proteins with the regulatory loop was confirmed in string analysis  and fibrinogen was reported to be an important determinant for metastasis of circulating tumour cells  <cit> . it is therefore of no surprise that elevated blood fibrinogen is a poor prognostic factor. haemostatic complications are commonly observed in cancer patients and future therapeutic strategies may focus on the hemostatic system by targeting tumour stroma. in this regard the tumour specific induction of plasminogen is of great importance. this zymogen  <cit>  is converted to plasmin by urokinase , a serine protease which itself was unchanged; however, gene expression of its receptor was significantly up-regulated in transgenic non-tumour livers. one report suggests the urokinase receptor to prime cells for proliferation in response to egf by promoting tyr <dig> phosphorylation and stat5b activation; nonetheless, this depended on intracellular c-src levels  <cit> .

further studies established a link between induced expression of plasminogen activator, upa receptor and plasminogen activator inhibitor type- <dig>  and invasiveness and metastasis of hcc  <cit> . indeed, a fine balance exists between the plasminogen activating system and its inhibition by pai- <dig> and pai- <dig>  based on transcriptomic data a highly significant induction of pai-i  in large tumours of egf transgenic mice was observed  <cit> ; consequently, the regulation of components of the plasminogen activating system may be considered as part of a strategy to degrade extracellular matrix thereby facilitating invasion and metastasis  <cit> .

to meet energy demands efficiently different sources are utilized and the induction of the proteins aldoa, aldoc, eno <dig>  pkm and fbp <dig> is testimony to an altered glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway. however, with the exception of acyl-coa thioesterase  <dig> that was below the limit of detection and functions in the hydrolysis of myristoyl- palmitoyl-, stearoyl- and arachidoyl-coa esters the regulation of enzymes linked to fatty acid metabolism in mitochondria and peroxisomes was hardly observed.

in pursue of tumour growth and to sustain organelle and membrane biogenesis lipids are de novo synthesized and mobilized from stores and while the complex interaction of hepatic lipid and glucose metabolism in liver disease is the subject of intense research  <cit>  the present study evidences significant regulation of several apolipoproteins, i.e. apoe, apoa <dig>  apoa <dig> and isoforms of albumin. apart from lipid transport apolipoproteins play a wider role in cancers and are known to interact with diverse receptors to elicit cellular events as demonstrated for apoe to cause sustained proliferation and survival of cancer cells  <cit> .

a further group of highly regulated proteins are aldo-keto reductases. their quantitative evaluation in different hepatocellular carcinoma  cell lines was recently reported  <cit> . this superfamily of proteins comprises nad-dependent enzymes which catalyze oxidoreduction of a variety of prostaglandins, steroids and toxic aldehydes. their involvement in tumorigenesis is supported by several studies and they are explored as drug targets to overcome chemoresistance. in the present study the aldo-keto reductases akr1c <dig>  akr1c <dig> and akr1c <dig> were uniquely expressed in tumours, however glutathione peroxidase  <dig> was repressed to 30% of healthy control livers to possibly support hif- <dig> signalling. indeed, the redox state and therefore glutathione participates in the hypoxic induction of hif- <dig>  <cit> , and two proteins of the glycolytic pathway, i.e. aldoa <dig> and eno <dig>  which respond to hif- <dig> signalling, were regulated. moreover, glutathione peroxidase  <dig> was shifted in the gel as shown in figure  <dig> panel g iii as a result of post translational modifications that most likely involved c-abl and arg kinase activity at tyr  <dig> of gpx <dig>  <cit> . likewise, the genes coding for aldo <dig> and eno <dig> were significantly up-regulated in egf induced liver tumours.

a complex interaction exists between egfr and rage signalling. this receptor for advanced glycation end-products is a member of the immunoglobulin family of cell surface molecules and was reported to significantly influence hepatic tumour growth in murine models of colorectal carcinoma  <cit> . there is strong evidence for rage to promote cancer growth upon ligand dependent activation and several proteins of the s <dig> family bind to the extracellular domain of rage  <cit> . it is of considerable importance that gene expression of s100a <dig> and s100a <dig> was up to 34-fold induced in tumours of egf transgenic mice, however expression of s100a <dig> was repressed. likewise the tumour specific expression of the rage binding proteins lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble,  <dig> and capza <dig> in tumours of egf transgenic mice is highly suggestive for a sustained crosstalk between rage and egfr  <cit> . although the precise mechanism by which s <dig> proteins stimulate egfr signalling remains to be elucidated binding of s100a <dig> to egf and to other egfr ligands was reported to possibly facilitate interaction with the receptor  <cit> . similarly, the binding of s100a8/a <dig> to rage was shown to promote migration and invasion of human breast cancer cells through actin polymerization and epithelial–mesenchymal transition  <cit> . conversely, advanced glycation endproduct  receptor  <dig> suppressed oxidant stress-dependent signalling via the egfr and shc/grb2/ras pathway  <cit> .

as depicted in figure  <dig> the amino acid metabolism was another distinct pathway to which several of the regulated proteins could be mapped to. note, the tumour specific regulations of arginine  <dig> and  <dig> as well as the regulation of subunits of the proteasome 26s atpase  were already discussed . in the following additional proteins regulated in this pathway are briefly summarized.

specifically, 3-hydroxyanthranilate- <dig> -dioxygenase  catalyzes oxidation of 3-hydroxyanthranilate to quinolinate and this intermediate functions as a precursor in nad and pyridine biosynthetic pathways. expression of haao was significantly repressed in tumours of egf transgenic mice and hypermethylation of the coding gene was observed in ovarian cancer  <cit> . due to the fact that haao is significantly repressed at the gene and protein level in at least two different tumour entities  the protein may function as a tumour suppressor that appears to be repressed by an epigenetic mechanism.

a significant finding is the tumour specific expression of 3- phosphoglycerate- dehydrogenase which catalyses the production of 3-phosphoglycerate. this intermediate of glycolysis is an essential precursor of the serine biosynthetic pathway. importantly, a recent metabolomic study evidenced 3-phosphoglycerate to be diverted into serine and glycine metabolism and repressed expression of 3-phosphoglyceratedehydrogenase resulted in impaired tumour cell proliferation  <cit> . in support of tumour growth the diversion of intermediate of glycolysis affects protein, membrane lipid and nucleotide synthesis.

moreover, the observed induction of creatine kinase in tumours of egf transgenic mice creates a circuitry for cellular energy homeostasis in conditions of high metabolic demands  <cit> . the enzyme catalyses the reversible transfer of phosphate from phosphocreatine to adp to yield atp and creatine. its induction has been observed in many cancers including liver cancer cell lines  <cit>  and a further study suggested a possible interplay between p <dig> mutations, hcc, ck expression with growth-inhibitory effects of cyclocreatine in hcc  <cit> .

while the rationale of tumour cells in embarking on abnormal metabolism had already been discussed  the finding that agmatine ureohydrolase was strongly repressed in egf induced liver tumours to about 10% of non-transgenic healthy livers is of great importance. this enzyme hydrolyzes agmatine  to form putrescine and urea and repression of the enzyme will significantly increase agmatine tissue concentration to influence diverse cellular control mechanisms. importantly, in the study of battaglia and coworkers  <cit>  1 mm agmatine induced large amounts of superoxide production in rat liver mitochondria; however, it did not affect mitochondrial respiration or redox levels of thiols and glutathione. furthermore, atp synthesis remained normal and prevented ca-induced mitochondrial permeability transition in the presence of phosphate to suggest an intriguing regulatory loop whereby h2o <dig> induces hypoxia signalling that is linked to abberant metabolism, nonetheless by selecting interconnected physiological pathways tumour cells are equipped to avoid programmed cell death  <cit> . thus, arginine deprivation is evaluated for its utility in cancer therapy  <cit> .

a further enzyme repressed to 20% of healthy non-transgenic liver is carbamoyl phosphate synthetase  <dig> , i.e. a liver specific ligase to function in ammonia detoxification. it is perplexing that tumour cells disable such an important pathway of the urea cycle. however, a recent study demonstrated dna hypermethylation as a key mechanism of silencing cps <dig> gene expression in human hcc. note, forced expression of cps <dig> induced cell proliferation and the observed repression in human hcc may simply be the result of genomic instability as was observed in tumour cells  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
the present study identified novel disease regulated proteins induced by overexpression of egf to provide new insight into the complex signalling events in hcc. six major pathways perturbed by egfr hyperactivity were identified and several of the regulated proteins are interesting drug target candidates and this includes tumour specific expression of kinases as well as proteins involved in aberrant metabolism. an identification of commonly regulated proteins in tumour and sera will be of great utility in the development of biomarkers to monitor disease progression and responses to therapy.
