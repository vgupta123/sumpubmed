BACKGROUND
fundamental biological processes including cell differentiation, metabolism, the cell cycle or signal transduction are governed by the expression of genes. gene products and especially the amounts and temporal patterns in which these products are expressed in the cell enable cell survival and numerous cellular functions. a holistic view on the regulatory mechanisms governing the dynamics of genes expression requires the understanding of the networking and interactions among genes and their products, since it is known that genes act in a collective manner to achieve biological functions  <cit> . by understanding the complex relations within these gene regulatory networks  we can highlight inhibitory or excitatory interactions, as well as how intracellular or extracellular factors affect gene products or dysregulate cellular processes.

the recent advances in biotechnology allowed simultaneous measurements of mrna production from virtually all genes within genomes through high-throughput technologies such as the microarrays  <cit> . this resulted in massive amounts of data that proved to be a significant challenge for traditional analysis techniques due to the inherent combinatorial problems arising from the large number of variables. advanced computational models are required to fill in the knowledge gap. these models have to cope with peculiarities of the data such as measurement noise. additional challenges are posed by the modelling task, such as the under-determinism caused by the large number of variables compared to the available number of experiments. also, since groups of genes are commonly acting to activate/inhibit a regulated gene, the computational search space grows to a much larger potential search space of virtually countless combinations  <cit> .

initial computational approaches for inferring gene regulatory networks from gene expression data consisted of classical techniques. boolean networks are binary models that consider the expression of a gene to be either on or off, and model the effects of other genes on a specific target gene through a boolean function. a major drawback is the fact they do not consider intermediate levels of gene expression, hence resulting in information loss  <cit> . furthermore, they assume transitions between genes activation states to be synchronous, which is biologically implausible  <cit> . bayesian networks  are a mixture of probability calculus and graph theory, and attempt to model gene regulatory networks as directed acyclic graphs in which the nodes represent the genes and the edges connecting the nodes represent regulatory interactions, which are encoded via conditional dependences learned from the data. although effective in dealing with noise, incompleteness and stochastic aspects of gene regulation, they fail to consider temporal dynamic aspects that are an important part of regulatory networks modelling  <cit> . dynamic bayesian networks  evolved feedback loops to effectively deal with the temporal aspects of regulatory networks but their benefits are hindered by the high computational cost required for learning the conditional dependencies in the cases where large numbers of genes are involved  <cit> . linear additive regulation models  <cit>  revealed certain linear relations in regulatory systems but failed to capture nonlinear dynamics aspects of genes regulation. other approaches included differential equations, which besides the high computational costs have also the disadvantage of being sensitive to noisy data   <cit> .

recent approaches tried to overcome the drawback of traditional methods in several ways  <cit> . keedwell and narayanan  <cit>  used a hybrid neuro-genetic algorithm to mitigate the under-determinism problem. their method combines genetic algorithms  with a single layer artificial neural-network , where each chromosome of the ga selects from the whole data set a small number of regulating genes and the ann is used to determine how the expression levels of these input genes affect another gene's expression. however, the lack of a recurrent structure and the training method of the ann may pose serious problems when modelling the complex temporal dynamics of gene expression regulation and renders the method vulnerable to local minima traps, respectively.

some of the most effective approaches towards problems regarding temporal information processing are the recurrent neural networks   <cit>  and recurrent fuzzy neural networks   <cit> . recurrent networks, in general, can deal with temporal and spatial/temporal problems by adapting self loops and backward connections to their topologies and structures, both of which are used to memorize past information. recently, xu et al  <cit>  used an rnn combined with particle swarm optimization  to capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of gene regulatory networks. although rnns are generally efficient for temporal sequence production problems, it has been shown that recurrent fuzzy networks outperform recurrent neural networks  <cit>  in problems that involve concurrent spatial and temporal mapping like the one of regulatory networks reconstruction. additionally, fuzzy-based approaches are better candidates in dealing with the uncertainties of modelling noisy data, due to their high-level, human-like reasoning  <cit> . in  <cit>  regulatory interactions among genes are extracted in the form of fuzzy if-then rules by searching for statistically significant fuzzy dependency relationships among genes. in  <cit> , sokhansanj et al perform an exhaustive search for possible rules describing gene interactions , under the framework of a linear fuzzy logic scheme that restricts the search space. however, both methods have the drawback of requiring prior data discretization, while  <cit>  has the additional disadvantage of not considering temporal information.

in this study, we propose a novel multi-layer evolutionary trained neuro-fuzzy recurrent network  applied to the problem of grn reconstruction, which addresses the major drawbacks of currently existing computational methods. our choice was driven by the benefits, in terms of computational power, that neural network based methods provide  <cit> . the self-organized nature of enfrn algorithm is able to produce an adaptive number of temporal fuzzy rules that describe the relationships between the input  genes and the output  gene. related to that, another advantage of our approach is that it overcomes the need of prior data discretization, a characteristic of many computational methods which often leads to information loss  <cit> . the dynamic mapping capabilities emerging from the recurrent structure of enfrn and the incorporation of fuzzy logic drive the construction of easily interpretable fuzzy rules of the form: 'if gene x is highly expressed at time t then its dependent/target gene y will be lowly expressed at time t+1'. the evolutionary training, based on the pso framework, tries to avoid the drawbacks of classical neural networks training algorithms. additionally, we are approaching the under-determinism problem by selecting the most suitable set of regulatory genes via a time-effective procedure embedded in the construction phase of enfrn. also, besides determining the regulatory relations among genes, our method can determine the type of the regulation  and at the same time assign a score, which might be used as a measure of confidence in the retrieved regulation. experiments on real data sets derived from microarray experiments on saccharomyces cerevisiae prove the ability of the proposed method to capture biologically established gene regulatory interactions, outperforming at the same time other computational methods.

RESULTS
we applied our method on saccharomyces cerevisiae gene expression data obtained from cell cycle microarray experiments to identify regulatory interactions and construct putative regulatory networks. the cell cycle process consists of four phases: g <dig> , s , g <dig> , and m . after the m phase, the cell enters the g <dig> phase, hence completing a 'cycle'  <cit> .

the datasets we employed originate from a study containing measurements of virtually all yeast genes  across  <dig> time points . in spellman et al.'s experiments, yeast cell cultures were synchronized with different methods including Î±lpha factors arrest , temperature arrest of temperature sensitive mutants  and elutriation synchronization   <cit> . this data set includes also a subset from a previous experiment in which the cells were synchronized by temperature arrest of a cdc <dig> allele   <cit> , as well as  <dig> samples initially intended for a study on cyclins cln3p and clb2p.

it must be noted at this point that all the results in this study were obtained using cdc <dig> as training set for the enfrn models, while alpha and cdc <dig> subsets as testing data sets. the choice for this training set was based on the fact that it had the largest amount of time points. alpha subset was chosen because it originates from the same experimental setting to the training data set and possesses the largest amount of data after cdc <dig>  at the same time, it allows us to provide comparison to other methods that have used the same data set. cdc <dig> was chosen to provide a means of testing the method against data originating from a different experimental setting than that of the training. for reasons of simplicity and coherence we will present in the following results based on alpha data set . similar results were obtained when using cdc <dig> subset as testing set. full details on the results of cdc <dig>  as well as general settings of the parameters of the algorithm and additional information regarding both test data sets, are provided in 'additional file 1'.

to evaluate the performance of enfrn and compare our results with those of other published methods, we used four groups of genes. the first one consisted of eight histone genes  that encode the four core histones . the histones are the main protein components of chromatin, forming its fundamental packaging unit. since the chromosomes  need to be replicated before cell division, the expression of histone genes should be regulated tightly for the proper functioning of the replication process  <cit> . using a composite score lower than  <dig>  for selecting a regulatory interaction, we have built the network presented in figure  <dig>  out of the  <dig> currently known genetic interactions we have retrieved  <dig>  the rest of the interactions we have retrieved are indexed in the yeast databases as physical interactions, thus being indirectly supported   <cit> . the existence of a physical interaction among two entities reflects the fact that protein products of the respective genes interact at protein level and the existence of the interaction was experimentally proven. for example, the hhf <dig> - hta <dig> was marked as a physical interaction by several affinity capture-ms experiments  <cit> . this could reflect the existence of certain correlations in their gene expression level, therefore triggering our method to retrieve it as a valid interaction. table  <dig> lists all extracted interactions, their type and corresponding composite score, as well as comparative information on the currently existing biological knowledge. it should be noted that when comparing to the results of chen et al  <cit> , our method retrieved  <dig> interactions , while only  <dig> were retrieved with the bayesian network approach of chen et al. the comparison is even more relevant when restricted to the genetic interactions, which are the main goal of the compared approaches : enfrn-based method identified  <dig> genetic interactions out of  <dig>  as noted above, while in the case of the bayesian network only  <dig> out of  <dig> were genetic interactions. table  <dig> provides intermediate results regarding the enfrn performance during the optimization process.

the table shows regulator and target genes implicated in the interaction, the type of regulation determined and the value of composite score. in the last two columns we provide the kind of biological evidence that supports the interaction.

we can depict a decrease at the complexity levels  between the initial and the simplified structures followed by a corresponding decrease in the score levels between the phases of the initial and the trained enfrn.

in a second experiment we further tested and compared our approach against other well known algorithms for grn reconstruction, on a well studied pathway consisting of  <dig> genes. specifically, we have compared against bayesian networks  and dynamic bayesian networks . the target sub-network we studied  has been used as a benchmark dataset in many similar studies  <cit> . our method outperformed the ones we have used for comparison. as we can resolve by inspecting figure  <dig> and table  <dig>  our enfrn-based approach extracted  <dig> biologically validated interactions ,  <dig> interactions that are biologically validated via an intermediate gene  and  <dig> interactions that are erroneous . additionally, in order to explicitly test the efficiency of our proposed hybrid network, we have replaced enfrn with another neuro-fuzzy recurrent network named rsonfin  <cit> , and applied it within the same framework for reconstructing grns described in this paper. the results shown in 'additional file 1', indicate the superiority of enfrn in terms of both biologically validated interactions and computational time. enfrn managed to infer the reconstructed grn faster than all methods used for comparison. additional details and evidence regarding the computational times of the compared methods are provided in 'additional file 1'.

the 3rd column provides scores of the final trained enfrn structure responsible for determining a specific interaction. column 'type' indicates whether a determined interaction is true , true via an intermediate gene  or false . in the last column we indicate which models detected the interaction described in columns  <dig> and  <dig> 

we next proceed evaluating our approach on larger datasets. hence, the third set we tested, consisted of  <dig> genes which include dna polymerases , dna helicase , type b cyclin genes , dna primases , radiation sensitive genes , repair related genes , replication protein a encoding gene , dna replication initiation factor , securin gene , nucleosome assembly factor , and a subunit of the cohesin complex . these genes play an important role in the process of cell cycle conducting important cellular activities such as dna replication initiation, dna damage-induced checkpoint arrest, dna damage repair, formation of mitotic spindle, and so on. as observed in figure  <dig>  enfrn retrieved  <dig> regulatory interactions among  <dig> genes . bold edges denote retrieved interactions that are backed by genetic interaction while dashed edges correspond to those having physical interaction counterparts in experimental databases . thin edges denote interactions that could not be found neither in biogrid nor sgd. for  <dig> out of  <dig> interactions there exists biological experimental evidence stored in the biogrid and saccharomyces genome database . this is more than double the number of valid interactions the method of chen  <cit>  found using the same group of genes. of particular interest is the upregulation of cyclin clb <dig> involved in dna replication during s phase by the securing gene pds <dig>  this regulation is substantially supported by experimental evidence at both genetic and protein level  <cit> , however it has not been retrieved by chen et al's method. the composite score of enfrn for this interaction was relatively low , thus underlining the high confidence of the retrieved regulation. an interesting case is that of pri2-pol <dig>  which we inferred as a valid interaction. although we could not find existing biological experimental information regarding the respective genetic interaction, there was significant evidence of physical interaction among the protein products of this pair of genes from a series of affinity capture-ms experiments  <cit> . it must be noted that this interaction was marked as a valid genetic interaction by chen et al  <cit> , although their cited evidence highlighted it as a protein-protein interaction via tandem affinity purification experiments  <cit> . a complete list of our interactions, their composite scores and experimental information can be found in 'additional file 1'.

in a final experiment we aimed at testing the performance of enfrn on a larger group of genes. this group of genes was selected by chen et al and includes  <dig> cell-cycle target genes and their regulators  <cit> , a total of  <dig> genes. due to the particularities of this dataset , we have relaxed the constraint on the number of possible regulators for a gene from  <dig> to  <dig>  as presented in figure  <dig>  our method retrieved a total of  <dig> interactions. out of these,  <dig> were found to have corresponding genetic interaction experimental evidence, while  <dig> interactions corresponded to previously proven physical interactions  <cit> . this totalled to  <dig> % accordance to currently valid biological knowledge. interestingly, we have found  <dig> cases in which experimentally valid interactions from the biogrid database are connected in our network through only one intermediate node. as noted by other studies, these indirect interactions might reflect a conjunctive action of the respective entities for the regulation of the target entity  <cit> . this means that a total of  <dig> % of the edges in our network are supported directly or indirectly by biological experimental evidence.

our results highlight the crucial role of cyclins in the cell cycle, of which the most typical is clb <dig> as reported by others  <cit> . accordingly, enfrn identified the upregulating interaction among clb <dig> and clb <dig>  <cit> . worth to be noted is also the activation of the ndd <dig> by the clb <dig> that takes place in the g <dig> phase of the cycle, which is part of the larger scale interactions between clb <dig> and the sff complex   <cit> . mcm <dig>  a dna binding protein that works with the sff complex, has been placed in direct interaction with fkh <dig>  thus highlighting its role within the complex.

the important role of the cyclin-dependent kinase sic <dig> is captured by its close interaction with the g1-cyclins cln <dig> . additionally, the documented inhibition of sic <dig> by the sff component fkh <dig> and the inhibition of swi <dig> by the same fkh <dig> were correctly retrieved  <cit> . the control of the cyclins cln <dig>  by the sbf complex   <cit>  is reflected by the direct interconnection among these genes. also, the suggested upstream activation of cln <dig> by cln <dig> at the beginning of the cell cycle  <cit>  was promptly retrieved by our method.

in a number of cases the microarray data show transcriptional co-regulation patterns and although the gene products are not physically interacting, this tight genetic connection might suggest that genes sustain indirect connections through other gene products  <cit> . computational methods usually accommodate this scenario by considering indirect connections through one or even two intermediate nodes  <cit> . a large number of such interactions can be identified in our network, such as the indirect activation of clb <dig> by the sbf and mbf complexes   <cit> . another example is the loop where the transcription of swe <dig> activated by cln <dig> takes place in our network indirectly, through genes cln <dig> and yhp <dig>  <cit> . additional information on the interactions and their composite scores is presented in 'additional file 1'.

as a final comment we should notice that many of the gene regulatory interactions take place exclusively at a specific phase of the cell-cycle, the pair of interacting genes remaining silent for the rest of the cycle. problems arise in such cases from the reduced availability of experimental samples . despite the great difficulties deriving from this fact, we have proven that the proposed enfrn-based method managed to acquire biologically validated relations among genes from about 60% to even 100%  percent of the extracted interactions.

CONCLUSIONS
fundamental processes occurring in organisms are carried out through complex networks of regulatory interactions among genes and their products. the inference of gene regulatory networks based on experimental data obtained from microarrays has become an important way to understand these regulatory mechanisms. herein we describe a novel evolutionary trained neuro-fuzzy recurrent network to model the regulatory networks and reveal interactions between genes. our model is able to identify potential regulators of genes through a time efficient process. the recurrent structure of enfrn ensures that the dynamics of gene expression are properly retained while, at the same time, the self-organizing properties of the method automatically account for the discretization process. the self-organization combined with the inherent fuzzy logic successfully manage to deal with the important amount of noise present in microarray data and at the same time provide an efficient representation of the interactions through fuzzy rules.

one of the key characteristics of the proposed approach is that by incorporating enfrns neural network-specific processing and learning capabilities the method can be applied  to unseen samples arriving from microarray data of different experimental settings in order to test whether the same regulatory interactions are valid within the new data set.

the proposed enfrn-based method successfully extracted relations that in their majority were in accordance with biologically proven regulatory interactions, outperforming other computational approaches. in certain cases our algorithm picked up interactions that could not be retrieved in the lists of experimental interactions currently existing in databases. it might be possible that some of these interactions are valid but currently unknown, since the available experimental data is still far from complete at present. however, those interactions and especially the ones assigned a high degree of confidence should be further examined.
