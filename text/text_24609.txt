BACKGROUND
although yeasts, in common with most cellular organisms, can derive energy from a variety of different molecules, glucose is well-known to be their preferred source, because it provides more energy than any other saccharide. therefore, yeasts have evolved a complex genetic network to make sure they can consume as much glucose as possible when it is available  <cit> . in  <cit> , the authors experimentally investigated the regulation of galactose metabolism in s. cerevisiæ, which is mediated by several positive and negative feedback loops acting at the transcriptional level. to probe the system for multistability, two identical cell populations were grown on different media, with and without galactose, respectively. in engineering terms, this amounts to initializing the system at two different operating conditions. starting from these conditions, the two populations were then exposed to identical galactose concentrations for a period long enough to guarantee the attainment of steady-state conditions. for intermediate levels of the input , the two populations settled on different steady states, thus confirming the multistable nature of the system. these and other experimental results have revealed that the gal system exhibits bistable dynamics and that such bistability generates a persistent memory of the type of carbon source consumed by the cell in the past.

in previous work, classical mathematical tools, such as bifurcation analysis, have been used to examine the dynamics of the gal regulatory network, see e.g.  <cit> . recently, we showed, using a control-theoretic analysis, that the gal network simplified mass-action models proposed in  <cit> , do not reproduce the bistable behavior exhibited by the experimental studies of acar and coworkers; this finding motivated us to propose a new model of the gal system,  <cit> . in this paper we extend this model and provide a thorough characterization of its dynamical properties, with the aim of validating it as a plausible mechanistic explanation of the persistent memory property. our approach starts with the analysis of the model’s bistable dynamics as a structural property, arising from the topology of the reaction network. afterwards, we focus on the study of the robustness of bistability both against fluctuations of the concentrations of the molecular species, caused by endogenous stochastic noise or by exogenous perturbations, and in the face of parametric uncertainties. the principle underpinning these analyses is that the quality of a model cannot be solely evaluated by its capability to reproduce a particular set of experimental measurements. indeed, a common problem in modeling biological networks is that alternative, structurally different models can fit experimental data equally well  <cit> . in order to represent a plausible mechanistic description of a biological phenomenon, the model must also replicate an essential feature of biological systems, that is robustness against inter-individual parametric variability and in vivo fluctuating environmental conditions  <cit> .

our characterization of the robustness properties of the model starts with an analysis of the domains of attractions  of the bistable system. roughly speaking, the da of an equilibrium point xe is a region d in the state space, such that xe∈d and every state trajectory crossing d converges asymptotically to xe. da analysis is crucial for establishing whether the proposed model provides a plausible explanation of the phenomenon under investigation, since the system is actually able to operate around a given equilibrium point with some degree of robustness in the face of both intrinsic stochastic noise and exogenous perturbations only if that equilibrium point possesses a nontrivial da. note that the estimation of the da is, in general, a difficult problem for systems of nontrivial dimension. in our approach we show how, for any mass-action model, it is possible to apply a convex optimization-based method, devised in a purely theoretical context by our group in  <cit> , to test whether an assigned polytopic subset of the state space belongs to the da of an equilibrium point.

we next consider the robustness of the model’s bistable dynamics in the face of uncertain parameter values. many examples can be found in the literature of studies applying local sensitivity and bifurcations analysis as tools for characterizing the parametric robustness of biological systems, e.g.  <cit> ; however, these tools suffer from a significant limitation due to their inability to take into account more than one or two simultaneous parameters variation at the same time. multi-parametric sensitivity analysis of biomodels is typically performed by resorting to extensive sampling of the admissible parameter space,  <cit> , which requires a large large computational effort and can only provide probabilistic conclusions. to overcome these limitations, besides applying local sensitivity and bifurcations analysis, we employ a global sensitivity analysis method proposed in  <cit> . this method is aimed at computing an outer approximation of the region of the state space that contains all the equilibrium points of a given biosystem for all admissible values of the parameters. in our analysis, we devise a straightforward way to adapt this method to provide robustness certificates for bistability in the face of parametric uncertainty.

thus, beyond our primary goal of validating a new model of the bistable gal regulatory network, we also present what should be a widely applicable and effective procedure for investigating the plausibility of dynamical models of multistable biomolecular circuits, without recourse to large-scale numerical simulations.

RESULTS
a new model of the gal regulatory network in s. cerevisiæ
the regulatory network of galactose metabolism, depicted in figure  <dig>  is governed by the following factors: a transcriptional activator protein gal4p, a signal transducer protein gal3p and an inhibitor protein gal80p. in the presence of galactose, gal4p activates transcription of gal <dig>  gal <dig>  gal <dig>  which are regulatory genes, and of gal <dig> and several other genes , which encode the enzymes of the leloir pathway  of galactose metabolism. the protein encoded by gene gal <dig> acts as a mediator of galactose transport into the yeast cell. in the absence of external galactose, gal80p binds to the activation domain of gal4p, thus inhibiting the expression of the gal genes. in the presence of galactose, however, the inducer gal3p is activated to form the complex gal80p:gal3p*, which promotes the shuttling of gal80p from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. this decreases the fraction of gal80p-bound gal4p in the nucleus. thus, galactose relieves the inactivation of gal4p and promotes transcription of the gal genes  <cit> .

the mathematical model of this regulatory network considered here is based on mass-action kinetics and represents an extended version of the model proposed in  <cit> . in the new version of the model, the reaction of reversible dissociation of the complex gal80p:gal3p* is explicitly included, since this was found to be essential to ensure robustness of the bistable dynamics, according to the analysis procedure that will be illustrated in the next sections. moreover, in the new model also the gal1p protein dynamics are taken into account, since the concentration of this protein is taken as a measure of gal4p activity in the experiments reported in  <cit> . model consists of the following set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations ,

the ode model  can be rewritten in compact form as 

  x˙=nv, 

where the species concentrations, namely the state variables listed in table  <dig>  are denoted by x:=t, the parameters by p:=t∈ℝ <dig> , n∈ℝ9× <dig> is the stoichiometric matrix and v∈ℝ <dig> is the vector of reaction rates. since the parameters are inherently positive, positive values of x will result in positive values of v, i.e. x∈ℝ+9⇒v∈ℝ+ <dig>  in the next section, we present the results of our analysis of the bistable dynamical properties of this model.

structural analysis of the proposed model’s network topology confirms bistable dynamics
the first step of our procedure consists in the analysis of the topology of the regulatory network, to determine whether its structure can admit a bistable behavior. subsequently, we will determine a possible realization  of model  that exhibits bistability.

the persistence of cellular memory exhibited by the galactose regulatory network is a system-level property which results from the interactions of several species in multiple nested feedback loops. two coupled positive feedback loops involve the galactose permease gal2p and the signaling protein gal3p, while a negative feedback loop involves the inhibitor gal80p. recall that, according to  <cit> , the existence of a positive-feedback loop, or a mutually inhibitory, double-negative-feedback loop, is a necessary condition for the occurrence of multistability.

model  is said to exhibit bistability if there exist a parameter vector p¯∈ℝ+ <dig>  and two finite distinct equilibrium points xe <dig> xe2∈ℝ <dig> such that 

  nv= <dig> 

  nv= <dig> 

the existence of a solution to eqs. . such scaling yields an equilibrium concentration of 1mm for gex; note also that it does not affect other equations, since the kinetic constant k <dig> does not appear elsewhere in the model.

characterization of the domains of attraction confirms robustness of the bistable equilibria
subsequently to the determination of the asymptotically stable equilibrium points, a primary goal in the characterization of the behavior of a system is that of estimating the da’s of such points. accurate estimates of the da’s provide valuable information about the ability of a system to reject perturbations driving the system away from its steady state condition. at the same time, the boundaries of the da’s constitute the concentration thresholds for the activation of the switching mechanism between different operative conditions.

the methodology proposed in  <cit> , which allows to check whether an assigned box in the state space belongs to the da of an equilibrium, has been employed in our study. it is worth noticing that the main result of  <cit>  leads to a linear matrix inequality  feasibility problem, which can be solved efficiently via off-the-shelf numerical algorithms.

in order to find the largest possible estimates of the da’s of xe <dig> and xe <dig>  namely d~ <dig> and d~ <dig>  our procedure takes two small initial polytopic regions, surrounding the equilibrium points, and then iteratively stretches them along the different dimensions of the state space until the feasibility conditions are no longer verified, thus obtaining two inner approximations of the da’s.

the estimates obtained by means of this procedure are 

 d~1=××××××××d~2=×××××××× 

for xe <dig> and xe <dig>  respectively . the validity of these estimates is confirmed by numerical simulations, performed with initial conditions varying within the boxes computed by the proposed approach . note that the admissible excursion intervals, as determined by the estimated da’s , are fairly large for most of the state variables: looking at figure 2a one can readily recognize that the key species that drives the switching between the two metabolic conditions is the complex gal4p:gal80p, which is associated to a smaller admissible fluctuation interval with respect to the other species . thus, the da’s analysis highlights that a tight regulation of the concentration of gal4p:gal80p is paramount to the proper functioning of the genetic switch.

local and global analysis confirm robustness of the bistable equilibria to parametric uncertainty
in this section we provide further support for the plausibility of the proposed model of the gal regulatory system by characterizing its robustness with respect to parametric uncertainties.

the underlying principle is that, in view of the large inter-individual variability of biochemical parameters, for a model to be considered plausible it is not sufficient to reproduce the qualitative behavior of the biological system for just one set of parameter values; instead, this behavior must be exhibited over a nontrivial subset of the parameters space.

first, a classical sensitivity analysis is performed by employing the method discussed in  <cit> : the state variables ode’s are coupled to the equations of sensitivity.

this allows us to compute a numerical solution to the whole set of equations, thus simultaneously obtaining both the state variables and the associated sensitivity coefficients.

the normalized sensitivity coefficients for the proposed model are shown in figure 4: greater sensitivity is exhibited by the parameters involved in the feedback terms , the basal expression of gal4p , those involved in the internalization of external galactose and in the activation of gal3p , and the parameters that describe the degradation of gal3p, internalized galactose and gal2p , respectively. it is worth recalling that the indications of robustness provided by the sensitivity coefficients must be taken with caution, keeping in mind that this type of analysis is only valid locally, i.e., in the neighborhood of the nominal values reported in table  <dig> 

we next determine the critical points of the system, i.e., the points at which system’s dynamics undergo abrupt changes. we have conducted a bifurcation analysis with respect to those parameters that exhibit large sensitivity values. taking gal1p concentration as the output of our model, the interval of bistability with respect to a certain parameter is delimited by the pair of limit points forming the classical s-shaped bifurcation curve. as an example, the bifurcation diagram generated by variation of k <dig> is shown in figure 5: the admissible range of variation for the parameter k <dig> is ; outside this interval the system loses its bistable behavior. the bifurcation analysis can also be performed by allowing simultaneous variations of two parameters: in this case, the bistability thresholds, corresponding to the limit point bifurcations, are curves in the parameters plane. for example, in figure  <dig>  where k <dig>  k <dig> have been chosen as bifurcation parameters, we have detected two cusp bifurcation points at = and =. thus, the shaded region in figure  <dig> identifies a set of parameter values within which any value of the pair  guarantees bistable behavior .

unfortunately, the above methods can efficiently evaluate changes in steady state concentrations only for low-dimensional parameter variations. in  <cit> , a global sensitivity method, named biosdp, is proposed to evaluate the effect of multiple  parameter variations on the system’s dynamics. more specifically, this method can be used to compute some bounds on the maximum variation of the equilibrium points induced by changes of the parameter values. the computation is based on the solution of a dual problem : given a subset of the state space, say Ω, the biosdp algorithm is able to certificate that, for any admissible realization of the parameter vector p, Ω does not contain any equilibrium point.

the biosdp algorithm takes as inputs the admissible range of variation of the parameters, defined as a box ℬp in the parameter space, and an initial outer approximation, in the form of a box s~ <dig>  of the subset xe of all the admissible equilibrium points of system  subject to p∈ℬp.

then, these outer boundaries are iteratively narrowed by applying a bisection algorithm. as a result, the state space is partitioned in one or more subsets containing all the equilibrium points that fall inside the initial search subspace s~ <dig>  in fact, due to the computational burden, the bisection algorithm can only be applied to systems of dimension less or equal than three . for higher-order systems like ours, the algorithm resorts to a box shrinkage procedure, i.e., it just tries to reduce the size of the initial box as far as possible.

due to the above limitations, in our case the method proposed in  <cit>  would not be able to distinguish the two distinct steady state subsets. to overcome this issue, we devise a strategy that leverages the biosdp algorithm but, instead of computing one set containing all the equilibrium points, aims to separately compute two distinct robust steady state subsets s~ <dig> and s~ <dig>  which define the boundaries for the variation of xe <dig> and xe <dig>  respectively. thus, we need two initial outer approximation subsets, let us denote them by s~ <dig> and s~ <dig>  respectively.

guessing two good initial outer approximations would in general turn out to be a daunting task for systems of nontrivial dimension. in our case, exploiting the previous analysis and by virtue of continuity arguments, we surmise that, for small-enough variations of the parameter values, the da’s represent good initial guesses. thus, we let s~i0=ρid~i, i= <dig> , where ρi> <dig> is a scaling factor and apply the biosdp algorithm separately to these two initial boxes, with ρi=1; if the algorithm does not find a solution, it is re-applied iteratively with different values of ρi in a predefined interval , until a solution is found.

note that, setting s~i <dig> as the initial search space for the biosdp algorithm we are focusing the analysis on those equilibrium points that belong to a neighborhood of xei, instead of searching for all the equilibrium points. performing this analysis separately, first on xe <dig> and then on xe <dig>  enables us to ascertain whether the bistability is preserved against parametric perturbations: the answer is affirmative if we are able to compute two disjoint robust steady state subsets, i.e., s~1∩s~2=∅. if this problem is feasible for an assigned parameter box ℬp, then we are guaranteed that bistability is preserved for all p belonging to ℬp.

the initial outer approximations used for our analysis are reported in normalized parallel coordinates in figure 2b. their numerical values are  s~10=××××××××,s~20=××××××××. 

to alleviate the computational burden of the procedure, the multi-parametric sensitivity analysis has been limited to the parameters subset Θ:={k <dig> k <dig> k <dig> k <dig> k <dig> k <dig> μ <dig> μ <dig> μ17}, which, according to the local sensitivity analysis, have a major influence on the system dynamics . the robustness has been evaluated against increasingly larger ranges of parameter variations, corresponding to ±2%, ±5%, ±10%, ±20%, ±30% and ±50%, with respect to the nominal values given in table  <dig>  figure  <dig> displays the computed robust steady state boxes for the various cases. the bistable behavior of the gal regulatory network is guaranteed for parametric variations up to ±20% with respect to the nominal parameters value. for such uncertainty values, indeed, the computed subsets s~ <dig> and s~ <dig> are still disjoint, since the intervals of g 3a and g  <dig> a are not overlapping. for parametric variations of ±30% or more, the intersection of the two subsets is no longer empty ; in the latter case, it is no longer possible to guarantee that the system preserves bistability for all admissible parameter values.

discussion and 
CONCLUSIONS
robustness, intended as the capability to cope with fluctuations of the molecular species concentrations, caused by endogenous and exogenous perturbations, and to preserve biological functions despite inter-individual variability of kinetic parameters, is a key feature of biological systems. this fundamental feature poses an important challenge when trying to describe biological phenomena by means of mechanistic mathematical models: a set of differential/algebraic equations which, for some value of the parameters, interpolates experimental data, cannot be considered a plausible model if it does not possess the aforementioned robustness properties. recognizing the power of these arguments as tools for testing novel biomodels, and with the aim of supporting the validity of our proposed model of the gal regulatory network, we have devised an analytical procedure which can be exploited to investigate the robustness properties of biomodels of bistable biological systems. the procedure exploits several complementary methods for the analysis of nonlinear quadratic systems , devised both by our group and by other authors, and its effectiveness has been demonstrated by applying it to thoroughly characterize the robustness of bistability for a new model of the galactose metabolism regulatory system.

the procedure consists of three phases: in the first phase, the properties of the nominal system  are investigated, since the first requirement is that the reaction network is structurally compatible with the existence of multiple equilibrium points. this can be ascertained through the use of crnt, which also allows the computation of a candidate set of parameter values. subsequently, the second stage of the procedure focuses on the analysis of the da’s of the equilibrium points, using the method devised in  <cit> , since the da can be regarded as a robustness measure against perturbations that push the system away from its steady state operative condition. the third phase of the procedure consists in the analysis of the robustness of the system’s bistability with respect to parametric uncertainty. traditionally, this analysis is based on sensitivity and bifurcations analysis; however, these tools are rather limited, due to their inability to take into account multiple simultaneous parameter variations. to overcome these limitations, we have proposed a multi-parametric robustness analysis strategy: by opportunely leveraging a global sensitivity analysis method, and combining it with the information provided by our da’s analysis technique, we were able to certify the persistence of bistability in the face of multiple variations of the uncertain parameters.

beyond its specific application for validation of the proposed model of the gal regulatory network, the overall procedure provides a powerful approach for the analysis and validation of any biochemical network model which is required to robustly reproduce bistable dynamics, underlying persistent memory, molecular switches and cell differentiation phenomena, without recourse to large-scale numerical simulations.
