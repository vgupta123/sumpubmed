BACKGROUND
phosphodiesterases  are a large family of proteins with  <dig> identified human members divided into  <dig> subfamilies: pde1-pde <dig>  <cit> . the present work focuses on the photoreceptor cell-specific pde <dig> subfamily, which consist of α, β and α’ catalytic subunits encoded by the pde6a, pde6b and pde6c genes. pde <dig> catalytic activity is regulated by the γ and γ’ inhibitory subunits encoded by pde6g and pde6h, respectively  <cit> .

phylogenetic analyses complemented with chromosomal analyses in human previously published by our lab  <cit>  and phylogenetic data from other investigators  <cit>  suggested that the pde <dig> catalytic gene family with the pde6a, pde6b and pde6c genes expanded in the two rounds of whole genome duplications  that occurred early in vertebrate evolution  <cit> . other analyses of phylogeny and exon-intron organisation have shown that the pde <dig> subfamily is most closely related to the pde <dig> and pde <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . 2r was also proposed to explain the duplicates found in the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene family, whose genes were found to be located in the same paralogon  as the developmentally important homeobox gene clusters  <cit>  that are known to have been duplicated in 2r  <cit> .

pde <dig> proteins are expressed in vertebrate rod and cone photoreceptor cells. as for the other components of the phototransduction cascade , rods and cones use distinct but related pde <dig> subunits: rods express the pde6a and pde6b genes, which give rise to a catalytic heterodimer, and the pde6g inhibitory subunit gene, whereas cones express pde6c, resulting in a catalytic homodimer, and the pde6h inhibitory subunit gene  <cit> .

the pde <dig> catalytic subunit proteins have two gaf domains  followed by one catalytic domain, a structure that is shared with the pde <dig>  pde <dig>  pde <dig> and pde <dig> subfamilies  <cit> . the catalytic domain is present in all of the different pde subfamilies, with differences in substrate specificity  <cit> . the pde <dig> enzymes are distinguished from the other pde subfamilies by a much higher catalytic activity and two accessory inhibitory subunits that interact with a gaf domain and the catalytic domain of the catalytic subunits and thus block activity during dark conditions  <cit> . the emergence of the inhibitory subunits has been proposed as one of the events that made it possible for a higher catalytic rate to evolve in pde <dig> compared to the other pdes, resulting in a fast photoreceptor response  <cit> .

the pde <dig> holoenzyme function can be summarised as follows. the cascade is initiated by an opsin, which is activated by a photon. there are different opsins with distinct spectral selectivity mediating colour vision in various types of cones and a rhodopsin mediating dim-light vision in rods. activated opsin acts as a g nucleotide exchange factor for the heterotrimeric g-protein transducin. a gtp molecule replaces gdp at the active site of the alpha subunit of transducin leading to dissociation of the transducin heterotrimer into the activated alpha subunit and a heterodimer of the beta and gamma subunits. the alpha transducin then activates the pde <dig>  a cgmp phosphodiesterase. activation takes place when transducin alpha subunits remove the two pde <dig> inhibitory subunits  <cit> . the activated pde <dig> hydrolyses cgmp into gmp, which reduces the cgmp levels in the cell and leads to a closure of cyclic nucleotide-gated channels and hyperpolarisation of the photoreceptor cell. the regulation of activity by the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits involves specific regions within these small proteins responsible for the binding to the pde <dig> catalytic subunits and the alpha subunit of transducin but also for the stabilisation of the binding affinity, the stimulation of non-catalytic cgmp binding, the increase in cgmp exchange at the gaf domains and the stimulation of gtpase activity of transducin, in complex with rgs9- <dig>  <cit> .

in this study, an extensive repertoire of vertebrate species was used to resolve the evolutionary history of the pde <dig> subunit gene families and their chromosomal regions more precisely. this gives us a robust dataset, which demonstrates the expansion of both the catalytic and inhibitory subunit gene families in 2r as well as further duplication of the inhibitory subunit gene family in the teleost-specific whole genome duplication  as well as through local duplications. previous studies have described the same set of catalytic subunit gene repertoire in zebrafish as in human: pde6a, pde6b and pde6c  <cit> . here we demonstrate that zebrafish has retained, as a result of 3r, two paralogous genes for each of the two pde <dig> inhibitory genes found in human: pde6ga, pde6gb, pde6ha and pde6hb. additionally, we also show that zebrafish has retained an extra pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene from 2r that we named pde6i which is not present in amniotes. due to the importance of zebrafish as a model for both evolution and visual function and disorders, we have analysed the expression of all pde <dig> genes in zebrafish and found striking differences related to the adaptation to different light intensities during the day-night cycle.

RESULTS
three pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes expanded in 2r and were subsequently retained in most vertebrate lineages, with minimal to no expansion in 3r
an alignment of the pde <dig> catalytic subunit amino acid sequences used in the phylogenetic maximum likelihood  analysis is provided in additional file  <dig> and the sequence identifiers and the genomic locations of the included sequences are provided in additional file  <dig>  the phyml tree, rooted with the human pde5a and pde11a genes, of this family forms three well-supported clades with each of the human pde6a, pde6b and pde6c genes and their orthologues . all vertebrate genomes investigated have three pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes, with a few exceptions. the first exception is the green spotted pufferfish, which has two pde6c paralogs; one located on chromosome  <dig>  that clusters basally to the other teleost sequences, and the other on chromosome  <dig>  that clusters together with the nile tilapia, three-spined stickleback and medaka sequences. interestingly, two pde6c genes were also found in the fugu genome , indicating either a pufferfish-specific duplication  or that the pufferfishes have retained 3r duplicates that have been lost in other teleost fish, a scenario supported by the phylogenetic analysis . the second exception is the absence of the pde6a gene in birds and non-avian reptiles .fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree of the vertebrate pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes. the phylogenetic maximum likelihood method was used to obtain the tree, rooted with the human pde5a and pde11a sequences. the three-letter abbreviations represent species and the number or roman numeral represents chromosome, linkage group, scaffold, contig or ncbi accession number. the coloured boxes include the sequences that cluster together with the three different human pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes. a more detailed phyml tree with regard to birds and non-avian reptiles are presented in additional file 3: figure s1



we identified a single gene in the arctic lamprey  genome assembly . this gene has previously been identified in the sea lamprey  <cit> , indicating that northern hemisphere lampreys have retained only one catalytic subunit gene. the sea lamprey sequence clusters basally to all other pde <dig> catalytic subunit clusters in the phylogenetic analysis , thus we cannot confidently assign orthology to any of the gnathostome sequences. the invertebrate chordate ciona intestinalis has one gene that has been assigned the same ensembl protein family id as the vertebrate pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes. this sequence was added to the analysis for relative dating of the duplications of the vertebrate genes and it clusters basally to the three vertebrate clusters, suggesting that it is ortholog to the ancestor of the vertebrate pde6a, pde6b and pde6c genes. this is in agreement with the previously suggested expansion of this gene family in 2r, based on much fewer sequences  <cit> .

the chromosomal region housing the pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes belongs to a paralogon that arose in 2r
the human pde6a, pde6b and pde6c genes are located on chromosomes  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  respectively, like the well-studied neuropeptide y receptor genes and many neighbouring gene families. these have been previously demonstrated to have expanded in the early vertebrate tetraploidisations  <cit> . as the pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes are located some distance away from those reported previously, we analysed additional families in these regions to see whether the duplications could have taken place in the timeframe of 2r.

a total of eleven neighbouring gene families were identified as having members in the same chromosomal regions as the three pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes . three of the neighbouring gene families  were excluded at an initial stage of the analysis due to their complex phylogenetic tree topology or their multitude of members. for the remaining eight families four have annotated invertebrate and vertebrate members, dpys, ppp2r <dig>  stk <dig> and tbc1d; while the other four, ablim, afap, jakmip and sh3tc, only have vertebrate members. the sequence identifiers and genomic locations of the included neighbouring gene families are provided in additional file  <dig> 

the phylogenetic trees and the species representation of the stk <dig> gene family support an expansion in 2r giving rise to three vertebrate genes . however, teleost fish appear to have lost the stk32b. early origin of this gene is shown by its presence outside tetrapods, in the genomes of the coelacanth and the spotted gar. the phylogenetic tree of the tbc1d family shows two clusters consistent with duplication in the same timeframe as 2r . the ppp2r <dig> phylogenetic tree supports an expansion in 2r and a possible expansion of the ppp2r2a genes in the teleost specific 3r event . the phylogenetic tree of the dpys family shows six gene clusters, four of which, namely crmp <dig>  dpysl <dig>  dpysl <dig> and dpysl <dig>  seem to form a vertebrate subfamily clustering with a basal putative ciona intestinalis ortholog . this is consistent with an expansion in 2r. the topology also supports a duplication of the teleost dpysl <dig> genes in 3r. the two other gene clusters that include the human dpys and dpysl <dig> genes with their vertebrate homologs seem to have branched off from the previously mentioned vertebrate subfamily before the divergence of the lineages leading to tunicates and vertebrates.

the phylogenies of the ablim, afap, jakmip and sh3tc families show that these families expanded before the separation of lobe-finned and ray-finned vertebrates . however, if this expansion occurred due to 2r is not clear due to the lack of invertebrate family members for relative dating. the ablim family shows evidence for a duplication of both the ablim <dig> gene and the ablim <dig> gene in 3r .

a summary of the localisation of the identified neighbouring gene family genes as well as the pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes on human, chicken, spotted gar and zebrafish chromosomes are presented in fig.  <dig> fig.  <dig> conserved synteny of the chromosomal blocks carrying the pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes resulting from 2r. the figure illustrate the identified chromosomal regions harbouring the pde <dig> catalytic subunit gene family and the neighbouring gene families in human, chicken, spotted gar and zebrafish. the presence of a quartet of regions in human, chicken and spotted gar is consistent with 2r expansion resulting in a paralogon. in the zebrafish the chromosomal regions are rearranged which is consistent with chromosomal rearrangements after 3r in the teleost lineage. the families are shown in alphabetical order and each of the boxes are coloured after the chromosomal location of their human ortholog. the numbers under the boxes are the genomic locations in mega base pairs unless otherwise stated



an ancestral pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene emerged in the vertebrate ancestor and duplicated in 2r and 3r
an amino acid sequence alignment of the identified pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes is provided in additional file  <dig> and the sequence identifiers and genomic locations for the included sequences are listed in additional file  <dig>  due to the relatively high level of sequence conservation, 72–81 % between lampreys and humans , ≥64 % between human and zebrafish  and short sequence lengths, no reliable phylogenetic signal can be obtained for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes. therefore, their chromosomal locations were thoroughly investigated and used for assigning orthology. as a result, we discovered that this gene family has three paralogs  that are located in the same chromosomal regions as the somatostatin receptor  <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> genes  and the urotensin receptor genes, previously shown to reside in a paralogon  <cit> . thus, now when more genomic resources are available we can show that the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes are located in a different paralogon than the previously suggested hox paralogon  <cit> .table  <dig> amino acid sequence identity between human and zebrafish pde <dig> subunits

percentage of identity between human and zebrafish pde <dig> amino acid sequences. a comparison between the human and the zebrafish pde <dig> amino acid sequences was done in order to investigate their conservation. the calculations were done using pair-wise alignments in jalview  <dig> . shaded boxes are comparisons between orthologs



previously, only pde6g and pde6h have been described in different vertebrate species, thus our identification of pde6i reveals that this family has a third member . the three pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes were found on linkage groups   <dig>   <dig> and  <dig> of the spotted gar genome, which also carries sstr <dig>  sstr <dig> and sstr <dig> genes, respectively. a recent analysis of the eye transcriptome of the florida gar  showed that the pde6i is expressed .fig.  <dig> proposed evolutionary history and gene repertoire of the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes. important events in the evolution of this gene family 1) emergence of the ancestral pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene, before 2r. 2) loss of pde6i in the ancestor of amniotes. 3) loss of the second intron of the coding region of the putative pde6h 3r duplicates. 4) local duplication of one of the pde6h 3r duplicates. 5) loss of the first intron of the coding region in one of the pde6h 3r duplicates. small arrowheads represent stop codons or frame shift mutations in the coding sequence. the orthology assignment of the genes was done according to conservation of synteny and exon-intro organisation. the column to the right shows identified genes whose assignment was not possible



the coelacanth has three different pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes in its genome assembly, one fragmented , one full length  and one that appears to be a pseudogene due to a frame-shift mutation in the first exon disrupting the translation  . the western clawed frog has four full-length and one fragmented pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes all located on different genomic scaffolds. we could confidently assign the identity as pde6g and pde6i for two of the frog genes , whereas the others did not share synteny with any of the spotted gar chromosomal regions carrying a pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene .

we identified orthologs for pde6g and pde6h in the teleost species investigated but only zebrafish and mexican cave tetra has retained pde6i . most of the teleost species investigated have retained putative 3r duplicates for pde6h, while only zebrafish and medaka have retained 3r paralogs for pde6g  . the teleost pde6h genes have experienced intron loss at different time points during teleost evolution. the zebrafish and mexican cave tetra have lost the first intron of the coding region in the pde6ha gene , thus it probably took place in their common ancestor. the other investigated teleosts have lost the last intron of the coding region in their pde6h genes . these intron losses along with the conservation of synteny allowed assignment of orthology of the teleost pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes. for the complete repertoire of the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes identified in teleost genomes see fig.  <dig>  for synteny comparisons of teleost scaffolds or chromosomes with pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes to spotted gar linkage groups, see additional file 3: figures s11-s <dig> 

the pde6i gene could not be identified in the elephant shark  or in amniotes. in chicken, the pde6g and pde6h genes are located close to the sstr <dig> gene on chromosome  <dig> and sstr <dig> on chromosome  <dig>  respectively. the human pde6g gene is located on chromosome  <dig> as is the sstr <dig> gene. in contrast, the human pde6h gene on chromosome  <dig> is not located on the same chromosome as the sstr <dig> gene, which is located on chromosome  <dig> . however, the opossum pde6h gene is located on the same chromosome as the sstr <dig> gene, chromosome  <dig>  which suggests that a translocation of pde6h took place in the primate lineage.

lampreys are a special case. two pde <dig> inhibitory subunit sequences have previously been cloned in the sea lamprey: genbank accession number abo <dig>  and ncbi accession number abo <dig>   <cit> . due to the lack of synteny data we could not assign their orthology to the other vertebrate genes . in the arctic lamprey genome we could only identify sequence fragments: one first exon, one middle exon and three last exons, all located on different scaffolds or contigs that prevented us to assign any orthology.

in order to analyse the evolutionary origin of these genes, we performed tblastn searches in all invertebrate genomes present in the ncbi whole genome shotgun reference database, using the human pde6g and pde6h amino acid sequences as templates. we also performed nhmmer searches in the invertebrate genomes present in table  <dig>  despite these efforts, not a single homologous sequence for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes was identified in invertebrates.table  <dig> list of the species used in this study

comparison of zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit paralog sequences reveal highly conserved regions
using zebrafish as a model, we investigated the possible specialisations of the pde <dig> subunit genes; pde6a, pde6b and pde6c for the catalytic subunits and the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes retained after 3r; pde6ga, pde6gb, pde6ha and pde6hb. a comparison of the amino acid sequence identity between human and zebrafish for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits confirmed high level of conservation: human pde6g shares 75 % and 93 % identity with zebrafish pde6ga and pde6gb, respectively; while human pde6h displays approximately 70 % identity with both zebrafish pde6ha and pde6hb .

additionally, an amino acid sequence alignment of the human and zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit sequences showed some differences in each gene, but the regions that are known to be involved in specific functions, previously described in  <cit> , are highly conserved . some exceptions were observed, like an asparagine instead of threonine at position  <dig> in pde6ga, a phenylalanine instead of a tyrosine at position  <dig> in human pde6h and one alteration that could have a functional effect in the pde6i carrying a glutamic acid instead of the lysine at position  <dig> . these results, together with the gene expression data provided in the sections that follow, suggest that the specialisations did not involve any neofunctionalisation at the protein structure level.fig.  <dig> alignment of the human and zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit amino acid sequences. the alignment was made using clustalws and manually curated. black boxes represent the residues necessary for the function indicated by the different colours. information about the function of different regions was retrieved from fig.  <dig> in  <cit> 



the percentage of identity for the 3′utr sequences of the zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes were analysed in order to find regions suitable for use in the design of probes able to distinguish between the 3r duplicates. we found that, pde6ga and pde6gb share 48 % nucleotide sequence identity, pde6ha and pde6hb share 59 %, and pde6i shares between 48–52 % identity with the others .

the zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene paralogs are expressed in the same cell types as their amniote orthologs
the expression pattern of the three pde <dig> catalytic subunit genes present in zebrafish, has been previously reported  <cit> . in this investigation, we have analysed the expression levels for all zebrafish pde <dig> genes by qrt-pcr, as well as the expression pattern of the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes; pde6ga, pde6gb, pde6ha, pde6hb and pde6i, by in situ hybridisation . pde6i was excluded from the ish experiments due to the extremely low expression levels found in adult eyes .

there is a strikingly different morphology of the outer retina between day and night due to the retinomotor movements, previously described in several species, including zebrafish  <cit> . interestingly, both the intensity and the location of the staining observed for the four studied genes were substantially different in retinae from animals sacrificed in the afternoon  versus the middle of the night . due to this, the photoreceptor naming will be done only in the day retinae . ish experiments revealed staining only in photoreceptor cells, throughout the entire retina. expression of pde6ga  and pde6gb  were observed in the myoid and cytoplasm surrounding the nuclei of rods. staining in the ssc seems to be present in a´-a´´ and b´-b´´ and we cannot discard that pde6ga and pde6gb are expressed in rods and also ssc. however, if true, this will not be in the entire retina . expression of pde6ha  and pde6hb  was observed in all cones. the yellowish colour observed in 5g´´ could suggest double staining; however its absence in the day retina, combined with the around  <dig> fold lower expression levels  and the loose morphology of the night retinae led us to conclude that this is just an artefact. additionally, double ish experiments revealed coexpression of pde6ga and pde6gb in rods  and pde6ha and pde6hb in cones , throughout the retina. expression of the four genes was also observed in the pineal complex  without noticeable differences between day and night . however, to reveal any differential expression in the pineal complex, qrt-pcr must be performed.fig.  <dig> expression pattern of the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes in the adult zebrafish retina and pineal complex. photomicrographs from ish experiments on adult tg <dig> zebrafish showing staining for pde6ga, pde6bg, pde6ha and pde6hb in the retina at 17:00 pm  and at 4:00 am , and also in the pineal complex . the upper row shows efgp fluorescence  in rods , the second row from the top shows the ish experiments stained with fast red , , the second from the bottom is a merge of the two previous  and the bottom row shows ish stained with nbt/bcip . dapi, in blue, stains cell nuclei in all fluorescent photomicrographs. stricken morphological differences, due to the retinomotor movements, can be observed in the retina between day and night, graphically represented by the contraction of the ros from the outermost layer at daytime  to inner locations at night . this makes very difficult the cell assignment in the night retinae, so it was shown only in the day retinae . staining for pde6ga  and pde6gb  can be observed in rod inner segments and for pde6ha  and pde6hb  in cones. staining for all four genes was observed in adult pineal complex . in a´-a´´ and b´-b´´, staining in the ssc seems to be present, therefore, we cannot discard that pde6ga and pde6gb are expressed in rods and ssc. in addition, the yellowish colour observed in 5g´´ could suggest double staining; however its absence in the day retina, combined with the about  <dig> fold lower expression levels and the loose morphology of the night retinae led us to conclude that this is just an artefact. abbreviations: d; diencephalon, conl; cone outer nuclear layer, cos; cone outer segments, opl; outer plexiform layer, ronl; rod outer nuclear layer, ros; rod outer segments. arrows point at dc, arrowheads to lsc, empty arrowheads to ssc and empty arrows to rods´ myoids. in i-l, arrows point at the pineal complex. scale bars; in a is 20 μm for a-d´´, in e is 20 μm for e-h´´ and in i is 30 μm for i-l

in addition to the analyses on adults, ontogenetic analyses using 1– <dig> dpf larvae were performed by whole-mount ish . the results reveal a synchronised onset of expression in the pineal complex at  <dig> dpf for all genes, except pde6ha that starts at  <dig> dpf, and delayed onset of expression for all of them until around 2– <dig> dpf in the retina . the expression in the retina starts in the ventral part, in accordance with the differentiation process that starts in this region in zebrafish, different to most vertebrates, in which it is initiated in central locations  <cit> .

the zebrafish pde <dig> inhibitory subunit paralogs show differential oscillatory patterns in expression levels for both rods and cones in adult retinae
qrt-pcr experiments were performed to analyse the expression levels of all zebrafish pde <dig> genes in adult eyes from animals collected at six different time points during 24 h. the results were normalised to the mean of the housekeeping genes , previously reported to be appropriate for gene expression analysis in zebrafish  <cit> . for detailed p-values see additional file 3: table s <dig>  amplification of pde6i gene started between cq  <dig> and  <dig>  when using ten times higher amount of adult eye cdna template  for the 5 p.m. time point, indicating low expression levels. pde6i expression levels were also investigated in 3dpf, 6dpf and 10dpf embryos, showing amplification between cq  <dig> and  <dig>  either using 10 ng or 50 ng of cdna per reaction. additionally, when searching zebrafish est sequences using tblastn with the mrna sequence for pde6i , no identical sequences were found. therefore, pde6i was excluded from expression pattern analyses.

in rods , significant  but minor oscillations in gene expression  were observed over 24 h for the 2r duplicates pde6a and pde6b, which code for the rod-specific catalytic subunits. interestingly, the 3r paralogs pde6ga and pde6gb, which code for the inhibitory subunits, behave quite differently: pde6ga has the highest expression in the early morning , after a constant ~ <dig> fold increase since late evening . its expression decreases rapidly in the morning , to levels comparable to pde6a . the expression levels of pde6gb also oscillate, but differently in time and levels: its highest expression is early at night , after a quick ~ <dig> fold increase since late evening . after 24: <dig>  its expression diminishes until noon . during the day, there is a fairly constant expression for both paralogs; pde6gb being ~ <dig> fold higher than pde6ga.fig.  <dig> day-night variation in relative expression levels of pde <dig> genes in zebrafish. double plots of mean relative expression over 24 h for rod-  and cone-specific  pde <dig> genes. a the levels of pde6a and pde6b do not vary, while for pde6ga there is a drastic difference between day and night, being its highest expression levels in the early morning , after a constant expression increase during the night. small variation was observed for pde6gb levels, being its highest levels at early night . b the expression levels of pde6c do not vary, while there is a ~ <dig> fold variation for pde6hb between day and night, being its expression peak in the early morning  with a gradual reduction during the day. the variation for pde6ha is more drastic; there is a peak of expression in the middle of the day  and a subsequent ~ <dig> fold reduction until the middle of the night . expression levels for each gene are relative to the mean of zebrafish actb <dig> and tuba1b  and error bars represent standard deviations. shaded areas represent the dark period of a 24-h cycle. note that both graphs are at different scales in order to be able to visualise the high expression levels of pde6ha during the day



in cones  the pde6c gene, which codes for the catalytic subunit, shows a minor oscillation in its expression during the day , with a significant peak of expression in the early morning  . however, this oscillation is minimal compared to the oscillation in the expression pde6ha, coding for an inhibitory subunit, which gradually increases its expression  from the middle of the night  to reaching its peak in the evening , to decrease again after 17: <dig>  an oscillation of ~ <dig> fold in the expression of pde6hb was also observed, increasing expression during the night  and decreasing during the day  .

discussion
this report describes the evolutionary history of all pde <dig> genes as deduced from analyses of a wide range of vertebrate genomes. a résumé of their evolution, including the number and type of genes present in each vertebrate group, is shown in fig.  <dig>  in addition, zebrafish was used as a model to investigate the possible sub- or neofunctionalisations of pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene 3r paralogs.fig.  <dig> phylogenetic tree summarizing the evolution of the pde <dig> genes in vertebrates. the figure illustrates the expansion of the pde <dig> catalytic  and inhibitory  gene families during vertebrate evolution and shows the approximate divergence times of species included in the analyses. no representative for any of these gene families were found in amphioxus. the ancestral pde <dig> catalytic subunit gene appeared in the common ancestor of tunicates  and vertebrates. on the contrary, the ancestral pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene appeared in the common ancestor of all vertebrates, after the split from tunicates. both gene families expanded in 2r and were subsequently subjected to losses resulting in triplets for the catalytic  and the inhibitory subunit genes . in the sea lamprey, additional losses occurred resulting in one catalytic subunit gene and two inhibitory subunit genes. similarly, one inhibitory subunit gene  was lost in cartilaginous fish  and amniotes . in non-amniote lobe-finned fish  and ray-finned fish , all three pde <dig> catalytic and three pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes are preserved. teleost fish retained extra duplicates for some of the inhibitory subunit genes after 3r, as well as from local duplications. finally, pde6a was lost in the lineage leading to birds and non-avian reptiles. for consistency purposes, the colour code for the gene boxes is the same as used in figs.  <dig>   <dig>  additional file 3: figures s1-s <dig>  empty white boxes means that the orthology assignment could not be done confidently and boxes with an asterisk indicates fragmented sequences



the pde <dig> catalytic subunit gene repertoire is well conserved within the subphylum vertebrata
the phylogenetic analysis of the pde <dig> catalytic subunit gene family and our data on conserved synteny  support an expansion in 2r for this gene family . the three-gene repertoire  is well conserved across vertebrates, with the exception of northern hemisphere lampreys, that have only one gene and reptiles and birds that lack pde6a. additionally, the teleost-specific genome doubling did not result in any extra duplicates in this gene family, with the possible exception of the pufferfishes, which have an additional pde6c.

within the phototransduction cascade, our group has previously reported similar cases of gene repertoire conservation for the visual opsin gene family  <cit>  and the alpha transducin gene family  <cit> . altogether, these results reflect the high degree of conservation of the catalytic function, with no or little selection pressure to retain 3r duplicates; there might even have been selection against their retention.

functionally, the three pde <dig> catalytic subunits have similar catalytic activity and interaction with the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits  <cit> . the difference is the efficiency of activation by transducin, in that rod pde <dig> is activated much less efficiently than cone pde <dig>  <cit> . the lack of a pde6a gene in birds and non-avian reptiles could be explained by a loss in their common ancestor before the divergence of these lineages. such a gene loss would be in line with a previous study of the chicken retina  <cit>  which suggests that chicken uses a pde6ββ homodimer instead of the pde6αβ heterodimer commonly used by other vertebrates  <cit> .

the appearance of an inhibitory subunit that regulates the pde <dig> activity facilitated the success of the vertebrate visual system
the absence of pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes in invertebrates and their location in the sstr <dig>   <dig>   <dig> and utsr paralogon  <cit> , has led us to propose the following scenario for the evolution of this gene family. an ancestral pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene emerged de novo in the vertebrate lineage closely before 1r facilitating the shutting off of the pde <dig> enzyme during dark conditions  <cit> . the appearance of de novo genes from non-coding genomic regions has been suggested to be important mechanism contributing to the origin of genes, where they can evolve important and even essential functions rapidly  <cit> . subsequently, this gene was quadrupled in 2r followed by a loss of one of the four resulting genes.

within gnathostomes, we here show for the first time that actinopterygians and non-amniote sarcopterygians have retained a third gene, that we named pde6i to mark its paralogous relationship with pde6g and pde6h. we also found extra duplicates of pde6g and pde6h in teleosts, both resulting from 3r and through local duplications. in zebrafish we found that both the pde6g and pde6h genes have retained 3r duplicates. we have named the genes pde6ga, pde6gb, pde6ha and pde6hb. additionally, zebrafish has the pde6i gene for which we detected very low expression in adult eyes and whole embryos up to  <dig> dpf, therefore we suggest that it might not have a function or, in adults, it is expressed in another organ.

the different intron losses that occurred in the pde6h genes within teleosts can be the result of incomplete retrotranscription of the mrna or retrotranscription of a partially spliced pre-mrna, followed by replacement of the gene resulting in loss of one or more introns  <cit> . similar processes has been observed in many genes . it has been observed that the hatching enzyme genes with the highest expression levels are more prone to intron loss  <cit> . this is in line with our analyses that the expression of the pde6ha gene is much higher than the other genes .

among non-amniote sarcopterygians, we found pde6i in the western clawed frog and the coelacanth. in coelacanth pde6i has probably been pseudogenised due to a frame-shift mutation that disrupts normal translation. however, due to the high overall sequence conservation of the coelacanth gene, the mutation is either recent or due to a sequencing error.

the sea lamprey genome assembly  has low coverage  and is based on somatic cell dna. this poses a problem because it is known that the lamprey genome goes through programmed loss of large amounts  of somatic dna in different cell lineages during embryonic development  <cit> . thus, genes might be present in the genome but missing in the genome assembly. when searching the germline genome assembly of the arctic lamprey we found fragmented pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene sequences. the lifestyle of the northern hemisphere lampreys, mostly in pelagic and benthic waters  <cit> , probably has led to losses in genes related to vision. thus, to fully understand the visual gene repertoire, a genome assembly from a southern hemisphere lamprey, such as geotria australis, living predominantly in surface waters  <cit>  and known to have retained all ancestral subtypes of visual opsins  <cit> , is needed.

what did the visual system of zebrafish gain by retaining pde <dig> inhibitory subunit duplicates after 3r?
the retention of duplicated genes may have two possible outcomes; subfunctionalisation, whereby the functions and/or expression of the ancestral gene are partitioned between the duplicates, or neofunctionalisation, whereby one or both of the copies gain novel functions  <cit> .

here we demonstrate that the paralogs retained after 3r in zebrafish for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits, pde6ga, pde6gb, pde6ha and pde6hb, did not undergo subfunctionalisation involving topographical or temporal specialisations during development, i.e. the four genes are expressed in the retina and the pineal complex from early development. instead, both paralogous pairs are coexpressed in the same retinal photoreceptor cell types as their amniote orthologs; pde6ga and pde6gb in rods and pde6ha and pde6hb in cones. an exception could be the ssc  which possess some rod-like physiology features  that could explain the possible expression of the four pde <dig> inhibitory subunits, in addition to the previously suggested gnb1a and gnb1b  <cit>  and rcv1a  <cit> . further analyses are planned to be conducted in this sense in order to solve the transcriptome of each zebrafish cone type.

we also observed a striking difference in expression levels between day and night. altogether, the high sequence identity, coexpression and different expression levels of the paralogs led us to consider neofunctionalisation as unlikely to have happened. instead we suggest that the overall regulatory function by the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits of the phototransduction cascade is most likely maintained, while specialisation of one or several of mechanisms of this regulation may be affected  <cit> , with a direct effect on gene expression levels.

similar coexpression in rods of paralogs involved in the phototransduction cascade has also been found for the gnb1a and gnb1b transducin subunit genes  <cit>  and has been suggested for the arrsa and arrsb arrestin genes  <cit>  and the grk1a and grk1b opsin gpcr kinase genes  <cit> . additionally, subfunctionalisation of the zebrafish cone-specific arrestins has been reported previously: arr3a expressed in double cones and arr3b in single cones  <cit> . the current study shows a case of retention of two 3r paralogs in all cones similarly to the recently reported recoverin genes  <cit>  which also might have been duplicated in 3r.

altogether, zebrafish has retained several 3r duplicates of phototransduction cascade components that are coexpressed in the same photoreceptor cell types, indicating a dosage effect in regulation of the visual function. in this article, we show that the coexpression of pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes, inhibiting the main effector of the phototransduction cascade, is subfunctionalised by showing a daily oscillation in gene expression .

the pineal complex of non-mammalian vertebrates has rod- and cone-like photoreceptor cells  <cit> . the expression of the four pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes in the pineal complex agrees with previous observations of the presence of several other components of the phototransduction cascade . altogether, their expression further supports the idea that the pinealocytes share a common origin with the retinal photoreceptors  <cit> . however, the functional role for these duplicated genes remains unclear.

the onset of expression for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes is earlier in the pineal complex than in the retina, similar to other components of the teleost phototransduction cascade like opsins , transducins  <cit>  or cyclic nucleotide gated channels   and recoverins  <cit> . this is in accordance with the involvement of the pineal complex in regulation of hatching in atlantic halibut  <cit> . the delay of expression in the retina is consistent with previous reports that have shown the zebrafish retina to be responsive to light stimuli around  <dig> dpf  <cit> .

opposite rhythmic oscillations in expression for the pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes are related to differential light sensitivity
circadian changes in the zebrafish and cichlid retinae have been previously reported regarding morphology  <cit> , gene expression  <cit>  and physiology  <cit> . how those circadian changes influence visual function is not well understood. here we describe gene expression data of regulatory genes that are likely to directly influence the sensitivity to light.

zebrafish have been reported to show circadian oscillations in visual sensitivity  <cit> , which can be partially explained by the striking morphological differences between day and night in the outer retina  <cit> ; rod outer segments  are located in outer locations during the day and move inwards at night, while cone outer segments  are located in the innermost outer retina during the day and move outwards at night . these retinomotor movements, present in most vertebrate groups except mammals  <cit> , facilitate an optimal light exposure for each photoreceptor type at the different light conditions, which increases their sensitivity, albeit losing resolution at night  <cit> .fig.  <dig> retinomotor movements in the zebrafish retina. photomicrographs of adult zebrafish retinae showing morphological differences between day  and night . in the upper row, bight field photomicrographs taken using nomarski contrast show the clear stratification during daytime , different to the poorly stratified retina at night . in both pictures, fast red staining, in pink, shows the presence of pde6ga mrnas in rods. note the different intensity in staining, confirmed by qrt-pcr as higher expression at 4:00 am . c-f pictures are fluorescence photomicrographs of immunostainings illustrating the retinomotor movements with photoreceptor-specific markers. in c and d, sections of a transgenic line that expresses egfp in cones: tg were incubated with a rod-specific anti-gnb <dig> antibody . in e and f, sections of a transgenic line that expresses egfp in rods: tg <dig> were incubated with a double cone-specific anti-zpr <dig> antibody . in both cases, note the position of the rod outer segments in the outermost part of the retina at daytime, while at night they have moved to inner positions and the cone outer segments have moved outwards. dapi was used as a nuclei counterstain . rpe: retinal pigment epithelium. for more abbreviations, see fig.  <dig> legend. scale bar is 20 μm



putting together data about phototransduction cascade proteins, cone opsins  <cit>  and pde6ha  have their highest expression in the late afternoon, when the cones mediating photopic vision have high sensitivity  <cit> . the cone transducin levels, on the contrary, do not oscillate significantly . high levels of opsins would increase sensitivity while pde6ha would be a key factor for the non-saturating effect, exclusive for cones  <cit> , tentatively by the binding of the excess of free pde <dig> inhibitory subunits to activated alpha transducins in a desensitisation-like effect. for scotopic vision, rhodopsin  and rod transducin  <cit>  expression levels do not oscillate significantly, while expression of both pde6g paralogs is higher in rods at night, where dim-light conditions activate rods.

oscillations in the expression of opsins have been reported in teleosts  <cit> , frog  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> , mice  <cit> , the sudanian grass rat  <cit>  with no obvious common denominator among all these results. these circadian changes in gene expression have been attributed to the circadian cycle of outer segment disc shedding of the photoreceptors  <cit>  or correlated with behavioural sensitivity to light  <cit> . this is the first report showing gene expression oscillations in a phototransduction cascade protein except opsins. similarly, oscillations in gene expression has been observed for the interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein, a gene specific for photoreceptors but not strictly phototransduction cascade related protein, in both zebrafish  <cit>  and chicken  <cit> .

in this study we investigated the mrna expression pattern and expression levels due to the difficulty to generate specific antibodies able to target the 3r paralogs. therefore, we have to assume that there is no or little delay in the translation of proteins or in the trafficking to and throughout the outer segment. contrarily, it has been previously reported that transducin is stored in the photoreceptor inner segments in rats before being transported to the outer segments during the night  <cit> . however, this has not been demonstrated in other species or for other proteins of the phototransduction cascade  <cit> . in order to investigate the light-dependence of the pde <dig> inhibitory subunits oscillations in gene expression levels and its effect on visual sensitivity, our group has initiated functional and semi-functional studies.

CONCLUSIONS
we report here that both catalytic and inhibitory subunit gene families of pde <dig> were duplicated in 2r, resulting in cone- and rod-specific copies. together with duplications of several other gene families expressed in the eye  <cit>  this emphasises further the importance of 2r for vertebrate evolution in general and particularly for vision. the 2r event facilitated the differentiation of rods and cones by subfunctionalisation and/or neofunctionalisation of gene duplicates. additionally, we report that the important regulatory pde <dig> inhibitory subunit genes seem to have arisen in conjunction with the origin of the vertebrates, shortly before the genome quadruplication in 2r, presumably facilitating the rapid regulation of visual responses of the vertebrate eye mediated by the pde <dig> enzyme. after 2r, the inhibitory subunit gene duplicates became specialised on rods and cones, respectively, and a third ancient copy presumably acquired distinct functions and still exists in some vertebrate lineages, although not amniotes. finally, we show that the 3r-generated pde <dig> inhibitory subunit gene duplicates evolved dramatically different daily expression profiles in zebrafish. thus, the pde <dig> inhibitory gene duplicates display novel specialisations that warrant further functional experiments.
