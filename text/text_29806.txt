BACKGROUND
the conifer family cupressaceae contains many remarkable and important trees including junipers, redwoods, sequoias, cypresses, and thujas  <cit> . one cupressaceae species that is of tremendous ecological importance to the southeastern u.s. is bald cypress, taxodium distichum  rich var. distichum  <cit> . bald cypress is the cornerstone species in the aptly named "cypress swamps" where it serves as a source of food and shelter for numerous and sundry organisms  <cit> . though native to the u.s. south, bald cypress is a popular ornamental throughout much of the world; indeed, it has been cultivated in europe since at least the mid 17th century  <cit> . bald cypress wood is extremely resistant to wind, water, pathogens, and pests, something that perhaps is not surprising when one considers that individual trees may spend their entire life  partially submerged in water. the highly durable wood of bald cypress is used in construction of boats, docks, bridges, and roofing shingles  <cit> , although the tree's relatively slow growth-rate has limited its use as a wood crop. unlike most conifers, bald cypress is deciduous with leaves that change from light green to brown in the fall. its attractive appearance and hardiness have made it a popular ornamental throughout the eastern u.s.  <cit> .

the genus taxodium consists of one to three extant species, depending upon taxonomic preference. the most conservative treatment places all trees in a single species  with three varieties; specifically bald cypress , pond cypress , and montezuma bald cypress . while the single species treatment is phylogenetically warranted  <cit> , sociological reasons have kept the multi-species nomenclature in place - e.g., montezuma bald cypress is the national tree of mexico  <cit> .

the bald cypress 1c dna content is  <dig> mb  <cit>  which places it amongst the smallest of conifer genomes  <cit> . bald cypress possesses 2n = 2x =  <dig> chromosomes  <cit>  and is a diploid like most members of the cupressaceae  <cit> .

taxodium has not been the subject of molecular mapping and/or est sequencing. in the cupressaceae, molecular research has largely focused on cryptomeria japonica, and molecular maps based upon est, rflp, rapd, and isozyme markers exist for this species  <cit> . however, these genetic maps cover only a small part of the entire cryptomeria genome.

to advance understanding of taxodium and the cupressaceae in general, we utilized three experimental tools. specifically:

 cot analysis - the study of dna reassociation kinetics in solution is known as cot analysis  <cit> . it is one of the earliest means of studying genome structure predating cloning and dna sequencing techniques by several years . cot analysis is based upon the observation that the product of dna concentration , reassociation time , and a "buffer factor" accounting for cation concentration  has a predictable effect on the amount of reassociation occurring in a denatured dna sample  <cit> . the major unknown factor influencing reassociation is the underlying sequence composition of the dna. consequently, one can indirectly study genome sequence composition by exploring how changes in c0tÎ´  influence reassociation. typically, a graph is created in which the fraction of reassociated dna is plotted against the logarithm of cot . the resulting scatter plot is analyzed using nonlinear regression analysis, and a least-squares curve is fit through the data. this graph, known as a cot curve, provides a visual representation of the genome. analysis of cot data provides the number of kinetic components in a genome, the reassociation rate  of each component, the fraction of the genome found in each component, the kinetic complexity  of each component, and each component's average sequence iteration. additionally, in some instances the genome size of an organism can also be estimated through comparison of the k value for the single/low copy component of the organism of interest with the k and genome size of e. coli  <cit> .

 cot filtration  - cf represents a merger between cot analysis and high-throughput dna sequencing  <cit> . in short, the results of a cot curve are used to guide fractionation of a genome into its kinetic components, and isolated components are sequenced in full or part. the value of cf and other reduced-representation sequencing techniques lies in their ability to enrich for subsets of genomic dna of interest  <cit> . since the majority of genes are single/low-copy in nature, cf has been used to enrich for gene space including the promoters and introns missed by cdna approaches  <cit> . alternatively, sequencing of a highly repetitive component represents a means of efficiently exploring the repetitive landscape of a genome  <cit> .

 bac library analysis - bacterial artificial chromosomes  have been the most popular large-insert cloning vectors for nearly  <dig> years  <cit> , and ordered bac libraries  remain highly useful tools in modern genomics research  <cit> . one can efficiently map molecular markers to corresponding bacs via multiplex macroarray hybridization techniques or by using multiplex pcr strategies  <cit> . by combining macroarray/pcr mapping data with data from bac end sequencing, dna fingerprinting, and/or sequencing of bac pools, one can generate highly accurate physical  maps and identify minimum bac tiling paths representing whole or nearly whole chromosomes  <cit> . though construction of bac minimum tiling paths will likely become less important as dna sequencing becomes cheaper and faster, bac libraries will likely remain a key means of bridging gaps and resolving anomalies in shotgun sequence-based scaffolds  <cit> .

the bald cypress bac library generated in this study affords  <dig>  genome equivalent coverage of the bald cypress genome. though bac libraries exist for several pinaceae conifers  <cit> , to our knowledge the bald cypress bac library is the first constructed for a cupressaceae species. the library was shown to be useful in gene isolation and genome characterization. the cot and cf-based repeat analyses suggest that highly diverged, low-copy repeats account for much of bald cypress' genomic dna.

RESULTS
cot analysis
the cotquest  <cit>  nonlinear regression model providing the best fit of the renaturation kinetics data was a three-component fit in which outliers had been removed  and the reassociation rate  of the slowest reassociating component had been fixed based upon the genome size of bald cypress. this best fit cot curve is shown in figure  <dig> while the major biological characteristics obtained from curve analysis are shown in table  <dig>  of note, the curve is composed of highly repetitive , moderately repetitive , and single/low-copy  components accounting for  <dig> ,  <dig> , and  <dig> % of the genome, respectively. because the best fit was obtained when the reassociation rate of the sl component was fixed based upon genome size, the curve cannot be used to produce an estimate of dna content. assuming that the sl component has a repetition frequency of  <dig>  the average repetition frequency of the dna in other components can be estimated by dividing their k values by the k value of the sl component  <cit> . the mean predicted repetition frequencies of sequences in the mr and hr components are  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

akncx = kinetic complexity

bmrf = mean repetition frequency

for each component, 80% of the sequences in that component will reassociate in the "two cot decade region"  flanking the component's cot1/ <dig> value, i.e., if a component's cot1/ <dig> is y, then 80% of sequences can be found between  <dig> y and 10y. because k  can be directly related to sequence copy number, one can use the tcdr to predict the range in sequence iteration for 80% of the sequences in a particular component. for example, the bald cypress mr component has a mean repeat frequency of  <dig> while 80% of the mr sequences are repeated from  <dig>  to  <dig> times. likewise, for the hr component which has a mean repetition frequency of  <dig>  80% of elements in the component have iteration frequencies between  <dig>  and  <dig> .

cot filtration
 <dig> high-quality hr capillary sequence reads were analyzed using the sequence read classification pipeline  of chouvarine et al.  <cit> . as shown in figure  <dig>  the vast majority of reads  showed no obvious  homology to previously characterized repeat sequences, gene sequences, and/or each other. chloroplast dna, rdna, and "probable repeats"  each account for about 6-8% of the hr reads. only  <dig> % of sequenced hr sequences shared significant sequence identity with known mobile elements.

the program must  <cit>  was used to identify potential miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements  in the hr sequences. mites are non-autonomous dna elements characterized by terminal-inverted repeats, target-site duplications , and an internal region with no coding sequence  <cit> . those potential mites found in sequence reads classified as "unknown" or "probable repeats" by the srcp are provided in additional file  <dig>  using the criteria described in the materials and methods,  <dig> potential mites were identified. the mean mite length was  <dig> bp, the mean direct repeat length was  <dig>  bp, and the mean terminal-inverted repeat length was  <dig>  bp.

bac library construction and characterization
the bald cypress bac library consists of  <dig>  individually-archived clones in  <dig> 384-well microtiter plates. the library was given the designation tdd_ba in accordance with the library naming standards used by the mississippi genome exploration laboratory , the clemson university genomics institute , and the arizona genomics institute . the library and its associated products are distributed by mgel .

periodically during bac library construction, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis analysis was used to check the insert size of randomly-selected noti-digested bacs. inserts ranged in size from  <dig> kb to  <dig> kb , and the mean insert size for the library was  <dig> kb . the origin of the bac insert dnas was confirmed by southern hybridization using radiolabeled bald cypress genomic dna as a probe. as shown in figure 3c, there is considerable variation in hybridization intensity between bac inserts  that cannot be accounted for by differences in dna amount per lane . those clones with the strongest hybridization signals ostensibly contain more repetitive dna than those with weaker signals.

approximately  <dig> % of clones in the library were false positives . the proportion of false positive clones was greater earlier in library construction - e.g., the first  <dig> plates had a false positive percentage of  <dig>  while the remaining  <dig> plates had a false positive percentage of  <dig> . the addition of a "pre-electrophoresis" size-selection step  was likely responsible for the reduced number of false positives in the latter three-fifths of the library.

the level of chloroplast dna contamination in the library was estimated by macroarray hybridization. four loblolly pine  sequences representing different regions of the chloroplast genome  <cit>  were used to probe five  <dig> Ã  <dig> double-spotted bald cypress macroarrays. we found that  <dig>  inserts of the  <dig>  taxodium clones represented on the macroarrays contained chloroplast dna. this is the highest level of chloroplast contamination for any plant bac library we have constructed, but still within the range of reported values .

while macroarray screening with mitochondrial dna was not performed, sequencing of nuclear dna prepared using our nuclear dna isolation protocol suggests that mitochondrial dna contamination is  <dig> to  <dig> times less frequent than contamination from chloroplast dna .

after subtracting the fractions of false positive clones and chloroplast dna-containing clones, the number of clones containing bald cypress nuclear dna was estimated to be  <dig> . thus the fraction of clones in the library containing nuclear dna was  <dig>  , and the number of nuclear dna-containing clones on each macroarray was determined to be  <dig>  . using the average insert size of  <dig> kb, the library contains approximately  <dig>  genome equivalents of bald cypress nuclear dna . this level of genome equivalent coverage affords a  <dig> % chance that a particular genomic sequence of interest will be found at least once in a library .

to further assess the quality and the utility of the library, eight t. distichum var. distichum single-copy gene sequences, employed previously in molecular phylogenetics research  <cit> , were used to screen five  <dig> Ã  <dig> macroarrays. the five macroarrays collectively represented  <dig>   genome equivalents of bald cypress nuclear dna. the gene sequences  were used to design pcr primers and/or overgo probes for each gene , and macroarrays were separately screened with a pool containing the radiolabeled overgos and a pool containing the radiolabeled pcr amplicons. as shown in table  <dig>  the average number of positive clones recognized by a probe was  <dig>  for the overgo pool and  <dig>  for the amplicon pool. to verify the utility of the library in gene isolation, positive clones 1069i <dig>  1052c <dig> and 1137o <dig> were spotted onto nylon membranes and probed with various combinations of the overgo probes for the chi <dig>  ferr, pat, hema and lcyb genes. the results of these dot-blot hybridizations revealed that clones 1069i <dig>  1052c <dig>  and 1137o <dig> contained the chi <dig>  hema, and pat genes , respectively.

cclone addresses are composed of a plate number, a row letter, and a column number, e.g., 1052n <dig> is the clone found in plate  <dig>  row n, column  <dig> 

da dot-blot experiment verified that clones 1052n <dig>  1069h <dig>  and 1137o <dig> contained the hema, chi <dig>  and pat genes, respectively. specific clone/probe relationships were not determined for the other clones.

library screening with repetitive sequences of bald cypress
for estimation of repetitive dna content, blots prepared from pulsed-field gels of random noti-digested bac clones were probed with radiolabeled cot â¤  <dig> mÂ·s  dna. based on the cot data, cot- <dig> dna should contain sequences repeated, on average,  <dig> times. among the  <dig> clones on the various southern blots,  <dig> showed obvious hybridization signals using the cot- <dig> probe, i.e., approximately  <dig> % of the bac clones in the library appear to have inserts containing repetitive elements found hundreds to thousands of times in the genome .

to study the distribution of a particular retroelement in the taxodium genome, a  <dig> Ã  <dig> macroarray was screened with an overgo probe  designed from a bald cypress hr cot-filtered sequence  with high sequence identity  to two gingko biloba copia-like retroelement reverse transcriptase sequences . of the  <dig>  nuclear dna-containing clones on the macroarray,  <dig>  exhibited hybridization to the overgo which represents a reverse transcriptase gene we have deemed tdcrt <dig> for taxodium distichum copia-like reverse transcriptase  <dig> . densitometer analysis of the macroarray suggests that tdcrt <dig> is found in roughly  <dig>  copies in the bald cypress genome. an initial glance at tdcrt <dig> hybridization to macroarrays suggests that the element is found in clusters, i.e., it is not distributed randomly throughout the genome. to test this hypothesis, we used the probabilistic "urn model" method of holst  <cit>  as detailed in shan et al.  <cit> . using an average bac insert size of  <dig> kb, an estimated  <dig>  nuclear dna-containing clones per macroarray, and a genome size of  <dig> mb, we calculated that each macroarray represents about  <dig> x coverage of the taxodium genome . thus one would predict that one macroarray should contain  <dig>  copies of tdcrt <dig> . if tdcrt <dig> distribution were indeed random, we would expect that the distribution of clones lacking tdcrt <dig>  would approximate normality. the mean number of clones expected to lack a tdcrt1-containing element and the theoretical standard deviation  can be estimated using theorem  <dig> of holst  <cit> . specifically,

 mean=ne-npkÂ ;Â sd=n2npk <dig>  

where n is the number of nuclear dna-containing clones on the macroarray , n is the expected number of clones showing tdcrt <dig> hybridization , and pk is the probability of any copy of the element "falling" within a clone . insertion of the preceding values into the equations produced a mean of  <dig>  clones per macroarray with a standard deviation of  <dig>  however, we determined that  <dig>  of the  <dig>  clones on the macroarray did not exhibit tdcrt <dig> hybridization. consequently, the observed number of clones lacking tdcrt <dig> hybridization is  <dig> times  the expected standard deviation for a normal distribution, strongly supporting the premise that the distribution of tdcrt <dig> is not random.

of note, nine overgos representing common ty1-copia-like or ty3-gypsy-like repeats from loblolly pine were hybridized to bald cypress macroarrays. none of the loblolly pine repeat-based overgos hybridized to the taxodium filters .

discussion
the genome of bald cypress, a cupressaceae conifer, is three times the size of the human genome but only half the size of the genomes of most pinaceae conifers  <cit> . bald cypress appears to be a diploid like its pinaceae cousins and, since evidence suggests that conifers do not likely require or utilize more genes than other seed plants  <cit> , a natural hypothesis is that the bald cypress genome contains lots of repetitive, non-coding dna. our cot analysis supports this general tenet as the repetitive fraction of the bald cypress genome is substantial . however, the hr and mr components of bald cypress have relatively low mean repetition frequencies . the idea that bald cypress repeats tend to be found in low copy numbers is supported by analysis of the hr sequences with the de novo repeat detection functions of the sequence read classification pipeline   <cit> . srcp analysis reveals that only  <dig> % of  <dig> bald cypress hr reads showed enough sequence identity with each other to be grouped by the srcp into the "probable repeats" category. in comparison, srcp evaluation of random sanger sequence reads from sorghum bicolor , a plant with a genome one-thirteenth the size of bald cypress  <cit> , resulted in categorization of 27% of sorghum reads as "probable repeats" despite the fact that the sorghum sequences were not specifically enriched for repeats  <cit> .

why the taxodium genome has so much low-copy repetitive dna is unknown. a reasonable guess is that the majority of mobile element amplification events in bald cypress occurred tens to hundreds of millions of years ago, and since then element proliferation/activity has been severely restricted. if mobile element amplification was suppressed long ago, the copies of each repetitive element would presumably begin to diverge until they were eventually no longer readily recognizable as being derived from the same source. indeed, the limited studies of mobile elements in conifers do indicate that there is considerable sequence divergence among members of retroelement families  <cit> ; moreover, much of the dna within sequenced regions of conifer genomes lacks features characteristic of known mobile elements, low-complexity repeats, or genes  <cit> . since all conifers possess enormous genomes, it is possible that some of the mobile element amplification events that underlie the behemoth c-values of conifers occurred prior to the divergence of the major conifer families; this idea should be much easier to test once genome sequences become available for conifers.

only  <dig> % of reads  showed reasonable homology  to previously annotated transposons; top hits were to copia-like retroelements from ginkgo biloba , sequoiadendron giganteum , and picea glauca , and a gypsy-like element from abies veitchii . the hr read with the highest level of similarity to a previously characterized retroelement  was used to design an overgo probe  that was hybridized to bald cypress macroarrays. the element represented by the overgo, i.e., tdcrt <dig>  was estimated to be present in approximately  <dig>  copies per 1c genome. as described above, 80% of hr sequences are present in copy numbers between  <dig>  and  <dig> . if half the remaining 20% of sequences in the hr component reassociate after 10Â·cot1/ <dig>  then we would predict that the remaining half  would reassociate prior to  <dig> Â·cot1/ <dig>  in other words, we would expect less than 10% of hr sequences to have an iteration frequency greater than  <dig> . since tdcrt <dig> has a frequency of  <dig>  copies per genome, it seems reasonable to assume that few, if any, genome sequences are more redundant than tdcrt <dig>  statistical evaluation of the distribution of tdcrt <dig> among clones on a macroarray suggests that it is found in a decidedly non-random distribution throughout the bald cypress genome. that one of the most redundant sequences in the  <dig>  gb taxodium genome is found in only  <dig>  copies and is distributed in a decidedly non-random fashion initially struck us as a bit surprising. however, as baucom et al.  <cit>  note, "two of the many misconceptions about te  properties in higher eukaryotes are that they are highly repetitive and are randomly scattered about the genome."

our previous studies on the loblolly pine genome suggest that, as in bald cypress, the majority of pine repetitive dna sequences are highly diverged and ostensibly ancient. however, in contrast to bald cypress, there appear to be at least a few retroelement families in loblolly pine of more pronounced conservation . for example, the retroelement ifg <dig>  <cit>  is found in  <dig>  copies and accounts for about  <dig> % of the pine genome  <cit>  while the athila-like retroelement gymny is found in approximately  <dig>  copies and accounts for  <dig> % of the loblolly pine genome  <cit> . together, ifg <dig> and gymny make up  <dig>  gb of the loblolly pine genome, a value  <dig>  times that of the arabidopsis thaliana genome  <cit> . as the pine genome is roughly twice the size of that of bald cypress, it is possible that the activity of ifg- <dig>  gymny, and other mobile element families are, in part, responsible for the larger genome of loblolly pine  compared to bald cypress.

the sl component of bald cypress accounts for  <dig> % of its genome. this is an amount  <dig>  times the size of the arabidopsis genome. because conifers appear to have functional gene numbers similar to those of diploid angiosperms  <cit> , it is possible that much of the sl dna of taxodium is composed of repetitive elements that have diverged to the point that they are now "single-copy" in nature, and indeed, studies on other conifers have suggested that the high sequence complexity of their low-copy dna is likely due, in part, to repeat divergence  <cit> . duplication of genes and/or pseudogene production may also contribute to the size of the sl component. it is interesting to note that the macroarray hybridization results using probes for taxodium "single-copy" genes  indicate that there are  <dig> - <dig>  positive clone hits per probe per estimated 1c genome equivalent. this result could indicate that bac library coverage is actually greater than what we calculated based on insert size and clone number or that the genome size of bald cypress is actually smaller than previously reported. alternatively, some of our probes may be hybridizing to multiple loci. because our analysis was based upon macroarray hybridization and not pcr, it is also possible that some of the amplicon and/or overgo probes we developed contain regions with significant sequence identity to loci not amplified using the primers from the previous phylogenetic studies. such loci could be paralogous genes or pseudogenes. of note, pseudogenes have been described in a number of pinaceae conifers including pines  <cit> , larches  <cit> , and spruces  <cit> . in a recent examination of ten bac sequences from loblolly pine, kovach et al.  <cit>  found that pseudogenes were five times more common than genes with potential protein coding functions - whether such a high pseudogene level holds for the genome as a whole is unknown. to our knowledge, pseudogenes have not been reported in cupressaceae conifers, although the amount of sequence information for cupressaceae is minute compared to that for pinaceae. as a means of exploring whether pseudogenes are common in bald cypress, we plan to sequence taxodium bac clones including those recognized by the probes listed in table  <dig> 

hybridization of loblolly pine retroelement sequence probes to macroarrays of taxodium produced no positive signals. this is not particularly surprising as fossil evidence indicates that the pinaceae and the cupressaceae have been separate lineages for roughly  <dig> million years  <cit> .

analysis of the bald cypress hr sequence with must  <cit>  resulted in detection of  <dig> potential mites . none of the mites shared terminal-inverted repeats, and hence each potential mite was considered a member of its own mite family. further analysis of the potential mites will be facilitated by sequencing of bald cypress bacs and random genomic dna.

CONCLUSIONS
we have explored the genome of bald cypress using several molecular techniques. of particular note, we have generated a bac library for bald cypress. this is the first large-insert library for a member of the cupressaceae and a logical tool in eventual sequencing and assembly of the bald cypress genome. with regard to genome biology, the nuclear dna of bald cypress appears to be largely composed of relatively low-copy repeats. these low-copy sequences may have arisen from ancient mobile element amplification events followed by millions of years of mobile element quiescence. sequencing of bacs should provide key information on gene structure while helping to define the roles that gene duplication, pseudogenes, and repeat sequence divergence have played in shaping the taxodium genome.
