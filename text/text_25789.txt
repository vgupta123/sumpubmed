BACKGROUND
bacillus cereus is an important gram-positive, spore-forming food-borne pathogen. many strains cause either an emetic or a diarrhoeal type of disease. the production of emetic toxin in foods, also referred to as cereulide, may cause nausea and vomiting. the diarrhoeal type of disease is associated with the production of enterotoxins in the intestines and may involve nhe, hbl and cytk  <cit> . food-borne disease caused by b. cereus is generally characterized by mild symptoms. however, recently more severe cases with a lethal outcome have been described  <cit> . b. cereus can also be the causative agent of other diseases, such as periodontitis, fulminant endophthalmitis, and meningitis in immuno-compromised patients  <cit> . b. cereus is ubiquitously found in the environment, including in soil. therefore, the transfer to food is not surprising and causes many problems  <cit> . in nutrient-rich environments, such as food, b. cereus shows low generation times putatively gaining advantage from its capacity to use various carbohydrates and proteinaceous substrates  <cit> . the regulation of gene expression plays an important role in the efficient selection of the preferred carbon and energy source for growth. annotation of the genome of b. cereus atcc  <dig> predicted the regulation of gene expression to be highly complex involving over two hundred transcriptional regulators managing its  <dig> open reading frames   <cit> . one of these putative regulators is the catabolite control protein ccpa, which is a member of the laci-family of transcriptional regulators. ccpa and the regulatory mechanism of the catabolite repression are highly conserved in low-gc gram-positives  <cit> . b. cereus atcc  <dig> ccpa shows 77% identity with b. subtilis ccpa. furthermore, ccpa in b. subtilis has been shown to have a role in optimizing glucose metabolism and the underlying regulatory mechanisms have recently been reviewed  <cit> . regulation of gene expression by ccpa is mediated by its binding to dna at a specific cis-binding sequence, the catabolite responsive element   <cit> .

in recent years the regulon of b. subtilis ccpa has been studied extensively by transcriptome analyses, revealing genes and operons under direct and indirect control of ccpa  <cit> . furthermore, moreno et al.  <cit>  showed a clear correlation between the glucose-repressed genes and the presence of predicted cre-sites. moreover, they showed ccpa-mediated glucose-independent regulation of expression  <cit> . other organisms for which the role of ccpa in carbon metabolism was established are lactobacillus acidophilus  <cit>  and lactococcus lactis  <cit> . recently, a role for ccpa in the control of virulence of staphylococcus aureus  <cit> , streptococcus pneumoniae  <cit> , and clostridium perfringens was reported  <cit>  and reviewed  <cit> .

notably, comparative genomics of the different species of the b. cereus group revealed reduced capacity to metabolize carbohydrates and increased potential for protein metabolism as compared to b. subtilis  <cit> . here we report on the role of ccpa in regulation of metabolism and virulence in b. cereus atcc  <dig> 

RESULTS
growth and glucose utilization of the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type
growth of the wild-type and the ccpa deletion strain was assessed under aerobic conditions in bhi containing  <dig> g/l d-glucose, and revealed specific growth rates  of  <dig>  and  <dig>  , respectively . statistical analysis showed the growth rates of the wild-type and deletion strain to be significantly different. assessment of glucose concentrations at different time points during growth revealed a reduction in the glucose consumption rate for the ccpa deletion strain compared to that of the wild-type . the glucose concentration at early-exponential growth for both the wild-type and the ccpa deletion strain was around  <dig>  g/l, and glucose was still available in the mid-exponential growth phase. notably, glucose was depleted in the wild-type culture upon entry into the transition phase, whereas glucose depletion in the ccpa deletion strain culture was only observed in the stationary phase of growth.

overview of the transcriptome data
analyses of the transcriptome data of the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type in samples taken at the four time points indicated in figure  <dig>  showed expression of a large number of orfs to be affected upon ccpa deletion. remarkably, the number of genes differentially expressed increased from  <dig> at early exponential phase to over  <dig> genes in the stationary phase . the large differences in gene expression in transition and stationary phase cells of the ccpa deletion strain compared to that of the wild-type are conceivably affected by the respective presence and absence of glucose. furthermore, these differences may point to the initiation of secondary effects of the ccpa deletion in these growth phases on gene expression and consequently cellular performance. therefore, transcriptome analysis was focused on the early- and mid-exponential phase samples where glucose is still present at high levels in the cultures of both the ccpa deletion strain and the wild-type. in early-exponential phase,  <dig> genes showed higher expression and  <dig> genes showed a lower expression in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type. for mid-exponential phase cells these numbers were  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively. when corrected for overlap between regulated genes in the early- and mid-exponential phase, a total of  <dig> genes expression in the exponential phase was shown to be higher in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type and for  <dig> genes expression in the ccpa deletion strain was observed to be lower than in the wild-type . consequently, genes that show a higher expression in the ccpa deletion strain are possibly repressed by ccpa, whereas genes that show a lower expression in the ccpa deletion strain may be activated by ccpa in the wild-type. the number of genes putatively regulated are similar to those described for ccpa-regulated genes in b. subtilis  <cit> .

expression ratios of six randomly chosen genes with significantly altered expression in the ccpa deletion strain  were quantified using qpcr. expression ratios obtained by microarray analysis were compared to ratios obtained by qpcr. the tested genes showed the same trend in expression, with differential expression only slightly more pronounced in qpcr experiments, a feature observed before in such comparisons  <cit> . this indicates the microarray platform to be suited for gene expression analysis .

identification of the b. cereus cre-site consensus and in silico analysis
direct regulation exerted by ccpa is indicated by the presence of a cre-site. by a series of subsequent alignments searches, the b. cereus atcc  <dig> consensus cre-site was identified and visualized in figure  <dig> . this showed the consensus sequence to consist of only 16-bp for b. cereus atcc  <dig>  wwgwaarcgwwwwcaw, whereas an 18-bp consensus sequence was reported for b. subtilis, wwtgnaarcgnwwwcaww,  <cit> . nevertheless, a high similarity between these consensus sequences exists. the b. cereus atcc  <dig> genome was scanned with the obtained cre-site consensus , identifying the putative cre-sites . a number of  <dig> putative cre-sites were identified for  <dig> out of  <dig> genes that show a higher expression in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type in exponential phase cells, and these  <dig> genes are part of  <dig> putative operons  <cit> . furthermore,  <dig> putative cre-sites were identified in the promoter region of  <dig> out of  <dig> genes with a lower expression in the ccpa deletion strain  in exponential phase cells, these  <dig> genes are part of  <dig> putative operons  <cit> . these results are in agreement with the general observation that activation by ccpa occurs less frequently than repression by ccpa  <cit> . for b. subtilis not all identified putative cre-sites could be shown to be functional  <cit>  and the predicted cre-sites in b. cereus should therefore be regarded putative.

analysis of genes differentially expressed in the ccpa deletion strain
the cog annotation reveals that the differentially expressed genes are mainly involved in metabolic processes , including glycolytic and gluconeogenic genes and genes encoding the citric acid cycle . for approximately  <dig> differentially expressed genes a homologous gene was identified to be ccpa regulated in b. subtilis  <cit> . of these genes a total number of  <dig> genes were annotated to have a function in the glucose metabolism . genes that were first identified in this study to be putatively regulated by ccpa with an apparent and interesting function are discussed below.

‡ in this column it is indicated whether a putative cre-site was identified for the gene. numbers indicate the number of putative cre-sites identified, a + indicates that a gene is in the same operon as a gene for which a putative cre-site was identified, and a - indicates no putative cre-site could be identified.

one of the glycolytic genes found to be expressed lower in the ccpa deletion strain was yfmt. this gene encodes a non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase , for which  <dig> putative cre-sites could be identified. we propose to rename yfmt as gapn, since this gene shows similarity with gapn of the other members of the b. cereus group, and with gapn of b. halodurans, streptococci and clostridia  <cit> . notably, the gene is lacking in b. subtilis  <cit> . next to the non-phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, two phosphorylating glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases encoding genes  are present on the b. cereus atcc  <dig> genome. the function of gapn in microbial metabolism is yet unclear. recently, asanuma and hino  showed a role for ccpa in expression control of gapn in streptococcus bovis and proposed that nadph is provided by gapn activity for nadph-dependent biosynthetic reactions, thereby maintaining an optimal redox balance at the same time. however, in hyperthermophilic archaea gapn has been shown to play a role in accelerating glycolysis as it can produce 3-phospho-d-glycerate from d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate in a one-step reaction, instead of two steps <cit> . as a putative drawback, atp is not produced in this one-step reaction. the exact role of gapn in b. cereus metabolism remains to be elucidated.

the gluconeogenic genes expressed higher in the ccpa deletion strain included ywji and gapb. the ywji gene is part of the putative mura2-ywji operon and is annotated as a fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase. the ywji gene of b. subtilis, that shows similarity to ywji of b. cereus, is annotated to be a fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase, as a member of the glpx-family. the other annotated fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatase gene for b. subtilis, fbp, which is no member of the glpx-family, is not regulated by ccpa and deletion of this gene seems to have no effect on gluconeogenesis  <cit> . a corresponding fbp homologue appears to be absent in b. cereus. however, on the b. cereus genome two members of the glpx-family of fructose- <dig> -bisphosphatases are present, of which ywji expression was found to be affected by ccpa deletion, accordingly a putative cre-site was identified in the promoter region of its operon. the gapb gene encodes a nad-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. three putative cre-sites were identified for gapb in b. cereus . in contrast, no cre-sites were identified for gapb in b. subtilis, and its expression was shown to be only indirectly affected by ccpa deletion  <cit> . furthermore, gluconeogenesis in b. subtilis was shown to be regulated by the transcriptional regulator ccpn  <cit> . ccpn is also present on the genome of b. cereus atcc  <dig> and putative ccpn binding sites can be found in front of the gluconeogenic genes encoding gapb and pcka  <cit> . combined with our results this would point to dual control of the expression of gluconeogenic genes in b. cereus by ccpn and ccpa.

the expression of genes with functions in routing metabolism towards the citric acid cycle appeared to be higher in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type and included ~ <dig> genes involved in amino acid catabolism. this included the bkd-operon  that is common among the bacilli, and that is involved in the catabolism of valine and leucine  <cit> . one putative cre-site in front of the bkd-operon and two within the operon were identified in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  notably, ccpa was previously shown to play no role in the regulation of expression of this operon in b. subtilis  <cit> . in contrast, the ilv-leu-operon of b. subtilis coding for biosynthesis of branched chain amino acids has been shown to be activated by ccpa  <cit> , whereas no involvement of ccpa was found in regulation of expression of this operon in b. cereus under the conditions tested. the fact that no regulation of the ilv-leu-operon was observed, although its expression on the microarray was apparent , could be due to a complex regulation of this operon under the tested circumstances involving cody and tnra  <cit> . expression of several genes encoding enzymes involved in catabolism of nucleosides was higher in the b. cereus ccpa deletion strain, this included the putative yuf-operon  encoding nucleoside transport under the apparent control of the transcriptional regulator encoded by the also higher expressed ymfc , for both the regulator and the yuf-operon putative cre-sites could be identified . interestingly, expression of two putative operons with an apparent function in catabolism was higher in the ccpa deletion strain, and possible functions were assessed using in silico analysis. the first operon , which is not present in b. subtilis, consists of three genes and based on phylogenetic studies of the protein sequences it is suggested to annotate the genes as an l-fuculose phosphate aldolase  <cit>  , an l-fucose and/or arabinose isomerase  and an l-fuculose phosphate aldolase . this suggest a function for this operon in the catabolism of fucose and/or arabinose. consequently, names and functions that we suggest are fcli for the l-fucose isomerase , fclk for the l-fuculokinase  and fcla for the l-fuculose phosphate aldolase  . a putative cre-site could be identified in front of this operon. the second operon consists of three genes and in silico analysis of this operon  suggested the transporter protein  to function as a proton/sodium-aspartate symporter  <cit> , as an alternative to gltt. subsequently, aspartate can be converted into ammonia and fumarate by the aspartate ammonia lyase , after which fumarate can be metabolized to malate by one of the two fumarate hydratases encoded on the genome of b. cereus. the gene bc <dig> encodes a malic enzyme, mals, which is responsible for converting malate into pyruvate. this suggests that the operon encodes enzymes involved in the catabolism of aspartate to pyruvate. this operon is unique for the species of the b. cereus group, as the genes are not found as an operon in genomes of other bacteria. a putative cre-site was identified for the first gene of the operon . the two-component system  next to this operon shows high similarity with the two-component system glnk-glnl of b. subtilis, which is involved in glutamine utilization  <cit> . whether bc1742-bc <dig> functions as a two-component system, involved in aspartate sensing and triggering expression of enzymes involved in its metabolism, remains to be elucidated.

glutamate is a product of protein and amino acid catabolism and acts as link between nitrogen and carbon metabolism, mediated by glutamate synthase and glutamate dehydrogenase, as described for b. subtilis  <cit> . the b. subtilis genome contains a glutamate synthase  and two glutamate dehydrogenases  of which the gudb dehydrogenase appears to be inactive  <cit> . glutamate biosynthesis in b. subtilis has recently been shown to be tightly regulated by interaction of rocg and gltc  <cit> , but these genes are not encoded on the b. cereus genome. the microbial glutamate synthases generally belong to the nadph-glts family of glutamate synthases and are encoded by two genes  <cit> . in the glutamate synthase reaction l-glutamate is produced from l-glutamine and 2-oxoglutarate, with the latter compound derived from the citric acid cycle  <cit> . the gltab operon of b. subtilis is suggested to be regulated by ccpa  <cit> . on the genome of b. cereus atcc  <dig> only one glutamate synthase gene  is present and its expression at various phases of growth is similar in the wild-type and its ccpa deletion strain, indicating that its expression is not regulated by ccpa. moreover, it is unclear to which family of glutamate synthases glta of b. cereus belongs. interestingly, gudb was the only gene present on the genome of b. cereus encoding a glutamate dehydrogenase, and its expression was observed to be clearly higher in the ccpa deletion strain . glutamate dehydrogenase is responsible for the reaction from l-glutamate to 2-oxoglutarate linking l-glutamate to the citric acid cycle  <cit> . higher expression of gudb in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type, together with the fact that it is the only glutamate dehydrogenase annotated on the genome of b. cereus suggests that gudb is the active glutamate dehydrogenase for b. cereus. this is supported by the fact that the 9-bp sequence, encoding the  <dig> amino acids causing the inactivity of gudb in b. subtilis  <cit> , are absent in the gudb sequence of b. cereus atcc  <dig>  two putative cre-sites in front of and one within gudb were identified pointing to ccpa-controlled expression in b. cereus.

b. subtilis contains a large number of carbohydrate catabolic pathways  <cit> , whereas the number of these pathways is limited in b. cereus. the observed deficiency of the b. subtilis ccpa deletion strain in growth with ammonium as the sole nitrogen-source, has been attributed to the regulation of the gltab genes by ccpa  <cit>  and the read-through transcription of the rocg gene  <cit> . the lack of regulation of glta in b. cereus by ccpa, together with a similarity to the b. subtilis glta of only 46%, offers an explanation for the observation that the ccpa deletion strain of b. cereus is able to grow with ammonium as the sole nitrogen source , conceivably with gudb as the active glutamate dehydrogenase.

the role of ccpa in optimisation of glucose metabolism is apparent, since glycolytic enzymes were expressed lower and expression of genes encoding citric acid cycle enzymes was shown to be higher in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type. up-regulation in the ccpa deletion strain was found for ~ <dig> genes encoding enzymes involved in protein, peptide and amino acid metabolism . this is seemingly in contrast with the proposed preferred use of proteinaceous substrates for growth of b. cereus, a hypothesis put forward by ivanova et al.  <cit> . this hypothesis was supported by the annotation of a large number of genes encoding proteolytic enzymes, a multiplicity of peptide and amino acid transporters, and a large variety of amino acid degradation pathways. however, under the conditions tested glucose is used as the carbon and energy source  and genes encoding enzymes involved in protein, peptide and amino acid catabolism appear to be subject to catabolite repression, indicating that under the conditions tested, glycolysis rather than protein catabolism is the preferred energy generation route of b. cereus atcc  <dig> 

ccpa-mediated catabolite control of enterotoxin gene expression in b. cereus
in early- and mid-exponential phase cells the expression of the nhe-operon , coding for the non-hemolytic toxin nhe  <cit> , was shown to be higher in the ccpa deletion strain compared to the wild-type. this higher expression was even more apparent in the stationary phase where an almost 20-fold stimulation was observed . furthermore, a putative cre-site was identified for this operon. for the hbl-operon , coding for the hbl enterotoxin  <cit> , an 8-fold increase in the ccpa deletion strain was seen in the stationary phase and a putative cre-site could be identified . differential expression of cytk, encoding the enterotoxin cytotoxin k  <cit> , was not observed under the conditions tested, and no putative cre-site could be identified. these results indicate involvement of ccpa in the catabolite control of the expression of at least two major enterotoxins in b. cereus atcc  <dig>  many bacteria use glucose as their preferred carbon and energy source as it can be obtained from plant-derived polysaccharides, which can be found in many environments including foods. we hypothesize that glucose can function as a signalling molecule enabling cre site-mediated, ccpa-dependent repression of gene expression for microorganisms such as lactobacillus plantarum  <cit>  and b. cereus that occur in several environments, including soil, plant and the human gastro intestinal  tract. in the gi tract, in the absence of glucose, ccpa-dependent repression is thus lifted, and this allows for induction of pathways involved in catabolism of other substrates present in the gi tract such as fucose, a major degradation product of mucus related fucosylated glycans  <cit> . notably, results of this study suggest the putative fucose utilisation operon of b. cereus to be repressed by ccpa in the presence of glucose, and this pathway may thus be activated in the gi-tract under glucose limiting conditions. a similar mode of regulation seems applicable for the nhe and hbl enterotoxin operons, for which the combination of transcriptome data and the identification of putative cre-sites, suggest these to be ccpa controlled as well. our results offer an explanation for the observations recently made by ouhib et al.  <cit> , who showed that final enterotoxin levels reached, depended on the carbon and energy sources used for growth, with the lowest levels reached with cells grown on glucose. the anaerobic growth transcriptional regulators fnr and resd have recently been found to play a role in enterotoxin production also, next to plcr  <cit> , and combined with our data, this points to an elaborate control of enterotoxin production in b. cereus at the transcriptional level based on a variety of input signals mediated by a range of transcriptional regulators. notably, ccpa has been reported also to play a role in toxin formation in c. perfringens  <cit> , and in s. aureus deletion of ccpa was shown to affect the expression of the virulence gene hla, encoding α-hemolysin  <cit> .

CONCLUSIONS
b. cereus atcc  <dig> catabolite control protein ccpa is involved in optimizing the catabolism of glucose with concomitant repression of a range of metabolic pathways. furthermore, ccpa-mediated glucose sensing is shown to provide an additional mode of control in moderating the expression of the nhe- and hbl-operon in this human pathogen.
