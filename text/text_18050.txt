BACKGROUND
biliverdin is a linear tetrapyrrole produced by ring cleavage of heme catalyzed by the enzyme heme oxygenase  
 <cit> . in animals, heme cleavage by ho occurs selectively at the α−methene bridge to generate the most physiologically relevant biliverdin ixα isomer. hence, the term “biliverdin” typically refers specifically to biliverdin ixα, and this usage is applied throughout in this paper. biliverdin is best known as a degradative intermediate associated with erythrocyte and hemoglobin turnover. it is subsequently reduced via nadph biliverdin reductase  to bilirubin ixα that in turn is consecutively bound to serum albumin and glucuronic acid for excretion in bile. the overall process serves to eliminate heme - which is toxic when accumulated.

bilirubin ixα is also known to associate with cell membranes where it quenches the propagation of reactive oxygen species 
 <cit>  conferring protection to membrane lipids and proteins against oxidative damage. thus, an additional function of biliverdin is to serve as the immediate source of bilirubin ixα that in turn acts as a cytoprotective antioxidant. it is not clear if biliverdin is oxidatively regenerated after bilirubin ixα reacts with ros
 <cit> . though bilirubin ixα is an effective ros quencher, biliverdin administered at tissue injury/inflammatory sites appears as effective a cytoprotectant as bilirubin ixα
 <cit> . biliverdin‘s effectiveness has been attributed to its hydrophilicity and efficient conversion to bilirubin ixα
 <cit> . in addition, biliverdin interaction with biliverdin reductase signals the downstream production of anti-inflammatory cytokine interferon-10
 <cit>  and the nitrosylation-dependent inhibition of pro-inflammatory tlr <dig> expression
 <cit> . thus, biliverdin, acting together with biliverdin reductase, is increasingly recognized as a potential anti-inflammatory therapeutic agent
 <cit> . examples of its cytoprotective effects in animal models include those for ischemia/reperfusion following liver
 <cit>  and small bowel
 <cit>  transplants, vascular injury
 <cit> , endotoxic shock
 <cit> , vascular intimal hyperplasia
 <cit> , and nephropathy
 <cit> . in addition, biliverdin has been reported to inhibit in vitro replication of hepatitis c
 <cit>  and other viruses
 <cit>  and to reverse parameters of type  <dig> diabetes in mice
 <cit> . the growing list of potential clinical applications for biliverdin suggests a future need for high-quality preparations in ample quantity.

biliverdin is also produced by microbes and plants
 <cit> . in cyanobacteria, red algae, and plants, it serves primarily  as precursor to photosensitive linear tetrapyrroles such as phycocyanobilin and phycoerythrobilin
 <cit> . these in turn serve as chromophores for cyanobacterial and red algal light-harvesting phycobiliprotein complexes and the light-sensing receptor phytochrome
 <cit> . in these organisms, biliverdin ixα is the predominant isomer produced via ho enzymes with sequence homologies to mammalian ho1
 <cit> .

to meet the projected pharmaceutical demand for biliverdin, high yield and low cost methods that provide the ixα isomer in high purity and preferably from non-mammalian sources are needed. currently, commercial biliverdin is predominantly derived by chemical oxidation of bilirubin
 <cit> . the source bilirubin  is extracted from mammalian bile under acidic conditions that generate isomers  and consequently lead to biliverdin preparations of unsuitable purity . reported non-mammalian synthesis of biliverdin include escherichia coli cultures expressing ho <dig> from rat
 <cit>  and cyanobacteria
 <cit>  and yeast cultures supplemented with hemoglobin
 <cit> . in these reports, the amounts of biliverdin produced are not documented or appear low. biliverdin extracted from salmon bile is reported
 <cit> , but the potential for scalable production is not discussed.

here, we report the use of e. coli to synthesize biliverdin and describe procedures for the scalable production of the ixα isomer. this was achieved by sequence optimization of the cyanobacterial ho <dig> gene for enhanced expression in e. coli and development of growth culture parameters that promote biliverdin production.

the ho <dig> gene sequence was codon optimized for expression in e. coli using dna <dig>  algorithms  . the coding sequence for hexahistidine was incorporated at the 5’ end to provide a 6x his tag at the n-terminus of the synthesized protein. the e.coli codon optimized gene  was synthesized and inserted into plasmid vector pjexpress <dig> by dna <dig>  inc. . the resulting vector, pjexpress401-mho <dig> , was transformed into bl <dig> star™  chemically competent e. coli to give e. coli strain bl <dig> 

testing carbon sources for biliverdin production
several carbon sources at different concentrations and in combination were examined for capabilities to support growth and biliverdin synthesis by e. coli strains bl <dig> and bl <dig>  cultures were grown in 125ml capacity erlenmeyer flasks on a new brunswick g <dig> rotary incubator shaker  in 50ml luria-bertani  medium
 <cit>  with various single carbon sources that included sucrose , mannitol , sorbitol , lactose , succinate , malate  or combinations of carbon sources that included mannitol  + glucose , sucrose  + glucose , mannitol  + sorbitol , or mannitol  + sorbitol . ampicillin or kanamycin  was used for selection, and isopropyl-β−thiogalactopyranoside   was added   of ~ <dig> ) as inducer except when lactose was the carbon source. growth was monitored at a <dig> and the culture color was recorded when stationary phase growth was achieved . biliverdin levels were estimated by absorbance spectroscopy using a mm extinction coefficient of  <dig> at 650nm  using a spectramax plus <dig> absorbance microplate reader .

RESULTS
effect of carbon source on biliverdin production
several potential carbon sources, alone and in combination, were examined for their abilities to support biliverdin production by e. coli strains bl <dig> and bl <dig> growing in lb medium . lactose at  <dig> and  <dig> %  alone or in combination with d-glucose yielded green cultures containing  <dig> to 4mg l- <dig> biliverdin without iptg addition. e. coli strain bl <dig> cultures grown with d-mannitol  also yielded green cultures whereas other carbon compounds and combinations  yielded brown or yellow-green and pale green cultures containing < <dig>  and <2mg l- <dig> biliverdin, respectively. similarly, e. coli strain bl <dig> produced enhanced amounts of biliverdin with lactose alone or in combination with d-glucose. these results show that certain carbohydrates and particularly lactose , alone or in combination with d-glucose, and d-mannitol  support higher levels of biliverdin production by e. coli strains bl <dig> and bl <dig> growing in lb medium as compared to other carbon sources. with lactose, the addition of iptg was not required for enhanced biliverdin production offering a practical and economic advantage for large-scale, commercial production of biliverdin.

b biliverdin concentrations were  <dig> to 4mg l- <dig> , < <dig> to > <dig>  mg l- <dig>  and < <dig> mg l- <dig> .

bioreactor batch culture production of biliverdin
based on observations that lactose enhanced biliverdin production, modified zy medium containing 2% wt vol- <dig> lactose was used to grow e. coli strains bl <dig> and bl <dig> in  <dig> l volumes in a new brunswick scientific bioflo  <dig> controller bioreactor. consistent biliverdin production was achieved with 40% dissolved o <dig>  agitation between  <dig> and  <dig> rpm, and continuous feeding of lactose  and glycerol  in fed-batch mode initiated 4h after culture inoculation . biliverdin was visible as and collected in green material that accumulated in the foam above the culture liquid surface . biliverdin was identified and quantitated by hplc analyses of the collected material. e. coli strains bl <dig> and e. coli bl <dig> produced between  <dig>  and 5mg  and between  <dig>  to  <dig> mg  of biliverdin, respectively, per l of culture. therefore, e. coli strain bl <dig> produced nearly twice the amount of biliverdin than e.coli strain bl <dig> in the bioreactor cultures growing in modified zy medium in fed-batch mode with lactose and glycerol. in contrast, the two strains produced approximately the same amounts of biliverdin when grown in lb medium with lactose  in small shaker flasks . when peptone was included in the fed-batch medium , e. coli strain bl <dig> bioreactor cultures produced between <dig>  to  <dig> mg l- <dig>  of biliverdin. e.coli strain bl <dig> produced between  <dig> and  <dig> mg l- <dig>  in modified nbs medium in batch mode.

biliverdin production was also achieved in a 100l bioreactor  batch mode cultures of e. coli strain bl <dig> grown in nbs medium containing 2%  lactose. biliverdin yields ranging between  <dig> to 311mg  were achieved. this rate of production was similar to that achieved by e. coli strain bl <dig> in the 2l bioreactor  batch mode cultures  indicating that biliverdin production by e. coli strain bl <dig> is scalable to larger volumes and quantities.

ho expression and activity
when grown in 2l bioreactor cultures, e. coli strain bl <dig> cells contained ni-nta recoverable proteins with molecular size ~ <dig> kd and detectable initially between  <dig> to 5h after inoculation and then until growth was terminated  . the proteins were equivalent in size to ho <dig> of synechocystis pcc <dig> with a 6x-his tag  and the gel excised protein showed sequence similarity to the cyanobacterial ho <dig> . extracts of e. coli strain bl <dig> cells harvested at 25h of bioreactor growth had ho activities of  <dig> pmol hr- <dig> mg protein- <dig> whereas extracts from e. coli strain bl <dig> star™  cells showed no or barely detectable activities . these results confirmed that e. coli strain bl <dig> synthesized an ho enzyme when grown under conditions that allowed accumulation of green pigment determined to be biliverdin .

identification of biliverdin ixα
the identity of the biliverdin extracted from e. coli strain bl <dig> cultures as biliverdin ixα was indicated by comparisons to authentic biliverdin ixα using absorbance spectroscopy, hplc, proton nmr spectroscopy  and mass spectroscopy . the degree of purity was >98% based on hplc profiles .
 <cit> .

e. coli produced biliverdin as substrate for biliverdin reductase a
purified biliverdin produced by e. coli bl <dig> was reduced to bilirubin ixα by recombinant human biliverdin reductase a and nadph . since human biliverdin reductase a specifically uses biliverdin ixα as substrate
 <cit> , this result confirms the identity of the e. coli bl <dig> produced biliverdin as the ixα isomer. it also suggests that the produced biliverdin has therapeutic potential because of its substrate interaction with the human enzyme and its facile conversion to bilirubin ixα.

CONCLUSIONS
methods for the scalable production of biliverdin by e. coli cultures were developed. production is enhanced with the use of an altered version of a cyanobacterial ho <dig> gene that is sequence-optimized for e. coli expression. the produced biliverdin is solely the physiologically relevant ixα isomer and is easily obtained at a high degree of purity . its purity and ability to serve as substrate for human nadph biliverdin reductase a suggest its potential as a clinically useful therapeutic for inflammatory diseases and conditions. when commercially produced for therapeutic applications, the biliverdin ixα preparations will undoubtedly require screening for and elimination of endotoxin contaminants that are a consequence and limitation of industrial scale production by e. coli cultures.
