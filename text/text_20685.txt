BACKGROUND
auxin is a key signal in plant development that regulates organogenesis from embryogenesis onward. this major phytohormone achieves its morphogenetic activity notably by regulating the transcription of a large number of downstream genes. in arabidopsis thaliana, the control of gene expression in response to auxin involves a complex network of  <dig> transcriptional regulators, consisting of  <dig> auxin/indole-3-acetic acid , that do not bind dna, and  <dig> auxin response factor , which are true transcription factors .

the current molecular model of the auxin signalling pathway assumes the formation of hetero-dimers between arf and aux/iaa in absence of auxin . according to  <cit>  these transcriptional regulators interact through a c-terminal dimerisation domain , made of two conserved sub-sequences known as domain iii  and domain iv  . arf can bind dna through a dna binding domain  and act either as activators  or repressors  of auxin-responsive transcription  depending on the amino acid composition of the intermediate domain linking the dbd to domain iii/iv . it should be noted that aux/iaa do not have a dbd and therefore are unable to regulate alone the transcription of auxin-responsive genes. when auxin accumulates in cells as a result of polar auxin transport or changes in biosynthesis, its perception targets the aux/iaa to the proteasome  <cit> , leading to their subsequent degradation. this subsequently releases arf, allowing them to regulate downstream genes.

it is only recently that the topology of the aux/iaa - arf network was analysed extensively  <cit> . a yeast-2-hybrid   <cit>  high-throughput approach, has allowed to test for most possible interactions between aux/iaa and arf proteins . a binary network was built from these data and a model-based graph clustering method  <cit>  that groups proteins on the basis of their connectivity profile  was used to explore this network. three clusters of proteins, that closely matched biological groups   <cit>  were identified in this way, thus demonstrating the rather stereotypical interaction properties of arf+, arf- and aux/iaa . here, we extended this approach to analyse the influence of the diii/iv primary sequence dissimilarities on the likelihood of interaction between auxin transcriptional regulators. to this end, we used a recently proposed generalisation of the mixture models for random graphs that offers the possibility to deal with valued graphs and to include explanatory variables  <cit> . this integrative statistical model constitutes the core of our pipeline of methods for analysing the influence of sequence dissimilarities between dimerisation domains on protein-protein interactions.

RESULTS
a binary network is often easier to interpret than a valued one. however, in our case, it does not fully represent the “true” biochemical network as an interaction network depends on several properties, such as interaction strength, protein concentration, spatial expression and synthesis/degradation dynamics of the proteins. we will first briefly recall how the binary network was built and analysed in  <cit> . then we will compare this previous approach with the analysis of a valued network, built to minimize the loss of information, before investigating how dissimilarities between dimerisation domains can be incorporated in such a modelling framework.

available y2h experimental data and binary aux/iaa - arf network
we used in this work a previously available y2h dataset where aux/iaa and arf interactions have been tested in yeast both ways  <cit> . interactions were tested for each protein fused to the activation  or to the binding domain  of the gal <dig> yeast transcription factor, thus allowing to minimize false positives. in addition and to minimize false negatives, two reporter genes, his <dig> and x-gal, were used for testing the interaction. in this experiment the interaction capacities of  <dig> transcriptional regulators were tested , thus making a total of  <dig> interactions tested. we give in table  <dig> an example of the results. note that the y2h dataset was obtained using only diii/iv for arf, while full-length proteins were used for aux/iaa .


the y2h data were previously used to build a binary network  <cit> . this required choosing thresholds for both tests on the basis of their empirical distributions. the threshold was set between the successive marks ‘+?’ and ‘+’ for the x-gal test  and at  <dig>  for the his <dig> test  <cit> ; see an illustration of these thresholds in fig.  <dig>  decision rules were then used to combine the four test outputs .
fig.  <dig> three-component gaussian mixture model estimated on the basis of the optical density  ratio sample . od ratios are represented up to a limit of  <dig>  for readability reasons



we aimed at analysing binary and valued networks potentially influenced by dimerisation sequence dissimilarities. these networks should be built on the same transcriptional regulators. we therefore excluded arf <dig> since this arf showed no interactions in the previously published aux/iaa - arf binary network  <cit> . we also excluded arf <dig> and  <dig> since they do not possess diii/iv. we then built a new binary network using the same thresholds as in  <cit> . we also tested his <dig> thresholds at  <dig>  and  <dig> . applying these thresholds only slightly modify the binary network . the binary network built using the his <dig> threshold at  <dig>  will thus be used in the rest of this work.

building a valued network from y2h data
combining the x-gal and his <dig> test outputs in a single interaction distance requires a standardization procedure . the objective of standardization is to avoid dependency on the elementary distance type and scale. it is important to point out that, in our case, the valued network does not represent affinities between proteins, but rather the likelihoods of interaction between proteins. we tested several weightings of the outputs of the x-gal and his <dig> tests and in particular:
network a: wx-gal= <dig>  and whis3= <dig> ;

network b: wx-gal= <dig>  and whis3= <dig> ;

network c: wx-gal= <dig>  and whis3= <dig> .



to this end, we visualized the standardised distance distributions corresponding to “no interaction”  and “interaction”  according to the previously defined binary assignment . network c is characterized by standardised distances corresponding to “no interaction” spread over a wide range of values, thus leading to a rather large overlap with standardised distances corresponding to “interaction”. network a on the contrary concentrates standardised distances corresponding to “no interaction” over a small range of values, leading to a clear separation with standardised distances corresponding to “interaction”. finally, network b  presents a reasonable compromise between the dispersion of standardised distances corresponding to “no interaction” and “interaction” and their overlap. this comparison of the networks highlights the fact that the x-gal test seems more reliable than the his <dig> test in this dataset, probably because of the very long tail corresponding to higher interaction likelihoods for this test . in the following, we will thus present clustering results only for networks a and b.

network topology analysis using bernoulli and gaussian mixture models
to gain further insights into the binary and valued networks topology, we applied a model-based graph clustering methods in order to group the transcriptional regulators on the basis of their connectivity profiles. the key feature of mixture models for random graphs is to give a probabilistic summary of the connectivity structure by uncovering clusters of proteins that share similar connectivity profiles. the parameters of the model are the cluster weight distribution and the connectivity distributions for each pair of clusters.

in the case of a binary adjacency matrix z, connectivity distributions are bernoulli distributions parametrized by connectivity probabilities, that is the probability for proteins of two clusters to interact:
  zij|i∈cq,j∈cℓ∼ℬ. 

the interaction zij between vertices i and j knowing that i belongs to cluster q and j to cluster ℓ follows a bernoulli distribution of parameter πq,ℓ.

in the case of a weighted adjacency matrix x, the connectivity distributions are gaussian distributions:
  xij|i∈cq,j∈cℓ∼nμqℓ,σ <dig>  

it should be noted that parameter μqℓ of a gaussian mixture  model is the mean likelihood of interaction between proteins of two clusters. this is different from the bernoulli mixture  model where the parameter πqℓ is the probability for proteins of two clusters to interact. this makes the biological interpretation of gm model parameters less straightforward.

the inference of such models is not restricted to the estimation of the cluster weight and connectivity distributions but encompasses the inference of the number of clusters using a penalized likelihood criterion. the principle of penalized likelihood criteria such as the integrated completed likelihood  criterion consists in making a trade-off between an adequate fitting of the model to the data and a reasonable number of parameters to be estimated. the icl criterion is specifically tailored to the clustering objective and is expected to favour models such that the uncertainty of protein assignment to clusters is low. jeffreys’ rules of thumb  <cit>  suggest that a difference of icl of at least log= <dig>  is needed to deem the model with the higher icl substantially better. since the icl criterion is only asymptotically valid , the number of clusters given by this criterion should be considered as indicative. we thus chose to systematically investigate potential interesting clusterings combining icl values, prior biological knowledge and within- and between-cluster distances for assessing the homogeneities and separabilities of clusters. one key output for the validation of a model-based clustering method is the posterior distributions of protein assignment to clusters. for each protein, this posterior distribution was degenerate  whatever the model used, which eased the interpretation of the clustering outputs.

building a bernoulli mixture model
note that the clustering results reported here using bm models slightly differ from those presented in  <cit>  since we only used  <dig> proteins .

when estimating bm models on the basis of the  <dig> protein binary network, the icl criterion favours first the 6-cluster bm model and next the 4-cluster bm model . however, the icl difference  between the 4- and the 6-cluster bm models was not significant according to jeffreys’ rules of thumb.


for the 4-cluster bm model , we found three clusters corresponding to biologically meaningful groups and an “outlier” cluster. the three clusters c1bmarf+, c2bmarf- and c3bmiaa show a specific enrichment in respectively arf+, arf- and aux/iaa. the fourth cluster c4bmoutlier can be categorized as “outlier” since it groups one arf- with six aux/iaa in addition of being poorly defined as detailed below. a connectivity graph representing the interaction probability between clusters is given in fig.  <dig> 
fig.  <dig> connectivity graph and associated probabilities for the 4-cluster bm model. the connectivity matrix describes the topology of the network at the cluster scale. the π

an important criterion to assess the validity of a clustering model is the between-cluster distance matrix d . c1bmarf+, c2bmarf- and c3bmiaa present within-cluster distances  smaller than between-cluster distances , showing a strong definition of these clusters . the within-cluster distance of c4bmoutlier is in contrast higher than the within-cluster distance of the three other clusters. in addition, its within-cluster distance is larger that its distance to c2bmarf-. this configuration can be interpreted in the framework of density-based clustering  where c1bmarf+, c2bmarf- and c3bmiaa are characterized by rather high density of elements with respect to the density of elements of c4bmoutlier. this outlier cluster might be explained in part by biological noise in the y2h experiments.

in the case of the 6-cluster bm model favoured by the icl criterion, two clusters are not well defined in terms of within- and between-cluster distances . the cluster composition shows three aux/iaa enriched clusters and one outlier cluster . this is likely a consequence of the tendency of the icl criterion to select overparameterized models in our context.

taken together these results suggest that the 4-cluster bm model is more relevant both from the point of view of cluster definition and biological meaning. as we will see later, a clustering with three biologically meaningful clusters and an “outlier” cluster is supported by the different models and will therefore be used for comparing the outcome of these models.

building gaussian mixture models
we next used gm models for analysing the a and b valued networks. the icl criterion favours the 5-cluster gm model for network a and the 6-cluster gm model for network b . the more parsimonious model selected for network a may be due to the high dispersion of his <dig> values which have less weight in network a than in network b  . this supports the idea that the x-gal test is more reliable than the his <dig> test. we thus chose to focus on gm models built on the basis of network a .

analysing the cluster composition for the 5-cluster gm-a model, we found three biologically meaningful and two “outlier” clusters . when assessing the clustering quality, we observed that the third cluster, specifically enriched in aux/iaa, presented a rather large within-cluster distance compared to its distances to the other clusters . the two “outliers” clusters not being that well defined too, we decided to compare the 5-cluster gm-a model with the 4-cluster gm-a model since it corresponds to the most relevant clustering found using bm models.

this 4-cluster gm-a model exhibits a meaningful biological structure with three clusters c1gm-aarf+,c2gm-aarf- and c3gm-aiaa specifically enriched in each family of proteins and an “outlier” cluster c4gm-aoutlier. remarkably, c4gm-aoutlier is the merging of the two “outlier” clusters identified with the 5-cluster gm-a model with the exception of iaa <dig> found in c2gm-aarf- for the 4-cluster gm-a model . thus, when assessing clustering on the basis of the cluster-distance matrix  we still observe a rather large within-cluster distance for c3gm-aiaa compared to its distances to the other clusters. since the 5-cluster model favoured by the icl criterion is almost perfectly nested in the 4-cluster model, we argue here that the simpler model is more relevant. again, this can be interpreted as the tendency of the icl criterion to select overparameterized models.

we give in fig.  <dig> the connectivity graph obtained using the 4-cluster gm-a model. we stress here that the mean interaction likelihood  should not be directly compared to the interaction probabilities  represented in the connectivity graph obtained using the bm model  since they do not represent the same information; see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for the clustered valued adjacency matrix with proteins sorted by increasing within-cluster distances.

one should note a specificity of c3gm-aiaa in table  <dig> whose lowest protein to cluster distance  is greater than the highest protein to cluster distances  for the three other clusters. this explain the large within-cluster distance observed for c3gm-aiaa; see eq.  <dig>

comparing bernoulli and gaussian mixture model clusterings
cluster compositions of the 4-cluster bm model  and gm-a model  are rather similar with  <dig> % match . the differences in cluster assignment concern almost only peripheral elements of the clusters and the core of the four clusters are very similar.


the between-cluster distance matrices suggest that the bm model performs better than the gm-a model, allowing for a better definition of the clusters according to within- and between-cluster distances. while it may introduce errors  depending on the thresholds and decision rules defined for the x-gal and his <dig> tests, the binarisation of interactions is thus likely to effectively remove experimental noise. on the opposite, the standardization is a more objective approach, since it scales the outputs of the x-gal and his <dig> tests to make them comparable and limits the loss of information. however, standardization does not remove experimental noise, which seems to be in our case a shortcoming for cluster definition. nevertheless, with both bm and gm models, we were able to identify a strong core structure in the auxin signalling network, closely related to the predicted biological structure  <cit> .

analysing the influence of the protein primary sequence dissimilarities on the auxin network topology using linear regression mixture models
we next sought to address how the evolution of multigenic families such as the one encoding arf and aux/iaa has influenced the auxin signalling network topology by modifying the dimerisation capacities of its members. to get insights into this complex question, we ask here whether dissimilarities in primary sequences of arf and aux/iaa dimerisation domain influence the topology of the aux/iaa - arf network. note that we only present results for network a and use the distance between primary sequences as a measure of protein dissimilarities.

building the dimerisation domain protein distance matrix
one way to analyse the influence of diii/iv primary sequence on the aux/iaa - arf network is to incorporate distances between protein sequences as explanatory variables in a linear regression mixture  model. to build a distance matrix corresponding to the dimerisation domain differences in terms of amino acid se- quences, we started by aligning full protein sequences of all aux/iaa and arf presenting the conserved ctd domain  using clustal-w  <cit> . to recover diii and div amino acid sub-sequences, we searched for conserved patterns among the aligned sequences using gblocks  <cit> . two conserved blocks were found at the c-terminal part of the sequences, corresponding to the two sub-domains diii and div . the per-site protein distance matrix was then obtained using the amino acid substitution model pam computed with protdist. we also computed two distance matrices, corresponding respectively to diii and div, to be used in lrm models with two explanatory variables .

linear regression mixture models with diii/iv as a single explanatory variable
we built lrm models  <cit>  to investigate the influence of the dimerisation domain dissimilarity on the likelihood of interaction between transcriptional regulators. the linear regression mixture model with a single explanatory variable is written as follows:
  xij|i∈cq,j∈cℓ∼nμqℓ+βqℓyij,σ <dig>  

where x is the weighted adjacency matrix  and y the explanatory distance matrix representing primary sequence dissimilarities between diii/iv. as for gm models, μq,ℓ is the mean likelihood of interaction between proteins of two clusters. the regression parameter βq,ℓ quantifies the effect of diii/iv sequence disimilarity on interaction likelihood and is defined for each pair of clusters   <cit> .

introducing an explanatory variable enables to reduce the number of clusters selected by the icl criterion: four clusters for the lrm model instead of five clusters for the gm-a model . the single-explanatory-variable 4-cluster lrm model  exhibits a biologically meaningful structure with three clusters c1lrm-1arf+, c2lrm-1arf- and c3lrm-1iaa enriched respectively in arf+, arf- and aux/iaa and an “outlier” cluster c4lrm-1outlier composed of arf- and aux/iaa; see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for the clustered valued ajdacency matrix with proteins sorted by increasing within-cluster distances. this composition is very similar to the one obtained with the 4-cluster gm-a model  but a bit less to the one obtained with the 4-cluster bm model  .

considering the between-cluster distance matrix  we observe an increase of the arf+ enriched within-cluster distance, while the other clusters show within- and between-cluster distances similar to the ones in the gm-a model . the estimated regression coefficients of the linear regression models are given in eq. 7; see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for a graphical representation of the regressions.

in the case of c1lrm-1arf+, the estimated regression coefficients β^iii/iv, lrm  show that the closer the dimerisation sequences, the less proteins in c1lrm-1arf+ are likely to interact β^c1lrm-1arf+,c1lrm-1arf+= <dig> . however, as shown in table  <dig>  c1lrm-1arf+ is not only made of arf+ but also includes iaa <dig>   <dig> and  <dig>  a closer look  shows that the positive influence detected for within-c1lrm-1arf+ interaction comes from the presence of the three aux/iaa in this cluster. we observed mainly two separated groups : one with low interaction likelihoods  that corresponds to arf+ ⇔arf+ and aux/iaa ⇔aux/iaa interactions, and another one with high interaction likelihoods , that corresponds to arf+ ⇔aux/iaa interactions . this indicates that this result is most likely an artefact.

considering the interaction between c1lrm-1arf+ and c3lrm-1iaa, we also observed a weak but positive effect β^c1lrm-1arf+,c3lrm-1iaa= <dig>  of dimerisation sequence distance on the interaction likelihood . a closer inspection shows a less dispersed distribution of interaction likelihoods , supporting the observed effect of dimerisation sequence distances on interaction likelihoods. similar observations can be made for the interaction between c1lrm-1arf+ and c4lrm-1outlierβ^c1lrm-1arf+,c4lrm-1outlier= <dig> . surprisingly, no effect of dimerisation sequence distances on within-c4lrm-1iaa interaction could be detected β^c4lrm-1iaa,c4lrm-1iaa=− <dig> . apart from these observations, no other influence of dimerisation sequence distance on interaction likelihood could be identified using this model.

linear regression mixture models with diii and div as two explanatory variables
we next tested how each dimerisation sub-domain diii and div could influence the interaction likelihood by incorporating in the lrm models two explanatory variables . the linear regression mixture model with two explanatory variables can be written as follows:
  xij|i∈cq,j∈cℓ∼nμqℓ+βiii,qℓyiii,ij+βiv,qℓyiv,ij,σ <dig>  

the icl criterion favours the 3-cluster two-explanatory-variable lrm model and with a non-significant difference  the 4-cluster two-explanatory-variable lrm model . the cluster composition obtained with the 4-cluster two-explanatory-variable lrm model  is very similar to the one obtained with the 4-cluster single-explanatory-variable lrm model  and with the gm-a model . the 4-cluster two-explanatory-variable lrm model has  <dig> clusters c1lrm-2arf+, c2lrm-2arf- and c3lrm-2iaa enriched respectively in arf+, arf- and aux/iaa and an “outlier” cluster c4lrm-2outlier; see additional file 1: figure s <dig> for the clustered valued adjacency matrix with proteins sorted by increasing within-cluster distances. the  <dig> clusters deduced from this lrm model have similar within- and between-cluster distances  than the  <dig> clusters deduced from the single-explanatory-variable lrm model .

for c1lrm-2arf+ within-cluster interactions, the closer the div sequence distances the higher the interaction likelihood while diii sequence distances had no effect on these within-cluster interactions. however, given that the composition of c1lrm-2arf+ was identical in the 4-cluster lrm model with a single or two explanatory variables, these results are likely artefactual and linked to the fact that the arf+ enriched cluster contains three aux/iaa that contribute to the detected dimerisation sequence influence.

the c3lrm-2iaa within-cluster interactions presents an opposite behaviour when analyzing the influence of the two dimerisation sub-domains: the closer the diii sequences, the higher the interaction likelihood β^iiic3lrm-2iaa,c3lrm-2iaa=− <dig> ; the farther the div sequences, the higher the interaction likelihood β^ivc3lrm-2iaa,c3lrm-2iaa= <dig> . counteracting effects of the same order of magnitude for the two sub-domains thus likely explain why we could not observe any influence of dimerisation sequence distances on interaction likelihood with the single-explanatory-variable lrm model β^c3lrm-1iaa,c3lrm-1iaa=− <dig> .

domain-specific effects were also found for the interaction between c1lrm-2arf+ and c3lrm-2iaa. diii sequence distance is positively related to interaction likelihood β^iiic1lrm-2arf+,c3lrm-2iaa= <dig> , while no –or a very limited– effect of div sequence distances is observed β^ivc1lrm-2arf+,c3lrm-2iaa= <dig> . this is in agreement with the effect β^c1lrm-1arf+,c3lrm-1iaa= <dig>  detected within the single-explanatory-variable lrm model and indicates that the effect of dimerisation sequence distance on interaction likelihood is mostly linked to diii, with little or no contribution of div.

finally concerning interactions between c2lrm-2arf- and c3lrm-2iaa, a weak opposite effect was detected with the two-explanatory-variable lrm model for each domain β^iiic2lrm-2arf-,c3lrm-2iaa= <dig>  and β^ivc2lrm-2arf-,c3lrm-2iaa=− <dig> . again this could not be detected with the single-explanatory-variable lrm model β^c2lrm-1arf-,c3lrm-1iaa=− <dig> , most likely because of opposite contributions from the two sub-domains.

CONCLUSIONS
interpretation of the auxin signalling network clustering and of the contribution of domain iii/iv primary sequences
our clustering analysis provides interesting insight on the underlying biology. first and in accordance with previous work  <cit> , the different models strongly support the idea that the auxin signalling network can be simplified in three biologically meaningful groups, corresponding roughly to the arf+, arf- and aux/iaa  and showing specific interaction behaviours. the strong interaction likelihood between arf+ and aux/iaa was expected from the putative molecular model reviewed in  <cit> . this suggests that most of the aux/iaa repress transcriptional activity of arf+ when a low concentration of auxin is encountered. however, the weak likelihood of interaction between arf- and aux/iaa, and between arf- and arf+ remains a surprising conclusion , given the overall good conservation of diii/iv in arf- proteins. further experiments and analyses need to be conducted to unveil the role of diii/iv in arf- and its possible contribution to the auxin signalling pathway.

using lrm models to investigate the influence of protein sequence distances on the auxin signalling network is a first attempt to establish a direct link between protein primary sequences and interaction network topology. by first using a single-explanatory-variable lrm model, we uncovered a rather counter-intuitive contribution of the primary sequence for a few between-cluster interactions. notably proteins from the arf+ enriched cluster interact more likely with proteins from the aux/iaa enriched cluster that have more distant dimerisation sequences. this suggests that the likelihood of interaction between arf+ and aux/iaa increases with the evolutionary distance between diii/iv sequences. a similar observation could be made for the arf+ enriched cluster and the outlier cluster, further suggesting that facilitated interactions between more distant proteins could contribute significantly to the structuring of the auxin signalling network. concerning the arf+ enriched within-cluster interactions, we detected a positive relationship between protein distance and interaction likelihood. however, this is likely an artefact due to the presence of three aux/iaa in this cluster, preventing us from drawing conclusion from this observation.

the two-explanatory-variable lrm models yielded a more precise view by identifying sub-domain specific effects. our results show that diii explains most of the effect of diii/iv sequence on the likelihood of interaction between arf+ and aux/iaa. recent structural analyses of diii/iv  showed that diii and div mediate interactions between arf+ and aux/iaa through two charged interfaces: one face mostly positive and one face mostly negative. diii contributes principally to the positive face, while div contributes to the negative face of these interaction domains. this structure allows for bi-directional interactions. finding that changes in the primary sequence of diii alone influence arf+ ⇔aux/iaa interaction likelihood then suggests that changes on a single face of the protein impact the global interaction capability. analysing the contribution of each sub-domain also highlighted several antagonistic influences, thus explaining why no effect was detected with the single-explanatory-variable lrm model in some cases. this suggests that changes within the primary sequence of one sub-domain that could influence the interaction likelihood, can be counteracted by changes within the primary sequence of the other sub-domain, an effect that could have occurred during evolution of diii/iv.

so far diii/iv structures have been obtained for  <dig> transcriptional regulators of auxin . obtaining further protein structures, although challenging, could allow testing the hypotheses emerging from our clustering approach. other strategies would also allow testing further the link between interaction likelihood and protein dissimilarities:
creating a library of mutated version of diii and div for each element of the network to artificially enlarge the network size;

generating similar y2h data for other species, such as rice or tomato, which also possess large families of auxin-related transcriptional regulators.



this would be particularly useful for small clusters such as the arf+ enriched cluster, for which the regression model is constrained by the rather limited number of transcriptional regulators. however, it is important to stress here that the y2h experiment was performed using additional sequences than diii/iv for aux/iaa . although there is no evidence that other aux/iaa domains contribute to binding, we cannot eliminate the possibility that this introduces a bias that could affect the analysis of the influence of diii/iv primary sequence distance on interaction likelihood. testing the interaction capacity using only diii/iv protein sequences for both aux/iaa and arf could be useful in the future to address this question. note also that  <cit>  has suggested an effect of the arf middle region on interactions between aux/iaa and arf, thus implying that the interaction landscape could be more complex than the one established in our analysis.

it is finally interesting to compare the composition of the outlier cluster obtained with the different models . four proteins  were systematically assigned to the outlier cluster while three others  were assigned to the outlier cluster for all models estimated on the basis of the valued graph . the composition of the outlier cluster is thus largely conserved for the different models. while this could be interpreted as a consequence of noise in the y2h experiments affecting more specifically these proteins, analysis of the distribution of interaction likelihood involving this cluster suggest that proteins in this cluster might actually have a peculiar behaviour in the network . the outlier cluster is characterized by an highly dispersed interaction likelihood. proteins identified in the outlier cluster could thus be involved in specific interactions within the network, possibly highlighting an unsuspected function for these proteins in the regulation of auxin signalling.
