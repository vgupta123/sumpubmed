BACKGROUND
the basidiomycete phellinus sulphurascens  is the causal agent of laminated root rot , one of the most damaging root diseases affecting conifers in northwestern america  <cit> . douglas-fir  and grand fir  are particularly susceptible to this disease  <cit> . like most root pathogens, ps can live as both a parasite and saprotroph. as a parasite, it initiates infection by colonizing the live bark and cambium of its host, then progressively moves inward to kill phloem and cambial tissues, spreading both proximally and distally from the point of infection. it then enters and initiates decay in the xylem, and finally advances into the heartwood and upward in the stem  <cit> . wounding the roots facilitates but is not essential for parasitic colonization by the fungus  <cit> . as a saprotroph, ps can remain viable in stumps, fallen stems, and roots for as long as 50 years  <cit> . new infections most commonly begin when new roots of susceptible hosts contact infested stumps or roots left in the soil from the previous stand  <cit> . it has been estimated that lrr decreases stand volume by  <dig> – 70% on infected sites  <cit> .

as recommended in a recent report  <cit> , a better understanding of the df – ps pathosystem should help to develop new methods for control. while significant progress has been made on genomic and proteomic aspects of the response by douglas-fir to ps infection , the fungus itself is poorly characterized at the molecular level. aside from taxonomic and population studies comparing its regions  <cit> , no gene sequences from this fungus have yet been reported. a proteomics study of df response to ps infection revealed one protein of fungal origin,  <dig> -benzoquinone reductase, that was up-regulated during infection  <cit> . in the white rot fungus phanerochaete chrysosporium this protein plays a critical role in vanillin metabolism, which is a key intermediate step in lignin biodegradation  <cit> . this finding suggests that lignin degradation may play an important role in the infection strategy of ps
 <cit> .

a small but growing number of studies have examined genes expressed in conifer pathogens, including armillaria solidipes, a white-rot root disease pathogen  <cit> , grosmannia clavigera, a mountain pine beetle-associated pathogen of lodgepole pine  <cit> , and heterobasidion annosum sensu lato, a complex of closely related white-rot basidiomycetes that causes wood-decay in pine, spruce and fir trees , reviewed in  <cit> . in this study, we utilized expressed sequence tag  sequencing to discover some of the fungal genes expressed during the ps-df interaction. to gain insight into the processes underlying p. sulphurascens pathogenesis and development, we constructed and analyzed two cdna libraries: a pure fungal library of mycelia grown on cellophane sheets and exposed to douglas-fir roots , and a mixed library of df roots infected with ps . our data represent the first available sequence information on genes expressed by this basidiomycetous fungus, and expand the public database of genes expressed in forest pathogens. the host plant genes expressed from the ps-df library have been reported separately  <cit> . we identified several ps genes putatively involved in pathogenicity based on homology to genes from other phytopathogens that have been shown to play a role in the infection process. also, because many virulence factors are secreted, we identified which genes are likely to be part of the secretory pathway in ps. including two ps genes sequenced separately from the cdna libraries,  <dig> putative virulence factors and  <dig> other putatively secreted proteins were identified. we designed primers for  <dig> of these  <dig> genes to examine their expression patterns during the first 7 days of ps infection of df seedlings. genes that showed significant up- or down-regulation in the initial screen were further assessed using  <dig> biological replicates. this work has identified  <dig> genes potentially important during ps infection of df. future functional studies on the proteins encoded by these  <dig> genes will more definitively establish their role during the infection process.

RESULTS
titre of cdna libraries
the primary ps-df library had a titre of 106 cfu ml− <dig>  and after amplification the titre was 3 × 109 cfu ml− <dig>  the titre of the ps library was low, with only  <dig>  clones in total. however, we checked a small sample of the clones, and estimated that 90% were recombinant, with insert sizes ranging from approximately 200 bp to 3 kb. thirty randomly-selected clones were sequenced and we obtained  <dig> different high quality reads representing a variety of genes from several different functional categories.

contig assembly and analysis of p. sulphurascensests
after assembly, the  <dig> high quality sequences from the ps library yielded  <dig> unisequences of which  <dig> were singletons and  <dig> were contigs containing  <dig> to  <dig> sequences. for the ps-df library, blastx analysis identified  <dig> sequences with significant hits to fungal genes. assembly of these  <dig> sequences yielded  <dig> unisequences of which  <dig> were singletons and  <dig> were contigs containing  <dig> to  <dig> sequences. there were no non-overlapping sequences among the 5′ and 3′ fungal transcripts from the ps-df library. to assess the overlap between the ps and ps-df libraries, we assembled all of the high quality fungal sequences from both libraries using sequencher  <dig> , and confirmed manually that  <dig> of the contigs contained sequences from both libraries. thus  <dig> of  <dig>  of the unisequences from the ps-df library were also present in the ps library, and  <dig> of  <dig>  of the unisequences from the ps library were also present in the ps-df library. the  <dig> individual high quality fungal est sequences from the two libraries were submitted to the dbest database at ncbi: jk <dig>  jk <dig>  and jk <dig> through jk <dig> , and jo <dig> through jo <dig> . a categorized list of all of the genes from the ps and ps-df libraries are found in additional files  <dig> and  <dig>  respectively.

after trimming vector and poor quality sequence ends, the mean length of all the ps reads was 652 bp, and the mean length of all the fungal ps-df forward reads was 516 bp. based on comparisons with homologous proteins in the public databases, 31% of the ps library unisequences included complete open reading frames , and 44% of the fungal unisequences from the ps-df library contained complete orfs.

functional classification of p. sulphurascensgenes expressed during induction by douglas-fir roots
functional annotation was possible for 72% of the  <dig> ests  in the ps library. in classifying the predicted proteins, we used the mips funcat scheme with a few minor modifications. ‘cell wall degradation’ , which in funcat falls under the subcategory ‘extracellular metabolism’ , was here designated as its own separate category; likewise ‘ribosomal proteins’ , normally a subcategory of ‘protein synthesis’ , were also given their own category. the  <dig> ests were divided among  <dig> broad functional categories, including an ‘unclassified’ and a ‘no significant match’ category. not including these last two groups, approximately  <dig> % of the total annotated proteins were involved in metabolism,  <dig> % in protein fate,  <dig> % in transport,  <dig> % in energy,  <dig> % in protein synthesis,  <dig> % in cell wall degradation,  <dig> % in cell rescue, disease, and virulence, and  <dig> % were identified as ribosomal proteins . of the  <dig> % of ests that could not be assigned to functional categories,  <dig> % were similar to predicted proteins or to proteins for which a function has yet to be determined, and were designated as “unclassified”, and  <dig> % did not exhibit significant similarity to any other sequences in the databases.figure  <dig>

the most prevalent transcript in the ps library, with  <dig> ests, encoded a predicted small , secreted protein with no matches in the databases. the second and third most prevalent transcripts, with  <dig> and  <dig> ests, respectively, encoded two nearly identical hydrophobins. four other hydrophobins  were also identified for a total of  <dig> hydrophobins. other prevalent  transcripts included those with similarities to a putative galactose mutarotase-like protein , translation elongation factor 1a , two unclassified proteins , guanine nucleotide binding protein beta subunit , manganese superoxide dismutase , peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase , an unclassified, putatively secreted protein , and several ribosomal proteins  . a number of sequences matching endoglucanases and ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> were identified, but most of these corresponded to families of related enzymes rather than identical copies of the same transcript. eleven transcripts comprising five groups of metalloproteases were also identified.table  <dig>

of the  <dig> ests from the ps-df library that shared significant similarity with fungal sequences in the public databases, functional annotation was possible for 85% . we excluded all sequences with no significant similarities to known sequences  in our analyses of this library, because it was uncertain whether they originated from ps or df. of the  <dig> annotated ests, approximately  <dig> % were involved in metabolism,  <dig> % in protein fate,  <dig> % in transport,  <dig> % in energy,  <dig> % in protein synthesis,  <dig> % in cell wall degradation,  <dig> % in cell rescue, disease, and virulence, and  <dig> % were ribosomal proteins . unclassified proteins accounted for 15% of the total fungal ests from this library.figure  <dig>

the most prevalent fungal transcript in the ps-df library, with  <dig> copies, was a predicted protein that shared putative homology  with dna-binding helix-turn-helix proteins, which are transcriptional regulators. other transcripts in relatively high abundance included a cytochrome-c oxidase subunit , ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e <dig> , an unclassified protein , a ubiquinol-cytochrome c reductase complex protein , an unclassified protein , and numerous ribosomal proteins  .table  <dig>

ests predicted to be involved in virulence
we identified genes for which there is evidence for a role in the infection process in other pathogens, based on a search of the relevant literature. seventy-nine ps genes identified as candidate virulence factors are listed in additional file  <dig>  we considered all proteins classified in the functional categories “cell wall degradation” and “cell rescue, disease and virulence” to be potential virulence factors. because proteins directly involved in virulence tend to be small and secreted, we identified all open reading frames with a n-terminal signal peptide that make them eligible for secretion from the fungus. eighty-two  of the  <dig> unisequences from the two libraries were predicted to encode secreted proteins .

two additional ps sequences encoding for putatively secreted proteins identified apart from the current study  were added to the list of potential virulence factors: a  <dig>  benzoquinone reductase, originally identified as a protein up-regulated during infection of df  <cit>  , and a cyclophilin, which was identified as a prevalent protein in ps mycelia grown on malt extract .

in most cases, the putative function given in tables  <dig> and  <dig> and additional files  <dig> through  <dig> is that of the protein with the lowest e-value  in the blastx search. where the highest similarity was to a hypothetical protein of unknown function, the putative function of the top match having an assigned name  and its e-value are given. for redundant ests, the clone with the lowest e-value is reported.

expression of putative virulence genes
the outcome of our initial screen for infection-responsive expression patterns in  <dig> candidate virulence genes resulted in the identification of  <dig> candidate fungal genes that may be important in the virulence of ps. these  <dig> genes were significantly up- or down- regulated during infection of df seedling roots . the earliest up-regulated genes at  <dig> hpi were cyclophilin  <dig> , lipase ,  <dig>  benzoquinone reductase , a putative ran-binding protein  and an unknown gene called 2 j <dig> . while the increase in lipase levels was short-lived, cyclophilin  <dig>  the putative ran-binding protein, and 2 j <dig> sustained high levels of up-regulation during the initial  <dig> hpi, and  <dig>  benzoquinone reductase maintained fairly steady levels throughout the 7 day infection period. the greatest increase in transcription levels was for the glucoamylase gene, which gradually increased from  <dig> × at  <dig> dpi  to  <dig> × at  <dig> dpi . similarly, serine carboxypeptidase  showed a gradual up-regulation beginning around  <dig> dpi and reaching  <dig> × at  <dig> dpi . rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase  was also highly up-regulated  at the final  <dig> dpi time point. three hydrophobins showed varying patterns of up-regulation; hyd <dig> expression levels were too low for detection at  <dig> hpi and  <dig> hpi and then sustained at approximately 6-fold up-regulation levels for the rest of the time course , while hyd <dig> and hyd <dig> were briefly up-regulated to  <dig> ×  and  <dig> × , respectively, during the first  <dig> hpi. a gene called  <dig> jo <dig> with low homology to a mapk-interacting protein maintained somewhat stable albeit low levels of up-regulation throughout the infection time course .table  <dig>

discussion
a number of studies have assessed defence-related gene expression in coniferous trees in response to root and butt rot fungi eg.  <cit> . less is known about the fungal component of these pathosystems, although recent studies have begun to shed light on molecular strategies utilized by the pathogens . the current study represents the first analysis of genes expressed by the causal agent of laminated root rot, phellinus sulphurascens. the aim of this study was to enhance our understanding of lrr and improve management of the disease in affected forests.

genes up-regulated during the initial phase of plant infection
in hemibiotrophic and biotrophic pathogens, genes that regulate the development of infection structures and prevent elicitation of host defenses are among the first to be induced, whereas in nectrotrophic fungi, toxins and cell wall degrading enzymes are often among the first to be up-regulated  <cit> . in this study we were most interested in the genes induced during initial penetration of ps into the roots of living trees and the early parasitic phase, with the goal of identifying candidate virulence factors that may be manipulated to halt or attenuate the symptoms of laminated root rot.

our expression analyses indicated significant up-regulation for three hydrophobins in the initial stages of parasitic infection  with one having sustained up-regulation throughout the seven day infection time course . hydrophobins are small, secreted fungal proteins found on the outer surfaces of cell walls of hyphae and conidia. these proteins assemble at hydrophobic/hydrophilic interfaces and thus may be involved in adhesion of fungi to host structures  <cit> . it has also been suggested that hydrophobins might act as ‘stealth’ factors, protecting an invading fungus from detection and rejection by its host plant  <cit> . in the rice-blast fungus m. grisea, two hydrophobin genes play essential roles in surface hydrophobicity and infection-related fungal development, and are required for virulence of m. grisea
 <cit> . in h. annosum s.s, a conifer pathogen with a similar life history to ps,  <dig> hydrophobin-encoding genes with different regulatory patterns were observed. several were highly up-regulated during saprotrophic growth on bark, sapwood and/or heartwood of scots pine, suggesting that this pathogen employs different hydrophobins during growth on diverse wood components  <cit> . a separate study found that two h. annosum hydrophobin genes are up-regulated in aerial hyphae but are down-regulated during early infection of pine seedling roots  <cit> . it is clear that some hydrophobins play a crucial role in fungal pathogenesis, while others are needed for other biological processes.

cyclophilins are peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerases that are highly conserved throughout eukaryotes and have been implicated in a wide variety of cellular processes, including the response to environmental stresses and the control of transcriptional repression  <cit> . in m. grisea, disruption of cyclophilin highly expressed during plant infection resulted in a mutant strain impaired in appressorium turgor generation, penetration peg formation, and ability to infect rice seedlings  <cit> . in the chestnut blight fungus cryphonectria parasitica, disruption of a cyclophilin gene revealed that it is required for virulence  <cit> . we identified a cyclophilin homolog  in our ps library, and previous protein work in our laboratory identified a paralogous cyclophilin sharing 71% coding sequence identity with the one from the ps library . this cyclophilin   showed significant up-regulation during the earliest stages of the infection process, indicating that it may contribute to the virulence of ps.

one of two ps lipase genes  was significantly up-regulated at the beginning of the infection process, and may be involved in using df triglycerides as a carbon source. in fusarium graminearum, targeted gene disruption demonstrated that a secreted lipase encoded by flp <dig> is a major virulence factor of this fungus on wheat and maize  <cit> , and in two obligate biotrophic rust fungi, secreted lipase transcripts were strikingly enriched  in planta
 <cit> .

a gene sharing significant homology with ran-binding protein  <dig>   from rhizoctonia solani was immediately up-regulated and sustained at high levels for the first  <dig> hpi. ranbp <dig> acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for ran gtpase, a master regulatory switch that controls shuttling of proteins between nuclear and cytoplasm compartments. although the function of ranbp <dig> in fungi is not well studied, up-regulation of this gene in ps during the initial stages of infection of df suggests that it may play a key role in mobilizing intracellular signalling pathways required for the fungus to invade host tissues.

given that secreted effectors tend to be small and poorly conserved between pathogens  <cit> , the characterization of small unknown secreted proteins may be fruitful in discovering novel virulence factors. we identified  <dig> functionally unclassified proteins with predicted signal peptides, three of which have no known homolog in the sequence databases. an unknown predicted  <dig> aa protein called 2 j <dig>  was highly up-regulated early in the infection of df seedlings, and a predicted  <dig> aa protein called  <dig> jo <dig> with slight homology to a mapk-interacting protein  maintained a low level of up-regulation throughout the infection time course. we aim to further characterize these unknown proteins in order to determine what role they play in the virulence of ps. in particular, 2 j <dig> was cumulatively the most highly up-regulated of all the candidate genes over the seven day infection period, and was immediately up-regulated at high levels that were sustained for the first 36 hours of the infection time course. the 2 j <dig> protein is highly homologous to several unclassified proteins from fomitiporia mediterranea, a wood decaying fungus belonging to the same order as phellinus.

genes induced and expressed during the parasitic growth phase
white-rot fungi are unique among most microorganisms in their capacity to depolymerize and metabolize lignin. phellinus pini  and h. annosum are examples of fungi that remove the lignin at a faster rate than cellulose or the hemicelluloses in early decay stages  <cit> . this may also be the case for p. sulphurascens, given its close relationship and similar life history to both of these species. our previous work on proteins regulated in df in response to ps
 <cit>  identified an up-regulated fungal protein that shared homology with a fungal  <dig> -benzoquinone reductase, an enzyme involved in degradation of lignin in its host  <cit> . expression analysis in our pathosystem confirmed that this gene was significantly up-regulated throughout the 7 day infection time course. we did not identify any lignin-degrading enzymes in the cdna libraries, even though lignin is an important component of df cell walls, possibly because the df seedling roots were too young for substantial lignification to have occurred. in nature, ps causes severe damage on mature, suberized roots, and some differences are expected between infection events in sterile three-week old seedlings and in larger roots in the forest. however, the fact that our study verified immediate up-regulation of a fungal enzyme involved in lignin degradation in young, scantly lignified seedlings suggests that lignin degradation could be important during the parasitic phase of ps growth in df. in h. annosum p strains, which are more aggressive pathogens and wood decayers than s strains, the oxidizing ligninolytic enzyme laccase is produced  <dig> to  <dig> times more than in s strains  <cit> .

in addition to  <dig> bq, several other genes that were immediately induced remained up-regulated well after initial penetration of the host , including one hydrophobin , the putative ran-binding protein  <dig>  cyclophilin  <dig>  and the unknown secreted proteins 2 j <dig> and 1 j <dig>  in addition to possible roles in recognition, adhesion or penetration of the host, the proteins encoded by these genes may be important in sustaining infection during the parasitic phase of ps on df roots.

genes induced during the later stage of parasitic growth
our est libraries revealed an array of glycoside hydrolase enzymes involved in extracellular plant cell wall degradation , including the pectin-degrading enzymes exopolygalacturonase, pectinesterase, and rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase, the hemicellulose-degrading enzyme endoxylanase, and the cellulose-degrading enzymes β-glucosidase and endoglucanase. we also identified four members of the recently characterized aa <dig> copper dependent lpmos , which support the activity of glycoside hydrolase enzymes through an oxidative degradation of cellulose  <cit> . however, our initial gene expression screen indicated induction of only one of enzyme involved in cell wall degradation: rhamnogalacturonan acetylesterase  , which was highly up-regulated at the end of the seven-day time course. rhamnogalacturonan is a pectin polymer that constitutes a major portion of conifer cell walls  <cit> , and rgas are enzymes which in aspergillus aculeatus have been shown to act in synergy with rhamnogalacturonases to degrade plant cell wall rhamnogalacturonan  <cit> . cwde have been demonstrated to be virulence factors in several plant pathogenic fungi reviewed in  <cit> ; however partially degraded polymers released by cwde can act as elicitors of plant defense  <cit> . biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi may need to carefully time the release of cwde, possibly delaying their up-regulation until a sufficient mass of hyphae have penetrated the host tissues using other routes. this may be the case in ps, given that the one induced enzyme was only up-regulated at  <dig> dpi. in the young seedlings used in our study,  <dig> dpi was considered to be part of the later parasitic stage, because at this point some of the df roots were becoming weak and easily torn. the large increase in rga expression suggests that degradation of plant cell wall pectin may be an important aspect of host colonization, and it is likely that a number of other cwdes, including those not identified in this study, are also involved in degrading df cell walls during the later parasitic and saprotrophic phases.

much research on parasitism has focused on understanding pathogenicity and virulence factors, while the strategies used by parasites to acquire nutrients and adapt to changing nutritional environments are less well studied. a ps glucoamylase  showed increasing up-regulation levels throughout the seven day infection period, and was the most highly up-regulated ps gene at  <dig> dpi, indicating that this enzyme may be associated with the virulence of this fungus in df. a glucoamylase secreted by sclerotinia sclerotiorum was proposed to be important in providing energy to this phytopathogen via plant starch degradation during infection  <cit> .

extracellular proteases can play an active role in pathogenesis, and we observed a putatively secreted serine carboxypeptidase   was increasingly up-regulated from  <dig> dpi to the end of the infection time course. scs have diverse biological functions, including supplying amino acids and energy to an entomopathogenic fungus during starvation and pathogenesis  <cit> . in the rice blast fungus magnaporthe grisea, a serine carboxypeptidase was up-regulated during inductive appressorium formation  <cit> . a recent genome-wide association study of the necrotrophic forest pathogen heterobasidion annosum sensu stricto  yielded an snp marker associated with virulence that was positioned beside a serine carboxypeptidase gene, suggesting a possible role for this enzyme in virulence  <cit> .

psgenes down-regulated during infection of df
one of the earliest plant responses to pathogen attack is a rapid, transient production of a large amount of reactive oxygen species , termed an ‘oxidative burst’  <cit> . this represents a potentially toxic insult that may serve not only to protect the plant from the invading pathogen, but also as a signal to activate further plant defense reactions  <cit> . we identified several ps ests corresponding to putative proteins that respond to oxidative stress, including a manganese-superoxide dismutase  . superoxide dismutases are believed to be responsible for directly inactivating ros, although gene inactivation of an sod gene in botrytis cinerea indicated that this h2o2-generating enzyme is a virulence factor  <cit> , contributing to the accumulation of phytotoxic h2o <dig> levels. however, our expression analysis of the ps mn-sod gene showed that it was significantly down-regulated immediately upon infection of df roots, followed by a gradual increase back to baseline  levels from two days to the end of the seven day infection period. this contrasts with findings in a similar pathosystem, where after 72 hours in contact with pine seedlings, mn-sod expression in h. annosum was almost double compared to that in controls  <cit> . however, when h. parviporum was inoculated on norway spruce tissue cultures, the sod expression profile was almost identical to ours  <cit> . the authors hypothesized that the sod functions in protecting the fungal cell against superoxide produced as a by-product of oxidative metabolism, and that sod activity should correlate with the nutritional status of the fungus, which is expected to be high during growth on the medium used for the controls and during growth on dead host cells in the later stages of host colonization. this would also explain the immediate repression and then gradual increase in mn-sod transcript levels over our infection time course. mn-sod therefore may not be a virulence factor in ps, but may be important during nutrient acquisition in the later parasitic phase of its growth in df.

we identified several other proteins involved in stress response and detoxification of xenobiotic substances, including thioredoxins, glutathione transferases, heat shock proteins, and cytochrome p450s, but due to sample limitations they have not yet been assessed for responsiveness during infection of df using qrt-pcr. our future work will examine whether antioxidant and detoxification gene expression is modulated when ps is introduced to df seedlings.

a number of transcripts comprising five groups of zinc-dependent metalloproteases were identified in the ps library. metalloproteases from two diverse plant pathogens are associated with virulence  <cit> , and given their prevalence in the ps library and putative secretory signals, we considered these enzymes to be prime candidates as virulence factors. it was surprising that a ps metalloprotease was greatly down-regulated throughout the entire seven day time course , and a second set of three nearly identical metalloproteases  were significantly down-regulated in the latter half of the infection trial. although their down-regulation during the infection time course indicates these enzymes lack a key role in the pathogenic process, the answer to the question of why they are repressed during pathogenesis could be illuminating to our understanding of the pathogenic process. metalloproteases are a broad and highly diverse group of enzymes, and it is difficult to hypothesize why they might be down-regulated in ps during infection of df. we found no evidence of similar repression of these enzymes in the literature.

the most prevalent transcript identified from the ps library, a putatively secreted protein called ps <dig> , was increasingly and substantially down-regulated throughout the infection time course. this transcript shared no homology with any sequences in the ncbi database.

future work
future studies aimed at the functional characterization of genes reported here via expression vector and/or targeted deletion experiments will help to elucidate whether the corresponding proteins are important in the virulence of ps. we aim to identify genes that could prove to be effective targets for control of this pathogen. additionally, these candidate genes may contribute to our understanding of the defense mechanisms and gene response of df to ps. this information may be useful for the development of molecular markers for marker-assisted breeding and screening of df that are tolerant to ps.

CONCLUSIONS
in this study we report the first set of annotated p. sulphurascens est sequences, a total of  <dig> unique sequences from two cdna libraries. the putative identity of the majority these transcripts revealed many potential candidate genes that may be essential in the ps/df pathogenicity process. analysis of the expression patterns of  <dig> of these genes during infection using real-time pcr revealed  <dig> fungal genes that are significantly up- or down-regulated during infection of df. in conclusion, this work provides an important inventory of p. sulphurascens genes for exploring cellular events related to host-pathogen interactions.
